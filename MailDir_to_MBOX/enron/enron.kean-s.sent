Terry was acting with full coordination from Jose.  The problem was this: 
Daly insisted someone speak on behalf of the group to the press (and 
designated Terry to be the one); Terry did not have the updated information 
that we were about to meet with the government officials and deliver a 
slightly different message (i.e. that we needed to know if the government 
planned to really open Petrobras or not -- the implication being that we 
would work within either decision but we needed to know one way or the 
other); Terry was simply not in possession of this information and no one had 
given it to him (probably because they had no reason to assume that Terry 
would be thrust in front of the press); moreover, it's hard to see how Terry 
could have taken such a position publicly anyway.  By my eyes Terry did the 
best he could and we had an unavoidable communications bust.  I know the 
Southern cone team is moving to make it right, but I see absolutely no reason 
to come don on anyone about this.

Jim/Steve,

How can Terry go out with public statements without knowing a thing of the 
dynamics of our negotiations with the Minister on the gas issue? This is 
especially damaging given we are depending on the Minister to get approvals 
for our two emergency power projects. Let's monitor this but my suggestion is 
that Jim needs to call Carraro right away and give some explanation before he 
decides to boycot our projects.

See below the messages I had asked Terry to convey in his meetings in the 
region.  I did ask him to raise the issue of Petrobras through Secretary Daly 
with the Brazilians officials as an impediment to the open markets.  

It never occurred to me that he would be making Press statements. (or that he 
would be quoted in this flavor).  This, coupled with the GM ABEGAS) article 
will turn up the heat.

Given that Jim's messages are going to be delivered this week (Denise, Jim 
will discuss the issue with Carraro. We intend to file a protest in ANP by 
Friday due to lack of responsiveness in our request for a transportation 
tariff).........

1)  I would not go to the press. Let it go..

2) If asked, repeat the vision  "regional integration, based on the 
principles of open access, greater reliance on competition and customer 
choice"

3) Monitor the response. Let me know if you are getting unfavorable reactions 
(other than Petrobras).

4) Jim,  if you get a call ahead of your meeting,  we cannot discredit Terry 
(The shadow of Petrobras is an unfortunate quote). Use this in your favor. 
Press on with the message "Is Brazil ready to open the gas market to 
competition". If so, let's get started.

Jose

Terry. 

The Key message for the trip, in regards to energy, should be:

 "Achieve regional integration, based on the principles of open access, 
greater reliance on competition and customer choice rather than regulated 
monopolies"

The vision is that a customer in any of the countries will have choices 
"several competing providers"; "different service options", and the providers 
will have the flexibility and agility to assemble an attractive package by 
combining transactions  with other suppliers and customers.  This approach 
maximizes the utilization of the existing infrastructure (reduces idle or 
redundant facilities) and gives customers the ability to more closely tailor 
their energy purchases to the their needs.

There are barriers to achieve this vision. It is in the interest of the 
governments to work in a common protocol to progress rapidly.

Development of infrastructure .- Still not well developed. Needs to attract 
project financing. At this stage, the customers have few alternatives. 
Government policy should be to allow access above and beyond what was 
initially contracted to justify the financing. Terms of financing have to be 
honored. Long term, competing facilities (pipelines, refineries, transmission 
lines, power plants) will be fighting for customers.

Threat. Control of these facilities: Petrobras through the BBPL; YPF in 
Argentina 

Cross-border Licensing.- Very time consuming, bureaucratic delays to grant, 
export, import, re-export permitting.  Present regime cannot accommodate  the 
rapid transaction scenario which will be required to support real integration.

Cuiaba Power plant,- As of today we have not received all the permits. Latest 
issue is the Bolivian-Argentina border dispute due to YPF denial to 
accommodate a transaction of Bolivian gas into Argentina.

Operationally, the plant will receive daily instructions from Brasilia. The 
gas supply from Argentina/Bolivia, including spot market transaction  has to 
be nominated within 48 hours notice.  There are no mechanisms to change 
quickly the approved volumes.

Commercial entities need to be given the opportunity to export/import to 
aggregate the requirements of different suppliers various customers.

Taxation.- Transfer taxes (i.e. receipt taxes ,stamp taxes) for each step 
down the chain needs to be eliminated for commercial entities, particularly 
for export transactions.

These commercial entities buy pieces of the services on behalf of the 
ultimate customer (act as their agent) and package the final offer. The 
objective to  reduce the cost of the product, which would not be met by 
adding a further taxable event. There should not be  more, nor any less taxes 
because of the services of the middle company, except for the larger amount 
of income taxes generated by increase commercial activity.


Money Transfers.-  Central Bank Controls to authorize the transfer of 
currency needs to be made more agile. Currently these procedures are very 
time consuming and cumbersome (Brazil -- I am not as familiar with the other 
countries)

This is affecting us in Cuiaba. The Central Bank has not approved the gas 
contract, specifically the Take-or-pay provision that has a one-year make up 
period. They want a longer make-up period, but that was negotiated with YPF 
as part of the larger agreement. YPF may agree but at a higher price. The 
Central Bank does not want to send US$ out of the country, so they view TOP 
as a devise of paying for a commodity never received. So they are meddling in 
contract negotiations. 


Below are other notes

Thanks

Subject: Trade Mission

I have forwarded to you the final schedule of meetings for Daly's trade 
mission.  I am very comfortable with issues for Argentina and think we need 
to focus mainly on the stamp tax issue.  Secondly, I would raise the issue of 
open access pipelines, especially allowing Bolivian gas to flow to 
Argentina.  The question I have on this latter issue is whether this is a 
matter of changing the law, changing policy or pressuring YPF to allow the 
gas to flow on it's section of pipe which I understand is not under the 
jurisdiction of Enargas. What can the government do?

JB.- I am not familiar with the genesis of this situation, how these 
pipelines escaped the jurisdiction of the regulator.  If it is determined 
that they are not part of the regulated pipeline network, in time a bypass 
pipeline may be built. But an immediate solution needs to be developed.

In Brazil, I am not sure what to raise.  On Monday we have meetings with the 
Minister of Development, Industry and Commerce and the Secretary of Energy 
and Mines.  What do I need to have Daly raise with them in private?  Myself 
in public? or the Minister of External Affairs?

JB.- For background, the Brazilians have rising concerns of the rising 
dollarization of their economy, "desnacionaliza?ao". Their concern is not the 
US$, it is control. It is that the Old-boys network in Brazil 
Government/Industry, has been disturbed by the New-boys taking control of 
high visibility sectors, Banking, telecommunications, energy.  

Malan, Finance is criticized by the clique that wants the government to be 
active in direct investment and support of big projects.
Complaints about BNDES (Brazilian development bank) lending to foreigners for 
privatization (Recent AES incident)
Tourinho, Mines and Energy-- pushing a new privatization model -- sale of 
stock at the market, not sale of control to a given company. This allows the 
existing management to stay in place. 
If it is the Secretary of Energy, Carraro, his big mission is to coordinate 
the developement of emergengy thermal plants. Big Picture Governement Porgram 
-- Petrobras provides that gas;  Eletrobras buys and remarkets the electric 
energy;  BNDES provides the financing  --- All within the family.

Foreign companies will not play by the rules of the old network. Enron has 
been actively complaining about the gas policy under Petrobras control.

The One Issue I would raise is the lack of competition in the gas sector. 
Petrobras control of the BBPL and national gas. There cannot be true 
competition in the energy sector because the marginal power plants, price 
setters, gas power plants.

As a note, there was a commitment with the World Bank to sell the part of 51% 
control of the Brazilian part of the BBPL pipeline. What Petrobras is doing 
is locking-up the capacity long term, and building a second pipeline.


Of equal importance is our meeting with the Sao Paulo Governor.  What issues 
do we have or what do you want me to say to him regarding our assets in this 
area.  Even if it's to compliment on something, that's fine.

JB.- The State of Sao Paulo, Mario Covas team are to be congratulated by the 
skillful manner that they have conducted the gradual privatization of energy 
sector.  Covas is very influential. His current battle deals with tax reforms 
in Brazil. He is fighting a system of tax-preferences in other states to 
attract industries, which ultimately creates a Federal burden and 
consequently a Sao Paulo burden.

The Petrobras control issue of the gas sector should have resonance.

I assume we have no key issues in Chile at this time. 
 
JB.- There may be some but I a blissfully unaware of them. I would be 
interested on what you pick up

Thanks.

Hi guys,

1. Gostaria de saber se esta declara??o faz parte de um projeto consciente da 
Enron em enfrentar a Petrobr?s ou se foi um descuido do porta-voz.

2. Caso a imprensa nos procure para repercutir tal declara??o que, suponho, 
vai gerar umarea??o extremamente negativada Petrobr?s, existe alguma 
estrat,gia,
 key messages, etc?

Vocs pretendem falar sobre o assunto? O que ser? dito???Thanks??Denise???04. GAZETA: Energia , o alvo dos empres?rios americanos??BRAS?LIA, 15 de fevereiro de 2000 - Empres?rios norte-americanos que ?acompanharam o secret?rio de Com,rcio, William Daley, destacaram o setor de ?energia ?no Brasil como a principal ?rea para investimentos no Pa?s. Segundo o ?vice-presidente da Enron, Terrence Thorn, por,m, 'o monop?lio exercido pela ?Petrobras? tem que acabar para que o setor se desenvolva. Todos devem competir, ?inclusive a estatal'.?Um dos obst?culos ,, de acordo com ele, 'a sombra que a Petrobras faz sobre o ?mercado de energia no Brasil'. O executivo norte-americano lembra que a ?decis?o do governo brasileiro de estabelecer um pre?o ?nico para o g?s ?natural em todo o pa?s , um claro exemplo de medidas que devem ter seus dias ?contados. 'Ficamos confusos ao saber de tal decis?o'. Terrence Thorn acredita ?que um monop?lio estatal pode ser negativo . concorrncia e que a 
privatiza??o 
da Petrobras ter? que ocorrer um dia.
Para ele, o processo de privatiza??o de energia no Brasil vem sendo conduzido 
de forma eficaz, 'mas o Pa?s ainda n?o concluiu o projeto de desregulamenta??o
 (liberalizar o pre?o do g?s natural, por exemplo) e h? muito trabalho pela 
frente'. Segundo Thorn, as empresas estrangeiras de energia podem oferecer 
servi?os
 inovadores para o setor.
'O problema , que o mercado n?o est? preparado'. Ele defende que as novas 
fases da desregulamenta??o do setor energ,tico no Pa?s sejam debatidas por 
toda 
a sociedade.
O interesse dos norte-americanos pelo setor p"de ser visto na pr?pria 
composi??o da miss?o de empres?rios ao Brasil. Das 20 empresas que viajaram 
com
 Daley, dez eram do setor de energia. O representante da Agncia de ?Desenvolvimento e Com,rcio dos Estados Unidos (USTR), Albert Angulo, ainda ?informou? que o ?rg?o est? analisando cinco oportunidades de investimentos dos EUA no ?mercado de energia do Brasil. 'Realizamos estudos de viabilidade para que? empresa venham ao Pa?s, mas o certo , que uma maior desregulamenta??o do ?setor energ,tico seria muito positivo para as empresas norte-americanas', diz.?A vice-presidente da empresa Energy Conversion Devices, Nancy Bacon, defende ?que o governo brasileiro deixe de gastar recursos com a gera??o de energia ?em locais distantes e passe a comprar tecnologias alternativas dos ?norte-americanos. 'Para locais de dif?cil acesso, como a Amaz"nia, a ?tecnologia de fotoc,lulas? , a grande solu??o para suprir o d,ficit energ,tico do Brasil'. (Gazeta ?Mercantil/P?gina A4) (Jamil Chade)????????????

Let's ask Jeff Hines(?), our opinion research guy, to put a few short 
questions together and send it out.  We may also want to include a link so 
people can view the commercials again before answering.

Also,  I was talking with Beth Tilney today about our website (and the fact 
that every business unit now feels free to go do their own thing).  We 
thought it would be a good idea to add this topic to the brand conference 
(perhaps as part of an existing segment).

beauty of doing it in Notes is that it is the body of the email message, so

Mark 

Thanks for the call a couple of weeks ago regarding our new ad campaign.  The 
challenge as I understand it is that we have difficulty in quantifying the 
benefit and effectiveness of our ads.   We can measure on a periodic basis 
what the CEO/CCO/CFO perception of Enron is on a periodic basis but this does 
not break down the impact of our PR efforts from an ad campaign.   I 
understand this dilemma.

But one thing that we could measure that is quite important to me is what our 
employees think about these ads.    If all else fails these ads should make 
our employees proud to work for Enron - and this is something we should be 
able to measure on a consistent basis.

I know you have an upcoming event in California where your organisation will 
talk about problems and challenges we have - so if you could consider this 
idea I would be very appreciative.  And of course don't get to hooked on 
God's country while you are in Napa.

Thanks!

John

Calling All Investors: The New Power Company's IPO Priced at $21 Per Share

TNPC, Inc., parent of The New Power Company, announced yesterday that its
initial public offering (IPO) of 24 million common shares was priced at
$21 per share. The stock closed yesterday at $27 per share. The Company
expects to receive net proceeds from the offering of its shares at=20
approximately
$473 million, exclusive of the underwriters' option to purchase an addition=
al
3,600,000 common shares to cover over allotments. TNPC, Inc.=01*a partnersh=
ip
between Enron, America Online (AOL) and IBM=01*was formed in late 1999 to
provide electricity and natural gas directly to households and small=20
businesses
in the deregulated energy marketplace. TNPC's shares will be listed on
the NYSE under the symbol NPW. Closing of the offering is expected to occur
Oct. 11.

ANALYSIS: I am sure that many eyebrows were raised when TNPC issued the
IPO of its stock at $21, a figure that seemed surprisingly high for a start=
-up
company that has been in operation only since early summer. It is rather
mind-boggling that a company with no significant track record could open
its stock at such a price, but it is not unheard of. In fact, TNPC is=20
following
a trend of new Internet companies initiating IPOs that are supported by
grand concepts rather than tangible success. However, the TNPC "dream team"
alliance between Enron, AOL and IBM has been met with great expectations
(and a lot of skepticism as well) throughout the industry.

I read through the S-1/A filing that TNPC submitted to the SEC, so hopefull=
y
I can cut through the hype regarding this deal to get to its nucleus. First=
,
TNPC acknowledges repeatedly throughout its filing that it is entering
into an extremely high-risk venture, and in fact will "incur substantial
operating and net losses, and cannot assure that we will attain=20
profitability."
Further, TNPC admits that it expects to incur these losses for a=20
"significant,"
but undetermined, period of time. Why, then, would Wall Street be greeting
this IPO with such a positive welcome? One could easily argue that the
sheer market presence of Enron, AOL and IBM has by association driven up
the value of TNPC, but I think a deeper answer lies within several factors.

First, TNPC has been bankrolled by some hefty investments. In two separate,
private placements, investors such as Enron, GE Capital Equity Investments
and DLJMB Partners (among others) put up about $214 million in start-up
capital in exchange for shares in the company. Enron is the majority owner
of TNPC, with 57-percent control. This money has allowed TNPC to make=20
important
acquisitions. For instance, TNPC bought the residential and small commercia=
l
retail energy business of Columbia Energy Group, which includes approximate=
ly
285,000 natural-gas customers and 20,000 electricity customers in eight
states. This is a valuable card in TNPC's deck as it locks in customers
during this time when deregulation is developing slowly in retail markets.
I wouldn't be surprised if TNPC makes a similar acquisition of another
customer base in the near future, such as in Texas, where customers have
been spun off to energy service companies rather than being held by the
T&D operations of utilities. In other words, in Texas TNPC could easily
buy customers without having to buy wires or infrastructure, assuming there
is a willing seller.

Second, and perhaps more importantly, earlier this year Enron transferred
its residential and small commercial retail operations in California and
Ohio to TNPC. This deal included the operations of Enron Energy Services
but did not include PG&E Energy Services, which Enron acquired earlier
this year. Together with the Columbia Energy Group acquisition, TNPC has
come out of the gate running with a significant beginning customer base
of over 325,000 customers. Why would Enron have turned over its residential
customers to TNPC?  Don't forget that Enron struggled in and retreated
from the California residential market, stating that it couldn't make any
money in the retail market. TNPC's S1/A filing confirms rumors that Enron
Energy Services actually retreated from California due to a lawsuit claimin=
g
the company had violated laws relating to advertising directed to residenti=
al
consumers in 1997 and 1998. Enron was in fact banned from selling power
to the residential market in California. Under this customer transfer,
Enron is able to put its money into a completely separate business=01*essen=
tially
moving this high-risk business venture, and worst performing part of its
retail service, off its own books. Yet if TNPC succeeds, Enron still benefi=
ts
as it is the majority owner.

I think these two factors answer why Wall Street has looked so favorably
on a self-described "new company with a limited operating history." Looking
ahead, can TNPC maintain this comparatively high value of its stock?  Well,
there's both good news and bad news for TNPC. First, let's look on the
bright side. TNPC has put into place a great management team, starting
with H. Eugene Lockhart, formerly of AT&T, as president and CEO. Other
key players bring retail market expertise from work at MasterCard, Exxon
and PespiCo. In addition, within the energy industry, TNPC arguably could
not have a better backer than Enron. What other company's touch has been
golden in nearly every venture it has pursued? In addition to being the
majority owner, Enron probably is also providing TNPC access to commodities
at preferential prices, which will certainly enhance its sales approach
in the retail market. Plus, TNPC has access to the 24 million customers
that AOL represents, which I've always thought was the company's secret
weapon.

But then there are the risks, and they are substantial. First, competition
is not materializing rapidly on the retail side. In a state like Pennsylvan=
ia,
which perhaps represents the strongest deregulated market in the United
States, only about 16 percent of customers in PECO's territory have opted
to switch their provider. So, TNPC has an uphill climb, to say the least,
in making any inroads at capturing a lock=01*and making money=01*in the ret=
ail
market. Second, the only way that I can see TNPC making it at all is if
they continue to buy customers like they did from Columbia Energy Group.
There are big questions surrounding whether the company will be able to
do this or not, and much of its success hinges on this uncertainty.

Third, and perhaps most serious of all, is TNPC's vulnerability on the
technology side of its operation. TNPC has entered into a 10-year revenue
management and customer care agreement with IBM Global Services, under
which IBM will manage the company's online commerce and billing application=
s.
IBM's track record in developing customer care systems is less than stellar=
.
In fact, PG&E initiated a lawsuit against IBM a few years ago when the
utility had to pull the plug on a massive $100 million customer information
system (CIS), employed by IBM, which it claimed was ineffective. IBM has
partnered with SCT to provide the infrastructure to be used by TNPC. Under
an agreement between IBM Global Services and SCT, the SCT Banner CIS will
be integrated into a number of back-office IT solutions under development
by IBM for TNPC. Experts in the CIS industry have questioned whether SCT's
Banner CIS can handle over one million customers. If it cannot, this will
surely limit TNPC's growth potential.

Moreover, although TNPC's IPO signals a strong future, there are many=20
uncertainties
surrounding this nascent operation. As one of the few major players in
the energy retail market, TNPC has very few competitors, with the possible
exceptions of NewEnergy or GreenMountain. Another competitor is also emergi=
ng
in Britain's Centrica, which plans to expand in North America after its
recent acquisition of Canadian retail gas supplier Direct Energy.=20
Consequently,
the coming year could either make or break TNPC and the challenges that
the company faces in wanting to conquer the retail market are extremely
steep.

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise

... enough to scare away lifelong democrats.

I got your voicemail.  Thanks for following up. We would be looking for a

steve and rick-
mark halperin is the political director at abc -- the smart guy sitting to
peter jennings's right all night on election night who knew everything. his
brother is a speechwriter at the nsc. you'll see below his recommendation
of
mark katz and his number.

i also emailed peggy noonan to ask for any ideas. haven't heard from her
yet. she's been very busy writing some of the more brilliant commentary on
the current situation which i'm sure hasn't been allowed into the shapiro
empire.

speaking of stock prices, what the hell happened yesterday? i'm still a

your level of apologizing was not necessary but after re-reading my initial

just don't want to break one of the only flows of insider information that
i
have left -- even if it's into a has-been.

but while i have you gravelling, you could do something for me. i just got
a
call from my old boss at enron and he is looking to hire someone as a
consultant who specializes in humor writing. they want to try a humorous
approach in taking on the monopoly utilities in the battle over electricity
deregulation. do you know anyone in the clinton administration who has been
responsible for some of the president's humorous speeches? or anyone that
fits this bill? what about your brother? it seems like i read a profile of
one of them recently who was leaving. the only republican i can think of is
landon parvin who has been around forever.

two people here did stupid things (first me, by in a hurry giving

colleague for sending it to somebody untrustworthy)

so: i apologize...being in a hurry is no excuse for being careless.....

here's the silver linings:

1. gma seems to have gotten it some other way later in the day, so from
there point of view, they aren't focused on where it came from
2. there is literally no one at abc who knows i know you
3. i give you my word that i will never be at all careless with anything
from you again, and won't let even one person have access to
emails/information from you...the person in this case doesn't know it came
from you (or jb for that matter, since i had already taken her name and
your
name off of it)

again, i'm sorry.....i have zero tolerance for such carelessness, and
pleading being overwhelmed with work on the story is no excuse

ps: i hope you saw jamie's interview...it was priceless

We have a leak.

I agree that we should not be opposing rate caps for small customers and 
schools, but I think we should be pounding on the fact that market 
participants have been putting offers in front of sdge and that allowing the 
market to provide this solution is superior to legislated caps that require 
the creation of huge deferrals (and more problems in the future).
Can we make that argument work?

Subject: Re: Daily Update/ Legislative activity - 08/24/00  

I attended Cmmr. Wood's two-day hearing on Wholesale Markets, which concluded 
today (8/24) in San Diego.  Three Commissioner's were present (Wood, Lynch 
and Neeper) with Duque and Bilas participating by phone.  Administrative Law 
Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken.  The quasi-legislative 
hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into 
the workings of wholesale/retail markets.  This session focused on Wholesale 
markets.  There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues, market 
structure and other related issues in the future.  My conclusion from this 
session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory 
intervention in the market.

Dan Larcamp, Director of the Office of markets, Tariffs and Rates, FERC, was 
present.  He relayed FERC's concern of this matter and a desire to hold 
hearings in San Diego.  He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference 
announcing the opening of a 206 investigative proceeding into the operation 
of the wholesale markets in California, which carried with it refund 
authority.

The format of the hearing was to respond to pre-filed questions developed by 
Wood/Lynch.  Each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any 
questions posed by the Commissioners, the Judge or the CPUC Attorney.  No 
questions were posed by members of the audience.  Yesterday's panel of 
academics were comprised of:

1.  Dr. Timothy Duane-UC Berkley
2.  Dr. William Hogan-Harvard
3.  Dr. Frank Wolak-Stanford (ISO Market Surveillance Committee)
4.  David Marcus-Energy Consultant for the Coaltion of Utility Employees
5.  Dr. Gene Coyle
6.  Dr. Jean-Michel Glachant, Universite Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne

The panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any 
institutions they may represent.  While the purpose of the panel seemed to be 
to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too 
high and therefore not just and reasonable, the panelist stopped short of 
blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally.  The 
concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times, but the 
mere existence did not constitute bad behavior.  None, with the exception of 
Dr. Wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of 
his role for the Market Surveillance Committee, had done a study.  There was 
some discussion, though not much, of the monopsony power of the utilities.  I 
think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified 
concerns about the exercise of market power, as even the increase in gas 
costs did not fully explain the recent spikes.  Wolak believes that encourage 
utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of 
real-time market power. 

Hogan seemed to be there with Sempra's interests in mind.  He continued to 
promote expansion of the ISO's abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain 
system reliability.  There was alot of discussion about forward purchase 
ability for utilities so as to be less subject to volatile market prices.  
The concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution 
utility making purchasing decisions on behalf of its customers.  This 
included discussion of separation of these functions and the default provider 
role.  

Most everyone agreed that rolling back to a regulated market was not feasible 
without raising other major and serious concerns, however there seemed to be 
support for some interim measures where cost-of-service regulation may be a 
good idea and that was during peak periods.  All agreed that a demand 
response, and price signals, are important in the long-run, although not to 
the extent currently experienced in San Diego.

Today's panel included representatives from SDG&E, SCE and PG&E, TURN, UCAN 
and ORA.  

While yesterday's panel maintained objectivity as to whether or not 
generators were exercising market power to the detriment of the system, 
today's panel made no bones about the generators being to blame.

SCE/PG&E indicated their need for relief for recovery of market costs in 
excess of the rate freeze.  SDG&E was still on the hot seat for their 
inaction in hedging any of their supply.  SDG&E brought up their failed PBR 
proposal and ORA and UCAN thought that that may be one way to incent the 
utility to be more responsible with their purchases.

UCAN discussed the Governor's direction and the potential for putting rate 
caps into affect for residential and small commercial.  He mentioned that C&I 
customers are experience difficulties as well.  

TURN raised the need for cost-based bid caps and cost-based peaking 
contracts.  Mike Florio, TURN, urged against any further divestitute of 
assets and alleged market concentration on those assets that had been 
divested.  In fact, TURN urged the Commission to seek legislation to clarify 
the Commission's authority to order retention of assets.

Neeper urged that part of the solution should be changing the current 
requirement to use the PX as the only authorized exchange, although TURN 
disagreed.

Siting related bills

1. Good new - The Williamson Act passed the Senate 34-1, It should be heard 
at the assembly Saturday or Monday if it is not redirected to a Committee 
hearing.

2. There was a long meeting with Ducheny with regards to AB 970. The enviro's 
boycotted, they want to draft a bill with Keeley. Labor was obstructionist - 
they wanted to gut all the expediting siting  language with regards to all 
facilities except for the peaking plants.  

Rate Cap related bills
1. The Edison Language on Rate Stabilization may not go anywhere. Edison has 
not found an author because of the efforts of Enron and others lobbying 
against it. Furthermore there are signs that Gov. Davis opposes it.

2. The Governor's office has issued a proposed language for a rate cap bill. 
The language however is not available as of yet. It may be released today or 
tomorrow. SDG&E has shown concerns over the content of the bill. They seem to 
think that it is worse than initially proposed by the Governor in his press 
release. 
The bill includes retroactive rate caps through 6/1/00. 
The rate cap could reflect Wood's rate cap proposal (6.5 cts cap on the 
energy component
The bill does not specify who or how the costs associated with the cap will 
be recovered. (The reasoning is that UDCs will be more cautious in their 
procurement if there is uncertainty on who is responsible for the costs.)
All of this is speculative. We hope to see the actual language soon.

3. Enron has been working with the Republican leadership to promote a rate 
cap proposal similar to the amended language we have proposed for AB2290.
The bill focuses only on SDG&E customers and our major principals are the 
following. 
The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to residential and small commercial 
customers, plus specific institutions that have a significant public role, 
such as schools and hospitals.  
The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to the period ending December 31, 2001.
The Interim Rate Cap must be structured so that any undercollection is 
eventually recovered from the same customers who benefit from the lower rates 
provided by the rate cap.

Question:  why do we need from jan 8 to jan 31 to respond to staff comments?  
I think we should squeeze that time dramatically to take a shot at Jan or 
early Feb resolution.  If there is slippage, I don't want our earliest target

I appreciate you pressing this issue.  You should both be aware that 
Unocal(?) has been sued by the families of four employees who were shot in 
Pakistan a couple of years ago.  Their claim is that the company did not 
provide adequate security and ignored official warnings of trouble in the 
region.

Subject: Re: Security Assessment Report  

Gabriel et al:

Looks like the risks to Enron travelers to (and employees in) Colombia have 
increased.  This is another indication that a 'travel policy' for travelers 
to Colombia should be in effect.  What happened to the one we were discussing 
earlier?  The steps outlined there would go a long way in improving the 
security of our travelers.

Control Risks' report discusses responses to the media - be sure you have the 
approval of Enron's media people before making any response.

The report also recommends suspending bidding on new projects - probably not 
viable advice, but reinforces the importance that additional security 
measures be built into all new projects from day one.

Now that our name is in front of the Colombian public, we could see 
retaliation for various acts, not all of which we have control over.  Recent 
US Government actions such as extraditing criminals to the US for trial and 
training Colombian anti-drug troops have done little to endear American 
businesses to the Colombian public, who see such actions as interfering with 
Colombia's right to govern themselves.  These actions have significantly 
raised the risk of all American companies and their employees in Colombia.

A meeting I had about two years ago with David Beddow of Control Risks in 
Bogota indicated that we could see some changes in the methods of attack in 
urban areas by FARC/ELN.  With an elevated risk level, we should begin 
thinking about these threats.  FARC seldom uses the car bomb method of attack 
because it generates little interest among the domestic or international 
media.  FARC plans on using letter bombs mailed to select targets, i.e., head 
of an American-owned corporation who may have an office in Bogota.  This 
method will generate headlines in the press and generate a fear of FARC among 
businessmen who may be targets.  Control Risks' reported timetable for this 
change in FARC's tactics was to be three to five years, but now that our risk 
is higher, the timetable may well be moved up.

On a related note - did you employ the security person we recommended?

Please let me know how I can help you.

Regards,

Mike Hicks

I hope you and your family are doing well.  I am sorry to have fallen out of 
touch.

I was thinking of you recently wen speaking with a Congressional 
representative from San Diego.  After a summer of rolling brown outs and  
increasing prices from the utilities, he was searching for an energy 
solution.  Who would be the best contact within EES or ENA to explore the 
possibilities for the city of San Diego?

I look forward to hearing from you.

I'm normally not a big fan of conferences, but this one may be of interest.  
I think it may be of even more interest if we don't speak: it's possible some 
utilities may say some of the same things we would say, but they may be less 
likely to do so if we speak and they feel they have to respond.  Let me know 
what you think.

Yes, thanks.  Lay is going to be giving the keynote.  It may be a hard story 
to assemble: the gas market is deregulated and structured pretty much the way 
we would like to see it done in both gas and power markets, yet we still have 
high prices.  It's a bit of a stretch to blame it all on OPEC.  I'm 
interested in any views you may have.

Mr. David Haug 
Chairman and CEO 
Enron Caribbean Basin 

Dear Mr. Haug: 

I am writing to bring your attention to an important and timely event that 
will be held on September 20th at the Hyatt Regency Columbus, in Columbus, 
Ohio - "The Governors' Natural Gas Summit: Responding to the Challenge." This 
event is convened by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC).? 
Co-chaired by Alaska Governor Tony Knowles, IOGCC Chairman and Ohio Governor 
Bob Taft, with the participation of other governors, this forum promises to 
be an outstanding exchange of ideas among leaders of government, energy 
producers, transporters, distributors, and end-users on the subject of the 
current and long-term outlook for natural gas resources and markets in North 
America. A very distinguished group of speakers is assembling, including 
senior government officials and senior executives of companies critically 
involved in the energy value chain.

Primary Goals of the Summit include: 

* Exploring and clearly communicating the current dynamics of the natural gas 
market 
* Informing the industry and the public about the current and future supply 
potential for gas 
* Providing governmental and industry leaders with an opportunity to discuss 
natural gas in the context of national energy policy, with the input of 
interested State Governors.

The Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC) and the governors have 
asked CERA to help organize the Summit and has invited senior CERA staff to 
moderate panel discussions on the Natural Gas Marketplace and the Supply 
Response for North America. In addition, I will be providing an opening 
framework for participants and contributing to the wrap-up of the Summit at 
the close of the day with the governors.? We are very pleased to be working 
with the governors and with the IOGCC and its executive director, Christine 
Hansen.

We hope that you can join us for this important event, and encourage you to 
view the Summit agenda on the IOGCC Web-site at:

Ken Lay spoke with several California CEOs this morning and urged them to get 
personally involved in pushing for a comprehensive set of reforms.  Three 
expressed willingness to help.

Scott McNealy (Sun):  contact person - Piper Cole (piper.cole@sun.com); 
scott.mcnealy@engeng.sun.com.  Mcnealy wants, by close of business today, a 
"cheat sheet" of the talking points to use with politicians (the "8 or 10 
elements of the solution") with the expected comeback he may hear from the 
political leaders and our response to that comeback.  He says he hasn't spent 
time working on issues in Sacremento so we may also want to include a list of 
suggested contacts.
Kevin Sharer (Amgen): contact person - Sarah Jensen, VP of Engineering and 
Operations (805.447.6785); ksharer@amgen.com.  Sharer wants the same 
information as McNealy and he and McNealy both indicated their willingness to 
call a meeting of other California CEOs.  Sharer will also be having 
breakfast with Hertzberg one week from today.
Robert Day (Trust Co of the West):  said that he is very close to the mayor 
of Los Angeles.  He urged Ken to call the mayor (mentioning Day).  Ken would 
like some talking points for that call.

Jeff - please put these items together.

As to whether long term contracting by Cal. is a good idea, the answer is 
somewhat mixed.  We were one of the early parties pointing out the problems 
with total reliance on the spot market and encouraging more forward 
contracting.  Given the utilities' precarious financial position there were 
two options: 1) outsource the default provider obligation to the market (this 
is what we prefer but there was no political support for it), or 2) have the 
state put its credit behind the purchases.  California is pursuing the 
latter, with CDWR prucahsing the utilities' requirements.  In the short term, 
we have criticized the state's plan because it contemplates state takeover of 
the grid; state participation in power plant financing, construction, and 
ownership; and they have not made it clear that CDWR really has the money to 
pay for all the purchases.  I am attaching text I have used as the base for a 
number of communications with policymakers.

In the press, I saw two news stories that I wondered if we (Enron) had any 
role/hand in, and what was the offical "spin" in both cases.  1)  The FERC 
Order requiring something like 55-65 million dollars in refunds by generators 
(or did it include traders) for overcharging in California in December, if I 
recall my facts/news stories correctly, and 2) the reports of 40 companies 
entering into 10-year contracts with California (touted by Davis).  Was Enron 
a contracting party?  Do we think this is a good solution (I think I know the 
answer, but defer to your lead on this, so we stay on your message)?  thanks

Power line plan has new foes
La Cresta residents vow to keep electricity equipment out of the Cleveland 
Forest and a wilderness area.

By Thomas Buckley
The Press-Enterprise
LAKE ELSINORE
A new group has raised its objections to Lake Elsinore's proposed 
hydroelectric plant and the power lines that might carry its electricity to 
San Diego County. 
On Thursday, the Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District board set aside for 
further study later this month a motion by Director Gary Kelley to ensure 
that both the lines and the actual power plant that make up a $450 million 
proposal from Enron North America proceed together. 
But residents of La Cresta, a mountaintop community near where the lines 
might run, did not care whether the plant and lines happened together. Many 
of them do not want the lines to be there at all. 
"We are resolved to keep power lines out of the Cleveland National Forest and 
the San Mateo Wilderness Area," said La Cresta resident Bill Stockmar. "Our 
constituents and the local residents impacted by the proposed project are 
outraged and respectfully demand immediate intervention to stop this project 
at the planning level." 
As it stands now, the power lines from the hydroelectric plant would run from 
Temescal Canyon to Camp Pendleton along the ridge line of the Elsinore 
Mountains just west of the lake. Those lines could run in a narrow strip of 
forest land just west of the La Cresta community. 
Enron project manager Rob Bakondy said the final determination of where the 
lines might run is not set, but he said the power lines could be built at 
least a year before the plant itself. 
Besides serving the hydroelectric plant, the power lines could be used to 
replace lines San Diego Gas and Electric wants to build through Murrieta and 
Temecula to bring power to San Diego. 
The water district also announced it is considering financing and building 
the lines itself. 
District General Manager John Rossi said Wednesday that it was too early to 
say exactly how the lines would be built, but that the district's building or 
owning the lines, or both, in cooperation with Enron is "one possibility." 
Board President Kris Anderson said it is too early to tell whether it would 
benefit the district to become so directly involved in the project. But he 
said the district would be able to borrow the approximately $50 million 
needed to build the lines at a lower interest rate than a private company 
could get. That difference, Anderson said, could mean extra dollars for the 
district. 
How Governor Davis' proposal to purchase thousands of miles of transmission 
lines from the ailing utilities will affect the project is not yet clear, 
said Enron spokeswoman Kathy Russeth. 
The timing of the construction of the project, if it is approved by state and 
federal regulators, will not be finally known until a contract between Enron 
and the water district has been agreed upon. That is expected to happen by 
the end of May.

GOP in a fix over power crisis
Leaders seek solutions that won't undercut past support for deregulation 
By Daniel Borenstein
TIMES POLITICAL EDITOR 
California Republican Party leaders are trying desperately to politicize the 
state's electricity crisis by blaming Gray Davis, but it seems that the 
harder they try the more popular the Democratic governor becomes. 
The latest GOP push will come today when party leaders, meeting in Sacramento 
for the start of their three-day state convention, hold a hastily organized 
workshop on energy. 
"We should be explaining to California that Gray Davis was asleep at the 
switch last year," said one of the scheduled speakers, Republican strategist 
Dan Schnur. "But that message can only work if it's coupled with a proposal 
for an alternative solution." 
So far, that hasn't happened. For all the complaints about Davis, Republicans 
are moving even slower. Looking to 2002, when Davis will stand for 
re-election, the GOP has run radio ads attacking the governor for delays. But 
the party has yet to distinguish itself with a solid plan of its own. 
"If Republicans are able in the next couple of months to articulate a clear 
plan, which is different from the Democratic plan, yes, we can use it as a 
political message," said Stuart DeVeaux, spokesman for the California 
Republican Party. 
"Are Republicans in Sacramento going to come up with a plan that articulates 
a future for our energy problem? I'm not telling you it's going to be 
revealed this weekend. It's my hope it will be articulated this weekend." 
Republicans are caught in an ideological quagmire. Pushing for re-regulation 
of electricity conflicts with the party's basic tenet of less government 
interference. Conversely, arguing for full deregulation puts Republicans at 
odds with a solid majority of Californians. 
A Los Angeles Times poll taken Feb. 14-15 found that 60 percent of 
Californians want to go back to a regulated electricity industry, while 25 
percent are opposed. 
The GOP problem is exacerbated because there is no easy policy solution to 
the energy mess, said Jack Pitney, government professor at Claremont McKenna 
College. "It's difficult to see how we get out of this situation without 
considerable cost. If there were a silver bullet, somebody would have found 
it by now." 
Republicans have attacked Davis for his plan to buy power lines from private 
utilities. "Everybody agrees there's $1 billion or $2 billion in deferred 
maintenance," said GOP consultant Sal Russo, another speaker at the party's 
convention today. "We need to be in this business like a hole in the head." 
But the Times poll found that Californians, by a 52-36 margin, favor the 
idea. Moreover, Davis' job approval rating has climbed this year. In January, 
49 percent approved and 25 percent disapproved. In February, it was up to 
57-26. Californians give Davis better marks for handling the electricity 
crisis than they give President Bush. 
Republicans are going to have difficult time laying the political blame on 
Davis. "It's 'Murder on the Orient Express.' Everybody did it," Pitney said. 
"Although you can make a case that Davis was slow in reacting, no one can 
seriously pin him with the primary blame for the problem." 
The deregulation bill passed the Legislature in 1996 with the strong support 
of both parties and a Republican governor, Pete Wilson. Senate Minority 
Leader Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, is considered one of the Republican 
Party's top strategists. He was also one of the leading proponents of the 
deregulation bill. 
For all of those reasons, Garry South, Davis' political strategist, said he 
does not fear a GOP attack on electricity. "If the Republicans want to get 
into a full-out firefight over how this mess came about, I'm more than 
willing to play. They don't have a very good story to tell." 
For now, Davis' political strength is stable. But the 2002 primary elections 
are still more than a year away, and the general election is a political 
eternity from now. 
"If this isn't resolved, there is nothing to guarantee that there won't be a 
voter backlash against the government," said political analyst Sherry Bebitch 
Jeffe. "And right now the government in California is the Democratic Party." 
That's the message the Republicans want to drive home. But if they can't come 
up with their own alternative, they might have a hard time playing the blame 
game.

Davis says state has tentative deal for Edison grid 


Updated: Feb. 23, 2001 - 4:42 p.m. 
LOS ANGELES -- After a week of intense closed-door negotiations with utility 
representatives, Gov. Gray Davis said Friday he had reached an "agreement in 
principle" with Southern California Edison to buy the utility's power lines 
for an estimated $2.7 billion. 

The deal also requires Edison International, the parent company of Edison, to 
sell cheap power to the state for a decade. 

"This is the framework of a good, balanced deal," Davis said. "It's not a 
final deal. There's a lot of work to be done, But we're making progress." 

The governor said he did not expect customer rates to increase as a result of 
the deal. 

Edison did not immediately return calls seeking comment. 

The state has been in talks for a week to buy a total of 26,000 miles of 
transmission lines from Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric and Sempra Energy, 
which operates San Diego Gas & Electric. The total cost of the lines could 
range from $4.5 billion to $7 billion. 

The effort is intended to help restore the financial health of the state's 
two largest utilities, PG&E and Edison, both of which are near bankruptcy. 
The $2.7 billion price for the Edison lines amounts to 2.3 times the 
estimated book value, Davis said. 

The utilities say they have lost nearly $13 billion since June, trapped 
between soaring wholesale power prices and state-imposed rate caps for 
consumers. The tentative plan announced by Davis would allow Edison to issue 
bonds for a substantial portion of its losses. 

Davis said the state is making good progress in its talks with Sempra and 
"some progress" with PG&E. Thursday, Davis said he will not sign off on any 
grid buyout without all three utilities' participation. 

"I do not believe we can make a satisfactory arrangement without 60 percent 
of the transmission grid, and that would require cooperation with PG&E," he 
said Friday. 

PG&E spokesman Ron Low said Thursday night that talks had ended with no 
resolution that day. 

"These are complicated problems that will not be solved overnight," Low said. 
"There are clearly some issues where we are very far apart." 

Still, PG&E chief executive officer Robert Glynn Jr. said Friday the meeting 
with Davis was a "milestone in the resolution of California's energy crisis" 
and said he was willing to meet further to discuss the utility's proposal. 

"Each utility's issues and opportunities in this crisis are different, and we 
believe that PG&E has proposed a detailed solution that balances ratepayer 
and shareholder interests," Glynn said in a statement issued Friday before 
the governor's news conference. 

The company said it would have no further comment. 

The tentative agreement also calls for: 

Edison parent Edison International to make payments to the utility of about 
$420 million. 
Edison International to commit the entire output of its Sunrise Mission power 
project at low, cost-based rates for 10 years. Davis said that arrangement 
could save ratepayers $500 million over the next two years. 
Edison to provide cost-based rates from generating plants it owns for another 
10 years. 
Edison to drop its lawsuit against the California Public Utilities Commission 
claiming that imposed rate caps were illegal under federal law. 

"This entire transaction, which I believe is fair and balanced for both 
sides, will be accomplished within the existing rate structure," Davis said. 
"We will not be asking any more of consumers to allow this transaction to 
come to pass." 

Davis said negotiations will continue in the coming days. 

Consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield called the governor's plan "an outrageous 
giveaway" and predicted that if lawmakers didn't halt it, voters would 
revolt. 

"The most outrageous part of this isn't even paying 2.3 times what the lines 
are worth, but then allowing the parent companies that siphoned off billions 
of dollars to pay only the tax payment they already owe," Rosenfield said. 

The Public Utilities Commission already regulates how much the utilities can 
charge for power their own plants generate, Rosenfield said.

Utilities Search for Long-Term Fix During Breather
State purchase of power lines under discussion 

Friday,?February 23, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
Sacramento -- A break in the weather and a break in the energy crisis 
coincided yesterday, as California enjoyed its first day in more than a month 
without a power alert. 
With the short-term picture for power improving, representatives of the 
state's three troubled utilities met separately with Gov. Gray Davis and his 
staff to work on a longer-range fix for the power crisis that would include 
state purchase of the firms' transmission lines. Trouble loomed in at least 
one set of talks, however, as Pacific Gas and Electric Co. said it was "very 
far" from reaching a deal. 
The California Independent System Operator, which coordinates the flow of 
electricity through the state's power grid, removed all power alerts at about 
9 a.m. yesterday. Spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley said that with springtime 
approaching and weather improving, and with some power plants coming back to 
full output from maintenance, the overall picture is brightening. 
"We're optimistic," she said. "We're coming into the spring season, the 
majority of generators have had their maintenance completed. But everything 
is dependent on the weather and temperature." 
The last day California had no power alerts was Jan. 13. Since then, there 
have been two days of rolling blackouts in Northern California and many other 
days of Stage 3 alerts -- when power reserves dip below 1.5 percent of 
available capacity. 
The mildest alert, Stage 1, is declared when reserves are between 5 and 7 
percent of capacity. 
The supply of power has been helped by warmer temperatures in other Western 
states, cutting demand there, and by an increase in generators on line in 
California, O'Donley said. 
Last week, when the state was still in Stage 3 alerts, 10,500 megawatts were 
offline in California. Yesterday, there were 8,200 megawatts offline, a 
difference that provides enough power for a couple million homes. 
O'Donley warned that the supply picture in California is still tight, and 
conservation still necessary. But the focus of attention was turning to 
Sacramento and Davis' talks with the utilities. 
Davis announced a plan last week for the state to purchase 26,000 miles of 
utility-owned transmission lines in exchange for backing bonds that allow the 
utilities to repay the almost $13 billion in debt they say they owe. 
While Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric have 
indicated willingness to sell their lines, PG&E has refused to comment on the 
proposal. 
It is not clear if PG&E is unwilling to sell or simply trying to strike a 
harder bargain. The utility had accumulated more debt than its Southern 
California counterparts, and also owns the largest part of the transmission 
line grid. 
Talks between Davis' staff and PG&E did not start until late yesterday 
afternoon, and indications were that they were more difficult than 
negotiations involving the other two utilities. 
"They're just on a different page," Michael Peevey, the former Edison 
president who is Davis' chief negotiator, told Bloomberg News. 
PG&E spokesman Ron Low said, "These are difficult problems that cannot be 
solved overnight. There are clearly some areas where we are very far apart." 
Davis hopes to make an announcement with at least one of the utilities before 
leaving today for the four-day National Governors Association meeting in 
Washington, D.C. 
The union that represents some 11,000 PG&E employees, meanwhile, called on 
Davis to negotiate state ownership of two power plants under construction in 
which PG&E holds large stakes. 
Jack McNally, business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical 
Workers, Local 1245, in Walnut Creek told Davis in a letter that a 
transmission line takeover would be a "grand experiment" fraught with danger. 
Acquiring the two prospective power plants, in Kern and San Diego counties, 
would do more to address energy shortages than taking over transmission lines 
that need hundreds of millions of dollars in maintenance, union officials 
said. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio countered that state acquisition of 
transmission lines "would not affect one union job," as the state would 
simply lease the grid back to the utilities. Maviglio predicted union jobs 
would increase with investment in new capacity and system upgrades. 
Chronicle staff writers Patrick Hoge and Robert Salladay contributed to this

State's energy price tag increases 
Published Friday, Feb. 23, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News 
BY DION NISSENBAUM 

Mercury News Sacramento Bureau 


SACRAMENTO -- California's energy crisis took another big bite out of the 
state budget Thursday when finance aides to Gov. Gray Davis announced that 
the cost of buying energy may top $3 billion by mid-March. 
In a move that raised new alarms for lawmakers, the governor's finance team 
for the third time this month asked for $500 million to buy electricity in 
the coming weeks while Davis tries to work out a deal to bail out the state's 
near-bankrupt utilities. That, combined with money spent last month to buy 
energy, could drain the state coffers of $3 billion by St. Patrick's Day. 
The request for more cash came on the same day that California spent its 
first day in weeks without an official energy emergency and Davis held 
critical talks with the heads of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and San Diego Gas 
& Electric Co. The talks are aimed at rescuing the two companies and Southern 
California Edison from financial collapse. 
While Davis had expressed hope last week of working out a deal by today, 
sources said that an agreement still remains elusive. 
Until a compromise can be hammered out, the state is being forced to pay 
upward of $50 million a day from the general fund to buy electricity. 
State leaders expect that the money will eventually be repaid to the general 
fund under a $10 billion bond package. But lawmakers are growing increasingly 
concerned about the short-term impact on the state fiscal plan. 
Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, said the latest request for 
more money could create ``greater concern and anxiety'' among lawmakers and 
added that the energy crisis was going to make it harder to fund other 
programs, such as support for abused children. 
``It's going to be a bleak year for other budget priorities,'' said Migden, 
who is chairwoman of the powerful Assembly Appropriations Committee. 
Earlier this week, the state's independent financial analyst warned that the 
energy crisis could eat into state money the governor wants to spend on other 
things such as the environment and public safety. 
While lawmakers have so far bitten their tongues about the growing power 
price tag, Migden said the Legislature might be hesitant to allow the costs 
to go any higher. 
``I can't imagine another infusion after this being required,'' Migden said. 
``I think this has to be the last request because we're going to hit 
fundamental core programs.'' 
Waiting for bailout plan 
California stepped in to buy the energy last month after PG&E and Southern 
California Edison lost the financial wherewithal to do it themselves. At the 
time, state leaders reluctantly agreed to buy the energy for a short period 
of time as part of a larger plan for California to sign long-term contracts 
with power generators. 
But those negotiations have failed to produce much energy so far, and Davis 
said earlier this week that the power producers are hesitant to sign any 
deals until California agrees to a bailout plan for the utilities. On 
Thursday, one power producer -- Williams Cos. -- announced that it had signed 
a 10-year contract with the state to provide up to 1,400 megawatts of power 
to California. 
In a bid to work out the bailout plan, Davis and his advisers met Thursday 
and were to meet again today with top executives from all three electric 
utilities in financial trouble. The Democratic governor wants to buy 26,000 
miles of high voltage transmission lines owned by the three companies in 
exchange for helping the utilities pay off $13 billion in debts. The 
utilities are being asked to protect thousands of acres of wilderness lands 
they own, hang onto power plants that provide the state with its cheapest 
electricity, and drop explosive lawsuits that could allow the companies to 
dramatically raise customer rates. 
But sources said talks have bogged down on the transmission line deal, which 
PG&E has been reluctant to accept. 
Alternative energy helps out 
While talks slogged along in the governor's office, state lawmakers announced 
that another key piece of the puzzle needed to solve the energy crisis was 
falling into place. 
State Sen. Jim Battin, R-Palm Desert, and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Santa 
Cruz, said that alternative energy producers had agreed to dramatically lower 
their prices in a deal that could save California $3 billion to $4 billion. 
Those energy producers, nearly 700 wind, solar and natural gas-fired plants, 
provide about a third of the state's energy.

Paying for power still a big question
POWER CRISIS 
PG&E doesn't like the plan the PUC proposed to collect electricity costs 
By Mike Taugher
TIMES STAFF WRITER 
Three weeks after Gov. Gray Davis signed into law the state's centerpiece for 
stabilizing energy costs, big differences remain over how the solutions will 
be implemented and who will pay for them. 
The plan, outlined in legislation known as AB1X, was intended first to stop 
the financial bleeding of California's two largest utilities by asking the 
state to buy enough unsecured power to keep the lights on. Next, the state 
would enter long-term contracts for less expensive power that would 
eventually lessen the need for more costly, last-minute electricity. 
But the state has balked at buying the entire portfolio of last-minute 
electricity that is needed, and a disagreement emerged Thursday over what 
portion of consumers' bills should be used to reimburse state coffers. 
Meanwhile, progress on completing contracts has been slow, although two were 
signed Thursday. 
A spokesman for Davis said more contracts for relatively low-cost power would 
be signed once the state bought the utilities' transmission lines and other 
assets, because then the utilities could pay their past-due bills. The 
governor said last week that he expected a deal with the utilities by today, 
but that might not happen. 
"Clearly, there's been challenges getting long-term contracts, but we've 
turned the corner," said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. "We've got three in 
the bank and 10 more once we get these deals (with the utilities) done." 
Also Thursday, the Public Utilities Commission was poised to allow the state 
to collect the entire amount that customers pay specifically for electricity. 
But Pacific Gas & Electric Co. said it is entitled to deduct other costs from 
customers' payments before reimbursing the state. That would reduce payments 
from PG&E to the state by about half, according to the company. 
The PUC proposal was in response to a request from the state Department of 
Water Resources that it be allowed to start collecting money so that energy 
companies would be more willing to sell power to the agency. 
The two Republican-appointed commissioners of the PUC blocked the move, which 
needed four of five commissioners' approval to reach the agenda. 
"DWR's (action) is exacerbating a problem AB1X was meant to alleviate," said 
Commissioner Richard Bilas. "It is pushing the utilities closer to 
bankruptcy." 
PG&E spokesman John Nelson said the proposal brought by PUC President Loretta 
Lynch would have been unfair to the utilities because AB1X allows them to 
deduct expenses for buying electricity and generating energy at their own 
power plants before reimbursing the state. 
"All of those costs need to be paid going forward. Otherwise, you still leave 
the utilities to bleed," Nelson said. 
That stance appeared to be at odds with the office of Assemblyman Fred 
Keeley, the Boulder Creek Democrat who wrote AB1X. 
"For PG&E to think it can keep money for electrons it never even owned is 
astounding to us," said Guy Phillips, a Keeley aide. 
While nothing has gone smoothly, Phillips and others expressed optimism that 
the state's biggest effort to date to fix the energy crisis would work. 
"We think those will be sorted out," said Phillips, who acknowledged there 
has been much confusion about what lawmakers intended in AB1X. 
For example, Keeley's office said lawmakers wanted the water resources agency 
to make up the entire amount of electricity that the state's two largest 
utilities had not secured ahead of time. The high cost of this last-minute 
electricity -- and the utilities' heavy reliance on it -- is what drove PG&E 
and Southern California Edison to the brink of bankruptcy. 
But the water agency has balked at buying electricity offered at prices it 
calls "unreasonable." While state officials have refused to say how much 
electricity it has left to utilities to purchase, the state is paying about 
$55 million a day to keep electricity flowing. 
And that amounts to about 90 percent of the electricity purchased on behalf 
of the utilities on the same day it is needed, according to Phillips. 
The state's reluctance to buy all of the so-called real-time electricity has 
led to fears that the utilities will continue to run up debt and that power 
companies will not collect money owed to them. That dispute has landed in 
federal court, where a Sacramento judge is forcing three major power 
suppliers and a marketing company to continue selling power in the state. 
If a settlement is not reached today, U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell is 
expected to decide whether to extend his order, to modify it or to drop it.

Lowenthal returns utility money 

By Will Shuck
>From our Sacramento Bureau 

SACRAMENTO Assemblyman Alan Lowenthal, D-Long Beach, this week joined a small 
group of legislators who returned campaign contributions to California 
utility companies and other energy firms. 

He sent $5,000 back to Southern California Edison and $500 to Sempra Energy, 
parent company of Southern California Gas. It was a small portion of the more 
than Lowenthal $500,000 Lowenthal had raised in 2000 for his re-election 
campaign. 
He said he returned the money, as did nine other Assembly members, at the 
urging of the consumer advocacy group Global Exchange. 
"We think it's fantastic that he has recognized that in the eyes of the 
public there is a very serious potential conflict of interest," said group 
spokeswoman Medea Benjamin. "We applaud him for wanting to ensure the 
integrity of the legislative process." 
While Benjamin says it's critical that lawmakers not be tainted by energy 
money during the state's power crisis, others wonder where the line should be 
drawn. 
"In the real world of politics it costs money to run for office and you have 
to get that money somewhere," said Paul Schmidt, a political science 
professor at Cal State Long Beach. "To say that you can only make decisions 
on things involving individuals that haven't given you any money would result 
in paralysis of government." 
Benjamin and other consumer advocates say the power crisis calls for special 
consideration. 
"There are not many cases in which they're actually voting whether a company 
will survive with billions of dollars of taxpayer money or go bankrupt, as 
they're doing with the utility companies," Benjamin said. 
Lowenthal agreed. "I thought it was an appropriate request," he said. "These 
are unique circumstances, and I just think it's in the public's best interest 
that I return that money."

Dan Walters: A power grab by politicians 


(Published Feb. 23, 2001) 
Slowly, but inexorably, control over the generation, acquisition and 
distribution of electric power in California is being shifted from 
professional utility managers and independent regulators into the hands of 
politicians. 
The 1996 utility "deregulation" scheme enacted by the Legislature was an 
initial foray into politicization. Legislation granting the governor more 
control over the makeup of the Public Utilities Commission was another. But 
the current power supply/price crisis has led to even more direct political 
influence over -- or interference with -- electric service. One hastily 
enacted bill, for example, gives the governor direct control of the 
now-misnamed "Independent System Operator," which operates the statewide 
power grid. 
More political intrusion is in the works, from a state takeover of the 
intercity power transmission grid to the creation of a state power authority 
that would buy, generate and sell electricity directly. And while local 
public utilities function well, a state power agency might operate on the 
whims of professional politicians. The Legislature, for example, wants 
appointments to the board that would direct a state power authority, and big 
state power projects would be subject to the same kind of pork-barrel 
mentality that distorts other public works appropriations. Where power plants 
were to be built, or where high-voltage lines would be strung, might well 
depend on who could, and could not, bring political influence to bear, rather 
than what the system needed to work efficiently. 
Clues to the potential pitfalls of a state-operated power system are found in 
the approaches of Capitol politicians to the current crisis. There is, for 
example, the unspoken goal of avoiding big power rate boosts until after the 
November 2002 election -- even if it means running up billions of dollars in 
debts to do it. Would future rates charged by a state power authority be 
raised or lowered to enhance the prospects of the dominant party or an 
incumbent governor? There's no evidence in past performances to indicate they 
wouldn't be. 
And then there's the knotty question of who would get vital power supplies in 
the event of shortages -- a situation that is already looming and could 
become worse in future months. 
Emergency legislation already gives the state the right to sell power as it 
pleases, without competitive bidding or even public notice. There's nothing, 
really, to prevent politically influential power customers such as big 
industrial enterprises from cutting their own supply deals with politically 
directed state officials. 
And whose juice would be cut off if shortages mean blackouts? Approximately 
45 percent of current power customers are effectively exempt from rolling 
blackouts because they are connected to circuits (called "blocks") that also 
include vital services, such as hospitals, fire and police agencies, water 
supply systems and communications centers. The Capitol, not surprisingly, is 
in one of those noninterruptible blocks. 
With the threat of further blackouts looming, legislation is being drafted to 
designate which customers will suffer and which will not -- thus taking that 
authority out of the hands of utilities and regulators. And that, in turn, is 
generating pressure from lobbyists from all sorts of interest groups to place 
their clients on protected lists. Should farmers be cut off, or biotechnology 
facilities, or computer chip plants, or schools? 
When politicians control any process or system, one can be certain that they 
will always make expedient political decisions, regardless of the long-term 
or wider consequences. Thus, we may someday regret allowing the Capitol's 
self-serving politicians to get their hands on our electric power system.

Discount Urged Near Power Plants
Senator urges electricity rate break for neighbors of generators 

Friday,?February 23, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
As California officials propose building 32 new "peaker" power plants across 
the state by July, one legislator from plant-rich eastern Contra Costa County 
thinks residents should get a discount on their power bill for having a 
generator in their backyard. 
The proposed bill would provide a little payback for residents of state Sen. 
Tom Torlakson's district, which is home to a half-dozen plants and has three 
more in the construction pipeline. 
Under the bill introduced yesterday by Torlakson, D-Antioch, people living 
within a 20-mile circle around a power plant would receive a 20 percent 
discount on their electricity bill and be exempt from blackouts. 
The legislation was partially inspired by San Jose officials' rejecting a 
proposal to build a 600-megawatt power plant in the Coyote Valley, as well as 
Gov. Gray Davis' plan to build 5,000 megawatts of new generating capacity by 
July 1. 
"It's a question of fairness," Torlakson said. "People in communities who are 
shouldering the burden for having plants in their backyard should get some 
benefit from it." 
Torlakson said consumers who lived in communities without plants could pick 
up the tab for the discounts. "But the utilities would have to figure that 
out within their rate system," he said. 
A PG&E spokesman said yesterday that the company does not comment on pending 
legislation. 
While consumer advocates, environmentalists and power generators were 
lukewarm to the proposal yesterday, many admit that the state has not thought 
about how to -- of even if they have to -- offer communities a little 
incentive to approve a power plant within their borders. However, the state 
has allocated $30 million for plants that get online by July 1. 
"As far as incentives, I'd think most communities would see the value of the 
employment they'd get and the increase to the tax base," said Larry Hamlin, 
the governor's recently appointed project manager for the plant-building 
campaign. 
A spokesman for California's Environmental Protection Agency, which permits 
plants, said the plan might be a "worthwhile idea for making power plants 
more palatable to Californians." 
Michael Shames, head of Utility Consumer Action Network in San Diego said the 
bill was attacking a "not in my back yard" problem that doesn't exist. "Many 
San Diego communities are clamoring for plants in the hope that they would 
bring stability to the market," he said. 
James Peters of Mirent, the Atlanta-based company formerly known as Southern 
Energy, said the plan wouldn't encourage generators to build the number of 
plants needed to solve the energy crisis. 
Already, communities like Pittsburg have cut deals with power generators 
before letting them build. In exchange for letting the Calpine Corp. build 
two large plants in town, Pittsburg received the lifetime option to purchase 
100 megawatts of power at below-market rates. 
Next week, a Pittsburg group is going to begin gathering signatures demanding 
that city leaders use the estimated 26 megawatts it would take to light 
residences and businesses to give local residents a break on bills. The group 
will hold an organizational meeting at 7 p.m. Tuesday at the Los Medanos 
Community Hospital, 2311 Loveridge Rd. in Pittsburg.

At last, power alerts are lifted: Enjoy respite because crisis far from 
resolved, experts say
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
(Published Feb. 23, 2001) 
As oddly as it arrived, California's electric emergency lifted Thursday 
morning. 
At 9 a.m., the Independent System Operator, which controls most of 
California's grid, ended a Stage 1 alert. 
It was the first time since Jan. 13 that the state hadn't been under a power 
emergency, declared when low supplies threaten grid stability. The alerts 
included 32 straight days of Stage 3 emergencies, the black clouds that 
gather before rotating outages. 
The clouds cleared on a day when predicted peak use was low -- but not the 
lowest it has been for the last five weeks. Many power plants were back on 
line after repairs -- but more plants had been operating during at least one 
Stage 3 day. 
So what happened? 
A little luck, a little planning and maybe a little group psychology, said 
those who have closely watched recent gyrations of the state's electric 
roller coaster. 
"It is a roll of the dice," said Gary Ackerman, head of the Western Power 
Trading Forum, which represents plant owners and marketers. "If it continues 
for the next three or four weeks I wouldn't be too surprised. That'll be our 
respite. Enjoy it." 
The end of a 40-day string of emergencies could mean a few more lights in 
store aisles or a little less worry about running an electric furnace. Some 
speculated it might also mean lower wholesale prices. 
But major changes are not likely in the steady rain of conservation calls 
that have fallen on Californians since the north state was twice plunged into 
rotating blackouts last month. 
"I hope people don't just go back to wasteful ways," said Mike Florio of The 
Utility Reform Network, a consumer group. 
Now that the emergencies have dissipated, "we don't have to talk about 
imposing hardships on people, but prudent use of energy is an idea we're 
going to have to live with for a long time," he said. 
At the ISO, longer days and slightly warmer weather was credited with 
decreasing peak demand for electricity. Supplies are up within the state, and 
power imports from the Pacific Northwest have risen significantly, said Jim 
Detmers, who manages grid operations. 
Plus, in one of the biggest changes, the state Department of Water Resources 
has begun getting more power supplies lined up at least a day in advance, he 
said. 
Since the department stepped in to buy power on behalf of cash-strapped 
utilities, it has often managed to line up about 70 percent to 75 percent of 
what the state needed to supplement utility-controlled supplies, according to 
Detmers. That meant grid operators had to scramble to buy the rest on very 
short notice. 
But starting last Friday, the state began to schedule about 90 percent of its 
purchases at least one day in advance. 
"The operators are able to enter a day with a lot more confidence about being 
able to make it," Detmers said. "You don't have to search to find those 
megawatts at the last minute." 
Closely in sync with increased purchases by the state, the ISO dropped from a 
Stage 3 emergency to Stage 2 on Friday, and then slid to a Stage 1 Wednesday. 
The stages are based on how much reserve power is left for unexpected crises; 
a Stage 3 is declared when reserves slip below 1.5 percent. 
For their part, power buyers at the water resources department weren't sure 
what has made the difference over the past few days. 
"It's certainly not that people are lining up to sell us power at cheap 
prices," said Jim Spence, the department's director of emergency operations. 
"We're just buying whatever we can, and it turned out that it was easier to 
make ends meet." 
He said he couldn't make any prediction about how long that would last. 
The string of power emergencies has been unpredictable from the start, 
erupting in winter, when California's hunger for electricity traditionally 
declines and supplies are usually so flush that plants close for tune-ups. 
Consumer advocates and power traders blamed finances for the emergencies, 
rather than a fundamental lack of supply, as fears of utility bankruptcies 
triggered a descent into market chaos and high-stakes political maneuvering. 
But basic supply shortages are expected to move to the forefront by summer, 
when temperatures rise and demand soars. 
Meanwhile, the brief respite -- whatever the reason -- brought palpable 
relief to those charged with keeping the power grid stable. 
"When we found out yesterday during the board meeting that we were only in 
Stage 1, we broke out in applause," said Florio, who sits on the five-member 
ISO board. 
The change also could be good news for consumers, who may one day be paying 
higher rates for the wholesale electricity now being purchased by the state. 
"Getting out of a Stage 3 typically means prices are going to ease," Florio 
said. "When you're even in a Stage 1, that's a signal to everybody, 'They're 
short, that means we can hold them up now.' "

Davis' deadlines on energy much easier set than met
By Emily Bazar
Bee Staff Writer
(Published Feb. 23, 2001) 
Exactly one week ago, Gov. Gray Davis sounded hopeful, optimistic even, when 
he predicted that the state and its debt-ridden utilities would forge an 
agreement by today on a plan to save the companies from financial doom. 
Problem is, it won't work out that way. 
Negotiations between state officials and the investor-owned utilities have 
produced no comprehensive agreement to announce today. 
Davis' predictions during the energy crisis have been wrong before. 
For weeks, he has set deadlines for agreements and legislative action that 
haven't been met. On deadline days, even when there's little substantive 
progress to report, Davis often holds news conferences anyway -- many of them 
on Friday afternoons after financial markets close. 
The Democratic governor's office scheduled an "announcement" for today in Los 
Angeles, even though one utility representative said agreement is far away. 
Davis' actions have fueled speculation that he's trying to force consensus by 
setting artificial deadlines and putting a spin on the news, and tarnishing 
the state's credibility in the process. 
"I can't see how you would negotiate such a complex deal, like the purchase 
of the transmission grid, in such a short period of time. It doesn't seem 
realistic," said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an 
association of wholesale generators. "I guess the people I represent have 
turned it off. They have stopped listening. They hear it and say, 'OK, sure. 
Here's another photo op.' " 
Last Friday, Davis told a gathering of reporters that state officials and the 
utilities would agree by today on a rescue plan for the utilities. 
"I believe we'll have agreement before next week is out, on exactly what 
should go in a piece of legislation," he said at the time. "And hopefully, 
that legislation will be passed by the end of the following week." 
Legislative veterans said his comments were ill-advised and unrealistic. 
Davis met into the night Thursday with top officials of Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co., but no agrement was reached. 
"These are complicated problems that will not be solved overnight," said PG&E 
spokesman Ron Low. "On some issues, we are very far away from agreement." 
Sources said PG&E has been unwilling to negotiate sale of its transmission 
lines, which Davis has said is a necessary component of a deal. More progress 
was reported with the two other near-bankrupt companies -- San Diego Gas and 
Electric Co. and Southern California Edison -- although sources said talks 
with them were far from concluded. 
Davis has been setting specific deadlines for himself and the Legislature for 
months: 
In November, the governor promised to present a comprehensive "plan" by Dec. 
1 to stave off a full-blown energy crisis, but ended up offering only a 
modest slate of proposals. 
Davis called Feb. 12 a "drop dead" date by which he hoped to cement a deal 
between lawmakers and the utilities. There's no deal yet. 
Davis told reporters that he and the state's legislative leaders would reach 
a "consensus agreement" on the proposal to take to utilities by last Friday. 
It didn't happen; he made the announcement alone. 
Leon Panetta, a White House chief of staff under former President Clinton, 
said it's important that the governor set deadlines because the nature of 
politics is to delay. 
However, he cautioned against missing deadlines. 
"You have to be careful that you keep the deadlines you establish, because 
the more that you establish and not meet, the more that begins to lose its 
value as a political tool," Panetta said. 
The governor can't continue to indefinitely set deadlines without facing 
consequences, cautioned Steven Fetter, managing director of the Global Power 
Group at Fitch, a credit-rating agency based in New York. 
At some point, he warned, creditors and power suppliers may push the 
utilities into involuntary bankruptcy, which would trigger an official 
deadline that can't be ignored. The dispute would be tied up in court at a 
judge's discretion. 
"Eventually, there is going to be a real deadline," Fetter said. "The problem 
is it's probably not a deadline that will be set by Gov. Davis. It's a 
deadline that will be set by the banks and the (electricity) suppliers." 
In several cases when deadlines haven't been met, Davis has held a news 
conference regardless, unveiling little new information and scant detail. 
On Jan. 26, for instance, the governor promoted the broad framework of a plan 
to save the utilities rather than a detailed plan that had been anticipated. 
One prong of the plan: "Aggressively promote energy efficiency, conservation 
and demand reduction among consumers, businesses and public entities." 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said that the governor continues to set 
deadlines because it's important to show that the state is making progress, 
particularly to Wall Street. 
He added that it's not the governor's fault the deadlines have been missed. 
"Many of the dates have been blown away by factors no one has been able to 
foresee or have control over: court decisions, actions by creditors, weather, 
you name it," Maviglio said. "The governor sets deadlines that continue to 
move the ball forward and he has been successful at doing that." 
Many of these announcements came after 2 p.m. on Fridays, triggering 
suggestions that the governor has attempted to spin the facts and manipulate 
the markets. 
Timing announcements after the close of East Coast financial markets is 
commonly used by politicians who don't want to send stocks soaring or 
tumbling by making an announcement, Panetta said. 
"You want people to evaluate what's happening so there isn't a panic reaction 
to a news flash going over the wire," he said. 
But market analysts say that ever since PG&E and Edison stocks plummeted in 
early January, the governor's statements haven't significantly affected their 
performance. 
"There has been so much news that has been so negative for the companies that 
I don't think it makes much of a difference," said Ed Schuller, a senior vice 
president for the full-service brokerage firm Sutro & Co. "It's beyond that 
point now."

GOP Sees Power Crisis as Davis' Achilles' Heel
Republicans line up to run for governor 

Friday,?February 23, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, politically wounded by the state's power woes, 
has become the target of a growing pack of Republicans looking to turn him 
out of office. 
"Four months ago, Davis looked on track to get re-elected by a voice vote," 
said Dan Schnur, a GOP strategist. "But the energy crisis has exposed 
vulnerabilities that have encouraged others to look at the (2002 governor's) 
race." 
The governor's backers, however, are confident California voters will 
recognize Davis is dealing with a problem that has been brewing for years, 
through previous Republican administrations. 
"If the Republicans want to have a full-out firefight over who brought this 
(energy crisis) down, we're ready for it," said Garry South, the governor's 
top political adviser. "It's a fight they can't win." 
With the primary election still more than a year away, no one but Davis is a 
sure bet to leap into the contest, but at least three names will be 
circulating when California Republicans meet in Sacramento this weekend for 
their state convention. 
Secretary of State Bill Jones, Los Angeles investor Bill Simon Jr. and actor 
Arnold Schwarzenegger all have made noises about challenging Davis, but so 
far their incipient campaigns have been more talk than action. 
Simon's effort might be the farthest along, but he also has the longest way 
to travel. A political unknown, the 49-year-old Simon runs his family's 
investment company and has been active in a number of charitable 
organizations in Southern California. 
Simon, whose father was treasury secretary under President Richard Nixon, has 
brought in veteran GOP consultant Sal Russo to study a possible run for 
governor. 
"Bill Simon feels we need a governor who's prepared to lead and not one who's 
focused on fund-raising or the next political office," Russo said in a jab at 
Davis. 
Simon was an assistant U.S. attorney in New York, but founded William E. 
Simon & Sons with his brother and late father in 1988. The $2 billion private 
investment firm owns a number of companies and has also invested heavily in 
South of Market real estate in San Francisco. 
Wealthy political outsiders don't have an enviable record in recent 
California elections. Republican Michael Huffington spent $29 million to lose 
a 1994 Senate race to Dianne Feinstein. Darrell Issa dropped around $13 
million in a losing race for the 1998 GOP Senate nomination. Al Checchi spent 
about $38 million of his own money to lose the Democratic primary to Davis in 
1998. 
While Simon likely would be spending plenty of his own money on a governor's 
bid, he's working to get outside support, both political and financial, 
before committing to the race, Russo said. 
With the state's problems mounting and the economy increasingly shaky, the 
time may be ripe for a political unknown, he added. 
"When things start going bad, people are willing to look outside for a new 
face, someone who will get things done," Russo said. 
Jones is anything but a political outsider. A veteran legislator from the 
Fresno area, he is now serving his second and last term as California's 
secretary of state. He managed to hang onto his job during the GOP's 1998 
electoral debacle, which cost the party every other constitutional office. 
While Jones has long talked about a run for governor, he's still playing coy. 
"We have not made any decision and probably won't make one until early 
March," said Rob Lapsley, one of Jones' top advisers. "Right now we're 
putting together information for Bill to make a decision." 
While Jones' role as the state's top GOP officeholder makes him an obvious 
choice to challenge Davis, he's made a number of political enemies over the 
years, many of them in his own party. His surprise decision last year to 
switch his support from George W. Bush to Arizona Sen. John McCain in 
California's presidential primary won him no fans among Bush supporters and 
could hurt his attempts to raise money for a gubernatorial bid. 
Money is a major problem for Jones, who listed $118,000 in his campaign fund 
last month, compared with nearly $26 million for Davis. Some of his opponents 
have suggested that fund-raising woes may force Jones to run for an office 
other than governor. 
"Right now, we're focused on the governor's race," Lapsley insisted. 
The real Republican wild card is Schwarzenegger, the movie action hero who 
would be instantly recognized by nearly every California voter. 
While Schwarzenegger's publicist told The Chronicle last month that he had no 
plans to get involved in next year's governor's race, the Austrian-born star 
was on the telephone to a Los Angeles Times columnist days later, talking 
about his love for politics and his political ambitions. 
Fame, however, has its drawbacks, as the 53-year-old Schwarzenegger has 
found. An article in Premiere magazine entitled "Arnold the Barbarian" 
accused him of groping women on movie sets and generally boorish behavior, 
while the supermarket tabloids have him on the cover this week, suggesting 
that his marriage to Maria Shriver is on the rocks. 
South, Davis' political adviser, gleefully sent copies of the Premiere 
article to reporters across the state, suggesting that "the piece lays out a 
real 'touching' story -- if you get what I mean." 
Whoever ends up with the GOP nomination still will face an uphill battle 
against Davis, a popular governor and a "take no prisoners" campaigner. 
"I've been predicting since Day One that the GOP would find some moneybags 
candidate to throw against Gray," South said. "That's why we've kept our 
political and fund-raising operation going since election day."

Pressure Is on Utilities to Accept Grid Sale 

Energy: Gov. Davis wants accord today, but Edison executive says company 
might prefer bankruptcy. 

By DAN MORAIN and NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writers 

?????SACRAMENTO--His credibility at risk and California's energy future on 
the line, Gov. Gray Davis on Thursday turned up the heat on the state's 
utilities to accept today a series of tentative rescue accords that would put 
the companies' transmission systems into public hands.
?????How far the utilities are willing to bend to the governor's intensified 
pressure was unclear late Thursday. Given Davis' mandate, a top executive of 
Southern California Edison said his company is now being forced to seriously 
contemplate whether it might fare better in Bankruptcy Court.
?????"We are weighing two very unpalatable alternatives," he said.
?????Two alternatives facing the utilities are either to sell their 
electrical transmission systems to the state at a price they consider too low 
or gamble in Bankruptcy Court that they could hang onto their valuable assets.
?????After nearly a week of negotiations, Davis administration officials said 
they hoped to announce today a partial deal that would calm the utilities' 
jittery creditors and help subdue California's runaway electricity market.
?????State officials said Thursday they were close to agreements with Edison 
and San Diego Gas & Electric but remained at odds with the state's biggest 
utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, which has balked at giving up its 
transmission grid.
?????"These are complex issues that cannot be resolved overnight," said PG&E 
spokesman Ron Lowe. "There are clearly some areas where we are very far 
apart."
?????On Thursday, Edison Chairman John Bryson conferred with members of his 
utility's board of directors. But by evening, the company's top executives 
still had not decided whether to acknowledge that an agreement is near.
?????Although the utility has begun to contemplate the protections of 
bankruptcy, it is unclear when, or if, such a dramatic action would occur.
?????Davis is believed to be offering roughly $7 billion for the utilities' 
transmission grids. The companies could use the cash to restructure their 
debt, which resulted from the utilities' inability to pass along their 
soaring wholesale electricity costs to ratepayers.
?????Davis has significant political and fiscal reasons for wanting to make 
an announcement today. He is scheduled to arrive in Washington for the 
National Governor's Assn. conference this weekend, meet with U.S. Energy 
Secretary Spencer Abraham on Sunday, and attend the Democratic Governors 
Assn. annual fund-raising dinner Monday night.
?????Davis, a prodigious fund-raiser, is chairman of the Democratic Governors 
Assn., and the dinner is expected to raise more than $5 million. Of that 
amount, Davis' political organization raised in excess of $1 million, said 
Garry South, his chief political advisor.
?????Any progress Davis can cite could help improve his national political 
standing. But his aides say it's especially important to be able to show at 
least a semblance of an agreement when he travels to New York on Wednesday to 
confer with Wall Street analysts.
?????On Thursday, those analysts reacted exuberantly to early hints from the 
governor's office that settlements with the utilities might be announced.
?????The recently anemic stocks of Edison International and PG&E Corp. soared 
on the New York Stock Exchange on a day when most utility stocks closed lower.
?????Edison jumped $1.50 per share, or 11.15%, to close at $14.95 while PG&E 
gained $1.49, or 11.41%, to $14.55 per share.
?????"That suggests that someone thinks something good is happening in 
Sacramento," said analyst James D. von Riesemann of Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter & Co.
?????But some analysts fear investor enthusiasm might be hasty.
?????"I'm concerned that the governor's optimism may not coincide with all 
the parties at the table and it may not coincide with the Legislature," said 
Paul Patterson, utility analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston Corp.
?????Davis met Thursday with Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra, the parent 
company of SDG&E. Administration officials are confident that an agreement 
can be reached. But the San Diego company is the smallest of the state's 
three major private utilities, and its debt is far smaller--$605 million, 
compared to the combined $12.7 billion that Edison and PG&E say they have 
amassed.
?????"[Baum] is willing to listen," said Sempra spokesman Doug Kline. " . . . 
We're on the record as stating that we are willing to consider the sale of 
those [transmission] assets if it helps solve the crisis."
?????PG&E executives had been scheduled to start meeting with Davis at 11 
a.m. Thursday. But in what was seen a slight against PG&E, Davis' aides did 
not summon negotiators for the Northern California utility, including company 
Chairman Robert Glynn, until after 3:30.
?????Although the parties continued to wrangle over details, there was 
progress Thursday on the sidelines. 
?????State officials announced they had signed a long-term contract for a 
relatively small amount of electricity with a major energy supplier--an 
achievement that was perhaps more symbolic than substantive.
?????Tulsa-based Williams Cos. said it had agreed to a 10-year deal to sell 
power to the Department of Water Resources. By April, the company will 
provide at least 175 megawatts--enough electricity to supply 175,000 
homes--at times of the day when demand for electricity soars. Such peak 
supplies will increase through next summer and reach 900 megawatts by 2006, 
according to Williams.
?????The agreement is only the second such long-term contract since Davis 
signed a bill Feb. 1 putting the Department of Water Resources into the 
power-buying business for many years to come.
?????At least 10 other power suppliers have reached understandings with the 
state, Davis said Wednesday. But those companies refuse to sign deals, the 
governor said, until the state finds a way to help California's two biggest 
utilities pay off their billion-dollar debts.
?????"As soon as we revitalize the utilities," the governor said, "I think 
you'll see a lot of movement on long-term contracts."
?????Another small but important piece of the state's energy plan emerged 
Thursday when legislation was introduced by Sen. Jim Battin (R-La Quinta) to 
slash the rates paid to alternative energy producers--a move expected to 
shave $3 billion or more in annual costs charged to the big private 
utilities. Reducing the amount paid to producers of renewable energy such as 
solar, wind and biomass power is considered a crucial step in keeping 
expected consumer rate hikes down.
?????And, after 40 days of dangerously low electricity supplies, the state 
got a reprieve Thursday morning when grid officials lifted the state's 
"electrical emergency" status for the first time since Jan. 13.
?????So far, the state has spent nearly $2 billion buying electricity on 
behalf of the utilities, according to the Department of Finance, which 
informed the Legislature on Thursday that it will release another $500 
million for electricity purchases.

Energy Firms Won't Pay All of Monster Debt
PUC reverses, taxpayers could foot the bill 
Christian Berthelsen, Chronicle Staff Writer
Friday,?February 23, 2001 

 Under a ruling yesterday by state regulators, California taxpayers could be 
on the hook for hundreds of   millions of dollars in power purchases the 
state has made in behalf of two troubled utilities. 
The California Public Utilities Commission voted unanimously to absolve 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison of responsibility 
for any costs above the revenue they collect from ratepayers. 
The ruling reversed a position taken earlier by the commission, which had 
said the utilities were responsible for making up the difference between the 
state's costs and their own revenue. 
John Tremaine, a PG&E spokesman, said the funding needed to make up the 
difference could come in the form of a surcharge imposed on customers who use 
130 percent of the baseline amount of electricity. That is one option under a 
bill passed last month by the Legislature, he said. 
But Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said the governor does 
not believe the money will come from ratepayers' electric bills. The costs, 
Maviglio said, could be covered by the $10 billion bond measure the state 
recently issued to cover power purchases. 
As California tries to resolve its power crisis, state officials are working 
out the precise way that should be done. 
Under the state's deregulation plan approved in 1996, the utilities have been 
forced to absorb skyrocketing wholesale electricity costs while being 
prevented by law from passing the increases on to customers through higher 
rates. 
Since the California Department of Water Resources began buying power last 
month, details showing how it will be repaid, how much or by whom have not 
been established. 
Yesterday's PUC decision was an attempt to begin setting the repayment 
criteria. 
A precise accounting of how much money is at stake is impossible to determine 
at this point, officials said, because PG&E declines to release ratepayer 
revenue figures, and the state is refusing to say exactly how much it has 
spent buying power. Officials estimate the state will spend $2.3 billion by 
the beginning of March and Davis authorized the expenditure of $500 million 
more yesterday. 
The state's Department of Water Resources became the buyer of record on Jan. 
17 when the two utilities' credit was so damaged that they were no longer 
able to buy power. 
Both utilities had opposed the commission's previous position that they be 
responsible for all power costs. 
The PUC's shift yesterday was summed up by Commissioner Richard Bilas, who 
said he could not support holding the utilities responsible for the revenue 
shortfall. "The DWR is not about to go bankrupt; the utilities are," he said. 
Yet consumer advocates downplayed the commission's ruling yesterday. Nettie 
Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network, said the ruling only 
dealt with the narrow issue of who has to account for the revenue shortfall, 
and did not reach an overarching decision about who, ultimately, will be 
financially responsible for it. 
"This is not a huge deal," she said. 
The state has been buying the lion's share of its power in the real-time 
market run by the Independent System Operator since the demise of the longer- 
term California Power Exchange, said Jesus Arredondo, a spokesman for the 
exchange. 
The state has been paying premium prices because it is buying in a market 
that was designed to handle last-minute emergencies. 
The governor's office has been seeking cheaper, long-term power contracts 
with only modest results.

Small electric producers OK big price cut

By Ed Mendel 
STAFF WRITER 
February 23, 2001 

SACRAMENTO -- Legislators said yesterday that small generators who produce 
about 30 percent of the state's power have agreed to cut their power prices 
in half, an important step toward easing the electricity crisis. 
Negotiations continued on what Gov. Gray Davis has called the final step: the 
state purchase of the transmission systems of the three investor-owned 
utilities in exchange for paying off their huge debt. 
Meanwhile, the amount that the state is spending to buy power for the 
customers of the utilities grows. Officials gave notice that an additional 
$500 million will be needed in 10 days, bringing the total to $2.6 billion. 
But for the first time in nearly six weeks the state did not declare an alert 
yesterday due to power shortages. More power was available from other states, 
and some power plants that had been shut down for maintenance resumed 
operation. 
Two legislators, Sen. Jim Battin, R-Palm Desert, and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, 
D-Boulder Creek, said they introduced legislation that sharply reduces the 
prices paid to small generators after weeks of difficult negotiations. 
"Ultimately, this bill will reduce the cost of energy to the state and its 
ratepayers by billions of dollars," said Battin, who represents eastern San 
Diego County. 
About half of the small generators use "renewable" technologies such as 
solar, wind, geothermal and biomass. The rest is "co-generation," when fuel 
is used for industrial purposes and electricity is generated as a by-product. 
The small generators have grown to produce nearly a third of California's 
power under a two-decade-old federal "qualifying facilities" program, which 
requires utilities to buy their power. 
Battin and Keeley said that under the bill, SB 47X, the average price for 
these QF contracts could drop from the current 17 cents per kilowatt-hour to 
about 8 to 8.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. 
"We believe that the rates are at least that low, if not lower," said Jan 
Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, which 
represents small and large generators. 
The small generators support the bill because it will give them a stable 
price for five years, avoiding ups and downs and the possibility that state 
regulators might make a more unfavorable price cut. 
Much of the current price formula is based on the price of natural gas at the 
California border, which has soared this winter. The legislation spreads the 
price bench mark over a five-year period. 
"We encourage the Legislature to take quick action to approve SB 47X as 
quickly as possible to help stabilize the electricity crisis," Smutny-Jones 
said. 
He said one of the side agreements to the legislation is the creation of a 
portfolio of long-term contracts to purchase natural gas for some 
co-generators, lowering their production costs. 
The legislation was applauded as "a major step forward" by a group of small 
generators who formed a creditors committee last week and threatened to take 
the utilities into bankruptcy. 
"We call on the Legislature and the governor to act on it immediately," said 
Chris Thompson, a spokesman for the group. 
Thompson said Southern California Edison continues to collect money from 
ratepayers, as the state buys power for its customers, but is not paying 
anything to the small non-polluting generators. 
A spokesman for a geothermal generator in El Centro, which filed a lawsuit 
seeking $45 million from Edison for power provided since November, welcomed 
the legislation for giving generators stability and ratepayers cheaper power. 
But Vince Signorotti, a spokesman for CalEnergy, said it would be "premature" 
to consider dropping the lawsuit. 
Battin and Keeley said that payment of the small generators depends on the 
governor's attempt to negotiate the purchase of the transmission systems of 
Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric, and San Diego Gas and Electric in exchange 
for payment of their debt. 
As part of the governor's plan, the utilities would agree to provide low-cost 
power for five to 10 years from their generators, which provide about a third 
of the state's power. 
Davis aides are attempting to negotiate long-term contracts with generators 
for the remaining third of the power required by the state, sharply reducing 
the cost of buying power on the expensive spot market. 
But the governor said this week that many generators are reluctant to sign 
long-term contracts until they know how the utilities will pay their debt for 
previous power purchases. 
The state called off all power alerts yesterday for the first time since 
mid-January, rescinding a Stage 1 alert declared Wednesday. Grid operators 
made the change after increased power supplies became available. 
"The supply situation this week has gradually been improving," said Lorie 
O'Donley, a spokeswoman with the California Independent System Operator, 
which manages most of the state's power supplies. 
However, she said the improvements shouldn't deter consumers from 
conservation. 
"It is good news to be out of electrical emergencies but we just want to 
remind everybody that we are looking at a long-term power supply situation 
here," she said. "And the high-demand summer is just around the corner. So we 
would ask that people continue with their conservation efforts." 
In San Francisco yesterday, state power regulators decided unanimously that 
the Department of Water Resources is responsible for buying any power that 
cash-strapped utilities are unable to generate or buy on their own -- no 
matter what price wholesalers are charging. 
But the PUC voted 3-2 against taking action that would have allowed the DWR 
to receive a portion of ratepayer revenues from the utilities to help cover 
the cost of buying electricity. 
The state, through the DWR, was authorized by a recent law to buy power for 
the utilities. Edison and PG&E have such low credit ratings that no power 
companies will sell to them. SDG&E's rating is much better, but its debt also 
was mounting. 
The DWR purchases that portion of electricity beyond what the utilities 
provide through their own generating plants and through existing long-term 
contracts. But the DWR has refused to buy power beyond a certain price. That 
means more last-minute power purchases on the expensive spot market. 
The utilities and the state had disagreed over how the DWR will be reimbursed 
-- whether through state bonds or ratepayer dollars -- and the extent of its 
power-buying role. 
The author of the bill authorizing the long-term contracts, Assemblyman 
Keeley, said the legislation's intent was to fully cover the one-third of the 
power that utilities purchased on the spot market, either through extended 
contracts or through the state ISO.
Staff writer Karen Kucher and The Associated Press contributed to this 
report.

Today, I spoke with EPSA's outside counsel, Andy Zausner, about having his 
firm's Senior Counsel former Senator Wendell Ford (D-Ky, 1974-98) assist us 
with our FERC "Linda Breathitt" Strategy.  Former Senator Ford knew Linda's 
father well plus has dinner with Linda every several weeks or so.  There 
probably isn't anyone in Washington closer to Linda than Wendell as he has 
known her since she was a child.  Andy is expecting either Steve's or Rick's 
phone call to further discuss the Senator's involvement.  Andy did discuss in 
general that he wasn't certain whether his client, EPSA, would go along with 
the strategy but he thought, overall, it was a possibility.  Andy's direct 
number is 202-828-2259.  I know Andy and Wendell very well and would like to 
be helpful as you wish.  However, at this point, I thought an EPSA board 
member (i.e. Steve or Rick) should follow up.  thanks.

Mark and Steve, sorry to bother you with this, but I'm at a loss.  This guy 
(Jim Cofield) called me on my cell phone last night about 7:00 p.m. to get my 
e-mail address.  He asked that I take a look at his e-mail in the morning and 
route it to the appropriate person within Enron.  

The ".jpg" files below have no information in them, but the ".doc" file is a 
14 page document with numerous correspondence from Mary Beth Cahill, former 
director in the White House Office for Public Liaison, to Mr. Cofield 
regarding a trip to Nigeria that he supposedly accompanied President Clinton 
on several months ago; followed by a number of "proprietary information 
documents" that mean absolutely nothing to me; followed by an overview of 
Nigeria's electrical power situation; etc....The best I can tell, they are 
trying to get Enron to bid on some project in Nigeria.

Since this e-mail is copied to the Vice President of the United States in 
addition to several ambassadors, I thought it might need attention.  If you 
can figure it out, please let me know how to proceed.  Thanks, SRS

Dear Steve:   Last month while at my reunion at the Fletcher School of Law 
and Diplomacy
at Tufts University, some of the school officials told me that Enron has 
hired about eight 
Fletcher graduates recently and is happy with them.   The school is also 
happy and wants
to strengthen its relationship with Enron.   They had earlier this year 
contacted a Laura 
Kalmans, Director of Community Development at Enron, to discuss various ideas 
for cooperation 
with Enron that would strengthen our capacity in environmental matters and 
give the students
exposure to real world issues, but nothing happened and they lost contact.  

They asked me who they should contact to find out how to pursue this and I 
said 
I thought it might be you or someone under you.    They now want to send a 
letter
to someone at Enron on this proposal.  It is OK if it is addressed to you or 
should I tell
them another name?   Please advise me how to steer them in the right 
direction.    

Many thanks.  David Merrill

Dear Ambassador Merrill,

I understand that you and Betsy Ginsberg had a conversation at reunion last 
month about a possible
partnership between the Fletcher School and Enron.  Thank you for generously 
offering to help us
explore this connection.  We believe there are strong synergies between 
Professor Bill Moomaw's
International Environment and Resource Policy program and Enron's business 
model.  There is
currently a strong recruiting relationship between Enron and Fletcher; there 
are nine Fletcherites
at Enron at this time.  I'm confident that our strong recruiting relationship 
is a solid first step
from which to launch an even stronger partnership.

In order to explore expanding this relationship Ms. Elise Kalmans, Director 
of Community
Development, agreed to arrange a meeting for Bill and me last spring.  
Unfortunately, the scheduling
did not work out, and Ms. Kalmans then began a maternity leave so we had 
trouble identifying a new
point of contact.

I appreciate your suggestion that we aim to work through Stephen Kean.  As 
Senior Vice President for
Public and Environmental and Government Affairs, he does sound like the ideal 
contact with whom to
discuss Professor Moomaw's program and its students. How do you suggest we 
proceed?  Should we send
a letter from Interim Dean Trachtman to ask if Mr. Kean would be willing to 
meet with Professor
Moomaw?  May I mention that you suggested we write him?

At Betsy's suggestion, I have attached the presentation outline we prepared 
for Enron, along with
the letter we originally mailed to Elise.  I would be very interested in any 
suggestions you may
have.  If you have any trouble opening the powerpoint file or word document, 
please let me know and
I would be happy to mail or fax them.  Thank you again for your kind offer of 
assistance.

Sincerely,

		 Subject: Pipeline safety legislation - update

Since the defeat of the Senate pipeline safety legislation earlier this week 
in the House, we have been working on strategies related to action that could 
occur before the end of the congressional session.  The following 
developments indicate that the legislation is still very much in play, but 
our primary concerns are making sure efforts going forward remain under 
control and preventing the passage of legislation that goes too far.

Developments:

House Republican leadership is not interested in pursuing the legislation any 
further, either through regular procedures or as an attachment to 
appropriations, "omnibus" or other must-pass measures.   They are somewhat 
angry at the industry for not being able to fight off advances made by Reps. 
Dingell and Oberstar, who were able to persuade enough Democrats to vote 
against the Senate bill so that it fell short of the 2/3 needed for passage 
under suspension of the rules.

Senate bill sponsors/supporters are extremely angry at House Democrats for 
killing the Senate legislation, and at the White House/DOT for not strongly 
promoting the Senate bill (which they previously had supported) and reigning 
in House Democrats.   Senator Patty Murray called the White House and 
expressed her concern, which prompted a series of meetings between staff for 
Senate and House Democrats and the White House to discuss a solution.   

In these meetings, House Democrats have proposed adding several provisions 
from the Dingell/Oberstar legislation to the Senate bill and moving that 
package on an omnibus or appropriations bill.   Sources close to Rep. Dingell 
indicate that they really do not want any bill at all, and are merely keeping 
up the pressure in an effort to see if they can get the Senate or industry to 
accept tougher provisions.

Senate Democrats (including Murray, Bingaman, and Breaux) are not accepting 
any possible amendments to the original Senate bill, and are opposed to 
changing the Senate bill at all.   However, Senator Murray and Republican 
Senator Slade Gorton (who has a tough election) both want to continue to 
pursue the Senate bill (unamended) as a rider to an omnibus/appropriations 
bill.    

The White House is looking to cover itself from a poor performance in the 
House, and is considering drafting an executive order that could be issued if 
no legislation passes at all.  It is unclear what could or would be contained 
in such an order, but the White House is indicating to Senate staff that it 
would be more like the Senate bill than the House bill.  We are working with 
sources close to the White House to confirm their strategy.

Strategy going forward:

Upon hearing that some industry associations were on Capitol Hill discussing 
"what industry could live with" in terms of provisions added to the Senate 
bill, I insisted (along with El Paso and others) that we not take such an 
approach, but rather remain consistent in our approach -- we support the 
Senate bill and only the Senate bill.   It was approved unanimously in the 
Senate and by 60% of the House, and if anything moves forward on an 
omnibus/appropriations bill, it should be the Senate bill.  Consistent with 
what our Senate friends are doing, we should not even recognize the 
Dingell/Oberstar legislation as a serious proposal, nor start accepting 
pieces of it as a compromise.

We will be shoring up support for our position of "if anything moves forward, 
it should be the Senate bill only" with Senate supporters and leadership in 
the House and Senate.  We will also be working to thank the 51 Democrats who 
supported us in the House, and make sure they have any cover they need in 
case their vote becomes an issue.   In support of Senator Gorton's election 
troubles, we will be working to try to get media placement of op-eds that 
support the efforts he has waged and make sure the House Democrats shoulder 
the blame for the bill's defeat.  In particular, we are hopeful that Senator 
McCain (who has been passionate about this issue) will write op-eds that can 
be placed to support Gorton and others in tough races who supported the 
Senate bill.

Congress' state of confusion over omnibus/appropriations bills and last 
minute politics causes the legislative activity to be extremely fluid and 
subject to change rapidly, so we will have no real certainty until the 
session is over (which now could be as late as October 20).  

I will keep you posted as changes and developments occur.

Jeff

Subject: California Power Issues Database

We have developed an intranet site/database for information tracking purposes 
for the California Power Issue. The intranet site will be placed on the 
home.enron.com webpage by Tuesday morning for all Enron employees to access. 
However, today, this comprehensive database is available to you for your 
California Power Issue needs. 

The database has been populated with the latest information that I have 
received concerning this topic and has been broken down in three categories:
California Power Issues, National Power Issues and Secured Documents. It has 
then been broken down further into subcategories.

The secured documents sections will only be accessible to those that are 
receiving this e-mail. Please let me know if you believe others should have 
access to this information. The secured document section contains all the 
information that I have received that Luntz Consulting has helped us develop, 
i.e. principals, statements, speeches and facts, as well as, talking points 
and other statements developed internally. These documents can be easily 
switched to open access to all Enron employees if you believe that these 
documents should not be restricted.

To access the intranet site you must be logged on to the network and then go 
to this link:  http://nahou-lndev02d.corp.enron.com/GovtAffa.nsf  (It is best 
if you copy this link and paste it in your internet Explorer or Netscape 
browser.)

Once you are at this site you will  be able to access all articles and 
information that I have collected/received concerning the California Power 
Issue. You can navigate the site by using the links on the left hand side of 
the screen. While navigating this site, keep in mind that the actual 
interface will be changed before we go live on Tuesday morning. 

To access the secured documents, click on secured documents and type in your 
user name, which is the same as if you are logging onto the network, and then 
type in your password, which is the same as if you are logging onto the 
network. However, if you have difficulties entering this site, you will need 
to change your Lotus internet password. Which is very simple to do and which 
you will need to do regardless if you decide to use this site or not, it is 
all part of the current computer migration. To change your internet password, 
go to this link  and then hit the edit person key. Go to the last field that 
says internet password and type in whatever password you would like, 
preferably your current network login password. (In the internet password 
section you will see a bunch of numbers and letters, delete those and enter 
your new network password.) 

There are still some bugs that will be worked out by Tuesday, but I thought 
since this is such a fast moving issue it was best to get this tool out so it 
could be used when needed. If you have any questions, please call me at 
713-853-4382.

Thanks,

Gavin

Here are some thoughts for Enron to share with at the Analyst meeting.  
Please let me know if you have any additions, changes, or deletions.  What I 
tried to put down were the key facts and positions.  If I've missed anything 
let me know.  This is not a great story.

Jim

OUR PHYSICAL POSITION IN CALIFORNIA

EES has electricity customers within the territories of SCE, PG&E, and SDG&E 
(about 800 MW of usage) [NOTE - CHECK WITH EES].  EES has natural gas 
customers within the territories PG&E and SoCal Gas.

Enron does not have any generation in California (we own a small QF in Nevada 
but only have 50 MW excess).  

We supply power to the Utilities and to our retail load by buying excess in 
California or by transmitting power into the state.  Enron sells natural gas 
to the LDCs mainly under spot arrangements.

Enron continues to manage the risk by using traditional hedging tools and by 
using the full complement of resources of EES - demand reduction, load 
shaping, and efficiency improvements.

Transwestern has long-term capacity arrangements with PG&E.

OUR POLITICAL POSITION IN CALIFORNIA / MESSAGES

The current situation (shortages and potential bankruptcy) is not the result 
of competitive markets, rather it is the result of barriers to workable 
retail and wholesale markets designed into the California deregulation model 
(for instance, the overreliance of the Utilities on the spot market, the 
residual CTC calculation, incomplete retail tariff unbundling requiring 
direct access customers to pay more than their fair share for the Utilities' 
common costs). 

Enron does not want to see the California Utilities go bankrupt because those 
naysayers of competition will use this situation as an argument against 
competition.  Enron disagrees.  What it proves is that not finishing the job 
of creating real competition can result in problems.  

Enron believes that there are workable short-term and long-term solutions for 
California.

In the short-term, (1) California must provide credit enhancement or directly 
buy power for the Utilities' needs to ensure a stable supply of electricity, 
(2) California should incent customers to institute demand reductions, and 
(3) California should raise rates to cover reasonable costs so that the 
Utilities do not petition for bankruptcy.

In the long-term, (1) California needs to continue its activities to promote 
retail competition (and most importantly it must allow real price signals to 
be sent to large customers), (2) California should implement the changes that 
the FERC highlighted (end the reliance on the spot market, remove 
stakeholders on the Cal ISO Board, give the Utilties the ability to recover 
wholesale power costs), (3) California must remove unnecessary barriers to 
the development of additional generation capacity, and, most importantly, (4) 
California must establish reasonable structures so that the Utilities develop 
a balanced portfolio of supplies to better manage electricity market 
volatility.

California should not get into the business of owning or operating generation 
assets or transmission facilities.  

California should not stop moving forward with retail competitition which 
allows customers to manage price risk rather than some regulator.

KEY ENRON ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA

We do have outstanding deliveries into the California utilities and would be 
an unsecured creditor if bankruptcy occurs. We continue to sell to 
creditworthy counterparties in Western Power markets. [NOTE - THE AMOUNT OF 
RISK IS AN IR ISSUE THEY WANT TO MANAGE].

The PX Credit (and associated negative CTC) continues to be an issue.  Enron 
believes that the rate freeze has not yet ended legally and PG&E's and SCE's 
tariff requires the Utilities to pay funds to the customer's agent.  We filed 
a Complaint Friday January 19 at the CPUC.  We are confident that these funds 
will be recovered.  [NOTE - I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THIS - AGAIN 
AN IR ISSUE BECAUSE OF THE RECEIVABLE]

Cindy and Steve:  Please see Kathy Mayfield's split responsibility proposal.  
She initially discussed it with Jean Ryall at the beginning of January just 
prior to the start of the legislative session.  Unfortunately, Jean has not 
responded to Kathy's numerous inquiries.  As you can see, Community Relations 
can use Kathy for United Way, but that will account for only 40% of her time, 
with 60% designated for legislative/economic development activities under 
Jean.  Please let me know your thoughts on how to proceed.  I am nervous 
about a full-time role for Kathy should Jean not be interested in supporting 
these activities and want to make sure that her talents are optimized for 
Enron.

I spoke with TJ today and he indicated that he is interested in talking with 
Enron ; however , he and his spouse were taking off for a five week break 
between jobs ( he said he had told Ken of his plans ). That he would like to 
set something up in late March upon his return. I will call him and set  up a 
date with him. We have a good lead time to get on the G9 calendars.

I will keep you updated.

I got the package on the 2002 PBS special.  We are already doing a 
significant PBS sponsorship in connection with a series based on Dan Yergin's 
(author of The Prize) new book "The Commanding Heights".  We have looked at 
numerous Public Broadcasting sponsorships in the past, but the ratings are so 
low they tend to be a very inefficient means of reaching our target 
audience.  We made an exception for yergin's series because it focusses on 
the role of free markets and their relationship with governments over time.

Thanks for taking the time to discuss the Enron Advisory Council today.  I 
think the second topic you mentioned "Escaping the Inherent Limits of 
Success" would be a great discussion starter.  I'll add it to the agenda and 
look forward to seeing you there.

I don't see anything technically wrong with the document, but I struggle to 
see the point of it.  Most people are not going to care about our industry's 
problem; they are going to be interested in solutions.  We should be telling 
them what the answer is -- eg forward prices are lower; there is an 
opportunity to buy forward now and protect yourself from volatility; etc.  
What do you think?

Can you please review?  We'd like to send as an informational

and not expected to drop anytime soon.  We're using this letter

These are good fixes.  I still think it's important for our security people 
to be able to recognize all of our senior executives and make sure their 
guests get where they are going quickly.

Follow-up

Steve - 

Following up on our conversation Friday, we have advised Cliff Baxter's 
Assistant that effective immediately Cliff and his quests can pass through 
Security on the Plaza, without showing his access card or requiring his 
quests to sign in or identify themselves.  All he needs to do is approach the 
front Reception Desks and asking for entry.  The receptionists will recognise 
Cliff by sight and ensure that he and his quests pass through - without delay 
- by lifting the adjacent rope.

We are asking Cliff to use his badge at the card readers, as per standard 
procedure, when he is entering the building by himself.

We are also refining procedures and upgrading our IT systems/data base @ the 
Reception Desk, to make it easier on a visitor of any employee.  For example 
if you call down to the Plaza Reception Desk and advise that a visitor is 
expected, the receptionist will have a pass prepared so as to eliminate the 
sign in process.  The guest simply has to exchange their business card for 
the visitor pass.  Or if an employee shows their access card at the Reception 
Desk and asks that their guest gain entry, that guest can get a badge without 
signing in.  Again, we ask that the guest exchange their business card for a 
visitor pass.

We are  working on installing a new data base @ the Desk that will pull up a 
digitised photo of the employee (duplicate of what's on their badge) on the 
screen.  This will allow employees to get a temporary access badge without 
showing other ID and will speed process.

Finally, we are testing a small proximity access card which is designed to be 
a duplicate back-up for executives.  It is sized to fit on a key chain and 
works with our standard card readers.

- Bill

I will be on the first panel of the FERC California conference on Thursday.  
The format allows a 5 min presentation and then 60 min of Q&A.  I need your 
help to make sure I have "Gore-like" command of the details.  Please help 
with the following information:
Enron project information (Parquet/McCubbin) -- please give me any 
presentations or summaries you have on the generation, or firm purchases, we 
have under way (or planned).  I'll talk with you to find out what we are 
comfortable disclosing but please err on the side of giving whatever 
information you have.
Updated Belden presentation (Hain/Belden) -- I believe the latest information 
was as of August; I think some of the information on the cost of peaking 
facilities is particularly eye-opening on the price cap issue.
Comparison to PJM (Hartsoe/Novosel) -- Is the information we are seeking from 
the ISO and PX similar to information PJM already provides?  If so, it would 
be nice to tie our requests back to something the Commission has already 
approved.
Cancelled DSM projects (Mahoney) -- Again, I'll only use what we feel 
comfortable with, but it would help make our point if we can give examples of 
how price caps backfire when it comes to encouraging conservation.
ISO/PX reports (Dasovich).  I have the ISO market surveillance report.  Is 
there another ISO report?  If so, please get me a copy and provide a copy of 
the PX report too.
CEC/Proposed generation update (Mara/Parquet) -- Need the basic information: 
proposed, waiting for permitting; how much/little the legislation did to 
expedite siting (ie are we still comfortable saying that it applies to less 
than 10%)?
Soft cap(Belden/Hain) -- need a crisp explanation of why the "soft" nature of 
the cap is not sufficient.  Also, would we be OK if the Commission revised it 
to say that bids can be taken above 150 without special filing or reporting 
requirements, but those bids will be accepted at the price bid rather than 
applying to all lower bids as well (ie the highest bid at or below 150 clears 
the market, bids above 150 accepted at price bid as needed)?
Offers we have made/deals done (Parquet/Dasovich/ Mccubbin) -- Roseville plus 
any others, offer made to SDG&E -- I want to make the point that the market 
will provide solutions (below the retail price cap) if we get the utility 
(and the regulators) out of the merchant function.
Herding the cats(Hartsoe/mccubbin/mara/dasovich):  We are asking FERC to be 
courageous, do the right thing and ignore the politics.  To be even halfway 
credible, we can't have IEP, EPSA, Dynegy or anyone else "squishing" on the 
price cap issue..  We have never been closer to reform in California, we need 
these guys on board.
Thanks.

Please provide me an update on the progress of the working group you have led 
this year.  There are several things I would like you to cover in this regard.

Did the working group function through the year or was it terminated (I 
recognize there may be good reasons for the latter, but would like to 
understand those reasons).

What did the group accomplish?

Would you recommend continuing it?   Any changes?

Are there other topics we should consider for working groups in the future?  
Any changes to the working group process itself?

Please provide input on the individuals you worked with.  You should be able 
to do this through the PEP system.  If you cannot, please provide the 
feedback by confidential e-mail to me.  Because the PRC is coming up soon, 
please provide the feedback by December 1.

Subject: Weekly Notes

Steve - 

I will be taking this Friday, the 18th, off on vacation.  Here are notes for 
your staff meeting.

Buyer/Seller have executed Offer Letter on Falcon EX ($32,750,000 price).  
Aircraft goes to pre-purchase inspection this weekend.  Close is no later 
than June 6th.  All indications are that buyer is very motivated to complete 
the deal.
Enron Center South (ECS) Project remains solidly on track.  We are 10 weeks 
out on initial occupancy with Level 3 occupancy (EGM moves Aug. 3rd).  Levels 
4 (EIM, ENW, & Credit.Com) occupies two weeks later (Aug. 17).  Level 5 
(Power) occupies two weeks after (Aug. 31st  - Labor Day weekend).  Level 6 
(Gas) occupies two weeks after (Sept. 14th).  Level 7 (Executive) and the 1st 
floor public spaces occupies year end.  Level 2 (Cafeteria) opens Nov.
Found a Law firm interested in Azurix's present space in Three Allen Center 
(3 floors).  Goal is cut deal and have them in by year end.
Enron Broadband indicates an intent to remain on their present ECN floors 
(Levels 44 and 45), plus backfill balance of operations into Wholesale's 
vacated trading floors.  This splits them into two elevator banks and becomes 
problematic for ETS - who wants continuous floors, ECN Levels 39 through 46.
We are seeking subtenants for Broadband's Portland office space.  They plan 
to vacate the Riverplace building by Oct. 
Negotiating new food service contract with Sedexo Marriott to add ECS 
cafeteria.  Total compensation will be based on 3% fee on gross revenue - 
only on individual sales of $2 or more (promote greater # of meals served) 
and bonus based on sharing of net operating income with Enron.  Global 
Sourcing is participating with us in negotiations.
Need to decide if Executive Car Care program is going to be continued (30 
executives participate with employee paying $70 per month and business units 
subsidizing $275 per month).  Decision needed because new Garage will require 
$60K in improvements to get set up for car washing.  Present lease on remote 
car washing facility (@ $5k per month) expired and we are on month to month 
holdover.
We are two weeks out to close on Beltway 8 land deal ($1.7 purchase price).  
Real estate being acquired for construction of new $18 mill. Data Center and 
Disaster Recovery Facility.  Phillipe and I meet with Frevert next week to 
get approvals.

- Bill

Subject: CFTC Reauthorization

At his request, I met Lee Sachs, Assistant Treasury Secretary, who had 
requested the meeting after a brief conversation recently.  Lee said that 
senior-level negotiations led by Secretary Summers were initiated last week 
between the CFTC and SEC and that progress was being made on the single stock 
futures issue (the major issue postponing movement of the legislation).  

As you know, the House completed committee work on HR 4541 before it 
recessed.  The bill will now is pending before the Rules Committee where 
differences will be worked out between the three different Committee versions 
(Agriculture, Commerce, and Banking).  The Senate Agriculture Committee 
passed out the Senate version in July.  However, the bill is not moving 
quickly in the Senate due to Senator Phil Gramm's desire to see significant 
changes made to the legislation (not directly related to our energy 
language). Last week at the Republican Convention, I asked the Senator about 
the bill and he said they were working on it, but much needs to be changed 
for his support.  More telling perhaps, were Wendy Gramm's comments that she 
would rather the current bill die if a better bill can be passed next year.  
What this means is that we must, at the least, remove Senator Gramm's 
opposition to the bill to move the process and more importantly seek to gain 
his support of the legislation.

Lee Sachs message was just that.  I told Lee that we shared his desire to 
move the legislation as long as it contains a full exclusion for all 
non-agriculture commodities (including metals).  He said that we would have a 
difficult time defending the metals provision politically. But, Lee said  "we 
would not find Treasury opposition to the House Commerce Committee language" 
(which includes favourable language on energy and metals).   This is a 
positive development, because it isolates the CFTC from its key defenders and 
I hope ensures no veto threat on our issues.  However, I do not expect 
Treasury to be vocal in support of our position.  It is clear that 
Congressional leaders and the Administration want to get this bill done this 
year and there remains a good opportunity for enactment.

However, with less than 20 or so legislative days left, we need Senator Gramm 
to engage.  A call from Ken Lay in the next two weeks to Senator Gramm could 
be an impetus for Gramm to move his staff to resolve the differences.  Gramm 
needs to fully understand how helpful the bill is to Enron.  Let me know your 
thoughts on this approach.   I am prepared to assist in coordinating the call 
and drafting the talking points for a Ken Lay/Sen. Gramm call.

Dear Ms. Williamson:

    Per an autoresponder from Yorleni Mendez, I am forwarding to you
what I sent to Enron & others a couple of days ago, which was in
supplement to what I sent on Feb. 6th.  Time is of the essence and not
on your side.  Nor are the facts & the law on your side.  Therefore, you
need to find a way to get us to be on your side.

    Due to the urgency and foreseeable and announced forthcoming event
horizons, I believe you may wish to provide copies of the attached to
the proper persons at Enron for their immediate attention.  Please let
them know that if I have to continue to give information & documents to
the U.S. Senate and the proper others, that I will do so and then also
show that the failure of Hughes interests/companies to take remedial
measures was indeed blatant refusal.  We have already logged where
Hughes companies/interests have been to
http://willgriffin.com/hughes.htm thus you might as well continue to
visit there and see where we have posted changes and new information.
The knowledge of the Hughes companies/interests of these matters is now
clearly established.  We've already submitted some of our visitor logs
and other documents to the proper others, establishing the knowledge of
Hughes companies/interests to others.  This is something I am sure will
be most meaningful to the lawyers, along with a few other things I'm
sure which will get their attention..

    Also please have someone forward the attached to William Rice
Lummis, James A. Baker and others and advise them that surprises,
attention getters & wake-up calls are just around the corner.  They need
to contact us soon, before it becomes improper to discuss how a
reasonable (fanny & facing-saving) resolve for Hughes
interests/companies may be achieved.

Subject: Advisory of Your Legal/Political Exposures Coming True
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="------------C4135F3BD40002931C95C2CA"

Dear Hughes Electronics, Enron, HHMI, and Hughes Lawyers, et. al:

    I am fully aware how many of the Hughes interests visited
http://willgriffin.com/hughes.htm after I sent you an e-mail on Feb. 6,
2001, advising you of your impending difficulties and exposures.

    I have made some changes to these Hughes related pages, including
posting my advisory to you to http://willgriffin.com/letterto.htm for
your convenience and reference, with active e-mail links to you and each
other.

    Also since I contacted you last week (the next day), Enron has been
in the news as being the biggest beneficiary of the California energy
woes, while also being the largest contributor, fund-raiser and general
benefactor to President George W. Bush.
http://www0.mercurycenter.com:80/premium/business/docs/enron07.htm
Another article goes even further showing the relationship of James
Addison Baker III to Enron and Hughes "Bush's Biggest Donors Gain From
High Prices in California Crunch"
http://www.villagevoice.com:80/issues/0106/ridgeway3.shtml

    You may wish to re-visit the updated
http://willgriffin.com/hughes.htm (refesh/reload the page to clear your
browser's cache of the previous copy) after reviewing the news articles
links about Enron provided above.  You should know and reasonably
foresee that you are not the only visitors to my Hughes pages.  You
should also know that I've had contact with the proper authorities and
this to include correspondences within this past week.  Then again, I'm
sure many in the pipeline of those who review this and my previous
advisory know this to be true, or to reasonably foresee the interest of
many others at a minimum.

    I believe you to foresee more to soon become public difficulties for
you and that the intensity will no doubt increase significantly.  You
should know that any political related problems will include Democrats
in volumes, but there exists quite a few Republicans who will disavow
and distance themselves from you.  The China-Hughes missile & satellite
technology transfers, that were cited in the Cox Committee report, and
the arming of Sadaam Hussein with Hughes technologies issues are about
to pop up their heads and see a longer shadow than the groundhog
recently did.  This, in addition to the recent articles about Enron,
current activities and forthcoming event horizons, is not good news for
Hughes interests.

    You just might want to ask William Rice Lummis and James A. Baker
III, et. al. how they intend to solicit the help of the guy who holds
the keys to resolve, who they've got a little miffed at them, because of
what was done to him in an ad hominem attempt.  Certainly, when it is
true that if he now does nothing and a profound correlation exists
between how bad things go for you and how good things go as a result for
him, then why should he help y'all?  It appears if you ask Mr. Baker
about the Matter of Hughes and how we hold the keys to an amiable
resolve, that he will stipulate that it will take some real "Politics of
Diplomacy" to persuade us to help you, but that this needs to be
urgently accomplished.

Please ask Ken to sign the following.  But, in the Advisory Council letter 
delete the reference to the December Board meeting and check with Ken on 
whether he still plans to brief the Enron Board at the December meeting (I 
believe he talked to Kelly Kimberly about this).

26th - I'm not sure Steve will be back from an offsite.

Steve is open March 27th and 28th.  

He will probably be out of town on the 29th and 30th.

It might be a good idea to have a conference call to discuss the state

agree that a call would be useful, does Noon PST (on Monday) work?

Jeff

you to speak anyway.  Any interest?

Dear Pankaj, 

I enjoyed meeting you last week in BA.? Steve Reifenberg and I are both 
grateful for your willingness to speak to Ken Lay at Enron on our behalf.?? I 
have attached a copy of the letter we sent to him, as well as the preliminary 
program for the October 20 DRCLAS Corporate Partners Program.? When we called 
to follow up, we were told that it was unlikely that Ken Lay would be able to 
participate, so we extended the invitation to Jeff Skilling as well.? We 
would be delighted to have either one speak on the case of Enron at the 
event. 

Thanks again, and please let me know if there is someone in Lay's office with 
whom I should follow up after you speak with him. 

Best, 
Ellen

Hello to the Direct Access Coalition:

Below you will find a summary of the press strategy that Edelman Public
Relations intends to employ over the coming weeks in collaboration with the
Alliance for Retail Energy Markets and the broader Direct Access Coalition.
I will also outline the information that I need from Direct Access Coalition
members who are willing to be involved in media outreach and interviews.
And finally, I have attached supporting documents that you can use as
background material to prep for your responses to any media inquiries that
you may receive.

This Week

1.   We are drafting a "pitch letter" to send out by the end of this week
via blast e-mail and fax to the following media lists: 1)capitol press corps
reporters; 2) mainstream media reporters working the energy crisis; and 3)
trade media.  We may also outreach to our editorial board list as well.  Our
pitch will be focused on what it will really mean for small business and C&I
customers to lose the option of retail choice at a time when they are
suffering the financial hardships of skyrocketing energy bills. We will
address the effect on California's future business climate if direct access
is not preserved through legislation that corrects the problems that AB1x
caused for retail choice.  And finally, we will address the point that no
matter what direction California ultimately takes, direct access must be a
part of the solution.  Reporters have seen the recent polls which illustrate
California businesses' concerns with the path the state is on so this is a
prime opportunity to build on those recent media stories.

2.    We recommend a conference call with AReM and the Direct Access
Coalition on Friday to address the questions and suggestions on the press
strategy outlined here.

3.     Determine which people in the Direct Access Coalition are willing to
take media calls on behalf of the coalition.

Next Week

1.   Follow up with key reporters who received the pitch letter.

2.   Evaluate the language of SB 27x and determine whether there will be an
opportunity to hold a news conference with Sen. Bowen in the near future.
Monitor movement at the PUC and determine whether a press conference may be
effective in this arena, or whether we may need to use the option of sending
a media alert before the March 7 hearing, followed by a news release after
the hearing.

3.   Place op-eds (opinion pieces) with key newspapers.

4.   Contact radio news shows and TV public affairs shows (i.e. California
Capitol Week and the California Report) to secure
media interviews.

5.    Revise the SB 27x fact sheet (attached) to reflect the realities of
the amended language in SB 27x.

 What We Need From You

1.  If you are willing to speak with the media, or you have
customers/clients with a positive direct access story to tell, please
respond to this email as soon as you can with your name and contact
information.

2.  If you have draft op-eds written that need to be placed with newspapers
on behalf of your association and the broader coalition, we are willing to
do this for the you.

3.  If you have colleagues and/or staff that are already working with the
media it would be helpful to have this information so that we can
collaborate as necessary.

Subject: Tax Review of California Assembly Bill No. 128


Attached please find a Tax Review of California Assembly Bill No. 128 ("AB 
128X").  The Tax Review sets out the practical implication (increased cost to 
purchasers) and constitutional deficiencies of AB 128X.

The third paragraph of the Tax Review details the mathematical computation of 
the tax and the resulting purchaser price increase.  The computation sales 
price, $300/MWh, reflects the SP15 (Southern California) weighted average 
index price ($302.88), rounded to the nearest hundred, as reported in 
Megawatt Daily's May 8th MarketReport.  However, it may be more effective to 
present the mathematical computation with a price closer to the proposed base 
price of $60/MWh.  We are available to assist in presenting the computation 
utilizing whichever numbers you deem appropriate.

The California Senate has passed SB 1X, Windfall Profits Tax on Electric 
Generators.  We will forward a similar memorandum addressing SB 1X.

We are available to address questions and/or comments.  Thanks.

Subject: Senate passes Alper/Davis Bill 30-0

AB 265 passed through the Senate a few minutes ago.  It now must go to the 
Assembly, where there is still a lot of uncertainty about what changes the 
Assembly will want to the bill.  We still haven't seen the latest 
"republican" language.

Also, AB 265 is double joined to AB 970, controversial siting bill.  To the 
extent one or the other fails, they both fail.

AB 265 (Davis/Alpert) has:

1.  a 6.5 cent/kWh energy rate cap through 2002, with potential extension 
through 2003.
2.  Applicable to residential, small commercial (up to 100 kW)
3.  Opt-in provision for large industrial/agricultural customers at 6.5 cents 
with an annual true-up
4.  Use of revenues from utility generation assets (including PPA) to offset 
undercollections.
5.  Reasonableness review for San Diego G&E

Will update with more information as available.

No news about SCE.

Steve, I spoke with Ginger about your availability to deliver a keynote 
address at a Maguire Energy Institute conference on "Electricity Deregulation 
Report Card" on November 1.  Jeff is on this board, and they asked us if we 
could enlist Ken Lay to deliver this keynote.  Ken is scheduled to be at a 
board meeting in Washington this date, so is not available.   I suggested 
that you may be a suitable replacement, and they are very interested in the 
prospect of your participation.

The link below is to the website for this conference, and the keynote would 
be delivered from 1:00p-1:30p, immediately following the luncheon.  Please 
let me know if you are available and willing to deliver this keynote; I would 
appreciate a response today if possible.

Thanks, SRS

To date, reports on Enron's role in California have been limited to a repri=

retiring from both positions in two weeks.=20

In the past both Chubu Electric and the Federation of Electric Power=20

e=20
generally considered to be ultra conservative and unsupported by facts. As =
a=20
result, we have tended to ignore his comments. However, on this occasion I=

think we need to set the record straight on Enron's role in California. I=
=20
would welcome your thoughts on whether we should let the comments pass or=
=20
respond.

Over the past few months we have received various statements from Houston=

(for both internal and external consumption) explaining Enron's role in=20
California. Most recently (May 10) we received from Peggy Mahoney (via Vanc=

comprehensive statement that has recently been put together that we could=

distribute here. If not, we can put something together here tomorrow and=20
email it across to you for approval, with the aim of getting something out=

Wednesday.

As an aside, we had a record 3,766 visitors to the EJ website last Friday,=

We can create significant mutual benefit by partnering with a firm which is 
focussed on developing IT systems for bulk power systems:

 We need to take our deregulation model to the next level of detail by having 
IT solutions which will support our view of how the market ought to work.
 The IT firm would benefit from our access to the policy makers (domestic and 
international)  whose decisions will make the IT firm's systems either 
successful or obsolete.
Call me if you would like to discuss.

To all--Steve Horn's Investment group has been approached to possibly invest 
in a company, Soft____, that makes EMS and tagging systems (which BPA is 
using and PGE may use).  We met w/ Shashi Patel of Steve's group today and 
discussed that there are competitors out there, including OATI, Alstom ESCA 
(who are partnered with Ross Perot).  Ross Perot has approached Enron about 
promoting its system in the Midwest ISO.   We used this system for Enron 
control area's EMS.  Ross Perot is going to contact Steve Kean to set up a 
meeting to show us his product.  Also, Kevin Presto thinks that OATI would be 
a good investment.

Steve Kean--Steve Horn and Shashi Patel are interested in being included in a 
presentation by Perot.

Sarah and Joe--Can you think of any FERC regulatory constraints that would 
limit Enron's ability to invest in one of the software providers to 
utilities/RTOS?  I couldn't think of any reason off hand. 

Thanks.

What are your thoughts?  I recommend talking with Steve Kean and Joe Hartsoe 
ASAP to coordinate with the ESCA/OATI/Perot System consortium regarding the 
Midwest ISO.  Dick George from ESCA mentioned that Ross Perot would like to 
make contact at a high level inside Enron to discuss the merits of Enron 
supporting a for-profit transco structure for the Midwest ISO.  The 
ESCA/OATI/Perot System consortium is offering a system to the Midwest ISO 
that is designed to support  a for-profit transco.  The consortium's primary 
competitor (ABB) has a system that supports the more structured ISO 
environment (similar to California and PJM).

Subject: Midwest ISO information...



Kevin and Lloyd,

The Signatories of the Midwest ISO follow:
Allegheny Power
Ameren (formerly Union Electric and Central Illinois Public Service Company)
CILCO
Cinergy
Commonwealth Edison
Hoosier Energy Rural Electric Cooperative
Illinois Power
Kentucky Utilities
Louisville Gas & Electric
Northern States Power
Wabash Valley Power
Wisconsin Electric

The status of the formation is anti-profit, i.e. a holding pattern is in
place with a FERC Tariff request to carry over seven years.  The view is
that a for-profit-ISO goes completely against the grain and that only a
mandate by FERC will get them to change.  Given Entergy's fight with FERC
even a mandate will be a hard fought court exercise.

At present there are sixteen control areas therefore the system requirement
with grandfathered contracts in each is odious.

Nevertheless, the form ESCA and our partners Perot, OATI and Tenfold offer
is a full-up system ready for a for-profit implementation.  As you might
expect the division of responsibilities on the proposal is Perot as Program
Manager (their position with the California ISO again), OATI for Tagging and
Congestion Management, Tenfold for Settlement and Billing, and finally ESCA
for the EMS/Market Systems.  We prefer a for-profit model as it betters our
offering and provides more near-term opportunity.

Discussions with the Perot, OATI and Tenfold partners concurred that sharing
information with Enron and vice-versa would help all of us understand how
each side may be able to position ourselves with the Midwest ISO.  Mutual
help and cooperation is to our partners, ESCA's and it would seem Enron's
advantage.

Joe and Tom:  Either Bill Ford is a major Democrat or this signals a major 
shift which serves as a strong indicator that Congress will face new 
pressures next Congress to address Global Warming.  This is truly a 
remarkable speech.

FORD PREDICTS END OF CAR POLLUTION
The Independent (UK)
6 October 2000

Internet:
http://www.independent.co.uk/news/UK/Environment/2000-10/ford061000.shtml

The 100-year reign of the polluting internal combustion engine is coming to
an end, Bill Ford, chairman of the Ford Motor Company, said yesterday. It
will soon be replaced in motor vehicles by the hydrogen fuel cell, which
emits no pollution whatsoever and so can reduce the build-up of greenhouse
gases causing climate change, Mr. Ford, great-grandson of the company's
founder, Henry Ford, told the Greenpeace Business Conference in London.

In a remarkable speech from a motor manufacturer, in which he proclaimed his
own environmental credentials, Mr. Ford, 43, accepted that the automobile had
had a serious negative impact on the environment, and that his industry had
wrongly played down the threat from global warming.  And the head of the
world's second biggest car company raised eyebrows even further when he said
that he could foresee the day when people would not want to own cars, but
merely have access to mobility.

Detroit-born Mr. Ford, who has been chairman since the start of last year,
proclaimed that climate change was the most challenging issue facing the
world and that anyone who disagreed was "in denial". Ford itself had moved on
from that position, he said. But he felt the Kyoto protocol, the 1997 pact in
which the industrialised nations agreed to try to limit their emission of
greenhouse gases, would not provide deep enough cuts to halt global warming.
Only the marketplace, making new technology widely available, could tackle
the problem.

A fuel cell creates energy by an electrochemical process similar to that in a
battery: it lets hydrogen and oxygen react together to produce electricity
and water vapour. It does not run down or need recharging, working as long as
the hydrogen fuel is available, but most importantly, it does not produce any
CO2, the basic by-product of any carbon-based fuel such as oil, gas or coal.
Every major car company in the world is throwing huge sums into developing
the technology: Ford is spending $1bn (?690m) between now and 2004, while
Daimler-Chrysler, regarded as the leader in the field, has spent $700m. All
the main manufacturers have prototype fuel-cell cars running and there is a
race to bring them to market. Honda and Toyota expect to do so in 2003, while
Ford and Daimler-Chrysler are aiming at 2004.

"I believe fuel cells will finally end the 100-year reign of the internal
combustion engine," Mr. Ford said, adding that the technology was "the holy
grail" of the motor industry. Prophesying the demise of car ownership, he
said:  "The day will come when the whole notion of car ownership is
antiquated," he said. Mr. Ford was reflecting advanced motor industry
thinking, which suggests many people might not want to pay for a car of their
own if they could be guaranteed mobility on demand from a local hire network.

You probably saw the announcement that Mike Mcconnell is now CEO of Enron 
Global Markets.  EGM will be focussing on a number of new and existing 
markets (including coal, LNG, crude and products, interest rates, 
agricultural commodities, equities, weather, etc).  One of the markets Mike's 
group is actively considering is transport capacity.  I mentioned your work 
in the area.  He is anxious to see it and meet with you after he has had a 
chance to review it.

Sorry about the short notice, I just found out today.  I have not agreed to=

anyone, I said I would talk to you and try.

Your thoughts?

Greg,
I just talked to Gary and he said you guys had a terrific meeting.
We are so glad to have Enron as a Cornerstone Member and look forward to=20
working with you as one of our Advisory Board members.
As Gary mentioned, we are having our Houston ePanel on Thursday, May 3. =20

eEnergy:  Evolving Trends in the Deregulation of the Electric Industry
The U.S. electric industry is undergoing a sea change in the way it deliver=
s=20
electricity to millions of households and businesses nationwide. The $220=

Online Niche Players Capitalize on Natural-Gas Shortage, Bypass Utilities

SmartEnergy, a Con Edison competitor, is offering New York and Westchester=
=20
consumers price protection with the ability to lock-in today's natural-gas=
=20
rates for a period of one year. In a separate announcement, myHomeKey.com=
=20
announced that it will offer energy savings packages designed to reduce=20
energy consumption and lower rates for customers in the face of rising=20
energy costs.

ANALYSIS: As reports continue to accumulate that a natural-gas shortage=20
will send prices skyrocketing this winter (see my IssueAlert from Oct.=20
9 on the subject), the most common response from electric utilities has=20
been to warn their customers that they will see higher rates over the next=
=20
few months. I can point to several examples. Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy=
=20
announced a few weeks back that its natural-gas customers could face heatin=
g=20
bills that are 35 to 50 percent higher than their bills last winter. Domini=
on=20
East Ohio has warned its residential customers that they can expect to=20
pay about $70 more per month for natural gas from November through January.=
=20
And the warnings are coming not only in the Midwest and Northeast=01*where=
=20
low winter temperatures drive up energy bills every year=01*but in the West=
=20
as well. In California, PG&E warns that its customers can expect to see=20
their winter bills increase by about $25, to an average bill of $75 (compar=
ed=20
to $50 last winter). These are just a few examples of utility companies=20
across the United States playing damage control, trying to minimize the=20
customer outrage when customers suddenly see their bills double or triple.

Along with their warnings, these utilities give reasons=01*perhaps seen as=
=20
excuses by the public=01*for the rising cost of energy. There is a shortage=
=20
of natural gas across the country, brought about by a drop-off in productio=
n.=20
It was an unusually hot summer, which depleted supplies for energy. Demand=
=20
in general has grown to surprising levels.

Meanwhile, start-up online companies that many of us have not even heard=20
of are using the rise in natural-gas prices as a golden marketing=20
opportunity,=20
and attempting to take business away from traditional utility companies.=20
SmartEnergy is a perfect example. In existence just since April 1999, =20
SmartEnergy offers electricity and natural gas to residential and small=20
business customers. According to EnergyGuide.com, for an average home in=20
New York City, SmartEnergy's natural-gas rates typically have run about=20
$189 per month, compared Con Edison's $140. Under its new promotion,=20
SmartEnergy's=20
plan for natural gas guarantees that New York City and Westchester gas=20
customers who sign on with their service now will be locked into current=20
natural-gas rates for the next 12 months. This promotion comes at an ideal=
=20
time for those who opt to switch, as natural-gas prices should begin their=
=20
projected sharp increase over the next few weeks. Based on recent forecasts=
,=20
SmartEnergy is claiming that Con Edison customers who make the switch can=
=20
expect to save up to 40 percent on their energy through the winter months.=
=20
The start-up company also is offering 500 United Airlines Mileage Plus=20
Reward Miles credit and $25 sign-up bonus to entice customers away from=20
Con Edison.=20

Based on the available information about SmartEnergy, it is unclear how=20
the online provider will be able to guarantee the 40-percent reduction=20
in natural-gas rates. I would presume that SmartEnergy has entered into=20
some hedging strategies to minimize its risk in the event that natural-gas=
=20
prices remain high into the next year. Any prudent provider would have=20
a hedging strategy to protect itself, and locking itself into 12-month=20
contracts without its own contracts for obtaining natural gas at spot marke=
t=20
prices would certainly raise questions about the future of SmartEnergy.=20
In addition, SmartEnergy will have difficulty in recruiting customers away=
=20
from Con Edison and other utility providers. Many customers still have=20
reservations about signing on with an online company that they do not know.=
=20
There will be some customers who jump at the chance to lock in current=20
rates for 12 months, but many others will stick with the company that they=
=20
know even if their rates increase.

I did a quick search around Con Edison's Website to see if it might be=20
offering an alternative offer to retain its customers, but could find nothi=
ng=20
that the utility is doing to specifically address the projected increase=20
in natural-gas prices this winter. Con Edison does offer a level billing=20
program in which customers receive a consistent bill amount each month,=20
alleviating fluctuation in their bills. Yet, as a utility company, Con=20
Edison has a standard offer of service that regulators closely monitor.=20
It is possible that Con Edison could request changes to the standard offer=
=20
service, which would likely need to be approved by the New York Public=20
Service Commission. The PSC could agree, or determine that the competitive=
=20
offers by providers such as Smart Energy are a positive result of=20
deregulation.=20
In addition, Con Edison could be hampered by fuel contracts that may not=20
allow it much flexibility with regard to lowering its rates. Overall, Con=
=20
Edison probably does not have a lot of flexibility regarding the rates=20
it can charge customers, thereby making this offer from SmartEnergy difficu=
lt=20
to beat.

The other online start-up taking advantage of natural-gas prices is=20
myHomeKey.com,=20
which made a recent promise to reduce home heating, oil, natural-gas, and=
=20
electricity rates. The marketing route that this online start-up is taking=
=20
is energy efficiency=01*teaching households how to more effectively use the=
ir=20
energy and, hopefully, save money as a result. Energy is not the only servi=
ce=20
of the myHomeKey.com; it is also involved in home maintenance and repair,=
=20
appliances, home monitoring and moving services. Yet, I learned that=20
myHomeKey.com=20
just recently launched co-branded sites with KeySpan Corp. and TXU Energy=
=20
Services to "provide millions of local customers" with the ability to check=
=20
energy efficiency in their homes.

What's important to note about these two developments is the advantage=20
that online energy providers have over traditional utilities. As utilities=
=20
try to disengage themselves from regulatory-bound rate structures, online=
=20
companies have the freedom and flexibility to offer attractive products=20
and billing options to customers in deregulated states. There are the onlin=
e=20
providers that we know about, such as Utility.com and Essential.com.=20
Utility.com=20
has not yet started to sell natural gas, although it has established a=20
partnership with Sempra Energy in which Sempra Energy Trading will sell=20
natural gas in deregulated markets via the Utility.com Web site. Utility.co=
m=20
plans to start selling natural gas by the end of this year, but it has=20
not developed any marketing campaign in this regard. Essential.com continue=
s=20
to open up its service across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions. Yet,=
=20
on a weekly basis, new start-up online energy providers surface, eager=20
to grab their own share of the retail market.=20

I also wonder where The New Power Company is in all of this rush to=20
capitalize=20
on the marketing opportunities surrounding the rise in natural-gas prices.=
=20
It would seem like a natural for TNPC to make a big splash with its own=20

I think you, or someone in your group, should cover this.  The attendees are 
operations focussed and may be interested in issues such as siting, 
interconnection and environmental issues.  Also, from a more macro 
perspective, what kinds of demands the new industry structure may place on 
operators  -- the importance of flexibility in asset operations (ie the 
premium the market will place on quick response) or the challenges of 
different scheduling regimes between the gas and power markets.

Steve,
As we discussed the other day, Enron's Global Asset Management Conference 
committee would like to invite you to be the sponsor for our panel discussion 
on Enron's Regulatory and Governmental Affairs issues for this conference 
which is being held at the Woodlands Conference Center on October 8-11.  We 
would like to have your panel discussion on October 9, from 3:30-5:30PM.  We 
would like to ask that the you to put together a session that highlights 
topics that provide a insight from both a national and international 
perspective  

The conference committee has chosen the One Enron theme since the attendees 
at the conference are coming from all the Enron business units both 
domestically and internationally. The estimated attendance at the conference 
will be 225 Enron and Joint Venture employees.  The invitations are being 
issued enterprise-wide to employees who are engaged in 
operations/maintenance/purchasing./sourcing  This conference is the expansion 
of the annual plant managers' conference that is held each year in Houston.  
We are replacing it with what we will be a "Best in Class" conference 
addressing multiple topics that will provide direction that will result in 
lower costs, increased earnings and employee retention.  We will also be 
utilizing this conference as an additional mentoring activity for our 
Minority/Women Business Enterprise suppliers.
I hope that you will accept our invitation, because I know many of the 
participates will benefit from your panels experiences and knowledge.

An agenda has been attached for your review, however it is still in 
development.


If you have any questions, I can be reached at (713) 646-8235.

Steve,

Thanks a lot for coming to class and talking to us on Tuesday.  
I think your presentation had a strong impact on Rice students, and many of 
them, including me, got a much better idea of Enron and its businesses.

I am not sure if you were going to distribute the copy of your presentation 
to us, but I certainly would consider it useful for my self-education about 
the company.
Let me know if I could possibly get a copy from you.

As I mentioned to you on Tuesday, I am starting full-time at Enron on the 
15th of January as a manager in Research Group, under Vince Kaminski.
I would like for us to go out for lunch sometime in January, if this is OK 
with you.

Sincerely,

Jason Sokolov

Attached is a draft letter.  I tried to get it down to one page, but it can 
use more reduction. I also need info on when the 750MW of capacity will be in 
service.  I am leaving on holiday, so someone (like Rick) will have to 
complete the letter.

Nick,

Sorry for the delay.  I have made a few notes for you to consider and a 
couple of editorial changes.  I think the information is useful and well

(Note from Maureen:  I renamed the docs as version B.)  I've only attached

I think this is a great initiative, but it is critically important that any 
announcement of the panel makes it crystal clear that the objective of the 
group is to come up with standards to facilitiate competition.  We will do 
nothing but waste time if it becomes a negotiation over competition.  the 
best and politically easiest time to make that objective clear is in the 
original announcement, not after the group gets underway.  Can we get in 
touch with DOE to make sure they pick this up?

Jeff:  I have followed up with other DOE politicals who advised they will 
meet this Thursday with Bob Gee to finalize and approve his speech to NARUC 
on Monday, July 24th.  It is looking positive that he may be positioned to 
make the announcement Monday.  However, DOE will likely need to revisit some 
folks on the current Blue Ribbon Reliability Panel in order to replace some 
of the utility transmission-only focused members with others who focus on 
business practices plus add additional people to represent the internet  like 
APX, Altra, and HoustonStreet.Com. (these are Steve Kean's suggestions.)  
Too, I have been cautioned about referring to the Blue Ribbon Reliability 
Panel as a model since their timeline was slow, but rather suggest the TVA 
Blue Ribbon Panel model since they were able to issue a report after only 
four meetings.  I have asked for this issue to be brought to Secretary 
Richardson's attention and advised this will be done this week.  I have also 
discussed this with John Anderson of ELCON who is supportive.

Subject: Mtg w/Bob Gee

Cynthia and I met with Bob Gee regarding a potential role for DOE in creating 
a national standards board.  Bob appeared comfortable with establishing a 
"Blue Ribbon" panel, similar to the reliability panel, to address this 
issue.  In fact, Bob suggested that the reliability panel, which includes a 
balance of key stakeholders, could be re-tasked with this issue.

We recommended that the focus of any panel should be on the structure 
(governance, segments, executive committees) and scope of the organization 
(retail, wholesale, gas, electric).  Bob plans to follow-up with us next week.

Jeff

		 Subject: DRAFT of materials for Governor

Greetings:

Attached is the draft.  I've attempted to capture everyone's comments.  The 
only piece that is not likely to go this evening is the piece providing 
comments on the Governor's specific proposals.  That will likely go first 
thing tomorrow morning.  You'll note that only one of the Governor's 
proposals currently has any comments attached to it.  Comments on the 
Governor's proposals are appreciated.  The remainder of the materials will go 
to the Governor's staff later this evening; so any and all comments on those 
portions are welcomed and appreciated.  Thanks to all for the assistance, 
particularly in light of the holiday.

Best,
Jeff

help is on the way.  We are going to establish some senior executive 
oversight as well as an executive director (probably someone who came through 
the program).  Charlene is going to be moving into a commercial role (which 
was the original plan when she was brought into the organization).  I'd be 
happy to talk to you in more detail when I get back to Houston.

Hi guys.  

I wanted to let you know that I am extremely concerned about the 
Associate/Analyst program, so much so that I feel all the work I have done, 
and all the time I have spent on the program has had little impact outside 
Wharton/Penn recruiting.  In fact we won't get more than 1 associate from 
Wharton this year for a variety of internal and external reasons.  This 
program has brought incredible talent into the organization, but we have lost 
a lot of momentum over the last two years.

In as much as I would like to continue to support the program, I can't  in 
its current form, and don't have time to fix what I thought we had been 
addressing.  The entire program is disfunctional, and the commercial teams 
are not lending support to the program.  I'd be very happy to spend a few 
minutes of your time (rather than blather on in an email) to give you both my 
overview of the program, and suggest changes and improvements.  

You know you have my support, but the current state of affairs down there has 
gotten me to my rope's end with the program.

Attached are several documents which capture our positions in reaction to 
power and gas pricing, particularly in California.  Included are a detailed 
set of solutions to California's power market woes, which we have provided in 
California and at FERC; a representative speech, and a talking point summary 
designed for more general audiences and the media.  The gas paper was 
prepared in September and needs updating, but I have included it as well.  I 
will get a more integrated message put together and circulated.

I wanted to update you on my conversation this morning with Mark Lindsay=20
regarding next week=01,s budget meeting.

The format will be similar to last year=01,s.  We=01,ll be receiving from M=
ark=01,s=20
group a consolidated spreadsheet of all of our budgets, grouping them by=20
functionality and illustrating 2000 plan, 2000 estimate, and 2001 plan, and=

the variances between.  We will be covering the EPSC and Aviation budgets=

during the same meeting.  Billie and I will get together on Friday to compa=

what the two of us have so far, and then we have a meeting set up for Monda=
y=20
morning with you, Bill, Billie and me to go over everything in advance of=
=20
Tuesday=01,s meeting.

Points that Mark made (no surprises here):
-  Jeff has mentioned that he wants to see reductions in all corporate cost=
=20
centers since our international activities look like they=01,re going away.=
  (We=20
have made significant reductions year to year on our international gov=01,t=
=20
affairs and PR budgets, and I think we can justify that the other cost=20
centers are primarily focused on domestic activities while the individual=
=20
business units budget much of those activities themselves.)
-  Even though we=01,re allocating more overall to the business units this =
year,=20
Jeff will be interested in the gross budget numbers, before any allocations=
.
-  We need to be able to explain any significant budget changes year to yea=
r
 -  Mark particularly emphasized the increase in the PR budget, most of whi=
ch=20
is retained at Corp anyway
 -  We need to be able to explain anything that we=01,ve inherited from the=
=20
business units that is now staying at Corp.  This  applies to the headcount=
=20
that we=01,ve picked up from ENA and from Int=01,l (Dennis=01, group). =20

Lindsay mentioned that there=01,s a possibility that Causey may, in advance=
 of=20
our Tuesday meeting, meet by himself with Skilling to get a general idea of=
=20
where Jeff stands on the corporate budgets as they=01,ve been submitted so =
far,=20
and then come back to us with instructions on any changes that need to be=
=20
made.  If this is the case, we may have to make cuts before we get to prese=
nt=20
our case.

I'm working on our presentation based on that conversation and will forward=
=20
it to you as it progresses.

David,

Sorry for the delayed response.  I'd absolutely like to talk with you about 
applications and potential content for these screens.  As you know, we've 
been interested in creating an electronic bulletin board to promote upcoming 
activities for CR.  I'd like to do something similar for general HR news as 
well.  If that's "doable", I'd love to talk more.  Let me know your 
availability next week.

Subject: Re: Video Screens in EB Elevator Cabs  

I have arranged a tentative agreement with Bowne Business Solutions (13th 
floor graphics) to provide content digitization, encoding and storage for 
video productions.  They will have the capability to output from S-VHS, Beta 
SP and electronic sources, along with minimal editing and creation of basic 
multimedia images suitable for the Enron channel.  Additional costs would be 
incurred by individual departments incrementally as they produced video 
content for the monitors.  Enron would then have a choice of vendors, 
including the in-house graphics group, Innovision (Beth Stier) and others.

We also need to determine the point of demarcation for the "head-end" of the 
video signal for these and any other building monitors.  I don't know if your 
estimates include any of this head-end equipment which would include VTRs, 
modulators, distribution amplifiers, CATV contracts and receivers, satellite, 
etc.  Regardless, we need to talk to the folks who will be producing content 
for these monitors to see what types of capabilities they want to have.

Finally, someone will have to "own" the channel and pre-approve content for 
distribution.  I'm pretty certain that Mark Palmer wants to control the 
content, though I don't think that he wants to manage the production group, 
or create any overkill.

I'd be happy to discuss alternatives with all of you for the content side of 
this project.  Again, I think that the costs will be incremental expenses 
related to creating content rather than capital outlay.

Beth, Mark, Pam, Setev, Terrie, et al. - Are you interested in addressing 
what in-house capabilities you'd like to have with me?

DMM

Subject: Video Screens in EB Elevator Cabs

Beth, Mark - 

I think we are ready to move on implementing flat screen monitors in all of 
Enron Building passenger elevator cabs, i.e. proposal is for two 14" monitors 
per cab, one for Corporate content, other for local Houston messages.  Will 
try to flush mount them in the stainless steel cab panels, for a clean, 
attractive look.    

Technical details have generally been worked out between our group (Steve 
Woods and Harry Grubbs) and Enron's IT Dept.  such that  we know total costs 
are below $500K (more in $350-400K range plus whatever temporary, 
non-elevator monitors appropriate for Three Allen Center occupants).  We have 
a 3 month implementation schedule.

Content can be anything available on Enron's LAN (developed @ the desk top) 
or any video signal, i.e. Cable TV stations, tapes, etc.

Let me know next steps.  We can discuss funding sources.  - Bill

I am enrolled in a Corporate Crisis MGMT class at Rice, and my assignment

Rumor on the street is that ENRON may completely reverse its position on
LMP and come our is support of the concept.  If so, this is very
significant.  It could affect the ability of various organizations to work
closely together.

Is there any truth to this rumor?

attached is a copy of my california testimony.  The proceeding was somewhat 
productive, but turned into a witch hunt at a couple of points.  Our view on 
this is:  the problem is fairly straightforward (demand increases and new 
supplies are inhibited so prices go up and shortages ensue ... sound 
familiar?) and the solutions are straightforward (site the power plants 
suppliers are begging to build, let the utilities hedge outside the exchange, 
and finish the job of opening the interstate grid so power can get from where 
it is to where it is needed).

What it comes down to at this point is FERC is the only entity with the 
authority to start fixing this problem now:  Congress isn't going to get 
anything done this year and the California legislature is (thankfully) out of 
session now.  Our political leaders need to give FERC the room they need to 
act.

Good luck on your speech and give me a call sometime.

SAP Impact:  
File names have changed from "b" + company + rc for MSA booking to "s" + cost 
center for SAP.  Other changes have also been implemented.  Please send a 
Notes mail to "Bill Myers" if you notice any problems, particularly if you 
think that they might be conversion or program related.  (I already know 
about the company description for the MSA spreadsheets where companies are 
rebooked to themselves).

Attached  are spreadsheets with the detail supporting the expenses for 
telephones, data ports, EDI, Enterprise LAN, Enterprise Help Desk, video 
conferencing, Internet access, email, and other services provided to Enron 
business units by Enron Information Services.  These expenses are posted in 
MSA Detail Class 845.

EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, 
and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&T 
calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in 
EB or 3AC.  For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by Tammy Anderson 
for this purpose.  

People specific services for employees are billed to the company and cost 
center corresponding to the employee's HR company and department. Video 
conference usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings 
are based on a company and cost center furnished by the person requesting the 
service.

EIS bills services on a one month lag.  We take a snapshot of the Corporate 
Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha 
phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the HR company and department 
for each employee.  This snapshot is taken at the end of each month for use 
as a source for billing information.  

Please examine these billings for accuracy.  If our billings are incorrect, 
generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting 
Corporate Administrative Services or the person should be moved to the 
correct HR department by contacting your HR representative.  If the room 
number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, this may be 
corrected by sending the room number along with the telephone number to Notes 
Mail ID "Move-Team".

If you wish to move EIS charges after to a different company and/or 
department after billings have been processed or if you wish to discuss an 
alternative to using your HR department for people specific billings, please 
send a message to Notes Mail ID "EIS Billing".

Tim -- Cindy manages this program.
Mary -- please give some thought to how we might solicit employee views on 
this.
Cindy -- I believe we already allow matching of donations to quasi-religious 
organizations: religious schools, for example, and perhaps relief 
organizations like Catholic Relief Services?  I think that if we want to 
consider extending it we should probably discuss it in a smaller group than 
the e-speak forum --  the Enron Foundation Board perhaps?  This could become 
controversial, though (recall the Planned Parenthood debate and the periodic 
attempts of shareholders to add restrictions through the proxy mechanism).

limited.  The money was a combination of individual contributions Ken

I think I understand why people get confused now.  See below, in blue.....  I 
know you mean the Enron PAC has contributed more than $615k to the Bush 
campaign (right?), but it reads like Enron Corp gave money directly to Bush.  
It's a complicated issue -- which I am hoping to simplify with my story!  I'm 
going to use the second quote below in the article.

On Workplace Sleeves, Few Political Hearts
By MELINDA LIGOS

The New York Times
Page 10, Column 2
c. 2000 New York Times Company

An example is Enron, the Houston energy conglomerate, which even suggests how 
much employees should give.
Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman, recently sent top executives a memo on his 
stationery asking them to contribute
$1,000 each to the Bush campaign, said Steven J. Kean, an executive vice 
president. This year, Enron and its
employees have contributed more than $615,000 to the Bush campaign, he said. 

But there are limits, even at companies like Enron. ''We might tell employees 
to go out and vote, but nobody tells
them who to vote for or passes out brochures,'' Mr. Kean said. ''That kind of 
thing is just not acceptable in today's
workplace.''

Lysk draws a parallel between the
time he spends at work sending e-mail messages about animal rights and the 
time other employees take to smoke
cigarettes. (Karen Segrave for The New York Times)

in the APACHI restructuring, and apparently they were unable to  promote him 
to Manager.  (Our lists indicated that he would have been promoted in March).

Cheers!
Lynn

Subject: Gov Geringer meeting

Steve/RIck ---as you may be aware, Governor Geringer personally asked Ken Lay 
to come to the kick off meeting of the Wyoming Energy Task Force, a group 
that was created by legislative mandate last month.  The meeting is on May 
30th in Cheyenne.  Mr. Lay told the Governor that he would not be able to 
make it on that date, but promised that a senior Enron exectutive would be 
there.  I spoke with Governor Geringer's staff person again this past week 
and was hoping that Paul Kaufman could be the senior executive, but no such 
luck (unless you give Paul a huge new title!).  

In talking with Maureen I understand that you have a previous conflict Steve, 
but I am hoping that you can review your calendar to see if you could make an 
adjustment in order to meet the request of the Governor.  Your speech would 
be in the morning--I've been told about 9 o clock or so---which would allow 
for you to leave by noonish.

Steve, our theme for the stock celebration is "Oh, The Places You'll Go," 
which is the title of a Dr. Seuss book.  Everyone on the team loves this idea 
because the messages in the book represent Enron thinking and culture.  In 
case, you aren't familiar with the book, Beth Tilney has a copy.  Our plan is 
to give every employee a book, which will have a note of appreciation on the 
inside cover from Ken, Jeff and Joe.  We are contacting Random House (who 
will contact the Seuss estate) to see if we can purchase 20,000 copies and to 
get permission to use some of the copy in our internal communication 
materials. The per unit cost is considerably lower due to the volume.

We think employees will like this idea.  What do you think?

Mary

much new:

Ken got Jeff's paper
will try to reach Hertzberg on Monday.
Bryson gave an update (very consistent with yours on Fri)
Wants us to think creatively about "how to keep DWR contracts from preventing 
the comprehensive solution" and how to address the concerns of the state 
treasurer.
Ken tried to reach Pete Peterson (Blackstone) but did not make contact.

Leslie:  I have delivered a letter and resume to Senator Domenici's office.
I am attaching a copy of my letter to Senator Domenici and my resume.  There
are already a couple of letters sent to Senator Domenici on my behalf;
however, I do not know the best way to time this thing because President
Bush has to get his administration in place and there are a lot of positions
that will require Senate confirmation and everything is running behind
because of all the post election issues.  If you get a chance to talk with
Steve Cane about my application, I would certainly appreciate it.  I am sure
there are people at Enron close to Senator Domenici and he is the one who
will be making the call, so I would be interested in knowing what you and
Steve think.  In any event, thanks for all your help and let me know if the
attachments do not come through with this e-mail.  I am still somewhat
incompetent when it comes to e-mail technology although I think it is a
great way to communicate.  As an aside, in divorce cases where the two
parties have internet access, I require them to communicate by e-mail.
Thanks and I'll see you back in Roswell.  Chip

Steve/ Cindy

Just want to state a case for this move, (before everyone starts up on the 
movement moratorium issues surronding the " EI" companies -which I understand 
is still in place).

Stella Chan (Director level) is one of 6 expats Apachi have seconded into our 
SK Enron JV in Korea. Because they all mobilized at the same time, Darrell 
Kinder and I put in place a rotation plan whereby some would leave early, 
some extend (so we didnt have everyone leaving the JV at the same time). Its 
worked well to date, and we've mamanged to keep the Partners happy with the 
moves/replacements.

Bottom line with respect to the Project Summer moratorium (in my view) is 
that because Stella will be replaced she is no longer part of the 
'intellectual capital' the buyer (or any future buyer) is seeking to retain, 
and so the move should go ahead.

Hope you concur.

Darrell,

Stella Chan's contract will conclude March 1 2001. She had shown some desire 
to repatriate early and under the repatriation agreement I allowed her to 
start her search (six months prior). Stella's search was very quick and she 
has landed a job with the Corporate Public Affairs group under Harry 
Kingerski, who works for Rick Shapiro, who works for Steve Kean. She has set 
a preliminary job switch for October 16, 2000.

This does not cause me too much concern, for as you are aware Waymon Votaw 
who works in the Southern Cone group under John Guidry has shown a desire to 
be Stella's replacement. The timing of this could work out real well. Please 
pass this to the powers to be for approval so I may move forward with the 
next step with both individuals.

Thanks


Tony

Joe Hartsoe, Rick Shapiro, or Jim Steffes can fill you in on the details of 
what FERC did today.  One question you need to think about is how their 
decision on price caps affects any contracts which we may have indexed to 
California's spot market.  The way it reports the market clearing price will 
change fundamentally if prices over 150 will be accepted but not used to 
clear the market for all bids.  So, if we are using this as a reference price 
in our contracts it may trigger the need to look for alternatives.

USA: FACTBOX-FERC details changes for Calif power market.

11/01/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
on Wednesday approved several actions to revamp California's power market 
over the next two years. 
Immediate changes include the following:
* Eliminate requirement that three utilities - Pacific Gas & Electric, San 
Diego Power and SoCal Edison - must sell all of their power to and buy all 
their power from the state Power Exchange (PX). 
* Require market participants to schedule 95 percent of their transactions in 
the day-ahead markets to reduce chronic underscheduling of load and 
generation and over-reliance on the ISO's real-time imbalance market to meet 
supply. FERC also proposed a penalty charge for scheduling deviations in 
excess of 5 percent of hourly load requirements. 
* Temporary modification of the single-price auction so bids above $150 MWh 
cannot set the market clearing price paid to all bidders. 
* Establish independent, non-stakeholder governing boards for the California 
Power Exchange (PX) and Independent System Operator (ISO). 
* Create congestion management design proposal. 
* Establish generation inter-connection procedures. 
* Explore alternatives to the single price auction by the ISO and PX. 
* Develop market rules to ensure sufficient supply is available to meet load 
and reserve requirements. 
FERC also approved changes to protect wholesale customers from unreasonable 
rates during the time it will take to adopt longer-term market remedies. The 
following price mitigation measures will remain in effect until Dec. 31, 
2002: 
* Single-price auctions for all sales in the ISO and PX markets at or below 
$150 MWh. The single price would be used for all load which clears below this 
amount in the auction. 
* If an auction does not clear below the $150 MWh level, suppliers who choose 
to bid above $150 would be paid their price bid. In other words, the highest 
bid of the day, if above $150 per MWh, would no longer be the clearing price 
paid by all. 
* Sellers receiving above $150 per MWh would be required to report their bids 
to FERC on a weekly basis and provide certain cost information to the agency. 
* The ISO and PX would be required to report monthly information on such 
bids, allowing FERC to monitor competitive conditions and assure just and 
reasonable rates. Sellers would be subject to potential refund liability but 
no lower than their marginal or opportunity cost if FERC finds 
non-competitive conditions. The potential refund liability would extend the 
full 24 months it would take to implement the market reforms.

Jim,

Good to see you last week.  As we begin to look for Japanese employees and in 
particular, RA/GA resources it would seem to make sense to tap into the US 
Graduate Schools (eg Kennedy School, W Wilson School, etc).  It would be a 
real coup if we could find an ex MITI employee for example that was educated 
in the States and had a taste for something "exotic."  It won't necessarily 
be easy.  At HBS we had two Japanese in our section that decided not to go 
back to their sponsoring company.  Today one is working for BCG and the other 
Cargill.

Any thoughts, contacts, etc.

Joe

Does she have any interest in meeting one-on-one or is she just looking for a

Gentlemen

I just got off the phone with David Stark who wanted to better understand the 
thinking behind Enron's preference for a smaller marketing deal rather than 
the full sponsorship that Uva and Stark pitched last week.  I reiterated to 
him that we would not normally entertain such a large deal without a 
significant commercial transaction (or series of transactions) and that the 
size of the opportunity set currently in front of us only justified 
discussing the smaller marketing deal as indicated in Steve's email.  Stark 
pressed to know what value we wanted to see in the set of AOL/TWX/Turner/CNN 
deals that are underway currently.  He was clear in stating that if we had a 
number in mind, he could push other parts of the organization to direct 
business our way sufficient to meet our needs to justify a larger 
sponsorship.  I declined to give him a value, but I think we should discuss 
this in some detail.  

I'll get in touch to set something up.

closure on Mike Dahlke's move to a new role.  There is no doubt in my mind 
that he can do good service in EES, and he has met with several people 
there.  Mike is concerned that he might get stuck, as he apparently was in 
1997, in limbo for a long time, which he found very professionally and 
personally frustrating and stressful.  Can you help, especially in your HR 
capacity?   thanks  mcs

Steve,

Let me know if you agree that we switch to a uniform range of numbers...

Philippe
Proposal for Single Number Range for the New Enron Campus

For the opening of the New Enron Campus and the changing of the street  
address from 1400 Smith St to 1500 Louisiana, we propose that 
Enron elects to take a single DID number range for all in-bound 
telecommunications.
This single number range would bolster the strategic plan of allocating a DID 
to an employee
and that employee can take that number anywhere within the campus in a "Plug 
n Play" environment.

Currently we have over 21000 DID's in operation in the following locations EB 
, 2AC , 3AC , 500/600 Jeffersen and Penzoil Place . 
The numbers are spread across three different ranges :

- 713 853 xxxx ( 6300 numbers )
- 713 345 xxxx ( 10,000 numbers )
- 713 646 xxxx  ( 5,000 numbers )

The proposal is to take a 70,000 number range to cover current and future 
requirements. The benefits are :

 - less confusion to Enron customers and internal users
 - sufficient numbers to allow Enron to expand in the downtown area
 - increased capacity from one  range of numbers to cater for Fax or 
multimedia applications
 - have a new identity to fall in line with ''One Enron'' philosophy

Due to the high utilization of DID numbers in the downtown area, we will not 
get a (713) area code allocation, and we will be looking at the new ( 832) 
area code.
We have been investigating (832) 363(ENE) XXXX as the range, however this 
cannot be guaranteed.

To take this forward, I require high level approval of the scheme, we will 
then pressure the suppliers and regulatory committee's to meet Enron's 
requirements.

Steve:

I asked our consultant who provided assistance on the NEPCO project in 
Pakistan to give us some thoughts on Dabhol.  I have also discussed this with 
Pete van de Gohm and he is working with Steve Reistetter at EE&CC.  Our 
thoughts are that we really need the DPC folks in Mumbai involved, as they 
will have to liaise with the authorities.  They probably are already 
involved, but nobody's bringing me into the loop from that end.

Dear Mike:

I'm probably not going to tell you anything you haven't thought of, but
here's my response:

Doesn't sound too good.  These groups have been losing out in the great
transition between Nehruvian mercantile-socialism and the current effort to
get India--at least half way--into the world economy.  Some of their
demonstrations in Andhra Pradesh recently turned violent.  These also were
focused on privatization issues and the decline of the state-owned sector
(where these groups dominate).  These groups have allies in the more radical
environmental groups.  They are trying to revive their political base and, in
India, there's nothing like a big American company to focus on, particularly
on the issue of electricity rates--something that affects everybody.

Not being familiar with the site, access or connections to the outside world,
I can't comment on those aspects.  I assume Dabhol has a PR effort going to
show how Maharashtra people and industry need reliable supplies of
electricity, etc.

Generally, I think you have to plan for the worst, but look for avenues to
reduce tensions--open up a back channel to the leaders now, hold any
demonstration well short of the perimeter, but let a small group in to
present petitions, etc.

Make sure the state level politicians and senior bureaucrats guarantee the
facility will be protected.  If something really big seems to be in the
works, see if they will put the plant and surrounding area under Section 144
(or whatever the successor emergency regulation is)--it prohibits meetings
and allows the police to break up demonstrations before they get started.
Work with the State Home Secretary and district level Superintendent of
Police to make sure sufficient police will be on site to hold the perimeter
and protect key facilities--the control room, fuel supply, plant.

Above all, make sure an experienced, senior majestrate will be on site
empowered to raise the level of response--but only if really needed.  The
Indians have a well-developed command and control system for these kinds of
demonstrations.  Escalation starts at baton charging and moves on to tear
gas.  If the police are attacked violently and have difficulty holding, the
majestrate can order live firing over the heads of the demonstrators.  If
police are in danger of being overrun and suffering casualties, the
majestrate can order firing into the mob.  Obviously, you don't want things
to go that far.  There are lots of tactical possibilities in the early stages
and cagey police officers will use them.

These are things the police and majestrates can do, but which your own
security force is not legally empowered to do, at least outside the
perimeter.  Your counsel in Maharashtra can tell you what are the legalities
of your own security force using force to protect your property.  Based on
that, you can take the appropriate steps to deploy your own security force.

In the vast majority of cases, these kinds of demonstrations are contained
without much problem.  Very occasionally, they do get out of hand--and one
has to be ready for that.

Hope this helps,

Phil Jones, Ph.D.

Steve, please see below my announcement relative to the upcoming HR changes.  
If you concur, I would like to send this out Monday, 7/31 to all Govt Affairs

Affairs and Administration group.  Kim can be reached at ext. 33833.  Kim's 
assistant is Jennifer Jordan and she can be reached at ext. 37554. 

My team and I have truly enjoyed working with the  Public Affairs and 
Administration Group over the past 3 years .  We have learned a great deal 
and even logged a few miles (to/fro Washington, DC and San Francisco) during 
the course of this partnership.  It has all been a pleasure and I wish each 
of you the best!

Effective August 1, I will assume the Director of Staffing role for the 
Associate and Analyst Program reporting to Charlene Jackson.   Constance 
Charles, my assistant will be transferring with me.

Subject: Peer Group Mapping

On May 10, 2001, a memo was sent out regarding "Peer Group Mapping".  This 
mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each 
activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

Please refer to the attached original memo, if you have not responded to 
David Oxley and have any comments 
please respond to him by May 25, 2001.

Dave Delainey



Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group 
mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a 
functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed 
at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since 
the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most 
activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed 
that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an 
organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All 
functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the 
acttached. 

The actions points from this excercise are:

1 to review and agree the attached mapping 

2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in 
previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them  
as indicated on the attachment.

3 invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider 
questionable or requiring further explanation.

      Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.

      To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final 
VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for 
your ease of
      reference.

Mr. Steve Kean
Executive Vice President
Enron Corp
 
Dear Mr. Steve Kean
 It was such a pleasure having chance do an interview last week. I have a few 
follow up questions.
1)According to today's Wall Street Journal, Mr. Jeffrey Skilling, president 
and chief executive-elect of Enron, is saying the company could sell some 
power to PG&E and SoCal at 55 cents per kilowatt hour. Am I understanding 
your position right? Is it going to be something like a 5 year contract? Will 
it help your business at all?
2)California Power Exchange has decided to cease its operation by the end of 
April. Do you think this is the right decision? How do you think you can set 
up a new competitive market? Or, won't you need such a market? Will it be 
better to use the markets outside Califorinia or to rely on direct trading?
3)How much supply do you have in excess from which you can offer power to 
California?
******************************************************************************

I understand you are very busy but I would really appreciate if you could 
send me a reply at your earliest convenience.
Thank you very much.

I've got Ken Lay tentatively scheduled to speak to Town Hall Los Angeles on 
Tuesday, Aug. 7.  They were thrilled to hear that Ken had an interest in 
speaking to the group, and Jim McNulty with Parsons immediately recognized 
Ken and wants him to speak about the "big energy picture," given Enron's 
global perspective.  They've got a pretty heavy energy calendar in the next 
few months:
 May 16 - Phil Angelides
 June 19 - John Bryson
 July 11 - Steve Ledbetter
 July 26 - Loretta Lynch

You may want to attend these luncheons just to see what  these four have to 
say.  I've asked if Warren Olney could do the interview w/ Ken, and Adrian 
Medawar said she'd call him.

Sandra -- would you check with LABA to see if we could do that meeting the 
same trip (either before or after Town Hall).

Great job lining this one up -- thank you!

See you in San Fran.

Several recent developments, and in the interest of economy (mine!), I am 
copying all of you, who will have varying interests in this.

First, as soon as the upper house of parliament passes legislation, Austria 
will have accelerated their market oppening, to 100% in power by 2001, 
October, and by 2002, October for gas.  Sadia, you will want to reflect this 
in what you are doing for Kyran/EES, and Kathryn, you will want to note this, 
if Investor Relations is updating this data for analysts.  Margaret, FYI to 
you, too.

Second, I note that this decision was reached after being supported by a 
studyby the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), saying 
liberalisation would bring down prices by 12-15%.  Paul H., suggest you have 
Viviana get a copy, and if in English, send copies to Margaret Carson.

Belgian cabinet has approved draft regulation lowering power threshold to 
20GWh p.a.   This goes to 10 GWh on 31 December 2002.  Sadia, I think this is 
again an acceleration, to be reflected in your updated numbers.  Margaret and 
Kathryn, also note.

Finally, Kyran, I see that EnergieNed has issued a study saying that there is 
"not a direct relationship between efficiency and deregulation".  I may take 
issue with this, depending upon what the full text says.  Can you work with 
Teun/Sadia to obtain a copy, and, if not too lengthy, get it translated for 
my review (and presumably your's, too)?  thanks

Please do not hesitate to contact me should any of you have any questions.    
thanks  mcs

		 Subject: CA Supply Realities

Attached is a memo comparing the CEC's forecasted supply and a more realistic 
look at what additional resources might be available this summer.

The bottom line is that:

1.  The CEC significantly underestimates the outages that may occur this 
summer.  They estimate in their 5,000 MW supply deficit for the summer that 
expected outages will be around 3,000MW.  However, November and December saw 
significantly higher outage levels.  (7,265 MWs) The FERC has investigated 
these outages and found no improprieties- just that the plants are overtaxed 
from running at higher than normal capacities.

2.  There are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the 1,244 MWs of projected 
supply from rerating/restarting existing thermal and renewable projects.  It 
is very unclear how much of this will be able to come on line by this summer, 
if at all.  As evidenced by the e-mail I sent out this morning, local 
communities may be very opposed to restarting shut down units.  In addition, 
these units are likely to be uneconomical.

3.  In the existing resource pool, there are roughly 1,430 MWs of peaking or 
other generation units that are running up against their operating hour 
limitations from air quality regulations.  The Governor has ordered the local 
air quality districts to address these restrictions,  We are beginning to 
seem some movement; however, the US EPA has yet to weigh in on these relaxed 
standards.

4.  The distributed generation/back-up generation capacity to make up some of 
the shortfall is still an unknown.  While there has been some relaxing of the 
limitations on run hours for back-up generation at "essential public 
services" the increase in DG is expected from "clean" sources, not diesel 
emergency generators.

5.  The CEC is doing everything it can to get 50+ MW peaking units on-line by 
this summer.  They are promising a 21-day permit application approval process 
and are offering to pay half of the cost of offsets, for "clean" sources of 
generation in critical areas.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.

POWER POINTS:Calif Gov Fiddles As Summer Likely To Burn 
By Mark Golden

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 
    

  NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Once there was a bride whose pianist became ill the
night before a beachfront wedding. As she frantically tried to find a new
pianist, the radio blared an alert: A 40-foot tidal wave was headed straight
for the beach.
    
?


"I just will not let this pianist ruin my wedding," muttered the bride as she 
turned the radio off. 
California Gov. Gray Davis and the state Legislature have no better sense of 
priorities than the bride did. They've been obsessing over the financial 
solvency of the state's utilities for three months, instead of making 
progress on the bigger problem: the huge shortage of electricity expected to 
hit the state this summer. California's multibillion dollar purchase of the 
utilities' transmission lines won't add one megawatt to the supply of 
electricity. 
How big is the imbalance between supply and expected summer demand? The 
California Energy Commission forecast two weeks ago that the 60,000-megawatt 
system might just squeak by with 87 MW to spare in a bad heat wave. But 
nobody takes that forecast seriously. 
The CEC's numbers are way off base. California's electricity demand could 
exceed supply by 5%, or 2,000 MW, on days with typical summer weather. That 
2,000 MW shortfall will be made up by turning out the lights in 2 million 
homes, or a mix of homes, businesses and industry. A bad heat wave would get 
shortages several times that size. As the blackouts roll through parts of the 
state every weekday that temperatures are at or above normal, every business 
and home will take its turn at getting by without electricity for an hour or 
so. What factory can operate under such conditions? Will the state's elderly 
survive the heat exposure? 
The CEC put the capacity of generators in the state at about 54,000, but it 
used original capacity figures. Most of California's big power plants are 
more than 30 years old. They can't produce as much power as they once did, so 
subtract about 7,000 MW from their rated capacity. 
About 15,000 MW of the state's capacity is now controlled by merchant energy 
companies Calpine (CPN), Duke Energy (DUK), Dynegy (DYN), Mirant (MIR), 
Reliant Energy (REI) and Williams Cos. (WMB). They say they already have sold 
much of the power they will generate this summer to out-of-state western 
utilities. But the CEC ignored that. 
Hydroelectric generation in the western states is expected to be just 60% of 
normal this spring and summer. Western utilities have been buying up supplies 
since last fall. California's PG&E (PCG) and Edison International (EIX) 
couldn't do that, of course, because they're nearly bankrupt. 
Nobody knows exactly how much power has already been sold out of state. A 
trader at one California merchant power company estimated 5,000 MW. In a 
recent auction of transmission line use, capacity to move electricity out of 
California sold for up to 15 times the price of transmission capacity to move 
power into the state. 
The CEC ignored the sales of California power to out-of-state generators in 
its rosy summer outlook and ignored the forecast for below-normal hydropower, 
which depends on winter snowfall. The snowfall season is three-fourths over 
now, making a hydropower shortage pretty much a done deal. Yet the CEC used 
normal northwest hydropower production in its forecast. Take off another 
2,000 MW. 
The commission expects 3,000 MW of generators to be off line for unplanned 
repairs when the heat wave hits. That's California's historic average. But 
outages usually increase dramatically during a heat wave. Take off another 
2,000 MW. 
The commission expects all 1,000 MW of Davis' recently announced peaking 
generators to be on line for the summer. "No way," says the industry. 
Instead of the CEC's estimate of 61,000 MW, then, California can expect 
available supply of only 44,000 MW. The state needs 51,000 MW to meet demand 
and maintain recommended reserves in the kind of heat wave it gets, on 
average, every two summers. 
People in the industry have been telling the governor for nine months that 
there's no way to raise supply to meet demand this year or next. Siting and 
building power plants takes too long. Demand has to be reduced to the level 
of supply. 
The current course is to reduce demand through blackouts. Pricing offers a 
better way. If the state raised electricity rates immediately - a step no 
longer opposed even by California consumer group The Utility Reform Network - 
California would stop burning through the natural gas and water reserves 
needed to keep generators running this summer. 
Davis insists on solving the crisis without a rate increase big enough to 
damp demand. Several western U.S. utilities outside California have already 
imposed such rate hikes. Davis is focused on buying power, even though 
California can't subsidize consumption of artificially cheap power much 
longer. The Department of Water Resources is signing 10-year power supply 
contracts at hefty prices that fully reflect today's supply-demand imbalance. 
Instead, he should be addressing the imbalance, which must be dealt with 
sooner (by prices) or later (by blackouts). Raise California rates 
significantly now. Cut demand, and the wholesale price for electricity comes 
crashing down. Then sign long-term contracts at the lower rates. 
Davis is committing California's citizens and businesses to 10 years of 
overpriced electricity. After that, he says, he will try to reduce demand. 
His streak of bad decisions in this crisis continues unbroken.

Most of West in the Same Power Jam as California
Utilities: Other states ran their grids at fever pitches as populations 
swelled and few new energy sources were developed. Now, also facing 
blackouts, they want to tilt balance of power away from the Golden State and 
toward themselves.
By PETER G. GOSSELIN, Times Staff Writer
?????WINTERSBURG, Ariz.--For more than a century, California ran a simple 
account with the rest of the West: It demanded and the West supplied, most 
especially water and power.
?????But as the Western states have ballooned in the last decade--in no small 
part because of an outbound trek of Californians--this simple, supply-demand 
relationship has broken down.
?????Fundamentally, the rest of the West has outgrown its electrical system 
just as California has its own. And it has done so in very much the same 
way--by adding too many people without enough new power or conservation.
?????Indeed, statistics show that much of the rest of the West would have 
been on the verge of trouble even without California's help and may yet face 
the sort of rolling blackouts that have wreaked so much havoc in the Golden 
State.
?????The booming Southwest has run its power grid at such a fever pitch that 
its planning reserves--the extra power that utilities build in to handle 
emergencies--have shrunk to levels that many regulators and industry experts 
consider dangerous.
?????Almost none of the West save Montana has increased its power production 
at anything like the pace of its population growth during the last decade. 
Despite the long economic boom of the 1990s, which smiled especially on the 
West, several, such as Arizona, have failed to complete a single new power 
plant.
?????"We don't know how bad it's going to be yet," said Utah's Republican 
governor, Mike Leavitt. "We won't know that until May, June, July and August, 
when everyone in the Southwest turns on their swamp coolers."
?????In trying to dodge the blackout bullet, many Western leaders are seeking 
to force a great change on the region: to renegotiate their states' basic 
deal with California. They want to end an old relationship--that between 
center and hinterland, colonizer and colonized--and establish a new one that 
could curtail California's long regional dominance.
?????In the strange chemistry of the moment--when a once-Republican state 
government has turned Democratic and a once-Democratic national government 
has turned Republican, when the battle is to a large extent over privately 
owned electricity rather than publicly controlled water--they could actually 
meet with some success.
?????"California spent the 20th century decolonizing itself from Wall Street 
and the East," said Kevin Starr, the state librarian and author of a 
multivolume history of California. "Now, all of a sudden, there's a dramatic 
possibility of it being recolonized, at least in part, by the rest of the 
West."

?????Captive Plants Feed Power to California
?????Ground zero for these changes lies 50 miles west of Phoenix in the dry 
scrublands of Wintersburg. This is home to the Palo Verde nuclear facility, 
now the nation's single biggest power producer. It will soon be home as well 
to between three and six new gas-fired power plants that, combined, will 
produce even more electricity than their giant neighbor.
?????Palo Verde represents a great deal about the old, fraying world of 
regulated utilities and about the supply-demand relationships that California 
once maintained with the rest of the West.
?????More than one-quarter of the plant is owned by Los Angeles' municipal 
utility, the Department of Water and Power, several other California cities 
and Southern California Edison.
?????A row of steel latticework towers runs off toward California, carrying a 
transmission line from plant to consumer. California has big stakes in a 
half-dozen similarly captive plants in an arc of states from Nevada to New 
Mexico.
?????From California's point of view, the beauty of these projects has been 
that they provided near-certain power without the muss of meeting state 
pollution standards or the political hassle of building closer to home.
?????And at least until the mid-1990s, California regulators virtually 
guaranteed that their owners covered their costs and made profits, even if 
plants' power wasn't immediately needed.
?????"The first principle of the old system was that you had to be able to 
meet demand, no matter what," said Paul L. Joskow, a veteran utility 
economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
?????"If you had too much power, if it cost you a little too much, that was 
less important than being sure you could meet demand." And, he added, "you 
had regulators watching to make sure you did."
?????The gas-fired plants that are about to pop up in Wintersburg are also 
representative, but of the new, deregulated world of power production. 
Although they will crowd in around Palo Verde and tap into the same 
California transmission line, they are being built on an entirely different 
business premise: selling power to the highest bidder.
?????In fact, the reason this empty patch of desert has become such an 
electricity hot spot lately is not Palo Verde itself, but its huge 
transmission lines. In addition to the California line, four others fan out 
from the plant: two back to Phoenix, one east to New Mexico, and one north to 
Utah and from there to the Northwest.
?????All were built to hard-wire the nuclear project to its owners. But they 
are now seen as the means by which a new breed of producer can get top dollar 
by sending power wherever prices are highest.
?????"It used to be generating capacity was built by people who looked at the 
market to see if they could meet demand," said Jack Davis, president of 
Pinnacle West Capital Corp., which owns Arizona's major utility and is 
putting up two of the Wintersburg plants.
?????"Now," he said approvingly, "it's being built by people who look at the 
market to see if you can make a lot of money."

?????Plans Go Awry in Many States
?????Money, not the watchful eye of government, was what was supposed to 
assure that electricity deregulation worked. The opportunity to make it would 
cause investors to flock to the electricity business, ensuring that plenty of 
new power plants got built.
?????If too many went up, it would be investors, not ratepayers, who 
suffered. If too few, then high prices would attract still more investors, 
more plants and, ultimately, more power.
?????But to date, almost nothing about deregulation has gone as planned--and 
not just in California, but in the West in general.
?????Take Arizona. The state has a hands-off attitude toward business, 
including its utilities. It has almost none of the environmental restrictions 
blamed for keeping California from putting up the new plants it needs.
?????Its population grew by 40% from 1990 to 2000, according to the Census 
Bureau. And its demand for electricity expanded at nearly twice that rate, 
according to industry figures.
?????"Arizona should have been a power producer's heaven," said A. Michael 
Schaal, a senior analyst with Energy Ventures Analysis Inc., a prominent 
Washington-area consulting firm.
?????But Arizona's power production rose a mere 4% during the 1990s, mostly 
as a result of improving existing plants. Until 18 months ago, no one had 
applied to build a major power plant since Palo Verde in the late 1980s.
?????"I guess I go on the assumption that the utilities plan with some sort 
of 10-, 20-, 30-year time horizon," Arizona's Republican Gov. Jane Dee Hull 
said in a recent interview. "I think what we all worry about is: Are they 
planning?"
?????Or Nevada. Its utilities apparently did plan and increased 
electricity-making capacity between 1990 and 2000 by a substantial 44%. But 
that wasn't enough to keep up with the state's population, which increased 
66%. On Thursday, Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn, a Republican and former energy 
company executive, indefinitely halted deregulation in his state.
?????Or traditionally energy-rich Washington state. One of its major 
utilities, Seattle City Light, recently learned that all of its previously 
planned supply increase for the next four years will be consumed, and then 
some, by just three new customers: computer server farms being built to 
handle the growing Internet traffic in and out of the high-tech capital.
?????But it's unlikely to be able to get extra power soon because regional 
supplies are balanced on a "razor's edge," according to Northwest Power Pool 
President Jerry Rust. "We have no cushion."
?????Indeed, the electricity supplies of the entire West are balanced on a 
razor's edge, with a variety of forecasters predicting serious shortages this 
summer.
?????Schaal, the Washington-area consultant, for example, said the region 
will come up 6% short. "Westerners can expect 150 to 275 hours of rolling 
blackouts, most of them in California," he said.
?????One of the most striking aspects of the current situation is that, in 
contrast to what most people think, supplies have not grown short just 
recently.
?????They have been perilously tight for the last several years--before the 
start of California's troubles of this summer and fall, and before the 
near-record dry winter that has left the Northwest dangerously short of water 
for its hydroelectric dams.
?????The implication is that California did not cause other states to run 
short of power so much as trigger events that exposed their danger. It did 
that, according to key observers, with one monumentally inept maneuver.
?????When California required its major utilities to buy power in the 
volatile spot market and simultaneously prohibited them from passing along 
higher costs to consumers, it set off a furious price spiral.
?????That effectively stripped the entire region of its energy security 
blanket, the assurance that it could buy extra power relatively inexpensively 
if local supplies proved inadequate.
?????The result has been a string of crises across the West.
?????In southern Arizona, for example, the San Carlos Irrigation Project, a 
tiny public utility that tried to jump into the deregulation vanguard by 
dropping long-term contracts in hopes of more power at lower prices in the 
spot market, has announced that its bills are going up 300%. Most of the 
project's 13,300 poor customers say they can't pay.
?????In Phoenix, utility executives who had confidently said the state was 
rich with new power projects about to come on line have decided to pull two 
50-year-old steam plants out of mothballs and rent a pair of portable 
generators to reduce purchases from the expensive spot market.
?????In Idaho, the big power company is appealing to potato farmers to skip 
planting and sell the electricity they would use running irrigation pumps 
back to the firm. Company executives figure the buyback will be cheaper than 
purchasing power on the open market--and the potato farmers are likely to do 
pretty well themselves.

?????Deep Hostility in Rest of the West
?????The subtle difference between California's triggering recent events and 
actually causing the region's crisis is largely lost in the current 
atmosphere of apprehension and upheaval. Although leaders of the rest of the 
West are scrupulously evenhanded in commenting to outsiders about their big 
neighbor, they are less guarded at home.
?????The normally mild-mannered Leavitt, for example, was recently quoted as 
warning a Salt Lake City audience that "California, if given the chance, 
would put a shunt into our veins and bleed us pretty quickly." (In an 
interview, he denied having made the remark.)
?????Such comments reflect an old and easily rekindled view among Westerners 
that their states are, in the words of historian Bernard DeVoto, "plundered 
provinces"--terrain that first Easterners and then Californians have 
regularly raided for minerals, water and, most recently, power.
?????But this time, some Western leaders think they can change all this. "A 
lot of people see an opportunity to rewrite the fundamental relationship with 
California to their advantage," said Stanford historian Richard White.
?????The attempts at rewriting are taking shape across the West.
?????In the Northwest, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana are redoubling 
their efforts to take over the Bonneville Power Administration, the huge, 
federally controlled generating system on the Columbia and Snake rivers that 
is one of California's chief sources of summer electricity. 
?????"The crisis has highlighted the danger that power generated in the 
region can be exported without the region's consent," Oregon Gov. John 
Kitzhaber said in an interview.
?????In Arizona, state officials have gone from having no proposals for new 
power plants to being buried by them. Regulators recently approved the 
construction of 10 plants, including several around Palo Verde, and are 
considering another eight.
?????Although they are requiring the plants to temporarily serve Arizona's 
needs first, the facilities will soon be able to sell their power for 
whatever prices they can command, an arrangement that could leave California 
just one among many bidders.
?????(Federal officials are unlikely to get in the way: Gov. Hull is close to 
President Bush, who in turn has shown little interest in helping Democratic 
California.)
?????Perhaps the most aggressive efforts at change are occurring in Utah, 
where Leavitt is trying something that could become California's worst 
nightmare--recalling power that Utah produces for the state.
?????Los Angeles' DWP and several other California utilities own 
three-quarters of the huge, coal-fired Intermountain Power Project in 
west-central Utah, and have been drawing on it without incident for 15 years.
?????But Utah officials recently unearthed a long-forgotten provision in 
their agreement with the plant's owners that gives them the right, with 
proper notice, to recall power for local use.
?????The state has already notified Los Angeles that it is taking back 50 
megawatts of electricity capacity this summer and another 170 next summer, 
and it may be able to take back still more, according to plant general 
manager Reed Searle.
?????Although the amounts are trivial--the Los Angeles utility either owns or 
has firm contracts for more than 7,000 megawatts of capacity--Leavitt said 
Utah will demand similar recall provisions in agreements for any new plants 
in the state, including a 500- to 750-megawatt facility that Los Angeles is 
negotiating to build.
?????"California has chosen not to create its own power generation and has 
depended on us to do that," the Utah governor said. "That's fine and we're 
willing to do that.
?????"But," he added, "there comes a point at which, if demand grows too 
large, we've got to hold some of this capacity back for ourselves, and for 
our children and grandchildren."
?????If Utah and the rest of the West have reached that point, California 
could be in for a much bigger and more enduring shock than the one from which

Plant Construction Stalled Over State's Effort to Revise Contracts 

Power: Small "peaker" generators could help California get through the summer 
without blackouts. 

By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer 

?????SACRAMENTO--The construction of a fleet of small power plants--capable 
of supplying 1 million homes--is being stalled because of a dispute between 
state officials and the plant builders.
?????Two weeks ago, Gov. Gray Davis toured a power plant under construction 
among the orchards of Sutter County. He ordered state Energy Commission 
regulators to roll out the red carpet for anybody willing to quickly build 
small, sometimes temporary, generators called "peakers" to help the state get 
through next summer without blackouts.
?????Yet plans for 29 such plants, which have been in the works since last 
fall, have been slowed by the state, according to the companies hired to 
build the plants. The problem, they say, is that the California Department of 
Water Resources, which was pushed into the electricity business on an 
emergency basis last month, is trying to amend 4-month-old contracts for 
construction of peaker plants.
?????State officials say the original contracts gave too much to the plant 
builders, and they want to save the taxpayers money by revising the terms.
?????"We're not delaying any construction," said Davis spokesman Phil 
Trounstine. "We're providing financial assurances for the generators and 
protections for California consumers."
?????"There's no reason," he added, "that these guys can't rework these 
contracts and get these plants up and running on time."
?????But peaker plant operators say the contract revisions probably will slow 
down construction. 
?????Last week, Harold Dittmer found out that the department wants to stretch 
to 10 years the terms of what had been a three-year contract with his 
company, Sacramento-based Wellhead Power.
?????He said he is scrambling to alter land and equipment leases and isn't 
certain he will get his four power plants installed in the Central Valley by 
the target dates of May and July.
?????"Having to renegotiate the agreements adds uncertainty, and uncertainty 
adds time," Dittmer said.
?????Some of the other eight companies with contracts to build peakers say 
they've also been asked to alter their contracts.
?????"The projects will not be done in June, as originally contemplated," 
said Dale Fredericks, chief executive officer of DG Power Inc. in the San 
Francisco suburb of Walnut Creek. His company intends to build seven small 
plants around the state with the combined capacity to supply more than 
340,000 homes.
?????These gas-fired plants, some so small they fit on the back of a big-rig 
truck, are designed to run a few hours at times of heightened demand. Most 
are slated for construction on existing industrial sites, such as utility 
substations.
?????Officials of the Department of Water Resources did not return calls for 
comment. Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Davis, said department officials are 
confident that the plants will all be finished this summer. He said the 
agency--thrust into the power-buying business as a result of the 
near-bankruptcy of the state's two biggest utilities--wants to amend the 
original contracts to save money.
?????"We're simply trying to get the best prices for taxpayers," Maviglio 
said.
?????But in slowing down the plant construction, the department's action 
undermines the governor's campaign to quickly expand the state's power 
production. Two weeks ago, Davis ordered the Energy Commission to offer 
licensing of such plants in 21 days or less. On Wednesday, the commission 
published a list of 32 sites around the state that could, by its estimation, 
quickly and easily accommodate a peaker plant.
?????Among these sites, targeted for proximity to transmission lines and 
natural gas supplies, are an airport in Kern County, the port of Long Beach 
and a cardboard recycling plant in Ontario.
?????"Our target is 1,000 megawatts," said Energy Commission spokeswoman 
Claudia Chandler.
?????Fredericks, the power plant builder, said the state's best shot of 
getting that much peaking power built by this summer is through existing 
contracts like his. So many plants are under construction around the country 
that there is often a long wait for delivery of the turbines, compressors and 
other crucial components of a power plant, he said.
?????"We've been working on this six months, so we have equipment lined up," 
said Fredericks, who searched worldwide for the parts he needed. "But 
somebody coming in right now probably can't find the equipment."
?????His company and eight others signed contracts last fall with the 
California Independent System Operator. That nonprofit agency, based east of 
Sacramento in Folsom, was established under the state's 1996 deregulation 
plan to balance the flow of electricity on the transmission grid reaching 75% 
of California.
?????Typically, Cal-ISO wouldn't be in the business of soliciting 
construction of power plants. But a scarcity of supply complicates Cal-ISO's 
job. Managers looking ahead to the summer of 2001 predicted last year that 
the state would be short of electricity by one-fifth of what it needs on 
those hottest afternoons when demand for power spikes upward.
?????Warning of "a very substantial risk" of rotating blackouts in the summer 
of 2001, Cal-ISO officials signed contracts last October and November for 29 
small power plants to be built by June. The plants would be capable of 
providing 1,279 megawatts of peak-time electricity--enough to supply more 
than 1 million homes--at a cost of $214 million a year for three years.
?????That would amount to about $6 per California household per year, Cal-ISO 
staff figured.
?????"These costs," wrote Cal-ISO management in a memo to its policy-making 
board of governors, "should be weighed against the financial, social and 
human costs" associated with blackouts.
?????"We saw the summer of 2001 coming like a freight train," said Brian 
Theaker, manager of reliability contracts at Cal-ISO. "And we gulped and 
swallowed and said, 'We've got to do this because nobody else is.' "
?????Those contracts were signed despite the misgivings of two appointees of 
the governor.
?????In an Oct. 26 letter, Public Utilities Commission Chairwoman Loretta 
Lynch and Michael Kahn, head of the Electricity Oversight Board, complained 
that the contracts for peaker plants seemed too expensive.
?????They urged Cal-ISO to refrain from signing the contracts until the PUC 
could check whether Edison and PG&E were willing to build the plants more 
cheaply.
?????But the utilities came forward with no such plans, and the Cal-ISO board 
approved the contracts.
?????Under those contracts, the plants would be required to produce 
electricity for 500 hours at most this summer, when called upon to do so by 
Cal-ISO.
?????But work on the plants tapered off in January, when the deteriorating 
financial condition of Edison and PG&E threw the future of Cal-ISO into 
jeopardy.
?????Cal-ISO doesn't actually buy electricity. It bills utilities for the 
power it needs to balance the grid. So as Edison and PG&E spiraled toward 
bankruptcy in December, Cal-ISO lost its credit-worthy status, and 
companies--and their lenders--feared doing business with the agency.
?????To calm those fears and to get construction underway, the Department of 
Water Resources has offered to replace Cal-ISO in the contracts. But that has 
not yet happened, as department officials seek to change the contracts. The 
state has hired a Massachusetts firm, Navigant, to renegotiate the deals.
?????"If DWR would just assume the contracts as they are, we'd all be in high 
gear," Dittmer said.

Electricity Crisis Dims Firms' Opinion of State 

Polling: Four out of 10 small companies are less happy about California's 
business climate, and 20% are looking at a move. 

By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writer 

?????Four out of 10 small companies say California's electricity crisis has 
dimmed their view of the state as a place to do business, and nearly two in 
10 are exploring a move to another state, according to a survey released 
Friday by the National Federation of Independent Business.
?????The survey, one of the first to attempt to 
?????gauge the toll on business from the energy meltdown, follows other polls 
issued this week that illuminate vastly different views of deregulation and 
the retail competition that it is intended to spark.
?????Most California consumers said they still favor electricity competition, 
in a survey conducted by J.D. Power & Associates. More than half of the 750 
people interviewed said they did not understand deregulation, but 64% said 
the state should continue to support competition in the electricity industry.
?????But another survey, by the Booz-Allen & Hamilton consulting firm, found 
that most commercial and industrial companies were "wholly unprepared" to 
take advantage of retail electricity competition around the nation and that 
few switched to new electricity providers. While most of those that switched 
saved money on their electricity bills, 10% paid the same or even more for 
power.
?????If nothing else, the three surveys underscore that problems in the 
electricity industry are confusing, expensive, frustrating and disruptive for 
all involved.
?????"This is a major issue, the No. 1 issue, for small business," said 
Martyn Hopper, state director for the National Federation of Independent 
Business, an advocacy group for small companies.
?????Although California businesses have raised serious concerns about both 
energy costs and supply, the state's economy so far has shown only limited 
damage.
?????Just more than 20% of respondents said they had been hit by blackouts 
since the beginning of the year, the telephone survey of 523 small businesses 
conducted for NFIB by Mason-Dixon Polling & Research of Maryland found.
?????But there clearly was some confusion among those answering the survey 
about whether these were the rotating blackouts that hit Northern and Central 
California on Jan. 17 and 18, or whether these were voluntary power outages 
under utility programs that ask businesses to cut electricity usage when 
supplies are extremely tight. For example, 9.4% of respondents in the Los 
Angeles area said they had experienced a blackout when no forced outages 
occurred south of Bakersfield.
?????For whatever reason the lights went out, more than half of the 
businesses were forced to severely curtail or terminate business operations 
for the entire blackout.
?????About one-third said they lost sales, nearly 21% said materials were 
damaged or destroyed, and nearly 40% had to absorb wage costs for work not 
done.
?????Businesses were almost evenly split on whether the blackouts would lower 
earnings, and nearly eight out of 10 were not planning any layoffs as a 
result.
?????But the electricity mess has damaged the companies' views of California 
as a secure business home. Slightly more than 43% said the power problem had 
changed their views about California as a place to do business, and nearly 
71% said it had shaken their confidence in the state's political and business 
leadership.
?????But a whopping 69% said they have no intention of moving their companies 
to another state.
?????"Our members don't have the option of moving to Texas or Colorado" in 
search of cheaper or more reliable power, Hopper said. "A lot of them are 
family owned and minority owned . . . and they want to do business in 
California."

NEWS ANALYSIS 
Once Accused of Inactivity, Davis Now Takes Lead Role 

The governor has shifted into campaign mode in the power crisis, trying to 
convince voters, critics and investors that he can steer the state toward 
recovery. 

By DAN MORAIN and RONE TEMPEST, Times Staff Writers 

?????Just a month ago, Gov. Gray Davis was under fire for failing to move 
quickly and forcefully to quell California's energy crisis.
?????But in recent weeks the governor has moved into campaign mode--touring 
power plants with TV cameras in tow and issuing a steady stream of 
proclamations that declare victories in the power battle.
?????His mission is to convince voters in California, analysts on Wall 
Street, and politicos across the country that he is up to solving what he 
insists on calling the energy "challenge."
?????Davis is doing what any politician on the hustings would do: Head out to 
a power plant under construction as he did recently, put on a hard hat and 
tell gathered reporters that he is working to make sure the state will have 
enough power to meet its needs.
?????"Because it is so complicated and hydra-headed," said Garry South, 
Davis' chief political consultant, "we really felt he had to move out and 
simplify and objectify what he is doing." Otherwise, people simply wouldn't 
see that he had a plan to solve the problem.
?????"This isn't rocket science," South added. "The communication tools and 
techniques that any elected official has" don't differ that much "from what 
is available in a campaign."
?????Davis arrived Friday night in Washington, D.C., on the first leg of a 
five-day East Coast trip that will take him to Wall Street. In recent weeks, 
he has compiled a story to tell of actions he has taken that suggest he is on 
top of the situation.
?????Critics counter that his plans are half measures. On Friday, for 
example, he did not announce a final deal to rescue the state's three private 
utilities from their multibillion dollar debt. Rather, he proclaimed that he 
had the framework of an accord with one of the utilities, Southern California 
Edison.
?????However, the goal is to show progress, even if it's incremental.
?????"The public just wants it solved," said Democratic political consultant 
Darry Sragow, who doesn't work for Davis. "He is working to show that he is 
working to solve the problem. If there is a view that no one is solving his 
problem, all hell will break loose."
?????The actions are a far cry from the situation in January, when utility 
executives, power generators and lawmakers were loudly blaming Davis for 
failing to recognize the power crisis and for not taking steps soon enough to 
get California on course for recovery.
?????Davis confidantes say there was no single event that led to the 
governor's decision to position himself as the man who would lead California 
out of the crisis. But the governor pays close attention to 
politics--conferring at least weekly with his team of political advisors and 
regularly scrutinizing public opinion polls.
?????After convening two focus groups on the topic last month, the governor 
and his political advisors, led by South, concluded that Davis needed to take 
a higher profile. The prospect of the state's two major utilities going broke 
also spurred the governor into action.
?????"It became important to let Wall Street, creditors, generators and the 
public understand that we were making progress." said Davis' communication 
director Phil Trounstine. "That's a big piece of why you've seen the governor 
personally carrying the message."
?????Davis still has critics, including many in his party. But few can say 
that he is still suffering from inaction. He is pushing for a state 
takeover--at a cost of more than $7 billion--of private utilities' electrical 
transmission systems, and spending money at a clip of $1 billion a month to 
buy electricity.
?????Flush with a multibillion budget surplus, the Davis administration has 
spent more than $2 billion to buy electricity so far. It is offering an extra 
$400 million for conservation measures, and pledges to spend millions more to 
speed construction of new power plants.
?????Aides say practical reasons prevented Davis from taking a more public 
role sooner. He was spending most of his time gaining an understanding of the 
problem, and looking for solutions.
?????Davis was freed up only after he assembled his energy team, led by 
former Edison executive Michael Peevey, San Francisco lawyer Michael Kahn, 
and Department of Water and Power chief S. David Freeman. The trio gave Davis 
the expertise to negotiate with utility executives and power generators.
?????Once they were in place, Davis had time to make public appearances, like 
the one in Yuba City earlier this month, themed around generation and power 
plant construction--the stuff of photo opportunities.
?????"It was a collective view that because this problem was so complicated 
and abstract, he had to move out," South said.
?????And of course, Davis' political future is widely seen to ride on the 
outcome.
?????Lawmakers give Davis credit for deflecting blame for the crisis from his 
office, even if it means they pay the price. But now that Davis has taken the 
lead role, he faces risks if the plan fails.
?????"I'm convinced, if it blows up, he is going to get the worst of it," 
said one senior Democrat.
?????Added Sragow: "We're not talking about anything that is particularly 
subtle or sophisticated. The governor is chief executive, the point person. 
If the person who is the obvious choice doesn't lead, there will be unrest, 
and someone will try to fill the vacuum."
?????Davis' efforts are beginning to result in some praise. A utility 
executive who a month ago was highly critical said after Davis announced the 
makings of a rescue plan for Edison that the governor "forged a difficult and 
creative and complex agreement.'
?????"I think you have to give him points for that," the executive said.
?????This story was reported by Dan Morain in Los Angeles and Rone Tempest in 
Sacramento.

			California has appetite for electricity, but is no power glutton

ANDREW BRIDGES, Associated Press Writer

			Monday,?February 26, 2001 
			Breaking News Sections 
			
			
			
			
			

			
			(02-26) 12:39 PST LOS ANGELES (AP) -- California's power crisis has led 
neighboring states to accuse the Golden State of hogging electricity. But the 
numbers tell a different story. 
			California does use a vast amount of electricity. But it consumes less on a 
per-capita basis than all other states except Rhode Island. 
			The mild climate and less heavy industry than other states are part of the 
reason. Experts say credit also must go to stringent conservation measures. 
			``It's true we're big, and it's true we didn't build a lot of power plants. 
... But we're not energy hogs at all,'' said Arthur Rosenfeld, who sits on 
the five-member California Energy Commission. ``We're almost as good as 
Western Europe, and Western Europe is about twice as energy-efficient as the 
United States.'' 
			Among the 50 states, only Texas consumes more energy -- measured by its total 
use of electricity, natural gas and oil -- than California, the nation's most 
populous state. 
			However, California ranks 47th in per-capita energy use -- well below No. 4 
Texas, No. 20 Washington and No. 27 Oregon, according to the Energy 
Information Administration, which is part of the U.S. Energy Department. 
			When looking specifically at per-capita electricity consumption, California 
ranks 49th, at 24.2 million BTUs, the agency said. Californians' per-capita 
electricity use is only 60 percent of the national average. 
			For air conditioning alone, a typical California household uses one-third the 
amount of electricity consumed by a household in Texas or Florida, according 
to the U.S. Energy Department's 1997 Residential Energy Consumption Survey. 
			California has ``a different climate, so even if you do have warm summers, 
they're not humid, so you don't have the big, huge air conditioning load you 
see in Florida or Texas,'' said Robert Latta, the survey's manager at the 
Energy Information Administration. 
			California also uses electricity, as well as natural gas, oil and coal, more 
wisely than most states thanks to aggressive conservation efforts started 
during the oil shocks of the early 1970s, federal and state data indicate. 
			Key to those efforts are stringent standards for new homes and commercial 
buildings that dictate such things as the types of windows and lighting and 
the amount of insulation. 
			``If it is not the leading state, they are at least tied for it'' in 
efficiency standards, said Ed Wisniewski, deputy director of the Boston-based 
Consortium for Energy Efficiency. ``Historically, they have been very 
progressive, and many of the programs we advocate nationally were started in 
California.'' 
			California's per-capita use also is lower because many energy-intensive 
industries are located elsewhere. Aluminum smelting and paper manufacturing, 
for example, are clustered in the Pacific Northwest. 
			The industries that are located in California, however, are generally more 
efficient in their use of electricity than industries elsewhere, according to 
1998 figures from the California Energy Commission, which shapes state energy 
policy. 
			Companies use just 0.2 kilowatt-hours of electricity to produce every 
dollar's worth of goods and services in California, while businesses in 
neighboring states use twice as much, according to commission figures. 
			``The concept that California is a big, wasteful state really isn't true,'' 
said Latta, of the Energy Information Administration. 
			There is still room for improvement in California, particularly when it comes 
to conservation. California ranks just 17th among all states in spending by 
utilities on energy-efficiency programs as part of their revenue. 
			In 1998, California utilities reduced spending on energy-efficiency programs, 
though the current crisis has prompted the major utilities to reverse that, 
according to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. 
			Gov. Gray Davis recently released a $404 million conservation program 
designed to control growth in the state's demand for electricity. 
			Maintaining energy efficiency and keeping demand in check as the population 
grows will be among the toughest challenges in the years ahead. 
			Energy use per capita is up 10 percent over the past two decades. 
Californians used about 7,000 kilowatt hours per year in 1980, compared with 
about 7,700 kilowatt hours last year, according to scientists at Lawrence 
Berkeley National Laboratory. 
			And many people are moving to inland areas where they find cheaper housing 
but also face more severe summer temperatures that require greater use of air 
conditioning.

USA: U.S. West spot power lower as plants return to service.
? 
02/26/2001 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 
LOS ANGELES, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Spot electricity prices in 
the U.S. West for Tuesday delivery were lower, weakened by the 
return to service of some key power plants and comparatively 
light loads across the region. 
Dealers noted the list of plants returning to service 
included the 750 megawatt Unit 1 at the Navajo coal-fired plant 
in Arizona, the 750 MW Unit 1 at the Ormond Beach gas-fired 
plant in southern California and the 739 MW Unit 6 at the Moss 
Landing gas-fired plant in northern California . 
Their return was offset by the start of a planned outage at 
the 750 MW Unit 3 at the Navajo plant and expectations that the 
739 MW Unit 7 at the Moss Landing gas-fired plant would be 
brought down shortly for a planned upgrade. 
There was also talk that the 508 MW Boardman coal-fired 
plant in Oregon had tripped off line over the weekend although 
market sources said they believed the unit was back up on 
Monday morning. 
Loads were reduced by generally mild daytime temperatures 
across the region although cold nights boosted offpeak demand. 
The California Independent System Operator (ISO) forecast 
loads on the 75 percent of the state grid it oversees would 
peak Tuesday at 29,285 MW, down from an expected peak on Monday 
of 29,814 MW. 
Natural gas prices were steady to slightly higher with a 
range of $12.00-14.00 per million British thermal units 
compared with an average on Friday of $12.25. 
Gas fuels about a third of California 's power plants. 
Weather Services Corp. forecast Northwest temperatures 
would be mostly 2-4 degrees F below normal through Tuesday, 
near normal Wednesday and near normal to 10 degrees above on 
Thursday and Friday. 
Southwest temperatures were seen averaging 3-12 degrees 
below on Tuesday, 2-8 degrees below on Wednesday, near normal 
to 4 degrees above on Thursday and near normal to 8 degrees 
above on Friday.

Calif Pwr Plan May Face Stumbling Blocks In Legislature
By Jason Leopold
? 
02/26/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
   
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Key lawmakers in the California Assembly and Senate 
on Monday were only willing to offer partial support for a plan by Gov. Gray 
Davis to buy the power lines owned by the state's three investor-owned 
utilities. 
Their hesitance calls into question the chances of quick passage for the 
measure, which is the centerpiece of the governor's plan to keep the state's 
two largest utilities from sliding into bankruptcy. 
"There are way too many unanswered questions about it, both fundamental and 
logistical questions," said the chief of staff to one key Democratic 
lawmaker. 
On Friday, Gov. Davis announced at a news conference that he reached an 
"agreement in principle" with Edison International (EIX) unit Southern 
California Edison to purchase the utility's transmission lines for $2.76 
billion, roughly 2.3 times their book value. 
Davis said he hopes to finalize the deal by Friday, when he also hopes to 
announce similar deals for Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric 
and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric . 
Davis aides said the state is willing to pay about $7.5 billion for the 
26,000 miles of transmission lines owned by the three utilities. 
The buyout is aimed to restore the utilities to solvency and help them 
restructure nearly $13 billion in undercollected power costs the companies 
have amassed during 2000. 
But lawmakers said the measure won't sail through the Legislature. State Sen. 
Debra Bowen, D-Redondo Beach, who chairs the Senate Energy Committee, said 
she isn't willing to sign off on the transmission plan until the state 
secures concessions from generators and other creditors. She also questioned 
the price the governor has offered for the power lines. 
"There are a number of advantages to having the state own and control the 
transmission lines, but it's not something we should do at any price," Bowen 
said, adding that the deal should also have value to ratepayers. 
For the past several weeks, key lawmakers Bowen, Assembly Speaker Robert 
Hertzberg, Assemblyman Fred Keely, Senate leader John Burton and Assembly 
Republican Minority leader Bill Campbell, the Democratic and Republican 
lawmakers who have stood with Davis during previous news conferences, have 
been missing. 
Advisers said the lawmakers have decided not to endorse Davis' plan until 
more information has been released. Sen. Burton, who introduced legislation 
three weeks ago to have the state purchase the utilities' transmission lines, 
also wouldn't declare his support for the governor's plan. 
"As the governor noted, this is an agreement in principle, and the 
Legislature awaits further details," said Burton press secretary Dave Sebeck. 
Other Democrats refused to comment on the transmission plan, while 
Republicans have been the most vocal opponents. 
"I don't see how we can pay for the transmission lines without a rate 
increase," Campbell said. "If you refinance your house from a $100,000 
mortgage to a $230,000 mortgage, you're going to have to pay more. That's a 
simple fact. 
Consumer groups have blasted the governor's proposal, likening it to a 
bailout of the utilities. 
Michael Shames, executive director of the Utilities Consumer Action Network, 
said the price the state is offering to pay for Southern California Edison's 
power lines "is the outer limits of what can be financially justified as a 
purchase price for the transmission." 
Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, said he 
will try and overturn the measure with an initiative on the 2002 ballot. 
But Davis isn't worried by his critics, whether they be Democrat or 
Republican. 
"Responsible Democrats and Republicans will vote for this," said Steve 
Maviglio, press secretary to Davis.

There were several items in the mail pouch that you needed a response form me 
on.  Here are the responses:

Marchris forwarded a request to attend a conference on Aug 19 and 20.  I 
think the original invite when to Ken and Jeff.  I will attend, subject to 
them getting some reasonable response rate from the commissioners they 
invited and provided that I get a speaking or similar participation 
opportunity.

I'm afraide this leaves too much room to manuever.  Having duties related to 
setting legislative affairs strategy and developing a plan for contacts on 
the Hill, will give Cynthia the idea that she can run all aspects of those 
duties, not just those related specifically to her substantive area.  I think 
it is also worth covering the heavy emphasis on teamwork and supporting, 
rather than directing, others in the organization.

I am attaching several items that I hope you will find useful when you brief 
Chambers:


A background document (which is a bit dated, but still useful). This is an 
internal document, so I would appreciate it if you would keep it confidential 
(though you are free to use the content in your own messages or documents).
A basic outline of solutions.
A summary of the Governor's recent executive orders. (It's another internal 
analysis.) I think these orders show a better understanding of the problems 
and solutions than we have seen before.  As we discussed on the phone, our 
biggest problem is inertia ... we don't have much time, many solutions have 
long lead times, and the political wheels grind slowly.

Jeff Dasovich: please forward any specifics on the demand buy down proposal 
and anything else that you think might be helpful background for Laura.

I would like to explore how the DC Office can plug in on the advance planning 
of Ken's DC trips.  As we get things organized here I want to do a better job 
of maximizing the use of our corporate execs when they are in town.  This is 
hard to do without some advance notice of travel arrangements.  I do not want 
to be intrusive but I do think we can bring added value to Enron's presence 
in DC.  What most immediately brings this to mind is that I learned from news 
sources today that Ken is giving a speech (participating via panel) at the 
Club for Growth's event tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. in Senate Dirksen.   We 
have been busily planning all of Enron executives' trips to the inaugural and 
I thought I had something of a handle on each executive's itinerary.  So this 
came as a surprise.  A second  problem with this is that it is being hosted 
by Craig Shirley Associates.  I am told by Cynthia that Craig Shirley Assoc. 
is the group that last year hired private investigators to ferret out our 
tactics and strategies on electric restructuring.  Ken may not know this 
relationship.  Some vetting of the invite might have brought this to his 
attention.  I appreciate your thoughts on this and how I can most effectively 
add our input.  Thanks.

  Metropolitan Desk; Section B 
  Debate on Need for New Power Plants Ignores Conservation 
  By KIRK JOHNSON 
    
  09/26/2000 
  The New York Times 
  Page 1, Column 2 
  c. 2000 New York Times Company 

  New Yorkers heard a lot this summer about why their electricity bills were 
going up and
  why a new generation of power plants was needed, and the message centered 
on one
  word: demand.

  Millions of new air-conditioners, computers and other gadgets are humming, 
blinking and
  draining electricity from the power pool, utility executives and state 
energy officials said
  over and over again. The 40 percent jump in electricity rates that many in 
the region were
  assessed in August was only a hint of what could lie ahead, those officials 
suggested, if
  residents did not accept more power plants in their neighborhoods.

  What the public was not told was that the people framing the argument for 
building power
  plants have an abiding interest in selling more electricity. Nor was the 
public told that the
  means already existed to dampen demand and reduce the amount of new power 
needed, if
  the political will could be exerted.

  Before New York's energy markets were deregulated, beginning in 1998, the 
state required
  companies like Consolidated Edison to reduce demand in the system -- 
through energy
  efficiency measures, for example -- if that choice was cheaper than 
building a new plant.

  Under deregulation , that requirement has been lost. In an open market, 
every participant
  wants to sell more energy, and the government agencies in New York and other
  deregulated states that once compelled companies to think of alternatives 
have become
  silent or powerless.

  ''The reliability problems and price spikes in the last two years have led 
to a simplistic set
  of solutions: build more power plants,'' said Richard Cowart, director of 
the Regulatory
  Assistance Project, a nonprofit energy policy institute in Montpelier, Vt., 
that works with
  state regulators and utilities.

  On the new playing field, Mr. Cowart and other experts said, the incentives 
are all
  one-sided.

  Power generating companies have no motive to encourage people to use less 
energy or to
  use it more efficiently because the most money is to be made when demand is 
at its peak.
  And electricity delivery companies make more money by sending more 
electricity through
  their wires. ''The incentive to sell more electricity is overwhelming,'' 
Mr. Cowart said.

  Certainly, demand for electricity is rising in New York and across the 
country, and most
  experts agree that some added generating capacity is needed. And New York 
State's top
  electricity official, Maureen O. Helmer, chairwoman of the Public Service 
Commission, has
  emphasized in her recent speeches that conservation and efficiency measures 
must be
  part of the solution to rising demand.

  The problem, environmental groups and energy analysts say, is that in an 
arena in which
  government has taken a step back through deregulation , it is harder for 
regulators to
  make those opinions count.

  Given the tone of the debate in New York and the sharp jump in prices this 
summer, it
  would be easy for the public to think that the region's energy situation is 
worse than it
  actually is. Most long-term projections for the region say that demand will 
increase less in
  New York State and New York City than in the nation as a whole during the 
next 10 to 15
  years. New York, it turns out, is not an energy hog.

  The most recent official long-term projection for New York, called the 
State Energy Plan,
  issued in late 1998, said the state could get by with only a very modest 
expansion in
  generating capacity for the next 10 years, or no expansion at all if the 
levels of electricity
  that utilities are required to hold in reserve could be modified.

  The rate of growth in demand is also slowing down, not accelerating. Within 
the territory
  served by Consolidated Edison, which includes all of New York City and its 
northern
  suburbs, peak demand, the highest single moment of energy use on the 
heaviest day of the
  year, rose by 1.7 percent a year from the mid-1990's to the end of the 
decade. In the new
  century, that growth rate is expected to be 1.2 percent a year.

  ''It will be more modest,'' one senior Con Ed official said.

  The main implication of those projections, economists and energy analysts 
say, is that
  most of the increased capacity proposed for New York City may not be needed 
at all, at
  least to meet new demand. In the Con Ed service area, meeting a 1.2 percent 
growth in
  demand through new supply alone would require an increased capacity of 500 
to 750
  megawatts over the next five years. Developers and power plant builders 
have proposed a
  total increase six to eight times greater than that in the next three years 
alone.

  ''No one plant can make the argument that it's really needed,'' said Ashok 
Gupta, an energy
  economist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private conservation 
group. ''Like
  malls, power plants are now being built for market share.''

  Predicting energy demand is notoriously difficult. In the early 1970's, for 
example, the
  accepted wisdom was that energy use would continue to grow at the rapid 
pace that it had
  in the 1960's. Academics and utility industry officials said the country 
might need 1,000
  nuclear plants by the turn of the century.

  But the oil shocks of the mid-1970's and early 1980's forced the 
introduction of
  energy-efficiency measures that made those forecasts worthless. Energy use 
as a
  percentage of the nation's economy, called energy intensity, began 
declining and has done
  so ever since.

  Some energy officials have said the problem of rising prices and the 
overwhelming focus on
  supply is the result of a still-new electricity market that is not yet 
functioning as intended.

  Theorists who had envisioned competition as the door to a golden age of 
consumer choice
  had predicted that companies specializing in demand reduction -- they sell 
ways to cut
  energy use through technology or better management -- would compete with 
companies
  selling supply. But that has not happened yet. Part of Con Ed's prediction 
of more modest
  growth in demand in coming years is based on the expectation that 
demand-management
  companies will emerge within the next few years, company officials said.

  But state regulatory officials also made the political decision in the late 
1990's to reduce
  spending for conservation and efficiency measures. The state, which once 
led the region in
  financing for alternatives to new supply -- an effort that included 
television commercials
  urging people to think about saving energy -- now spends about a third as 
much per capita
  as most states in the Northeast, including Connecticut and New Jersey, 
according to
  figures from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.

  Last month, a report filed with the State Public Service Commission 
recommended an
  increase in financing for the efficiency program. The report was produced 
by representatives
  of the electricity industry, working alongside consumer and environmental 
groups. But the
  state's utilities, including New York State Electric and Gas, Niagara 
Mohawk and Con Ed,
  refused to support the final report because they were unhappy with its 
conclusions.

  '' Deregulation undermined the role of utilities in promoting energy 
efficiency,'' said Edward
  A. Smeloff, the executive director of the Pace Law School Energy Project, a 
research and
  advocacy group that helped write the report. As electricity companies have 
become more
  conscious of the bottom line under deregulation , Mr. Smeloff said, 
demand-reduction
  programs have become a threat to profits.

  For utilities that buy most of their power from other companies, moving 
more electricity
  through the wires has become the primary way to increase profits, Mr. 
Smeloff said. ''That's
  the business,'' he added.

  Utility officials say that much of their demand problems come down to one 
hour each year,
  that moment of peak demand when consumers are using the most electricity. 
To a great
  degree, planning revolves around the need to have adequate supply for that 
crucial moment
  so as to avoid blackouts. But experts like Mr. Smeloff say the tools 
already exist to
  dampen those peaks, and reduce prices to consumers as well, if only a 
constituency
  existed to push for the changes.

  Many business and residential energy uses are routine and could be 
postponed for a few
  hours to dampen load on peak days, a plan that efficiency experts say would 
be particularly
  easy in New York City commercial buildings where energy use is centrally 
controlled and
  monitored. In England, one electricity provider created lower rates for 
consumers who ran
  appliances like washing machines and dishwashers in off-peak hours. The 
program became
  so popular that power use in the middle of the night went up significantly 
during the
  discount-pricing window.

  Environmentalists also worry that increasing power capacity beyond the real 
demand in
  New York could create a kind of self-fueling spiral. If too many new plants 
are built, they
  say, prices will probably fall, encouraging people to use more electricity, 
while at the same
  time reducing incentives to save energy or use more efficient products.

  In New York and elsewhere in the country, much of the growth in demand is 
being driven by
  the spread of air-conditioning, especially from people buying extra units 
to cool more parts
  of their homes. Last year, Con Ed began a kind of visual history project in 
which employees
  began regularly photographing 90 apartment buildings in New York City and 
counting the
  number of window air-conditioners. In one year, the total went up by 5 
percent.

  Some energy experts say more air-conditioning could further increase the 
spurts in demand
  that could in turn lead to more power plants, which many scientists say are 
prime sources
  of the greenhouse gases blamed for global warming.

  ''We have hotter summers because of greenhouse gases and more greenhouse 
gases

director of the Center

Virginia. ''It would
  certainly be ironic if people decided that the solution was more power 
plants.''

Briefs: City and state 
Enron strategy officer named vice chairman
Enron Corp. said Wednesday that J. Clifford Baxter, its chief strategy 
officer since June, has been promoted to vice chairman. 
Baxter is a key member of the team that built Enron's successful wholesale 
energy business, said Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay. The promotion will help 
enhance that business. 
Baxter joined Enron in 1991. He was chairman and chief executive officer of 
Enron North America before being named chief strategy officer, a position 
that he keeps. Enron already has one vice chairman, Joseph Sutton, whose 
focus is operations.

Businesses feel strains of political 'shakedown' 
By KAREN MASTERSON 
Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau 
WASHINGTON -- Business executives are being tapped for record amounts of 
money to support political campaigns and are tired of what one calls the 
"shakedown" by candidates and their parties, according to two studies 
released Wednesday. 
Nearly $256 million has been raised in so-called soft money -- unlimited 
contributions from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals to political 
action committees. 
That figure is five times the amount of soft money raised in the presidential 
election year of 1992, according to the Federal Election Commission. 
A poll of businesses released Wednesday shows that the pressure put on 
corporate executives to make large contributions is creating a backlash that 
could lead to reform next year in Congress. 
The study reveals that 75 percent of corporate heads feel pressure to give; 
half said they fear repercussions if they turn down requests for money; and, 
consequently, 60 percent support a ban on soft money. 
Overall contributions -- for spending on both campaigns and issue ads -- have 
surpassed those made during the 1996 campaigns for president, the House and 
the Senate by $430 million. This election cycle's total, now at $1.6 billion, 
reflects contributions made in the 18 months leading up to June 30. 
Those against the influence of money on politics worry most that much more is 
to come. Their estimates put total campaign contributions up to $3 billion -- 
more than the total budget of many small countries -- once the remaining 
months of this year are accounted for. 
"Even before this election season began, we knew that the 2000 election was 
going to be one for the record books," said Larry Makinson, executive 
director of Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group that watches 
campaign contributions and their influence on policy. 
A lot is at stake this year, including the White House and control of the 
House, where Republicans hold a narrow majority. Democrats also hope to 
recover at least a few seats in the Senate. 
The center's analysis of FEC records shows that the computer industry leaped 
from a rank of 55 in campaign giving in 1990 to eighth place this year, 
providing $25 million in nearly equal amounts to Democrats and Republicans. 
"By splitting their money, the industry has gotten just about everything it's 
asked for from Congress," Makinson said. Among those requests are a 
moratorium on an Internet sales tax and an increase in immigration visas for 
high-tech job applicants. 
Efforts to ban soft money have been made on Capitol Hill, but have gone 
nowhere. And the two presidential candidates who made a soft-money ban 
central to their campaigns -- Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and former Sen. Bill 
Bradley, D-N.J. -- lost their primary election bids. 
Advocates of a total ban hope the business survey means executives are ready 
to act against the status quo. 
"I remember $5,000 and $10,000 contributions in soft money," said Harry 
Freeman, a former executive vice president of American Express Co., a 
position he held until 1990. Now he said executives are asked for $100,000 
and $200,000. 
And some executives see the practice as anti-competitive, Freeman said, 
because significant resources are going into political campaigns instead of 
being reinvested in a company's ability to compete in the marketplace. 
"Some are fascinated by politicians and think it's a big ideological thing to 
contribute. But the poll shows most people see it as a shakedown," said 
Freeman, who is currently a trustee of the Committee for Economic 
Development, a pro-business public policy institute that favors campaign 
finance overhaul and is supported by officials at Hasbro, Genesco, PP&L Inc. 
and other companies. 
The center commissioned the business survey, which included a random sample 
of 300 corporate executives. 
Soft money allows politicians and political committees to ask for huge sums 
of money, way beyond the limits placed on so-called hard money, which is 
capped and controlled by the Federal Election Commission. 
Because of soft money, "the message to donors is forget the limits," Makinson 
said Wednesday at a Center for Responsive Politics news conference. 
He said the ballooning of campaign contributions is backed by a recent 
federal court order that found the FEC limits on issue-ad spending were 
applicable if the advertisement blatantly promoted one candidate and included 
the term "vote for ... " 
But Makinson said only 3 percent of television ads fall into that narrowly 
defined category. This is a "messy area" that Congress sooner or later will 
have to deal with, he said. 
Both hard and soft money raised for the presidential campaign, including 
individual and party contributions, is up 45 percent, from $230.9 million in 
1996 to $335.1 million in 2000. Congressional campaign contributions have 
increased 45 percent in the same time period, from $271.8 million to $393 
million. And Senate campaigns have gone up 64 percent, from $158 million to 
$259.7 million, mainly because of hugely expensive races in New York and New 
Jersey. 
Texans alone gave more than $71 million in campaign contributions, with 73 
percent going to Republicans. Texas ranks fourth in campaign contributions, 
behind California, New York and the District of Columbia, according to the 
center's analysis. 
Among those to make the center's list of top 50 individual donors is 
Houstonian Kenneth Lay, who runs Enron and is a longtime supporter and family 
friend of former President George Bush. He gave more than $361,000, almost 
exclusively to Republicans. 
Sam Wyly, another Texan, gave Republicans more than $327,000. He is an 
investor who ran a special interest group that criticized McCain during the 
primaries. 
Two Texas congressmen raised among the largest pools of money for use in 
boosting other candidates' campaigns. House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Sugar 
Land, distributed $640,462. House Majority Leader Dick Armey,R-Irving, gave 
away $521,099, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

Renaming the Dome? Rely on it 
By ERIC BERGER 
Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Reliant Energy is expected to pay about $300 million to splash its name 
across the new football stadium and Astrodome complex, by far the most ever 
for a sports facility's name. 
Although negotiators said Wednesday that the naming rights agreement was not 
yet signed, they said talks were "feverish" and that a formal announcement is 
likely next week. 
Under the proposed agreement, outlined by sources close to the talks, Reliant 
would pay about $9 million a year to name the $367 million football stadium 
being built for the Houston Texans. The energy company would pay an 
additional $750,000 to secure naming rights for the entire Astrodome complex, 
including the Dome, the AstroArena and a new exposition center. 
The deal, expected to include a stadium suite for Reliant, extensive 
advertising throughout the facility and rides on the team plane for company 
executives, would run for 30 years. 
Reliant's bid comes the same year that Enron Field opened in downtown Houston 
bearing the name of a chief local competitor, Enron Corp. 
Both energy utilities have eyed naming rights as valuable promotional tools 
to boost their profiles as electricity deregulation looms in Texas and around 
the country. 
The Reliant deal also comes on the heels of an 11 percent rate increase by 
the company's HL&P unit in August and a proposed 11 percent increase by 
December to offset rising fuel costs. 
If signed, the agreement would be the most lucrative naming rights deal ever, 
both in total dollars and number of years. 
About a year ago, FedEx agreed to pay $205 million over 27 years to name the 
Washington Redskins' football stadium, the largest deal to date in total 
dollars. And in February 1999, Royal Philips Electronics agreed to pay about 
$9 million a year for 20 years to name the home of the Atlanta Hawks 
basketball team and Thrashers hockey team -- the largest annual sum to date. 
Officials with the Houston Texans, owned by Bob McNair, steadfastly denied a 
deal had been signed. 
"A deal is not in place. We continue to have discussions," said Jamey Rootes, 
senior vice president of marketing for the Texans. 
However, another team source -- speaking on condition of anonymity -- 
confirmed that the $10 million annual figure was accurate and that Reliant 
had beat out Dynegy, whose chairman, Chuck Watson, owns a minority share of 
the football team. 
The Houston stadium is particularly valuable because of its rodeo ties and 
the likelihood it will host multiple Super Bowls, said Jeff Knapple, 
president and chief executive officer of Envision, a Los Angeles-based 
consulting company. Houston is all but guaranteed to host the 2004 Super 
Bowl. 
The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo draws 2 million visitors a year, and the 
name of a stadium hosting a Super Bowl is heard by an estimated 1 billion 
people around the world on Super Bowl Sunday. 
As part of the stadium financing deal, the Texans will receive 83 percent of 
the money paid for the stadium's naming rights, with the facility's other 
main tenant, the rodeo, receiving 12 percent. 
Harris County, which owns the Astrodome complex, will receive the remaining 5 
percent of the stadium naming rights fee, and all of the $750,000 yearly 
payment for the rights to the rest of the complex. If Reliant is chosen, the 
county also would receive $400,000 a year for giving the energy company the 
exclusive right to provide power. 
The football stadium is scheduled to open in August 2002, at which time the 
Astrodome would have no tenants. Although Harris County Judge Robert Eckels 
has ruled out tearing down the Dome, the county has not decided what to do 
with the building. 
Although the naming rights deal encompasses the Astrodome and AstroArena, the 
rights to those buildings could be resold if they are refurbished for 
different purposes, two county sources said. 
If the county were to build a new arena at the complex, Reliant would be 
given the first option to bid on the name. 
It was only three years ago that Compaq Computer Corp. scored what now 
appears a bargain, spending $5.4 million to rename The Summit for eight 
years. 
Since then the value of naming rights has skyrocketed as dotcoms, technology 
companies, insurance vendors and utilities have scrambled to achieve name 
recognition in an increasingly cluttered media world. 
Only a couple of years after Compaq's deal, Enron paid $100 million over 30 
years to name the downtown ballpark. 
During negotiations with the Houston Rockets to build a downtown arena 
earlier this year, the city also sought to cash in on the escalating value of 
naming rights. If voters approved the agreement Nov. 7, the city would 
receive 5 percent of the arena's naming rights, to be capped at $200,000 a 
year. 


	

Enron Considering India Oil, Gas Assets Sale

10/19/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

SINGAPORE -(Dow Jones)- Enron India, a unit of U.S.-based Enron Corp. (ENE)., 
is considering selling its oil and gas assets in the country, a spokesman for 
the company said Thursday. 
Enron India operates three offshore oil and gas fields in a joint venture 
with Oil & Natural Gas Co. (P.ONG) and Reliance Petroleum Ltd. (R.RPT). The 
Tapti, Panna and Mukta fields are located off the coast of Gujerat and 
Maharastra.
It holds a 30% stake in each field, while ONGC and Reliance hold 40% and 30% 
stakes respectively. 
"Enron India is considering the sale of these oil and gas fields," said the 
spokesman. He declined to say how soon the company would arrive at a 
decision. 
He stressed that there would be no disruptions in the operations while the 
company was mulling the sale. 
He added that there would also be no disruptions in the runup to any 
withdrawal should the company opt to sell their stakes in the fields. 
A spokesman for JV partner ONGC said the company would be keen to buy Enron's 
stake if it went up for sale. "Our company will take a look at it. There's no 
reason why ONGC shouldn't be keen," he said. 

Analysts said Enron may be seeking to divest its oil and gas assets to focus 
instead on "new economy" sectors such as telecommunications. "This could be a 
reshuffle as to where they focus their exposure. There's a big push in the 
telecom space," said a Hong Kong-based oil and gas analyst with an 
international merchant bank. 
The analyst said Enron's possible divestment of its oil and gas assets wasn't 
overly negative for India's foreign investment program. 
"Oil companies are always pruning and tweaking their portfolios even in core 
areas. This isn't the beginning of the end of Enron's participation in 
India," he said. 
Sanjeev Prasad, an oil and gas research analyst, with Bombay-based Kotak 
Securities, said Enron India's proposal to shed its oil and gas operation was 
indicative of a broader plan by parent company, Enron Corp., to slim down its 
global operations. 
"Globally, they have been doing it (divesting itself of global assets), and I 
am not too surprised they have done it here," Prasad said. 
If Enron India did proceed with its oil and gas sale, Prasad didn't expect it 
to have any major repercussions in the energy sector as a whole. "It (Enron) 
doesn't have much exposure in oil and gas in India," he said. 
He added that Reliance Petroleum could emerge as a likely buyer of Enron's 
stake. "They're very likely candidates," he said. The Hong Kong-based analyst 
also said Reliance Petroleum could emerge as a prospective buyer if Enron 
sold its oil and gas stake. 
Reliance Petroleum officials were unavailable for comment when contacted by 
Dow Jones Newswires. 
Current production in Enron India's three west coast offshore fields is 
approximately 290 million cubic feet a day of gas and 25,500 barrels a day of 
oil. 
Enron's oil, gas and power holdings in India are estimated to be worth around 
US$3 billion. 
The company's Dabhol power project, due to be completed in the fourth quarter 
of 2001, will generate 2,184 megawatts of power to become the world's largest 
independent natural gas-fired power plant. 
Enron closed the US$1.87 billion financing of the second phase of the Dabhol 
project in May 1999. The financing includes a liquefied natural gas terminal 
and regasification plant, allowing India to import natural gas for the first 
time. 
Enron contracts to purchase 2.1 million tons of LNG from Oman and Abu Dhabi 
to supply Dabhol when the second phase is completed end-2001.

Former Minn. Legislator Eyes Huge Wind Project In Plains
By Jon Kamp
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/19/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- Minnesota farmer Jim Nichols has a healthy soybean and 
corn crop this year. 
But it never hurts to have a little business on the side, or big ideas. So 
Nichols, a former Minnesota legislator, is trying to set up a 3,000-megawatt, 
$7 billion wind power project in South Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota.
"This is a giant step forward," Nichols said. "This one project more than 
doubles all the wind power in the country now." 
Few U.S. companies truly sell wind power competitively. But with natural gas 
prices soaring and environmental laws becoming tougher, the renewable energy 
source is poised to become a real option for developers, Nichols said. You 
just have to build on the right scale. 
Nichols' project, expected to be completed in 2006, is truly enormous. It 
would require 2,000 wind turbines, priced at about $1 million each. The 
turbines would stretch for 500 miles across three states and generate close 
to half the power of the Grand Coulee Dam. 
Nichols is planning to develop the wind farms with Clipper LLC, a recently 
formed Santa Barbara, Calif.-based wind development firm. 
Nichols and Ken Hach, Clipper's new project developer and a former employee 
of Enron Corp.'s (ENE) wind development unit, hope to support the project by 
inking long-term power contracts with Midwestern utilities like Chicago's 
Commonwealth Edison Co. 
The wind project isn't Nichols' first foray into the wind business. In 1994, 
he helped broker a deal that requires Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy Inc. 
(XEL) to buy 425 megawatts of wind power by 2002 in exchange for permission 
to build new storage space for spent nuclear fuel. 
This new project, however, is considerably more complex and faces plenty of 
potential stumbling blocks. First is the massive price tag. 
"The problem with this concept is you're asking big bucks," said Linda Byus, 
a utilities analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Bensen in Chicago. 
Land will have to be acquired to site the turbines. And new transmission 
lines will have to be strung, something few utilities have been able to 
accomplish on any scale in recent years. 
In addition - brace yourselves, environmentalists - the project isn't 
entirely green. 
Since wind turbines can only be expected to turn about a third of the time, 
Nichols and Hach will have to line up a backup source of power to ensure that 
the long-term supply contracts they sign with utilities don't go unfulfilled. 
Although the developers could look to existing plants in the region, the 
back-up they're eying is new coal. According to Nichols, some coal companies 
in Wyoming are ready and willing to build six 500-megawatt plants to support 
the wind power contracts. Northern Plains A Welcome Site 

On the plus side, natural gas prices have soared to record highs, and many 
companies are looking for ways to soften their dependence on the fuel and its 
volatile wholesale markets, said John Dunlop, regional manager for the 
American Wind Energy Association. 
"There's a huge load that people are salivating to satisfy," he said. 
The northern Plains - flat, sparsely populated and home to steady winds - is 
the place to build. The industry, said Bob Gates, senior vice president of 
Enron Wind, calls the region "the Saudi Arabia of wind." 
South Dakota, at least, is actively soliciting developers of wind power. 
South Dakota Public Utilities Commission Chairman Jim Burg, who is hosting a 
meeting on the state's wind-power prospects Wednesday and Thursday, said many 
communities are vying for the chance to host wind-power projects. 
Fees provide some incentive - landowners may be offered 2% of the sale price 
of power generated on their land - as does the prospect of adding hundreds of 
new jobs. 
"I have a hard time not being a major proponent," Burg said. "We haven't had 
that kind of economic impact for a long time." 
Florida's FPL Group, (FPL), the largest wind-power operator in the U.S., is 
already looking at acquiring land in South Dakota, Burg said. 
"We definitely see (South Dakota) as a place to be in the future," said FPL 
spokeswoman Cathy Scott. 
Enron is also interested in the northern Plains. 
"We've done some development work in the area," Gates said. "And we've been 
talking with Clipper and other developers on a variety of projects in the 
area." 
Gates, citing confidentiality agreements, declined to comment on whether the 
company is directly involved in Nichols' projects. But he did say Enron has 
worked with Nichols before and has the capability to develop every aspect of 
a wind generating project. 
Hach, while acknowledging the difficulties of raising financing for wind 
projects, said funds could probably be found. 
"The level of interest on Wall Street is probably not as high as it should 
be," he said. But, "If the economics work, the financing will come." -By Jon

Subject: Thursday Meeting on Winter Gas Prices

Ken:

I have invited the following individuals to join us at the 3 pm Thursday 
meeting to review the draft of your Columbus speech on the natural gas 
situation.

Hamd Alhkayat--Hamd has replaced Andrew Miles in the rotation and will be 
helping me with your presentations as well as being the lead with Jeff's 
speeches.

Shelley Corman--Shelley has been developing messages for the current and 
anticipated gas situation and pipeline safety for the gas pipeline group.  
(The safety issue could come up in your Q&A.)

Stinson Gibner--Stinson is with the research group that has generated some of 
the more complex slides in your draft dealing with volatility and historic 
futures pricing.

Gil Muhl--Gil markets gas products to customers and is speaking at an AGA 
conference on the gas supply and price situation the day before your talk.  
His group is focusing on new products to help end-users with winter 
volatility.  I have asked Gil to send you his presentation as well for the 
meeting.

Back to your presentation (the draft slides of which I am delivering to you 
today), Dan Yergin thought it would be appropriate for you to give an 
overview of the situation as the "teacher" or "professor."  Some questions 
that you could address would include:

Where has the industry come from, and what lessons have we learned?

How is the business different today?

What public policy conclusions are implicit in this history?

I think our comparative advantage over the specialists who will be presenting 
before and after your keynote is that you have "been there" in the evolution 
of the natural gas market, and Enron is at the forefront of helping customers 
deal with price and supply uncertainty.  There is also a good opportunity to 
stress the need for new industry "best practices" (more hedging) and the 
right public policies to deal with this issue (from "do no harm" to expanding 
incentives in the market).

- Rob

Do you mind if the professionals in my group attend?  5 people (assuming they 
all want to go - Margo, Miyung, Linda, Lynnette and Earlene) each at $190 for 
airfare, $380 for two hotel nights, plus shuttle services and misc expenses.  
I'm always encouraging my group to interact with Rick's group, as Gov't 
Affairs is our primary customer base.  

I'm not planning to attend the meeting.

Thanks!

Well, the time has arrived for me to let you know what is in store for 
everyone at the next Government Affairs department meeting on Thursday, June 
14.  The meeting will take place at:

The Omni Interlocken
500 Interlocken Blvd.
Broomfield, Colorado  80021
Phone# 303-438-6600
Fax# 303-464-3252
Check-in time  3:00 p.m.
Check-out time  12:00 p.m. (Noon)

The  Government Affairs meeting will take place on Thursday, June 14 and will 
begin at 8:00 am and will conclude by 11:30 am.  I have arranged for box 
lunches to be served after the meeting.   After the meeting, we will have the 
remainder of the day for some fun activities, along with a buffet dinner 
served that evening to complete the day (on-site dinner location TBD).  

Block of Rooms - A block of rooms have been reserved for Government Affairs.  
I will be turning in a rooming list to the hotel next week so, I  would like 
to know by Friday, April 27 your plans to attend the meeting.   

Shuttle Service -  See attachment for shuttle times.  Please note, a return 
reservation from the hotel to the airport is required.  Please contact the 
Concierge to arrange for shuttle service.

Colorado Weather - For the month of June, you can expect the 
following:         
High's - 80.............Low's - 52

Flights from Houston - I have checked with TAP for roundtrip flights from 
Houston - Denver, Denver - Houston and an exceptionally great 
(non-refundable) fare of $190.94 is available.  However, fares are not 
guaranteed until actually booked.   Let's book early!!!!!

The activities to choose from are as follows:  Please let me know by May 4 
your choice of activity!!!!!!

Whitewater Rafting - A bus will leave the Omni Interlocken Resort at 2:00pm 
to head for an afternoon of exciting adventure on Colorado's Clear Creek.  
The Arkansas River is one of the most popular whitewater adventures anywhere, 
combining spectacular scenery and action packed rapids.  Teamwork is the name 
of the game as your team paddles down these tumbling cascades.  Continuous 
class III and IV rapids will thrill guests throughout the run. Drop over 
Nomad, surge through the Phoenix Holes and take on the class IV climax, the 
Outer Limits.  Good physical condition and the ability to swim are 
recommended.  The group will have three thrilling hours on the river and will 
return to the Omni by 6:15pm.

Chautauqua Park Hiking Adventure - One of the most popular access points for 
mountain hiking trails in Boulder is Chautauqua Park. The focal point is the 
100-year-old dining hall.  The Colorado Chautauqua is one of only four of the 
original Chautauquas still operating in America, as opposed to when thousands 
dotted the nation and culturally enriched rural people in the early 1900s. 
The tour includes: transportation, professional guide service, two hours of 
guided hiking - total time for excursion is 4 hours. (Dress code: Shorts or 
hiking attire, appropriate footwear, sunglasses, sunscreen and hats).  
Departure time and return will be relayed at a later date.

Spa Services -  The Spa at Omni Interlocken Resort offers a number of spa 
services (massages, facial & skin care treatments, body treatments or nail 
services, to name a few).  If you are interested in this as an activity, 
please let me know and I will fax a detailed list of their services.  You 
will need to call the spa and schedule your own appointment if this is the 
activity you choose.

Golf -  For the golf enthusiasts, an afternoon of golf at the Omni 
Interlocken 27-hole championship golf course which stretches out over 300 
acres of verdant fairways is another activity to select from.  Spectacular 
panoramic views from three 9-hole courses, which feature more than 400 feet 
in elevation changes.  If this is the activity of choice please respond via 
e:mail and I will add you to the list.  The game of choice will be "best 
ball" play.

Biking -  Scenic bike paths are located near the hotel for those with 
interest.  If this is your choice of activity, please let me know and I will 
reserve a bike and map for you enjoyment.

After reviewing the choices above, please select an activity you prefer to 
take part in.  Due to the fact that our group is so large, (which makes it 
more difficult to coordinate activities) once you select an activity, we ask 
that you not change your selection.  So, please talk to your colleagues ahead 
of time before making your choice.

Thanks and don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions.

There may be some press today about Enron's involvement in the Nepal hydro 
project.  The government of Nepal is hopeful that we will pursue it, but we 
are not going to.  Kelly's response on press inquiries will be that we are 
not pursuing the project.  Kelly will also be getting in touch with David 
Howe. I just wanted to keep you guys posted in case you are getting 
questions.

Preliminary figures for the Enron Japan website are looking promising. Since 
its launch on Tuesday, we have had 4000 page hits, with an average of 320 
site hits per day and an average stay of 20 minutes.

Advertising to date has been limited to the 300 guests at the office opening 
and the office opening press conference. We will be increasing awareness of 
the site over the coming weeks, mainly through word of mouth, and will 
finalize the articles for next month's edition in a couple of weeks.

All,

Please let me know by noon tomorrow if you have any issues with this 
approach.  If not, we are going to roll out this change effective close of 
business tomorrow.

Steve/Cindy, I'd suggest that we simply make this change tomorrow.  Do you 
feel the need to run it by any of the policy committee beforehand?

Subject: RE: Clickathome - Proposed treatment for Involuntary Terminations -

Suzanne:

It is my understanding that everyone is signed off on the suggested revisions 
to the Clickathome documents relating to redeployed individuals.   Tax is.

In summary, if a person is terminated from Enron or one of its subsidiaries 
as a result of a business reorganization, the forfeiture penalty is waived.  
The amount of the waived forfeiture penalty is added to that individuals 
income as salary (imputed income) and is subject to Federal, State, and FICA 
taxes. 

V&E and I recommend that the changes are effective as of now and not 
retroactive back to the start of the plan.  A retroactive date would weaken 
the plan as it stands and take out some of the teeth that we put in at its 
inception.

 To all, the severance pay plan is not affected.  Please refer to the 
original language :

Reason for this email: Gain consensus on this change 


Business Issue : Find alternatives to the PC forfeiture penalty when an 
employee who has participated in the Clickathome program is involuntarily 
terminated 
   due to business reorganizations.

Proposed Alternative : Replace the cash forfeiture penalty with imputed 
income to be reported on year-end W-2.   The alternative defers or removes 
the cash impact to the    employee.  Employees moving to other Enron units 
who currently do not participate in the program such as PGE and EFS will not 
be required to    report the PC as imputed income as long as they remain in a 
wholly-owned division.

New Process :  Requires payroll administration

Timing:   Effective immediately.  
   Question:  Do you want this retroactive to program inception?


Other Applications: The imputed income option could be expanded to all types 
of terminations. However, in doing so, would allow easier entry into the 
program
   when an employee is planning to leave the company voluntarily.   No 
recommendation at this time to change the forfeiture penalty for these 
other    types of separations.


Please email me with your vote as Kalen is interested in enacting this change 
as soon as possible for the current redeployment candidates.  Thanks.

Steve,

Thank you for participating, once again, in the video for deal central. The 
videos are created, housed and maintained in Beth Tilney's area.
I mentioned to Beth that Corporate may have an interest in sharing/utilizing 
the EES video equipment and expertise. Robert Pearson (our in-house film 
expert) has a masters in video programming, taping, etc. And the good 
news....within the next few weeks, the editing equipment will be fully up and 
running.
Once installed and operational, all in-house produced videos will have the 
look and feel of those created by outside vendors.

Please feel free to contact Beth (ext. 3.5022) if you have an interest in 
exploring this concept.

And thank you again for your participation.

Best-Kim

Steve and Mark:  

I arrived in the US on Saturday with a good feeling about what appears to be 
a successful resolution of the Chorety crisis.  Under Steve Hopper's 
leadership, the Chorety spill became a non-issue by Friday.  During the 
crisis, I collaborated with my counterpart from Shell/London, Michael 
Megarry, in developing a Key Messages and Internal Q&As document (attached).  
At the daily meeting/conference call, there was an Operations Report from the 
site, an analysis of the day's newspaper articles (which I handled), and 
discussions on how to respond to media that were reporting or airing 
inaccurate information that was damaging Transredes' image.   

I also developed a Stakeholders Action Plan (attached) for the Incident 
Commander to use in organizing and monitoring team member actions taken in 
response to stakeholder concerns.  The Plan was updated daily by the 
Transredes PR Office and given to team members prior to every 
meeting/conference call.   The Stakeholder Report is intended to complement 
the Operations Report.  

I also want to acknowledge the support of Karen and Dennis during the early 
stages of the crisis.  It was extremely helpful.

Regards, Keith

FYI.
I think they should try to get in to see Lundquist, but I don't think we need 
to participate in this.  We have been focussed on nation-wide issues when we 
have had the opportunity to meet with Lundquist and I don't think we should 
use our limited shots here.

Subject: Additional Lobbying Efforts

We have met an individual named Wayne Valis, of the Lobbying firm of Valis 
Associates. He likes the approach we are taking to the problem. He is 
offering to get us access to Andrew Lundquist (I said staffer preciously, but 
we now know he is Chairman of the President's Energy Task force). He also 
thinks he can get us in to top levels of the Energy Department, and the White 
House (we think he is talking about Carl Rove - who was G.W.'s Campaign 
Manager and is now a senior White House Counsel).
For this service, he wants $10,000 plus direct expenses. If unsuccessful in 
at least getting us into Lundquist, he will not charge anything. We think 
it's a worthwhile shot. Could Duke and/or Enron agree to split the expense 
with us? Also, it will be imperative that all of us, whether paying or not, 
be represented at whatever meetings are arranged.
Please advise.

I think the letter is well organized to get our message across that a
comprehensive solution is needed.  The only concern I have is the reference
at the end of the first paragraph to  "the crisis grows daily with no clear
resolution offering long term relief in sight."  In fact we do no have
several bills on demand side management, one by Wright on accelerating
repowering of power plants and allowing incentives for voluntary
conservation, at least a vehicle for utility cost recovery (AB-18X), and a
Bown bill to restore direct access rights compromised by AB-1X.  So I am
concerned that the legislative leadership would take some umbrage at the
notion that we dont see any of what they are doing as offering hope for a
long term solution.  Perhaps we could rephrase it to say that the piecemeal
elements of positive solutions that have been discussed or offered need to
be clarified and blended into a comprehensive proposal which has the
following elements....and then lay out our case.

Sandi, do you agree with my concerns?  Otherwise the elements of the letter
are fine, and track what we are trying to draft in terms of legislative
language.  I will break down the proposals into groups of issues for ease of
review, even though we may later want to consoliate the entire package.  

Please call if you have any more questions.  

Thanks, 
Mike Day

Hi Janel:

My name is Michelle Rafter and I'm a writer for the Industry Standard. I work 
with Polly Traylor who
suggested that I contact you for help. I'd like to talk to someone at Enron 
for a story I'm doing
for the Standard on Internet CEOs, including CEOs or presidents who've led 
traditional companies
into successful Internet ventures. I first need to identify who at Enron that 
person would be, i.e.,
who's most responsible for the success of the company's Internet ventures: 
Jeffrey Skilling (he got
the most ink in BusinessWeek's story in this issue), Kenneth Lay, or the head 
of EnronOnline. Then I
need to talk to someone who could help coordinate a phone interview with me 
(I'm in Los Angeles so
this would be a phone interview). Can you give me some suggestions? Ideally, 
I'd love to do an
interview this week, but have some flexibility.

Thanks so much in advance for any help you can give.

sounds good.  I think we should not talk about the conversations with the 
governor . . . I'd rather not prompt them to go to the gov (presumably to 
object to the gov talking to us without talking to them at the same time).

		 Subject: Meeting w/Sempra

FYI.  Recently, Chris Calger has asked me to set up a meeting with Sempra.  
ENA's seeking deals with the two big CA gas IOUs (PG&E and SoCalGas) that 
would give ENA access to their assets.  In short, ENA wants to offer a 
complete outsource deal for the IOUs' core gas load (i.e., rez and small 
commercial customers).  ENA would take responsibility for providing service 
for delivery at the city gate and in return would manage all of core's assets 
(upstream of the city gate).  We're meeting with Sempra's "Chief Regulatory 
Office" (Bill Reed) and Sempra's CFO next Thursday to discuss.

Given the fact that Sempra's primarily focused on electricity, the plan is to 
lead off the meeting with a couple of electricity solutions as a bridge to 
the gas offer.  For electricity, the plan has two pieces:  1) a commodity 
offer that beats the 6.5 cent cap (i.e., nothing fancy) and 2) "Deal Bench" 
services with the intent of establishing a procurement mechanism for SDG&E 
that the California PUC could pre-approve (thereby eliminating some of the 
immense regulatory risk SDG&E now faces).

Wanted to run this by folks to gauge reactions.  We'll distribute the slides 
we're putting together as soon as they're drafted--hopefully by COB Friday.

Best,
Jeff

Hi Steven,

 Attached is the first of four documents that we have prepared for
the focus groups.  All of the exercises are works in progress and I am
sending them to you for comments. (Hopefully, we are on the right track.)
As we discussed, I am happy to fly down to Houston tomorrow so that we can
review these materials together.  If, however, you feel that we can edit the
exercises via email that's fine too. Just let me know which arrangement
makes you the most sense to you. Hope all is well.

together a panel of speakers to address "what is needed to achieve a balanced 
energy policy" at the summer committee meeting.   The panel will consist of 2 
state commissioners, a consumer "type", an environmental advocate, and an 
energy CEO.  She is interested in having someone from Enron on the panel, 
which is scheduled for July 16th in Seattle. 

Are we interested in doing this?  

Lisa

Steve -

With respect to CK Prahalad's visit to Rice. As you know we are having a 
breakfast for the business community the morning of March 19 and he gives 
the Neuhas Lecture on Campus at 9:45 am.  Following the lunch there is a 
lunch with Mrs. Neuhas the donor of the fund and faculty.  That should be 
over by 1:15.  He has a date from two to five at Enron with Yeager (Steve 
or Scott).  He would like to meet with Ken or Jeff sometime that afternoon 
if at all possible.

Thanks for your help.

Enron also announced today a restructuring of its broadband business.  
Conditions in the broadband industry have reduced revenue opportunities in 
the sector.  "The strategy we pursued in the broadband business will allow us 
to quickly restructure this business without affecting our strong earnings 
outlook,"  said Skilling.

Subject: Re: FERC INVESTIGATION IN CA - What should they be looking for?  

Here are some more thoughts:
FERC should take a hard look at why the ISO is almost always in an "inc" 
situation in real time.  Without structural incentives to go short into real 
time, I would expect the CAISO to "inc" in some hours and "dec" in others -- 
with no consistent patterns.
The IOU's have four choices for purchasing power:  PX Block Forward, PX Day 
Ahead, PX Day Of, and CAISO Ex Post.  They had ample opportunity to purchase 
lower cost power in the PX Block Forward but didn't buy enough.  That left 
them short in the Day Ahead.  They can reduce Day Ahead prices by moving some 
of their load to the Ex Post market.  Dave Parquet did an Econ 101 
presentation on this incentive at the CAISO board meeting in June.
The ISO remains primarily in "inc" mode even during the shoulder months when 
prices are lower, another indicator that the real time "inc" problem is 
driven by the load side rather than the supply side.  The IOU's continue to 
go short into the ISO Ex Post market even when the CAISO Ex Post price is 
consistently above the PX Day Ahead price.
There is evidence that the IOU's are not willing to pay above the CAISO price 
cap for energy from the PX in the Day Ahead market.  Does it matter that the 
price cap for the ISO also acts as a PX price cap?
The NOx market in California is very tight.  How has this contributed to 
higher costs and has the complete lack of available NOx credits prevented any 
generators from running?
How large was the impact of the below normal water year on the supply side?  
The attached presentation quantifies this effect in the Northwest.  (I have a 
theory on how hydro capacity completely overstates reserve margins in the 
west from an economic perspective.  I can go into more detail if you wish.)
Friction between California PX and ISO markets and other western markets.  
For example, why are actual flows going into the state yet prices out side of 
the state are higher?  Another example of anomylous behavior is at COB on 
8/11 and 8/12.  There was congestion from California TO the northwest those 
days in the Day Ahead market.  In real time the NW ended up being a net 
seller of about 3,000 MW from the NW TO California.
Demand Side - we really need to press on this issue because all of the 
proponents of price caps claim that as soon as the demand side is "workably 
competitive" then there is no need for price caps.  Is large-scale economic 
demand response required for a competitive market?  What if demand response 
is there, but at very high prices?  The demand response in California is a 
joke.  With 2700 MW of interuptible, why did the utilities and the CAISO only 
get around 600 MW of economic demand response.  Much of this response comes 
at $1500/MWh.  The assymetric treatment of supply side resources and demand 
side resources can be justified on environmental grounds, but not economic 
grounds.  So why this assymetric treatment?  This gets to the question of the 
fine line between "scarcity rents" which are ok, and market power which is 
not.  If power is scarce, and demand truly values it at $1500/MWh then 
shouldn't that be the price.  At what price would the rest of the 
interuptible load economically curtail?  Bottom line -- there are about 2,000 
MW of load that should be able to respond to price signals that chooses not 
to or values power at more than $1500/MWh.
Burden of proof -- what empirical measures should be used to assess market 
power?  The reports published to date have been unimpressive.  The Market 
Analysis Unit report, for example, does a bunch of handwaving and then 
concludes that there is market power.  But they never explain why.  I would 
think that proof might be something like this:  Generator X sets price y% of 
the time when loads exceed Z MWs.  Or, four generators set price 80% of the 
time when prices exceed $200/MWh.  They have all the data to be able to tell, 
yet they don't provide any empirical measures.  The only test I've heard of 
so far is the UC Energy Institute report that demonstrates that generators 
are submitting bids above their marginal cost.  The PX report states that 
supply bids are fewer and at higher prices than last year.  They fail to 
mention the fact that there are 5,000 fewer MW of hydro this year relative to 
last.

Subject: FERC INVESTIGATION IN CA - What should they be looking for?

As we begin to meet with FERC Staff on the Wholesale market issues related to 
CA problems, I think that we need to put together a list of questions that 
FERC needs to be asking Western power market participants.  

The following are some questions that I think are important to have FERC ask; 
I'm sure there are more.

1. Were California utilities underscheduling load into the PX day ahead 
market?  
2. How many MWs did the CA ISO procure during each hour during the Summer 
2000?  How does this compare with CA ISO procurement during 1999?
3. Has PG&E changed its bidding behavior associated with its Hydro facilities 
in 2000?  
3. Are there baseload facilities that were operated differently in 2000 than 
in 1999?
4. Were any generation plants off-line due to unplanned maintenance during 
Summer 2000?
5. How did the CA ISO demand side program work?  Why didn't more load 
participate?  
6. What options did SDG&E have to "hedge" its retail rates?  What were prices 
in the CAL PX block forward market on Jan 15, 2000 and May 15, 2000?
7. How high did natural gas prices go in California for generation during 
Summer 2000?
8. Were other Western power markets prices higher (year-on-year)?
9. Did the CA ISO Board face political pressure to reduce bid caps?  Is this 
appropriate for a FERC jurisdictional entity?
10. What specific details is SDG&E referring to in its Complaint on 
"unworkably competitive" CA ISO markets?  Can these be fixed "quickly"?

Please add other questions.

Jim

As you can see, I disagree with Mark per the attached e-mail I sent him 
earlier today.  I do not think it should be Jeff Skilling.  Mark does not 
appear to concur with me.  Perhaps I should go ahead and express our interest 
to testify and then we can have a conversation with the team to decide who 
should do it.  I was just trying to not waste a chit and ask for a spot if we 
had no interest.  We can determine who and what later.  So, before I ask the 
Committee, we DO want to testify, correct?

Mark:  I disagree.  The field hearings are not as high profile as a D.C. 
hearing.  Further, we can wait to see who PG&E sends and others.  Likely the 
California utilities will send their CEO's so if we need to be on the same 
panel with them we would need to send Jeff Skilling.  But, tactically, we may 
not wish to do this?  Otherwise, we can go for a technical person or for 
someone like Steve Kean......this will be for local press and politicals more 
so than federal (I doubt that more than 4-6 Congressional members even 
show.)  Again, we have not been asked to testify.  I was just trying to

THE FINAL WORD 
CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF AN ENORmous stupidity crisis. Californians have 
been sitting in the dark because ... they didn't turn the lights on.
They say they're short of electricity. Yes, they are. Between 1988 and 1998, 
California's electricity consumption increased by 15 percent. Meanwhile 
California's capacity to generate electricity shrank by five percent, even as 
the state hesitated to build new power lines to tap into neighboring states' 
power supplies. 
Californians didn't want dams across their rivers, derricks on their ocean, 
power lines across their borders, or fossil fuel smoke in their sky. These 
might interfere with all the smart things Californians do, such as 
hang-glide. California was going to rely on "negawatts" - dramatic power 
conservation. (But California regulators put price controls on electricity 
that lowered prices, and even Californians weren't dumb enough to skip a 
bargain.) And California was going to rely on alternative power generation. 
With all the puffery from Silicon Valley dot.com start-ups, wind farms 
wouldn't be a problem. And doesn't Gwyneth Paltrow's star shine bright enough 
to operate a solar panel? But it turns out that alternative power generation 
is an alternative, mostly, to generating power. 
Californians are people who insist on growing their own vegetables, but they 
won't dig up the pretty lawn, won't plant anything for fear of getting dirty, 
and they use fragrant bath salts from The Body Shop instead of smelly 
compost. Let them make their crudites with crab grass. President Bush was 
wrong to grant an extension of executive orders requiring out-of-state 
utilities to supply power to California. And everyone is wrong to listen to 
Californians whine about electricity deregulation. 
There never was any deregulation. The California Public Utilities Commission 
merely changed its regulations, which apparently weren't stupid enough to 
meet Golden State standards. Under California's 1996 re-regulation plan, 
electric companies sold their generating plants and became distributors. They 
were required to buy their power on the wholesale spot market and forbidden 
to enter into any long-term power supply contracts. Retail electricity prices 
were lowered by 10 percent and frozen at the new rate until March 2002. 
This is like requiring A&P to sell you porterhouse at $2 a pound, no matter 
what the price of beef on the hoof. Imagine how many steaks there would be, 
and how many supermarkets. Go to one of those boarded-up grocery stores, 
purchase a phantom T-bone, screw it into a ceiling fixture, and try to light 
your house. You're in California. 
Californians devised a system of electricity sales that ignored every 
dimension of the free market. (Interesting that the "Information Economy" is 
centered in a place that's immune to information.) The free market is a 
yardstick, and Californians got smacked with it. Mideast oil jitters, cold 
weather, natural gas price spikes, and the plain unpredictable freedom of the 
free market caused wholesale electricity costs to rise and California 
utilities to go $12 billion into the red. 
California's governor Gray Davis responded with the full force of bikini 
beach brain. In a January 8 speech to the state legislature, Davis proposed 
creating a state agency to buy generating plants and build new ones. He 
threatened to expropriate power generators and transmission grids. He called 
for laws to allow criminal prosecution of wholesale suppliers who withheld 
electricity from California markets. And he said the state's universities and 
community colleges would build co-generating plants and become energy 
independent. (With gas produced by the cafeteria food?) Gray Davis sounded 
like Joseph Stalin with the IQ of Keanu Reeves. "Everyone should understand 
that there are other, more drastic measures that I am prepared to take if I 
have to," Davis declaimed. 
"Take" is the key word. Grabby Californians tried to regulate themselves into 
some cheap electricity. Hoggish California power companies went along because 
the stateimposed retail price ceiling was also a retail price floor. 
According to the Los Angeles Times, during the first 28 months of the scheme, 
Pacific Gas and Electric and California Edison made $20 billion from the 
legally required mark-up between wholesale and retail electric prices. 
Californians want to snatch that money back. "Consumer advocates around 
California... said it did not matter that the utilities were returning 
investments to their shareholders," reported the January 31 Washington Post. 
"They took the money and ran," said state senator John Burton. As opposed to 
Californians, who took the electricity and roller-bladed? Now the juice and 
the jack are both gone, and the California legislature has had to pass a bill 
authorizing $10 billion to try to clean up the mess. 
But the Californians could still pull a scam. The bill mandates long-term 
power contracts at rates that are way above what future prices should be. The 
hope, one guesses, is that Congress, or the President, or somebody will let 
the state skip out on those contracts once the costs are lower. 
It would be wrong to call Californians stupid. They're sleazy, too.

Subject: Senate passes Alper/Davis Bill 30-0

AB 265 passed through the Senate a few minutes ago.  It now must go to the 
Assembly, where there is still a lot of uncertainty about what changes the 
Assembly will want to the bill.  We still haven't seen the latest 
"republican" language.

Also, AB 265 is double joined to AB 970, controversial siting bill.  To the 
extent one or the other fails, they both fail.

AB 265 (Davis/Alpert) has:

1.  a 6.5 cent/kWh energy rate cap through 2002, with potential extension 
through 2003.
2.  Applicable to residential, small commercial (up to 100 kW)
3.  Opt-in provision for large industrial/agricultural customers at 6.5 cents 
with an annual true-up
4.  Use of revenues from utility generation assets (including PPA) to offset 
undercollections.
5.  Reasonableness review for San Diego G&E

Will update with more information as available.

No news about SCE.

Power Hogs May Get Hit In Pocketbook 
Davis favors tiered rate increases

N30195.DTL 
Gov. Gray Davis, faced with the near inevitability of raising consumers' 
electricity bills, is leaning toward a rate system whereby those who use more 
power pay more than those who conserve, The Chronicle has learned. 
Sources close to the governor said he is being lobbied by his own staff 
members to accept a so-called structured rate system. 
Top officials from his own administration told lawmakers Friday that the 
state may end up spending more than twice the $10 billion previously 
estimated to purchase power on behalf of California's near-bankrupt 
utilities. 
If so, the officials warned that consumers' electricity rates could double. 
In the case of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., this would mean customers' 
average monthly power bills would rise from $60 to $120. 
Consumers throughout the Bay Area believe that at least some increase is on 
the way. 
"We're going to have to bite the bullet and pay the money," said Larry 
Webster, a retired Caltrans worker in Redwood City. "We might as well admit 
that electricity is no longer a nickel. It's a dime. If you're going to use 
it, 
let's pay for it." 
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, distanced himself yesterday 
from estimates that rates would double. The figures reported in the press, he 
said, "were wildly high." 
"The governor still believes he can live within the existing rate structure, 
" Maviglio said. "Until we know the results of the negotiations with the 
utilities, you can't conclude anything." 
The state is negotiating a multibillion-dollar bailout package with PG&E and 
Southern California Edison Co. to relieve the utilities of about $13 billion 
in debt. 
PG&E and Edison have been saying for months that there is no way California 
can overcome its current energy woes without higher rates. The irony of the 
Davis administration now saying the same thing was not lost on the two 
companies. 
"The state is in the exact same position the utilities were in last fall," 
said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. "Either wholesale prices need to come 
down or retail prices need to go up. The disparity is too large." 
Statewide blackouts last week drove home the precariousness of California's 
energy situation to ratepayers -- and may have served as a blessing in 
disguise for the governor. 
COST VS. OUTAGES
If given a choice between further outages and paying higher rates, many 
consumers said they would accept increases in their power bills. 
"I don't like either choice," said Janet Leroux, facing the possibility of a 
gooey mess if the air conditioning goes out at her downtown San Francisco 
candy store. "But I guess I'd go with higher rates. I sure didn't like the 
blackouts." 
Publicly, the governor has been insisting for weeks that rates will stay 
within "the existing rate structure" -- a stealthy way of saying that 
January's 9 percent increase and an expected 10 percent increase next year 
will remain in place. 
But privately, he and his staff are discussing additional rate increases that 
could be spread over as long as 10 years, sources said. 
Utility executives and power generators told The Chronicle last week that a 
minimum 30 percent rate increase lasting up to a decade is in the cards. 
"For the good of California, it's inevitable," said Gary Ackerman, executive 
director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a Menlo Park energy industry 
association. 
Sacramento resident John Hax observed that when temperatures soar in the 
Central Valley this summer, he'd be more than willing to pay a higher price 
for power if this keeps the air conditioners on. 
"It's like gasoline," he said. "I don't like paying higher prices for 
gasoline, but that's the price of doing business." 
Ratepayers draw the line, though, at any increase topping 10 or 20 percent. 
"If it was 20 percent, I'd probably do it," said Tracy resident Mark 
Dougherty. "But if it was more, like 50 percent, I'd rather go with rolling 
blackouts." 
"I'd rather have blackouts," agreed Jenny Soghomonian, owner of a shoe- 
repair shop in San Francisco's Financial District. "I don't want to pay rates 
that are so much higher." 
NOT EVERY COST PALATABLE
This is the tightrope that state officials and industry players now find 
themselves walking: While consumers may be willing to pay more to avoid 
blackouts, they aren't willing to swallow virtually any cost thrown their 
way. 
Yet if rates are not high enough, they may not prevent daily blackout threats 
this summer and beyond. 
"Higher rates are the price signal that it takes for conservation," said Tom 
Higgins, senior vice president of Edison International, parent company of 
Southern California Edison. 
Simply put, he meant that most consumers will not aggressively conserve 
power, and thus alleviate shortages, unless there is a financial incentive to 
do so. 
Rebates proposed by the governor have met with only a lukewarm response, 
requiring, critics say, too much effort on the part of individual ratepayers. 
But a sudden spike in monthly power bills almost certainly would prompt 
widespread conservation measures. 
"It adjusts consumer behavior," Higgins said. "People want to get their bills 
back down." 
RATES' EFFECT ON USAGE
He and other industry sources said higher rates are perhaps the only way 
Californians will achieve the 10 percent conservation goal sought by the 
governor -- a move seen as vital if blackouts are to be avoided this summer. 
"It's intellectually dishonest to think there's any other way out of this," 
Higgins said. 
Consumer activists' initial reaction to any talk of a rate increase comes 
across loud and clear: No, no, no. 
"No bailout. No rate increases. No secret deals," said Harvey Rosenfield, 
head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. "We 
need to get back to a regulated system." 
Rosenfield is the biggest fly in the governor's ointment. He has threatened 
to push through a ballot initiative re-regulating California's power market 
if Davis cannot find a consumer-friendly way out of the current fix. 
Because of Rosenfield's past success in writing a ballot measure on insurance 
rebates, which delivered about $800 million to consumers, his threat is taken 
seriously in Sacramento. 
"We've paid too much already," Rosenfield said. "A fair price is what we were 
promised by deregulation, which was a 20 percent rate decrease." 
However, when he was asked whether there was any room to discuss a structured 
rate increase such as the idea being promoted by the governor's staff, 
Rosenfield toned down his characteristic rhetoric. 
"Big users should pay more," he said after a moment's reflection. "I'm open 
to a tiered system but only if it's fair." 
Rosenfield quickly added that he would have to see how other consumer 
advocates felt about the matter before agreeing to negotiate such things with 
Davis. 
MOVE TOWARD STRUCTURED RATES
Clearly, though, momentum is building toward a system of structured power 
rates, which probably would include increases of varying sizes for consumers. 
The California Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to address January's 
9 percent rate increase on Tuesday. That increase originally was given only a 
three-month duration, but most observers expect it to be renewed for at least 
another three months, if not longer. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch declined to comment on the likelihood of rates 
going up but added her voice to those backing a structured system. 
"I am a fan of restructuring rates to exempt conservation," she said. "People 
who use a whole lot of power should pay more." 
The biggest electricity customer in the state is the state itself, now that 
California is purchasing power on behalf of its cash-poor utilities. The 
state already has spent about $4 billion buying electricity and has yet to 
determine how the cash will be recouped from consumers. 
San Francisco resident Rosita Magee accepts that for California to find its 
energy footing once more, rates will probably be heading up. "That way, you 
have more convenience and electricity, more stability," she said. 
But Magee has come up with another solution, one that doesn't involve rate 
increases and rolling blackouts. 
She's moving to Texas.

Subject: New Economy Conference with Senate Democrats


Mr. Skilling,

The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) and Senators Daschle,
Murray, Wyden, Leahy, Bingaman, Kerry, Baucus, Carnahan, Durbin, Dorgan and
Schumer are hosting a series of discussions on the future of the New Economy
in Beaver Creek, Colorado on March 2-4, 2001.  At this time, we have about
40 executives from venture capital, communications and other high tech
businesses attending the conference.  Most of those attendees joined the
DSCC's High Technology Council in 2000.

The Council was created last year in order to create a bridge between
Democratic Senators and key leaders of the New Economy.  Throughout 2000, we
hosted dinners, meetings and conferences that gave high tech leaders and
Senators the opportunity to engage in an ongoing dialogue on the key issues
facing the nation.  As a result, the Senators and participants in the
Council were able to develop a solid understanding of the challenges facing
both government and business.  We hope that this effort has created a
foundation for strong, long-term relationships between the two groups.

The Conference in March is a continuation of last year's efforts, but we
will focus on a few of the key issues facing the New Economy to allow both
sides can drill down and gain a better understanding of some of the
opportunities and problems we will face in the near future.

In order to attend, you would need to become a member of the DSCC's High
Tech Council by donating $25,000 to the DSCC.  That would make you eligible
to participate in a series of events, conferences and meetings this year
with other industry leaders and Democratic Senators.

I have attached an invitation to the event, a registration form and
information on becoming a member of the Council.  We have reserved only a
small number of rooms for new members of the DSCC's High Tech Council.  If
you would like to attend, please let me know as soon as possible and please
do not hesitate to contact me regarding any questions, concerns or for more
information.  I can have a firm agenda to you in the very near future but I
am waiting on some feedback from people like yourself regarding the issues
they would like to discuss.  In your response, please let me know if you
have any particular issues that are of concern to you.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Chad FitzGerald
Director - DSCC High Technology Council

		 Subject: Memo Re State Processes for Takeover of Transmission

Here is an initial draft from our attorneys in California on the state 
processes that could be required.  In my experience, the single biggest issue 
the utilities have is the transfer of the rights of way -- there are 
thousands of these -- each like an individual contract.  If the state tried 
eminent domain, it seems like it could face a long-time in the courts to 
finish that process.

key members I recall are: andy fastow, gene humphrey,cliff baxter, ken rice, 
rick causey, lou pai, kevin hannon.  it's easier for me to remember those who 
are still around and in leadership positions as these folks are.  it's also 
interesting to note that with the exception of rick, gene and andy, all of 
these guys were in other parts of enron but were attracted to jeff's team by 
his vision for a new approach to the energy business.

Hi Steve,

Cindy Olson referred me to you, suggesting that you would have the 
information mentioned below.  Enron University Affairs, Ken Lay, Jeff 
Skilling, Andy Fastow and Gene Humphrey have been working with Harvard 
Business School, specifically Chris Bartlett and Meg Wozny of Harvard, on a 
case study of Enron.  This study is in its last phase and the only 
'roadblock' is gathering additional information.  In particular, Harvard 
would like 'a listing of key members of ENA, particularly Skilling's early 
hires.'  

This information will help facilitate drawing an effective comparison of the 
'old' Enron and the 'new' Enron.  

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Regards,

Cindy Derecskey

I mentioned the need to call Gramm in the exec committee meeting today and 
Ken is willing to do it.  The talking points ISDA sent looked fairly 
generic.  Given Ken's relationship, and the fact that he has talked to Gramm 
previously on the subject, what should we ask Ken to cover?  I'd like to give 
him a background document and talking points like we did last time.  I will 
send it by fax to you Chris and would appreciate it if you could update it as 
appropriate.

Hi Steve.  I know you are extremely busy  but I was just  wondering if you 
found out about whether the 3 year period apllies to all  options or just the 
ones in that program.  Question 2)  does the 3 year time frame apply to only 
options that are vested at the time of departure or does it apply also to 
options which vest over the 3 year time frame.  I look forward to hearing 
from you.  Thank you.

Steve, I noticed that our allocation from 2000 to 2001 is going up by 21% 
year on year (ie) $13.9M from $11.5M.  We have been able to keep ENA's direct 
group expenses flat year on year, we are trying hard to keep the corporate 
allocation flat year to year as well.  Do you have a view on how we might be 
able to achieve this goal?

Subject: EES

Steve, I'm not sure if you remember me, but I was the gentleman that talked 
to you at the Floor Meeting on April 18th for ETS personnel.

If you remember, I mentioned that some of our engineering people had 
transferred to EES last year and that now they all want back due to the mass 
confusion in that organization such as billings being done on Excel 
spreadsheets, no one being allowed to talk to other groups, etc. etc. 

Today, one of these employees, Linda Uselman, paid me a visit to inform me of 
her resignation from EES.  I mentioned to Linda about my discussion with you 
and she said she would very much like to share with you what is going on in 
EES.

Linda was one of our best employees.  While we hated to see her go to EES, we 
thought this was for the good of Enron.  Now we see that everyone lost on 
this deal.

Thanks, Norm

3.  I have asked Paul Portney to review "the lay of the land" in the 
environmental policy area.
4.  Since we couldn't locate a speaker to address the question of how Enron, 
now larger and more corporate than in the past, can continue to attract the 
best, the brightest (and the oddest?), I have asked Pankaj to give a brief 
talk about what the literature generated by his colleagues has to tell us on 
this subject.
5.  I couldn't get anyone on the "monopoly-too-big-and-powerful" question, 
although I am still trying.
I assume you folks will brief us on California and the national energy supply 
picture. Have we heard from the author of "When Genius Fails"?

To:	Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES

Subject:	Monthly Billing - Detail Class 845 / s100061.xls

Year 2000 changes:
Phone charges:  Phones are being charged to the person's company and cost 
center where possible, otherwise rent as before.  The description will start 
with People\ or Room\ unless it was entered manually at the source.
Data connections:  One connection is being charged for each room instead of 
one connection for each port in a room.

Attached  are spreadsheets with the detail supporting the expenses for 
telephones, data ports, EDI, Enterprise LAN, Enterprise Help Desk, video 
conferencing, Internet access, email, and other services provided to Enron 
business units by Enron Information Services. 

EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, 
and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&T 
calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in 
EB or 3AC.  For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by Tammy Anderson 
for this purpose.  

People specific services for employees are billed to the company and cost 
center corresponding to the employee's HR company and department. Video 
conference usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings 
are based on a company and cost center furnished by the person requesting the 
service.

EIS bills services on a one month lag.  We take a snapshot of the Corporate 
Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha 
phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the HR company and department 
for each employee.  This snapshot is taken at the end of each month for use 
as a source for billing information.  

Please examine these billings for accuracy.  If our billings are incorrect, 
generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting 
Corporate Administrative Services or the person should be moved to the 
correct HR department by contacting your HR representative.  If the room 
number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, this may be 
corrected by sending the room number along with the telephone number to Notes 
Mail ID "Move-Team".

Per our conversation on coordination of our efforts on California and other 
jurisdictions, we have developed the following training program:

1.    Anti-trust -- we have completed anti-trust training in Houston for 
traders and have scheduled it in Portland and Calgary.

2.    Sales Practices -- this training has been completed in Portland and is 
being scheduled in Houston and Calgary.

3.    Anti-manipulation -- this training has been completed in Portland, but 
needs to be expanded to cover local law manipulation issues.  It also needs 
to be scheduled in Houston and Calgary. 

Also, the above training needs to be supplemented with training on local 
power pool rules.  There is a similar program being prepared in London.  A 
meeting is being scheduled so we can discuss these matters further.

Presidents, etc. that he would like to bring industry informaiton to as
well as a bit more about us.

I will call after you've had the opportunity to review this to arrange a

Thanks for your voice mail the other day.  Your memo certainly helped in 
better understanding the situation.  Locally, we have not seen any additional 
articles on CA or on dereg, but will let you know if we do. I will also take 
onboard your other comments.  I speak with Mark tomorrow to go over Nick's

Would it be possible to use LiveLink to capture the information we gathered 
for the organization/budget review (such as functions of the different groups 
and the roles and responsibilities of the different individuals, budgets 
etc)?  I hate to see all that ggod information sit idle.

My only comment relates to the Azurix reference  ... it's not a significant 
part of the biz and things have changed recently.  i don't think it merits 
reference.

Hi Rick,

Thank you again for spending time with Alan and me this week on the Enron case
study for my book.  Attached for your review is a draft that we put 
together.  I
think you will be happy with the tone and content of the case.  Otherwise,
please call me to discuss any changes you might have.

(See attached file: 17_Enron-am-jl.doc)

Note that the case makes reference to three charts that you said you would 
email
to me:

   Organizational chart of the RAC Group and summary descriptions (we will use

Can we also get something in the stip that limits the market making activity 
or at least promises a reexamination of the scope of the market making 
activity after some period of time.  Also, can we strengthen the language to 
give us something beyond simply a right to file  -- which is a right we have 
anyway.

Attached is the proposed Stip to allow PJM to move forward as an RTO.

In the Stip, we argue that PJM should be approved by FERC but condition our 
acceptance on a FERC process to unify the Northeast markets.

My only comment is to delete the final WHEREAS paragraph on congestion 
management.  

While our ability to later stop PJM from being an RTO is limited, I believe 
that this gives us the ability to drive a consolidation of the Northeast 
markets - which is one of the goals of the East Power desk.

In addition, I think that the overall direction of PJM in commercializing its 
software is a good activity for our interest - even if we don't want 
everything in their package.

Sarah is out until Monday when we need to get back with PJM.

Jim

Per our discussion this morning, below is a summary of items to discuss with 
Glynn:

Adding Enron's "negative CTC claim" to the list of claims: PGE's filing 
included a list of top twenty creditors.  Our negative CTC claim was 
apparently not taken into account in compiling that list.  The list is 
nonbinding, however.  PG&E will be required to file schedules of creditors on 
April 20.  Our negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F (for unsecured 
claims).  You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and 
state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear (preferably as 
uncontested) in the April 20 filing. (Note: if PG&E does not include the 
claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the 
court determines the validity of the claim).
Including Enron on the Creditors' Committee:  PG&E may have the opportunity 
to influence representation on the creditors' committees.  There are several 
reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included: 1) we are a big creditor, 2) 
we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution, and 3) we are one of the 
real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO (who were listed as 
significant creditors but are really just "passthroughs" for the suppliers 
... and PG&E likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on 
the creditors committee anyway).

Hi Mark and Steve -

Chad said he has sent this to quite a few people, so it might be overkill, 
but thought I'd send to you.  He has sent to Jeff, Mike McConnell (who told 
him he's forwarding to Dan Reck, who is in charge of the new freight

Ken,

My name is Chad Tipton.  I am currently a Development Support Manager with 
EES in the Integrated Asset Management (IAM).   Recently, I  had the good 
fortune to meet, Ron Hosmer.  He represents a company called IdleAire 
Technologies, Inc..  IdleAire is a startup company started in 1999.   
IdleAire has developed a system to eliminate truckdrivers from having to idle 
their trucks while on long haul overnight stops.  Their plan is to electrify 
truckstops and install remote HVAC units to eliminate truck idling.  Also, 
these units provide cable TV and internet services.  They have already 
piloted the technology in several truckstops in the Knoxville, TN area.

IdleAire's  goal is to: 

"........evolve the nation's truck stops and travel centers into the largest 
truck stop electrification network in the world. We are taking truck stop 
electrification to the next level. Our travel center conversions provide 
heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) at every parking space. We 
also provide drivers in-cab telephone, Internet and television."

Idle Air has caught the attention of many interest groups in Washington, 
D.C.  Ron tells me that they have already gained support from Tennessee 
congressmen, including Jimmy Duncan and  Van Hilleary.   Also, former House 
Speaker, Newt Gingrich is on the board of directors of IdleAire 
Technologies.  These individuals support this technology because it reduces 
emissions and helps state quality for CMAQ funds.  

I had mentioned to Ron, that I worked for Enron and informed him about what 
we do.  He and I both felt that Enron may be interested in developing a 
strategic partnership to take their technology to market.   Ron said that 
they are looking for a strategic partner with energy related experience and 
the capital to invest in this project.  

Enron would benefit in several ways:

1.  Greater than average returns.

2.  Increased publicity and recognition in Enron's environmental role.  (EPA 
Energy Star Label, EPA Climate Protection Award, etc....)
 
3.  Increase markets for electricity and possibly gas.

4.  Maintain Enron's title of innovation leader.

5.  Open a whole new market for the energy services group. (EES)  Long term 
maintenance contract, commodities, etc....

6.  Open a new market for the broadband services group. (EBS)  Videos on 
demand.

I believe this opportunity is very synergistic with Enron's business model.  
If you would be interested in talking with Ron, I would be happy to introduce 
him to you.  They have a  very comprehensive business plan that lays out 
their business in detail.   I have arranged for him to provide us with an 
executive summary of the business.  You can also find out more about the 
company by visiting their website at:

www.idleaire.com

Thank you  for your time.

I think the presentation looks fine, but consider adding this:  there is real 
risk to utilities (as well as customers) in continuing a regulated regime.

Steve,


I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  If 
you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.









As far as recommendations, here is a short list:

 1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales 
above monthly index without enough consideration of future 
      replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be 
injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.
                    This creates a shortage in later months.

 2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet 
demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.  
                      Specific questions should include:  

  1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order 
to fill storage?

  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too 
much gas from Socal's system.  
       I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their 
own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than 
their injection capablity, but injected far less.

 3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short 
term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major 
                    LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating 
rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market 
and the 
     consumer has benefitted.  


Call me if you need any more input.


Phillip

I think he was looking to make a sector-wide point.  For example, how much of 
the total market moved to wholesale traded volumes?  He wants to make the 
point that even a nontraded commodity - ie electricity in 1994 - can rapidly 
progress to a traded market - as electricity did between 94 and 00.

Dear Steve and Rick,

Thank you very much for inviting me to Houston yesterday to discuss Enron's
Federal Government Affairs position.  Your vision of the role for the Enron
Washington office fits closely with my views on what a best-in-class
Washington operation should offer, and it was helpful to learn more about
Enron and its business units.  Enron is clearly an exciting place to work,
and the fact that public policy is so vital to the company's future makes
the Washington position particularly attractive.

It was a real pleasure to meet you yesterday, and I look forward to hearing
from you again.

Sincerely,


Tim Richards

		 Subject: Senate Action on DOD Conference Report

Tonight by a vote of 91/2 (although Senator Wellstone was asking to switch 
his vote; so the final vote may end up being 90/3) the Senate passed the 
Conference Report on the DOD Reauthorization, H.R. 4205.  With the 
overwhelming majority votes in both the House and Senate this week, the bill 
will now be enrolled and sent to the President for signature.

Although the statutory language and report language is a clear victory for 
EFS; we did not in the end have the draft colloquy entered into the record 
regarding the enforcement interpretation.  Seems EEI's lawyers had submitted 
a colloquy of their own.  Thus, our colloquy successfully served the purpose 
of blocking theirs which we should list as a "victory" given that their 
colloquy would have been damaging to us.  So in the end, Enron achieved all 
its legislative goals while EEI was unsuccessful in even gaining a statement 
for the record.

Off the record, we did gain acceptance for the issue raised in our colloquy 
by DOD and they stand ready to defend their enforcement authority; possibly 
at the upcoming NARUC meeting.

Bill signature; and thus, Public Law enactment, could occur as early as next 
week.  We will keep you advised as to when this occurs.  Again, 
congratulations to the team for a successful legislative effort against some 
stiff odds.

Since Enron and EBS are trying to cut costs and be more cost effective, why 
would a vice president need an executive computer setup at home?  Especially 
if they already have a laptop (provided by Enron)  they take home every night 
and have taken advantage of the Click at Home program as well.  Since Enron 
has gone through the expense of giving each and every employee the 
opportunity of the Click at Home program, it seems to be a somewhat redundant 
expense of which I might add is unnecessary in my opinion.

I feel it would behoove ALL EMPLOYEES, including executives, to be more 
conscientious of costs and expenses to improve Enron's and EBS' bottom-line.  
How can we ("Enron") be a world leading company if we don't have leading 
world leaders that spend Enron's money as if it were there own.

I think it would be in Enron's best interest to set some guidelines regarding 
expenses such as these.  Just because a person is an executive of the company 
why should be allowed to have anything they want just because they can?

Thank you for your time and the opportunity to express myself.  Especially 
since I am a shareholder also and care where the money goes.

Energy buyout foes say dump grid plan
Davis critics point to federal veto disclosure=20
By Steve Geissinger
SACRAMENTO BUREAU=20
SACRAMENTO -- Foes of Gov. Gray Davis' plan to buy power lines said Tuesday=
=20
the 11th-hour disclosure of federal veto power over the stalled deal shows=
=20
the effort should be abandoned altogether.=20
But Davis, who spent the day lobbying federal officials in Washington, D.C.=
,=20
said he's confident the Bush administration will support his plan to purcha=

California's high-voltage transmission grid as part of a deal to rescue=20
teetering utilities.=20
Critics of the plan to ease the energy crisis, however, aren't so sure that=
=20
Bush's Republican administration, which favors market-driven strategies ove=
r=20
government intervention, will support the Democratic governor's proposal.=
=20
Moreover, Republican legislators here said, the last-minute revelation that=
=20
the plan would need the approval of federal regulators is further evidence=
=20
that it is misdirected, overly complex and will take too long to implement.=
=20
"It means much more time will be required and time is something that=20
especially a lot of the creditors of the utilities do not have," said=20
Assembly Republican leader Bill Campbell of Villa Park.=20
"I think this means we have to look at an alternative deal," Campbell said.=
=20
Dan Nelson, a spokesman for Senate Republican leader James Brulte of Rancho=

They instead support acquisition of some other asset from the utilities, su=

Word that Davis' plan to buy transmission lines would need federal approval=

surprised some legislators, their aides said. Open government advocates hav=
e=20
harshly criticized the administration for secrecy surrounding much of the=
=20
governor's energy crisis relief efforts.=20
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Curtis Hebert disclosed=20
recently in Washington that his board has authority over the deal, which he=
=20
called "nationalization" that is "against the best interests of the America=
n=20
public."=20
Following that disclosure, Democratic legislative leaders backing Davis' pl=
an=20
said they hope to maneuver around the need for commission approval.=20
California can perhaps circumvent the potential hitch by relying in part on=
 a=20
1946 case involving the state of Nebraska that did not require federal=20
approval, according to Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisc=

Nevertheless, Davis, in Washington for a national governors meeting, said h=

presented a nine-page proposal to U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and=
=20
expects a response by the end of the week.=20
"He wants this problem solved and he's been very supportive," Davis said.=
=20
"He's recommended approval on every request I've made and I believe he will=
=20
support our proposal."=20
Abraham's office did not return calls seeking comment.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that will likely weigh the fate of=
=20
the plan, however, is independent of Abraham's office. Even so, Abraham is=

part of an energy policy team appointed by Bush, and Davis views Abraham's=

support of the proposal as a potential key to a federal nod.=20
Davis' history with the commission won't help his efforts. He and the=20
commission have been at odds for months over the governor's campaign to=20
impose tough wholesale price caps in the West.=20
The latest complications in the plan to rescue utilities came amid a=20
continuing deadlock in secret negotiations between the state and the Pacifi=
c,=20
Gas and Electric Co., which is reluctant to sell its high-voltage=20
transmission lines.=20
Davis announced Friday that California's other major investor-owned utility=

Southern California Edison, had agreed on the basic framework of a deal tha=
t=20
includes the sale of its transmission grid to the state for $2.8 billion.=
=20
The utilities, trapped between high wholesale costs and lower=20
government-frozen retail rates, have been pushed to the brink of bankruptcy=

as they amassed nearly $13 billion in debt.=20
When the utilities could no longer buy enough power, the state began=20

thwart rolling blackouts.=20
Then Davis and legislators began developing strategies to ease the energy=

crisis, including increased conservation, construction of new generation=20

Under Davis' plan to rescue utilities, the state would help fiscally restor=

Energy chief 'open' to plan on transmission line buy out
By Toby Eckert=20
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE=20
February 28, 2001=20

WASHINGTON -- Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham is "open" to California's pl=
an=20
to take over utility transmission lines in the state, but stopped short of=
=20
endorsing the proposal, saying he needed to study it further, Gov. Gray Dav=
is=20
said yesterday.=20
"From the tone of his remarks, I think his comments will be positive, and I=
=20
hope by the end of the week he will be able to endorse the proposal or at=
=20
least endorse a modified proposal that is satisfactory to us," Davis said=
=20
after meeting with Abraham privately at the Department of Energy.=20
A spokesman for Abraham said he "couldn't characterize (Abraham's) reaction=
=20
one way or the other." But he said Abraham was "open to taking a look at th=
e=20
material the governor provided" and would follow up with Davis.=20
In his effort to drum up federal support for the buyout plan, Davis also=20
invoked a name that resonates throughout the halls of power in Washington:=
=20
Alan Greenspan.=20
Davis said the Federal Reserve Board chairman "in a general way thinks it=
=20
makes sense to acquire transmission lines to make the capacity improvements=
=20
that have not been done over the past 15 years."=20
Greenspan and Davis informally talked about the power crisis this week, aid=
es=20
to Davis said. Greenspan's comments could not be confirmed independently.=
=20
Davis was in Washington for the four-day winter meeting of the National=20
Governors Association. But he also used the occasion to try to convince the=
=20
new Bush administration -- and the media -- that his plans to solve=20
California's power woes are sound.=20
The governor spent about an hour briefing Abraham on the tentative agreemen=
t=20
the state struck last week to acquire Southern California Edison's=20
transmission system for $2.76 billion. The state is trying to negotiate=20
similar deals with San Diego Gas and Electric and Pacific Gas and Electric =
as=20
a condition for helping the utilities pay off about $13 billion in debt the=
y=20
have accumulated because of soaring wholesale power costs.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission probably will have to sign off on=
=20
any purchase plans, and FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert has made comments=20
indicating he is skeptical of the idea. But Davis believes he can overcome=
=20
possible opposition at FERC if Abraham backs the plans.=20
Davis also said he and Abraham had "some creative talks about how we might =
be=20
able to find more megawatts for this summer" and assigned staff members to=
=20
work on that "on a daily basis." He did not elaborate on the ideas, saying=
=20
there may be some details forthcoming "in about two to three weeks."=20
The governor will continue his East Coast sales pitch for the transmission=
=20
line purchase -- and other elements of his plan to solve the power crisis -=
-=20
in a meeting with Wall Street analysts and bond-raters today.=20
Davis and legislators also have pursued long-term power contracts with ener=
gy=20
suppliers to wean the state from the open market, which became wildly=20
expensive last year.=20
Mirant Corp., which operates power plants in Northern California, said=20
yesterday that it has agreed to shift contracts from the defunct California=
=20
Power Exchange to the Department of Water Resources, which is the state's=
=20
electricity buyer.=20
The contracts amount to about 1,000 megawatts of power over the next 10=20
months. Last week, Mirant agreed to sell 750 megawatts to the state next=20
month. On a typical winter day, the maximum demand on the grid managed by t=
he=20
state Independent System Operator, about 75 percent of the total state=20
network, is about 30,000 megawatts.=20
Davis' visit to Washington came against the backdrop of a muted federal=20
response to California's power crisis. The Bush administration, which favor=
s=20
open power markets, has said it is largely up to state officials to solve t=
he=20
problem, rejecting calls by Davis for more aggressive action like caps on=
=20
wholesale power costs.=20
But the Democratic governor praised the Republican president publicly on=20
several occasions. He cited the administration's temporary extension of=20
federal orders that kept electricity and gas flowing to the state during=20
emergency shortages and its agreement to speed up federal review of new pow=
er=20
plants.=20
"Secretary Abraham and the Bush administration in general have been=20
wonderfully responsive to my requests. I cannot thank them enough," Davis=
=20
said yesterday.=20
Other California Democrats have been less charitable toward President Bush.=
=20
"I think the president is going in the wrong direction on this issue," said=
=20
Rep. Bob Filner, D-San Diego, a staunch advocate of wholesale price control=
s.=20
"A hands-off approach by the federal government, as the president has=20
suggested, is not going to solve this problem."

Energy Experts Belie Davis' Rosy Prediction
Summer expected to be crunch time=20
Greg Lucas, Sacramento Bureau Chief
Wednesday,?February 28, 2001=20
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle=20
Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis' optimistic assessment that California may be=
=20
on the "back side" of its energy crisis flies in the face of what many ener=
gy=20
companies and other experts predict.=20
California's real test will come this summer when electricity usage sharply=
=20
increases, and unless everything breaks the way Davis hopes, predictions ar=
e=20
that large chunks of the state will be in the dark.=20
"We're not on the back side of this crisis. This problem is far, far bigger=
=20
than the governor is suggesting," said Gary Ackerman, executive director fo=
r=20
the Western Power Trading Forum in Menlo Park.=20
"To characterize the problem that way shows a recklessness that feeds on th=
e=20
popular notion we don't have an energy crisis. We do. We have a very seriou=
s=20
one that's going to hit us as temperatures and loads go up," Ackerman said.=
=20
The Democratic governor's comments were made Monday in Washington, D.C.,=20
during an East Coast visit aimed at getting Washington and Wall Street=20
support for his energy plan.=20
He admitted more hard work is needed, but said the state is on the "back si=
de=20
of the crisis" because lawmakers have passed bills needed to help lower=20
electricity prices.=20
"Does that mean we're home free?" Davis asked yesterday. "No."=20
But he again repeated that the state is on the back side of the crisis.=20
That is contrary to predictions by the Independent System Operator, which=
=20
oversees the state's power market.=20
On any given day in June, the ISO estimates, the state will fall 6,815=20
megawatts short of demand. That would put nearly 7 million homes in the dar=
k,=20
if it happens.=20
In July, the expected shortage is 4,685 megawatts. In August, it's 5,297=20
megawatts. That's if California has a normal summer. If it's hotter than=20
normal, the shortage grows.=20
The ISO's estimates tend to be conservative and do not include Davis'=20
conservation goal.=20
But even if a 10 percent reduction were achieved in June that would save=20
roughly 5,000 megawatts, the state would still be short 1,800 megawatts.=20
And there are other variables.=20
Depending on the snowpack and reservoir levels, hydroelectric plants may no=
t=20
be able to run at full bore, which would also worsen the situation.=20
"That is something the governor cannot spin his way out of," said Sen. Tom=
=20
McClintock, R-Northridge.=20
Davis said a combination of new power plants and energy conservation will=
=20
help the state get through this summer.=20
The clock is running. The ISO predicts shortages of 3,030 megawatts in May =
-=20
- just two months away.=20
"The real electricity crisis is going to be this summer, and I don't think=
=20
we've made enough progress there," said Severin Borenstein, director of the=
=20
University of California Energy Institute.=20
California won't be able to build its way out of the energy crisis by quick=
ly=20
approving and building new power plants, Borenstein said.=20
The ISO's demand estimates already factor in the new power plants set to co=
me=20
online this summer.=20
"Unless we have a very mild summer and have lots of rainfall between then a=
nd=20
now," Borenstein said, "we are going to face some serious shortages."=20
Like Davis, Borenstein says California needs to do more to conserve energy.=
=20
Unlike Davis, he favors raising prices on big power consumers to give them =
an=20
incentive to cut back.=20
But the Democratic governor may be sending Californians a mixed message.=20
By telling them the worst is over, he could undercut his plan by making=20
people believe more conservation is unnecessary.=20
Excluding what lies ahead, there are also plenty of energy issues left=20
unresolved right now.=20
Although Davis has reached a tentative deal with Southern California Edison=
=20
on purchasing its share of the state's transmission system for $2.7 billion=
=20
-- no such deal exists with either Pacific Gas & Electric or San Diego Gas =
&=20
Electric.=20
Some alternative energy producers, like co-generation plants, are shutting=
=20
down because the cash-poor utilities haven't paid them for several months. =
No=20
cash means no fuel to run the turbines that make the juice.=20
Generators like Duke Energy and Reliant Energy aren't convinced the crisis=
=20
has passed.=20
For starters, both companies are owed in excess of $700 million for=20
electricity bought by PG&E and Edison but never paid for.=20
"There are a lot of issues still out there such as how much power your stat=
e=20
will require this summer, whether there is enough generation on the ground =
or=20
available commercially to handle the load if there is a significant spike i=
n=20
demand," said Richard Wheatley, a Reliant spokesman.=20
Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights,=
=20
has a slightly different take on whether the worst is over.=20
"We've said all along it's a crisis inspired by the greed of the utilities=
=20
and the energy companies," Rosenfield said.=20
"Now that taxpayers are paying $1 billion every three weeks to buy=20
electricity and the ratepayers are going to pay between $13 billion and $20=

PUC to mull baseline level for electricity
It's been a decade since amounts were set. They vary by region, season and=
=20
whether a home is heated with gas or electricity.

By Robert T. Garrett
The Press-Enterprise
SACRAMENTO
Inland-area residents who want a higher "baseline quantity" of lower-priced=
=20
electricity each month will get a chance to plead their case in the next fe=
w=20
weeks.=20
The state Public Utilities Commission will examine by early April whether t=
he=20
monthly usage limits that trigger higher rates for residential customers ar=
e=20
set too low, PUC President Loretta Lynch said Wednesday.=20
Baseline amounts are set by the PUC and vary by geographic region, season a=
nd=20
whether a home is heated with gas or electricity.=20
"It's been over a decade since the baselines were set," Lynch told the=20
Sacramento Press Club. ". . . I think it's about time for us to look at wha=
t=20
these baselines are in the 21st century."=20
Lynch, an appointee of Gov. Davis, declined to say whether the commission=
=20
will make permanent a 9-percent rate hike imposed in early January on=20
residential customers of Southern California Edison, which serves much of t=
he=20
Inland Empire.=20
With Edison and Pacific Gas Electric collapsing financially, the PUC impose=
d=20
the rate hike -- and increases of up to 17 percent for Edison's large=20
business customers -- for 90 days.=20
The "temporary surcharge" will be lifted in early April unless the PUC vote=
s=20
to keep it in effect.=20
Davis has said he hopes his plan to rescue the state's ailing utilities and=
=20
avoid rolling blackouts can be carried out without further rate hikes.=20
Davis was in New York City on Wednesday, where the plan drew a tepid respon=
se=20
from Wall Street.=20
Meanwhile, the unexpected shutdown of four Western power plants for repairs=
,=20
combined with scheduled maintenance at several in-state plants, forced=20
California grid officials to declare a Stage 2 alert.=20
Wall Street analysts who met privately with Davis in New York called his=20
moves a good step toward solving the energy crisis, but said more must be=
=20
done.=20
"He talked about a lot of short-term measures to alleviate problems for thi=
s=20
summer, but he hasn't communicated a long-term fix," said Lawrence J.=20
Makovich, senior director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates.=20
Lynch said Wednesday that she and others on the PUC should have recognized=
=20
sooner that utility deregulation wasn't working.=20
As part of its review of the January rate hikes, the PUC will invite public=
=20
comments on baselines, Lynch said.=20
She said she plans to examine the baselines for each climate zone. In=20
Edison's service area, for instance, there are six.=20
Lynch also said the PUC would look at whether baselines are fair and=20
effective, and whether similar incentives to conserve energy should be buil=
t=20
into the rates of businesses.=20
If the commission adopts "incentives for businesses," she said, it has to=
=20
make sure it doesn't set the baseline quantities too low for industrial=20
sectors such as agriculture and biotechnology. State Sen. Jim Battin, R-La=
=20
Quinta, said Lynch's proposed review of the fairness of baselines in the=20
different climate zones "could be encouraging."=20
But he said he thinks businesses will oppose having baselines applied to=20
them.=20
Battin has waged a battle against baselines, which he calls "social=20
engineering" and which were mandated by a state law passed in the 1980s.=20
In the Inland area, the baseline system works like this:=20
In Temecula and Corona an "all-electric" home -- meaning one that is heated=
=20
by electricity -- this summer will pay 12 cents a kilowatt for the first 30=
4=20
kilowatts used each month; for each additional kilowatt consumed, Edison wi=
ll=20
charge 14 cents.=20
In Moreno Valley, Hemet, Rialto and most of Redlands, owners of=20
"all-electric" homes will pay Edison the lower rate for 514 kilowatts per=
=20
month this summer.=20
In the Coachella Valley, in both summer and winter, Edison charges the=20
higher, 14-cent rate only for monthly consumption above 1,299 kilowatts.=20
Those with gas heating in their homes get different baseline allowances tha=
n=20
do those with electric heating.=20

"From my perspective, the system that we created was built on a theory and =

As for Lynch, she challenged several popular assumptions as myths. First, s=

said, deregulation failed on its own, not because politicians cut it short.=

Second, she said, the PUC did not stop utilities from arranging long-term=

And, the defense of the PUC's rate freeze in court is not a losing=20
proposition, she said.=20
"It is true that the utilities came to the commission and to me personally =

we=20

But Lynch said if the PUC had lifted the rate freeze, "we would have, by=20

that San Diego experienced this summer."=20
As it is, the commission is studying the market value of the assets Souther=

Cal-ISO Says Suppliers Overcharged=20

Power: State report calls for a refund of $562 million above 'reasonable'=
=20
prices. Generators deny gouging.=20

By NANCY VOGEL and JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writers


?????SACRAMENTO--Wholesale electricity suppliers overcharged California's=
=20
utilities more than $500 million during December and January, an amount tha=
t=20
the federal government should demand be refunded, according to a=20
no-holds-barred state report released Thursday.
?????The report by the California Independent System Operator, which overse=
es=20
the flow of electricity in the state, said power suppliers charged $11=20
billion during those two months alone--more than they did for all of 1999.
?????Studying various market dynamics, the agency concluded that there was =
a=20
"prima facie case" that the unnamed generators and marketers had charged $5=
62=20
million above "just and reasonable" prices, warranting further investigatio=
n=20
and federal hearings into the appropriateness of refunds.
?????The state report is the most accusatory of a number of studies=20
undertaken to determine why wholesale electricity prices have soared in=20
California since last summer, throwing the state's biggest utilities into=
=20
financial crisis and dashing hopes for lower consumer rates under=20
deregulation.
?????The study also provides new ammunition to members of California's=20
congressional delegation, who have unsuccessfully been pressing the Federal=
=20
Energy Regulatory Commission to impose price ceilings on wholesale=20
electricity costs.
?????Generators defended their operating practices and rejected the=20
allegation that they had raked in unfairly large profits in December and=20
January.
?????"We have played by the rules, acted ethically and legally in all our=
=20
operations," said Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Houston-based Reliant=
=20
Energy, which owns power plants capable of supplying more than 3 million=20
homes. "We have nothing to hide."
?????Gary Ackerman, executive direcor of the Western Power Trading Forum,=
=20
said the Cal-ISO report does not account for less tangible factors that ten=
d=20
to drive up prices, such as political and financial uncertainties.
?????"Those are the things my people take into account when deciding whethe=
r=20
to sell into California," said Ackerman. He noted that, in the second week =
of=20
December, a period analyzed in the Cal-ISO report, electricity prices were=
=20
higher in the Pacific Northwest than in California.
?????The report, he said, "provides some reasonable questions which will be=
=20
responded to by my members, under FERC authority."
?????Cal-ISO officials stressed Thursday that they are not accusing any=20
seller of inflating prices but are simply asking for federal action to=20
restrain costs.
?????"We have not seen prices come down to what we feel are justifiable=20
levels," said Anjali Sheffrin, director of market analysis for Cal-ISO.
?????Although federal energy commission officials on Thursday refused to=20
comment on the study, many experts predicted that refunds would not be=20
forthcoming.
?????Since July, when Gov. Gray Davis first asked the federal commission to=
=20
give San Diego Gas & Electric customers refunds for electricity costs that=
=20
doubled and in some cases tripled, the agency has refused to order power=20
sellers to give back some of their profits to California utilities and=20
consumers.
?????The commission, charged by Congress with assuring "just and reasonable=
"=20
wholesale electricity rates, has also resisted imposing firm price caps on=
=20
California's electricity market. In November, the commission called that=20
market "dysfunctional" and vulnerable to manipulation by power sellers, but=
=20
the agency has so far failed to document or punish specific cases of such=
=20
anti-competitive behavior.
?????"The real question is what is FERC going to do with all of this?" said=
=20
Gary Stern, chief of market analysis for Southern California Edison, once o=
ne=20
of the two biggest buyers of electricity in California. "Based on past=20
history, we think they're probably going to say they don't see wrongdoing=
=20
that provides a reason for refund."
?????Determining rebates could prove a logistical nightmare for federal=20
regulators and Cal-ISO, Stern said, but the data exist to show how much it=
=20
cost power plant owners to generate electricity and what price they charged=
.
?????Given that Edison and PG&E have defaulted on payments of hundreds of=
=20
millions to power sellers, Stern said, a rebate order wouldn't lead to=20
reimbursement for individual utility customers. Instead, it could help the=
=20
utilities eliminate some of their debt to generators and marketers.
?????Edison and PG&E have been pushed nearly to bankruptcy by high wholesal=
e=20
costs, which they could not pass on to their customers because of a=20
state-imposed rate freeze.=20
?????Last week, Davis announced that Edison had agreed in principle to stat=
e=20
financial help in exchange for its transmission lines. Negotiations with PG=
&E=20
continue.
?????The Folsom-based Cal-ISO drew its conclusions after reviewing=20
electricity purchases made between Dec. 8, 2000, and Jan. 31, 2001.
?????To calculate the cost of producing electricity in those months, Cal-IS=
O=20
analysts assumed power plant owners were buying natural gas from the spot=
=20
market, where prices soared this winter, and were running old, inefficient=
=20
plants. They also assumed relatively high prices for air emission credits i=
n=20
Southern California and added a 10% buffer to the operating costs.
?????Cal-ISO officials then compared these costs with the prices sellers we=
re=20
paid. Their report did not name the individual sellers, which range from th=
e=20
province of British Columbia to the publicly owned Los Angeles Department o=
f=20
Water and Power to private companies.
?????Several lawmakers praised the report as long overdue.
?????"It's about time," said state Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey),=20
chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee. She said that the desire among=
=20
some legislators to seize power plants and take other drastic actions stems=
=20
from the sense that "there's no one willing to enforce the provisions of th=
e=20
federal power act regarding just and reasonable rates.
?????"The utilities are doing a great job looking out for their shareholder=
s,=20
but who is looking out for ratepayers?" she asked.
?????Consumer advocacy groups applauded Cal-ISO's action and said the=20
agency's evidence of overcharges underscored the need for hard price caps o=
r=20
a tax on generator profits.
?????"It's certainly not news to us that the generators are charging=20
excessive wholesale prices," said Mindy Spatt, spokeswoman for the Utility=
=20
Reform Network of San Francisco. "If there had been a real price cap, this=
=20
investigation would not be necessary."=20
?????California's congressional delegation has pushed hard in recent months=
=20
for legislation that would impose temporary price controls on wholesale pow=
er=20
supplies in the West. On Wednesday, a bipartisan team met with Curtis Heber=
t,=20
chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and came away=20
discouraged by Hebert's opposition to price caps.
?????The federal commission has imposed a so-called "soft cap" of $150 per=
=20
megawatt-hour in California's electricity market. When sellers ask a higher=
=20
price they must explain why it is necessary.=20
?????Within 60 days, the commission can launch a review of those bids that=

could lead to refunds. So far, the federal panel has ordered none. On=20
Thursday, Cal-ISO asked the commission to extend the two-month deadline in=

Steven Kean, executive vice president of Enron Corp., said he didn't see "a=

it's not open to negotiation."=20
But Bowen and others say generators, bondholders and other utility creditor=
s=20
have some good reasons to budge.=20
If Edison and PG&E go bankrupt, Bowen says, the generators might have to wa=
it=20

Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Davis, said the governor "has received a=20

Because of that divesture, much of California's power is controlled by=20
out-of-state generators and their trading subsidiaries, or by independent=

"I don't think they have a whole lot of chance with FERC," said Severin=20
Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute.=20
Federal officials, he said, "are likely to bend over backward to excuse the=

prices."=20
Wholesalers also doubted the ISO report would lead anywhere, saying it left=

out significant, legitimate costs of selling electricity to California.=20
Suppliers had the right to charge a "credit premium" as the risks of=20
nonpayment began rising, said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading=20
Forum. Not only did the ISO become an uncreditworthy buyer -- because it go=
t=20
its money from Edison and PG&E -- but the whole political climate in=20
California added to the wholesalers' risks, Ackerman said.=20
Whether or not the ISO filing prompts action from federal regulators, it=20
could help lawmakers pressure the generators.=20
State Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, said he wants to sort out how much of the=
=20
debts piled up by PG&E and Edison since last summer were the result of=20
electricity prices that could be deemed "unjust and unreasonable" under=20
federal and state laws.=20
"Since every regulatory body has concluded those costs were unjust and=20
unreasonable, a portion, if not a very significant part of that past debt=

Some analysts say state leaders can't push the generators too far, since th=

Dunn acknowledges that is a concern, but says the Legislature also can't=20

"That is the game of chicken we are in now," Dunn said. "And up to this=20

The issue of debt forgiveness could become moot if Davis can't strike a dea=

Baker & McKenzie's Gottlieb.=20

"FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert has used the word 'nationalization' publicly t=

One of those conditions may be a trade-off: FERC will approve California's=

A 'quick' fix could take months
No one, including Davis, sees this plan happening quickly. In a presentatio=

Thus, the entire process may not be over for at least another six weeks, an=

even then the Davis plan could face a ballot initiative. But for the sake o=

argument, assume Gov. Davis gets his way and takes control of the=20

"All things add up to a pretty grim situation," said the Reason Public Poli=

"I'm very dubious; the government-run utility in the long-run will be very=

Energy Is Hot
By Christopher Edmonds 
Special to TheStreet.com
9/20/00 12:47 PM ET 
URL: http://www.thestreet.com/comment/christopheredmonds/1088836.html
HOUSTON -- Up and to the right. 
That could be the theme of the eighth annual Dain Rauscher Wessels energy 
conference this week in America's self-proclaimed oil capital. Between the 
whispers in the hallways and the bullish presentations from an overflowing 
barrel of oil, gas and power companies, you might think you were in the 
corridors of some Silicon Valley conference of yesteryear. 
But, no, this is all about energy, and energy is hot. With oil hanging around 
$37 per barrel and natural gas solidly above $5 per million BTU, oil, gas and 
power stocks have caught fire. To illustrate, take a look at the chart of the 
Philadelphia Stock Exchange Oil Service Sector Index, or OSX: 

Up and to the right. And, a great deal of the price gain is rational. As the 
price of the commodities increases, profits follow. That should mean positive 
earnings from a plethora of oil and gas companies. 
While new Securities and Exchange Commission regulations have stifled the 
more explicit (now illicit) preannouncements at conferences like this, 
regulations can't cap all the enthusiasm from rising commodity prices. For 
example, Kenneth Lay, chairman of energy powerhouse Enron (ENE:NYSE), said at 
the conference he is very comfortable with analysts' estimates, hinting the 
numbers are conservative. "We should meet or exceed analysts' expectations 
for the quarter and the year." 
Others followed suit. Bradley Fischer, president of CMS Energy Oil and Gas 
(CMS:NYSE), (profiled here earlier ), said his company will post "record 
production and record income this year," because the fundamentals of the oil 
and gas business are as good as they have been in his career. "I've been in 
this business 28 years. The first 10 were good and the last 18 have been 
difficult. Now, I'm looking for the good times to roll." 
And this from Diana Naylor, senior vice president at independent power 
producer Calpine (CPN:NYSE), when reacting to analysts' estimates in the 
coming year. "We look to be making that number and look to increase that 
[guidance on earnings] shortly." 
Even the oil drillers and equipment companies are celebrating. Nabors 
Industries (NBR:AMEX), owner of the largest land-drilling fleet, thinks 
analysts are significantly underestimating its potential. Dain Rauscher 
estimates Nabors will earn 83 cents per share this year and $1.65 next year 
-- numbers Chairman and CEO Eugene Isenberg called conservative. He presented 
calculations suggesting the company could earn $3.27 in the middle of the oil 
cycle and has the ability to earn $6.81 in the coming years. "The probability 
of this happening is very high," he said. 
All because of $37 per barrel oil and $5 gas? While there is little question 
that third- and fourth-quarter earnings should be strong, there is growing 
concern that the oil and gas stock rally has been overdone. Not only have 
stocks tracked the rise in commodity prices but the once-beleaguered sector 
has also seen earnings multiples expand significantly. 
That is a warning sign to at least one analyst. While the going is good, the 
rapid price rise isn't sustainable. Oil stocks stocks "will peak in the next 
several weeks and trade sideways, probably for the rest of the year," said 
Jim Wicklund, head of energy research at Dain Rauscher, adding that there may 
be added selling pressure as funds try to lock in gains before the end of the 
year. "Stock [price pressure] will also be impacted by portfolio managers' 
bonus structure." 
And Wicklund warned that what he sees as the inevitable moderation in oil 
prices will put pressure on the stocks into the new year. "Right or wrong, 
stock prices are slaves to commodity prices." 
If Wicklund is correct, the next move could be down and to the left. 
The Peoples Court
One of the clever and unique features of the Dain Rauscher Wessels energy 
conference is the annual investor poll. This year, nearly 400 investors 
responded to the on-site survey and, while the results aren't scientific, 
they are likely instructive.

Investors see oil prices moderating a little between now and December and 
further into next year. However, survey participants do not see the same 
pattern for natural gas, with estimates for gas prices remaining well above 
$4.50 through next year. 
And what may at first appear to be good news for George W. Bush probably 
isn't. A six-point lead looks nice, but remember -- we're on his home turf, 
Texas, among his brethren in the oil business. 
For W., that may suggest down and to the left as well.

I may have missed it in your many e-mails, but if you had not seen it, The 
Economist of 26 August has an excellent piece on the lessons of California 
(p. 16 of European edition).  California botched it, Pennsylvania did better, 
and California's problems are no reason to shrink from deregulation.   mcs

Gore favors `Big Power'

September 25, 2000

BY ROBERT NOVAK SUN-TIMES COLUMNIST
Al Gore's $75 billion energy plan contains a $68 billion federal subsidy to
help electric power companies make their plants environmentally friendly.
Therein lies the dark side of the vice president's brand of populism.

The power subsidy proposal was drafted by a Washington energy consultant who
is one of Gore's closest advisers on the environment. One of the major
beneficiaries of the plan would be a power company notorious for polluting
the atmosphere. To close the circle, the company has used the Gore adviser
as a paid consultant.

In polishing up his energy program, Gore played a variation on his Los
Angeles acceptance speech's populistic attack on certain categories of
business that have broken no law. This time, the target was the energy
industry ("Big Oil"), assailed for benefitting from the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries' manipulation of oil prices. But Gore is no
across-the-board enemy of corporate America. He always takes care of
friends. While positioning himself as the foe of Big Oil, he emerges as the
friend of Big Power.

In that category is American Electric Power, based in Columbus, Ohio, and
one of the Midwest's biggest supplier of coal-generated power. AEP, sued by
the Environmental Protection Agency last year for alleged violation of the
Clear Air Act, is widely viewed as a pariah by the environmentalist
movement. It is accused of running one of the dirtiest operations to
generate power.

AEP frequently has paid for advice from environmental advocate Kathleen A.
McGinty, who has an unusual resume indeed. As senior legislative assistant
for energy and environmental policy to then-Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of
Tennessee, she quickly gained a reputation on Capitol Hill as a passionate
advocate for global climate control.

Gore picked her for Clinton administration posts, enabling her to affect
national policy in a major way. In 1993, she was named to head the new White
House Office on Environmental Policy. In 1996, she was promoted to head the
Council on Environmental Quality and became a leader in trying to sell to
America the massively unpopular 1997 Gore-promoted Kyoto Treaty (never
considered by the Senate) to slash energy consumption.

Last year, McGinty emerged as a consultant with the law and lobbying firm of
Troutman Sanders. There, she has been engaged in an interesting balancing
act. On the one hand, she advised AEP and the Atlanta-based Southern Co.,
another power giant. On the other, she moonlighted for Gore in drafting the
June 27 energy plan. Since July, she has been working full time for the
Democratic National Committee.

Gore's plan promises to "clean up the nation's aging power plants by using
market-based enforcement and comprehensive standards to reduce pollution and
increase efficiency." It offers "a menu of financial mechanisms" to "those
power plants and industries that come forward with projects that promise to
dramatically reduce climate and health-threatening pollution."

That means a big subsidy for electric power companies to help them clean up
their plants. According to congressional energy sources, AEP would receive
millions of dollars to get right environmentally.

Gore always has shown ability to reward individual corporate friends while
castigating big business as predators. I previously reported that he had
supported permission for deep oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico,
desired only by Occidental Petroleum Corp., the source of much of his
family's wealth.

But federal help for Occidental and American Power and the potential for
conflicts of interest fly beneath the radar in a capital where the hands of
neither political party are clean. It is possible for Gore's diluted brand
of populism to flourish because it is the way Washington works.

		 Subject: Re: Dereg Articles

I've taken the editor's pencil to Dan's draft.  Here's the result:

 Kirk Johnson's September 26th article, Debate on Need for New Power Plants 
Ignores Conservation, leaves readers with the misperception that competitive 
electricity markets discourage conservation.  True customer choice proves 
otherwise.
 My company supplies electricity to a number of businesses in Maine.  One of 
these customers is a  paper mill that uses more electricity than thousands of 
homes.  When New England power prices temporarily spiked last May, we 
actually paid the mill to shut down ... which they were more than happy to 
do.  As a result, the customer made money, the grid worked better, and 
residential customers didn't hear a word about "brownouts."
 The financial rewards in the open market create much better incentives to 
conserve than do the bureaucratic, one-size-fits-all programs of the 
regulatory elite.  It's proving true in Maine, why not give New York and 
other states the same choice?

If you like it, send it to the Letters to the Editor section at the New York 
Times.  The protocol is on the editorial page.

Thanks for the quick response, 

Mark

Subject: EGEP Sale Announcement

On Friday (last night Houston time) we announced Enron's decision to sell 
Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd. (EOGIL), our subsidary that owns a 30% interest in 
the Panna, Mukta and Tapti concession areas.    We now have bankers involved 
and a data room is being prepared in Houston which  made it extremely 
difficult to keep the deal quiet any longer.  There were a rumors circulating 
through the office, but the reality of the announcement was still a shock to 
most of the employees in India and Houston.  Attached is a memo we handed out 
to employees, but basically we said the following:
 1) Selling assets or companies is a routine part of Enron's strategy to 
redeploy capital in the higher return opportunities.  The company has 
exposure to a number of tremendous opportunities today that were not 
envisioned even twelve months ago.  In line with this strategy, we are 
placing EOGIL in the market.
 2) Depending on the success of finding an acceptable buyer for EOGIL,  we 
will be reviewing the balance of our portfolio for transfer to other Enron 
entities or for sale as separate packages.  We anticipate closing the EOGIL 
transaction and rationalizing the remaining portfolio by March 31, 2001.  
 3) Pending the success outlined in item #2, we will eliminate Enron Global 
E&P as an Enron business unit on March 31, 2001.
 4) We announced some interim staff changes to facilitate the process. 
  a) Jeff Sherrick would re-focus his time largely on the sale process
  b) Mike Stewart will be responsible for all India activity except the sale 
process
  c) Steve Harper will be responsible for EGEP's sale activity and 
coordination with our bankers and Corporate Development
 5) Commented on the potential impact to employees in general terms.  We told 
them it was pre-mature to outline all of the possibilities until we signed a 
PSA with a buyer.  However, in general, there is a good likelihood that many 
people will either have opportunities for future employment with the buyers 
or through redeployment within Enron.  Those people that do not remain with 
the assets or are not redeployed in Enron will be involuntarily terminated 
March 31, 2001 unless they are needed to close a transaction or to provide 
transition services to a buyer.
 
I would like to keep this as low-keyed as possible.  Last year when we were 
for sale there were not a lot of comments, but you never know.  If anyone in 
the media picks up on this I would expect it to happen early next week.  Mike 
Stewart is currently in India in the Mumbai office (01191228395841) and can 
be reached at the Mariott after-hours(01191228577878).  He is fully briefed 
on our position regarding the activities within EGEP and EOGIL.  Mike will be 
traveling offshore and to Baroda over the weekend and on Monday.  I will be 
available all weekend and next week at the following numbers; (work) 
713-853-5934, (home) 281-320-2198, (cell) 713-569-4713.  I would suggest 
talking with Mike or I before making any comments to the media if possible.

This afternoon I notified our partners and thr Gov't of India of our 
intention to market our assets.  I will be making a trip to India soon to 
visit with the appropriate people in these organizations within the next two 
weeks.  While I wouldn't expect this to happen, please refer any inquiries 
from our partners (ONGC and Reliance) or the GOI to Mike or me.  As you might 
expect, we want to be careful and consistent in our message to these 
groups.   

I will keep you informed regarding any changes to the above.  If you have any 
questions, contact me at the above numbers.

Subject: RED Index shows Texas, NY, and Maine advance on retreating 
Pennsylvania

Note to Steven Kean

The July Update to the Retail Energy Deregulation Index (RED Index),
published twice a year by the Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets
(CAEM) shows Texas, Maine, and New York are making the most measurable
strides in promoting sustainable competition among electricity providers, as
customers throughout Pennsylvania retreat to their default providers due to
increasing wholesale prices.

The RED Index, which is the only known tool that objectively ranks states by
22 attributes on how they are restructuring their power markets, today
released the U.S. rankings for all 50 states and the District of Columbia,
in a 187 page report.  Key results included:
   1. Pennsylvania      66
   2. Texas         65
   3. New York         64
   4. Maine         62
   17. California         34

"These numbers underscore the importance of building a healthy foundation on
which electric competition can grow," said Ken Malloy, CEO of the Center.

"While California's crisis has brought a lot of positive attention to
Pennsylvania's model, many customers in the Keystone State are returning to
their original utility suppliers.  It underscores how important it is to put
the right fundamentals in place if consumers and suppliers are to benefit
over the long haul," Malloy said.

In rankings that included all of North America, the province of Alberta
actually would rank above all the states with a score of 68.

The mid-year RED Index also found that 62% of states expressing an opinion
indicated that their commission is not "less likely to take action on energy
restructuring as a result of the California crisis."

CAEM is an independent, nonprofit, think tank based in Washington, DC whose
mission is to promote an effective transition from the monopoly to the
competitive model of regulation.

Steve,

This meeting was initiated by one of our contacts at the DOE (with whom we 
have a dialogue relating to energy technology).  Some of Dr. Boyce's (do you 
know this guy) topics we can clearly cover, others are a little bit outside 
what Principal Investments does on a day to day basis.  

Could you give me some guidance about who should attend this meeting?  Should 
you be there?  Where I really  need help is on the topic of Natural Gas 
Infrastructure Reliability.

Please call if you have any questions.

Dear Mr. Miller:

It was a pleasure speaking to you and discussing the upcoming meetings with
DOE.

The US Department of Energy, want to meet with ENRON Executives  to discuss
some of the potential of various Energy Programs that are being considered
by  the Office of Strategic Center for Natural Gas, and with Abbie Layne
Product Manager-Advanced Heat Engines.

Mr. Anderson
Product Manager
Natural Gas Infrastructure Reliability
Would like to discus some of the following topics:

 Expected increases in the use of natural gas and projected availability of
this fuel.

? Any special issues associated with distributed generation that could be
addressed with new technologies;

? Concerns about the current price and availability of natural gas causing
on new gas-fired power initiatives;

? Interdependence issues between gas and electric power;

? Any specific natural gas infrastructure issues facing these companies;

? The most important issue concerning natural gas reliability;

? Leadership in R&D;

? Future technology needs; and

? The NETL role in technology development to meet future industry needs.

Mark Williams
Product Manager
Fuel Cells
Would like to discus some of the following topics:

  Fuel Cell Distributed Generation (DG) benefits.

? DG deployment allows critical industry to stay at current location even if
local grid is unstable and unreliable;

? DG deployment obviates need for R&D investment;

? Fuel cell DG deployment means being able to site power with no air
permitting required;

? High fuel cell efficiency reduces operating costs for fuel, which is
important where gas is expensive.  Additionally,  high efficiency
utilization frees up natural gas for use at other critical locations;

? Use of zero or low emission fuel cell technology in environmentally
constrained areas permits continued use of other  high emitting generating
plants, thus increasing the overall power available;
?
 Fuel cell DG deployment puts the highest quality power in the system
increasing grid reliability and stability; and

? Fuel cell attributes also enhance grid reliability through lower
harmonics, variability control, and voltage control.

Abbie Layne Product Manager-
Advanced Heat Engines.
Would like to discus some of the following topics:

 New developments in Gas Turbines

 Increasing Reliability and Maintainability of Gas Turbines

 Combined Cycle Power Plants Increasing Efficiency

 Hybrid Power Systems

 Condition Monitoring Systems.


This meeting would be for about 3-4 hours at ENRON's  facilities. The
meetings  arranged for March 6 morning..

A dinner for the DOE is planned at our home at the Huntingdon 2121 Kirby
Drive, for March 7, 2001 at 7:00 pm, and you and your spouse, and other
executives from ENRON are invited.

I am looking forward to meeting with you.

With best regards,


Dr. Meherwan P. Boyce, P.E.

Fuel Cells Get Financial Boost from U.S. Government
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The Department of Energy will have more than $100 million for fuel cell=20
related programs in the new fiscal year, $10 million above the president's=
=20
request. The money is contained in the Interior Appropriation bill that=20
President Clinton signed last week. The House and Senate jointly agreed=20
upon $52.7 million for stationary fuel cells, $10 million more than=20
requested,=20
and approved the full request of $41.5 million for transportation fuel=20
cell research and $5.5 million for buildings.

ANALYSIS: This government funding, which is surprisingly higher than=20
expected,=20
should give a much-needed boost to the slow-moving development of fuel=20
cells. Although generally considered the favorite of low / zero emission=20
energy solutions, fuel cells are still about two to three years away from=
=20
being commercially viable in retail markets. (Phosphoric acid fuel cells,=
=20
developed by ONSI, a division of United Technologies, are presently availab=
le=20
in a limited capacity). The technology has been in existence ever since=20
batteries were discovered 160 years ago, but the high cost of producing=20
them has precluded suppliers from making fuel cells readily available to=20
the general public. Automotive giants like DaimlerChrysler and Ford Motor=
=20
Co. have continued to explore the use of fuel cells in automobiles, and=20
Texaco, Inc. agreed in May to invest $67.2 million in Energy Conversion=20
Devices, a 40-year-old fuel cell and alternative energy development firm.=
=20
Yet, this financial support for the DOE's exploration of fuel cells signals=
=20
significant support from the federal government. In addition, warnings=20
about the high cost of oil and natural gas, and the reports of low supplies=
=20
of energy in states across the country, continue to scare energy end-users=
=20
and may be spurring a renewed interest in distributed generation options.

Here's how fuel cells work. They use an electrochemical reaction, as oppose=
d=20
to traditional combustion, to generate electricity. In other words, fuel=20
cells allow hydrogen-rich fuels to react chemically with air, without=20
burning,=20
producing as a byproduct DC electricity, water and heat. In addition, fuel=
=20
cells dramatically lower the level of pollutants that are emitted into=20
the environment. Test models of fuel cells presently convert methanol,=20
gasoline and natural gas to produce hydrogen fuel. It's easiest to think=20
of a fuel cell as a battery, but one that does not run down or need=20
recharging=20
(although it will need replacing about every five years). A fuel cell will=
=20
produce energy in the form of DC electricity and heat as long as fuel is=20
supplied. As an added advantage, fuel cells can be controlled remotely=20
by computer and run rather quietly. This is perhaps the primary incentive=
=20
for end-users that would be interested in fuel cell technology. Especially=
=20
for facilities like hospitals, the attributes of low noise and near-zero=20
pollution are very appealing.

Currently, fuel cells are being tested and developed by laboratories and=20
think tanks around the world, hoping to make this low-polluting form of=20
generation available for widespread use by 2002 or 2003. Under the DOE=20
grant, money provided for stationary fuel cells will fund research and=20
development to reduce costs and improve performance. It is hoped that this=
=20
will lead to market-ready fuel cell power systems within three years. In=20
addition, the funding allocates $41.5 million to transportation fuel cell=
=20
research such as integrating fuel cell stacks with fuel processors and=20
balance-of-plant technologies for testing. This program also will examine=
=20
the technology barriers to fuel-flexible systems for automobile application=
s.=20
The $5.5 million reserved for buildings will go toward developing a prototy=
pe=20
fuel processor, completing the design competition for a 50kW co-generator=
=20
for buildings, and other research and development.

Deregulation has cast light on alternative forms of power supply. As=20
customers=20
possibly decide to use on-site generation as opposed to power delivered=20
across a transmission grid, this dramatically alters the traditional busine=
ss=20
of most energy companies. Large commercial and industrial customers that=20
suddenly opt for fuel cell solutions to their energy needs would have=20
dramatic=20
financial impact on their incumbent energy provider. As a result, many=20
electric utilities and energy providers are investing in fuel cells as=20
a hedge against a possible shrinkage within their own supply businesses.=20
Southern Company is a good example. Just this month, Southern joined Alabam=
a=20
Municipal Electric Authority, Mercedes-Benz U.S. International, Inc., and=
=20
FuelCell Energy in a partnership to "drive a growing interest in fuel cell=
=20
technology." Specifically, Southern is providing funding for a fuel cell=20
plant to be located in the service territory of Alabama Power, a Southern=
=20
subsidiary. The plant will convert pipeline natural gas into electricity=20
at a reported efficiency of about 50 percent, compared with 33 percent=20
for conventional generation, which will feed the power distribution system=
=20
of Mercedes-Benz.

Another example is Enron, which just two weeks ago entered into an alliance=
=20
with FuelCell Energy, Inc., to develop and market FuelCell Energy's Direct=
=20
FuelCell products, focusing on state renewable and energy conservation=20
programs. As part of the partnership, Enron is investing about $5 million=
=20
in the common stock of FuelCell Energy. In its announcement of the=20
partnership,=20
Enron stated that "the transaction enables us to reach the developing marke=
ts=20
for clean energy and renewable energy, which may be served through=20
distributed=20
generation products, such as fuel cells."

These are just two examples of many energy companies that are devoting=20
money to fuel cells and other forms of distributed generation. Some state=
=20
regulatory commissions have debated whether or not to allow utilities to=20
own their own distributed generation equipment technologies. As a result,=
=20
we are seeing a trend of utilities investing in companies that are already=
=20
developing distributed generation solutions, instead of doing it themselves=
.

The investment appears to be a smart one. According to Stephens, Inc.,=20
an investment banking firm, common industry projections put the potential=
=20
for the automotive fuel cell market at $50 billion annually by 2020 and=20
as high as $100 billion (cumulative) for the stationary power markets withi=
n=20
10 years. The increase is due in large part to the growth of Internet-based=
=20
industry and the need for mission-critical systems at dot-com operations.=
=20
Microturbines=01*small generators that can produce enough power for a small=
=20
business=01*have beaten fuel cells to market and are currently manufactured=
=20
by the likes of Capstone, Caterpillar and Solar Turbines. Microturbines=20
reportedly could be potentially superior to fuel cells with regard to low=
=20
emissions. Many energy companies and power marketers such as Williams,=20
Alliant Energy and American Energy Savings have made announcements just=20
within the last month that they will market microturbines to customers.=20
Yet, the distributed generation market should become much tighter once=20
fuel cells become commercially available, something that this hefty new=20
grant from the U.S. government should push forward.=20

Hi, Amy - Kelly Kimberly got this letter from a woman she knows who works at 
Harvard, in the Kennedy School of Government, for an initiative called Women

corporate cabinet.  What do you think about her idea below, and Enron's

I have an interesting idea that I wanted to share with you.  Just last week
here at the Kennedy School, I met with a woman named Susan Bird, who sits
on the Women's Leadership Board of the Kennedy School.  She is the Founder
and President of Women.future in New York City, NY.  She headed the launch
of the organization (part of which was held here at KSG, the main body of
which was held in NYC and telecast to KSG).  It was a masterfully conceived
and brilliantly orchestrated three-phase global event for businesswomen.  I
imagine you heard about it.

Susan told me last week that one of her current, burning interests is in
how women business leaders (corporate leadership across the private and
public sectors) can change and influence public policy.  She wants to
create a public venue, invite women business leaders, and discuss the
central question, "If we assume that today's global problems require more
and more from the business world, would these problems look any different
if women business leaders/owners were involved?"

Susan and I wonder if this is something Enron (and/or potentially other
corporate sponsors) would like formally to sponsor.   Furthermore, Susan's
company could video this executive forum, streamline the video, and link it
to the Women Waging Peace Website.  My sense is that it's a win-win for
everyone.

I told her that I would contact you and discuss the possibility.  Would
love to hear your thoughts first, before I engage in further conversation
with Susan.  If this is something in which Enron is interested, I could
easily arrange a phone conversation among Swanee, Susan, you, and me in the
near future to discuss the idea in greater depth.

I am available for a conversation about the idea anytime, and I can be
reached directly at (617) 495-8330.

POSSIBLE DRAFT LETTER TO ROD EDDINGTON at BA FROM KEN LAY
Dear Rod:
    Irwin Stelzer says that he has mentioned to you that the next meeting of 
Enron's advisory council is scheduled for London on October 30 and 31. The 
council includes several prominent permanent members drawn from the  business 
and academic communities, to which we add distinguished guests with expertise 
in areas of interest to us on an ad hoc basis. Several of our top executives 
attend these meetings.
    I am hoping that you might help us in two ways. Irwin tells me that your 
headquarters building is innovative and has many features that it would be 
well worth our while to know about and to study. Would it be possible for you 
to arrange a tour for a few of our executives, both from the US and the UK, 
say on the morning of October 30?
    Second, we understand from Irwin and from the press that you have done 
wonders in reinvigorating and revitalizing the BA staff. I am hoping that you 
might be willing to share some of the secrets of your success with us, 
perhaps at an informal buffet lunch at our new London headquarters on October 
31, or at some other time on that day that might be more convenient for you.
    Let me take this opportunity to congratulate you on what you have 
achieved at BA, in a short time and in a tough market.
                            Sincerely,

Steve and Rick,

This is just to inform you that I have been involved with the Camisea gas 
project in Peru since Shell-Mobil developed it several years ago. As you can 
see in the article below, Enron is one of the possible candidates for getting 
the transportation and distribution contract. I am in continuous contact with 
Roberto Pensotti, the lead developer for the this deal. Roberto knows that I 
have strong contacts in the government and the private sector in Peru, and I 
would be more than happy to help in any way possible. I will keep you posted 
on this issue. Regards, Vinio

Skilling will be speaking at the National Press Club next week.  He'll give 
an overview of Enron's business, talk about what's going on in power markets, 
and what should be done to fix the current problems.  California will get 
covered as well.  Other than what we have already discussed, is there 
anything Jeff should know or address in his remarks?

I just noticed one minor error.  I think that you are trying to highlight 
that Terry Winter, the Chief Executive Officer of the ISO voted against the 
proposal.  In the text, you say the Chairman of the ISO.  There is no 
Chairman of the ISO.  There is a Chairman of the Board of the ISO -- Jan 
Smutney-Jones -- who has consistently voted against the price caps since 
June.  Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.

I realize you have pushed these guys already, but the attached letter would 
be better if not sent at all.  It doesn't address the real underlying problem 
-- that a "reliability bill" on a stand alone basis doesn't fix the problem.  
Instead, the letter implies that the reason for opposition is merely a 
political consideration -- ie that it may reduce Congress' appetite for 
action next year.  If possible, it would be better not to have the letter go 
out at all.

Per my first e-mail, here's MidAmerican's position letter on the stand alone 
Reliability measure.  Seems the best we can do with the utilities who have 
been supporting our position is to have them take a "no position" stance on 
the stand alone bill.

Steve,

I am a lead recruiter at the University of California at Berkeley for
Enron Analyst/Associate program.

I contacted several friends who work at Berkeley and received an invitation
from one of them to make a presentation at the weekly Faculty Seminar
of the Dept. of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research.

The students and faculty members from the business school will be also 
invited.

Berkeley in general, and Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Research in
particular, are important centers of academic research on electricity markets
(S. Oren works very closely with Severin Borenstein).

My presentation will focus on the Analyst/Associate program. I shall  also 
have
an opportunity to discuss the power markets in California (I expect many
questions) before many experts who are very  important to shaping
public opinion and regulatory agenda.

Please, let me know who in you group could help me in preparing this 
presentation
and in presenting  Enron's point of view in a more effective way.


Vince

FYI. The name of my friend who invited me:

Shmuel S. Oren, Professor
Dept. of Industrial Engineering
and Operations Research

I assume we avoid Libya completely.  The question, though, may be how we 
proceed if we are doing business with someone who has activities in Libya.  
Your views please.

Steve,

Itochu Corporation, a Japanese trading company with which we are developing a 
relationship, is considering reactivating its activities in Libya. They have 
identified an opportunity to source LNG from Libya for the purposes of 
importing to Japan, either directly or through an LNG swap.

What is Enron's current policy on dealing with Libya?

kind regards

Proposed edits attached.  Looks good -- I like the references to the energy 
savings... I think we should try to get this story some play in california; 
not necessarily in the media but perhaps with some of the folks we are 
working with in the Gov's office.  Please copy Dasovich and Mccubbin on the 
final.

Extra congratulations on the USA Today story.

Your understanding was correct.  In light of recent changes in the California 
regulatory environment (eg the recent rate order) I don't think it makes 
sense for us to distribute the document at this time, so you can ignore the 
request.  Thanks

Steve: 
Thanks for your note, sorry I missed you.  From your message I think there 
may be some miscommunication between your PR guys and us.  We understood that 
your PR people wanted to reprint the Op-ed and redistribute it to 
as-yet-undetermined people, along with various Enron material.  They also 
wanted to post it on Enron's public web site.
But your message seemed to indicate you just want to post the op-ed on your 
intranet -  for educational use only for your internal folks.  If this is 
correct, we would have no problem with it. In fact, we have posted the op-ed 
on the CERA web page - which is theoretically available to every Enron 
employee for internal use only.  If you want you could just post a link to 
the CERA web site so your people could get direct access to all our research 
on the topic.
If I misunderstood you, and you do want to redistribute the piece to 
third-parties -- that is a much bigger issue because it involves our 
intellectual property and  branding issues.  Obviously, we would need to talk 
some more about this.  I hope this helps.
On a somewhat-related note, we are also getting sucked more and more into the 
California vortex, and being asked to help in areas that are not our 
traditional business, such as expert witness testimony and policy issues.  
While we are not afraid to take a point of view (as you know!) we must 
maintain a neutral and independent posture.  This is sometimes a difficult 
path to navigate, but we are exploring two areas that may also interest Enron:
1. We have examined Joskow and FERC's analysis on the price gouging issue and 
we believe there are several major flaws in their methodologies.  We are 
considering how best to broadcast our assessment, without impinging on our 
core business, or becoming an expert witness.  We think a workshop, similar 
to the Monday event at CERAWeek could work, where we would present our 
findings and issue a report.
2. We are also looking into the economic impact of power outages in the West 
- especially linked to the overall fragile state of the US economy.  This 
would be a collaborative effort with a major economic forecasting firm or 
university.  Again the reults would go to our clients, but could be released 
to a wider audience, and a workshop might help highlight the release.
Please let us know if either topic would be of interest to Enron.  We would 
need to raise funding from various clients to help underwrite the effort , 
but the work would be CERA's independent research and we would stand fully 
behind it.
Hope all is well. ...Peter 
.

Subject:	Monthly Billing - Detail Class 845 / s100105.xls

Year 2000 changes:
Phone charges:  Phones are being charged to the person's company and cost 
center where possible, otherwise rent as before.  The description will start 
with People\ or Room\ unless it was entered manually at the source.
Data connections:  One connection is being charged for each room instead of 
one connection for each port in a room.

Attached  are spreadsheets with the detail supporting the expenses for 
telephones, data ports, EDI, Enterprise LAN, Enterprise Help Desk, video 
conferencing, Internet access, email, and other services provided to Enron 
business units by Enron Information Services. 

EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, 
and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&T 
calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in 
EB or 3AC.  For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by Tammy Anderson 
for this purpose.  

People specific services for employees are billed to the company and cost 
center corresponding to the employee's HR company and department. Video 
conference usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings 
are based on a company and cost center furnished by the person requesting the 
service.

EIS bills services on a one month lag.  We take a snapshot of the Corporate 
Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha 
phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the HR company and department 
for each employee.  This snapshot is taken at the end of each month for use 
as a source for billing information.  

Please examine these billings for accuracy.  If our billings are incorrect, 
generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting 
Corporate Administrative Services or the person should be moved to the 
correct HR department by contacting your HR representative.  If the room 
number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, this may be 
corrected by sending the room number along with the telephone number to Notes 
Mail ID "Move-Team".

FYI,   There is a rumor on Yahoo that Enron has bid for Carin Energy.  I have 
talked with Jackie Gentle in our London Office who first heard the rumor and 
we have confirmed that neither EGEP or the London office is pursuing such a 
deal.  My guess is that it is either EOGR ( I know they are pursuing an Int'l 
deal) or just a bad release.

Thanks to everyone for their work on the Senate hearing.  There are a couple 
of follow-up items:

Thanks to the Portland and Washington teams, Sen Wyden is very interested in 
identifying the kind of information we need from the ISO (and PX to the 
extent it's still relevant) to make the market work better.  We have written 
this up before, I think we just need to put it in letter form.  Alan -- 
please take the lead on this and get a draft to Linda.  I think we should 
identify the information and also prepare a letter for the Chairman (?) that 
could be sent to the FERC.
Murkowski (the Committee Chairman) asked for an itemized list of things the 
fed should do to expedite siting as well as anything else we feel is 
necessary  to address the California crisis.  We have identified the need for 
open access across the nation, but he is looking for what can be done in the 
2-4 month time frame.  Dave, I think your memo to me is a good start.  Sue -- 
could you please put those and any other suggestions in letter form and get 
them to Linda?
Finally, Sen Feinstein asked all of the witnesses to ask their CEOs not to 
"price gouge" -- yes, that's what she said.  She appealed to everyone's 
community spirit and asked suppliers to forbear charging high prices while 
California struggles to fix its problems.  I think we should send a response 
from Ken.  Jeff -- please take a cut and get to Linda.  I think the basic 
messages should be:  we are actively working on solutions with California 
policymakers (forward contracting was our idea after all); we are actively 
pursuing demand reduction in the state, etc.  We should also explain the 
nature of our business and pick up on some of the other solutions we 
identified in the written testimony, offer to meet to discuss further, etc.

I received a call today from Rep. John Culberson about a nascent campaign 
underway to nominate Ken Lay as NASA Administrator.  Rep. Culberson has 
broached this idea with Eugene Cernan, who liked the idea .   The Congressman 
asked that we check to see if Ken is interested, as he would like to 
orchestrate a campaign on Ken's behalf.  I promised the Congressman to check 
as to Ken's interest.  Steve, should I snuff this out?  Give him 
encouragement?  I need to call the Congressman back very soon.  Thanks.

I do support the change.  Let me know what I can do to help.  You are 
correct: this is the way we handle regulatory counsel in other regions, 
particularly the US.  What Derrick and I have agreed with regard to counsel 
selection is:  gov't/reg affairs picks the counsel we want to use and he 
retains a veto, which has rarely if ever been exercised.  Once we have 
retained counsel we will use that counsel on other regulatory projects unless 
the legal department starts to have a problem with the firm (eg because they 
represent someone against us in litigation).  Again, I don't recall this ever 
being an issue.  It seems to work:  outside counsel gets the message that we 
will look dimly on any firm that squares off against us and we select the 
most qualified counsel on our issues.

Subject: 2001 budget

You should be receiving today a copy of my draft budget proposed for Enron 
Europe for 2001.  I understand from Nick that they are doing their own budget 
for Enron Japan, which I will see only after the fact.

MOST IMPORTANTLY, you will see that I am budgetting to pay a substantial sum 
for legal fees.  I will be proposing to John Sherriff, Michael Brown (our new 
COO and former General Counsel, which will make my proposal doubly 
problematic), and to Mark Evans (current General Counsel) that I pay/manage 
our outside regulatory counsel.  We can discuss (rather than do a lengthy 
e-mail), but having this function managed by Legal (and Houston/Jim Derrick 
rejecting our choice of counsel in important cases), is increasingly a 
problem.  I believe this will mirror what you do in the USA, e.g., Dan 
Watkiss, and hope that I can count on your support for this change.  thansk

Thanks for the invite. I would suggest Jean Ryall - who heads our Texas 
government/regulatory affairs team.  She is certainly more familiar with the 
details (of which there will be many more after this legislative session and 
the conclusion of the pilot program).  She is also a very good speaker (and 
can probably relate a few war stories to spice things up).

Subject: Beta Gamma Sigma

Steve,

I am a member of Beta Gamma Sigma (BGS), the honor society for business 
programs accredited by AASCB - The International Association for Management 
Education.  If you are not familiar with BGS, a member must be in the upper 
5% of their class as a junior and the upper 10% as a senior and in graduate 
school to be nominated for induction into the society.

In an effort to provide additional programs and benefits to alumni members, 
alumni chapters are being developed around the country.  There are currently 
nine alumni chapters around the U.S. with a new one being formed in the 
Houston area.  I am serving on a steering committee for the development of 
this Houston Area Alumni Chapter.  Our primary reasons for starting a Houston 
Area Chapter include networking, professional affiliations, outreach to 
students, resources, learning opportunities, and providing scholarships.

Our initial outreach to Beta Gamma Sigma members will be through a 
reception/dinner to be held in October 2001.  We are currently looking at 
either October 16 or 18.  All 6,200 Houston area members will be invited to 
participate, however, we expect attendance to be closer to 75-100 people.  
The ages, experiences, and business affiliation of the members will be very 
diverse, but all will have the common thread of business excellence.

The details of this event are still being finalized; however, at our last 
meeting the discussion encompassed possible speakers and topics.  
Overwhelmingly the team decided on Electricity Deregulation in Texas, and 
since I work at Enron, I was asked to assist in locating a dynamic speaker.  
Cliff Baxter suggested that you would be an ideal speaker on this topic.  Are 
you available and willing to address this group in October?  

If I can provide any additional information, please let me know.

Thank you for your consideration, Steve.

See attached.  Looks fairly minor:  a 7500 dollar "contribution" to the US 
Treasury to settle up for our failure to seek license transfer authorization 
from the FCC for PGE's telecommunications licenses when we merged in 1997.

		 Subject: CA Emissions/Environmental Issues

Steve - We were hoping to provide a chart that plotted out the NOx emissions 
from existing fossil fuel generation vs, new cleaner generation.  This chart 
is not quite there.  However, it is a rough aggregate of the NOx generated by 
all of the existing fossil fuel generation over 50 MW in CA.  The data points 
were gathered from the EPA's Acid Rain CEMs (continuous emissions monitoring) 
database.  (I am working on a chart that's message is more clear.) As you 
will see, existing generation is significantly dirtier than what new, 
combined cycle plants would be.  In fact, of the utility units in CA 
reporting under Title IV, there are a number of steam plants with NOx 
emissions of 0.1 lb/MMBtu or in some cases more.  This corresponds to about 1 
lb NOx/MWh compared to 0.056 lb/MWh for a new gas combined cycle plant.  Even 
the cleaner boilers that are at 0.05 lb/MMBtu are 10 times higher than the 
new plants on an output basis.  

In otherwords, Dave Parquet is right that there is a lot of more polluting 
generation on line, while new plants have to meet ever tighter BACT 
requirements.



In the most recent version of SB 28 it looks like there are a lot of 
provisions focusing on the retrofitting of existing generation.  I suspect, 
the regulators are well aware of the discrepancies in emissions and would 
argue that the plants are going to have to clean up in the very near future.  
I am digging for more information on these timelines.

Gus, Marc, and I felt like the main short term fixes/solutions would be:

1.  Expanding the hours of operations for back-up generators.  (As I have 
previously stated, some of the local air districts have increased the 
permitted run hours for emergency generators from 200 to 500 at only 
"essential public services.")  

2.  CA requiring offsetting of emissions at only the ratios required by 
Federal regulations.  In many cases state requirements are more stringent.

3.  The EPA allowing the concept of the pollution mitigation bank - it is 
really going to be an issue of timing - once the CA government has the funds 
to start acquiring offsets they will be able to provide them prior to the 
operation of a new generation facility, However, there is going to be some 
initial lag time where the offsets aren't in the hands of the generation 
operators (which goes against the requirements of the Clean Air Act).

4.  The Feds working with the state and local permitters to create alternate 
sources of emission offsets.  There simply aren't enough in all the air 
districts.  As I stated, in my previous memo the USEPA has allowed, under the 
NOx SIP call, emissions allowances to be given to renewable and energy 
efficiency projects. CA is going to need guidance from the USEPA in how to 
create and count alternate sources of offsets in nonattainment areas.

5.  The USEPA better defining the nonattainment air sheds and pollution 
transportation pathways.  Apparently, there is not a central model of the air 
patterns in CA.  Thus, the 35 local air districts all having different 
requirements about inter-district offsets.

However, the real issues as Dave alluded to in his memo are going to require 
modifications to the Clean Air Act.  It is pretty prescriptive about what can 
and can't be done, and there is not a whole lot of flexibility.  

Let me know if anything in here is not clear.  I'm working on refining the 
data and presentation of the data.

		 Subject: EGEP/EOGIL Customs Duty Inquiry on Offshore Production

We were served summons by the Customs Office in Surat asking for meetings 
with our platform managers and on Dec.12th we sent two representatives 
(operations mgr & legal) to answer their questions.  Over a two day period 
they inquired about production and logistical issues and asked a number of 
questions regarding product delivery points, pricing formulas, etc.   In 
summary, they are trying to build a case that the gas and maybe even the 
crude we sell in India is subject to a 10-12% customs duty since it is 
produced outside of the 12 mile territorial limit.  They are trying to make 
the case that we are importing the gas and oil into India.  Obviously this is 
not the case and there is no merit for such consideration, but we don't want 
to let this idea get entered as a show/cause filing against Enron and our 
partners.  There would be remedies such as court or arbitration, but the 
timing to resolve this is probably 1-2 years.  Furthermore, this issue would 
most likely impact current efforts we have on-going.  Therefore, we are 
taking the issue very seriously and plan to meet in Mumbai next Thursday to 
chart an appropriate course of action.  Once we meet, we will get back to 
Cliff and Jim Derrick regarding our recommendation on Thursday morning 
December 21st Houston time.  Cliff and Jim, if you are planning to be out of 
the office, please drop me an e-mail where you can be reached.

Meeting in Mumbai next Thursday will be Chris Walker of Linklaters, local 
Indian counsel (Saberwal ?), myself, Mike Stewart, Dominic Carolan (EGEP 
legal), and certain representatives from EOGIL.  We would also like to have 
Jane Wilson(EIPL Gov't & Regulatory affairs for India) present if she is 
available.  Jane it is not mandatory that you are present, but if you can't 
attend could you send me an e-mail where I could reach you if necessary.  The 
meeting will be at EOGIL's office and Fatima Samuel will confirm the time and 
place once Chris Walker's schedule is known.  It is my understanding that 
Chris Walker will be in India on Tuesday and Wednesday working with Wade's 
group on other matters. 

This issue came up originally in 1997 right after we started producing gas at 
Tapti.  At that time we had 3 legal opinions prepared and the legal team 
tells me the positions were very strong in our favor on a variety of fronts.  
After a few meetings and a couple of letters the issue went away and never 
resurfaced again until now.  We suspect that this issue has been an open item 
since that time and for a variety of reasons (ongoing activities ?) someone 
feels it needs to be checked off the list.  Hence, the revived interest at 
this time.  

The reason we are giving this such a high level of attention is probably 
obvious, but the reason we want to act upon our plan immediately once we get 
together next Thursday may seem less necessary.  However, today our office 
received 3 more summons for 3 different people to report to Surat next 
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.  This time they have asked for our 
production manager, logistics manager and lead accountant.  We have requested 
an extension due to the short notice and holiday season and expect to have it 
granted, but we will not know if it is postponed before Monday.   (If we have 
to go we will have legal counsel attend with the individuals named)  This 
level of back to back activity for a government office at this time year is a 
concern.  Going into the meeting with the legal guys on Thursday, we are 
thinking that we need to have a highly respected person(such as Saberwal) 
deliver  our message (to multiple groups, i.e., Surat customs, Ministry of 
Finance, Mopng) as to the lack of validity for this potential claim and what 
we would do if they proceed.   By Thursday I think we will have all of the 
necessary "color" on this issue and with the team mentioned above we will be 
able to develop the right plan of action.  However, due to the level of 
interest and activity of the Surat Customs group, we anticipate that our 
recommendation will be to move quickly, hence, my desire to contact Cliff and 
Jim next Thursday for approval to proceed.  

I have included Wade and Rebecca(EIPL) as well as Steve and John(PR) for 
information purposes at this time.    
This first stage plan we will be seeking approval for next Thursday will be 
to meet with certain people in an attempt to keep this from becoming an 
issue.  This should be a fairly quiet issue (for Indian standards) next week 
and even the subsequent meetings that I'm anticipating would take place in 
the following two weeks ought to be very low keyed items.  However, in India 
you never know and considering some of the existing press of recent we should 
get prepared and make sure we are co-ordinated.   John, following our 
Thursday decision we should probably talk about our plan so if you'll leave 
me a note where you can be reached, I'd appreciate it.  

In summary, the odds are we will be able to manage this and it won't become a 
big issue.  However, we need to take this very seriously and deal with it 
proactively and quickly before someone files something without understanding 
the consequences of the action.  I am leaving for India on Sunday and when 
possible I will pick up my mail.  I will also be checking voicemail if you 
need to leave a message.   I will be the Mumbai office on Tuesday, Thursday 
and Friday and in Delhi on Wednesday.

It looks like we are playing a smaller role than the WSJ article indicates -- 
i.e. a role commensurate with our level of interest.  I have talked with John 
several times about the relative importance of OPIC, ExIm and other funding 
organizations in light of the change in emphasis in our business.  As a 
result of those discussions we cut headcount and expenditures from the 
proposed budget for "01 and John has joined Linda Robertson's organization in 
the DC office (instead of being a stand alone effort).  Having said that, my 
view (based on the work John has been doing) is that we continue to have a 
considerable amount of work for him to do on the project finance front as a 
result of existing projects, projects we continue to pursue, and transfer 
issues associated with the asset sales.  Do you agree?

 This is not a battle to fight with OMB, but we have to show the agencies 
that we are supportive of  their programs and their budgets.  We are not 
going to lead the battle and in fact have not particpated in meetings on the 
hill.  But we are in negotiations with both EXIM and OPIC on Electrobolt and 
will need their support on our problem projects.  Also, Rebecca McDonald is 
on EXIM's private sector advisory committee.  If you need more lets talk.  
Thanks John

Exporters Rush to Ex-Im Bank's Defense --- Lobby Campaign to Prevent Budget 
Cuts Seeks Help Of 100,000 Small Firms

WASHINGTON -- Angry and confused that a Republican administration has 
targeted one of their favorite programs for big cuts, America's largest 
exporters are appealing for help from lawmakers. 
Boeing Co., Caterpillar Inc., Enron Corp., Halliburton Co. and others are 
launching an aggressive lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill to protect the 
Export-Import Bank from budget reductions; the White House labels the Ex-Im 
Bank as corporate welfare.
"The administration has fired its shot, and now we're firing ours," said 
Edmund B. Rice, president of the Coalition for Employment Through Exports, an 
industry group that is leading the effort. 
Since they got wind of the proposed cuts a few weeks ago, business lobbyists 
have been trying to rally sympathetic lawmakers. And executives at Boeing, 
Caterpillar and other big companies plan to contact some 100,000 smaller 
suppliers that benefit indirectly from the $12.6 billion of export loans, 
guarantees and insurance that Ex-Im Bank provided in the last fiscal year. 
Those small companies, the executives hope, will create a groundswell of 
support in Congress for the Ex-Im Bank. 
"Companies large and small who have similar interests here are banding 
together to provide an educational effort so people understand the impact of 
this," said Chris Hansen, Boeing senior vice president for government 
relations. 
Corporate lobbyists also have dug up a speech that Vice President Dick 
Cheney, while chief executive of Halliburton, gave in 1997 praising the bank 
and scoffing at those who consider it a giveaway to big business. They plan 
to pass Mr. Cheney's comments to influential members of Congress this week. 
"We'll be circulating them very broadly," Mr. Rice said. 
A spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney had no immediate comment. 
Ex-Im Bank officials aren't talking publicly, avoiding the appearance that 
they are battling the White House to overturn the proposed 25% cut in the 
bank's $865 million operating budget for the current fiscal year, which ends 
Sept. 30. But an Ex-Im official said the topic has come up in conversations 
between key lawmakers and Ex-Im Bank Chairman James A. Harmon, who is soon to 
be succeeded by Mel Sembler, a Bush campaign fund-raiser and a 
shopping-center developer. 
At first, business lobbyists assumed administration budgeteers were just 
looking for savings anywhere they could find it. Before President Bush 
released his spending plan last week, companies appealed to Mitchell Daniels, 
head of the White House budget office, in an attempt to keep the Ex-Im Bank 
cuts out of the final proposal. 
The Ex-Im Bank's corporate clients include some of the country's largest 
political contributors. Boeing, the bank's largest user, received $3.3 
billion of financing last year. The Seattle aerospace company and its 
employees contributed $1.8 million to politicians and parties during the 2000 
election cycle, 61% to Republicans, according to federal election data 
assembled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Caterpillar, a Peoria, Ill., 
maker of engines and heavy equipment that secured seven Ex-Im Bank deals last 
year, and its employees contributed more than $500,000 -- 96% to Republicans. 
Company officials deny they wanted to leverage donations to try to secure 
political support for the Ex-Im Bank. 
Many lobbyists have come to the conclusion that administration officials -- 
those of a libertarian persuasion -- oppose Ex-Im Bank as a form of welfare 
for corporations. Indeed, the White House budget plan criticized the bank's 
operations as unjustified public subsidies for companies. "That makes it a 
much more serious issue," Mr. Rice said. "We're concerned that the 
administration seems to be turning its attention in this direction." 
Barring intervention from Mr. Cheney, business groups now have largely given 
up hope of convincing the White House to back down, planning instead to use 
their muscle to convince Congress to restore the Ex-Im Bank's funding. Bank 
officials and U.S. companies argue that, far from being a subsidy, the bank 
simply allows American companies to compete with European and Japanese firms 
that receive assistance from their own governments. 
"In many markets in Asia and Africa, the bank is absolutely critical to our 
ability to sell American-made products," said Bill Lane, Caterpillar's 
Washington director for governmental affairs.

[What's Brewing in the Real Estate Market] 
No Problem, Houston 
CENTURY DEVELOPMENT is about to announce plans to break ground on downtown 
Houston's third major office development in less than three years. In another 
sign of the strength of the city's energy sector, Century is finalizing a 
headquarters deal with Reliant Resources Inc. to take more than two-thirds of 
the project's 850,000 square feet, says Edwin Murphy, a Century senior vice 
president. 
Two other towers also are underway. In 1999, Hines began building a 1.2 
million square-foot tower for Enron Corp. and late last year Crescent Real 
Estate Equities broke ground on a 27-story tower that will be anchored by 
Ernst & Young. These three projects are the first major downtown office 
projects to get underway since 1986. 
The surge is part of a renaissance of downtown Houston, where new sports 
facilities, hotels, apartment buildings and restaurants have been mushrooming 
in recent years. "The new amenities have kept people from leaving and enticed 
people to come back," says Michael Hassler, of CB Richard Ellis.

Dutch Gas Competition Grows Despite Sluggish Reforms
By Germana Canzi
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

03/07/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- The Netherlands is emerging as an important testing 
ground for E.U. gas liberalization, as new trading hubs for competitive, 
short-term gas supplies from the U.K. and Norway emerge on the Belgian and 
German borders. 
However, much remains to be done. A group of large energy users and traders 
is preparing to confront Gasunie Thursday in a hearing organized by the 
regulator. The main issues of contention are the balancing system, which 
Gasunie conducts on an hourly basis, the extent to which transport tariffs 
are cost-focused and third-party access to storage facilities.
The emergence of competition in the Dutch gas sector is mostly due to the 
initiative of new market entrants who, despite a difficult regulatory 
environment, have managed to develop a market for short-term gas virtually 
from scratch. 
If liquidity improves in these emerging hubs, the Netherlands could become an 
important transit country for freely tradeable gas supplies to other 
countries in northwest Europe, as well as being an important market in its 
own right. However, the difficulty of implementing transparent third-party 
access systems in the Netherlands and in neighboring Germany casts a dark 
cloud over recent progress in competition. 
Since December, Enron Europe Ltd. (U.ENE), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), E.On AG 
(EON), RWE AG (G.RWE) and Electrabel SA (B.ELE) have been actively buying and 
selling gas, sourced in the U.K., the Netherlands and Norway, in a number of 
hubs between Emden in Germany and Emshaven and Oude Statenzijl in the 
Netherlands. 
David Gallagher, head of European gas trading at Enron in London, estimates 
that at least one trade a day of around 100,000 therms for a quarterly 
contract is done at the Oude Statenzijl hub, where the Gasunie pipeline 
system connects to the network of Wingas GmbH. 
An important element kick-starting short-term trading was the sale, in 
December 2000, of a 2 billion cubic meter a year Norwegian gas supply 
contract to five Dutch-based power generators. 
Robert van der Hoeven, head of fuel procurement at Electrabel, the owner of 
Dutch generator EPON, said his company uses most of the gas it imports from 
Norway for its plants in the Netherlands and trades the rest on a short-term 
basis in the Oude-Emden area. This pattern is common to the other Dutch-based 
parties to that contract. 
Trading in Dutch hubs received a further boost when Nederlandse Gasunie NV 
(N.NEG) decided, after months of wrangling with regulator DTe, to lower its 
transport tariffs by 6.5% from January 2001 and to unbundle its combined 
commodity and service tariff, the so-called CSS system, from July 2001. 
Gasunie now claims its pipeline system is fully open and transparent. To 
prove this, it says it has lost 30% of its customers in the eligible market, 
but that figure hasn't changed much since March 2000. Small wonder that 
critics say the switching figure doesn't necessarily indicate an ideal system 
of third-party access. 
According to energy consultants The Brattle Group, around half of the gas 
used by alternative suppliers goes through the 1 bcm/year Zebra pipeline from 
Zelzate to Zeeland, which was built by Dutch utilities a few years ago 
precisely because Gasunie refused to provide access on favorable terms. 
Shippers have complained that the hourly system used by Gasunie to balance 
the pipeline system raises the overall cost of shipping through its network 
significantly. Gasunie imposes a balancing charge which effectively forces 
shippers to pay for the extra gas brought into the system from storage sites, 
in addition to the capacity and transmission price. Critics say Gasunie has 
so far failed to unbundle these charges, although it agreed to do so in 
January. 
According to the Brattle Group, another controversial aspect of Gasunie's 
tariff system is that it is based on theoretical costs of constructing new 
pipelines rather than its actual costs. 
The DTe is also considering ways of reforming the storage system to make it 
competitive. BP PLC (U.BP) and Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij NV operate 
storage facilities and lease capacity to Gasunie through long-term contracts. 
The regulator is studying ways of allowing third parties access to storage 
facilities. Gasunie has so far shown little sign of negotiating more 
competitive tariffs with storage operators and passing on the benefits to 
customers, critics say. 
The growth of short-term trading in the Dutch gas market is also inevitably 
linked to its potential as a transit country for gas coming from the 
U.K.-Belgium gas interconnector and going towards the 82bcm-a-year German 
market. 
Market participants say liquidity at the Emden and Oude hubs has grown 
considerably since E.On and RWE started trading there earlier this year. 
However, the obstructive attitude of incumbents toward third-party access 
there has meant that so far most gas traded in the Netherlands has remained 
there.

WASHINGTON -- Angry and confused that a Republican administration has

Deal with state could take until 2002 to close
By LESLIE GORNSTEIN
AP Business Writer

03/06/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

LOS ANGELES (AP) - A tentative deal aimed at rescuing Southern California 
Edison from insolvency might not close in time to prevent the utility from 
begging creditors for more patience, Edison officials said Tuesday. 
The utility's tentative, $2.7 billion agreement to sell its power lines to 
the state could take until 2002 to be consummated, thanks to complicated 
legal issues and other paperwork, an Edison official told bondholders Tuesday.
Once the deal is signed, Edison will try to borrow against the promised cash, 
but Edison International Chief Financial Officer Ted Craver admitted the 
utility might have to ask creditors to simply wait for their money until it 
has the $2.7 billion in hand. 
Energy suppliers owed money by Edison did not immediately return calls for 
comment Tuesday. 
At least four groups of suppliers have sued Edison for millions in unpaid 
bills going back months. Edison and fellow utility Pacific Gas & Electric 
have said they have lost $13 billion on the open power market thanks to 
soaring prices paired with state-imposed price caps. 
PG&E's parent company was able to recently borrow $1 billion to pay its 
stockholders and its debuts. It did not use any of that money to pay PG&E's 
bills. 
Edison's disclosure, meanwhile, shocked state officials. 
Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, initially declined to comment 
on the status of the Edison deal, but eventually said, regarding its closure, 
"We're optimistic it will be sooner rather than later." 
The pacing would have nothing to do with whether fellow utilities Sempra 
Energy and PG&E also sell their transmission lines to California, Craver 
said. 
Among the things that could delay the deal's closing is Edison's need to find 
landowners on whose property its lines were built to assure no legal 
agreements are being violated by the sale. Edison would also have to pin down 
exactly what it would be selling to the state - terms that might not be 
decided until after a deal has been inked, Craver said. 
"Trust me," Craver said in a phone call after the conference. "There are a 
lot of legal-type documents - stuff that you and I ... would think of as a 
bloody nightmare." 
The disclosure comes at a time when an increasing number of power suppliers 
are suing the utility for millions in unpaid bills. 
Edison also disclosed Tuesday that two more lawsuits had landed in its lap - 
one by a group of wind-powered generators including Enron Wind, the other by 
two suppliers including New York-based Caithness Energy. 
Both suits were filed during the past five days, Edison Assistant General 
Counsel Barbara Reeves said. It was not immediately clear how much the 
complainants were seeking; neither Enron nor Caithness returned calls for 
comment. 
The two filings bring the total number of suits by renewable-energy suppliers 
against Edison to four, the utility said. The city of Long Beach and 
CalEnergy Operating Group, a geothermal supplier, have also sued for back 
payments. 
CalEnergy alone has said it is owed $45 million in November and December 
payments. 
The line sale, part of a multifaceted, tentative deal with the state that 
could save Edison from insolvency, could take anywhere from several months 
into next year, Craver said. 
The tentative deal, announced by Gov. Gray Davis Feb. 23, calls for the state 
to pay more than twice the book value for Edison's lines. 
It also would require Edison to sell cheap power to the state for a decade 
and for Edison to end its lawsuit against state regulators. The suit asserts 
that price caps imposed by the California Public Utilities Commission are 
illegal under federal law. 
Additionally, Edison's parent would have to return $420 million it collected 
from the utility over the past several years. The money was used to pay debt, 
buy back stock and pay dividends to investors. 
SCE, PG&E and Sempra have complained they are near bankruptcy because of 
soaring prices on the open market combined with the state-imposed price caps 
for consumers. 
Sempra and PG&E have yet to announce similar line-sale deals with the state, 
though they and the governor have said negotiations are ongoing. The total 
cost of the 26,000 miles of lines has been estimated at $4.5 billion to $7 
billion.

Sierra Pacific CEO Doubts SEC OK Of Enron Unit Buy-Report

03/06/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Sierra Pacific Resources (SRP) CEO Walter Higgins 
said in an interview last week that he doubts the company's $3.1 billion 
acquisition of Enron Corp.'s (ENE) utility Portland General Electric will be 
approved by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the Las Vegas Sun 
reported Tuesday. 
The SEC must find that Sierra Pacific is in a strong financial position 
before it will approve the deal, but the company is currently weakened by 
having lost millions of dollars in fuel and purchased power costs, Higgins 
said in the report.
A $311 million rate increase to cover those costs began March 1, but Higgins 
said that money would only pay back those expenses and wouldn't improve the 
company's stability to a level the SEC would find adequate, according to the 
report. 
The Public Utilities Commission can halt the rate hike and order refunds if 
it decides the hike isn't necessary. The PUC is holding hearings to determine 
the prudency of the hike, and members of the state's powerful casino and 
mining industries have filed to intervene. 
Sierra Pacific's plan to shore up its financial position through the sale of 
its 10 power plants, worth nearly $2 billion, may also be in jeopardy. The 
state Senate is considering a bill to block the sales, and Nevada Gov. Kenny 
Guinn recently sent a letter to the PUC asking that it reconsider its order 
allowing electric utilities to sell assets. 
Financial analysts have said that not allowing Sierra Pacific's two utilities 
to sell their assets would have a ripple effect on the company's financial 
position. The asset sales are tied to low-priced power contracts, and if the 
sales are canceled, the low-priced power will be gone as well. 
"If the divestiture is stopped...the state may be dealing with a much bigger 
rate increase," Steve Fleishman, Merrill Lynch utility analyst, told Dow 
Jones Newswires recently. 
Sierra Pacific is the parent company of electric utilities Sierra Pacific 
Power Co. and Nevada Power, which serve customers in the state's North and 
South, respectively.

Many Power Deals Announced by California Governor Still Not Final
By Jason Leopold

03/06/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Dow Jones Newswires 
LOS ANGELES -- Many of the long-term power-supply contracts announced by 
California Gov. Gray Davis this week remain under negotiation or are the 
subject of ongoing lawsuits, power suppliers said Tuesday.
The lack of finality to the deals raises questions about the state's success 
in covering its power needs, particularly going into what is expected to be 
an unusually tight summer. 
Generators said privately they were surprised the governor went ahead with 
his announcement Monday, given that many of the contracts haven't been 
signed. 
David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power, who negotiated the contracts on behalf of the state, conceded that 
details remain to be worked out. "This is not a done deal," Mr. Freeman said, 
adding that credit concerns are keeping generators from signing the deals. 
Gov. Davis announced Monday that California has secured 40 long-term 
contracts that will provide California with about 629 million megawatt hours 
of electricity over 10 years, at a price of more than $40 billion. A megawatt 
hour is roughly the amount of electricity needed to power 1,000 homes. 
Several of those forward deals, however, involve contracts originally held by 
Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp. 
(PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric at the California Power Exchange, 
previously the state's main power market. 
The governor seized those contracts earlier this year, just before the Power 
Exchange liquidated them to cover hundreds of millions of dollars in power 
bills the utilities had failed to pay. 
The contracts, which total about 1.3 million megawatt hours of electricity 
and have a market value of about $1 billion, according to market sources, 
have yet to be paid for or signed over to the state. Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), 
one of the suppliers that sold the contracts to Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed, has 
sued Gov. Davis for unlawfully commandeering those contracts. 
Although Duke has reached an interim settlement to continue providing power 
to the state Department of Water Resources until April 30, the company and 
the Davis administration still have to "develop a comprehensive long-term 
settlement to pay for the power supply contracts," said Duke spokesman Tom 
Williams. 
The governor went ahead with the announcement, because the California 
Department of Water Resources believes it will be able to finalize and sign 
the contracts over the next several weeks, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio 
said. 
Separately, several suppliers named in the governor's announcement Monday -- 
including Duke, Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Mirant Corp. (MIR), Sempra Energy, 
Enron Corp. (ENE) and Avista Corp. (AVA) -- said they have yet to sign final 
agreements with the state, although negotiations were ongoing. 
"We are working in good faith with the DWR toward a long-term contract," said 
Art Larson, spokesman for Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra. Mr. 
Larson said Sempra signed a terms of agreement with the water-resources 
department and expects to reach a final agreement over the next several 
weeks. 
Reliant said it has only signed a short-term contract with the state that 
expires in about two weeks. The company will only sign a long-term contract 
once it's paid more than $400 million owed by Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed, 
spokesman Richard Wheatley said. 
Mirant said it also won't sign contracts with the state until it's paid. 
Enron said it's reached agreement on terms with the state, but has some 
credit-related details to hammer out. "Everything's been agreed to except for 
some credit technicalities," Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. 
Meanwhile, small, independent power plants in California that are capable of 
generating 1,800 megawatts of power are shut down because their owners 
haven't been paid by the state's two main utilities, the California 
Independent System Operator said Tuesday. 
The decline in small-plant output has contributed to the state's power-supply 
problems the past two months. Partnerships involving El Paso Corp. (EPG), for 
example, shut down 350 megawatts of generation last weekend due to 
nonpayment, the company said Tuesday. 
SoCal Ed hasn't paid the owners of the smaller generators, known as 
"qualifying facilities," since early December, which means the generators are 
still owed for electric production in October, while PG&E has paid only a 
small percentage of its qualifying facility bills since its last full payment 
in early January. 
The plants, one-third of which are powered by renewable sources like wind and 
solar power, meet almost 30% of California's electricity needs. Almost all of 
the closed generators are fueled by natural gas, and many haven't been able 
to pay their gas suppliers and have been cut off from their gas supply. 
The California Senate Energy Committee plans to vote on legislation to create 
a new pricing system for all qualifying facilities this week. The proposed 
bill would cut the prices to qualifying facilities from about 17 cents a 
kilowatt-hour the past eight months to about eight cents, depending on the 
price of five-year natural-gas contracts the generators can sign. The plants 
that run on renewable resources would be paid 5.4 cents a kilowatt-hour.

US Natural Gas Prices Fall As Demand Slips In Most Areas

03/06/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. natural gas physical prices fell Tuesday as demand 
eased, except in the Northeast and Southeast areas of the country, traders 
said. 
Heavy snowstorms in the upper Northeast supported some pricing, as did cooler 
weather in Georgia, the Carolinas and the Florida panhandle.
Some storage buying occurred in Texas "if they could make it work," a trader 
said. 
"It was a pretty uneventful day," a Gulf Coast trader said late Tuesday. 
Also, because of the snowstorm in the Northeast, traders had purchased gas 
ahead of time to make up for needed load, he said. 
A scheduled work outage on Enron's Transwestern San Juan lateral in New 
Mexico was completed, and the return of a power plant in California 
alleviated demand in the West, traders said. 
At the Arizona-California border hub, buyers paid around $13-$33 a million 
British thermal units, West Coast traders said, down as much as $15 from 
Monday. 
At PG&E Citygate, prices were mixed, with buyers paying $9.75-$10.65/MMBtu, 
down 25 cents on the bid, up 15 cents on the offer. 
In the Midwest, Chicago Citygate prices fell 7 cents-8 cents to a range of 
$5.42-$5.53/MMBtu. Alliance Pipeline into Chicago traded around 
$5.47-$5.52/MMBtu, down 4 cents to 9 cents from Monday. 
The Nymex April natural gas futures contract settled at $5.315/MMBtu, down 
2.1 cents in a tight, range-bound, uneventful session that started late due 
to bad weather. 
Physical gas prices at the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana ended in a 
range of $5.25-$5.30/MMBtu, down 2 cents-6 cents from Monday. 
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line at Station 65 deals were made in a similar 
range of $5.26-$5.35/MMBtu, down 2 cents on the bid, unchanged on the offer. 
At Katy in East Texas, buyers paid $5.21-$5.30/MMBtu, down 5 cents-6 cents. 
At Waha, prices fell 9 cents-12 cents to a range of $5.15-$5.30/MMBtu.

Subject: Iraqui - Oil for food

Mark:

I am looking at a proposal, under which a Russian oil-major would be wishing 
to sell Iraqui crude to us, coming from the UN oil-for-food program. I would 
be interested to learn, whether Enron can purchase crude oil from this 
program (provided that we receive proof that it comes out of the UN program) 
and whether we are willing to do it (corporate policy).

I want to check that out first, before going forward. Next step would be to 
receive a good level of confidence that the offer is genuine, and then I 
would talk to the liquids traders.

Best regards,
Wolfgang

Steve, it was great to meet you and hear your remarks yesterday.  For the 
speaking engagement next Wednesday, I would like you to focus upon the Enron 
strategic model of virtual integration of market forces in the evolution of 
energy development.  Wyoming represents a huge material resource base and the 
commission is charged with the development and promotion of such.  But the 
Governor's message is that we cannot see ourselves as producers and exporters 
in the traditional sense.  We will continue to have the status of a colony if 
we do not recognize the new dynamics of how these market places are 
evolving.  If you set the stage with a presentation of Enron strategy, then 
we will discuss how a state, with its agencies and auathority can play a role 
in this evolution.  I have set your time for 45 minutes, which can include a 
short Qand A period.  But your message can be as succint as you can make it 
and get the point across.  You may have to present the Enron case a number of 
different ways, but the Governor will give you latitude to make the point.   
You will be welcome to participate in a following panel which will address 
role playing by the state and the commission.  Plan to join us for lunch.  If 
you need more detail, let me know.  Thanks!  Stephen

Joe - there is no announcement today.  I tried to leave you a voicemail but 
apparently the system is down there.

Before we can offer an outside person a VP position, the Executive Committee 
must sign off.  We are going to be going through that process in a few 
minutes.  Then we begin the offer extension and negotiations.  The person we 
are recommending is Linda Robertson, one of the two people I mentioned to you 
before.

Please guard the information carefully.  Last time we talked, when the list 
had been narrowed to two, DeLay's office called with the exact two names and 
started pushing us to hire a Republican.  As you know we interviewed 
candidates of both political affiliations and just settled on the best 
person.  Ken told DeLay's office that's how we do things and Ken is 
comfortable (actually enthused) about the choice.

When some external announcement is done, you will be involved and your 
considerable contributions will be prominently mentioned.

We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA.  In attendance were Ken Lay, 
the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. 
spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his 
ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next 
week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  
Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on 
my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff 
Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our 
proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation 
based on the governor's comments:

Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that 
we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing 
communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to 
go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what 
the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more 
work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He 
talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail 
level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the 
benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he 
would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power 
(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented 
solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix 
the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.
Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also 
included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed 
interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a 
goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities 
to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate 
analysts and other "nonadvocates" to develop solutions to a number of issues 
including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  
He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas 
purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding 
some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.
His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously 
under serious consideration and some of which were mere "brainstorming".  
Some of these ideas would require legislative action.
State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of 
generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that 
they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This 
was a frequently recurring theme.
Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus 
basis to consumers.
Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in 
California.
State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more 
widely deploy distributed generation.
Expand in-state gas production.
Take state lands gas royalties in kind.
negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for 
addtional gas supplies.
Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant 
maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at 
any one time.
Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.
Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear 
more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be 
able to help out here).
Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made 
some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy 
some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation 
thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control 
approach with generators.
Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.
To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's 
thoughts and get them to Kari)
He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- 
not just the 5 one year strips.
He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.
He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the 
deal.
He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the 
forward contracting issues.
Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.

Thanks.  Yes, I did know about the conference.  Ken has a copy of the study 
and made reference to it several times during our visits to Sac. a couple of 
weeks ago.  It's nice to occasionally see some rational thinking in 
California.  
I look forward to catching up with you when I get back to town.

Hope you are keeping your head above water.  I wanted to let you know about
this request.  As you know, we did work for the Bay Area Council.  I don't
know if you will be joining Ken on this, but I did send you a copy of the
report a couple of weeks ago.  I did not send one to Ken, but will.  Let me
know if you need any additional copies.

Lenny, Tony and Paul,

We have been contacted by Janet Yamane of Marathon Communications inviting
the Bay Area Council to sponsor a meeting with Bay Area  CEOs and Kenneth
Lay, Chairman of Enron, who will be visiting California this week to
discuss
energy and on.  She offered 5/17 am but added that if that wasn't available
that another time could be scheduled further on.  Sunne wanted your opinion
on this request.

Fred Furlong, Federal Reserve Bank is not available 5/17 am.  So that date
really won't work.  Please advise.

Alana

Subject: CI at EBS

Steve, I have heard "through the grapevine" that Amy Oberg has relayed to you 
that EBS will not be doing competitive intelligence and that you were 
dismayed to hear this.  

Amy is correct in the fact that EBS is not likely to buy the software 
Strategy that provides a strategic, top-down focus on competitive 
intelligence.    However,  EBS is doing tactical competitive analysis and 
market research.  We are providing the business units with the information 
that they need to make intelligent decisions at the business unit level. 

Amy's view is that competitive intelligence (CI) belongs at the corporate 
level and that CI should drive the strategic direction of the company.   You 
and I both know this is not the way Enron operates.  

I hope this e:mail does not sound negative but I did want you to know that 
EBS is providing information and intelligence to its business units -- it is 
just not in the context  that  Amy thinks it should be in.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

The letter looks good.  A couple of comments for your consideration:

On page three we describe the change to the definition of Public Utility and 
then argue that we don't fit into it.  Would it be worth explaining why that 
makes sense?  Specifically, the New Jersey restructuring law, like most 
efforts of its kind in other markets, is designed to separate the competitive 
from monopoly elements of the power (and gas) businesses.  Economic 
regulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the 
business (eg distribution).  The competitive market can not be solely relied 
upon to "regulate" the behavior of monopoly asset owners, such as 
distribution utilities.  Therefore, regulators continue to be called upon to 
set pricing and other terms of service.  What those regulators decide matters 
a great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for 
lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign 
contributions to tacitly influence decision makers.  The same public policies 
simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive.  The 
generation and sales business has a competitive structure (i.e. relatively 
low barriers to entry, multiple competitors etc.).  These components of the 
power and gas business can be "regulated" by the market with respect to rates 
and terms of service.  They do not require economic regulation any more than 
grocery stores, department stores, appliance sellers or other "retailers" 
(who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions.  Competition 
and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices and terms of 
service.  Because regulators don't set the prices and terms of service for 
such sellers, there is no reason to be concerned about campaign 
contribuitions from such organizations.  Indeed, the legislation, and the 
legislative history, clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale.
As a former practicing lawyer, I certainly understand the value of pleading 
in the alternative.  But, I question how certain of our arguments woud be 
perceived by the public if they ever came to light (which these documents 
have a habit of doing).. .  I can just see the press seizing on Enron's claim 
of "ignorance or mistake" or the fact that we pled for the favorable exercise 
of "prosecutorial discretion".  I suggest that we add whatever we feel is 
necessary to the very solid looking intent argument, not make specific 
reference to "ignorance or mistake", and not plead for the favorable 
esxercise of PD.  If we feel we need to write about this last item, perhaps 
we could suggest that it would be a waste of the public's resources to pursue 
a claim under such circumstances.

I think the Qs and As look good. I wouldn't bring up the California situation 
(eliminate the second half of A25).

Attached is the information on talent moves within Enron.  The numbers are 
for Enron's domestic workforce only.  The bottom line is that the EBS and EES 
redeployment figures are not unusual for Enron:  We moved over 3000 employees 
last year (about 25% of our domestic workforce).  Most of these moves are 
attributable new business startups (eg EGM, ENW and EIM) and normal course of 
business transfers within the company.  The formal redeployment process makes 
up only a small fraction of the total moves in the company.

I'm not sure yet.  I think we are going to be sending two memos  -- one that 
I am working on and on that Andy is working on.  It looks to me like the 
message below fits better into Andy's memo.  I don't think they will be 
combined into one, but I'll know more tomorrow.

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Special Asset Group will also become part of Enron Principal Investments.  
The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work with all the 
business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage equity investments, 
which leverage Enron's unique and proprietary knowledge.   These investments 
may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, traditional private equity and 
distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director, overseeing all activities of 
Enron Principal Investments.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Dick Lydecker, 
and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form Enron Principal 
Investments.  This new business unit will report to an investment committee, 
consisting of Greg Whalley, Ken Rice and Dave Delainey. 

 Please join me in congratulating and supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Dick 
and the other members of this group in this effort.

Jeff Skilling

information about the following:

Video Teleconference
Audio and Video quality; Viewing employees

IP-TV
Statistics; Successes of the locations streamed

Video Requests
Quantity by location and group


To improve access and increase the employee's viewing experience at future 
meetings,  we are working with the IP-TV technical team to find solutions to 
the problems that occurred in February.  From the employee feedback we 
received, we will plan to send slides in advance to the video teleconference 
locations.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this report.

Steve,

As you might have expected, Elsa already had a to do list, a budget, 
information on schools, etc.  I really did not have to discuss about moving 
to Houston.  The conversation was more around when and how.

On Friday I have to be in Houston for an EBS meeting on Mexico.  I am 
planning to arrive there on Thursday morning to talk to Rick, to Dan Reck and 
to Shawn Cumberland.  I also need to find out about relocation and visas , 
etc.

I am writing you to thank you for your generosity in your advice and for 
helping me and encouraging me in making this important decision.  I am also 
wirting because I am taking your word on Melissa's  knowledge of the real 
estate market inside the loop.  Elsa is coming with me on Thursday morning 
and we would like to see if it is possible for us to meet with Melissa on 
Thursday, Friday or Saturday for advice and orientation. (Of course you would 
be welcome to the real estate working session!!)

Please let me know.

Thanks again,

Ricardo

		 Subject: Re: Update - Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes

Thanks for your comments Steve.  

The legal arguments are one piece of our 5 point action plan (it relates to 
action items 2,3, and 4) that I outlined in my November 13 e-mail to the 
group.  Action item #1 (and I agree this must be our primary focus) is to 
communicate to the Alberta Government: i) Enron's views on what mistakes are 
being made by governments in other jurisdictions in response to high price 
levels,  and ii) Enron's plans for Alberta if the Alberta Government "stays 
the course" and does not interfere in the market.   We are hopeful this can 
be done through Milnthorp and Delainey meeting with Premier Klein and/or 
Minister Cardinal.  If such a meeting isn't possible we will simply have to 
get the message through to them via lower level officials in the Alberta 
Government. 

On Tuesday Rob Milnthorp left messages for Premier Klein, the Premier's Chief 
of Staff, and Minister Cardinal, and the Cardinal's Deputy Minister, Ken 
Smith.  I also spoke to Larry Charach of the ADRD.    The speaking points 
that we prepared to guide us through these calls are as follows:

Enron understands that electricity prices in Alberta are an important issue 
for the Government

Enron has concerns with a number of recent rule and market design 
developments in the electricity market 

Enron feel that it would be helpful for the President and CEO of Enron North 
America and Rob M to sit down for a brief meeting with the Premier and 
Minister Cardinal to:
 
1)  Explain Enron's current plans to expand commercial operations in both the 
electricity and natural gas sectors;

2) Express Enron's concerns that the Alberta electricity market "may not 
indeed be open for business" given recent developments, including:   

(i) The MAP and its adverse effect on the PPA Buyers and the "no harm" 
commitment;

(ii) Power Pool rule changes of the sort recently proposed will irreparably 
damage existing suppliers such as Enron, the ultimate effect of which will 
undoubtedly be the lack of development of much needed new supply and longer 
term high prices for consumers.  

3) Express Enron's willingness to draw on our experience in other markets and 
explain our vision of how the Government can work through this difficult 
period in the shortest possible time frame.

Ken Smith returned Milnthorp's call this morning and Rob Milnthorp advised 
that he covered each of the above speaking points and the conversation went 
very well.  Smith asked him "what would you do if you were us?" and Rob 
replied that the Government must stay the course as the alternatives will 
make the situation worse.  Rob also told Smith that Enron's preference is to 
continue to work with the Government on these difficult issues and Enron 
"doesn't like sending letters that threaten legal action to the Government or 
the Power Pool", especially since we share a common vision on electricity 
restructuring with the Alberta Government.  Smith indicated that with the 
Alberta Legislature back in session it would be difficult to get a meeting 
for us with the Premier but he would try to do so and would get back to 
Milnthorp.  

Whether we get a meeting with the Premier, or not, we still need to prepare a 
new briefing note for the government within the next week and at the very 
least Rob Milnthorp and I can meet with Larry Charach and Ken Smith to walk 
them through this document.  As you say, our document must focus on "the 
adverse effect on consumers" and the implications of the Government moving 
off the strategy it continues to publicly support (the Premier said again 
this week in question period that the problem is that we are short supply) 
which is to "allow the market to work".   

Regards,

Rob

congratulations!

One thing to add to the arguments:  we have to make the adverse effect on 
consumers the centerpiece of our arguments.  We need the legal arguments too, 
but this is fundamentally a political and consumer protection driven 
discussion.  We have to be prepared to demonstrate that the key to Alberta 
reducing prices is allowing new generation to enter and to do that you have 
to allow a true market price to be posted.  California has seen the 
cancellation of numerous projects while they remain desparate for new supply 
because they have tried to artificially constrain prices.  That's not good 
for consumers.  If they need a lower cost solution for consumers (or 
protection from price volatility in the meantime) they need to "outsource" 
the residential supply business in blocks for fixed price bids.

Regardless of how we frame the arguments, or the solutions, however, we have 
to make the public policy/ consumer protection arguments the center of our 
written and oral presentations.

Do you agree?

		 Subject: Update - Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes

Dale McMaster called this afternoon to advise that the Power Pool Council 
agreed to delay any decision on the recently proposed rule changes (importers 
excluded from setting pool price and dispatch risk) for a period of two 
weeks.  During this two week period Dale has been asked to obtain stakeholder 
input into ways to address concerns about whether the spot price in the 
Alberta Power Pool is a product of interaction among competitiors in a 
efficient market.   

In our discussions with the Power Pool and ADRD today and yesterday Enron 
expressed its willingness to work with the Power Pool to provide feedback on 
suggested rule changes but has also made it clear that we do not agree with 
the premise that there is a "problem" that requires "emergency" amendments to 
the Pool rules.  Our position has been that Alberta is short supply, and 
significant changes to the rules and/or market design will only discourage 
new generation development. 

Dale McMaster had just left the Power Pool Council meeting when he called and 
had not yet put much thought into how to define the issue he has to address 
and what the process will be.   We discussed the process and it appears he 
will likely receive comments from stakeholders at large and also assemble a 
small committee of 4-5 stakeholders (which would include Enron) to work with 
the Power Pool to consider possible changes to the Pool rules.  Dale said he 
would try to pull together a "terms of reference" document that would define 
the mandate of the small committee by tomorrow.

After my call with Dale McMaster, Peter Keohane and I spoke to Aleck Trawick 
and we have asked Blakes to assist us in three areas:

1) Once the terms of reference of this small committee are released (and 
assuming Enron is asked to participate on the committee) Blakes will assist 
us with preparing a letter that states that Enron's participation does not 
represent acknowledgement or agreement that the Power Pool Rules must be 
amended to address the concerns of some stakeholders about real time pricing 
in Alberta and that Enron's participation on the committee is on a without 
prejudice basis;

2) Enron needs to obtain the final memo from Frontier Economics in which 
Frontier provides its opinion on how the proposed rule changes: i) would 
introduce price discrimination into the Alberta electricity market, ii) would 
be contrary to the development of an efficient, fair and openly competitive 
market for electricity, iii) would compromise the independence of the Power 
Pool, and iv) would have the expected effect of artificially depressing the 
real time price of electricity in Alberta.  Once Blakes receives a copy of 
the Frontier Economics memo, they will prepare a memo for Enron advising: i) 
whether the two week process of consultation by the Power Pool is in 
accordance with the standards required of the PPC as an administrative 
tribunal operating in Alberta; and ii) whether such rule changes offend the 
provisions of the EUA;

3) Blakes will advise Enron of the possible avenues of recourse (i.e. appeal 
to the AEUB, and/or legal action in the Court of Queen's Bench) in the event 
the proposed rule changes (or similar changes) are approved by the PPC at the 
end of this two week period.   GPC and Eric Thode will also be consulted on 
this issue and obviously input from all those within Enron working on this 
project will be sought prior to any decision being made to pursue any 
possible legal remedies.  

Please advise if you have any comments.

Regards,

Rob

David:

Nice job!  Can you imagine the "fun" someone is going to have if a Region,
say SPP, MAIN, MAPP, WSCC, or FRCC, has a major blackout this summer and the
"loyal opposition" "discovers" that said region has refused to sign an
agreement such as this and not implemented the program required by the
agreement.  That may even constitute "willful neglect."  Wouldn't it be even
worst if the "discovery" showed that the region was not signed because the
region wanted to use it's position as a bargaining ploy? (SPP, FRCC, and
WSCC) Oh no, I sound like a wantabe lawyer!

Subject: Compliance Agreement


Regional Managers
Compliance Task Force

As we discussed on the conference call on Friday, I have prepared a simple
draft letter of intent for the use of those regions who wish to indicate
support for the regional compliance and enforcement program, but are not
yet in a position to sign the Agreement for Regional Compliance and
Enforcement Programs that the NERC Board of Trustees approved on February
13.

For the benefit of those who were not on the call, I'd like to recap where
things stand at this point.  My apologies if I mischaracterize anyone's
position.  NPCC and ERCOT have signed the agreement.  ECAR has stated it
will sign the agreement at the signing ceremony on March 30.  SPP is
prepared to sign the agreement, but doesn't want to be the only one it its
part of the Eastern Interconnection to do so.  FRCC was not on the call,
but has previously stated that it is prepared to sign so long as at least
six regions sign.  MAPP and MAIN have indicated that they prefer to develop
their program with their own members before they sign the NERC
agreement.  WSCC may need to consider the matter at its Board meeting in
early April.  SERC has the matter under consideration.  I have not heard
from MAAC, but it has a meeting scheduling for March 29.

I want to share with you my concern for the climate in Washington.  In the
past few weeks I have had occasion to speak with a number of people on
Capitol Hill and in the new Administration.  All are very concerned about
what might happen this summer.  If a serious incident occurs, I am quite
sure that Congress will legislate very quickly--whether it will legislate
wisely is a different question.  We have the opportunity with this
agreement for the industry to take charge of its own destiny.  If Congress
acts it may well assign a very central role to the Federal government to
take direct responsibility for reliability.  There are those in the
Department of Energy who are pushing for such a role.   Congressman Barton
is talking of the possibility of emergency legislation, possibly within the
next few weeks.  If the industry pulls together, I believe we can forestall
direct governmental controls, just as in 1965.  If the industry does not
step up, then Congress may well assign the responsibility elsewhere.

The CTG recommended to the Board that a critical mass of six Regions sign
onto the agreement before it goes forward.  For those Regions that are
considering developing their own programs with their members before they
sign the agreement, with the view of having the CAPG determine in advance
whether their programs meets the requirements of the agreement, I ask you
to consider this:  If we don't get a critical mass of Regions to sign, then
the CAPG may not come into existence.

The NERC/Regions agreement is really an undertaking by the regions to work
to develop their own regional compliance and enforcement program with their
members.  My request remains that each of the regions sign the agreement by
the March 30 Board meeting.  That will assure that we are able to make the
governance changes that we have all been working for.  If any region is
unable to sign by March 30, then use of the letter of intent would be a way
to demonstrate support for the program.  That may be enough to satisfy
those who have stated that moving forward on the compliance program is a
condition to their support of the governance changes.

Thanks very much for your consideration of the program and all the work
you've put into this transition so far.  Please let me know if you have
questions or if there is anything that we can do from here to be of
assistance to you.

Dan Douglass summarized this.  This really puts CA and the ISO on notice that 
they cannot confiscate the power as they seem ready to do -- FERC reiterates 
that the generators can sell power wherever they want because the cap is a 
cap on ISO purchases.  ANd if the ISO want to set a sale price cap it has to 
file with FERC, wait 60 days and amend its contract

Subject: FERC Order on Morgan Stanley Complaint Against ISO


We have good news on the ISO price caps front.  The FERC has made it
clear that ISO does not have the ability to mandate that generators sell to 
ISO at its price caps and that the proper response to inadequate supply is to 
lift the price caps.

On Friday, the FERC issued its Order on Complaint in connection with the July 
10 complaint filed by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. ("MS").  As you may 
recall, MS requested FERC to issue a stay of the ISO's maximum purchase price 
authority and to direct the ISO to reverse any price cap reductions.  MS 
sought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule 206(h), which was granted by 
FERC on the grounds that the complaint "warrants expeditious action."

As a quick background summary for you, last November, FERC issued an order 
approving Tariff Amendment 21 which extended ISO's price cap authority 
through 11/15/00.  That order stated that the ISO "maximum purchase price was 
not a cap on what the seller may charge the ISO, but a cap on what the ISO 
was willing to pay."  The Commission said that sellers dissatisfied with the 
price cap could "choose to sell those services into the California Power 
Exchange or bilateral markets."

FERC notes in Friday's Order that the 6/28 the ISO's Board resolution lowered 
the caps to $500 and ISO further directed that, "To the extent permitted by 
law, regulation and pre-existing contract, Management shall direct generators 
to bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds 38,000 MW."

The MS complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would, 
"threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace."  MS also requested 
an emergency technical conference to examine ISO's justification for the 
price cap reduction.

FERC denied the MS stay request, as well as its request that the $750 maximum 
purchase price be reinstated.  The Commission reiterates that it is not 
approving a cap on sellers' prices, because they can sell at whatever price 
they want.  Rather ISO has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to 
pay.  "Because sellers are not required to sell to the ISO, the ISO cannot 
dictate their price."

Importantly, however, FERC also states that, "ISO has no more or less ability 
to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services....if 
the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced 
purchase price ceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they 
choose), it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to 
meet its needs."  [Emphasis added]  FERC then notes that this may lead to an 
increase in Out of Market ("OOM") calls and that OOM calls are not subject to 
a maximum purchase price.

Also, with regard to the ISO's resolution stating that generators must bid 
their capacity into the ISO markets when system load exceeds 38,000 MW, FERC 
states clearly that, "such a requirement is not permitted by our November  12 
Order and the ISO tariff."  [Emphasis added]

FERC goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ISO in conjunction with a 
maximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ISO's market 
rules, which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to 
ISO's tariff.  This would require 60 days' advance notice, "and could not be 
implemented prior to Commission approval.  As stated above, our November 12 
Order was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate 
supply (due to a low maximum purchase price) is to raise the maximum purchase 
price."

ISO is then "put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be 
accompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper 
response to low supplies in the ISO markets."

Concurrences were filed by Commissioners Massey and Hebert.  Massey suggests 
that the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues, such as risk 
management tools, removing constraints on hedging opportunities, introducing 
real time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new 
generation and transmission projects in California.  Hebert says that the 
previous November Order tried to "straddle the fence" and that, "Today, the 
Commission at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction of 
recognizing that we have a role."  He then reiterates his preference for 
removing all price caps.  He also suggests that, "Getting to the bottom of 
the problem, in my view, requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our 
approval of the ISO as operator of the California grid.  The record supports 
such a move."  He refers approvingly to the Collins resignation letter, 
stating that it, "thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of a 
return to 'command and control.' "  Hebert states that, "The independence of 
the ISO's governing structure stands threatened.  We should 'stand up,' to 
quote the resignation letter."  Hebert advocates opening a section 206 
proceeding now, as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk power 
markets, "including the California markets."

This decision makes it clear that ISO cannot lower the caps at tomorrow's 
meeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at that 
price.  This is an important development and very good news in our ongoing 
efforts to seek economic sanity at the ISO.

Please call if you have any questions.

Dan

I agree with John's recommendations.
We have been doing surprisingly well in the press.  And, for the most part, 
those who write bad stuff are doing so based on ideology ... we are not going

Steve,

Please forgive the delay.  I was having trouble with my PC again (we have a 
replacement in the works).  We are discretely investigating this group a bit 
more, but the general conclusion is that they may be a front for one of the 
opposition groups.  We are preparing counter arguments for the general 
public, but do not see much value in opening a dialogue with this "group."  
We always have had opposition and we can expect that socialists etc. (some 
groups have boasted that they will storm the DPC fences on March 1) will 
begin to rally using us as a scapegoat for Maharashtra's financial 
difficulties.  At present, we are getting balanced press and I fear that any 
explanation/outreach to the most vitriolic opposition will be used against 
us.  I am available to discuss this at your convenience.

You had asked for my input on a response to a letter you received from Tom 
Donahue regarding increasing Enron's contribution to the US Chamber to 
$100,000.  I have been giving the Chamber a bit of a hard time lately and 
wanted you to know why.

I have been in touch with both Tom and his staff over the last year.  Donahue 
has done a very good job raising money and getting his membership rolls up, 
both in terms of membership and dollar contribution per member.  My 
reservation about the Chamber is that they won't take a stand on something 
which is in the best interests of the vast majority of their membership if it 
will alienate a vocal few.  Electric restructuring was a key example of 
this.  There was no doubt where they should have been on the issue, but 
instead of embracing retail open access legislation at the federal level they 
decided to have a "process".  Naturally, all the utilities volunteered to 
participate in the process and outnumbered the nonutility members when it 
came time to vote.  The vote supported wholesale, but not retail, reform 
(with heavy emphasis on ensuring stranded cost recovery).  Afterwards, the 
federal debate shifted solely to wholesale legislation (though this is not 
exclusively the Chamber's fault).

Unfortunately, Tom's forceful and competitive approach when it comes to 
raising his membership rolls leaves him unwilling to do the right thing if a 
few members will be upset.  For Enron it's a bit like paying $100,000 for a 
veto right.  The only things the organization pushes for are the things 
everyone agrees on in the business community -- eg China PNTR and lower 
corporate taxes -- things they will push for whether we pay dues or not (and 
things we will add our separate voice to in any event).  

As I have explained to the Chamber, Enron makes its money challenging 
conventional wisdom, changing the way markets work, and dislocating 
incumbents.  Anything important that we stand for is likely to alienate some 
members of the business community and the Chamber is unlikely to stand with 
us.  They represent the status quo in the business community.  Tom is an 
extremely promising leader; he needs to create a new kind of voice for the 
business community.  A voice which stands for moving business to the next 
level, not just protecting its current position.

Having said all that, the Chamber (particularly its international chapters) 
has been useful to us in the past.  In previous years, Donahue himself has 
intervened on our behalf with Latin American leaders.  As a consequence, I 
have asked them for a proposal which would allow us to remain Chamber members 
at a lower dues (and policy participation) level, but with continuing access 
to their international activities.  I suggested something in the $25,000 
range.  That's why they are approaching you (they want us to double our 
current dues to $100,000).

Currently, I am inclined to just withdraw from Chamber membership, but I plan 
to defer to Linda Robertson.  I am interested in your insights, or, if you 
prefer, you can simply refer them to Linda or me.

I think this letter looks fine.  For the hororarium, I suggest we use 
whatever we paid Kudlow for his participation (I believe Ken also entered 
into a consulting contract with Kudlow, but I'm referring only to the 
one-time payment for the advisory council meeting he attended).

Subject: Draft letter to Paul Joskow for Ken Lay

I INFORMALLY SOUNDED PAUL OUT, AND HE EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IF THE DATES WORK.
Possible letter to Paul Joskow from Ken Lay
Dear Paul:
    As you may have heard, Enron has an advisory committee consisting of 
leaders in the academic and business communities (list attached). This 
committee meets twice each year, along with invited speakers on subjects of 
interest to Enron. Top executives of our company do their best to attend.
    Starting on the afternoon of October 30, and concluding late in the day 
on October 31, we will be meeting in London. I was most impressed with your 
presentation at the Aspen Institute energy forum, and am hoping that you 
might consider joining our meeting to discuss "Where do we go from here: how 
to preserve the momentum of deregulation after California."
    We would be delighted to cover business class travel costs and all other 
expenses incident to your trip to London, including hotel costs should you 
choose to extend your stay for several days. In addition, there would be an 
honorarium of $XXXXXX. 
    Do try to join us: you will find the other speakers interesting, and 
London a delightful place in which to spend a bit of time. And we would 
benefit enormously from your participation.
                                                      Sincerely,

I have noticed a fairly significant typo in the note below. The correct date 
for the key note address is 26 October, as set out in my first note. Did that 
impact on the issue of availability?

Subject: Ken Lay/ Jeff Skilling visits

Ken Lay Visit. Following discussions with the Prime Minister's office and a 
quick check with venues 31 October is firming up as the preferred date for a 
meeting with the Prime Minister and an office opening by the PM. 

Jeff Skilling Visit. The Nikkei and the Tokyo University have now made the 
decision to invite Mr Skilling to give the key note address at the symposium 
on 26 November in Tokyo. As mentioned, the symposium is the most prestigious 
conference on IT in Japan.

While the conference itself receives significant media attention, the 
President of Nikkei has offered to interview Mr Skilling. This honour is 
usually reserved for Heads of State. The interview will be featured on the 
front page of the Nikkei and picked up by other major media services.

kind regards

Subject: Re: Ken Lay meeting with Japanese Prime Minister  

Ken Lay Visit. Balancing the need to push out the arrangement of high level 
meetings as far as possible with the desire to have a meeting with Prime 
Minister Mori prior to the US Presidential election, the week commencing 30 
October would be the optimum time for a visit by Mr Lay. PM Mori is generally 
available in that week. We will get a preferred time from the PM's chief 
secretary first thing tomorrow morning Tokyo time. 

Jeff Skilling Visit. The boards of Nikkei and Tokyo University Institute of 
Advanced Studies have yet to make a decision on the key note speaker for the 
one day invitation only seminar to be held on 26 October. As mentioned, the 
boards will choose between the chairman of Cisco and Jeff Skilling. The 
conference is focused on the IT revolution and an invitation only event for 
approximately 600 of Japan's corporate leaders.

The speaking panel and topics for discussion will be developed around the key 
note speaker. If Mr Skilling were to give the key note speech, it is likely 
that key senior Government Ministers would be asked to present at the 
seminar. 

Following the Prime Minister's commitment at the Okinawa summit of 
US$15billion expenditure in the region on IT infrastructure and education, 
Japan's focus on e-commerce is almost reaching fever pitch. There will be 
significant interest in the conference from senior levels of Government and 
the business community. Further, as you would expect with the involvement of 
the Nikkei, there is typically significant media coverage associated with the 
key note speaker's presentation.

kind regards

I had a hard time logging on remotely, so I just got this now.  As you can 
see, it's a relatively brief "overview" presentation for Jeff, not going into 
much of the detail surrounding, for example, performance criteria and 
evaluation or job classification (where much of the real work remains).  The 
main purpose of this presentation is to give Jeff something for the December 
Board meeting.

I need your thoughts on something: one of the rationales I had discussed with 
McKinsey for this new organizational approach was the need to win the war for 
talent.  A partnership at least theoretically creates unlimited opportunity 
and reduced hierarchy in an organization.  It also creates substantial upside 
opportunity and continued motivation for the business leadership.  My 
question for you and your team is where are we at risk in fact when it comes 
to attracting and retaining talent.  My suspicion is that our turnover is 
farily low, and that it is especially low in the top tiers of the 
organization.  Where we run into problems, my gut tells me, is that we have 
some difficulty getting the very best from the very best schools (ie we often 
lose out to the I-Banks and, perhaps McKinsey-level consulting firms) and 
that we have a tough time holding the most talented managers and directors 
(ie we're OK at the top livels already).  Could you have someone do an 
analysis of the turnover rates at different levels?  We may need to weed out 
the performance related departures (including those who left after getting a 
low performance ranking even if they were not officially terminated for 
performance reasons) if possible.

Steve,

Attached is a draft of the pack we plan to use in our discussion with Jeff
next week.  As you might imagine, we've been going through many iterations
of this document, and it is still very much a work-in-process.  Hopefully,
you can get a sense of the outline and where we are heading, but the
specific points on each page will continue to be wordsmithed.

We look forward to getting your reaction/feedback to the structure and
overall message.

Suzanne asked me to give you her home number, (713) 807-7788, where you can
reach her over the weekend.  Otherwise, please feel free to leave a
voicemail for either Suzanne (713) 751-4390 or me (214) 665-1754.

Thanks,
Dan Marcontell

Subject: Governor Ridge might call Ken Lay today

I just received a call from Bob O'Dell (215-569-5312) following up on the 
request from Mayor Edward Rendell regarding the upcoming Millennium 
Philadelphia's Light and Laser Show and Philadelphia 2000.  The Mayor has 
asked Enron for a $750,000 commitment.  As outlined in my December 6th memo 
-- the breakdown of the commitment was for Enron to contribute $500,000 for 
the Millennium Philadelphia's Light and Laser Show on December 31, 1999.  The 
$250,000 would be credited to Philadelphia 2000 Convention package.  The 
Mayor and Mr. Lay have spoken several weeks ago but no commitment was made at 
the time.  Will we be sponsoring the event?

Also, Bob gave us the heads up --- that Governor Tom Ridge (R-PA) will be 
calling Ken Lay this afternoon to ask Mr. Lay to be the chair/co-chair of the 
Republican Governors Association dinner that will be held in Washington, DC 
in February 2000.

Please let me know if you need additional information.

Thank you.

		 Subject: FERC/SEC Update

As you all may know, we have scheduled a conference call for the group for 
Thursday, Oct. 19.  Bernadette called each of your assistants, so it should 
be on your calendars.

As a brief update prior to our call:

We have a phone call in to FERC to check on the procedural status of the 
merger.  Donna Fulton, my colleague in Washington, has many contacts at FERC 
and is working with those people to learn what she can about the status of 
our proceeding.  

Joanne is supposed to be meeting with Bob Wasson at the SEC (along with Bill 
Weedon) early next week to get a sense of where the SEC is on the case.

Per Rick's suggestion, I have asked another colleague of mine in Washington, 
Chris Long, to help us decide who would be the appropriate person to make 
contact at the SEC if we decide to make that contact.  Chris is working with 
some political operatives on this.

We have been working with Portland General and Sierra on their RTO filing.  
As you may recall, a commitment to join an RTO (Regional Transmission 
Organization) is one of the things FERC will require of the merging parties.  
An RTO filing will be made at FERC on October 23.  While RTO progress has 
been good so far, Sierra and PGE have indicated that they may have concerns 
with the RTO they are working with (the Northwest RTO).  We are working with 
Sierra and PGE to make sure that they do not do anything in the RTO 
proceeding that could cause concern for FERC regarding the companies' 
commitment to join an RTO.

There was some question about the status of a temporary services company 
being created by the merged company.  Joanne has been working with the Sierra 
and PGE people on this issue and does not see this as being a problem now, 
but I have asked her for confirmation that this "alternative" type of service 
company arrangement will not delay the SEC proceeding.  I am waiting for a 
response from Joanne.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  

Sarah

Great summary.  I think the two main issues you raise are the right ones, but 
I have one other thought we should discuss internally.  Do we want to create 
a set of incentives for the management of PJM that would entitle management 
to incentive compensation to the extent they meet certain goals -- eg 
relieving congestion on the grid, increasing throughput across the 
transmission system, expediting interconnection (measured in terms of actual 
interconnections not just applications approved), etc.  This way we could 
create an organization that would have the incentive to make a workable and 
open transmission system.

Attached is a summary of the PJM RTO order.  While it is somewhat lengthy, 
the order has a lot of good information in it that I wanted to share with the 
group, particularly the Commission's statements regarding the existing 
configuration of the northeast and the need to expand it.

We are working on summaries of the New York and New England RTO orders and 
will have those out shortly.  If you would like copies of the orders, just 
let us know.

We expect the mediation proceeding to begin within the next week.  We will 
keep you updated.

I am pleased to advise you that Enron will be one of the sponsors of the 2000 
Synergy Awards, an annual event organized by the Citizens' Environmental 
Coalition.  The Synergy Awards are given "in recognition of progress, 
achievement, hard work and/or resourceful stewardship in a broad spectrum of 
environmental endeavors."

The sponsorship will allow Enron 8 seats at the awards ceremony, which will 
be the evening of Wednesday, November 8, at the Main Street Theater at 
Chelsea Market.  They are describing it as "lighthearted and informal, 
featuring comedians from Houston's Radio Music Theater."

Are you or any members of your team are interested in attending?  If so, 
please respond to Stacy Walker at x3-3583.

Thanks, Kelly

Subject: part time/reduced hour employees



Cindy I chatted with Elyse (Elizabeth Labanowski never returned my calls or 
messages) on the pt/rh issue.   Elyse is in favor of having the pt/rh 
employees in the regular PRC process, with education for managers and at 
facilitator training and a statement in the ground rules to ensure that they 
are not penalized or otherwise disadvantaged by the process.  

David and I discussed this option which he is in favor of it as well.  In the 
meantime for year end we will be ready with a system change to allow us to 
see pt/rh employees on the screen segregated from the full timers- and to 
have a live chart of pt/rh employees as well as the full timers.  We can't do 
that for mid-year because it requires a good deal of programming, but it is a 
feature we can incorporate at year end.  

what do you think?

I'll be happy to accomodate.  I can take you through Enron's view of how 
markets overall are evolving and how we approach those markets.  I'd also 
like to spend some time reviewing interstate transmission policy and how it 
affects Western energy markets.

Subject: Wyoming Energy Commission subject

Steve, it was great to meet you and hear your remarks yesterday.  For the 
speaking engagement next Wednesday, I would like you to focus upon the Enron 
strategic model of virtual integration of market forces in the evolution of 
energy development.  Wyoming represents a huge material resource base and the 
commission is charged with the development and promotion of such.  But the 
Governor's message is that we cannot see ourselves as producers and exporters 
in the traditional sense.  We will continue to have the status of a colony if 
we do not recognize the new dynamics of how these market places are 
evolving.  If you set the stage with a presentation of Enron strategy, then 
we will discuss how a state, with its agencies and auathority can play a role 
in this evolution.  I have set your time for 45 minutes, which can include a 
short Qand A period.  But your message can be as succint as you can make it 
and get the point across.  You may have to present the Enron case a number of 
different ways, but the Governor will give you latitude to make the point.   
You will be welcome to participate in a following panel which will address 
role playing by the state and the commission.  Plan to join us for lunch.  If 
you need more detail, let me know.  Thanks!  Stephen

Follow up to previous message:  I would not have "managing for the slow down" 
on the agenda.  I don't think it is as relevant to our business as it is to 
many others.

Subject: Funky Business

Steve,

Have you had a chance to look at the book "Funky Business" and to give any 
thought to having Jonas present at the Management Conference?  I know you 
have a thousand other things on your plate, not the least of which is 
California, so I understand if the answer is no.  However, they've been 
contacted by someone else about the date so we may be forced to decide rather 
soon.

On a related subject, I'm contemplating another topic for the conference.  
I'd seen an article in Fortune several months ago titled "Managing for the 
Slowdown."  It talked about new challenges managers face in light of the 
economic downturn.  (Most young managers have never experienced anything but 
boom times.)  The article also outlines a dozen or so things companies should 
be thinking about now.  (Use the downturn as a new opportunity to evaluate 
people.  Overhaul your budget process.  Don't stop communicating. etc.)  I 
think it would be beneficial to address similar strategies and ideas with our 
managers.  I'd love to get your thoughts on this idea.  (Is it appropriate 
for Enron or am I just seeing the world through bleak-colored glasses?)

 Terrie:

 We received an e-mail today from the Funky Business office asking about the
 date we have on hold with Enron.  They have another inquiry about that date 
and
 wondered if Enron is still considering using Jonas.  If you are still
 considering them I will keep him on hold.  And if they get a firm offer I 
will
 let you know immediately.  We will have 24 hours to make an offer or release
 the hold once a firm offer comes in from another company.

 Hope you had a great 4th of July,

Steve,

Appreciate the call this morning. It is good to learn from an expert that 
shares the same type of market-driven approach to policy in energy as we do 
in broadband deployment. We are not energy experts, but will do our best to 
get up to speed and take more active role in long-term solution.

I will keep all of these documents confidential, but would like to use some 
of the data points  to create an action plan from high-tech that we can 
share with others such as HP, Intel, Novell, Solectron, National 
Semiconductor and others that have engaged in this issue. Let's discuss 
tomorrow afternoon. As I mentioned, we (Silicon Valley cos.) have meetings 
in the morning and evening on 2/15 with Gov. Davis and will be discussing 
energy crisis.

Thanks,

Laura

I've revised it a bit to read:   "Enron supports market-based initiatives 
that create efficient, cost-effective and environmentally sound energy 
systems.  As a company, we use our global networks to provide innovative 
solutions that help the world meet its energy needs while reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions."

Unfortunately, they have given me very short notice and would like an answer 
by COB today.   If you could let me know sometime today if this is OK to run, 
I'd appreciate it.

Thanks,

Steve:

On Tuesday, January 30, 2001, selected business units within EES will be 
sharing their business and marketing plans for 2001. These plans incorporate 
the lessons learned from last's year activities. The Bear Trap program was 
initiated two years ago to help our Origination teams filter down the 
universe of prospects to those offering the best probability of closing 
deals. 

This year we will have the most comprehensive Bear Trap session ever.  We 
want you to be part of this exciting process and to broaden the relationship 
we have with you and your teams.  Come and join me on Tuesday, January 30th, 
at the Aerial Theater in Bayou Place, downtown Houston, starting at 7:00 AM 
with breakfast and continuing until 5:30 PM.  If you have not RSVP'd yet, 
please have your office call Julie Davidson at x- 36882 to confirm your 
attendance.

See you there.

Marty Sunde

We met with the legislator who is in charge of the Summer 2001
subcommittee today to discuss Enron's buy down proposal.  Dave Freeman
had discussed the idea with her previously, however, his version
required that the contract be for a pre-arranged price, based on the
notice you were given presumably by the ISO, i.e. 24 hours = x, 12 hours
= y, etc.  Consequently, her concern with our proposal was the
uncertainty of allowing customers to choose whether or not they want to
shut down based on price versus requiring them to shut down to meet
demand, i.e. a modified interruptable.

She requested that we provide her with information about existing buy
down programs and their successes.

University System

Rosalee,

I have left Ken a voicemail request but thought I would follow up with a note 
to you that might help clarify the request.

As Ken knows, Enron Energy Services recently won a STAY by the 9th Circuit 
Court of an order by a lower court to require us to provide electricity 
service to the UC/CSU systems directly versus via using PG&E and SCE 
service.  The formal court hearing of the appeal is still scheduled for 60 to 
90 days from now.  
We would like Ken to phone Charlie Reed, Chancellor of CSU,  and solicit 
Charlie's support for Enron, CSU, and the UC system to get back together to 
attempt to work out a commercial resolution to these issues.  
We believe that sponsorship and support coming from the most senior 
executives' offices will help bring the parties together.  
Additionally, if CSU and UC are interested in working out a settlement, we 
would like to solicit their joint request for a delay in the court calendar.  
This would allow both teams to focus on a commercial resolution versus 
splitting their focus between a settlement and preparing briefs for the 
appeal appearance.  We would like to see a delay request of one month, as 
long as the setttlement discussions progress.  
A desirable way to kick off settlement discussions would be to ask Ken to 
have lunch with the Head of UC , Charlie Reed of CSU, and perhaps one 
business lead (in this case, this could be me).  I am not sure that Ken's 
schedule could accomadate that, but I thought I would ask.  If timing is bad 
for a meeting like this, we can find a different alternative.    

I will follow up with a phone call to you.  Hope this helps.

Eliz -- I need your group to put together a search which captures the 
comments of PG&E and Edison officials in trade press, anlyst reports, and 
speeches which would be inconsistent with the idea that they can now recover 
their shortfall.  In other words, when they were trying to get AB 1890 
passed, when they were fighting Proposition 9, when they floated their "rate 
reduction bonds" and when they talked to analysts and rating agencies I'm 
sure they assumed that they would live under the rate freeze and take the 
risk of stranded cost recovery whithin the statutory deadline.

California Utilities' LossesOn Electricity Pose Risk

By REBECCA SMITH

Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

California's two biggest utilities are losing so much
money buying electricity in the state's deregulated
market that they have run up deficits equivalent to half
their net worth in just four months.

If the cost of wholesale power continues to exceed the
price these utilities are allowed to bill their
customers, as currently seems likely, they could become
technically insolvent sometime next year. That would put
pressure on regulators to orchestrate a
multibillion-dollar public bailout, similar to the "too
big to fail'' response that in the past pushed
governments to rescue banks.

Such a scenario is quietly being discussed by bond-rating
concerns that recently reduced their credit outlooks for
Pacific Gas & Electric Co., a unit of San Francisco-based
PG&E Corp., and Southern California Edison, a unit of
Edison International of Rosemead, Calif. Bond- rating
concerns say they aren't sure how much additional debt
can be borne by the two affected utilities before they
will have difficulty paying their bills.

Probe of California Power Prices Begins, but New Plants
Aren't Seen as Solution (Sept. 11)

Los Angeles Utility Is Benefitting, Surprisingly, From
Deregulation (Sept. 6)

California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Electricity Costs
(Sept. 1)
"If this is just a seasonal aberration, the utilities can
get through it," says Lori Woodland, analyst for Fitch
IBCA. "If it goes on for six or nine months, it's a very
serious situation." Adds A.J. Sabatelle, senior credit
officer at Moody's Investors Service Inc.: "At some
point, you have a financial crisis."

The utilities say they are having no difficulty meeting
expenses and don't envision problems in servicing their
debts. But they are vigorously lobbying state and federal
regulators to change the rules of the game, hoping
somehow to raise rates to make up for the shortfall. The
California utilities' experience may be a harbinger of
what could happen in other states where wholesale power
prices have surpassed the amount that utilities are
allowed to charge their ratepayers.

For now, utilities are making ends meet by going to the
financial markets to borrow money. PG&E, a giant utility
that serves one out of every 20 Americans, is seeking
approval to increase its debt capacity by $1.4 billion.
It is borrowing $200 million, while Edison is tapping
$250 million from the commercial paper market. "This is
going to be a long, tough road," says Jim Scilacci, chief
financial officer for Southern California Edison.

Today's situation represents a complete turnabout from
what was expected when California deregulated its energy
market on March 31, 1998, which opened electricity
pricing to competition. California tried to give its
utilities a competitive edge nationally by deregulating
faster than other states and by creating a mechanism to
allow investor-owned utilities, such as PG&E and Edison,
to quickly pay down debts incurred to serve customers
under the old regulatory system.

To do this, the state legislature set retail rates at
high levels, which, at first, generated fat surpluses for
the utilities. As the money piled up, utilities used it
to pay down debts for generation facilities that were
otherwise unprofitable in the new deregulated world. By
the end of this June, PG&E and Edison together had
collected more than $12 billion and were on track to
finish paying down debts well ahead of the March 31,
2002, deadline set by the legislature. At that point,
rate freezes were to end and retail prices were to
fluctuate with the market.

But all that went out the window in June, when wholesale
power prices surged, topping the rates the utilities were
allowed to charge retail customers. Average prices at
state-sanctioned energy markets were four to five times
the prices of a year earlier, and three to four times the
level utilities could charge customers.

The accumulated shortfall has been so enormous at PG&E,
that analysts expect its deficit to exceed $3 billion by
Oct. 31, more than half its shareholder equity of $5.7
billion, which is defined as assets minus liabilities.
Southern California Edison finished August with a deficit
of $2 billion, equivalent to almost two-thirds its net
worth of $3.2 billion. The utilities, though they have
been accumulating deficits, aren't required to report
these as losses on their earnings statements.

That leaves utilities in a bind. They want to end the
rate freeze to be able to pass on the real cost of
electricity to consumers. But should the freeze end
before the statutory deadline of 2002, they get
clobbered. That is because they will immediately have to
book a loss on their power-purchase deficits. What's
more, they can't use the proceeds from planned
power-plant sales to cover those losses; instead, should
the freeze end, they will be obliged to refund some of
the proceeds to ratepayers. In PG&E's case, the refunds
could total $500 million, while in Edison's case, the
amount is $254 million.

Publicly at least, utility executives insist a mechanism
will be found to let them recoup the money spent on
electricity.

Consumer advocates are gearing up for the fight. Nettie
Hoge, executive director for San Francisco consumer group
Utility Reform Network, says ratepayers shouldn't end up
footing the bill for a deal cut by utilities that
benefited them before prices shot up.

Utility executives are now distancing themselves from the
legislation that got them into such a mess, which was
drafted with their assistance. PG&E Chairman Robert Glynn
says it is best not to "overanalyze" the "old deal."
Instead, he says, regulators and legislators should sit
down with utilities and construct a new agreement, since
"it's in the broad interests of the state not to have
critical energy infrastructure look like a leper."

Mr. Glynn says the current deal offers "mutually assured
destruction" to both utilities and ratepayers. Something
must be done, he says, or consumers throughout most of
the state will experience "a San Diego-style rate shock."
The utility serving that city, San Diego Gas & Electric
Co., ended its freeze a year ago and began passing
wholesale power costs directly through to ratepayers.
Legislators intervened this summer, however, and
temporarily capped retail rates when monthly power bills
nearly tripled. The utility, a unit of Sempra Energy, is
also accumulating a deficit as a result.

So long as banks and bond markets believe the utilities
will be repaid, they will be able to borrow, analysts
say. "Until we hear politicians of consequence state
otherwise, our position is that we believe the utilities
will be made whole," says Richard Cortright, a director
at Standard & Poor's corporate ratings group.

But that opinion could change if it looks like the
utilities will have to swallow a big loss. The result:
lower credit ratings that would raise borrowing costs and
could trigger a downward spiral. "You're talking about
top-rated companies, though," said Ms. Woodland of Fitch
IBCA. "To get to insolvency, a lot would have to happen."

In the meantime, utilities are doing all they can to
control the hemorrhaging. They have gotten authority from
regulators to buy more power under long-term contracts at
fixed prices, reducing their vulnerability to spot-market
volatility. And they have petitioned federal regulators
to declare California's market so badly flawed that
generators should be denied market pricing and, even,
ordered to pay refunds.

Nevertheless, several forces are working against them.
Although they can sign bilateral contracts, prices remain
high for those as well. What's more, they can't buy less
power than their customers need. If they don't buy
enough, the California Independent System Operator, the
organization responsible for reliability, will step in
and make purchases for them and send them the bill.

Perhaps the biggest problem facing PG&E and Edison,
though, is one of timing. The California legislature is
out of session until December, and regulators haven't
even really started to address the issue formally. In the
meantime, the utilities' deficit is growing by tens of
millions of dollars daily.

Mark:

I am looking at a proposal, under which a Russian oil-major would be wishing 
to sell Iraqui crude to us, coming from the UN oil-for-food program. I would 
be interested to learn, whether Enron can purchase crude oil from this 
program (provided that we receive proof that it comes out of the UN program) 
and whether we are willing to do it (corporate policy).

I want to check that out first, before going forward. Next step would be to 
receive a good level of confidence that the offer is genuine, and then I 
would talk to the liquids traders.

Best regards,
Wolfgang

Pete van de gohm suggested we might want to get something out on the mideast 
situation as well -- a sort of travel advisory.  Please follow up with him.  
I know that for our mideast project people we have been taking care of this 
in David Haug's old organization.  See if there is anything else we need to 
be doing.  Dennis Vegas may be able to provide you with a way to get the info

Mike - I've spoken to my contacts at State and
Defense.  They both are saying that their people in
Colombia are on high alert - no unnecessary travel,
fully armored vehicles when available, changing time
and routes, etc. - as they fully expect FARC and ELN
to react violently to the initiation of US aid later
this month.  They believe that the terrorists will go
after easily recognizable but soft targets that are
clearly American.  That pretty much means American
corporations whose presence can be identified and who
don't have visible security.  The Embassy understands
that companies like Coca Cola have removed all expats.
 I asked if the Embassy officers have been able to
move about the cities and they replied "Of course, but
they don't do it as much as they did and are more
careful now."  Cali and Medellin are regarded as more
dangerous that Bogota and U.S. official travel to them
is at a minimum. Travel in the countryside is
absolutely forbidden except by helicopter.

Hope this helps.  Let's face it, you can operate
anywhere as long as you are careful... - Phil

I think I can recommend that the time be set aside, but it would be helpful 
if we pointed out to Emerson that it must be clear that there is a clear 
opportunity for Enron before we schedule the meeting.  Maybe you could use 
this to get some progress on a bundled outsource deal.

		 Subject: RE: Dates for Emerson Meeting

Gentlemen:

Situation:

Emerson is aggressively seeking at least a three hour time slot for a meeting 
with Jeff Skilling in April or May 2001.  Mr. Skilling's office is hesitant 
to allocate more than two hours without your recommendation.  Emerson is 
being persistent.

The key players from Emerson are David Farr, newly appointed CEO, and James 
Berges, President and effectively the leader of Emerson's strategic 
development effort.  It is anticipated that both would attend the meeting.

Emerson execs want to (i) get to know Mr. Skilling and other senior 
management, (ii) discuss mutual business opportunities, and (iii) hold a 
discussion about the transformation of Enron from a pipeline company to its 
current form.  The last point has to do with Emerson's continuing 
self-transformation effort and how Enron achieved its transformation.

I need your advice and recommendation.  Please respond by e-mail or telephone 
(x5-4040).


Background:

Emerson initiated this latest round of contact with Enron in November 2000, 
when Mike Train and Mark Proudfoot, both Emerson VPs of Corporate 
Development, visited the Enron building hosted by Steve Kean.  I met them at 
that time.

Since that initial meeting, Emerson has aggressively pursued a business joint 
venture as preferred supplier with Martin Wenzel and the distributed power 
business, I believe with promising results.  My sense is that Emerson is 
uniquely positioned as EES' partner in that business.  I am waiting to 
receive an update from Martin.

Emerson is also interested in becoming a preferred supplier for EES's DSM 
business.  While we generally support that idea, we are pressing Emerson to 
reciprocate by becoming a customer of our bundled outsource business.  
Emerson is highly decentralized, and our efforts to date have been 
unsuccessful.

I want to use the meeting as an opportunity to press Emerson to consider a 
proposal from EES's bundled outsource business.

Please let me know your recommendation on this matter.

Thanks,

Nate

Nate,

Thanks for the note - - I have dropped some ideas to Thad to follow up on
during my absence from the office.

I am a little nervous about having only two hours - - is it possible to get
a larger block of time to get to know each other better and talk through
some of the mutual business opportunities?

Mike

Your assessment makes perfect sense to me.  What do you think about having 
Nels make the call to Lundquist just to find out what his status is, what he 
might look for when his current assignment is over, etc.  (obviously without 
identifying us -- presumably Nels would have reason to talk to him anyway in 
the normal course of business)?  I am not wedded to the idea but am inclined 
toward at least getting the information, unless you see a problem.

		 Subject: Andrew Lundquist

I got your message about Andrew.  He would be an excellent catch.  However, I 
see a couple of significant problems.  My guess is that Andrew is too senior 
for this position, particularly after having chaired the Cheney task force.  
Also, I would not anticipate that he would be available for several months, 
if then.  We should fill this position immediately.  We are already missing 
opportunities because this position is vacant. 

As for our search, using Korn Ferry, I have narrowed the field to two very 
good candidates.   I am setting up time for Rick to interview these 
candidates next Monday.  The first candidate is Drew Maloney with Rep. Tom 
Delay's office.  Drew would give us enormous visibility in House Republican 
leadership circles, seems trustworthy, and capable of learning most of the 
substance of the energy portfolio.  Drew has strong networking skills, which 
I think would nicely fit with Tom's strategic and technical skills.  The 
second candidate is John Shelk, whom I have known for nearly 15 years.  John 
was the lead Republican staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committee 
under Norm Lent.  John left the Committee in 1992.  Since then John has 
worked in the financial services and gaming industries, where he has enhanced 
his political and Republican networking skills.  John in very short order 
would have extremely strong technical skills, atlhough he has been away from 
the industry for eight years.  I believe both candidates bring different but 
very strong talents to the job.  I have a second opening for an enviromental 
advocate.  I am discussing with Rick the possibility of whether we could 
redirect one of these candidates (probably John) to that slot.   That said, 
please let me know if I should have Nels pursue Andrew.

Out-of-state generators pull plug over uncertainty on price controls
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 3, 2001)=20
Confused by the federal government's new controls on electricity prices,=20
generators withheld so much power from California on Monday that the state=
=20
was nearly plunged into rolling blackouts, state officials said.=20
The confusion began when the state's electric grid operators declared a Sta=
ge=20
1 power alert in the early afternoon, triggering the price caps for the fir=
st=20
time since they went into effect June 21.=20
Out-of-state generators pulled about 1,500 megawatts of electricity off the=
=20
table at midafternoon, enough to power about 1.1 million homes, because of=
=20
uncertainty about how much they could charge under the new Federal Energy=
=20
Regulatory Commission pricing system, said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesperson for=
=20
the state Department of Water Resources. The department buys electricity fo=
r=20
the state's financially distressed utilities.=20
"They didn't understand what they were going to be paid; there was confusio=
n=20
over the FERC order," Hidalgo said. "We saw 1,500 megawatts disappear."=20
The problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West, which forced=20
California to compete with other states for scarce electricity, he said.=20
Rolling blackouts hit southern Nevada.=20
Most California officials credit the FERC system, which is based on a=20
variable price cap, with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power=
=20
market. But power generators have complained that the price caps, by limiti=
ng=20
profits, could discourage the production of critically needed electricity.=
=20
And as Monday's episode suggested, even the uncertainty about where the cap=
=20
will fall could lead to unexpected shortages.=20
"That's the risk that you run (with price controls)," said Arthur O'Donnell=
,=20
editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets. "People want any kind o=
f=20
certainty at all."=20
Hidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last-minute import=
s=20
from the Bonne=0F'ville Power Administration, the federal agency that marke=
ts=20
government-produced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest. The state=

California. But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early=20
afternoon, signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7=20

Because of a steep drop in the price of natural gas, which fuels many=20
California power plants, suppliers knew the cap would fall. But no one knew=

The ceiling for California fell to about $77 at 3 p.m. but was back up to $=

In my interview I stressed that a big part of the communication problem is 
the narrow and impermanent nature of the information about what's going on at 
Enron.  Narrow because for every significant activity there are only a few 
who are in the loop and "impermanent" because very little information is 
committed to writing (most of it is exchanged in person or over the phone).  
This is, I believe, what lies at the heart of complaints about 
cross-department communication.  We now have some solutions emerging -- 
software that enables more people to record and post information in HTML 
format on company intranet sites.  I suspect that using such tools will face 
two obstacles: learning how to use them (ie there's a huge need for training) 
and making it part of our culture as a knowledge/learning organization

Subject: Computer Based Communications Training Initiative

As agreed in our V&V meeting today I have attached two items for your review:
1. A list of those who have been interviewed or have been part of a focus 
group on this subject.

The input from individuals on this list will be the basis for developing the 
5-7 key scenarios that will be a part of the training.  Please let me know if 
you feel we should include more people from your unit to insure that your 
unit's unique circumstances are appropriately taken into account.  If so, let 
us know either their names or how you would like them to be identified.

Some of the individuals on this list will be contacted as Subject Matter 
Experts to help provide real Enron contexts for the scenarios as they are 
further developed.

2. A list of the "first draft" objectives for the program and 10 possible 
scenarios.

Since we will only be able to have a total of about 5-7 scenarios in the 
final version, identify the 5 - 7 on this list of high level scenario ideas 
that will have the most impact on improving communications and the most 
applicability to a range of managers across the Enron organization.  Any 
other feedback you can provide on the objectives or scenarios would be 
greatly appreciated.

We are seeking to move forward with the development of scenarios by the 
beginning of next week.  Therefore, if you could provide your feedback on 
both of the items above by Friday, August 18th, it would be greatly 
appreciated.

Sen Wyden called Jeff Skilling and I subsequently spoke to his staffer, 
Joshua Sheinkman.

As you know, Wyden wants to introduce legislation to facilitate disclosure of 
operating information about the electric grid and is now looking for more 
details.  Wyden is not interested in pressing for additional disclosure of 
financial information.
The additional details they are looking for include: what information should 
be made available; when should it be made available, how should it be made 
available and who should make it available.  On this last point, I suggested 
that the legislation should apply to the transmission system operator, 
whoever that is (i.e. it could be an investor owned utility, a publicly-owned 
utility, an ISO or an RTO).  I also pointed out that FERC could make this 
happen by itself, except in the case of public utilities like BPA.  Extending 
FERC jurisdiction to these entities could be among the main benefits of the 
legislation.
Alan, please pull together the recommendations on each of these issues and 
forward to Linda. Linda, after we have the information (and perhaps some 
legislative language to go with it) please forward to Joshua at 
joshua_sheinkman@wyden.senate.gov.
Wyden would like our help in getting Sen Nickles to cosponsor the 
legislation.  (Linda)
It may also be useful to suggest a letter from wyden to FERC asking them to 
use their existing authority to start these disclosures as soon as possible 
for those entities wver which they have jurisdiction. (Linda and Joe)

thanks for your help in preparing for the Texas hearing.  I think Texas 
legislators are viewing the California experience in the proper context and I 
think I was at least marginally articulate on the emissions issues as well.

thanks again.

Thanks.  We are preparing a memo (John has seen it) to go out to each of our 
offices telling them about this incident (and the related ones that occurred 
the same day) and including some tips on how to handle such confrontations in 
the future.

Steve/Mark,

I have looked into the demonstration by the ACORN group which occurred on 5/21
at our New York Office (780 3rd Ave). I believe you are well aware of the
incident as the office there immediately contacted Mark Palmers group. I will
respond to the building management to discuss security issues and to gain a
better understanding of the security posture of the facility. If you have any
questions or require further follow-up please let me know. - John P.

John

I have just gotten off the phone with the building management for our facility
in New York. We were picketed at 780 3rd Ave and the 100 picketeers stormed 
the
lobby. We will accrue some additional costs for added security and apparatntly
the local police were not really on top of the deal. He would like us to 
provide
any advance notice if we ever have access to this information. Our office was
spared as thet shut down the elevators during the disturbance.

He will be happy to speak with you.

I am on my cell     713.560.7763

Subject: FERC Presentation on California/West Wholesale Market

Last Thursday, I made the first attached presentation to the FERC Staff at 
the power marketer's meeting on the FERC's investigation of the wholesale 
market in the West (and in particular California).  Ellen Wolf (of Tabors 
Caramanis) and I created this presentation building on previous presentations 
by Tim Belden and Dave Parquet.  In the presentation and the meeting we made 
the following points:
There isn't much FERC can do because the cause of the price spikes is not in 
the wholesale market.  We discouraged FERC from taking any action that would 
hurt the vibrant wholesale market in the California and the rest of the West 
as well.
High prices logically resulted from scarcity and if the Commission does 
anything it should (1) investigate whether market power was being exercised 
by any party and, (2) if necessary to protect the market (while still 
incenting needed generation) establish a price cap at a scarcity rent level 
equal to the price at which loads were willing to interrupt.  
The IOUs have not properly prepared for the risk of high prices caused by 
scarcity.  They have failed to hedge and have underscheduled their load, 
therefore having to fill a large percentage of their load at ISO real time 
prices.  My analogy was that this was like day trading your retirement fund 
as an asset allocation scheme.
The market would function better if more information was provided to the 
market.
The Commission should do whatever it can to incent participation by load.
To see the presentation, detach, save, and view in Powerpoint.  When you do, 
you will find there are many "hidden" slides that were not part of the oral 
presentation but were provided to Staff in hard copy for additional 
information.

According to the head of the investigation (Scott Miller), the staff got alot 
more out of this meeting than Staff's previous meetings with the IOUs and the 
generators.  Based on the numerous phone calls I've been getting, the Staff 
is looking into the data we provided.  

I have also attached a revised version of the presentation that Tim sent to 
Scott Miller on Friday.  Tim's version conveys the same message but takes a 
different approach to conveying the message.  On Friday, Tim talked to Scott 
and answered some additional questions.  Tim said that Enron is in favor of 
eliminating the mandatory PX buying requirement and would like the IOUs to be 
able to buy from Enron Online.  He also explained more fully the existence of 
scarcity .

 Steve, for the last two years I have been working for Shelley and my 
responsibilities include working with the ETS  and NBPL to determine our 
positions as it relates to the standardization process at GISB.  In the last 
budget process, it was decided to reduce our level of support at GISB and my 
position will be eliminated March 31.  I have been working with Cindy and her 
Redeployment Team to look at other opportunities within Enron but to date, I 
have not received an offer.  I would be interested in talking to someone in 
your organization about any opportunities within Government Affairs.  If 
there are any opportunities in your areas, could you direct me to the 
appropriate person?  

    Thanks!

      Tammy Hopkins

You do not need to real Catherine McKalip-Thompson's full trip report from 
her European venture, but you did express some surprise that on her trip to 
Europe she went beyond policy and discussed "busienss" or commercial 
activities, as I recall our conversation.  her note below makes clear, to me, 
that partnerships and investments were discussed with, inter alia, a Dutch 
distribution company, Credit Lyonnais, and CGU (an insurer).  Just FYI.   mcs

John,

Attached is my trip report for Amsterdam, Paris and London - I've given the 
contact information for everyone to Kathy to be entered in the database and 
thank you notes are going out today.  

The company meetings did not go quite as well as I might have hoped (Edon was 
not so interested), but we need to discuss further the potential relationship 
with Credit Lyonnais' effort to develop the "gap financing" fund.UNEP 
conference not as billed but some contacts there such as Credit Suisse First 
Boston and Gerling's Sustainable Development Company were useful as both are 
quite interested in climate change business opportunities.  Also it provided 
a chance to gather interesting updated info on current financial-sustainable 
development metrics, links, funds, firms, etc.  Discussions with participants 
in the UK Emissions Trading group were interesting and I now have several 
working papers on this effort which I can distribute to anyone who is 
interested (though Mark's group probably has them already but I'll check with 
them directly on that). I did not get the chance to meet up with Nicola Steen.

Catherine

I thought I would let you know that tonight on the Jim Lehrer Newshour on PBS 
they had a lengthy segment on California power prices.  While I took issue 
with some elements of the story, on balance it was one of the more calm and 
rational stories on the issue I have seen.  It might be worth obtaining a

Have we suggested to FERC staff that they force the ISO and PX to open the 
"blackbox" to show how they determine dispatch?  In addtion, if you are not 
on the distribution list for Belden's memo on utility behavior in California 
this summer, I will forward it to you.  It suggests some other areas FERC

		 Subject: Mexican Energy Secretary Marten's meeting with Dr. Lay

Rick,

As you know, last week I had a meeting with Fernando Alonso who is the head 
of Investment Promotion at the Mexican Department of Energy.  We discussed 
the gas price policy, electric deregulation and the role that Enron has been 
playing and can play in all these matters.

I pointed to him that Presidents Bush and Fox were geting together on 
February 16th and that President Fox has been declaring to the media that he 
will talk about a common energy policy with President Bush.  

We agreed that it would be useful for Secretary Martens to Meet with Dr. Lay 
before the Presidents meet.  Fernando Alonso admitted to me today that 
Secretary Martens wanted to hear Mr. Lays opinion on this subject and perhaps 
recieve some advice with respect to talking points for President Fox with 
President Bush regarding energy policy.

Secretary  Marten's  team(and now the Secretary himself) view Mr. Lay as an 
ideal communication link between the Mexican and the U.S. Governments for 
energy policy.  This is the reason why the Secretary wants to meet with Mr. 
Lay before the 16th.  Originally they had agreed on meeting on Feb. 12th at 
9:00 a.m. Nevertheless, President Fox has asked that Secretary Martens to 
meet him in Mexico City on Monday the 12th which is why I got a call from 
Fernando Alonso asking if Mr. Lay could see Secretary Martens on Sunday the 
11th between 3:00 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.  

Secretary Martens has to be at a CERA dinner on Sunday at 7:00 p.m.

Fernando Alonso, Dionisio Perez-Jacome, Undersecretary Niceforo Guerrero and 
myself will be meeting tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. to talk about electric 
deregulation.  They are expecting an answer from me by then.

Dionisio Perez-Jacome president of the CRE (FERC equivalent) is going to be 
in Houston on Monday the 12th.  I would like you and Steve Kean to meet with 
him if you are going to be in town.  I would also like to organize a tour for 
him that day.  We'll talk about this tomorrow night when I see you.

Thanks for your support.

Ricardo

Got your message.  I'm testifying at the Congressional hearing and Dasovich 
is covering FERC.  I think Jeff's comments were taken out of context.  He 
said policymakers do need to take care of small customers whose bills are 
tripling.  Frankly, we'd get slaughtered if we said anything else.  But he 
also said there is a right way and a wrong way to do it.  Enron and others 
had provided a market based answer by offering a fixed price deal to SDG&E 
(which would have enabled them to cap rates to those who had not switched.  
California elected instead to cap rates and deficit spend (ie create a 
deferral account).  I don't think we can stand for anything that doesn't 
protect the small customers, but we can continue to emphasize the market 
based solutions.  One of the messages in my testimony will be: customers 
should be encouraged to choose.  Those who did are doing fine.

I just wanted to send you a quick note to let you know that I'm outta here!

Today is my last day in the office here at Azurix, and in the coming months, 
I will start in a new position as SVP in the LNG development group at El Paso 
Energy.  This happened very quickly, and I wanted to make sure that I let 
everyone know before I left.

I don't have any contact information yet for my new job, but if you want to 
reach me, you can do so at RobBrnglsn@aol.com or at 713-664-7478.

I enjoyed working with all of you during the past five years at Enron / 
Azurix, and I wish you all of the best.

Take care.

Rob Bryngelson

PS -- There is a happy hour tonight at Scudeiros on Dallas Street (just west 
of the Met Garage) beginning around 5:00.  If you can make it, please come!

E-Mail Subject: GlobalCashExchange can establish Enron with corporate CFOs  
and treasurers worldwide


Dear Jeff:

I have worked with Ken Lay and others at Enron through the World Economic  
Development Congress where we brought together ministers of finance and oil  
immediately prior to the IMF/World Bank Meeting. 

InfrastructureWorld, of which I am co-founder and vice chairman, has 
recently  received $10 million each in funding from the IFC division of the 
World Bank and  Bechtel. GlobalCashExchange is a separate, but related 
business. We have the  plan, the experienced management team and proven 
technology, and we will be  selecting major financial institution as a 
partner. 

At the request of our corporate CFOs we are developing an internet based  
exchange for foreign exchange, short-term cash and credit that could give 
Enron  a powerful product to sell to corporations worldwide. I have attached 
and  executive summary and a business plan. I would like to discuss this with 
you at  your earliest convenience.

Major sources of trade, development and investment friction and inefficiency  
in large developing countries in particular include the facilitation of 
foreign  exchange, short term cash, credit and working capital transactions. 
This is a  source of high cost and frustration even for major global 
corporations, and for  middle and smaller corporations these are even greater 
burdens. Today there are  no reliable and continuous flowing price sources 
for softer currencies as there  are for hard currencies. Even the larger soft 
currencies like the Real or Rupee  are quoted only 3 to 4 times a day on 
Reuters, and the only spot quotes are  available from traders who are 
motivated to benefit from a large spread. The  GlobalCashExchange will allow 
buyers to transact at the middle of the interbank  spread. There are lots of 
Internet based foreign exchanges, and none that I have  actually seen support 
buyer to buyer transactions.

GlobalCashExchange will develop an Internet based exchange for foreign  
exchange, short term cash and credit. The goal is to reduce costs of such  
transactions. Global Cash Exchange can also greatly enhance capital 
formation  and the formation of local capital markets in developing 
countries. This is a  large and complex undertaking where we will need to be 
partnering with one or a  group of major financial institutions like 
Citibank, Cantor Fitzgerald, State  Street Bank, Schwab and the World Bank. 

As you know, the Foreign Exchange (FX) market is the largest and most  
participated financial market in the world with over $1.5 trillion exchanges  
daily throughout the world. There is no central market place for FX  
transactions: all FX transactions are conducted through a network of banks,  
dealers and brokers. Approximately 2/3 of FX transactions involve banks 
dealing  directly with each other. The potential market for short term cash 
and credit  --which will ultimately reduce the need for foreign exchange 
transactions -- is  even larger.

We are funding this internally and are starting to develop outside investor  
support. We have established great partnerships with organizations such as  
Standard & Poor's and Medley Global Advisors  (http://www.medleyadvisors.com
), for ratings and content on the site, VMAC (a  division of FSA that has 
patented the concept of providing pooled credit  enhancement facilities 
http://www.fsa.com), for revolving credit enhancement  facilities and 
Gen3Partners (http://www.gen3partners.com), for strategic and  technological 
advice. Transactions that cannot be matched can be cleared through  
Deerhurst, a leading foreign exchange fund manager who has agreed to provide  
liquidity from day one. We also know that we can purchase insurance for 
around  $7 billion of annual transactions for just under $1M a year. GCX is 
now at a  point that it has answered most of the questions that we had. We 
have a  commitment from Ashton Technologies for full build out of SEC 
approved  technology in exchange for equity. This technology has been used 
successfully  for more complex securities transactions and allows for many 
equity market  facilities that Forex markets do not currently have such as 
reserve book, limit  order and so forth. A description of the Ashton 
technology and an executive  summary that we use for our corporate clients 
are attached. 

We have good corporate support through World Research Advisory (WRA), an  
affiliated provider of research for corporate treasurers. WRA supplies 
Gartner  and Forrester type subscription research and advisory services to 
global 2000  companies. The contact list includes the CFO's of the following 
companies, many  of whom have agreed to participate in the Global Cash 
Exchange:
 

ALCOA  
ALLSTATE INSURANCE COMPANY  
AT&T  
BELLSOUTH CORPORATION  
CHUBB CORPORATION  
CNF TRANSPORTATION, INC.  
COMPAQ

I have scheduled a meeting with Larry Adams, the Asst. U.S. Attorney, and 
Doug Kornreich, the Corps lawyer, for Wednesday at 10:30 AM.  Doug tells me 
that VEPCO has told him that it plans to file a challenge to the GAO's 
decision in the Court of Federal Claims this week.  I have also spoken to 
Andy Holloman;  we will call him from the Venable office for a "download" on 
the Colorado case.

Ideas on D.C. counsel?  V&E or Venable are the logical choices;  offhand I 
would propose V&E.

I forgot to email myself the brief to track changes, but here are my changes 
in writing:

p. 1:  Para starting "focusing on the latter," that sentence, change "get 
creative" to be innavotaive in its approach."

p. 2:  1st full Paragraph, Second sentence, change "uniting" to "common" and 
there is a typo on line5, reduction n consumption.   Should be "of"

page 6:  We need the RR for PG&E.

Under Part VII, Rate Design, can we insert a sentence that our proposal, 
unlike the others, does not arbitrarily allocate costs to peak period.  We 
told Scott we wuold insert the arbitrariness of other proposals several times 
in the brief.

We also need ro insert discussion about relation of peak to offpeak prices, 
as a 3:2 ratio, which is not what other parties have proposed.

page 8:  2.  Derivation of Threshold Usage:, first sentence, delete "between" 
in first sentence.

page 9:  Second full paragraph, begining "Again, the UDS's, "  Second 
sentence, sited should be "cited"

p. 12:  First full paragraph beginning "A primary component,"  Insert a 
sentence after the second sentence to mention, again, the arbitrariness of 
proposals allocatin costs between peak and offpeak.

 Second full parag, beginning, "Enron's proposal, can stick a sentence about 
arbitrariness in there too.  And change "more necessary goal" in 4th sentence 
to "more critical goal"

I don't have the email I sent out about what we agreed to insert with Scott, 
so if you have a chance, check it to make sure we did everything we agreed to.

I am going to try to come into the office very early tomorrow and will check 
email again, but my son has an appointment with the neurologist here in 
Houston at 9:20 am tomorrow, and that is where I will be when you have the 
9:30 call (we made this appointment months ago).  But I will communicate with 
Harry and everyone else before then.  Thanks.

Steve,


I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  If 
you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.









As far as recommendations, here is a short list:

 1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales 
above monthly index without enough consideration of future 
      replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be 
injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.
                    This creates a shortage in later months.

 2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet 
demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.  
                      Specific questions should include:  

  1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order 
to fill storage?

  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too 
much gas from Socal's system.  
       I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their 
own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than 
their injection capablity, but injected far less.

 3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short 
term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major 
                    LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating 
rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market 
and the 
     consumer has benefitted.  


Call me if you need any more input.


Phillip

As a follow up to your  email I spoke to Janet Butler again about the ability 
to view FERC meetings.  Jan told me that the password is not tied to one 
location.  The password works for all locations.  A location equals a 
person/user.  The only requirement is to have Real Video access which Jan 
informs me is on the ENA Lan.  My understanding from Jan Butler is that the 
cost is $90 per user/location per month.

I will send the request to Jan to add two users/locations per your request.  
Jan will need names for the locations.  Do you want the locations to be in 
your name and Steve's or how do you want to set that up.

Subject: Re: FERC Meetings  

Eric - A couple of questions:

- Is the subscription dedicated to a particular user name, or is it something 
like a membership number? It would be helpful to be able to be able to watch 
the big meetings on one of the plasma screens, which would work with either 
login method.  If the subscription is tied to a membership number we could 
use any machine as the projecting machine.
- Is Real Video part of the Enron standard offering, special software that 
we'd need to order, or a freebie we can download like RealPlayer?

Thanks!

Mr. Kean - 

Per your request, I spoke to Janet Butler yesterday after the FERC meeting on 
options available to our group to view FERC meetings.  Janet told me that 
Shelley's group has an annual contract with Capitol Connection that costs 
$500 plus $90 for every additional connection annually.  The contract is 
being renewed in the next week.  Janet indicated that Shelley's group pays 
the charges and bills to our cost center.

Capitol Connection allows access to all other FERC meetings, such as the 
California Wholesale Conference.   We need to have Real Video access in order 
to view the meetings.

Eric

Subject: ACTION ALERT -- ELECTRONIC MONITORING


URGENT ACTION REQUESTED

On Thursday, September 14, the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the House
Committee on the Judiciary is slated to consider H.R. 4908, the Notice of
Electronic Monitoring Act.  H.R. 4908 is sponsored by Subcommittee Chairman
Charles Canady (R-FL-12) and cosponsored by subcommittee member Bob Barr
(R-GA-7).  The bill would require employers to notify employees about
electronic monitoring.  The National Association of Manufacturers urges its
members to notify their employees about internal monitoring practices.
Nevertheless, H.R. 4908 is being placed on a fast track that could allow for
many unintended consequences.  The NAM urges you to contact the Subcommittee
on the Constitution at (202) 226-7680 and subcommittee members (see below)
to urge postponement.

Message:

The September 6 hearing on H.R. 4908 was not well advertised and did not
include the views and concerns of employers.

Because of the nature of computers and other electronic equipment, any
"electronic monitoring" bill has to be carefully written so that it does not
interfere with other fiduciary and legal responsibilities of employers.

This is far too important an issue to "rush through" the process.

For more information, call Larry Fineran at (202) 637-3174 or e-mail him at
lfineran@nam.org.

Charles Canady (R-FL-12), Chair -- (202) 225-1252
Henry Hyde (R-IL-6) -- (202) 225-4561

Looks fine as far as it goes ... but don't we want to explain how this fits 
in to our strategy?  Is it just another platform for us to bring our products 
and prices to the market?  We have said with respect to EOL that the 
transaction is the goal not the platform.  Do we want to position this the 
same way?  Examples of other press releases include our extension of pricing 
on EOL to the two other platforms (including Houston Street) which we did a 
couple of months ago.

It's alittle early to be talking about Phil's birhtday but I have had some
conversations with him about replacing his PC with a more modern one that I
will build for him.  I want to know if you want to go in with me. He'll get
the PC in the near future but I don't expect anyone to contribute until his
birthday.

Here's the way it would work: we give Phil a new PC, I send an old Compaq of
ours to Kathy and Alan Wedig, Phil sends his old PC to some friends of mine
who live in Duluth, MN.  That means that our entire family will be
connected.

If not, I would send the Old Compaq to Phil otherwise and then he could send
his old one to Kathy and Alan.  The only problem with this scenario is that
Phil's old PC is getting a little too old.  Our friends in Duluth wouldn't
mind getting an old PC because they've never owned one.  I thought that Phil
would benefit the most from getting a brand new PC.  The old Compaq is will
still be okay for a while and Kathy should be fine with it.

What do you guys think?  If i do this right, Kathy would have a PC for her
birhtday in March.

Rob

I'm so glad that our guy, Grey Davis, was elected so that he can un-do what
little advancement was made in that horrible idea of letting markets work.

IssueAlert for  February 28, 2001=20

Constellation to Build Major Plant in California,=20
First in Over a Decade

by Will McNamara=20
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

Constellation Energy Group (NYSE: CEG) announced that Kiewit Industrial=20
Company of Omaha, Neb., will begin construction in early April of the 750-M=
W=20
High Desert power plant near Victorville, Calif. The project, which has bee=
n=20
in development since the mid-1990s by High Desert Power Project, LLC=01*a=
=20
subsidiary of Constellation Energy Group of Baltimore, Md.=01*will be the f=
irst=20
new major power plant to serve the Southern California area in more than a=
=20
decade.=20

Analysis: The fact that California suffers from a significant supply / dema=
nd=20
imbalance, and that no new major power plant has been built in the state in=
=20
over a decade, has been well documented in the energy industry press.=20
Consequently, the fact that Constellation Energy Group is now close to=20
breaking ground on its new plant (having completed the laborious plant siti=
ng=20
requirements in California) is a major=01*and somewhat surprising=01*coup f=
or the=20
company, considering that its generation expertise has primarily been in th=
e=20
Northeast nuclear industry. Constellation Energy Group has said that it wil=
l=20
market power from the plant within California, which should prove to be a w=
in=20
/ win scenario for both the company and the state.=20

The High Desert power plant will be built on a 25-acre site at the Southern=
=20
California Logistics Airport, formerly known as the George Air Force Base.=
=20
Commercial operation of the plant is scheduled for June 2003. The plant's=
=20
electric generating technology is based on clean-burning, natural gas-fired=
=20
combustion turbines operating in a combined-cycle mode. Part of the current=
=20
supply problem in California is the fact that hydroelectric resources, the=
=20
state's primary energy source, have been in short supply due to=20
lower-than-average rainfall over the last year. Moving away from a dependen=
cy=20
on hydroelectric supply may be a smart move for the state. In addition, the=
=20
High Desert plant is consistent with a national trend that supports natural=
=20
gas as the fuel of choice for new power plant development projects. As a=20
point of interest, according to data from the Energy Information=20
Administration, California's fuel mix is primarily based in a mixture of=20
natural gas (45.59 percent), hydro (21.95 percent), nuclear (18.07 percent)=
,=20
coal (1.36 percent), oil (1.04 percent), and other, presumably renewable,=
=20
sources (11.98 percent).=20

It is rather surprising that Constellation would be the first company to=20
build a major power plant in California in over a decade, considering the=
=20
company's consistent geographic and fuel-mix focus. Constellation Energy=20
Group is a holding company that includes a group of competitive energy=20
businesses focused mostly on wholesale power marketing, merchant generation=
=20
and portfolio management in North America. Constellation Energy Group is th=
e=20
parent company of the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BGE), a regulated=
=20
gas and electric delivery company serving Central Maryland. Up until this=
=20
point, Constellation's generation assets have been primarily based in a=20
mixture of coal and nuclear, and for the most part located in the=20
Northeastern United States. According to information directly from the=20
company itself, Constellation's own fuel mix is predominantly coal (54=20
percent), followed by nuclear (40 percent). Oil, gas and hydro only represe=
nt=20
a small percentage (6 percent) of Constellation's fuel mix.=20

Although coal is the primary fuel in Constellation's portfolio, over the la=
st=20
year the company has become more focused on nuclear. For instance, last=20
December Constellation Nuclear, a wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation=
=20
Energy Group, announced its intent to purchase 100 percent of Unit 1 and 82=
=20
percent of Unit 2 of the Nine Mile Point nuclear power plant. Once the deal=
=20
is closed in mid-2001, Constellation will own a total of 1,550 MW of Nine=
=20
Mile Point's 1,757 MW of total generating capacity. The nuclear plant=20
purchases that Constellation is making expand upon its Calvert Cliffs asset=
,=20
an 850-MW two-unit nuclear plant in Southern Maryland. When I wrote about=
=20
this acquisition last December, I noted that, while Constellation will most=
=20
likely retain its coal-fired generation assets, the company appeared to be=
=20
moving closer toward a nuclear-based portfolio.=20

In addition, in early 2000 Constellation began a restructuring of its=20
corporate identity, dividing its operations into two separate segments: one=
=20
focused on its merchant energy business (including Constellation Nuclear) a=
nd=20
the other focused on regional retail energy services. The merchant energy=
=20
business was ranked fifth in the nation for sales of electric power in the=
=20
third quarter of 2000, and the company is committed to expanding this growt=
h.=20
The goal for the merchant energy business, according to Constellation Energ=
y=20
Group CEO Christian Poindexter, is to establish a portfolio of over 30,000 =
MW=20
of electric generation facilities by 2005. Toward that end, Constellation=
=20
acknowledged earlier that it would be taking advantage of "bargain prices f=
or=20
nuclear plants," which resulted in large part from other utilities focusing=
=20
on transmission operations and thus choosing, or being mandated, to divest=
=20
their generation plants.  Constellation in the past has justified its move =
in=20
this direction by saying that its experience has found that nuclear fuel is=
=20
cheaper than coal and gas generators and that "the economics [of nuclear] a=
re=20
quite robust, once they are calculated out." =20

However, considering that there is only a limited number of nuclear plants =
in=20
the United States that will become available for purchase, Constellation=20
Energy Group may have recognized the need to become even more diversified.=
=20
The California market, despite its stringent plant siting requirements,=20
arguably offered an appropriate market for Constellation to become more=20
diversified. Given the state's environmental lobbying presence, it is=20
doubtful that a nuclear plant could have been approved in California.=20
Although natural gas is not a primary fuel source for Constellation as a=20
company, it is the preferred source for new power plants. Therefore, the Hi=
gh=20
Desert plant, given that it will be fired by natural gas, presumably stood =
a=20
greater chance of navigating through California's plant siting requirements=
=20
(than a coal or nuclear plant could have). In fact, in the announcement of=
=20
the plant, Constellation noted that, having received all federal, state and=
=20
local approvals, the High Desert plant "will be a good neighbor in the=20
community with no significant environmental impacts."=20

The announcement of Constellation's new plant could not come at a better ti=
me=20
for California, of course. Although the plant won't be operational until Ju=
ne=20
2003, the state can use the good publicity now. A new report from the=20
Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA) says that it is already too lat=
e=20
for the state to head off a serious summer shortage that could lead to at=
=20
least 20 hours of rolling blackouts. "It's too late for this summer,"=20
declared Lawrence J. Makovich, of CERA, referring to the state's desperate=
=20
efforts to ramp up power supplies for the short term. "The source of=20
California's far-reaching power crisis is a shortage. At least 5,000=20
megawatts of new generating facilities are required to restore balance to t=
he=20
state's grid." Instead, according to the report, demand will exceed supply =
by=20
3,000 MW, which will cause the state to be under an energy alert of some so=
rt=20
for at least 200 hours.=20

CERA's report came out on the heels of Calif. Gov. Gray Davis' pledge to ha=
ve=20
5,000 MW of new generating capacity available in California by July, more=
=20
than double the amount expected just a few months ago. Davis said the new=
=20
plants would provide enough electricity to ward off blackouts this summer,=
=20
which CERA obviously disputes. Davis announced a series of orders intended =
to=20
bring online 5,000 MW by July 2001, with an additional 5,000 MW by July=20
2002. =20

In any event, as California continues to struggle from a severe supply /=20
demand imbalance, the announcement of Constellation's new plant appears to =
be=20
good news for all the parties involved. Gov. Davis has pledged to support a=
n=20
expedited approval process for additional plants, so it will be interesting=
=20
to see which company is given approval to proceed with the next power plant=
=20
in the state. It will also be interesting to see, based on Constellation's=

plant and others that may be built, whether or not the economics of buildin=
g=20
such plants in California will prove beneficial. Other power suppliers may=

Steve -

I enjoyed our meeting last Monday and we are hard at work on a different
proposal designed to speed up or progress to the top ranks of the world's
best business schools. As you pointed out this is in our mutual interest as
well as the interests of much of the Houston business community.

I mentioned in our meeting the possibility of your joining the Council of
Overseers of the Jones School. This group consists of about 36 business
leaders, mostly from Houston but also includes individuals from as far away
as Saudi Arabia.

We meet about two times a year for an afternoon to discuss important policy
issues facing the Business School. I have found the advice and counsel
offered by the group to be extraordinarily helpful as we work on improving
the Jones School. The group is chaired by Dennis Hendrix, former CEO of
PanEnergy. I will fax you a list of the members and the charter of the group.

It so happens that we will be meeting next Wednesday afternoon from three
to five PM at Cohen House, the faculty club at Rice University and you
would be welcome to attend either as a new member or as a guest.
Interestingly, a presentation will be given by a group of faculty who have
interests in the area of e-commerce.

I will have my assistant fax this material to you shortly. Should you wish
to discuss this, I will be here all afternoon today as well as all of next
week.

Houston has experienced catastrophic flooding. My flight has been cancelled.  
It is conceivable that I could get out tomorrow, but I am wondering if I 
should try.  I could still make the speech if we don't get more rain, but 
given the lack of other reasons for me to go, I am considering cancelling.  I 
don't think it makes much sense for me to go for a 15 minute speech.  
what do you think?

I think this is a very interesting idea.  Please get with Bill D. and make 
sure he gets a description of what we would need to do to physically 
accomodate the station and make sure he's comfortable with it before we go 
ahead.

As part of our agreement with the Channel 2 WeatherNet program we were given 
the option to have a weather station at the Enron building. This would be an 
additional $5,000 on top of our commitment. I brought the idea to Gary Taylor 
and Todd Kimberlain in weather and they thought it would be a great idea to 
serve as the weather tracking spot in downtown Houston. They have agreed to 
pay the $5K for the equipment and installation. So now, in addition to 
Channel 2 mentioning "WetherNet, brought to you by Enron," everytime they 
talk about the weather in downtown Houston, they will mention the current 
temp. at the Enron building.

If you have any questions, please call me at ext. 34535.

Interesting timing for your question.  My take, after discussions with Terry, 
was that she was brought on to handle the environmental side of sustainable 
development, but that Palmisano was utilizing her for greenhouse gas related 
issues since not much had occurred on the other front yet.  Burt Mike and I 
learned last week that she actually reports to Palmisano--he is the one who 
took her from consultant to employee status.  I spoke with John on Friday and 
told him that I wasn't going to poach her now that I knew where she fit in 
the scheme of things.  

This actually solves a dilemma for me anyway.  As you know, I need a more 
senior environmental person with good high level relationships with NGOs and 
I didn't want her to feel slighted when I found someone.  Moreover, she has 
just advised us that she and her husband are moving to San Francisco and 
wants to telecommute.  This should work fine for John but I feel it is 
important for my person to be in DC or NY.

Is Catherine working on environmental policy related to sustainability or is 
she working on greenhouse gas transactions . . . or both?

You do not need to real Catherine McKalip-Thompson's full trip report from 
her European venture, but you did express some surprise that on her trip to 
Europe she went beyond policy and discussed "busienss" or commercial 
activities, as I recall our conversation.  her note below makes clear, to me, 
that partnerships and investments were discussed with, inter alia, a Dutch 
distribution company, Credit Lyonnais, and CGU (an insurer).  Just FYI.   mcs

John,

Attached is my trip report for Amsterdam, Paris and London - I've given the 
contact information for everyone to Kathy to be entered in the database and 
thank you notes are going out today.  

The company meetings did not go quite as well as I might have hoped (Edon was 
not so interested), but we need to discuss further the potential relationship 
with Credit Lyonnais' effort to develop the "gap financing" fund.UNEP 
conference not as billed but some contacts there such as Credit Suisse First 
Boston and Gerling's Sustainable Development Company were useful as both are 
quite interested in climate change business opportunities.  Also it provided 
a chance to gather interesting updated info on current financial-sustainable 
development metrics, links, funds, firms, etc.  Discussions with participants 
in the UK Emissions Trading group were interesting and I now have several 
working papers on this effort which I can distribute to anyone who is 
interested (though Mark's group probably has them already but I'll check with 
them directly on that). I did not get the chance to meet up with Nicola Steen.

Catherine

Rick: During the early performance review, Germain Palmer had been placed in 
the satisfactory classification because of the need to reach the goals now 
not being applied by our division. Germain is definately a "strong" and 
rising employee in this office and I would like to recommend his rating as 
"strong."

Germain has been a God send this summer and we all greatly value his 
contribution in Washington.

Thank you for your consideration of this request.

Melissa,
I sent Jean and draft agenda and workplan framework onthe 28th, and so she'll 
probably want to send out some additional meeting information once we have 
the date/time confirmed.  But in the interests of scheduling the meeting with 
everyone's busy schedules, I appreciate you starting the process with next 
Friday March 9th before 1pm or so (to accommodate Mark in London).  

The following people are on the subcommittee and should be invited:  
Steve Barth, EBS
Steve Kean, Enron Corp
Jimmy Mogal, Enron India
Miguel Padron, Enron South America
Mark Schroeder Enron Europe

Thanks! Call me if you need anything further.  I think I will be in Houston 
next Wed- Friday (but possibly may be here Tuesday also).

Michael Tribolet held a conference call this evening to discuss Enron Wind's 
legal obligations given SCE's non-payment.  In general, given the legal 
structure of Enron Wind, some action may be required from a partnership 
perspective.

The key next step is action on SB47 - Interim Short-Term Avoided Cost 
Methodology.  Enron Wind is unlikely to take any action if real progress is 
made by this Friday.  If not, a different action plan will occur.   This may 
change if other renewable QFs sue (for instance FP&L - who has retained 
counsel but don't want to be the first to take action).

They will begin to draft some pleadings to prepare for legal action (in case 
this is necessary).  

Michael Tribolet is on point to hear if EWC takes any action and we should be 
apprised before they move.

F.Y.I.

                              
  California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Power Costs 
  By Rebecca Smith 
    
  09/01/2000 
  The Wall Street Journal 
  Page A4 
  (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

  California lawmakers voted to extend modest relief to San Diego residents 
burdened with
  high electricity bills and set the groundwork for faster construction of 
badly needed power
  plants. They stopped short, however, of passing legislation that would roll 
back retail power
  rates to levels seen prior to deregulation .

  Late Wednesday, lawmakers sent a bill to Gov. Gray Davis that limits to 6.5 
cents per
  kilowatt hour the amount that small customers of San Diego Gas & Electric 
Co. can be
  charged. The utility is allowed to add power-delivery and other reasonable 
costs to that
  commodity price.

  The price, equivalent to a bulk power cost of $65 per megawatt hour, is far 
higher than the
  average price of power for 27 of the 31 months in which California's market 
has been
  deregulated. But in June and July, the average price of power obtained by 
the utility from a
  state-sanctioned energy auction rose to 12 cents and 10.5 cents, 
respectively, compared
  with the 2.3 cents and 2.8 cents charged in those months a year earlier.

  Passed directly through to customers,the resulting bills sparked a near 
mutiny. The
  rate-cap measure applies to residential and small commercial customers, as 
well as to
  schools and hospitals.

  In addition to the rate cap, which can be adjusted upward or downward by 
the California
  Public Utilities Commission until December 2002, the legislature earmarked 
$150 million of
  general-fund revenue, which can be used to subsidize San Diego power costs 
if they greatly
  exceed the 6.5-cents-per-kilowatt-hour rate. For now, the utility would be 
expected to make
  up any difference between revenue collected and the actual cost.

  Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, parent of San Diego Gas & Electric 
Co., said the
  rate-cap measure is "deeply flawed" because it limits the amount prices can 
rise but sets
  no floor. That means any shortfall could grow -- without a mechanism for 
customers to pay
  it down -- until the end of the rate-cap period, which could last until 
December 2002 or
  December 2003.

  Mr. Baum said Sempra stands to suffer an undercollection of perhaps $664 
million, provided
  future prices approximate the New York Mercantile Exchange forward prices 
through
  December 2002. "It's irreparably damaging to Sempra," he said because it 
"creates
  tremendous uncertainty" that makes it hard for the San Diego energy company 
to finance
  new projects such as a new transmission line.

  The legislature also appeared likely to approve a bill speeding up the 
permit process for the
  construction of new power plants, in part by beefing up staffs of 
regulatory agencies that
  review the plans.

becomes a big "government to government" issue?

Steve
 With regard to Dabhol, Tom Briggs and I have already provided a status 
briefing on the Dabhol situation to agencies across the government - 
including DoEnergy, DOCommerce,DOState and DOTreasury.  The briefing was with 
staff and brought them up to speed on where we stand.   As the new 
administration moves into the positions relevant to the situation we will 
brief them - all the way up to the cabinet officals.  I understand that Colin 
Powell has already been briefed on the situation  and I know the Ambasssador 
has been front and center on the issue.
 If we were to move into a crisis mode, we will need to brief senior officals 
of the new administration at each of the  above agencies as well as the VP's 
office.  Given their interest I think we will be able to do that quickly.
 We have also briefed OPIC and EXIM about the situation - they are 
comfortable at this point.
 I am also getting the World Bank re-engaged to the extent that it is helpful 
and not a problem.  They have resources that can help MSEB reform themselves 
if MSEB will view it has a help.  It is a sensitive issue because the Bank 
has historically been anti-Dabhol so I am taking it step by step.
 If you have any other questions just let me know.  thanks John

I'm still waiting for Davis' office to call.  The plan currently is for me to 
talk to him when and if he calls.  Sandi has been in touch with the 
governor's office.

By the way, thanks for the summary of the California proceedings.  I talked 
to Hebert yesterday and he was duly impressed with your remarks ... I had to 
remind him that you worked on the right answers for California, not the 
abomination that's in place today.

In the second paragraph we should delete the "partnership" statement.  I 
think it's more effective to refer to the New Power Company's risk management 
capabilities (as provided by Enron, if necessary).  That's the basis for the 
ability to guarantee savings (not economies of scale).  I am also concerned 
that the current statement implies that Enron is taking the risk on the 
commodity price guarantees.

Attached is the first draft of an announcement that we're targeting for 
release before market opening on Monday, August 28th.
It announces our entry into the New Jersey and Pennsylvania markets (and 
guess what, we're already beginning to sign up customers as of yesterday!).
We'd put it out on PR Newswire (nationally) as well as to all the key 
industry trades.

Please feel free to pass it along for comments to the usual crew at Enron.

Thanks!

Kathy

  Business; Financial Desk 
  State's Power Grid Again Pushed to Brink of Rolling Blackouts Energy: High
  temperatures, generator shutdowns push usage within 5% of capacity. Heat 
wave is
  expected to continue today. 
  NANCY RIVERA BROOKS 
    
  09/19/2000 
  Los Angeles Times 
  Home Edition

  Sweltering weather across California pushed the state's heat-stressed 
electricity grid close
  to meltdown Monday, and state power officials urged electricity 
conservation because today
  and Wednesday could be even worse.

  Power was cut to hundreds of large business customers and about 125,000 
residential and
  business air-conditioner and agricultural pumping customers Monday after 
the California
  Independent System Operator, which runs the electricity grid for about 75% 
of the state,
  declared a Stage 2 power emergency. At Stage 2, when the grid is using more 
than 95% of
  available power, the state's big investor-owned utilities are asked to 
interrupt power to
  customers that have agreed to this voluntary action in exchange for 
discounted rates.

  Grid reliability was threatened when two electricity units in Northern 
California stopped
  working for a time as heavy air-conditioner demand began to push power use 
higher,
  Cal-ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle said.

  Demand peaked at about 42,000 megawatts on the Cal-ISO grid, but the two 
unidentified
  units, representing about 320 megawatts of generation, were returned to 
service in the
  afternoon--in time to help keep the state from reaching its first Stage 3, 
which would lead to
  neighborhood blackouts.

  "We were right on the edge of warning about a possible Stage 3," McCorkle 
said. "A couple
  of generators fell offline in late morning, and that kind of gave everybody 
a scare."

  A Stage 3 emergency would be declared if power reserves fall below 1.5%--in 
essence,
  when the electricity grid is using more than 98.5% of available power--and 
rotating outages
  of nonessential customers for an hour or longer would become likely to keep 
the grid from
  failing. That would result in widespread blackouts lasting several hours.

  Electricity use was also high in the area served by the Los Angeles 
Department of Water
  and Power, peaking near 4,750 megawatts Monday. But DWP customers were not
  threatened by power interruptions or rolling blackouts because the 
municipal utility has
  more than enough generating capacity to meet demand.

  "We're doing OK as we have all summer long," said DWP General Manager S. 
David
  Freeman.

  Cal-ISO asked Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric and San 
Diego Gas &
  Electric to call on all of their interruptible-power customers to 
immediately stop using
  electricity, representing a potential 3,000 megawatts, or roughly the 
amount of electricity
  used by 3 million homes.

  Thousands of students at College of the Canyons in Valencia experienced the 
California
  equivalent of a snow day Monday when power outage alarms rang about 1:30 
p.m, the
  seventh time this year, college spokesman Sue Bozman said. If the college 
doesn't pull the
  plug, it pays a big fine.

  "For several years, we saved $100,000 a year by being on this 
interruptible-service plan,"
  said Bozman, who with other administrators finished the work day with 
mobile phones and
  portable computers. "But when the alarm rings and we decline to turn off 
our power, it's a
  whole different ballgame."

  One such day in May, during final exams, the college didn't cut power and 
penalties totaled
  $30,000, she said.

  During the height of Monday's power crisis, PG&E--whose territory suffered 
local blackouts
  on June 14 in a similar reliability emergency--kept an open telephone line 
to Cal-ISO for
  minute-by-minute updates, spokesman Ron Low said.

  SCE and the other utilities begged customers to use as little electricity 
as possible, and
  grocery stores around the state voluntarily reduced lighting and other 
power use to comply.

  "We're issuing a call to action, a call that everyone needs to take 
seriously," Pam Bass,
  SCE's senior vice president for customer service, said in a statement as 
electricity use
  soared Monday. "If the demand for power does not decrease soon, we will be 
directed by
  the state to begin shutting off power for blocks of customers. Everyone 
needs to cut their
  use of power now to avoid forced outages."

  Today and Wednesday could be even more challenging: Cal-ISO is predicting 
peak use of
  44,827 megawatts for today. Peak demand was expected to be 44,537 megawatts 
on
  Monday, but conservation and power-interruption programs kept the total 
lower.

  "We are anticipating tomorrow to be a good deal like today," SCE 
spokeswoman Karen
  Shepard-Grimes said Monday. Electricity demand in SCE territory peaked at 
17,860
  megawatts before the Rosemead-based utility asked power customers to cut 
2,500
  megawatts of electricity. "It got really touchy today," she said.

Dear Steven,

You have very kindly directed us in the right direction before.

Derek (Goodwin) has asked me to contact you. Derek is organizing a UK
Technology Forum on behalf of the Houston British Consulate General &
Invest.UK offices to be held in Houston in March. The purpose of which is to
foster & strengthen links between the technology-driven communities of
Houston & the UK. BT will showcase the leading-edge technology
infrastructure in the UK and a British Consulate General/Invest.UK speaker
will outline of the resources available to facilitate business expansion to
the UK.

The Forum will take the form of a breakfast & include the welcome &
introduction of a keynote speaker and a panel of 3 other speakers from
Houston based technology companies that have set-up an operation in the UK.
The panelists will give a brief overview of the why's & wherefor's behind
their decision to locate in the UK. The Forum will conclude with a moderated
Q&A session.

As Houston is a fast growing high-tech city, especially in the energy
sector, Derek has asked if you can refer him to the right person within
Enron with whom he can speak regarding Enron's possible involvement in the
Forum.

We'd appreciate any help you can give.

Sincerely,

Brian Medd-Sygrove
Vice Consul (Investment)
Invest.UK

Isn't our primary problem with AEP's internal merchant function rather than 
with the marketing affiliate (I realize we have problems with the affiliate 
too)?  Can we protest continued market based rate authority for AEP until 
they have surrendered native load priority?

On 9/21, EPMI filed a protest (Below) against AEP/CSW's 3 year update request 
to continue market based rates for power marketing.  The filing includes 
examples of discriminatory behavior on OASIS (for ATCs, etc.) that 
potentially benefitted AEP's marketing side. 

EPMI has already protested Entergy's request for continuation of MBRs earlier 
this year, and plans to protest other large utility-based power marketer MBR 
filings this fall.  Let me know if you would like the list.  Thanks.

State might balk on power: But refusing to pay 'ridiculous' prices could ad=
d=20
to crisis.
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published April 20, 2001)=20
Adding to the risk of summertime blackouts, the state water department said=
=20
Thursday it might not pay "ridiculous" prices for electricity even if that=
=20
leaves California short of power.=20
The Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for th=
e=20
state's two beleaguered utilities since mid-January, wouldn't spell out wha=
t=20
it considers ridiculous. But if prices get too high, the state might be=20
better off ordering blackouts or implementing proposed new conservation=20
programs designed at cutting usage on short notice, said Raymond Hart, the=
=20
department's deputy director in charge of power purchases.=20
Gov. Gray Davis took a different view, saying: "We will continue to keep th=
e=20
lights on. When you're fighting a forest fire, you don't say, 'Let me see,=
=20
how much is this going to cost me? Maybe I can't write the check, maybe I=
=20
can't put the fire out.' You put the fire out and then worry about the cost=
=20
later."=20
But Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, said the Governor's Office indeed is=
=20
contemplating whether to refuse to buy power at any cost. "At what point do=
es=20
the state say, 'Enough is enough'? Those scenarios are certainly under=20
discussion," Maviglio said.=20
The water department until recently resisted buying all the power Southern=
=20
California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. needed, refusing to=20
purchase electricity it deemed too costly. But lately it's had to relax tha=
t=20
stance because of an order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Har=
t=20
said.=20
That April 6 order said power generators can no longer be forced to sell=20
electricity to uncreditworthy entities such as the Independent System=20
Operator, which manages the state's power grid. Because the ISO -- which ge=
ts=20
its money from the utilities -- can no longer buy the power, the water=20
department is now buying all the electricity required by the utilities, Har=
t=20
said. But he said the department could back off if prices get out of hand.=
=20
"If the prices just get ridiculous altogether, there's a policy call to be=
=20
made, and we'll cross that bridge when we get there," Hart said.=20
The ISO has predicted that severe shortages could bring 34 days of rolling=
=20
blackouts this summer. The potential refusal of the water department to buy=
=20
ultra-expensive power could further strain the grid.=20
"On a daily basis we're dealt a set of cards," said ISO spokesman Patrick=
=20
Dorinson. "It sounds like ... we're going to be handed another set of cards=
,=20
and we're going to have to try to maintain the reliability of the grid as=
=20
best we can."=20
Hart's comments came amid an increasingly rancorous debate between Davis an=
d=20
PG&E over the water department's power expenditures. State spending shot up=
=20
following PG&E's April 6 filing for bankruptcy protection.=20
Davis said generators began demanding a "credit penalty" from the water=20
department because of the PG&E bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, the=20
state's daily costs shot up last week to $73.2 million from $57.4 million i=
n=20
the week before PG&E went bankrupt, the governor's office said.=20
Hart agreed, saying several generators raised their prices. "Every time=20
there's a major hiccup in the market, such as PG&E bankruptcy or a staged=
=20
alert by the ISO, there's a price run-up," Hart said.=20
But prices have settled down this week. After peaking at $345 a megawatt ho=
ur=20
April 12, prices for north state power were at $243 on Thursday, just below=
=20
what they were prior to the bankruptcy filing, according to the Enerfax new=
s=20
service.=20
PG&E, however, said its bankruptcy filing had nothing to do with the state'=
s=20
increased spending.=20
"This claim is simply not accurate," the utility said in a memo to reporter=
s.=20
Rather, the increased spending is due solely to the fact that the water=20
department is buying more units of electricity in the wake of the FERC orde=
r,=20
PG&E said.=20
Regardless of the cause, the increased spending by the water department cou=
ld=20
further strain the state's budget -- and complicate Davis' plan to finance=
=20
the power purchases through a bond offering.=20
The state has committed $5.2 billion from its general fund for power=20
purchases since January. Those mounting purchases, along with PG&E's=20
bankruptcy filing and other energy crisis uncertainties, prompted a third=
=20
Wall Street credit rating agency, Fitch, to place the state on a "ratings=
=20
watch" this week, meaning the rating might be downgraded.=20
A downgrade could raise California's borrowing costs. All three of the=20
leading Wall Street credit agencies now have California on a ratings watch.=
=20
Meanwhile, the state Public Utilities Commission on Thursday ordered an=20
investigation of why hundreds of cogenerators and other alternative energy=
=20
providers haven't resumed production even though they've begun receiving=20
payments again from Edison and PG&E.=20
These generators, under contract to the utilities, provide more than 20=20
percent of the state's energy supply. Hundreds shut down, worsening=20
California's power situation, because they'd received little or no money fr=

the utilities since November.=20
The PUC ordered Edison and PG&E to resume payments, starting this week, for=

SMUD directors vote to hike rates: A tentative increase of 19% to 27% is=20
blamed on rising energy costs.
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
(Published April 20, 2001)=20
Ten years of stable electricity bills vanished in a single unanimous vote=
=20
Thursday night as directors of Sacramento Municipal Utility District gave=
=20
tentative approval to rate hikes ranging from 19 percent to 27 percent.=20
The new rates will go into effect immediately after a final vote, scheduled=
=20
for May 3.=20
"This is quite alarming to all of us," said director Peter Keat. But praisi=
ng=20
the value of "a community-owned electric company" that provides everything=
=20
from shade trees to public votes on rates, Keat said he saw no choice.=20
SMUD, which once hoped to lower electric bills this year or next as=20
deregulation took hold, was caught up in the spiraling wholesale costs that=
=20
helped send Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy proceedings.=20
The price of natural gas, which fuels SMUD's cogeneration plants, has risen=
=20
steeply.=20
Wholesale electricity, which SMUD buys to supplement power produced by its=
=20
own plants, nearly tripled between October and January.=20
And the weather has been dismal. Rainfall and snowmelt that feed SMUD's=20
hydroelectric plants on the upper American River are about 53 percent of=20
normal to date.=20
But during a two-hour hearing, a small contingent of consumers asked the=20
board to reconsider.=20
"I realize that rates have to go up, but this seems like a big percentage a=
ll=20
at once," said Marian Ender.=20
Several criticized a 6 percent surcharge that until only a few days before=
=20
had been proposed at 3 percent. Among them was Duy Tu, an engineering manag=
er=20
at Intel who served on SMUD's advisory rate committee.=20
The increase "cannot come at a worse time" for Intel, he said, although he=
=20
understands the need for it. He urged the board to act now to make more=20
electricity available in the future.=20
"We are way too dependent on some external force to keep the lights on," Tu=
=20
said.=20
Overall, a base rate increase averaging 16 percent will raise about $124=20
million annually for SMUD, and a special=20
6 percent surcharge will raise about $48 million in its first year. Most of=
=20
the surcharge, scheduled to drop to 3 percent annually for two subsequent=
=20
years, will go into an emergency fund.=20
"We have to build back our savings account. It's been gutted," said directo=
r=20
Susan Patterson.=20
The rate increases will fall most heavily on small commercial and large=20
industrial power users, although households with very low electricity bills=
=20
will feel a sharp bite from the addition of a $5 monthly service fee.=20
The flat fee adds less than 10 percent to what was a "typical" residential=
=20
SMUD bill of $67, but it's a 25 percent rate hike for someone whose monthly=
=20
bill hovers around $20.=20
"I just don't think that part is right," Ender said. "We should only pay fo=
r=20
usage."=20
Tom Reavey took the board to task for "unfair and unequitable" rates that=
=20
charge agriculture and small businesses less than what they cost SMUD to=20
serve, while charging homeowners and renters slightly more.=20
But board members defended going easier on rates for the pumps that run=20
farmers' wells and irrigation systems.=20
"We all gain great benefits from living in a community that has nearby=20
agriculture," Keat said.=20
The new rates will apply throughout SMUD's service territory, which include=
s=20
a narrow slice of southern Placer County and all but the southwestern tip o=
f=20
Sacramento County. They will not=20
affect people who receive electric service from PG&E, which last month was=
=20
granted a 29 percent hike by state regulators.=20
"If you want to see a bunch of folks who are really facing some stark times=
,=20
it's PG&E customers," said board member Howard Posner.=20
While there is widespread speculation that PG&E's rate hikes are the first =
of=20
many, Posner and other directors said they hoped Thursday's increases will =
be=20
the last SMUD needs and that rates could decline in three to four years.=20
To boost conservation, both SMUD and PG&E are trying to craft rates that fa=
ll=20
hardest on the heaviest household users.=20
SMUD's old residential rates were=20
divided into a baseline tier charged roughly 8 cents a kilowatt-hour in the=
=20
summer and one higher tier billed at 12.7 cents a kilowatt-hour.=20
The new rates will start at 8.6 cents in the summer, rise to a middle tier =
of=20
14.5 cents and top out at 16.2 cents for those who use more than 1,000=20
kilowatt-hours of electricity.=20
By comparison, PG&E has proposed to the state Public Utilities Commission=
=20
that its residential rates be divided into four tiers, topping out at 27=20
cents per kilowatt-hour. A PUC decision is expected next month.=20
Under the new SMUD rate structure, including the surcharge, large industrie=
s=20
will see their electric bills rise by an average of 27 percent, agricultura=

Households that qualify for special low-income or life-support rates will p=

Escondido calls a halt to power plant ideas=20



Temporary step will give it time for overall planning
By Jonathan Heller=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
April 19, 2001=20
ESCONDIDO -- After being inundated with proposals to build power plants in=
=20
the past few months, the City Council yesterday called a timeout.=20
The council voted 3-2 to suspend consideration for 30 to 60 days of any=20
proposals to build energy generating facilities in the city. During that=20
period, city staff members will develop a comprehensive approval process th=
at=20
will factor in the cumulative effects of such plants.=20
"We need to step back and look at the direction we're going in," City=20
Councilwoman June Rady said.=20


The city has been juggling four power-plant proposals since January:=20
?Sempra Energy Resources wants to build a 500-megawatt plant in the southwe=
st=20
part of Escondido. It has not yet filed formal plans with the city Planning=
=20
Department.=20
?Ramco Inc. of San Diego has received approval to build a 44-megawatt plant=

on Mission Avenue in west Escondido.=20
?CalPeak LLC of San Diego has filed plans to build a 49.5-megawatt plant on=
=20
Enterprise Street, not far from the Ramco plant.=20
?Another firm has expressed interest in building a 49.5-megawatt plant on=
=20
city property on West Washington Avenue, but has not submitted plans yet.=
=20
Yesterday's decision means that all the projects -- except the=20
already-approved Ramco plant -- are now on hold, and no new proposals can b=
e=20
filed with the city.=20
The decision halts a mad dash by developers to bring power plants on line b=
y=20
the summer to take advantage of special incentives offered by Gov. Gray=20
Davis.=20
Mayor Lori Holt Pfeiler and Councilwoman Marie Waldron opposed the move. Th=
ey=20
said it would only delay much-needed solutions to the region's energy crisi=
s,=20
which is expected to come to a head this summer.=20
"If (plant developers) have a chance of getting power on line by the summer=
,=20
we should not be the ones to stand in the way," Pfeiler said.=20
Waldron argued that cities have to be more proactive at this time, not less=
.=20
"The governor is not solving the problem," Waldron said. "It's up to local=
=20
governments to try to do what they can."=20
Joe Rowley, Sempra's project development director, said he doubted the=20
council's decision would upset his plans.=20
"Our timetable is still not fully defined," Rowley said. "Obviously there's=
 a=20
lot of work we have to do to get to the point where an application can be=
=20
processed."=20
Meanwhile, council members listened to two people who made impassioned plea=
s=20
for the city to consider alternative power sources.=20
David Drake, a service architect for SAIC in La Jolla, urged the council to=
=20
think about solar power. There is more than enough available land -- and=20
rooftop space -- to install enough solar panels to power the whole city, he=
=20
said.=20
"Escondido has 65 square miles," he said. "But 2,500 acres could be employe=
d=20
to power us forever without any reliance on imported energy."=20
Local inventor Arnold Lund urged the council to consider energy generated=
=20
from windmills.=20
The council also voted to work with San Marcos in exploring ways to seek=20
inexpensive, stable energy rates.=20
The hope is that the two cities can forge a deal with Sempra for cheaper=20
rates. Sempra officials have said they are willing to discuss possible rate=
=20
deals with the city.=20
To buy power directly, a city has to adopt a special legal arrangement, suc=

Inflated natural-gas prices add to energy costs, expert says=20



Windfall-profits tax gets Davis' backing
By Bill Ainsworth=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
April 19, 2001=20
SACRAMENTO -- Federal regulators' failure to stop what they described as=20
anti-competitive practices in the natural-gas industry added $750 million t=
o=20
Southern California Edison's cost of electricity, a consultant estimated=20
yesterday.=20
The consultant, Paul Carpenter of the Brattle Group, spoke to an Assembly=
=20
subcommittee investigating why California pays the highest natural-gas pric=
es=20
in the nation. Natural gas is a critical part of the electricity crisis=20
because most of the state's generating plants run on natural gas.=20
Natural-gas prices have soared throughout the nation, but the bench mark=20
price paid at California's border has been double that paid at other bench=
=20
mark locations throughout the nation for months, according to figures=20
released by the Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight.=20
Next week, Carpenter plans to testify at hearings in Washington, D.C., on=
=20
behalf of Southern California Edison and the California Public Utilities=20
Commission, which are asking federal regulators to intervene.=20
The giant utility and the state regulatory body contend that a sweetheart=
=20
deal between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy gave the siste=
r=20
companies enough market power to artificially raise the price of natural ga=
s=20
that flows into Southern California from Texas.=20
El Paso owns the major pipeline bringing natural gas from fields in New=20
Mexico and Texas to Southern California. El Paso Merchant Energy is an=20
unregulated sister company.=20
Carpenter called the prices paid in Southern California "simply=20
unprecedented" in the United States. He estimated that the sister companies=
=20
manipulated the market enough to add $2.60 to the price of a million Britis=
h=20
thermal units of gas.=20
In addition, he said, El Paso Merchant Energy owns part of 20 smaller power=
=20
plants, "qualifying facilities" that get paid based on the price of natural=
=20
gas in California. The higher natural-gas prices increase the company's=20
revenues, Carpenter said.=20
El Paso company officials are expected to testify in front of the Assembly=
=20
subcommittee today, but in proceedings before the federal regulators they=
=20
have denied any sweetheart deal.=20
In a report they commissioned, the company blamed the higher natural-gas=20
prices in Southern California on increased demand and constraints on pipeli=
ne=20
capacity.=20
Gov. Gray Davis, meanwhile, gave his strongest endorsement yet to a=20
windfall-profits tax on generators as a Senate committee chaired by Joseph=

Davis, Congress members call for energy price controls=20



By Gary Gentile
ASSOCIATED PRESS=20
April 19, 2001=20
LOS ANGELES =01) Gov. Gray Davis and a bipartisan group of the state's=20
congressional delegates agreed Thursday that the federal government must ac=
t=20
to control the wholesale price of energy.=20
"For us the big issue is how we address the unjust rates," said Rep. Mary=
=20
Bono, R-Palm Springs. "I believe we are up to it and will handle it as soon=
=20
as we can."=20
Davis met behind closed doors with 27 congressional representatives,=20
including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel ne=
ar=20
Los Angeles International Airport. He said after the 90-minute meeting that=
=20
the group discussed a threefold approach to the state's power crisis.=20
The strategy includes requiring federal agencies in the state, including=20
military facilities, to conserve energy this summer and asking the Federal=
=20
Energy Regulatory Commission to find a way to control the wholesale price o=
f=20
electricity and increase the flow of natural gas into California.=20
Davis repeated his criticism of federal regulators for not acting sooner to=
=20
control the wholesale price of electricity and said he was hopeful the=20
state's congressional delegation could work together to find a bipartisan=
=20
solution.=20
"We agreed there has to be a mechanism to reduce the wholesale price of=20
electricity," Davis said. "We have agreed to work cooperatively across part=
y=20
lines to find ways we can reduce those costs. We're in this together. Party=
=20
doesn't matter. Finding a solution does matters."=20
"To have the price of moving natural gas go up by a factor of 10 or more is=
=20
absurd," said Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Los Angeles. "So many of our colleagues=
=20
are telling us it's California's fault, but California does not have the=20
authority to regulate these two items."=20
The group also talked about easing environmental regulations during power=
=20
emergencies to allow small companies and even military bases to run small=
=20
generators.=20
"If you have generators in the state, regardless of what they run on, becau=
se=20
we're entering this emergency period in the summertime and will be short of=
=20
power, you should be allowed to turn them on," said Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-E=
l=20
Cajon.=20
Hunter said small generators could produce about 500 to 600 megawatts durin=
g=20
a power emergency if exemptions to various clear air requirements could be=
=20
made.=20
Officials discussed ways to allow FERC to control wholesale prices without=
=20
violating ideological positions staked out by high-ranking Republican=20
officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney, who oppose price controls=
=20
and favor free markets.=20
Rep Jane Harman, D-Torrance, said she would support a finding by FERC that=
=20
power wholesalers should not be allowed to charge market rates, but rather=
=20
rates more tightly pegged to the cost of generating power.=20
"We're not talking about artificial caps," Harman said. "We should insist=
=20
that the FERC not renew their market-based rate authority. And if we go tha=
t=20
route, it takes us to the same place and avoids the ideological fight."=20
The meeting did not result in any specific proposals but participants prais=
ed=20
the bipartisan nature of the talks and said it would result in a unified=20
approach in Washington.=20
"We have a responsibility to make sure the federal government takes it's ro=
le=20
seriously," said Rep Gary Condit, D-Modesto. "We clearly understand what ou=

Regulators open investigation into alternative power providers=20



By Michael Liedtke
ASSOCIATED PRESS=20
April 19, 2001=20
SAN FRANCISCO =01) Hoping to prevent California's bleak power outlook from=
=20
becoming even darker, state regulators Thursday launched an investigation=
=20
into why alternative energy providers aren't producing more electricity.=20
With the action, the California Public Utilities Commission hopes to=20
determine if legitimate business reasons or ulterior motives underlie the=
=20
reduced output by an independent group of small generators that provides mu=
ch=20
of the state's energy.=20
These alternative generators =01) known in the industry as "qualifying=20
facilities," or QFs =01) have been scaling back or shutting down as debts o=
wed=20
by California's two largest utilities pile up. The QFs are owed an estimate=
d=20
$700 million by bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric and financially crippled=
=20
Southern California Edison.=20
Some QFs say the unpaid bills have forced them to defer much-needed=20
maintenance, leading to more equipment breakdowns that reduce electricity=
=20
output. Other QFs say they simply can't afford to keep operating.=20
The PUC is worried some QFs are trying to take advantage of the California=
=20
crisis to get out of long-term contracts that require them to sell=20
electricity at prices far below the current market rate. Several QFs are=20
suing to get out of those contracts so they can cash in on the open market,=
=20
said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood.=20
All the QFs want is to be paid for bills that date back as far as November,=
=20
said Jack Raudy, a spokesman for the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee,=
=20
which consists of 10 alternative power producers owed a combined $410=20
million. Those 10 generators produce about 3,000 megawatts =01) which Raudy=
 said=20
was enough electricity for 3 million homes.=20
"We are outraged (by the PUC's investigation)," Raudy said. "We have heard =
so=20
much rhetoric over the past five months and still haven't been paid a dime.=
=20
That is what we are worried about."=20
Raudy estimated his group is operating at about 95 percent of capacity.=20
After the temporary closure of several QFs contributed to rolling blackouts=
=20
around the state last month, the PUC ordered PG&E and SoCal Edison to begin=
=20
paying the generators for the energy purchased since March 27.=20
But the order has done nothing to help the QFs recover the past debts. The=
=20
QFs are now in line in bankruptcy court with 30,000 creditors owed money by=
=20
PG&E, which expects its unpaid bills to rise to $5.5 billion by the end of=
=20
this month.=20
If the QFs get desperate enough, they may decide to push SoCal Edison into =
an=20
involuntary bankruptcy case, Raudy said.=20
PUC Commissioner Geoffrey Brown defended the alternative energy providers=
=20
during Thursday's hearing.=20
"Any QFs that are not operating right now are doing so for financial reason=
s,=20
not to game the system," he said.=20
California will need all the power that it can get from the QFs this summer=
=20
when rolling blackouts threaten to become a daily occurrence.=20
Combined, the QFs account for about one-fourth of California's total power=
=20
capacity, according to the PUC.=20
The QF output will become even more essential this summer because Californi=
a=20
won't be able to import as much electricity from the Pacific Northwest as i=
t=20
has in the past. A lack of rain has left the Pacific Northwest's=20
hydroelectric supply at its second-lowest level ever, and it could diminish=
=20
to a record low if the recent drought continues.=20
"We are not going to be able to look to the Pacific Northwest to meet our=

needs," Wood said after reviewing a new report on the hydroelectricity=20

The looming blackouts and electricity price increases caused by California'=

Fearing the frustration could boil over into terrorism, the PUC Thursday=20

Legislators Unite Over Energy Price Issue=20

Power: Bipartisan congressional delegation called together by Davis says U.=
S.=20
must step in to protect state from manipulation by suppliers.=20

By MITCHELL LANDSBERG and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, Times Staff Writers=20

?????This may be the surest sign yet of the depth of California's energy=20
crisis: A bipartisan cross-section of the state's congressional delegation,=
=20
brought together Thursday by Gov. Gray Davis, not only agreed about the=20
severity of the problem but also about the need for swift federal=20
intervention.=20
?????"This meeting did not have the word 'Democrat' or 'Republican' used=20
once," Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), said of the unusual spirit of=20
cooperation at the meeting near Los Angeles International airport.
?????Members of both parties said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=
=20
must slash wholesale electricity prices so California utilities can once=20
again afford to buy power. Since January, the state government has been=20
buying electricity on their behalf, as skyrocketing wholesale prices put=20
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison billions of dolla=
rs=20
into debt and many power suppliers refused to sell to them; PG&E has since=
=20
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
?????Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that it is strong=
ly=20
opposed to price caps, and FERC has refused to grant them, California=20
Republicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that the=20
administration will agree to some other form of price regulation. They=20
brushed aside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their=20
ideological belief in a free market.
?????"This is not a free-enterprise situation," Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpin=
e)=20
said after the meeting. "In fact, it's just the opposite."
?????Specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices=20
charged to California and those charged in other Western states, he said=20
California clearly has been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs.=
=20
Under federal law, the FERC must regulate the prices of companies if it fin=
ds=20
they are exerting "market power" to drive prices to unreasonable levels.
?????Executives from two Texas energy companies, meeting with legislators i=
n=20
Sacramento, denied Thursday that they had caused natural gas prices in=20
California to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical=20
pipeline into the state.
?????After the extraordinary meeting in Los Los Angeles, Rep. Brad Sherman=
=20
(D-Sherman Oaks) said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats=
=20
and Republicans appeared to be their relative faith--or lack thereof--in th=
e=20
ability of President Bush and his administration to help California. There=
=20
has been much speculation that Bush, who lost California in November, has n=
o=20
political motive to help the state.
?????"We Democrats," said Sherman, "hope very much that our skepticism is=
=20
proven wrong."
?????Davis--who sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and th=
e=20
governor's newly appointed chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman--said he=
=20
used the meeting mainly to discuss the importance of conservation by=20
Californians this summer and to ask the congressional delegation to pitch i=
n.=20
Five Republicans and more than a dozen Democrats attended the gathering.
?????Feinstein said Thursday that she has asked for a third time to meet wi=
th=20
Bush to discuss the energy situation. Meeting with Times reporters and=20
editors Wednesday, she described a recent meeting with Vice President Dick=
=20
Cheney in which, she said, he "ignored" her appeal for federal assistance.=
=20
?????Feinstein has been among those critical of natural gas companies, sayi=
ng=20
they appear to have constricted access to a California-bound pipeline to ru=
n=20
up prices.
?????The Brattle Group, a respected consulting firm, alleged Wednesday befo=
re=20
an Assembly committee that Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. had=20
manipulated the market by charging so much for the rights to their pipeline=
=20
capacity that they had, in effect, withheld access to it.
?????That action, the experts said, directly forced companies trying to=20
deliver gas to California to look for alternatives, clogging other pipeline=
s=20
and causing a surge in prices.
?????The explanation, El Paso executives said, was simple: Demand for gas=
=20
soared in California because generators that use gas to make electricity=20
increased production last year in response to the energy crisis.
?????"We're not withholding capacity--no one is," said El Paso Merchant=20
Energy President Ralph Eads. "With these prices, you want to sell every=20
molecule."
?????In other developments Thursday:
?????* The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its=
=20
ailing utility arm to financial health is in "deep trouble and could be=20
rejected by legislators," the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency said i=
n=20
a note to clients, citing legislative and other sources. A rejection of the=
=20
deal "would be a humiliating setback for the governor," S&P said.
?????The agreement calls for, among other things, the sale of Edison's=20
transmission grid to the state for $2.76 billion and the sale of $2 billion=
=20
in bonds--both designed to pay off the utility's huge electricity debt.=20
Edison agreed to several constraints, including the sale of electricity to=
=20
the state at prices tied to the cost of producing power.
?????Since they returned Monday from a two-week recess, state legislators=
=20
have been sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a=20
desire to tinker with aspects of the deal. Some lawmakers have said publicl=
y=20
that a bankruptcy protection filing by Edison, like that of PG&E, might not=
=20
be such a dire outcome.
?????But a senior Edison executive said it is "way too early" to give up on=
=20
passage of the proposal, which legislators have not yet seen in official fo=
rm.
?????"There is an education process to do here," the executive said of the=
=20
highly detailed 38-page document. "The legislators should be asking=20
questions. That is appropriate."
?????* The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether=20
alternative energy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding=
=20
supplies from PG&E and Edison, which owe them hundreds of millions of dolla=
rs.
?????The action, Commissioner Carl W. Wood said, was prompted in part by=20
lawsuits some providers have filed seeking release from their contracts wit=
h=20
the cash-starved utilities. The producers of solar, wind and geothermal=20
energy account for more than 25% of California's electricity supply.
?????"The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long,=
=20
hot days of summer," Wood said.
?????Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC=20
needs to address the $700 million the producers are owed. "All we have gott=
en=20
is rhetoric from the governor, the PUC and the utilities," he said.
?????* An $850-million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious=20
megawatts appears to be running into roadblocks, compounding predictions by=
=20
state officials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June.
?????Davis signed the conservation spending package last week, earmarking=
=20
$242 million of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to=20
distribute to the state's investor-owned utilities to support existing=20
conservation programs.
?????But Barbara Hale, director of the PUC's Division of Strategic Planning=
,=20
said Thursday that since Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy=20
protection April 6, the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds.
?????Hale, testifying before a state Senate committee, said PG&E's=20
decision--coupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could=20
follow a similar route to U.S. Bankruptcy Court--has complicated her agency=
's=20
efforts.
?????PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition the=
=20
Bankruptcy Court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust and=
=20
separated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings. She said if th=
e=20
court denies the request, PG&E would ask to be permitted to pay the expense=
s=20
anyway. The process, she added, could take about a month--too long in the=

view of some legislators, given increasingly gloomy energy forecasts for la=

spring and early summer.
?????Deputy Director Bob Therkelsen of the California Energy Commission sai=

his agency had been counting on a number of small power producers to bolste=

Although lawmakers are skeptical of the state's multibillion-dollar deal to=
=20
acquire the power lines of Southern California Edison, the head of the=20
utility's parent company warned yesterday that failure to approve the accor=
d=20
could lead to a "long and costly" bankruptcy.=20
But John Bryson, chief executive of Edison International, told The Chronicl=
e=20
that he thought legislators would "want to do the right thing" by approving=
=20
the multibillion-dollar agreement and preventing Edison from following=20
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy court.=20
Bankruptcy for California's two largest utilities could have severe=20
consequences for consumers. Financial analysts said a worsening of the=20
state's energy mess would increase the possibility of higher electricity=20
rates.=20
Nevertheless, lawmakers are unlikely to accept the Edison deal -- at least=
=20
not in its present form.=20
"We are going to go through this thing extensively," said state Senate=20
President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. "There are a lot of concern=
s=20
about the valuation."=20
Still, he said, legislative backing for the accord remains possible as long=
=20
as Edison is open to amending some of the terms.=20
"The Edison people are smart enough to know that the Legislature is going t=
o=20
have its say," Burton said.=20
Indeed, sources familiar with the matter said Edison expected a certain=20
amount of tinkering with the deal and would not resist efforts to reach=20
common ground with lawmakers.=20
"The Assembly members do not view bankruptcy as a favorable alternative,"=
=20
said Assemblyman Herb Wesson, D-Los Angeles. "There will be a big effort to=
=20
try and work something out."=20
Edison's Bryson seems eager at this point to present himself and his compan=
y=20
as reasonable business partners who are willing to negotiate in good faith.=
=20
This contrasts sharply with the state's relations with PG&E, which turned=
=20
acrimonious after PG&E blindsided the governor with its bankruptcy filing.=
=20
Each side blamed the other for the collapse of earlier negotiations.=20
"We made the decision at an early stage that this was a massive problem for=
=20
the state and that the best course was to find a practical solution that=20
would allow us to get on with operating our power system," Bryson said.=20
Bankruptcy, he said, "is absolutely a last resort. It's a long and costly=
=20
process."=20
It is also the last thing Wall Street wants to see. On Wednesday, rating=20
agency Fitch Inc. joined Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Service in=
=20
warning that California's credit rating could be lowered because of the=20
state's energy mess.=20
"The state may be forced to issue junk bonds," said Carol Coale, an energy-=
=20
industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. "This could lead to =
a=20
surcharge on electricity bills to guarantee the bonds."=20
Bryson, not surprisingly, defended Edison's agreement with the governor as =
a=20
prudent alternative to bankruptcy.=20
"This is a very good deal for the state," he said. "It is not a bailout.=20
Edison gives up a lot to make all this possible."=20
Southern California Edison will sell its power lines to the state for $2.8=
=20
billion. It also will provide low-cost power to California for 10 years and=
=20
drop a federal lawsuit seeking full recovery of nearly $5 billion in past=
=20
debt.=20
Critics say the state is paying far too much for Edison's transmission syst=
em=20
-- more than two times book value -- and that the power lines are of little=
=20
use unless PG&E's grid also can be acquired.=20
"It's a multibillion-dollar ratepayer bailout of Edison," said Doug Heller,=
 a=20
spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa=20
Monica. "Edison gets off scot-free."=20
Under the most likely scenario, lawmakers will seek to reduce the amount pa=
id=20
for Edison's power lines and to increase the role of the California Public=
=20
Utilities Commission in regulating the utility.=20
They also will try to come up with a workable contingency plan for the stat=
e=20
if PG&E remains adamant in its refusal to sell off its part of the power=20
grid.=20
"The deal on the table is still salvageable," said Michael Shames, executiv=
e=20
director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. "But Edison=
=20
needs to understand that what it got from the governor is only a framework,=
=20
not set in stone."=20
For his part, Bryson signaled that plenty of room existed for give and take=
=20
on the issue.=20
"We're just at the initial stage," he said. "We always have accepted the=20

State regulators last month announced an electric rate increase that would=

y=20
and punish power pigs while sparing energy misers.=20
Now, much of that is up in the air.=20
Higher rates are surely coming -- but not before June. And exactly which=20

``Little details are moving billions of dollars around,'' said Nettie Hoge =

All the proposals assume a ``tiered'' structure that forces the heaviest=20

consumers could see their average rates go up anywhere from 7 percent to 30=
=20
percent or more.=20
Among them:=20

l=20

=20
cents for customers of Southern California Edison.=20
?What regions of the state will pay? The commission agreed to raise rates=

additional 1.2 million San Diego Gas & Electric customers.=20

commission would vote on a plan May 14, condensing to a few weeks a process=
=20
that normally lasts nearly a year.=20
Each of the major proposals before the commission assumes that residential=
=20
customers using less than 130 percent of their baseline -- which is the=20
average basic level of use for each region of the state -- would be exempt=
=20
from higher rates. That's mandated under a new law that allows the state to=
=20
buy power. Customers already pay higher rates for exceeding their baseline.=
=20
Each major proposal also sets new ``tiers'' with progressively higher rates=
=20
for ``medium'' use at 130 to 200 percent of baseline and ``heavy'' use over=
=20
200 percent of that level.=20
But that's where the similarities end.=20
Differences=20
The first distinction among the leading plans comes in the form of an=20
assumption: How many residential customers will avoid any increase because=
=20
they don't exceed 130 percent of their baseline? Davis says more than half,=
=20
commissioners say a little under half and PG&E says less than a third.=20
The second difference among the plans is a real difference: What happens to=

everyone else?=20
Under the plan by utilities commission President Loretta Lynch, medium PG&E=
=20
users would see average bills rise 9 percent and heavy users would see bill=
s=20
increase 36 percent.=20
Davis' plan says medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 11 percent=
=20
while heavy users would pay 37 percent more. But the average total bill=20
increase for PG&E residential customers, including those who are exempt,=20
would be 20 percent under his plan and 24 percent under Lynch's, according =
to=20
a statement on the governor's Web site.=20
Business customers would see proportionately greater increases, averaging 3=
0=20
percent under Lynch's proposal and 26 percent under Davis'.=20
The most consumer-friendly of the various proposals comes from=20
consumer-rights group TURN. They suggest an overall average residential=20
increase of 7.5 percent.=20
TURN's plan assumes utilities cannot charge other customers more to make up=
=20
for the energy misers shielded from rate increases under state law.=20
PG&E disagrees with that interpretation. The utility wants other residentia=
l=20
users to make up for any lost revenue from exempted customers through highe=
r=20
rates. Under the utility's plan, residential customers would see an average=
=20
rate increase of nearly 30 percent.=20
``The proposal these folks are pushing rips the heart out of that law,'' sa=
id=20
Matthew Freedman, staff attorney for TURN.=20
Another issue affecting consumers is how the utilities can bill for=20
electricity used in April and May, before the final plan is approved.=20
Utilities want surcharge=20
Utility officials have objected to making the rate structure retroactive.=
=20
Instead, to recoup the revenue, they are proposing a flat surcharge that=20
everyone would pay, regardless of how much they use.=20
Edison proposes a higher surcharge added to bills for a shorter period of=
=20
time -- in this case, June through August. PG&E officials are suggesting a=
=20
smaller surcharge that would be spread out over 12 months.=20
``It'll probably be something closer to the PG&E proposal,'' said Paul=20
Clanon, the commission's director of energy issues.=20
All the rate increase proposals stem from a commonly understood problem:=20
California's current, frozen rates don't generate enough money to cover the=
=20
wholesale price of power. The PUC raised rates 10 percent -- or one cent pe=

The Fitch credit rating agency made it unanimous Wednesday when it warned=
=20
that the thickening electricity quagmire, as well as lower than expected ta=
x=20
revenues in February and March, could mean broader risk for the state's=20
budget.=20
The announcement is a signal that Fitch, too, may downgrade its ratings on=

Earlier this week, Gov. Gray Davis announced that the average bill for=20

Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have already issued their o=

credit warnings, although none of the three agencies has downgraded the=20

Bond ratings are important yardsticks that bankers and investors use to pri=
ce=20
municipal and corporate bonds. A downgrade would force California to offer=
=20
bond buyers higher interest rates going forward, costing taxpayers.=20
The state was last at a lower A rating back in 1994.=20
Moody's changed California's Aa2 general obligation bond rating outlook fro=

n=20
the state began buying electricity for the utilities.=20
The deciding factor for Fitch, said Fitch vice chairman Claire Cohen, was t=
he=20
disagreement over how the money from the new electricity rate increase will=
=20
be spent.=20
The California Public Utilities Commission ruled in late March that money=
=20
generated by higher electricity bills should go first to pay the state=20
Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the=20
utilities. PG&E has argued that if the state is paid first, there won't be=
=20
any money left for the company.=20
The utility is formally challenging the PUC decision, and the move threaten=
s=20
to hold up the estimated $12 billion to $14 billion of bonds the Department=
=20
of Water Resources plans to issue to buy more electricity.=20
``With that being appealed, you don't have a clean authorization,'' Cohen=
=20
said. ``It signals to me that it could delay the financing process.''=20
A second concern is that the state isn't collecting as much in taxes as=20
expected, Cohen said. Tax collections for both February and March were belo=
w=20
forecast. The amount of personal income tax the state collected in those=20
months fell short by $455 million, or 14 percent less than expected.=20
Cohen said she made her decision before hearing that the state's power cost=
s=20
now exceed $70 million a day. Cohen and David Hitchcock, the California=20
analyst for Standard & Poor's, agreed those rising costs are a definite=20
concern.=20
``It doesn't take much of a change in economic growth to make some of these=
=20
projected fund balances disappear and so we're very worried about what the=
=20
current economic activity is, particularly in Northern California with some=
=20
of the problems with the high-tech area,'' Hitchcock told analysts and=20
investors last week in a conference call.=20
Other economy-watchers expressed concern.=20
Sandy Harrison, assistant director of the state Department of Finance, said=
=20
the move reinforced the importance of solving the power problems soon.=20

End To Deregulation of Nevada Power



CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Gov. Kenny Guinn signed a bill
Wednesday that would stop the sale of Nevada power plants, halt
deregulation and bail out struggling utilities with a new rate
system.


The Senate and Assembly gave the measure final approval earlier
in the day and rushed it to the governor. The bill was crafted to
keep Nevada from suffering from a power crisis similar to
California's.


``I must tell you this is a great relief,'' said Guinn, a former
utility executive, as he signed the bill into law. ``Nothing can
control escalating costs, but we're in the best position to protect
ourselves.''


Legislators made a last-minute change to add language that
ensured consumers would get a break on rates if utilities profit
from sales of excess power to other states.


Guinn said the bill takes care of the most pressing energy
issues, but other deregulation-related bills are sure to follow.
That includes a plan that would allow major power users, such as
casinos and mines, to buy power on the open market.


Legislators also are working on plans encouraging energy
conservation and ensuring the poor can pay their utility bills.

PG&E Co. Issues Statements On the Increase in the State's Cost for Power



SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 18, 2001 via NewsEdge Corporation  -

FROM:   John Nelson, Director of the News Department Pacific Gas and


Electric Company


There seems to have been some confusion yesterday over the effect
Pacific Gas and Electric Company's bankruptcy filing may have had on
energy prices. I thought it might be helpful to provide a few useful
facts and figures, to help you pin down the truth behind what may be
driving the state's energy costs higher.


Yesterday, Governor Davis claimed that the state was paying
roughly $20 million more for electricity every day as a direct result
of the bankruptcy filing by PG&amp;E. While it's understandable, even
laudable, that the Governor would want to fully explain the downsides
of utility bankruptcy, this claim is simply not accurate. The Governor
should know better.


Consider the facts:


--  On January 19, the credit ratings of California's two largest


investor-owned utilities -- PG&amp;E and SCE -- were downgraded to


below investment grade by every major rating agency.


Generators immediately raised concerns about continuing to


sell power to such non-creditworthy entities.


--  The state reacted by passing AB7x, which authorized the state


Department of Water Resources to make $400 million in power


purchases. Less than two weeks later, on February 1, the


Governor signed AB1x, which authorized DWR to buy power on an


ongoing basis at least through 2002, until the utilities could


be restored to creditworthiness. The clear understanding in


the legislative debate was that the DWR would purchase the


full "net open position", which is the amount of additional


generation needed, beyond what the utilities themselves own or


have under contract, to meet customer demand.


However, a few weeks later, in spite of the clear intent of


state law, it was revealed that DWR was not buying the full


net open position, and had no intention of doing so. It was


only buying power that it considered "reasonably priced" and


was leaving the ISO to buy whatever was necessary to keep the


lights on -- an amount that most estimates place at 10- to


20-percent of the state's daily electricity need.


--  The ISO, in turn, revealed its intention to attempt to pass


along the costs of these last-minute, high-cost, spot-market


purchases to the state's non-creditworthy utilities (despite


existing FERC tariffs which precluded the ISO from doing so).


PG&amp;E has estimated that its share of these costs was roughly


$10 million a day; SCE has a similar estimate. (We don't know


for sure, because we haven't seen the bill. The DWR won't say


how much power it's buying, and at what cost, and neither will


the ISO.)


--  On February 14, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission


informed the Independent System Operator that it could not


force generators to sell to non-creditworthy entities (namely,


both PG&amp;E and SCE). This order appeared to force the DWR to


purchase the full net open after all. The ISO responded the


next day with its own interpretation of the FERC order, saying


the order was limited to "emergency" power only. The ISO also


sought and obtained in federal court a temporary restraining


order (issued by Judge Damrell), forcing generators to


continue selling to it.


--  On February 22, five power generators filed a complaint with


FERC seeking to clarify that the ISO's interpretation of the


February 14 order was contrary to FERC's intent.


--  On April 5, the Ninth U.S. Court of Appeals reversed Judge


Damrell's lower court order affecting one of the generators,


Reliant, saying the generator was no longer required to sell


electricity to the ISO without assurances of payment.


Presumably this order would apply to other generators, if they


sought such assurances.


--  On April 6, PG&amp;E noted in the announcement of its Chapter 11


filing that one of the reasons for the decision was the


"financial exposure to unreimbursed wholesale energy


procurement costs" caused by the state's failure to assume the


full procurement responsibility.


--  On April 6, unrelated to PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing, FERC issued


an order responding to the generators' Feb. 22 complaint


against the ISO. In this new order, FERC reaffirmed its


February 14 order that the ISO could only buy power on behalf


of creditworthy entities, meaning neither PG&amp;E nor SCE.


--  On April 9 in remarks reported in the press, the Governor's


office acknowledged the State's "bill for energy purchases


will increase by upward of $8 million a day after a ruling


last week by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission," once


DWR started buying the full net open position, rather than


force the ISO to try to bill the utilities. It seems likely


that the $8 million was an estimate based on only one of the


utilities' costs, not the combination of both.


--  On April 11, the ISO discontinued its daily practice of


publishing the total amount it spent on energy the day before.


--  Despite the history, the state continues to try to avoid


buying the full net open position. On April 13, in response to


the FERC order -- NOT the PG&amp;E bankruptcy filing -- the ISO


sent a "murky" notice to generators promising that "any bid


accepted by the ISO will be deemed to have the financial


support of another Qualified Party or DWR as specified in this


notice." Generators were reportedly underwhelmed by the


assurances contained in the letter.


--  Yesterday, in response to the Governor's claim that bankruptcy


was driving up the state's costs, Gary Ackerman, spokesman for


the Western Power Trading Forum, said "I don't believe, nor


have I ever heard, of a bankruptcy surcharge being added to


the cost of power.... If anything, I think that generators and


marketers would take solace in the fact that bankruptcy brings


order to an otherwise volatile situation."


What does it all mean? Clearly, the increase in the state's costs
have come as a result of the DWR finally covering the state's energy
needs, as promised in AB1x. This change in DWR's buying habits has
come as a direct result of the February 14 and April 6 FERC orders
that the ISO only sell to creditworthy entities. These orders were
issued independent of PG&amp;E's bankruptcy filing and apply equally to
PG&amp;E and SCE.


Neither PG&amp;E nor SCE have been creditworthy since mid-January,
when their credit ratings were reduced to below investment grade, and
the DWR, ISO and Governor's office have been aware of the effect of
the FERC order since mid-February.


Some generators have suggested that California has been paying a
credit penalty since December, when the utilities' deteriorating
financial situation gave rise to payment concerns. There appears to be
far more evidence that the state's coy approach to AB1x implementation
has created far more uncertainty in the marketplace than has PG&amp;E's
Chapter 11 filing.

J.D. Power and Associates Reports/ Nationwide Decline in Customer=20
Satisfaction of Electric Utility Service Among Midsize Businesses




Price and Value Performance Hit Hard Across Nation;


Satisfaction in California Continues to Plummet


AGOURA HILLS, Calif., April 19 /PRNewswire/ -- Midsize business customers,
who are responsible for approximately fifteen percent of the nation's
electricity consumption, are very critical of electricity prices, according=
 to
the J.D. Power and Associates 2001 Electric Utility Midsize Business Custom=
er
Satisfaction Study(SM) released today.  Consequently, the study's nationwid=
e
customer satisfaction index fell -- from 100 points in 2000 to 97 in 2001.


(Photo:  http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20010419/LATH066-a


http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20010419/LATH066-b

http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20010419/LATH066-e )


"The entire country was affected by higher natural gas prices this winter,
and with more states re-evaluating deregulation, midsize business customers
are especially sensitive to electricity prices," said Jeffrey Conklin, seni=
or
director at J.D. Power and Associates.


The 2001 study shows that average overall customer satisfaction with
California's "big three" investor-owned utilities -- Pacific Gas and Electr=
ic,
San Diego Gas and Electric, and Southern California Edison -- fell an
astonishing 14 index points among midsize businesses compared to the
2000 study.


"In California, electric utility satisfaction among midsize business
customers has virtually fallen into the Pacific," said Alan Destribats,
executive director of the utility practice at J.D. Power and Associates.


The study finds that the chief determinants of satisfaction among electric
utility midsize customers are a provider's company image, price and value, =
and
power quality and reliability.


As expected, midsize business customers were extremely critical of
performance in the areas of company image and price and value.  Even outsid=
e
of California, satisfaction in the price and value component fell more than
any other factor -- from an index score of 100 in 2000 to 93 in 2001.


Power Quality and Reliability


Utility performance in power quality and reliability is improving, with
the national index increasing by 3 points.  Although the number of
interruptions and outages experienced was relatively the same in 2001 as it
was in 2000, midsize businesses report much shorter outage durations, falli=
ng
from an average of seven hours for the longest outages in 2000 to four hour=
s
in 2001.


Retail Competition


"Opening utility markets to competition has proven to be a difficult
process and, so far, midsize business customers are giving the industry poo=
r
marks," said Destribats.


The study shows that midsize business customers located in states with
competition not only are less satisfied than are customers in other states,
but they are also significantly less satisfied now than last year.  The stu=
dy
also shows that more midsize businesses have switched electricity providers=
.
Of midsize businesses eligible to switch power suppliers, 9 percent have do=
ne
so, up from 5 percent in 2000.


J.D. Power and Associates interviewed representatives from more than
7,200 midsize businesses, including manufacturers, retailers, business and
consumer services firms, health care providers and other midsize businesses
throughout the United States.  Midsize business owners are defined as those
who normally spend $1,500 to $25,000 per month on electricity.  The study
shows that midsize businesses are now spending an average of $4,827 per mon=
th
on electricity.


The study shows that utilities in the south region of the United States
consistently receive higher ratings across all factors of customer
satisfaction.  Likewise, these midsize business customers also report the
lowest levels of monthly electricity expenditures, on average.  Midsize
businesses in North Carolina spend the least for electric usage ($3,885 per
month on average), while those in New Hampshire, Nevada and Utah spend the
most ($5,700 to $5,800 per month on average).  The study also shows that
midsize businesses in Alabama and Florida report the most service
interruptions and outages within the past 12 months, and those in Washingto=
n
report the fewest.


East Region


PPL Utilities, serving east Pennsylvania, ranks highest in overall
customer satisfaction with midsize businesses in the eastern United States.
PPL Utilities ranked highest in the East Region in four of the six factors
that comprise customer satisfaction, with its primary strength in price and
value.  Other solid performers in this region include Public Service Electr=
ic
and Gas, Allegheny Power and GPU Energy.


Midwest Region


LG&amp;E Energy, the parent company of Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Ga=
s
and Electric, ranks highest in overall customer satisfaction with midsize
business electric service in the Midwest.  LG&amp;E Energy midsize business
customers give high ratings for power quality and reliability, customer
service, and billing and payment.  Alliant Energy, AEP-Midwest and Xcel
Energy-NSP also rank high in midsize business customer satisfaction in the
Midwest Region.


South Region


Southern Company ranks highest in overall customer satisfaction for
midsize business electric service in the South Region and received the high=
est
customer satisfaction index score among all utilities included in the study=
.

70,000-megawatt Program




Turbines in Place for 70,000-megawatt Program


SAN JOSE, Calif., April 19 /PRNewswire/ --
Calpine Corporation (NYSE: CPN), the nation's fastest growing independent
power producer, announced today it will purchase 35 model 7FB and 11 model =
7FA
gas-fired turbines from GE Power Systems. With this announcement, Calpine h=
as
firm orders in place for the delivery of 203 turbines. When operated in a
combined-cycle application, this represents 50,000 megawatts of baseload
capacity.


The agreement marks the company's second large volume turbine acquisition
from GE and is an important component of Calpine's five-year strategic plan=
 to
have 70,000 megawatts of generation on line by the end of 2005. Calpine wil=
l
take delivery of 5 turbines in 2002, with the remainder of the contract to =
be
filled by the end of 2005.


"This purchase significantly strengthens Calpine's leadership position in
project development," said Doug Kieta, senior vice president-construction f=
or
Calpine. "Calpine's aggressive turbine procurement program also strengthens
Calpine's first-mover advantage as we expand our development program and en=
ter
new electricity markets across the country."


"GE Power Systems is pleased to provide Calpine today's technology of
choice for power generation," said Delbert Williamson, President of GE Powe=
r
Systems Global Sales. "Our FA technology is the most proven advanced
technology available, and we're confident our evolutionary FB technology wh=
ich
has been designed using GE's Corporate-wide Six Sigma initiative will provi=
de
Calpine highly competitive power generation."


GE's current fleet of F technology gas turbines recently surpassed
3.8 million hours of operation around the globe. GE's 7FB turbine is an
evolution of the current 7FA model and is designed for higher efficiency,
lower life-cycle cost power generation. By employing this new technology,
Calpine will continue to generate electricity competitively while consuming
less natural gas and producing fewer emissions than a typical power plant o=
f
comparable size.

suppliers of power generation technology, energy services and management
systems with 2000 revenue of $15 billion. The business has the largest
installed base of power generation equipment in the global energy industry.
GE Power Systems provides equipment, service and management solutions acros=
s
the power generation, oil and gas, distributed power and energy rental
industries.


Based in San Jose, Calif., Calpine Corporation is dedicated to providing
customers with reliable and competitively priced electricity.  Calpine is
focused on clean, efficient combined-cycle, natural gas-fired generation an=
d
is the nation's largest producer of renewable geothermal energy.  To date,

I am interested, but it's probably more important that Jeff Dasovich and 
Sandi Mccubbin (in our SF office) know, so that they can keep the politicos 
informed (and keep them from doing something stupid).

I agree with Mark's points.  While we have advocated our merger with PGE 
(which did not concentrate market power) we have intervened in opposition to 
most others.  Moreover, there is some hope that the German government will 
take the opportunity to use the proposed utility merger to force greater open 
access.   We will likely encourage that action and may oppose the merger 
otherwise.   Most mergers in this industry are defensive, not procompetitive, 
and, in my view, deserve no credit for convergence, innovation, or 
liberlization.

Subject: Speech to the British Institute of Energy Economists

Margaret - apologies for the delay in getting comments to you on your 
speech.  Due to press of other matters I will be brief.

First, your speech caption, refernecing "mergers" is somewhat different than 
the topic shown in the agenda, i.e., "Industry Structure and Competitive 
Behaviour", but I trust you are wroking that out with the BIEE.  

Second, in your first paragraph, you note that developments in the energy 
sector over the last decade are due to the mergers of the last five years (a 
point I will retrun to later), but in any event, not entirely consistent in 
terms of timeframes.

Third, I am surprised that the Enron Corp. view is that gas and electricity 
markets grew as they did over the decade due to mergers.  In the past, things 
like unbundling and non-discriminatory third-party access have featured 
prominently in our advocacy.  Indeed, though it was not my role at Enron, I 
would have thought that in many of the recent electricity mergers pre-dating 
Order No. 888 we would have joined the chorus of voices arguing that these 
mergers concentrated market power, and that such market power could only be 
mitigated with the provision of non-discriminatory third-party access (an 
argument we will be repeating in, e.g., Germany, as noted below).  Finally, I 
would note that in the past, I thought we had questioned the value of mergers 
as an impediment to competitive markets, as I recall Ken Rice gave an 
infamous address/speech, in which he described "good" mergers and "bad" 
mergers, i.e., defensive mergers like Houston Industries and NorAm.  I 
actually borrowed heavily from that speech two years ago, in paris, but if we 
have changed our tune, that is good to know.  Even the "good" mergers 
identified in his/my speech, e.g., Enron/Portland, have had the "goods" 
thwarted, in part, by regulators, who would not let us do all we wanted to do 
that was pro-competitive.  Also, in the past, we have used as a good example 
of "convergence" the arbitrage we have done at Sithe's facility in NY, 
pointing out that we are in an "energy" or "BTU"market, not gas alone, or 
electricity alone.  Not clear to me that mergers in the US demonstrate this.  

Fourth, accepting that it is the Enron Corp. view that mergers are symbolic 
of the convergence of gas and electricity, and are what yield the many 
beneifts of competition that you dsicuss elsewhere in your speech (I do, of 
course, agree with all the platitueds that competition yilds more service 
offerings, innovation, etc.), you should be aware, coming over to this 
market, that a number of mergers are taking place that we have expressed 
concerns about in comments to the regulators, and will do so in the future.  
here are some you should be aware of:  Veical integration in the UK 
electricity industry (not clear yet that this will result in better/more 
service, but definitely loss of counter-parties, re-bundling of business 
before retail unbundling/competition has taken hold); Exxon/Mobil 
(consolidation in the upstream sector in Continental Europe, which is already 
concentrated), VEBA/VIAG in Germany (probalby okay, assuming thrid-party 
access is allowed/enhanced to the wires).  Just FYI, any objections we have 
are usually communicated confidentially. 

Fifth, if you are ging to emphasise mergers, as per your title and opening 
paragraph, I question the inclusion of all the discussion on privatisation, 
which is good, but does not seem to demonstrate the benefits of merger 
activity, which I read is the premise of your speech, per paragraph one.  In 
addition, recitation of ownership of miles of gathering lines and 
transmission lines does demonstrate change in aggregate ownership, but not 
clear it is all due to mergers (e.g., I thin NNG is just capital expansion), 
nor does the connection get made that this has lead to innovative or enhanced 
service offerings.  I do think excellent points can be made about the 
deregulation/divestment of gathering, and getting it out of federal 
regualtroy purview, but that is not in the speech at this point.

Sixth, you describe "network industries" well, but in the broader context of 
your speech, I think your listeners will assume you are referring to the 
physical network, rather than the Enron vision, which you capture accurately, 
nor is it easily understood how this demonstrates or adds to your point about 
convergence.  

Seventh, in your table of converged companies, you could be asked about the 
fact that Duke has already disposed of the pipeline assets it acquired in the 
PanEnergy deal (since sold to CMS), apparently keeping only the trading 
business.  Also, our pieeline assets to do not serve our cogen facilites in 
NJ, so not clear to me that thisdemonstrate convergence in the East Coast.

Hope this helps.  I will be travelling today and Monday, but if you have 
questions, please leave me voice mails, and I will return your calls.

P.S. at p. 7 you describe "secular" change.  I assme that this should read 
"sectoral" change.

Mark

Dear Mr. Kean:

My team is pulling together the briefing books for our upcoming Highlands
Forum meeting in Carmel Valley.  These books include a list of short
biographies.  Your biography, provided to me by Dick O'Neill, currently
reads as follows:

"Mr. Steven J. Kean is Executive Vice President and Chief of Staff for Enron
Corporation.  Mr. Kean's responsibilities include government affairs, public
relations, corporate communications, advertising, and administration.  Mr.
Kean also serves on the Executive Committee of Enron.  Mr. Kean has a B.A.
from Iowa State University and a J.D. from the University of Iowa."

I wanted to provide you with the opportunity to send a slightly longer
biography, if you so desire.  The general length of our biographies is
usually roughly 15-20 lines.  If I do not hear from you, I will assume that
the above entry is fine.

We look forward to seeing you in Carmel Valley!

Warm regards,

		 Subject: Re: Comments on FERC November 1 order

Just to pile on with the issues, I will add a few thoughts of my own for 
issues that we might want to consider in our November 20 comments.   
Re: the application of the price cap to only PX and ISO, Commissioner Massey 
is not totally on board.  He specifically asked about capping the forward 
market.  He raised the idea that he had gotten from the San Diego hearing 
that there be an accepted forward contract for a specified timeframe (18-24 
months) and specified rate, and that all loads must buy a minimum percentage 
of their needs from this contract.
A staffer (Don Gelinas) asked whether the forward/bilateral market 
(presumably uncapped) could take care of investment recovery so that 
generation not be cancelled in California.
Dynegy and other marketers raised the issue of the test to be used by the 
Commission in reviewing transactions above the soft cap.  Specifically, what 
is opportunity cost?  As long as the test is not known until after the fact, 
there will be lack of secuity selling into the California and greater 
incentive to sell elsewhere.
Hobbs from Williams raised the possibility that if the Commission does not 
eliminate the soft cap (his preferred approach), that the cap should be 
temporary and escalating and there should be limited time for raising issues 
and retaining the refund liability (he suggested that the refund liability be 
only for one month).
Many, especially the utilities, raised their position that the Commission 
should not institute penalties only on the load.  They claimed this was 
one-sided and suggested if penalties were required, they needed to be applied 
to the supply side as well.  They also argued that the load could not meet 
the 5% test.
Massey had a concern at the end of the day that the Commission's 
encouragement of forward contracts will be stymied by the CPUC by their 
authority in reviewing prudence of the utilities' purchases.
Larcamp asked at the end of the day for information on the cost of generation 
before deregulation - normalized for gas prices and emmission prices of 
today.  The marketer on the panel added that we would need to include 
stranded costs.
There was almost no support for the single price auction in California.
The California politicians argued that the ISO Board structure needed to be 
changed, but that California had jurisdiction to change it, not FERC.  A 
Court battle was threatened.

		 Subject: Re: Comments on FERC November 1 order

There are a few other issues we need to look into:

Larcamp told Hartsoe and I after the meeting that FERC may clarify that the 
price caps and reporting obligations apply only to bids into the PX and ISO 
-- ie no bilateral transaction will be subject to the requirements.  He asked 
if knowing this would change any of our views (esp peaking plants, though I 
suspect it's already too late for that).  My gut reaction is that so long as 
the market continues to clear through the centralized exchanges this 
"exemption" for bilateral transactions won't matter much, but let's think it 
through.  Is EOL or APX an alternative?
Massey specifically asked us to address forward markets in our comments.  
Specifically, "has FERC done everything it can to encourage forward market 
development?"  In addition to any other points we might make, I think we 
should argue that "PJMing" the market won't facilitate and may even hinder 
forward market development.  Also, we should advocate actions by FERC that 
take away second-guessing by the CPUC in order to reduce utility fears about 
contracting forward.
We have to give the Commission a way out on price caps.  We need to think 
through whether there is something we can live with here, or we should take 
the approach I took in my testimony:  FERC should encourage the state to 
provide rate protection for selected customer classes by putting those 
requirements up for bid (ie get the utility out of the commodity business as 
much as possible).
Finally, on governence issues we should argue for a narrowe role for the ISO 
as a way of diffusing the emotional governence debate.  Analogy:  if the ISO 
is simply the air traffic controller all parties will simply be interested in 
retaining the most technically competent people (not hiring or appointing 
their lackies or friends).  So long as the ISO has a role in setting prices, 
acquiring supplies or running the market, it is destined to be controversial 
and highly politicized.  Those functions should be left to the market.

For purposes of our discussions, Alan and I have put together an outline of 
issues raised in the FERC meeting today that we might consider putting in our 
comments to FERC.  Our written comments would also include the issues we have 
already raised in our white paper and our oral comments at FERC.  Of course 
to the extent we have discussed things in our white paper we could simply 
cite the paper.  Given the potentially long list of issues to be addressed, I 
haved left a voice mail asking Seabron if he is available to help Alan.

Looks good.  Some of his questions suggest he's going to include a fair 
amount of industry reaction -- which could be a mixed bag, some are clearly 
threatened by efficiencies in bw markets.  Looks like it will be a really 
good story.  He definitely appears to be excited by it.

The attached letter is being delivered this morning to the FERC 
commissioners.  Since the letter concerns a matter currently pending before 
the commission it will also be served on the parties.  We plan to talk to the 
press about it as well.  A number of other companies and organizations are 
also submitting letters and we have helped prepare an EPSA filing which 
focusses specifically on California.  Our best information at this point is 
that the FERC staff report regarding California is generally accurate, and 
therefore, favorable.  While it will mention periodic exercises of market 
power, it is expected to lay blame for California's woes at the feet of 
California's own decisions about market structure.  It is further expected 
that the report will not provide a basis for ordering refunds.  On the other 
hand, the Commission's order (to be considered tomorrow along with the 
staff's report) is expected to at least put refunds on the table for comment 
and to discuss, and perhaps implement, further price caps.  This is just our 
best guess at this point.  the Commission has put special emphasis on putting 
the report and order under wraps until wednesday.

Exelon Completes Acquisition of 49.9 Percent of Sithe
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
===============================================================

Exelon Corporation and Sithe Energies Inc. announced the successful 
completion 
of Exelon's acquisition of 49.9 percent of the stock of Sithe. The remaining 
50.1 percent of Sithe will be owned by Vivendi (34 percent), Marubeni Corp. 
(15 percent) and Sithe Management (1 percent). Vivendi Universal retains 
a blocking minority interest of 34 percent in the company and PECO Energy 
(which, along with Unicom, formed Exelon Corp.) becomes Sithe's main 
shareholder. 
PECO has also been given a three-year commitment starting from December 
2002, to buy Vivendi Universal's remaining interest. 

ANALYSIS: The announcement of this acquisition was first made in August, 
prior to the formation of Exelon Corp. Under the original agreement dated 
Aug. 11, 2000, PECO Energy is purchasing 49.9 percent of Sithe's North 
American assets, including its domestic marketing and development businesses, 
for $682 million. The acquisition marks a new direction for Sithe Energies 
and a continuation of an aggressive generation expansion plan on the part 
of Exelon. 

This divestiture by Sithe Energies signals its withdrawal from power 
production. 
Only two years ago, Sithe Energies was one of the largest independent power 
producers in the United States, operating 43 power plants from New Jersey 
to California. Sithe Energies had made a decided effort to purchase vast 
generation assets in the Northeastern United States, believing that there 
would be value in having critical mass in the deregulated generation market 
in that region. Until last year, Sithe Energies was the primary subsidiary 
of French mega-utility Vivendi, which had been creating a reputation as 
an industry powerhouse due to its assets in electric energy services, thermal 
energy supply, water distribution and wastewater management. Interestingly, 
Vivendi did not own a gas or electric utility anywhere in the world, and 
instead used Sithe Energies as the vehicle to accumulate generation assets 
as its primary entry into the energy industry. 

Indications that the company's strategy was changing began to surface earlier 
this year. In February, Sithe Energies sold 21 power plants to Reliant 
Energy for a total of $2.1 billion. The sale generated an immediate capital 
gain of about $450 million for Sithe Energies, indicating that its generation 
assets were bringing strong shareholder value for its investors, even if 
the company appeared to be exiting the generation market.

Then, in June, Vivendi announced that it had entered into a "strategic 
business combination" with Canal and The Seagram Company Ltd to form a 
new company called Vivendi Universal, a communications conglomerate for 
wired and wireless markets owning the world's largest music company, second 
largest film library, major film production studio, and a PC-based software 
game publishing company. (Note that just yesterday Vivendi Universal entered 
into an agreement for the sale of Seagram's spirits and wine business to 
Diageo and Pernod Ricard for $8.1 billion, subject to regulatory approvals). 
Vivendi also continued to expand its significant water business, through 
its subsidiaries U.S. Filter Corporation and G,n,rale des Eaux Group which 
recently won water treatment contracts New Zealand and Indonesia. In a 
separate development, Vivendi, supported by Sithe Energies, developed a 
partnership with a company named Softbank to establish a unit called K 
Road Ventures. This company represented Vivendi's strategy of creating 
an Internet company specializing in B-to-B services for utilities and energy 
services.

All of these developments indicated that, although Vivendi planned to remain 
involved in the energy industry, its focus was no longer on building a 
generation portfolio through Sithe Energies. Rather, Vivendi is building 
on its role as a major player in communications and environmental services. 
The subtext of this new direction for the company is probably Vivendi's 
attempt to reduce the debt of its subsidiaries to a reported 11 billion 
euros by the end of this year. Yet, most financial analysts agree that 
the continuing divestiture of Sithe Energies marks Vivendi's complete 
withdrawal 
from the energy production business. Vivendi has been in the process of 
spinning off a new utilities arm named Vivendi Environnment, which will 
provide energy services such as equipment installation and maintenance, 
as well as water and wastewater treatment. The K Road Ventures unit probably 
will be operated within Vivendi Environnment; however, it appears fairly 
certain that generation is no longer a part of the company's primary strategy.

According to Vivendi, this divestiture confirms the exit of Sithe North 
America from the consolidation scope of Vivendi Universal. Including the 
divestiture of GPU, which took place at the beginning of the year, the 
transactions represent a total debt reduction of around 4 billion euros 
and a net capital gain of 170 million euros in the financial statements 
for 2000.

Presently across North America, Sithe Energies still owns and operates 
about 27 power generation plants with approximately 3,800 MW of net merchant 
generating capacity. Further divestiture of these assets is expected as 
Sithe and Vivendi continue to move away from power generation. PECO (now 
Exelon) and Reliant are two companies that have quickly picked up the 
generation 
assets divested by Sithe Energies, and has been a wise move for both 
companies. 
There should be a continuing high value placed on generation assets in 
the Northeastern United States, particularly since competitive markets 
are developing more rapidly in that region of the country. Reliant's purchase 
of the Sithe Energies' 21 plants supports its strategy of acquiring 
generation 
assets and developing a strong retail capability. 

Purchasing 49.9 percent of Sithe Energies, with the option to buy the rest 
of the company in as little as two years, is also a smart move for Exelon. 
The Power Generation Group (PGG) of PECO, which remains a subsidiary under 
the new Exelon holding company, is the business unit responsible for managing 
the fossil and hydro generating stations of the company. PGG manages a 
fleet of 72 generating units that can provide 5200 megawatts (MW) of power 
using a variety of fuels. These units include coal, natural gas, oil, 
landfill 
gas, and hydroelectric power plants. Under deregulation, this variety of 
fuels is helping PECO to remain competitive and prepared to meeting the 
energy needs of diverse customers. Presently, Exelon is the largest energy 
company in the United States, but will trumped by the Entergy/FPL Group 
combination, which is expected to close over the next year. 

The addition to Exelon's generation arsenal that it gains from almost half 
the shares of Sithe Energies should factor in nicely to Exelon's overall 
position in the industry. Exelon estimates that the initial investment 
in Sithe will contribute approximately $0.01 per share to its consolidated 
earnings in 2001 and 2002. And it certainly appears that Exelon aims to 
acquire the totality of Sithe's assets, based on comments coming out of 
the company's headquarters. If Exelon were to purchase the remaining 50.1 
percent of Sithe (as soon as two years from now), Exelon anticipates that 
the transaction would contribute approximately $0.15 to its annual 
consolidated 
earnings. This may be just the move that Exelon has in mind as a complete 
acquisition of Sithe's assets would increase Exelon's generation portfolio 
to 46,500 MW, which is perhaps just what it needs to secure its place as 
one of the nation's top generating companies and keep it in the running 
with FPL / Entergy.

We need to communicate with Massey before he gets completely carried away 
blaming the interstate pipeline business for gas price spikes.  We need to 
get him the information regarding Cal LDCs failure to fill storage and their 
opposition to additional pipeline construction in the state.  Shelley -- 
could you forward copies of the LDC filings to the group.  Should Joe or I 
(or both) try to see massey when I am in town next week?

Subject: Some Background on California Gas Price Spikes--The Other Side of 
the Story

Last week, I distributed a presentation that the Brattle Group gave before 
the California Inquisition (i.e., legislative gas oversight committee looking 
into the gas price spikes at the Cal border).  

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up 
on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned 
power plants).  Edison "arranged" for the Brattle Group to be the star 
witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and 
Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their 
message was simple (and simplistic):

El Paso and Dynegy have market power.
They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas 
at the border (to "obscene" levels).
That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.

Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide 
the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets 
any questions on the topic.  It's attached.  Apologies, it's quick and dirty, 
but it provides the basics.

Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to 
offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California 
Legislature is peddling.

Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the 
California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis 
when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of 
the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

Best,
Jeff

It looks like Skilling will be able to attend the conference on May 15th.   
However, he will need to speak in the morning, because his flight leaves on

Let us know if that will work.

Subject: Ken Lay meeting with Japanese Prime Minister

Steve,

Over the last month the Japanese regulators and Government have come to the 
realization that the electricity deregulation initiatives implemented in 
March of this year have not stimulated competition in the manner in which 
they had expected. MITI and the Government are currently examining why the 
initiatives implemented in March are falling short of expectations and 
looking to move the 2003 review forward to next year. There are currently two 
multi party committees looking at the energy sector. The ruling Liberal 
Democratic Party also has one committee looking at energy. In addition, MITI 
is in the process of forming a new advisory group comprising academics to 
consider the next stage of deregulation. 

As you are aware, we have been working the regulatory aspects through MITI 
and the US Government for some time now with a degree of success - in fact, 
the majority of our 12 month goals have been achieved. Recently, with the 
addition of Kimura, we have increased our level of contact with senior 
political figures in Japan.

Both MITI and the USG continue to seek Enron's views on issues relating to 
the current deregulation process and the way Enron wants to see electricity 
deregulation. We have recently addressed the parliamentary Deregulation 
Committee which reports to the Prime Minister and regularly provide 
educational presentations to MITI on issues relevant to deregulation. 
Further, senior political figures are now recognizing that Enron can assist 
in the deregulation process in a positive way.

What we appear to have in Japan in the electricity sector is a reasonably 
clean slate and the opportunity to have a major say in how things should be 
structured in the future.

Ken Lay's links with the Republican Presidential campaign has received media 
attention in Japan and it is believed in Government circles here that he will 
receive a cabinet position if Gov. Bush is elected. As a result, Mr Lay 
currently carries a great deal of weight in senior Government circles in 
Japan. In the period prior to the Presidential election, we have an ideal 
opportunity to get our message across at the highest levels of the Japanese 
Government through Mr Lay.

A meeting between Mr Lay and Prime Minister and other senior Government 
members would significantly increase Enron's profile in Japan and assist in 
conveying our vision for the next phase of deregulation.

If Mr Lay were to visit Japan, possibly in late October or early November, we 
would also look at coordinating the Tokyo office opening with the visit and 
arrange a number of high level commercial meetings. Prime Minister Mori and 
the US Ambassador have already expressed an interest in attending the office 
opening. 

Both Joe Hirl and I would like to speak with you further about the above. 
When would be a convenient time?

kind regards

I believe the registration deadline for the Nov 7 election has passed.  I'll 
ask Eliz to forward the registration materials to you so you can be ready for 
the next election.  Also, if you were registered in Harris County before you 
may still be on the rolls at your old precinct ... you should ask.

Rick, We just heard the news that Spencer Abraham is being named Secretary of 
Energy.  Jim Crawford, our lobbyist in Michigan, has an excellent 
relationship with Spencer Abraham.  They are very good friends from their 
college days and through the  years.  They have also worked together on 
numerous political campaigns.

Last October at Governor Engler's request, Ken Lay wrote a personal check for 
$25,000 and we issued a corporate check for $25,0000 to the chamber of 
commerce to support Spencer.  This is not to mention any other support he may 
have recieved from our PAC.

Jim has always been willing in the past to faciliate meetings with Senator 
Abraham and will still be willing to do so with Secretary Abraham.  I am sure 
our DC office has a relationship with him, but feel free to contact Jim 
Crawford should you need any assistance.  He can be reached at 517-482-5000.  
Janine.  Barbara.

Dear Steve,

This is Amy Kim (I am "borrowing" this e-mail address for the next

Group (as it was known then) this past summer.  I was introduced
to you by Michael Moran.  As you may recall, I interviewed with
you back in September for a possible position within your division
for this summer.  Again, I appreciate you fitting me into your busy
schedule.  I enjoyed our conversation about the East Asian
economy.

You asked that I keep in touch with you throughout the last year of
my studies.  I recently spoke with Michael Moran to get his opinion
on how best to contact you.  He suggested that I e-mail you with
an update as to how I'm doing and of my continued interest in
working in Government Affairs and Regulations.

I will be graduating this June with a J.D. and Ph.D. in Political
Science.  I will be taking the bar exam for New York and
Massachusetts.  I would like to express my interest in joining your
group.  I feel that working within your group would provide me with
the opportunity to incorporate my vast knowledge of the political
arena as well as my interest in international law (environment,
energy, etc.).

I hope that you still consider me a good candidate for this position.
I look forward to your reply.

Regards,


Amy Kim

The presentation looks fine but consider adding this idea in a few slides:  
the continuation of a regulated structure poses considerable risk for 
utilities.  California's utilities were pushed to the brink of, or into, 
bankruptcy because of a regualtory regime which allocated price risk to 
them.  All parties are better off in a system where the regulated enterprise 
is limited to natural monopoly functions and all other acitivities are 
conducted in a marketplace.

Also, did we cover the shortcomings of the Japanese market sufficiently?

Exporters Rush to Ex-Im Bank's Defense --- Lobby Campaign to Prevent Budget 
Cuts Seeks Help Of 100,000 Small Firms

WASHINGTON -- Angry and confused that a Republican administration has 
targeted one of their favorite programs for big cuts, America's largest 
exporters are appealing for help from lawmakers. 
Boeing Co., Caterpillar Inc., Enron Corp., Halliburton Co. and others are 
launching an aggressive lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill to protect the 
Export-Import Bank from budget reductions; the White House labels the Ex-Im 
Bank as corporate welfare.
"The administration has fired its shot, and now we're firing ours," said 
Edmund B. Rice, president of the Coalition for Employment Through Exports, an 
industry group that is leading the effort. 
Since they got wind of the proposed cuts a few weeks ago, business lobbyists 
have been trying to rally sympathetic lawmakers. And executives at Boeing, 
Caterpillar and other big companies plan to contact some 100,000 smaller 
suppliers that benefit indirectly from the $12.6 billion of export loans, 
guarantees and insurance that Ex-Im Bank provided in the last fiscal year. 
Those small companies, the executives hope, will create a groundswell of 
support in Congress for the Ex-Im Bank. 
"Companies large and small who have similar interests here are banding 
together to provide an educational effort so people understand the impact of 
this," said Chris Hansen, Boeing senior vice president for government 
relations. 
Corporate lobbyists also have dug up a speech that Vice President Dick 
Cheney, while chief executive of Halliburton, gave in 1997 praising the bank 
and scoffing at those who consider it a giveaway to big business. They plan 
to pass Mr. Cheney's comments to influential members of Congress this week. 
"We'll be circulating them very broadly," Mr. Rice said. 
A spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney had no immediate comment. 
Ex-Im Bank officials aren't talking publicly, avoiding the appearance that 
they are battling the White House to overturn the proposed 25% cut in the 
bank's $865 million operating budget for the current fiscal year, which ends 
Sept. 30. But an Ex-Im official said the topic has come up in conversations 
between key lawmakers and Ex-Im Bank Chairman James A. Harmon, who is soon to 
be succeeded by Mel Sembler, a Bush campaign fund-raiser and a 
shopping-center developer. 
At first, business lobbyists assumed administration budgeteers were just 
looking for savings anywhere they could find it. Before President Bush 
released his spending plan last week, companies appealed to Mitchell Daniels, 
head of the White House budget office, in an attempt to keep the Ex-Im Bank 
cuts out of the final proposal. 
The Ex-Im Bank's corporate clients include some of the country's largest 
political contributors. Boeing, the bank's largest user, received $3.3 
billion of financing last year. The Seattle aerospace company and its 
employees contributed $1.8 million to politicians and parties during the 2000 
election cycle, 61% to Republicans, according to federal election data 
assembled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Caterpillar, a Peoria, Ill., 
maker of engines and heavy equipment that secured seven Ex-Im Bank deals last 
year, and its employees contributed more than $500,000 -- 96% to Republicans. 
Company officials deny they wanted to leverage donations to try to secure 
political support for the Ex-Im Bank. 
Many lobbyists have come to the conclusion that administration officials -- 
those of a libertarian persuasion -- oppose Ex-Im Bank as a form of welfare 
for corporations. Indeed, the White House budget plan criticized the bank's 
operations as unjustified public subsidies for companies. "That makes it a 
much more serious issue," Mr. Rice said. "We're concerned that the 
administration seems to be turning its attention in this direction." 
Barring intervention from Mr. Cheney, business groups now have largely given 
up hope of convincing the White House to back down, planning instead to use 
their muscle to convince Congress to restore the Ex-Im Bank's funding. Bank 
officials and U.S. companies argue that, far from being a subsidy, the bank 
simply allows American companies to compete with European and Japanese firms 
that receive assistance from their own governments. 
"In many markets in Asia and Africa, the bank is absolutely critical to our 
ability to sell American-made products," said Bill Lane, Caterpillar's 
Washington director for governmental affairs.

[What's Brewing in the Real Estate Market] 
No Problem, Houston 
CENTURY DEVELOPMENT is about to announce plans to break ground on downtown 
Houston's third major office development in less than three years. In another 
sign of the strength of the city's energy sector, Century is finalizing a 
headquarters deal with Reliant Resources Inc. to take more than two-thirds of 
the project's 850,000 square feet, says Edwin Murphy, a Century senior vice 
president. 
Two other towers also are underway. In 1999, Hines began building a 1.2 
million square-foot tower for Enron Corp. and late last year Crescent Real 
Estate Equities broke ground on a 27-story tower that will be anchored by 
Ernst & Young. These three projects are the first major downtown office 
projects to get underway since 1986. 
The surge is part of a renaissance of downtown Houston, where new sports 
facilities, hotels, apartment buildings and restaurants have been mushrooming 
in recent years. "The new amenities have kept people from leaving and enticed 
people to come back," says Michael Hassler, of CB Richard Ellis.

Dutch Gas Competition Grows Despite Sluggish Reforms
By Germana Canzi
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

03/07/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- The Netherlands is emerging as an important testing 
ground for E.U. gas liberalization, as new trading hubs for competitive, 
short-term gas supplies from the U.K. and Norway emerge on the Belgian and 
German borders. 
However, much remains to be done. A group of large energy users and traders 
is preparing to confront Gasunie Thursday in a hearing organized by the 
regulator. The main issues of contention are the balancing system, which 
Gasunie conducts on an hourly basis, the extent to which transport tariffs 
are cost-focused and third-party access to storage facilities.
The emergence of competition in the Dutch gas sector is mostly due to the 
initiative of new market entrants who, despite a difficult regulatory 
environment, have managed to develop a market for short-term gas virtually 
from scratch. 
If liquidity improves in these emerging hubs, the Netherlands could become an 
important transit country for freely tradeable gas supplies to other 
countries in northwest Europe, as well as being an important market in its 
own right. However, the difficulty of implementing transparent third-party 
access systems in the Netherlands and in neighboring Germany casts a dark 
cloud over recent progress in competition. 
Since December, Enron Europe Ltd. (U.ENE), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), E.On AG 
(EON), RWE AG (G.RWE) and Electrabel SA (B.ELE) have been actively buying and 
selling gas, sourced in the U.K., the Netherlands and Norway, in a number of 
hubs between Emden in Germany and Emshaven and Oude Statenzijl in the 
Netherlands. 
David Gallagher, head of European gas trading at Enron in London, estimates 
that at least one trade a day of around 100,000 therms for a quarterly 
contract is done at the Oude Statenzijl hub, where the Gasunie pipeline 
system connects to the network of Wingas GmbH. 
An important element kick-starting short-term trading was the sale, in 
December 2000, of a 2 billion cubic meter a year Norwegian gas supply 
contract to five Dutch-based power generators. 
Robert van der Hoeven, head of fuel procurement at Electrabel, the owner of 
Dutch generator EPON, said his company uses most of the gas it imports from 
Norway for its plants in the Netherlands and trades the rest on a short-term 
basis in the Oude-Emden area. This pattern is common to the other Dutch-based 
parties to that contract. 
Trading in Dutch hubs received a further boost when Nederlandse Gasunie NV 
(N.NEG) decided, after months of wrangling with regulator DTe, to lower its 
transport tariffs by 6.5% from January 2001 and to unbundle its combined 
commodity and service tariff, the so-called CSS system, from July 2001. 
Gasunie now claims its pipeline system is fully open and transparent. To 
prove this, it says it has lost 30% of its customers in the eligible market, 
but that figure hasn't changed much since March 2000. Small wonder that 
critics say the switching figure doesn't necessarily indicate an ideal system 
of third-party access. 
According to energy consultants The Brattle Group, around half of the gas 
used by alternative suppliers goes through the 1 bcm/year Zebra pipeline from 
Zelzate to Zeeland, which was built by Dutch utilities a few years ago 
precisely because Gasunie refused to provide access on favorable terms. 
Shippers have complained that the hourly system used by Gasunie to balance 
the pipeline system raises the overall cost of shipping through its network 
significantly. Gasunie imposes a balancing charge which effectively forces 
shippers to pay for the extra gas brought into the system from storage sites, 
in addition to the capacity and transmission price. Critics say Gasunie has 
so far failed to unbundle these charges, although it agreed to do so in 
January. 
According to the Brattle Group, another controversial aspect of Gasunie's 
tariff system is that it is based on theoretical costs of constructing new 
pipelines rather than its actual costs. 
The DTe is also considering ways of reforming the storage system to make it 
competitive. BP PLC (U.BP) and Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij NV operate 
storage facilities and lease capacity to Gasunie through long-term contracts. 
The regulator is studying ways of allowing third parties access to storage 
facilities. Gasunie has so far shown little sign of negotiating more 
competitive tariffs with storage operators and passing on the benefits to 
customers, critics say. 
The growth of short-term trading in the Dutch gas market is also inevitably 
linked to its potential as a transit country for gas coming from the 
U.K.-Belgium gas interconnector and going towards the 82bcm-a-year German 
market. 
Market participants say liquidity at the Emden and Oude hubs has grown 
considerably since E.On and RWE started trading there earlier this year. 
However, the obstructive attitude of incumbents toward third-party access 
there has meant that so far most gas traded in the Netherlands has remained 
there.

WASHINGTON -- Angry and confused that a Republican administration has

to pass Mr. Cheney's comments to influential members of Congress this week. 
A spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney had no immediate comment. 
Ex-Im Bank officials aren't talking publicly, avoiding the appearance that 
they are battling the White House to overturn the proposed 25% cut in the 
bank's $865 million operating budget for the current fiscal year, which ends 
Sept. 30. But an Ex-Im official said the topic has come up in conversations 
between key lawmakers and Ex-Im Bank Chairman James A. Harmon, who is soon to 
be succeeded by Mel Sembler, a Bush campaign fund-raiser and a 
shopping-center developer.

Deal with state could take until 2002 to close
By LESLIE GORNSTEIN
AP Business Writer

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

LOS ANGELES (AP) - A tentative deal aimed at rescuing Southern California 
Edison from insolvency might not close in time to prevent the utility from 
begging creditors for more patience, Edison officials said Tuesday. 
The utility's tentative, $2.7 billion agreement to sell its power lines to 
the state could take until 2002 to be consummated, thanks to complicated 
legal issues and other paperwork, an Edison official told bondholders Tuesday.
Once the deal is signed, Edison will try to borrow against the promised cash, 
but Edison International Chief Financial Officer Ted Craver admitted the 
utility might have to ask creditors to simply wait for their money until it 
has the $2.7 billion in hand. 
Energy suppliers owed money by Edison did not immediately return calls for 
comment Tuesday. 
At least four groups of suppliers have sued Edison for millions in unpaid 
bills going back months. Edison and fellow utility Pacific Gas & Electric 
have said they have lost $13 billion on the open power market thanks to 
soaring prices paired with state-imposed price caps. 
PG&E's parent company was able to recently borrow $1 billion to pay its 
stockholders and its debuts. It did not use any of that money to pay PG&E's 
bills. 
Edison's disclosure, meanwhile, shocked state officials. 
Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, initially declined to comment 
on the status of the Edison deal, but eventually said, regarding its closure, 
"We're optimistic it will be sooner rather than later." 
The pacing would have nothing to do with whether fellow utilities Sempra 
Energy and PG&E also sell their transmission lines to California, Craver 
said. 
Among the things that could delay the deal's closing is Edison's need to find 
landowners on whose property its lines were built to assure no legal 
agreements are being violated by the sale. Edison would also have to pin down 
exactly what it would be selling to the state - terms that might not be 
decided until after a deal has been inked, Craver said. 
"Trust me," Craver said in a phone call after the conference. "There are a 
lot of legal-type documents - stuff that you and I ... would think of as a 
bloody nightmare." 
The disclosure comes at a time when an increasing number of power suppliers 
are suing the utility for millions in unpaid bills. 
Edison also disclosed Tuesday that two more lawsuits had landed in its lap - 
one by a group of wind-powered generators including Enron Wind, the other by 
two suppliers including New York-based Caithness Energy. 
Both suits were filed during the past five days, Edison Assistant General 
Counsel Barbara Reeves said. It was not immediately clear how much the 
complainants were seeking; neither Enron nor Caithness returned calls for 
comment. 
The two filings bring the total number of suits by renewable-energy suppliers 
against Edison to four, the utility said. The city of Long Beach and 
CalEnergy Operating Group, a geothermal supplier, have also sued for back 
payments. 
CalEnergy alone has said it is owed $45 million in November and December 
payments. 
The line sale, part of a multifaceted, tentative deal with the state that 
could save Edison from insolvency, could take anywhere from several months 
into next year, Craver said. 
The tentative deal, announced by Gov. Gray Davis Feb. 23, calls for the state 
to pay more than twice the book value for Edison's lines. 
It also would require Edison to sell cheap power to the state for a decade 
and for Edison to end its lawsuit against state regulators. The suit asserts 
that price caps imposed by the California Public Utilities Commission are 
illegal under federal law. 
Additionally, Edison's parent would have to return $420 million it collected 
from the utility over the past several years. The money was used to pay debt, 
buy back stock and pay dividends to investors. 
SCE, PG&E and Sempra have complained they are near bankruptcy because of 
soaring prices on the open market combined with the state-imposed price caps 
for consumers. 
Sempra and PG&E have yet to announce similar line-sale deals with the state, 
though they and the governor have said negotiations are ongoing. The total 
cost of the 26,000 miles of lines has been estimated at $4.5 billion to $7 
billion.

Sierra Pacific CEO Doubts SEC OK Of Enron Unit Buy-Report

03/06/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Sierra Pacific Resources (SRP) CEO Walter Higgins 
said in an interview last week that he doubts the company's $3.1 billion 
acquisition of Enron Corp.'s (ENE) utility Portland General Electric will be 
approved by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the Las Vegas Sun 
reported Tuesday. 
The SEC must find that Sierra Pacific is in a strong financial position 
before it will approve the deal, but the company is currently weakened by 
having lost millions of dollars in fuel and purchased power costs, Higgins 
said in the report.
A $311 million rate increase to cover those costs began March 1, but Higgins 
said that money would only pay back those expenses and wouldn't improve the 
company's stability to a level the SEC would find adequate, according to the 
report. 
The Public Utilities Commission can halt the rate hike and order refunds if 
it decides the hike isn't necessary. The PUC is holding hearings to determine 
the prudency of the hike, and members of the state's powerful casino and 
mining industries have filed to intervene. 
Sierra Pacific's plan to shore up its financial position through the sale of 
its 10 power plants, worth nearly $2 billion, may also be in jeopardy. The 
state Senate is considering a bill to block the sales, and Nevada Gov. Kenny 
Guinn recently sent a letter to the PUC asking that it reconsider its order 
allowing electric utilities to sell assets. 
Financial analysts have said that not allowing Sierra Pacific's two utilities 
to sell their assets would have a ripple effect on the company's financial 
position. The asset sales are tied to low-priced power contracts, and if the 
sales are canceled, the low-priced power will be gone as well. 
"If the divestiture is stopped...the state may be dealing with a much bigger 
rate increase," Steve Fleishman, Merrill Lynch utility analyst, told Dow 
Jones Newswires recently. 
Sierra Pacific is the parent company of electric utilities Sierra Pacific 
Power Co. and Nevada Power, which serve customers in the state's North and 
South, respectively.

Many Power Deals Announced by California Governor Still Not Final
By Jason Leopold

03/06/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Dow Jones Newswires 
LOS ANGELES -- Many of the long-term power-supply contracts announced by 
California Gov. Gray Davis this week remain under negotiation or are the 
subject of ongoing lawsuits, power suppliers said Tuesday.
The lack of finality to the deals raises questions about the state's success 
in covering its power needs, particularly going into what is expected to be 
an unusually tight summer. 
Generators said privately they were surprised the governor went ahead with 
his announcement Monday, given that many of the contracts haven't been 
signed. 
David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power, who negotiated the contracts on behalf of the state, conceded that 
details remain to be worked out. "This is not a done deal," Mr. Freeman said, 
adding that credit concerns are keeping generators from signing the deals. 
Gov. Davis announced Monday that California has secured 40 long-term 
contracts that will provide California with about 629 million megawatt hours 
of electricity over 10 years, at a price of more than $40 billion. A megawatt 
hour is roughly the amount of electricity needed to power 1,000 homes. 
Several of those forward deals, however, involve contracts originally held by 
Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp. 
(PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric at the California Power Exchange, 
previously the state's main power market. 
The governor seized those contracts earlier this year, just before the Power 
Exchange liquidated them to cover hundreds of millions of dollars in power 
bills the utilities had failed to pay. 
The contracts, which total about 1.3 million megawatt hours of electricity 
and have a market value of about $1 billion, according to market sources, 
have yet to be paid for or signed over to the state. Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), 
one of the suppliers that sold the contracts to Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed, has 
sued Gov. Davis for unlawfully commandeering those contracts. 
Although Duke has reached an interim settlement to continue providing power 
to the state Department of Water Resources until April 30, the company and 
the Davis administration still have to "develop a comprehensive long-term 
settlement to pay for the power supply contracts," said Duke spokesman Tom 
Williams. 
The governor went ahead with the announcement, because the California 
Department of Water Resources believes it will be able to finalize and sign 
the contracts over the next several weeks, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio 
said. 
Separately, several suppliers named in the governor's announcement Monday -- 
including Duke, Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Mirant Corp. (MIR), Sempra Energy, 
Enron Corp. (ENE) and Avista Corp. (AVA) -- said they have yet to sign final 
agreements with the state, although negotiations were ongoing. 
"We are working in good faith with the DWR toward a long-term contract," said 
Art Larson, spokesman for Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra. Mr. 
Larson said Sempra signed a terms of agreement with the water-resources 
department and expects to reach a final agreement over the next several 
weeks. 
Reliant said it has only signed a short-term contract with the state that 
expires in about two weeks. The company will only sign a long-term contract 
once it's paid more than $400 million owed by Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed, 
spokesman Richard Wheatley said. 
Mirant said it also won't sign contracts with the state until it's paid. 
Enron said it's reached agreement on terms with the state, but has some 
credit-related details to hammer out. "Everything's been agreed to except for 
some credit technicalities," Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. 
Meanwhile, small, independent power plants in California that are capable of 
generating 1,800 megawatts of power are shut down because their owners 
haven't been paid by the state's two main utilities, the California 
Independent System Operator said Tuesday. 
The decline in small-plant output has contributed to the state's power-supply 
problems the past two months. Partnerships involving El Paso Corp. (EPG), for 
example, shut down 350 megawatts of generation last weekend due to 
nonpayment, the company said Tuesday. 
SoCal Ed hasn't paid the owners of the smaller generators, known as 
"qualifying facilities," since early December, which means the generators are 
still owed for electric production in October, while PG&E has paid only a 
small percentage of its qualifying facility bills since its last full payment 
in early January. 
The plants, one-third of which are powered by renewable sources like wind and 
solar power, meet almost 30% of California's electricity needs. Almost all of 
the closed generators are fueled by natural gas, and many haven't been able 
to pay their gas suppliers and have been cut off from their gas supply. 
The California Senate Energy Committee plans to vote on legislation to create 
a new pricing system for all qualifying facilities this week. The proposed 
bill would cut the prices to qualifying facilities from about 17 cents a 
kilowatt-hour the past eight months to about eight cents, depending on the 
price of five-year natural-gas contracts the generators can sign. The plants 
that run on renewable resources would be paid 5.4 cents a kilowatt-hour.

US Natural Gas Prices Fall As Demand Slips In Most Areas

03/06/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. natural gas physical prices fell Tuesday as demand 
eased, except in the Northeast and Southeast areas of the country, traders 
said. 
Heavy snowstorms in the upper Northeast supported some pricing, as did cooler 
weather in Georgia, the Carolinas and the Florida panhandle.
Some storage buying occurred in Texas "if they could make it work," a trader 
said. 
"It was a pretty uneventful day," a Gulf Coast trader said late Tuesday. 
Also, because of the snowstorm in the Northeast, traders had purchased gas 
ahead of time to make up for needed load, he said. 
A scheduled work outage on Enron's Transwestern San Juan lateral in New 
Mexico was completed, and the return of a power plant in California 
alleviated demand in the West, traders said. 
At the Arizona-California border hub, buyers paid around $13-$33 a million 
British thermal units, West Coast traders said, down as much as $15 from 
Monday. 
At PG&E Citygate, prices were mixed, with buyers paying $9.75-$10.65/MMBtu, 
down 25 cents on the bid, up 15 cents on the offer. 
In the Midwest, Chicago Citygate prices fell 7 cents-8 cents to a range of 
$5.42-$5.53/MMBtu. Alliance Pipeline into Chicago traded around 
$5.47-$5.52/MMBtu, down 4 cents to 9 cents from Monday. 
The Nymex April natural gas futures contract settled at $5.315/MMBtu, down 
2.1 cents in a tight, range-bound, uneventful session that started late due 
to bad weather. 
Physical gas prices at the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana ended in a 
range of $5.25-$5.30/MMBtu, down 2 cents-6 cents from Monday. 
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line at Station 65 deals were made in a similar 
range of $5.26-$5.35/MMBtu, down 2 cents on the bid, unchanged on the offer. 
At Katy in East Texas, buyers paid $5.21-$5.30/MMBtu, down 5 cents-6 cents. 
At Waha, prices fell 9 cents-12 cents to a range of $5.15-$5.30/MMBtu.

Subject: Barton Bill

You seemed troubled by the call to Barton.  This bill may or may not be 
subsumed by the comprehensive energy bill that Congress undertakes this 
summer.  Both bills have a very difficult, if not nearly impossible, path 
ahead given that the Democrats are in no mood for compromise.  The call to 
Barton was to:  a) repair relationships (and with the Wall Street Journal 
calling Barton about his troubled past with Enron, repair is needed); b) 
proclaim victory, even of a limited nature (something I think Enron has not 
done much of); c) build a further bond with Barton so we would have more 
input at full Committee (something we will need given the chances that this 
will go off the track are real); and d) allow Enron to get significant credit 
for the defeat of price caps.  I hear from lots of DC sources that we have 
not had any success in the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  Numerous 
folks at the markup noted in private conversations that this was Enron's 
first real role in the Committee.  Thus, even though this is a very limited 
bill, the call made sense.  I do not think that this means we should call the 
White House to push the bill with them.  The bill itself still has lots of 
obstacles and many potential threats ahead.

I am forwarding some Wall Street comments from Kathryn Corbally related to 
the Transmission buyout.  

Looks like they view it as very favorable - not a major hit against EPS tied 
to full recovery of remaining undercollection.  

Not sure yet if they incorporate the going forward - maybe SCE doesn't want 
any merchant obligations?

Jim, Have sent you three notes that show some level of support to activity in 
California  
- its probably a little bias since there are a few reports out there that say

Date:     February 26, 2001
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
Highlights:
-  On Friday (2/23), Governor Davis triumphantly announced that the State of 
   California and Edison International had reached an agreement in principle 
   for the sale of its electric transmission system as part of a financial 
   recovery package. He also commented that "good progress" was made with 
   Sempra Energy and "some progress" with PG&E Corp.
-  The preliminary terms of the agreement call for the State to buy Edison's 
   transmission system for approximately $2.76 billion (2.3x estimated book 
   value) and allow for the securitization of "a substantial portion of its 
   undercollection".
-  In exchange, Edison would: 1) make payments of approximately $420 million 
   to its utility subsidiary, Southern California Edison; 2) commit the 
entire 
   output of an Edison Mission project at cost-based rates for 10 years; 3) 
   provide cost-based rates from native generation for another 10 years; 4) 
   give conservation easements on 20,000 acreas of watershed lands for 99 
   years; and 5) drop a pending lawsuit against the California Public 
   Utilities Commission.
-  We view this agreement as a positive development. Based on the 2.3x 
   purchase price, the EPS hit from the loss of the transmission lines would 
   be approximately $0.10 lower than our worst case estimate (at 1.5x) of 
   $1.90 . The agreement, however, is not final and additional details need 
to 
   be worked out before being submitted to the legislature.
-  Events to watch over the next couple of weeks include: 1) a definitive 
   agreement with Edison; 2) deals with PG&E Corp. and Sempra Energy; 3) a 
   package that the legislature can accept (which could include concessions 
   from generators); and 4) terms that are acceptable by the FERC.
-  In our opinion, the proposed deal is reasonable for EIX shareholders and 
   renews the hope for a resolution to the crisis. While our optimism is 
   tempered by the shortening timeframe, we are encouraged by the governor's 
   recent statements, which have been more positive than negative. As such, 
we 
   maintain our Buy ratings on Edison International and PG&E Corp as well as 
   on the generation companies: Calpine and Dynegy.

Other News:
In other related news, on Friday (2/23) Edison announced that all of its banks
have agreed to extend their forbearance until March 14.

*  On February 23, EIX and Governor Davis reached an agreement in principal
   in which the state would agree to buy the transmission grid and allow
   for recovery of a 'substantial portion' of unrecovered cost in return
   for EIX refunding money from its parent to the utility and dropping
   pending litigation.  This settlement appears to be a  reasonable 'shared
   pain' scenario and is consistent with the 'buyout vs. bailout'
   structure we have been anticipating. To be enacted the deal needs to be
   finalized and approved by the EIX board and the California Legislature.
   FERC also must approve the asset sale.
*  EIX agreed to sell a portion of its electric transmission system to the
   state of California for $2.76 billion and transfer $420 million cash to
   its utility subsidiary from the parent.  In return, the state would
   allow EIX to recover a substantial portion of its under-collected power
   costs and drop pending litigation in which the company is pursuing rate
   hikes.  If approved by the EIX board and California legislature this
   agreement, in concert with passage of ABX1-1, would eliminate the
   overhang that has depressed EIX shares.
*  Although dependent on several factors, we believe the net impact on
   earnings from the settlement will not be as high as the current EIX
   stock price implies.  We believe post-settlement EPS in 2002 will likely
   total at least $2.00/share, which supports a conservative valuation of
   $20 share (10X '02 EPS, a 20% valuation discount to the peer group).
*  Also late last week, PCG issued a press release indicating they had met
   with the Governor, had submitted proposals, and discussions were
   ongoing.  With the framework already established for EIX, we expect a
   PCG settlement could be announced in the near future. PCG's negotiating
   flexibility is limited relative to EIX because their generation rates
   are lower, their under-recovered balance is higher, and the potential
   cash 'refund' from parent to subsidiary being requested by the
   government is probably larger.
*  PCG's transmission system has a book value of roughly $1.5 billion.  At
   2.3X book value, these assets could potentially be worth $3.5 billion.
   Assuming a parent company to utility cash transfer proportional to the
   one proposed for EIX, we estimate PCG would refund $780 million. PCG's
   stock price also reflects an earnings impact more punitive than implied
   by a settlement of this nature. We believe a deal like this would
   support post-settlement EPS of at least $2.50/share which supports a
   conservative valuation of $25/share (10X '02 eps, a 20% valuation
   discount to the peer group).
*  Because EIX has a 'deal in principle' the stock is trading at a premium
   to PCG despite having lower potential 2002 earnings power. Those
   investors who believe PCG will strike a deal that is similar in
   structure and proportional to EIX's settlement should purchase PCG over
   EIX at this juncture.

Investment Highlights:
o    On Friday, Governor Davis announced a preliminary agreement with Edison
International (EIX; D-2-2-9; $14.69) on a financial resuscitation plan.  The
plan follows the basic framework previously outlined by the Governor.

o    The state will purchase Edison's transmission assets for $2.76B, or 2.3x
book value.  This would help pay off some of Edison's net $4.1B of
undercollections (a number agreed upon with the Gov.)  The remainder will be
recovered through a bond financing tied to a dedicated rate component to be
carved-out of Edison's rates.

o    In exchange, Edison will agree to: 1) Drop the lawsuit against the PUC, 
2)
Invest $420M back into the utility from the parent, representing tax
overcollections , and 3) Sell power from its hydro and nuclear assets at cost-
based rates for the next 10 years.  Edison also agreed to sell power from its
unregulated Sunrise plant, currently under construction, at cost-based rates
for 10 years.

o    A number of uncertainties remain in Edison's deal, and it is still
preliminary.  The exact terms and language will be very important, 
particularly
given the need to issue securitization bonds.  It is impossible to provide
exact earnings guidance based on this deal, but the only loss of earnings 
power
would appear to come from lost transmission earnings (-$0.20-$0.25/share) and
potentially lower generation earnings depending on the terms of cost-based
rates.

o    This is a significant step forward for Edison and the resolution of the 
CA
power credit crisis.  However, it could be for naught if the other utilities
cannot work out deals.  We believe Sempra Energy (SRE; B-2-1-7; $22.10) is
relatively close, but PG&E's (PCG; D-2-2-9, $13.70) talks were flailing last
week.  We continue to see little chance that this plan can move forward and
pass through the legislature unless all the utilities are on board.

o    We believe PG&E is willing to work a deal within this framework.  
However,
the simple problem is that PCG's undercollection numbers are much bigger.  At
YE 2000, PCG's net undercollection was more than $5B and we believe this may
have reached $7B by the end of January.  Selling the transmission for 2.3x 
book
would provide only $3.5B, leaving the other half to be recovered though the
dedicated rate component/securitization.  It may be that the only way the
numbers can work is with a rate increase.

Despite the significant hurdles that remain, we believe the momentum toward a
constructive outcome is improving.  To that end, we maintain our Accumulate
ratings on EIX and PCG for high rate accounts.

Oops. My computer sent the message before I was finished.  I continue to hope 
that there is more opportunity than risk in this for us.  Price volatility is 
in the news like never before and our main product is price risk management.  
I know that the inquiries are up, I hope EES and ENA can get some sales out 
of it.  More utilities have been approaching TNPC, EES and ENA about taking 
over their merchant functions.  On the policy side, we are working the issue 
on both a state and federal level.  Whether this country does anything 
meaningful to deal with the current crisis comes donw to one person ... Linda 
Breathitt.  Ken Lay spoke with Secy Richardson and Sen Schumer about 
proposing rulemaking initiatives to FERC.  We are working the RTO process 
hard elsewhere in the country and coming up with messages to arm our 
remaining allies around the country.   THis is the biggest time for us on 
this issue since the very beginnings in California and New Hampshire.  In the 
current panic, however, we will be decimated if we are associated only with a 
move to keep price caps from going into effect (I saw your message to Mona).  
I am going to read the comments next, but I start off thinking we need to 
avoid running headlong into the price cap movement; we may be better off 
trying to co-opt the movement to get broader reform.

Hang in there.

I heard you've been raising a ruckus about our activities on the price caps 
-- asking us to do more.  Thanks.  I feel as if I have been a voice in the 
wilderness for the past six months when I was trying to get people to pay 
attention to the bad things happening in CA and warning that the problems 
(mainly a threat of reregulation) will spread elsewhere.

here is our analysis of load growth.  i have no idea where cera came up with 
there's.  in short, it looks like load grew somewhere between 5% and 6% per 
year between april 1998 and june of 2000.  since then, load growth has been 
flat to negative.  from april 1998 to february 2001 it looks like typical 
load growth was around 3.7% on an annualized basis.

Hi, Steve - 

Dennis Vegas has requested budget information from Kelly on the people from 
EBS that are transferring over to Corp.  Kelly is on vacation now, for the 
next week and a half, and I wanted to check with you to make sure that it is 
OK to share these documents with him.  They are what Kelly reviewed with you 
in your initial meeting regarding the subject.  He only asked for information 
on the people shifting to Corp, not the people on redeployment, so I could 
delete that portion of these documents.  Perhaps I could only send him the 
first document that is about budget, but with the redeployment information 
taken out.

Sorry to bother you, but I am concerned about doing the right thing and 
following protocol in Kelly's absence.

Thanks, Stacy

I am looking for some help in identifying the right person(s) at: Enron
Corp., for an introduction of our software solution.  Steven, if you could
take a moment and point me to the appropriate contact I would greatly
appreciate it.

Summary of eProvisioning:
 
eProvisioning radically improves people's Time-To-Productivity by
transforming the disparate activities that allocate IT resources to people
into a secure and automatic process. Once provisioned, these resources
remain digitally connected to each person as they move through the business
cycle and are dynamically updated as necessary. At the appropriate time,
they are systematically, securely and automatically removed.  

Organizations that employ eProvisioning gain a competitive edge and access
complete security by ensuring that people are kept productive from day one,
and are prevented from becoming counterproductive beyond the day they leave.
In addition, by aligning their IT infrastructure with business priorities,
organizations can effectively manage change across the extended enterprise,
and better respond to emerging market requirements. 

eProvision Day One provides business and IT executives with the ability to
quickly identify bottlenecks and maintain accountability of the
eProvisioning process through comprehensive reporting and tracking
capabilities. As business relationships between organizations expand,
Business Layers technology provides the framework for integration and
interoperability between eProvisioning partners - suppliers and service
providers, devices and applications - which are the digital foundations of
the Internet economy. 

Please, if you could give me a few minutes of your valuable time or guide me
to the right person to describe the significant benefits of what we offer."

The Commission voted out the order 5-0, essentially as it appeared 
yesterday.  Three key changes:
They clarified that the surcharge applies to Direct Access customers (but the 
entire "rate freeze" structure remains intact for now).
The Commission reversed itself and chose not to adopt TURN's "netting out" of 
gen revenues and CTC collections, and said instead that the Commission will 
consider it as an option in the next phase (a move likely made in order to 
lower chances of a successful utility appeal).
The Commission added to the decision language saying that it will study the 
pros/cons of securitizating the utilities' power purchase costs.  They will 
submit a report on the issue to the Governor and Legislature.
On this last point, wire reports are rampant about the possibility that 
legislation will be introduced as early as today proposing to securitize the 
utilties' power purchase costs.  This action has reportedly been the result 
of discussions that occured through the night between the governor's office, 
the utilities and the ratings agencies in reponse to the fact that the 
decision issued by the PUC falls well short of what's needed to keep the IOUs 
credit worthy and solvent.  As a result of those wires stories, the 
utilities' stock has come back (Edison was down as low as 6.25 and is 
currently at 10 7/8; PG&E was at 8 7/8 and is currently at 11 7/8).  We're 
working with Sandi McCubbin, who heads-up our legislative activities in 
California, to get more info and will report back.
The hearing was dominated by highly charged anti-generator, anti-marketer 
rhetoric, which is likely to play a prominent role in the press accounts.  
Only FERC was demonized more.
Each of the Commissioners, including the most recent "interim" appointee,  
made strong statements regarding the undesirability of utility bankruptcy.
The Commission left open the possibility of "doing more" at their next 
meeting (two weeks from today), which means the negotiations with the 
utilities and ratings agencies are likely to continue. And if an agreement is 
reached, it could end up on the next agenda.

FROM SHIRLEY HUDLER:

Dave, Marty, Richard, Steve and Bill:

Thank you for taking the time this Thursday the 15th to spend time discussing 
the California situation with CalPERS.   The call is scheduled for 11:30 CST 
and will last at least an hour, possibly more.  

By way of background, ENE and CalPERS are 50/50 partners in JEDI II - which 
was created in December 1997.  JEDI II is a funding vehicle for Enron's 
energy related merchant investments.  Transactions of note are:  3.9% 
minority equity interest in EES, equity ownership in Quanta, 100% ownership 
of East Coast Power (since sold down to 51%), and participation in a number 
of E&P drilling partnerships and coal investments.  The commitment period was 
set to expire on December 31, 2000 - and was extended to March 31, 2001.   In 
addition, CalPERS invested $40 Million in The New Power Co prior to the 
IPO.   Andy and I are working with CalPERS to amend the current JEDI II 
partnership in order that we continue our successful relationship with 
CalPERS.  The Alternative Investment Management (AIM) staff that we work with 
are very supportive of Enron and we are looking at a number of opportunities 
to put their money to work in our businesses.  

CalPERS hasn't provided any specific questions that they want answered.  My 
thoughts on how to structure the call is for Marty to spend some time talking 
about California, Enron's role there and our view of the situation.  Then, 
Richard could address the regulatory status in California.  I would expect 
this to be somewhat of a freeform conference call.  One area we may discuss 
is how Enron and CalPERS can team up on a California initiative.  The AIM 
staff is interested in discussing this particular point.  

The following individuals from CalPERS senior staff will be on the call:

 Dan Szente, Chief Investment Officer
 Robert Aguallo, Chief Operating Officer

 Barry Gonder, Senior Investment Officer, AIM
 Rick Hayes, Senior Principal Investment Officer, AIM (primary Enron contact)

 Mark Anson, Senior Investment Officer, Public Equities
 Mary Cottrill, Senior Principal Investment Officer, Public Equities

 Lou Jug, Senior Principal Investment Officer, Real Estate

 Curtis Ishi, Senior Investment Officer, Fixed Income


Please give me a call if you have any questions.  For those of you here in 
the office,  we will be meeting in 
Marty Sunde's office (EB 889)

Dial:     1-888-380-9636

Is it possible to have 30 minutes of your time sometime this week to discuss

Preliminary figures for the Enron Japan website are looking promising. Since 
its launch on Tuesday, we have had 4000 page hits, with an average of 320 
site hits per day and an average stay of 20 minutes.

Advertising to date has been limited to the 300 guests at the office opening 
and the office opening press conference. We will be increasing awareness of 
the site over the coming weeks, mainly through word of mouth, and will 
finalize the articles for next month's edition in a couple of weeks.

kind regards

acknowledged that EOL was not the problem; said he couldn't believe that it

I think he will put it to rest (except for whatever damage has already been 
done).  I did promise to get some more specifics on who has told us that El 
Paso pointed to us.  Can anybody give some info on that?

I've got a few too many speeches coming up.  You are probably in the best 
position to address this crowd (time for the student to teach the teacher), 
but I'd understand if you think it would be awkward (the we should just

Steve:  Let me know if you'd like to discuss.  I like Tim's idea re: maybe 
you should take the slot.   But in my view definitely not Skilling.  I think 
you saw my thoughts about this conference in a previous email exchange with 
Schroeder re: Littlechild.  

Also, they're breaking my arms and legs about sponsoring ($3-5K range).  I 
had a thought that maybe EBS could stream the conference as an in-kind 
contribution---the PR that EBS gets out of streaming might outweigh the cost 
of providing gratis.  I had only raised it as a thought, though, and am 
surprised to see it turn up in print.  

Tim and I had both had Lee as a professor and I've been talking him about 
this conference alot and have no problem delivering whatever the news is.  In 
fact, I had already told them that they shouldn't count on us for this one 
but that we're always interested in working together.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff, I sent this e-mail to Kean last night.  I am fine with your 
recommendation for Skilling to pass on this event.  Do you want to deliver 
the news to Lee.  Do we want to offer you, Steve Kean, or me as an 
alternative?  Personally, I would like to attend but don't have much interest 
in speaking (assuming that they would allow low lifes like you or me to 
speak).  Your call on all of this.  Call bob Badeer with questions about the 
BEEP as I am heading out of town in a couple of hours.


Tim:  I've worked hard with these guys to try to make this conference the 
best that it could be, but it ain't quite there.  So I'd rather keep our 
powder dry and use Skilling at another time.  Not top-shelf enough in my 
view.  If you want to discuss further let me know.

Also, one question:

Is the BEEP stack the constrained supply curve post-adjustment bids?  I have 
that right?

I just received this e-mail from a former professor of mine at Berekely.  
Dasovich knows more about this than I do, so you should definitely talk to

Jeff and Tim,

Tim, I know Jeff knows all about the conference we are organizing and I hope
you do as well.

Rob, I and the rest of the conference organizers are wondering if you could
help us find out if Jeff Skilling from Enron would be willing to be one of
our panelists? He has been an articulate critic of the current state of our
electricity markets, and we definitely would like the genco perspective
represented.

Naturally we are hoping to get a quick answer because our publicity about
the conference will be going out shortly.

A brief description of the conference is appended below. Please let me know
if you need any additional information.

Thanks very much for your help and advice.
Lee

The summer of San Diego has prompted the School, in collaboration with UC's
Energy Institute and Competition Policy Center, to sponsor a high-level
summit conference on electricity deregulation. The focus, and the audience,
will be national, but heavily informed and influenced by the California
crisis.  The conference will evaluate (1) the wisdom of deregulation and (2)
how the pitfalls encountered so far can be avoided and remedied. The
University will facilitate an open, honest and reasoned exchange between
executive-level players from various perspectives: industry, regulators,
consumers, legislators, academics, and market and system operators.

The format entails two roundtable discussions with six speakers and a
moderator.  During the panel sessions, the speakers will engage in a
debate/dialogue on the current situation in electricity deregulation, where
we have come from, what the future holds, and what solutions lie on the
horizon. Each speaker will have uninterrupted time to speak, followed by Q&A
and discussion.  We expect a live audience of about 200, including a large
press presence.  One sponsor has tentatively offered to provide internet
streaming video services.  We hope to have a balanced group of sponsors
ranging from the American Public Power Association to energy companies.

The speakers are being arranged at this time. We have commitments from:
Loretta Lynch (Chair, CPUC), and PJM CEO Phil Harris. We have a preliminary
acceptance from Steven Littlechild (England's former primary electricity
regulator) and Laura Tyson (former Chair, President's Council of Economic
Advisors and National Economic Council, currently Dean, Haas School of
Business). We have invited FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert, and U.S.
Representative Edward
Markey, executive-level managers from several energy companies and state
legislators. Former DOJ chief economist Carl Shapiro will be on one of the
panels, as will economist Severin Borenstein, Director of UCEI and Professor
of Business and Public Policy. Michael Florio from The Utility Reform
Network (TURN) will be a consumer advocate on one of the panels. Lee
Friedman, economist and Professor of Public Policy, will briefly provide an
introduction to the panel discussions with his talk "Lighting the Stage: The
Electricity of Deregulation."

A dinner for the panelists and organizers will be hosted at UC's Goldman
School of Public Policy following the conference proceedings. We have
reserved rooms for our speakers at Berkeley's landmark Claremont Hotel. We
can reimburse those speakers who request it for coach airfare expenses and
other ordinary local expenses.

Only the three liquids one waiting now.

I have sent these to David Forster in our Project group to review first 
before I send them to yourself.  If I don't get them back today I will send 
them over the weekend so they are there for you on Monday.

Could you please send me comments back on all the other descriptions today.  
Is your fax machine at your end OK?  It's just that the other fax you sent

Subject: West Virginia Settlement

Thom and I have just completed negotiations in West Virginia involving APS, 
AEP and other stakeholders.
The settlement, being filed today is a compromise on all the issues and is 
the result of negotiations.  Enron was the only marketer involved in the 
process.  While we weighed in all the issues, there are a number of items 
that but for our persistence would not have been included in the final 
agreement.  These items include the following:

1.  Native load language
2.  Competitive metering and billing for industrial and large commercials as 
of day one, with other customers following no later than within the next four 
years.
3.  Addition of competitive bidding for default service at end of 5 years.
4.  Change from functional separation to a requirement to corporately 
separate as soon as possible but no later than within the next five years.
5.  Strong codes of conduct that form the base for more detailed rulemaking.  
(A special thanks to Lara Leibman for her assistance).

Below is a summary of the entire settlement:

1.  All customers can exercise choice beginning January 1, 2001.
2.  All utilities including IOU's, munies and coops can opt in.  APS has 
committed to opt in whereas AEP is not because it did not get any stranded 
cost and it also did not get a guarantee of full recovery of all costs 
resulting from the environmental lawsuits against them irrespective of their 
financial condition.  
3.  Competitive metering and billing as described above.
4.  Generation is deregulated.
5.  PSC continues jurisdiction over implemention, rate unbundling, 
reliability, codes of conduct, supplier licensing, construction of 
transmission lines and eminent domain authority.
6.  Native load language - Requires utilities to provide service to 
affiliated and unaffiliated suppliers only under the applicable distribution 
tariffs and proformatransmission tariffs.
7.  RTO's - Each utility must join a FERC approved RTO or its equivlent by no 
later than 1/1/03;  best efforts requirement to eliminate pancaking by 1/1/05 
if IOU's are in separate RTO's.
8.  Competitive bidding process for  default service customers at end of year 
5 for remainder of transition period.
9.  Rate unbundling requirement
10. Rates capped for first 4 years with any FERC change in transmission being 
applied as an offset to distribution.
Rates continue to be regulated through the 10th year with the rate gradually 
increasing during the second six years for the residential and small 
commercial customers.  For the large commercial and industrial customers, the 
rate regulation ends 12/31/07.
11.  A rate stabilization deferral fund is created to facilitate the 
transition to competition in years 11, 12 and 13, under which APS must 
contribute $56.75 million and AEP must contribute $81 million to be used as 
an offset to the prices paid by small residential and commercial default 
customers.
12.  Large commercial and industrial customers receive for the first 4 years, 
rate decreases in an amount to be determined by the Commission for AEP 
customers and 3% for APS customers.  The rate decrease is allocated to 
distribution.
13.  No stranded costs (either generating or regulatory assets) for AEP or 
APS, however APS gets a ten year PURPA surcharge starting at 2.6 mills per 
kwh in year one and declining to .75 mills per kwh in the last two years.
14.  Usual licensing requirements.  (AEP fought for the right to have a 
second tier of licensing where they would have the ability to certify 
marketers but we defeated that).
15. Corporate separation and codes of conduct as described above.  
16. Consumer protection and education requirements typically found in other 
plans.
17. Low income protection provisions providing a .2 mil surcharge with the 
minimum being $.40 and the maximum being $300.
18. Utility worker protection plan.

Below for your information is the plan.




At this point the plan goes to the PSC for approval and then on to the 
legislature for a resoulution approving the PSC order.  We expect that AEP 
and labor will oppose it, so it will be a close call.

A question aimed far below your pay grade.  Our most recent invoice to Enron 
(dating from April) has not yet been paid.  Our accountant, Paul Hart, 
reports that the individual to whom we had previously been told to direct the

Any guidance on to whom we should turn?

As I promised this morning at the executive committee meeting, below are some 
talking points for your use.

Overall message:  the market is working, regulation is not.

In California, peak demand rose by 10% over the last 4 years while new 
capacity grew by only 2%.  But, as you would expect, the market responded by 
proposing 8,000MW of new generation - - more than enough to offset the peak 
demand growth.  The regulatory process, at both the state and local level, 
has failed to site this new generation.  The problem is regulation, not 
deregulation.

When San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices, 
Enron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego 
customers from price volatility and provided prices below their current 
summer levels (Enron's price was about $55/MWH).  After publication of 
Enron's offer, nine other companies made offers.  Again, the market responded 
where regulation failed.  San Diego has not accepted any of these offers 
because of regulatory/legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside 
of the PX (i.e. the spot market).

In markets where siting is easier, suppliers have moved to build additional 
generation.  Enron built 3 plants in response to the 1998 price spikes.  
Those plants were planned, sited and built in less that 12 months - - in time 
for the summer of 1999.  Where regulatory hurdles are lower, the market 
responds.

The solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition 
not reregulation.  Policy makers should:

Open the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it 
is needed.

Expedite interconnection of new generation.

Expedite siting of new facilities.

Give customers a choice, so that they have better access to demand side 
solutions.


Also attached is a more detailed discussion of California, prepared by Jeff 
Dasovich of our San Francisco office.

coule you get Jeannie copies of the slides or other write ups you have on 
this.

Jeannie -- I don't know how far it is prudent to take a position on this as a 
co.  It has already become a key battleground (garnering some discussion in 
the Gore-Lieberman debate).  I think we stay away from it as a co., but we at 
least ought to put the information in front of anyone we are asking to do an 
oped so that they can make a reasoned judgement.

Hi -- I'm working on a dual gas/power op-ed (the former DeLay op-ed). I have 
Enron's message points on higher gas prices, but I wondered if we were taking 
a position on expanding natural gas exploration as Gov. Bush proposes -- onto 
more federal lands, particularly in Alaska. I read somewhere that 40% of 
potential US reserves are on federal lands.

Thanks for your help,

I think it would be very cool also and I would be willing to help as long as 
I don't have to spend any time or money.  The best source for this kind of 
help would be Steve Kean and Mark Palmer.

Ken,

I mentionned to Jeff that it would be cool if we could have a 363 (ENE) area 
code for Houston he thinks its a great idea.
We need to lobby do you have any desire to help?

I know that in the overall scheme of things this is really not important but 
I think that this should be followed up.

Let me know what you think

Regards

P.

Philippe,

Here is an outline of the 363 numbering information we talked about, the 
process is very complicated and may need us to set down with the senior 
management to explain how it works and the implications, my suggestion is 
that Ken Rice would be the best one to take it forward, as he understands the 
market and has some profile as the head of a bandwidth / telecoms company

Tony Alvarado is the lead for this one, his extension is 37801 let me know 
how you want to proceed

(Frontier Economics) or perhaps someone else.

When we have described the problems and solutions for California we have 
focussed on generation siting and flexibility to hedge.  We have stayed away 
from transmission issues on the assumption that California, with its ISO and 
PX, does not suffer from the same discrimination issues as other parts of the 
country.  Is this true?  Does California's system layer in priorities for 
utility use of the system -- eg doesn't PG&E control "path 15"?  Does that 
control provide advantageous access to PG&E?  Are there other examples and 
are there links between these "preferences" and the current problems in 
California?  As we are trying to convert reliability and pricing concerns 
into FERC action these would be helpful arguments to have available to us.

Steve,

I am a lead recruiter at the University of California at Berkeley for
Enron Analyst/Associate program.

I contacted several friends who work at Berkeley and received an invitation
from one of them to make a presentation at the weekly Faculty Seminar
of the Dept. of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research.

The students and faculty members from the business school will be also 
invited.

Berkeley in general, and Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Research in
particular, are important centers of academic research on electricity markets
(S. Oren works very closely with Severin Borenstein).

My presentation will focus on the Analyst/Associate program. I shall  also 
have
an opportunity to discuss the power markets in California (I expect many
questions) before many experts who are very  important to shaping
public opinion and regulatory agenda.

Please, let me know who in you group could help me in preparing this 
presentation
and in presenting  Enron's point of view in a more effective way.


Vince

FYI. The name of my friend who invited me:

Shmuel S. Oren, Professor
Dept. of Industrial Engineering
and Operations Research
4117 Etcheverry Hall
University of California
Berkeley, CA 94720-1777

do I need to do anything?  I believe the only transaction I had was related 
to a set of shares which were released to me earlier in the year.  Some of 
the shares were sold at that time to pay the income tax on the distribution.  
We discussed this before and my recollection is I did not have to make a 
filing.  Could you confirm by e-mail?

that he'd be available for this on Monday AM -- don't know how that fits
into the Enron schedule.  It probably makes the most sense to have her
coordinate any such meeting.  How would you recommend that we proceed?

Dear Mr. Kean:

I would like to thank you and Mark Schroeder very much for your time and
outstanding hospitality in Houston.  I very much enjoyed meeting with you
and your message, that your Chairman Kenneth Lay confirmed for dinner with
our Mayor Petra Roth was very well received and we are all very excited and
looking forward to November 30.

However it raises great interest in the question of organization of the
dinner and the additional participating chairpeople of other companies. Wil=
l
Enron now invite for that dinner, which I understand will be the gathering
of 10-12 major decision makers in the energy field? If you could be so kind
as to share with us the thoughts of Ken Lay=01%s office with regards to tha=
t
point, or give me a contact there, I would very much appreciate.

An alternative we discussed or as an addition the next day (Lunch), would b=
e
that a business-group would host an event, which could include a wider
audience of business people of Houston.  After having spoken with the Germa=
n
Consulate in Houston and with the German American Chamber here, it
unfortunately appears as if they will not be capable for s.th. we achieve.
Everybody recommended to work with the reputative Greater Houston
Partnership, whose President was on vacation last week.  I would welcome an=
y
assistance in getting us in contact with them.  Probably it would not take
too many efforts for Enron, to have them consider supporting out idea of
promoting our ideas. To help you pass them, I again include our plan for
Houston (see attached doc).

I will be in contact with your colleague Mark Palmer with regards to the
press-coverage. Thank you for your response to your earliest possible
convenience.

Yours Sincerely

Jim and Ken --

Attached is an article for eBiz (our biweekly online newsletter), which we 
are scheduled to launch at 7:30 a.m. Friday.  Kelly Kimberly has reviewed it, 
but has asked that you view the article as well.  Since only EBS employees 
received your memo about the restructuring -- and the rest of the employees 
did not receive any communication -- it is extremely important to provide 
information through this vehicle.  

Please let me know of your approval or if you have any questions.  

Thank you.

		 Subject: Friends of the Aquifer, Inc. Appeal of Denials of Petitions to DEP, 
DCA, and PSC

Chris Jensen, Executive Director of the Florida Energy Pipeline Association, 
has learned from some DEP agency contacts that the Alliance (operating behind 
the front organization known as Friends of the Aquifer, Inc.) has decided to 
drop their lawsuits appealing the denials of their petitions to more severely 
regulate pipelines in Florida.  While this is good news for those of us 
fighting the war here in Florida, the reason for this withdrawal of their 
appeals of failed efforts on three different petitions at the state level in 
Florida is because of their belief that their current activity at the Federal 
level holds greater promise of success and their desire to concentrate their 
resources in that effort.

My thoughts on this is that the pipeline industry should get organized and 
execute a "full court press" defense which is proactive as we move into 
increased future efforts at the  Federal level by the Alliance through their 
other front organizations.  These organizations have been created to burden 
pipeline competition to benefit the maritime interests.

>From my vantage point I am limited to mostly what I see in the press, but  
these front organization are winning the battle in the national press that I 
have seen and heard.  AOPL and INGAA do not come across in the press as being 
equipped or prepared to handle the shaping of the pipeline safety issues in 
the press that these Alliance front organizations have been doing.

 Our Enron government affairs folks in Washington are knowledgeable, 
experienced and capable. They have been through this battle and other battles 
in the past.  So this is not a criticism, but just a friendly observation 
from a remote vantage point, that if the entire pipeline industry does not 
develop a proactive plan to shape the issues in the national media during the 
next year, we will find it very difficult or perhaps impossible to come out 
of Congress with legislation that is reasonable and workable from a safety 
regulation perspective.  It has been my experience with the Alliance in the 
past, that to any extent they are successful,  they will then multiply their 
efforts and broaden their field of attack.

The issue is not safety of pipelines, but competition for the transportation 
of energy.  We have an industry that can be very proud of it's record of 
safety, economic benefits, reliability, public service, energy efficiency and 
environmentally favorable service when compared to any other mode of 
transporting energy.  We have learned from our experiences, research and 
mistakes in the past and will continue to learn in the future so that future 
pipeline service will be even better for our people whom we serve.  

Our entire energy pipeline industry (natural gas and petroleum) needs to 
shape the issues in the national press and tell our very good story so the 
politicians are not overrun with public opinion shaped by our maritime 
competition. 

Thanks for your interest.  This is a "heads-up" that is probably not needed, 
but I felt that there might be something in it that would help with a very 
difficult current and future issue.

Steve I need your help. Twice in the last three months I have run into the 
Chairman of AGA who has taken my head off for Enron not renewing its AGA 
dues. I understand that the dues had been paid by  Stan Horton who had 
decided that the pipeline group with INGAA representing it had no need for 
and received no benefit from the membership. I guess a few years back, when 
AGA "kicked" the pipelines out, they renegotiated the dues into some type of 
sub membership for around 85K.

AGA approached the gas marketing team and talked to Mike Roberts about 
renewing the membership and maintaining relations with his customers and 
later to Jeff Shankman who passed them off to some other person and never got 
back to them as promised.  This is a heads up to tell you that Bob Catell of 
Brooklyn Union fame- one of Enron's oldest customers and friends will be 
calling Lay.

It seems to me that pro rating the dues among ENA and EGM and maybe GPG might 
be a solution. Anyhow, I promised to pass on the complaint. Thanks.

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Special Asset Group will also become part of Enron Principal Investments.  
The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work with all the 
business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage equity investments, 
which leverage Enron's unique and proprietary knowledge.   These investments 
may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, traditional private equity and 
distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director, overseeing all activities of 
Enron Principal Investments.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Dick Lydecker, 
and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form Enron Principal 
Investments.  This new business unit will report to an investment committee, 
consisting of Greg Whalley, Ken Rice and Dave Delainey. 

 Please join me in congratulating and supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Dick 
and the other members of this group in this effort.

To Alliance Board and Associates:

As you may know, President Clinton is considering releasing oil from the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, perhaps as early as the next several days.
Regardless of what you think about release of oil from the Reserve, I hope
you will help us take advantage of this opportunity to encourage the
President to renew his efforts to pursue energy efficiency - our nation's
best long-term response to rising oil imports.

Due to the immediacy of the decision, we ask that you let us know if we can
sign you on, no later than this Monday, September 25 at noon Eastern.
Please respond with sign ons (giving us the precise company/organization
name) by reply email, or call Dave Hamilton or myself at 202-857-0666.
Thank you for your consideration and support.

The United Way kickoff is here!  The "Millionaire Game for Millions" will be 
played after the Employee Meeting this Wed. at the Hyatt.  A FREE lunch will 
be provided in the park after the game.  It will be a casual day and wear

I encourage you to click on the United Way web site to make a contribution.  
Everyone that makes a contribution by COB Friday will be eligible for the 
Governmental Affairs raffle for BIG PRIZES!!  

While I encourage you to give generously, any amount is certainly helpful.  A 
weekly contribution of:

$1 provides 8 families with a week's work of food
$2 helps teach 5 adults to read, breaking the cycle of illiteracy
$5 provides 60 seniors with a nutritious meal and social interaction at a 
senior center

For example, last year UW in the Houston Gulf Coast area fed more than 
1,000,000 seniors; helped 42,000 children attend quality childcare; and 
provided job training to 45,000 people.  Through United Way's volunteer 
allocation committees, projects are funded and reviewed to ensure 
accountability.  It is an effective way to give back to our community.  

Thanks for your support.

Dear Steve:

I have given some thought to the ideas you and I discussed regarding a 
website to promote a light-hearted view of some of the more absurd activities 
of the anti-deregulation and monopoly forces in the electricity battle.

I think my White House Writers Group colleague Michael Long would love to 
take this on.  He has an eclectic background: he spent considerable time as a 
stand-up comedian, then did a tour as the speechwriter for Tennessee senator 
Fred Thompson.  He recently had a terrific piece in the Weekly Standard 
taking the air out of Herblock, the Washington Post editorial cartoonist.

(His bio is on our website: 
http://www.whwg.com/Firm/WritersBio.cfm?StaffId=19. )  

Mike has excellent instincts for and knowledge of free market ideas, and has 
expressed them quite effectively for a number of our clients, including 
high-profile CEOs and a couple of presidential candidates.  I believe he 
could very quickly get up to speed on your issues and produce the kind of 
humorous stuff you have in mind.  I would work closely with him to make sure 
we were getting the issues right.

I propose that we begin the effort by letting Michael "loose" on the 
material.  He could get familiar with the ongoing issues in California and 
elsewhere, then come up with some preliminary material, including a few 
suggestions of how we should format it for a website

If you think he has the hang of it, we could have a longer discussion about 
how to create a permanent website and let Michael regularly write and update 
the material.  

December is typically a slow month for us and it would be a good time to give 
this a try.  Let me know what you think.  I?d be happy to set up a call with 
the three of us.

I enjoyed finally meeting you face to face at Enron and hope we can continue 
to work together.

Best,

Daniel

This is an issue we have long struggled with.  We have conducted several 
comprehensive reviews in the past and on an ongoing basis we go through a 
resource allocation process which enables subjective criteria to be 
considered in the prioritization and resource allocation process.  I think 
the project is a good idea.  Your sources would be John, Jim Steffes, and 
Rick Shapiro (for the RCR, or resource commitment process).

Subject: my work situation

Dear Steve, Jim, and Rick:
I just wanted to give you a quick update on my situation at Rice and to
inquire as to a future project with your group at Enron.

First, I apologize for my prolonged recent absences. I have had two
long-standing academic projects: one was due 4/19 (it was on "final review"
- a paper about corporate political strategy - and just was accepted for
publication at our top academic journal) and another is due 5/31. The 5/31
paper was commissioned long ago but is a key paper in a June conference
(topic is methods to study corporate political activities and the public
affairs function). In order to get it done properly, I need to forego any
work at Enron until later in the month.

A project of interest to me at Enron - and I hope one that you also have
interest - is assessing the effectiveness of governmental affairs. John
told me that he conducted such a study for the group last year. One of the
methodological challenges is to calculate the benefits that government
affairs brings - especially in a system where, for example, on the
legislative side, much of the "work" of government affairs is to block
legislation at very early stages. I suspect that govt. affairs needs to
justify its existence for internal budgets at Enron and thus the benefits
of the function are important to quantify. I'd like to review any of the
previous work and make suggestions as necessary.

At some point, let me know how you would like to proceed.

Otherwise, I hope all is well with you all.

Cordially,

Doug

I know we are holding for a later filing, but I have attached further 
comments anyway.  The document is still too rough to send out.  We need to 
take the opportunity, as soon as possible, to get a hard hitting, thoroughly 
researched and carefully written document in front of the Commissioners.  
California's reaction to the Judge's recommendation is likely to give FERC 
(especially the new commissioners) a feel for how irrational the California 
politicians can be.  We will have a limited opportunity to take advantage of 
that realization.  We need to hit it hard in the pleading, our conversations 
at the Commission, the Hill and the media.

I made a couple of suggestions on slide 17: a wording change in the first 
bullet and I dropped ECT from the example list -- I think the EES and EBS 
examples are more alike and make the point more cleanly.

I think showing the ranges for MDs on slides 14 and 19 is fine.

I didn't see a reference to the possibility of an EMD level.  I think that's 
probably OK -- Jeff can still speak to it if he wants to when he discusses 
the ranges in the MD level.

Dear Mr. Kean,
In the effort to schedule the first meeting of the Advisory Board of the 
CEC's Initiative on North American Electricity Restructuring and the 
Environment we are proposing the following three dates:
1. Thursday January 11th, 2001
2. Tuesday January 16th, 2001
3. Thursday January 18th, 2001

Due to the difficulties with finding one date that will allow everyone to 
attend the meeting, we will select a date based on the greatest number of 
participants who can attend. For those who will not be able to attend the 
meeting on the selected date, we will try and find an alternative such as a 
conference-call link. 

The one-day meeting will take place at the CEC's offices in Montreal, Quebec, 
Canada, and the CEC will be happy to cover the costs associated with your 
attendence at the meeting. 

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me at 
ahorsman@ccemtl.org, or at 514-350-4335. We look forward to seeing you in 
January.

Regards, 
Andrew Horsman

Looks good.  I think you implicitly say this, but I think you should make it 
more explicit:

The continued growth of the new economy is threatened by our electricity 
infrastructure more than anything else.
The high tech industry requires market driven solutions to reliability and 
pricing not the old style command and control regulated monopoly approach.
Let's start getting the word out!

		 Subject: SEPTEMBER 2000 EIS BILLING / s100105.xls

PLEASE E-MAIL ALL BILLING ISSUES TO "CLIFFORD.JACKSON@ENRON.COM" OR TO THE 
SPECIFIC SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM(S) AS DETAILED BELOW:       Year 2000 changes:
Phone charges:  Phones are being charged to the person's company and cost 
center where possible, otherwise to the rent location.  The description will 
start with People\ or Room\ unless it was entered manually at the source.

Data connections:  One connection is being charged for each room instead of 
one connection for each port in a room.

Attached  are spreadsheets with the detail supporting the expenses for all 
the various services provided by Enron Information Services. 

EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, 
and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&T 
calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in 
EB, 2AC, 3AC, or JF.  For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by 
Tammy Anderson for this purpose.  

People-specific services are billed to the company and cost center 
corresponding to the employee's SAP company and department. Video conference 
usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings are based on 
a company and cost center furnished by the resource using the service.

EIS bills services on a one month lag.  We take a snapshot of the Corporate 
Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha 
phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the SAP company and cost center 
for each employee.  This snapshot is taken about the 21st of each month for 
use as a source for billing information.  

Please examine these billings for accuracy.  If the billings are incorrect, 
generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting 
Corporate Administrative Services or the person should be moved to the 
correct SAP department by contacting the HR representative.  If the room 
number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, this may be 
corrected by sending the room number along with the telephone number to Notes 
Mail ID "Move-Team".

PLEASE E-MAIL ALL BILLING ISSUES TO "CLIFFORD.JACKSON@ENRON.COM" OR TO THE 
SPECIFIC SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM(S) AS DETAILED BELOW:       Year 2000 changes:
Phone charges:  Phones are being charged to the person's company and cost 
center where possible, otherwise to the rent location.  The description will 
start with People\ or Room\ unless it was entered manually at the source.

Data connections:  One connection is being charged for each room instead of 
one connection for each port in a room.

Attached  are spreadsheets with the detail supporting the expenses for all 
the various services provided by Enron Information Services. 

EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, 
and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&T 
calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in 
EB, 2AC, 3AC, or JF.  For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by 
Tammy Anderson for this purpose.  

People-specific services are billed to the company and cost center 
corresponding to the employee's SAP company and department. Video conference 
usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings are based on 
a company and cost center furnished by the resource using the service.

EIS bills services on a one month lag.  We take a snapshot of the Corporate 
Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha 
phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the SAP company and cost center 
for each employee.  This snapshot is taken about the 21st of each month for 
use as a source for billing information.  

Please examine these billings for accuracy.  If the billings are incorrect, 
generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting 
Corporate Administrative Services or the person should be moved to the 
correct SAP department by contacting the HR representative.  If the room 
number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, this may be 
corrected by sending the room number along with the telephone number to Notes 
Mail ID "Move-Team".

I think it starts off a bit too hot.  I would pull up some of the arguments 
you make about the need for additional supply and the importance of 
electricity to our way of life.  I'd then go into a discussion of the debacle 
in the West (and how they are now playing catchup - with loud, polluting 
diesel generators ... as was reported today).  Then I'd go into how our 
plants in Florida represent a very reasonable, inobtrusive solution for 
Florida.

Subject: DRAFT EDITORIAL: Enron is Committed to Florida's Energy Future

In support of of our three power plant proposals in South Florida, I have 
written an editorial for distribution to South Florida newspapers, including 
the Sun Sentinel and Miami Herald.  Additionally, we would distribute it to a 
number of small city papers, including the Pompano Pelican, Deerfield Times, 
Pompano Times, Deerfield Observer, etc.

Needless to say, no decision has been made regarding releasing it.  I would 
like your input on the subject.  If we decide to proceed, our goal would be 
placement during the first week in June leading up to the next round of 
Commission hearings, which are scheduled for June 6, 8 and 12.

Please provide comments to me at your earliest convenience.  If you have any 
questions, please call me at ext. 3-9053.

Thanks.

Eric

Is there anything we can tell them about the rates they should expect from 
the utility?  I think that will be the biggest concern and we can reduce 
backlash if we can provide them some information.

I have been trying to hook up with Kevin and will see him tomorrow.  I still 
prefer to use the "old exec committee plus" for this PRC with a reformed MD 
PRC starting at mid year.  We have too many people in transition to just 
switch over to the policy committee at this stage.

		 Subject: 

Following discussions with Steve and Kevin yesterday, we're providing some 
options for the conduct of final PRC reviews  for the Enron VP's and MD's.  
Please let us know which of these options (or a derivative therein) you'd 
prefer.  

For continuity through the year-end process, we might consider having the 
existing MD VP PRC Committee review the VP slate; and  the former EC and two 
newly appointed EC members  who are also VP PRC Committee, (John  Lavorato 
and Jeff Shankman were suggested), ratify the VP slate and review the 
MD's.    The newly appointed EC members who are MD level will remain in the 
"Not Rated" category, so that Jeff and John may participate in the overall 
discussion and depart before discussions relative to them and their EC 
colleagues.      

Alternatively, we might disband the existing MD VP PRC Committee in favor of 
having the newly appointed EC  (13  of whom are MD VP PRC) review the VP 
slate.  Thereafter, the Enron Corporate Policy Committee would be responsible 
for ratifying these results and for reviewing the MD's slate.  Insofar as the 
Policy Committee might require further  information on individual MD's, 
selected EC members could be invited for an appropriate period of time to 
provide the necessary details.   

If we opt to disband the existing MD VP PRC we'd need to notify those members 
who aren't part of the new EC that their services are no longer required.  In 
so much as some of these people are currently assigned to, and attending, BU 
and functional pre-rankings clearly the sooner we are able to do this, the 
better.

Your immediate attention to this issue would be greatly appreciated, since we 
are eager to begin the year-end VP/MD PRC planning process.  Thanks in 
advance,

Gina Corteselli

Attached for your review and comments is the second group of recommended 
practices worked on by the UBP group.  The Suppliers that have participated 
in the UBP plan to submit joint comments to this report and I would like to 
be able to incorporate any comments that individuals in Enron's State 
Government Affairs Group may have into the overall Supplier comments.  In 
order to meet the deadline for comments, I need to receive your comments no 
later than noon, August 28th.  The best way to submit these comments is by 
red-lining the actual document.  

You can also review and download the entire UBP report, including the 
finalized chapters and the chapters "out for comments", on 
http://www.ubpnet.org/workshop/download.htm.

Please feel free to contact me (712-366-3399 or pager 888-912-1426) if you 
have any questions.  Thanks for your time and consideration.

See attached WSJ article, particularly the last paragraph.  The message is: 
there has not been enough deregulation;  the government is still very much in 
the way.  California is a perfect example:  the market has responded to 
demand increases with thousands of megawatts of new generation, but state and 
local officials have not sited them, and companies like Enron are offering 
price protection, but utilities are not allowed to take advantage.

Attached is an article about deregulation, price volatility, California power 
issues and how EES and other energy management type of companies are helping 
with solve these problems. 



Attached is an article about how PG&E is offering incentives to its larger 
customers in California that which asks them to use less energy, in turn the 
customers are guaranteed to be blackout free. There is a little controversy 
over this issue because the incentive is not offered to small business or 
residents.

My message was sent before I finished it.
I think it would be interesting to focus your attention on this interplay  
--  what policy changes have meant to companies (ie the winners and losers) 
and how explicit companies are about how government policy drives their 
business strategy in these industries.  I also think it would be fascinating 
to compare regulators' visions for the industry they are restructuring with 
the reality after the fact.  I believe you would find some similarities but 
also some substantial and interesting differences.
Good luck with your studies.
My best regards to Mike; I learned a great deal working for him.

Steve,
Vince Kaminski suggested I contact you, I'm the Gov't Affairs rep for NNG in 
Omaha and begin a doctoral studies program this fall at NU. I plan a research 
emphasis in regulatory politics, specific to energy and telecom market 
convergence and the public interest. I'd welcome any advice or suggestions

Steve, Kevin Garland sent this to me hoping to get Jeff's approval to send it 
out from the office of the chairman.  Would it make sense to incorporate it 
into the memo you're working on?  Please advise.  Thanks, SRS

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Special Asset Group will also become part of Enron Principal Investments.  
The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work with all the 
business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage equity investments, 
which leverage Enron's unique and proprietary knowledge.   These investments 
may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, traditional private equity and 
distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director, overseeing all activities of 
Enron Principal Investments.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Dick Lydecker, 
and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form Enron Principal 
Investments.  This new business unit will report to an investment committee, 
consisting of Greg Whalley, Ken Rice and Dave Delainey. 

 Please join me in congratulating and supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Dick 
and the other members of this group in this effort.

Jeff Skilling

The following illustrious FERC group will be with us on 31 the morning of 
Dec. 7.  They have asked to have a demonstration in detail of EPMI's systems 
that track OASIS and market information.  Many of them have not seen EOL, so 
we need to show them that as well.

The fact that this group is made up of so many FERC office directors means 
that this visit comes at the request of the Chairman Hoecker.  They will be 
visiting Dynegy and El Paso later that day.

They are definitely interested in a good presentation from Enron, as we have 
given them in the past -- primarily because they met so many senior Enron 
executives.  It would be great if Dave Delainey or John Lavorato could also 
come by to meet them.

Thanks.

Subject: Gov Geringer meeting

Steve/RIck ---as you may be aware, Governor Geringer personally asked Ken Lay 
to come to the kick off meeting of the Wyoming Energy Task Force, a group 
that was created by legislative mandate last month.  The meeting is on May 
30th in Cheyenne.  Mr. Lay told the Governor that he would not be able to 
make it on that date, but promised that a senior Enron exectutive would be 
there.  I spoke with Governor Geringer's staff person again this past week 
and was hoping that Paul Kaufman could be the senior executive, but no such 
luck (unless you give Paul a huge new title!).  

In talking with Maureen I understand that you have a previous conflict Steve, 
but I am hoping that you can review your calendar to see if you could make an 
adjustment in order to meet the request of the Governor.  Your speech would 
be in the morning--I've been told about 9 o clock or so---which would allow 
for you to leave by noonish.

Steve,

Attached is information about a conference sponsored by the Association of 
Energy Services Professionals International (AESP) taking place this August.  
We received a request for an EES Executive speaker for the Symposium, but 
felt that it would be more appropriate for an Executive from Corporate to 
consider speaking here.  There are Executives from companies such as The New 
Power Company, Cinergy and Entergy committed to speaking at the event.  More 
information can be found in the document below.

Please let me know if you have questions or comments.

Thank you,
Amy Buehler

Steve, 

As mentioned in my voice mail, attached is the email from SHRM about the 
proposed amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act.  I believe that this 
legislation would be helpful to Enron.  Let me know if I can do anything to 
help.

Thanks.  Michelle

HHRMA members Lori Thomas and Lane Transou shared findings from the
Legislative Action Committee's FLSA-bonus survey (presented at September's
meeting) last Friday in Washington, D.C. with representatives of several
influential members of Congress. Pending legislation (sponsored in part by
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison) would permit non-exempt employees to participate
in bonus programs without employers having to recalculate overtime rates.

Congress is ready to act. President Clinton may be willing to sign. We need
your help.

Please consider calling/e-mailing members of both houses, especially Phil
Gramm, Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-IL), and Houston area Congresspersons Ken
Bentsen, Bill Archer, Sheila Jackson Lee, Nick Lampson, Tom DeLay, Kevin
Brady, and Gene Green.

Subject: help with neighborhood

Steve,

I am having a problem with the drainage in our easements in my neighborhood 
and Kevin Hannon suggested I email you.  I live in Garden Oaks (which is 
located off of the 610 North Loop between Shepherd and Yale near the 
Heights).  Our neighborhood was built in the early 1940's, and the city put 
in open drainage (which is basically ditches in the front of all the 
properties).  Over the past 60 years the drains have filled in and leveled 
which is preventing the water from flowing correctly to the sewers, and this 
in turn causes minor flooding and BIG headaches.  

My address is 236 W. 30th Street and the area of 30th Street I am asking the 
city to regrade is between Ashland and Yale (approximately 2,500 feet).  I 
have been calling the City of Houston Public Works Department 713-247-1000 
for about the last 4 years (generally once a month) to ask them to please 
come out and regrade our ditches.  (The Public Works Department only has 
records over the last year because they changed their computer system and 
lost many files including mine.)  For the last year or so I have been 
receiving a more positive response when I call which is: "This is a Code 1 
priority and will schedule as work load allows."  Although this response is 
encouraging, I still feel that my request is falling on deaf ears.  

Kevin suggested that perhaps a call or letter to a city council person might 
help expedite this work request.  I would be extremely grateful if there is 
anything you could do to help me and my neighbors.

Steve: I understand that you are considering a $3,500 Enron PAC contribution 
to Congresswoman Shiela Jackson Lee. Chris and Citigroup co-hosted an event 
for Shiela last August in Washington which raised $17,000. Additionally, 
Enron PAC contributed $1,500 for her primary race (she had no race) and 
$1,000 for the general election. Her opposition is nominal. We have also 
handled various personal requests for her such as tickets to Enron Field. 

She has been helpful on several issues this year such as H1-B Visa and was in 
India with President Clinton at which she spoke to the Power Minister in a 
helpful way. Ken Lay and others jawboned her to get her vote in favor of PNTR 
for China although I think she was bargaining with everyone as she frequently 
does. Chris Long has developed a good relationship with Shiela but she seldom 
seeks us out and I think her "delayed" position on PNTR for China was 
unbecoming a representative from Houston. Houston will gain from PNTR for 
China. 

I would recommend a maximum of $2,000 to go along with our recommendation 
that she be more attentive to our positions on leading issues. 

Joe

the 17 women members that were there are of importance to us.

Subject: Re: pipeline aftermath  

Clayton:

Here are some preliminary answers to your questions (and I have copied GPG 
and Government Affairs folks as well to share this information):  

1)  I am currently assessing the situation regarding pipeline safety 
legislation.  This week has been very quiet on Capitol Hill as all of the 
members are back in the states on August recess running for re-election and 
it is a big vacation week for staff...but here's what I am hearing:

As you may or may not know, we have been been very active this year trying to 
temper pipeline safety legislation that was fairly reactionary in the wake of 
last summer's liquid pipeline accident in Bellingham, WA.   

SENATE:  In June, Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Slade Gorton (R-WA) led the 
charge to pass a pipeline safety bill (S. 2438) out of the Senate Commerce 
Committee, and that bill is awaiting floor action in the Senate.   Because of 
the hasty way in which S. 2438 was drafted and passed, there was a 
realization by both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate that the bill 
could not make it to the floor for a vote until some serious changes were 
made -- mostly things that were deal breakers for industry.  Enron and El 
Paso were leading the charge and we had a number of Senators backing our 
efforts to negotiate changes, including Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-MS), 
Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), John Breaux (D-LA), and Sam Brownback (R-KS).   
>From what I've learned since the accident, these Senators are not changing 
their strategy and are still asking for the same improvements.  Fortunately, 
most of the changes we were looking to make were fairly technical and not the 
types of things that would be seriously compromised by the accident.   
Industy was already in the position of having to accept a number of things 
they never would have if not for he Bellingham incident...the El Paso 
incident just reinforces those.   The biggest potential effect I see from the 
El Paso accident is an increased effort to pass something before the Congress 
adjourns in early October.  The New Mexico Senators are already calling for a 
floor vote on the McCain/Gorton legislation, and I there will certainly be 
greater pressure on leaders to wrap up negotiations, get agreement from all 
sides on a bill, and move it unanimously through a vote on the Senate floor.

HOUSE:   The House is moving a bit more slowly, but again, I'd expect the El 
Paso situation to expedite things somewhat.  There were several bills 
introduced in the House that were not moving anywhere, including an identical 
copy of the McCain legislation introduced by Rep. Bob Franks (R-NJ).  Franks 
is now anxious to move legislation, as he is running for Senate and would 
love to take credit for helping out on an issue of national visibility.   
Before the accident, House Tranportation Committee leaders on both the 
Democrat and Republican side were working on a "consensus" bill that they 
could introduce in early September and move quickly through the Committee and 
to the House floor.   I'm told that negotiations on that legislation are 
moving forward and a draft bill will be produced shortly.  Unlike our 
experience in the Senate, we have had significant input into the bill in 
advance, and expect something that we can live with -- and something more 
reasonable than the McCain bill.   With that said, there may be an effort to 
expand the bill in a few areas because of the El Paso accident, so we'll have 
to see what kind of hand we're dealt in the next few weeks.  

Overall, I'd expect pipeline safety legislation to be given higher priority 
when Congress returns after Labor Day.  In the absence of this accident, I 
would have given it slim odds of passing in the few short weeks until 
adjournment, with appropriations bills taking up most of Congress' precious 
time.   Now there will be greater pressure to come to consensus and move 
bills through by an expedited process, so that everyone running for election 
in November can show that they've done something about this terrible 
tragedy.   With that said, there's still not that much time to get 
legislation through, so I'd say that there's still a chance it may not get 
done this year.   If I had to attach a number to it, I'd say that the El Paso 
accident improves the chances of legislation going all the way to probably 
50-60%.

2)  Gas supply to California:   I'll have to do some more checking in this 
area and get back to you.   All I've heard so far is that the safety 
questions that remain may slow the speed of restarting flow on the line, 
notwithstanding that El Paso thinks it can have things running again fairly 
quickly.   I'm sure the power crunch in California will put some 
counter-pressure on, but I just don't have good intelligence on this yet.

With all this said, I'm on vacation this week and parts of next week 
finishing up some leave I've taken for the birth of our new baby daughter, so 
I may not have an additional report for you until early to mid next week.

If you have questions, please respond by e-mail, or leave a message on my 
voice mail at 202-466-9157.

Regards,

Jeff Keeler

Hi Cynthia:

The commercial officers here are very concerned with the El Paso pipeline 
explosion in New Mexico.  We would love to get some input from your group on 
the following questions if possible:

1.  What is the status of pipeline safety legislation on the Hill, and what 
is the outlook for action between now and the end of the year?

2.  What are people from California saying about the added pressure on gas 
supplies, and what are people from New Mexico saying about restarting the 
flow of gas while safety questions remain?

These questions come straight from the top, and any information you could 
provide would be very helpful.  Please write me back or call and let me know 
if/when you think we might be able to get some initial answers.

Thanks very much!

Clay

Thanks for the resume.  I don't see a fit in government affairs, but I am 
forwarding to community relations to see if there is any interest there.

Steve,  

Ned Higgins fowarded this to me.  Evidently Kara's fiance is former ECT and 
has just moved to KMI.  She has responded to the TW job posting, but she 
might be a better fit somewhere else.  Thought you might want to look over 
the resume.

		 Subject: US Visit for GoodCorporation

Dear Steven

I know Michael Zilkha has written to you already but I wanted to thank you
too for the time you spent with us last Friday and the very valuable
insights you gave us. I hope that I have given you most of the information
you need to understand our concept and to be able to discuss it with your
colleagues. We agreed that on my return to the UK I would set out how Enron
might be involved at this stage and be one of the first US firms to pioneer
the idea and become a GoodCorporation network member able to display the
GoodCorporation trademark and start conversing with other members. Those
members could be private companies, public sector entities or government
departments, trade associations, NGOs etc.

As we discussed the GoodCorporation Charter and processes are near
completion . We are in the process of starting our pilot verifications which
will be done by PwC, KPMG, Ernst & Young, Intertek, SGS and Bureau
Veritas.We are also setting up an Accreditation Body ( which is being
modelled on the Forestry Stewardship Council)  to oversee the annual
verification process. 

The pilot programme provides companies with an excellent opportunity to have
a low risk way of trying out the process and seeing if it works in their
organisation. They can submit the whole or a small part of the organisation.
Pilot companies pay for the verifiers' time only and the verifiers are
giving their time at cost ($750/ day.) The pilot itself will take the form
of a preliminary scoping meeting in which the verifier will take the company
through the evidence (policies and procedures) that need to be in place in
order to pass the GoodCorporation charter. The meeting will decide who needs
to be interviewed, in which locations and therefore the number of days
involved. As the emphasis is on verifying policies and the way they are
implemented in the workplace rather than a full scale audit of impact, the
number of days involved should be relatively limited.  During the actual
verification, the verifier will check for the evidence by reviewing
documentation provided by the company, in addition to a series of meetings
with the relevant people, such as the HR Director, Environmental Manager,
Finance Directors and customer-facing staff. Assuming it is successful, the
piloted part of the company can then become a member of the network if they
so choose. 

It would be great to have Enron involved in this early piloting. Given your
current policies and ethics I wouild be surprised if the charter posed any
real problem for you . It could also be a useful supply chain tool for you
to encourage your suppliers not only to say they behave in the manner you
wish them to behave but also demonstrate this behaviour to you and the
outside world in a transparent fashion. Please get back to me if you require
any further clarification and of course I and my colleagues would be
delighted to meet whoever else you need to get involved before a decision is
made.

Again, many thanks for your time and I was delighted that you were
enthusiastic about our concept.

With very best regards

Vicky Pryce

Chairman, GoodCorporation

Steve,

Thanks for your courtesy this morning, and recommendations for further 
contacts.  (By copy of this transmission I'm sending my resume' on to Rick, 
Jose' and Miguel, as you suggested.)  Much of the work I've done in the last 
fifteen years has been involved government affairs, in one way or another.  
Either I was dealing with state and federal regulatory agencies in the US, 
working on political campaigns in Florida and Texas, or negotiating with 
international governments preparing for purchase of utility concessions.  All 
while developing strategy, building and organizing teams to execute the work, 
and seeing to it that the job got done.

Three documents are attached.  I suggest this order to read them: 
#1 "JPO Res Addendum" gives you a view looking forward (where I'll go, what I 
can do) as all resumes should.
#2 "JPO Res Exec Summ" gives you a view looking back (where I've been, what 
I've done) as all resumes would.
#3 "JPO Res Full CV" gives detail on specific assignments and projects 
(essentially an expanded version of #2).


Hope the holidays are joyous and safe for all.

Best regards,

J. Paul

Bill, we hit a home run this morning with HCAD.  They have agreed to take my 
reduced valuation on the Enron fleet.  A reduction of  $16,079,000 in taxable 
value.  This results in savings of $482,375.  That's not all, our allocation 
based on records for operations outside of the state of Texas resulted in 
additional savings of $1,559,638. Total savings to our 2000 budget will be 
$2,042,013.

The complaint,albeit brief, filed May 1 in San Diego Superior Court by 
Strategy Integration, Inc versus Michael Aguirre and the other Hendricks  
plaintiffs' attorneys is quite extraordinary in its disclosure. A hard copy 
is being faxed. The expert firm alleges they were "retained...to explain, 
research, and investigate potential claims of gaming and collusion by energy 
providers who supply electricity to the California Energy Market ...[and] 
...retained to perform utility and energy consulting services." After 
alleging that the Hendricks attorneys "refused to pay Plaintiffs' first 
billing"  it is alleged that"defendants' refusal may have resulted from the 
conclusions Plaintiff drew in its analysis." We should consider if there is 
there a way to get this filing to Senator Dunn's office or a more friendly 
Senator  without identifying us as the source,.They can see what some expert 
in the field  hired by the plaintiffs'  class action lawyers apparently 
concluded on their own about the claims of gaming and collusion. I suspect 
that  Sen Dunn has no interest but some Republican Senator might have some 
use for it. It could  have some value if the hearings go forward. This is not 
urgent timewise but I wanted to bring it to your attention.

Mark,

Congratulations on your new assignment.  It has been a long time since I have 
dealt with Coal but the business desperately needed new ideas and approaches 
when I knew it.  Good luck!

Yes, I did meet with JoAnn last Friday.  As required by the agreement she 
gave me, I have retained counsel and the proposal is being reviewed by my 
attorney.  In light of the announced change, I am wondering if questions and 
comments should still be addressed to you?  Please advise.

Mike D.

		 Subject: Natural Gas Price Increase

As discussed in last Friday's meeting on strategies related to higher energy 
prices, Harry asked me to develop the attached projection of delivered gas 
prices for this winter.

The projection is based upon EIA's monthly analysis of delivered gas prices 
for residential, commercial and industrial customers for selected states 
(Connecticut, Virginia, Illinois and Texas) for the 1999-2000 winter heating 
season (Nov-Mar).  Assuming pipeline and LDC mark-ups remain constant, the 
delivered prices were adjusted for the NYMEX Henry Hub projection of wellhead 
prices for the 2000-2001 winter period.  A national projection is also 
included.

Because the commodity portion of the gas bill for residential customers is a 
smaller percent of the total bill compared to commercial and industrial 
customers, the increase for residential customers will be less pronounced 
than for commercial or industrial customers.  In addition, LDC purchased gas 
cost mechanisms will moderate the effect of the price increase to some extent 
because monthly price increases are averaged out over an extended period (12 
months in some cases).  Furthermore, some state public utility commissions 
(e.g. Connecticut) are conducting meetings with LDCs to discuss looking for 
ways to lessen the impact of the projected increases. That being said, Nipsco 
recently announced residential prices are expected to increase 50-60% this 
winter over last winter (in line with the projection for Illinois).

If you are interested in a similar projection for other states, or have 
comments with respect to the above let me know.

Steve - Do you have a contact number for Ensign's campaign, and shall we call 
them to see if they still need the money for debt retirement?  They did cash 
the check we sent a month earlier for $2,000.

Joe,

As you are probably aware, Jim Hoecker is considering leaving FERC
relatively soon.  The President will then name a new Chairman.  Bill Massey
is quite interested in receiving the nomination.

Please call to discuss.

I think there is merit in pursuing this.  A couple of comments:

Dean Tyson:

It was a pleasure to see you again today. Phil, it was a pleasure to meet y=

and I look forward to working together.  Since time is of the essence, I=20
wanted to summarize where we left off at today=01,s meeting regarding Calif=

our arguments for adopting the approach that we discussed at today's meetin=
g.

 Given the fact that the legislative process is moving rapidly, bankruptcy =

appears that our window of opportunity is very small.  It seems that succes=

The chances of success are obviously limited, but I think that we agreed th=

all concerned have nothing to lose and everything to gain by taking a shot.=
=20
Your offer to help in the effort obviously increases the likelihood of=20
success and is greatly appreciated. =20

My apologies in advance if I have mischaracterized any of the points made a=
t=20
the meeting.  It represents a =01&first cut,=018 it will undoubtedly change=
 as the=20
details get worked out, and I=01,m sure I=01,ve missed something.  So pleas=
e don=01,t=20

Please keep in mind that I have not had a chance to discuss this proposal=

internally.  As such, I can=01,t yet commit Enron to the specifics of the=
=20
proposal.  But I=01,m confident that the company can support something akin=

this structure and can let you and Phil know first thing Monday.

In addition, given the political environment in California, Enron has playe=
d=20
a constructive role by providing low-key, behind the scenes advice and=20
analysis to policy makers.  That approach seems preferable in this effort a=

well.

Finally, Dean Tyson, I mentioned that Linda Robertson heads-up our Washingt=

Subject: United Way

I attended the kick off and coordinator committee meetings for UW today.  The 
"Who wants to help Millions" game begins next Wed. (7/19) via email.  I think 
Steve could encourage participation from his group with an email sent out 
Tues. 7/18 similar to this:


Subject:  Millionaire Game!

Want to have fun?  Want to get on a game show?  Want to help Millions?  
Tomorrow you will receive an email that allows you to answer 15 questions via 
email responses (about United Way, Enron, and other fun items).  
Participation with correct answers puts you in the drawing for the employees 
to represent Corp. in a "Who wants to be a Millionaire?" game that will be 
played to benefit United Way on August 9.  The lucky and smart 
representatives will be playing for great prizes.  I encourage your 
participation in the game, but more importantly, encourage your generous 
participation in Enron's United Way campaign.  Thanks for your help and HAVE 
FUN!



Other items:

Corp. will be sponsoring DePelchin Children's Center through Day of Caring 
and other activites during the year.  Other Enron business units will choose 
other UW agencies to sponsor through activities.  
We need to provide promotions/prizes for our group during the campaign.  Do 
we have Enron Field tickets, dinner at Ruggles at Enron Field, use of Steve's 
car, etc. that we could use for drawings a couple days after the kick off on 
August 9?  We could send emails to Steve's group encouraging them to get 
their pledge cards (now online) in early and draw from the early participants.

Guys, I have spoken to Cliff and Mark and we are comfortable moving forward 
under the structure we have discussed.

 FCEL: - $5MM in equity and 1.3MM warrants from corporate treasury stock that 
vest based upon 60MW of orders;
  - discussion with FCEL in which we disclose ALL infromation we have about 
the potential Conn. deal - I will require that myself and Mark be on   that 
call;
  - the transaction is fully press released immediately.

 CRRA: - subject to final due diligence on the development risks, we provide 
the management and wrap for CRRA on the potential fuel cell development   
opportunity that consists of between 25 and 50 MW;
  - any appropriation of funds from the government will require DPUC hearing 
at which we will fully disclose in a factual manner our interest in    FCEL.

I will require that Mark Haedicke manage this process and sign off on all 
press releases, term sheets, disclosure discussions, contracts and regulatory 
filings.  I believe that we have this managed appropriately as long as we 
manage the process as per the script and in a factual manner.

Thanks
Delainey

Steve,

Thanks for forwarding.  Actually, Brian sent it to me on Monday, and I 
followed up with Ann and Barbara.  I have not spoken with Brian yet because I 
am waiting for a green/red light from Barbara as far as Jade Eaton is 
concerned.  Barbara and I spoke at length yesterday and she is concerned 
about the counterparty's reaction to a meeting with DOJ (even an informal 
one).  She plans to get back to me though with regard to whether they want me 
to get involved at this stage.  I spoke to Rick as well so he is up-to-date 
with the current status.  

I'll let you know if anything further develops.  Thanks again.

Lara

PLEASE E-MAIL ALL BILLING ISSUES TO "CLIFFORD.JACKSON@ENRON.COM" OR TO THE 
SPECIFIC SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM(S) AS DETAILED BELOW:       Year 2000 changes:
Phone charges:  Phones are being charged to the person's company and cost 
center where possible, otherwise to the rent location.  The description will 
start with People\ or Room\ unless it was entered manually at the source.

Data connections:  One connection is being charged for each room instead of 
one connection for each port in a room.

Attached  are spreadsheets with the detail supporting the expenses for all 
the various services provided by Enron Information Services. 

EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, 
and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&T 
calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in 
EB, 2AC, 3AC, or JF.  For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by 
Tammy Anderson for this purpose.  

People-specific services are billed to the company and cost center 
corresponding to the employee's SAP company and department. Video conference 
usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings are based on 
a company and cost center furnished by the resource using the service.

EIS bills services on a one month lag.  We take a snapshot of the Corporate 
Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha 
phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the SAP company and cost center 
for each employee.  This snapshot is taken about the 21st of each month for 
use as a source for billing information.  

Please examine these billings for accuracy.  If the billings are incorrect, 
generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting 
Corporate Administrative Services or the person should be moved to the 
correct SAP department by contacting the HR representative.  If the room 
number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, this may be 
corrected by sending the room number along with the telephone number to Notes 
Mail ID "Move-Team".

I share your perceptions of Jose, though I don't have as much contact as you 
do.  I know also from some recent discussions with Rick (who has also had a 
fair amount of contact with Jose) that he has very positive views on Jose's 
work.  I think we should make a concerted effort to get the feedback and have 
a good discussion about Jose at year end to ensure that he is properly ranked.

This is a good summary of the scope of Jose's responsibilities and the value 
he manages.  This obviously takes a lot of my time as well because of its 
importance, in some ways  like you or Stan Horton, in terms of drivers of my 
P&L.  However, Jose manages this pretty much on his own without much 
involvement from Houston (it is a local effort by its nature), which was the 
point I was making at the PRC.  He has a good grasp of the commercial, 
regulatory and political elements of all of this and keeps them all balanced 
well.  He is methodical and systematic (which can also be perceived as not 
especially dynamic), and English is really his second language, which may 
have hurt him in the PRC.  He is on the job I would wager as much as 80 hours 
a week.  Do we have anyone at his level with as much or more responsibility 
elsewhere in the company?

ON THE GRID OR OFF THE GRID
Bigger Is Better
An interstate electricity highway could leverage economies of scale to keep 
the lights on Burton A. Weisbrod, Glen E. Weisbrod
Sunday,?February 25, 2001 
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle 
URL: 
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/02/25/S
C177059.DTL 
WE COULD HAVE left it to the states. When the Interstate Highway System was 
proposed nearly 50 years ago, we could have said, "Leave it to each state to 
decide on its roads and to pay for them, or leave it to private enterprise to 
build toll roads wherever it is profitable." Fortunately, we didn't. 
Today, vehicles can travel throughout the country on a system of integrated 
high-capacity roads that crisscross the nation. There are many differences 
between the flow of cars or trucks and the flow of electricity. But just as 
the Interstate Highway System ushered in a new era of easier movement of 
people and goods across the states, allowing enormous economic and social 
gains, so, too, do we now need to overcome the obstacles to the easy flow of 
power across state lines. 
Many forces are at work contributing to California's electricity crises, and 
power shortages in other parts of the country also are quite possible. The 
growth of population and industry in California has expanded demand for 
electricity. Legislative constraints, reflecting environmental protection and 
other concerns, have discouraged construction of electricity-generating 
plants. 
Periodic shutdowns of generation plants for maintenance have caused short- 
term power shortages. And, in an oddity of California law, the prices that 
power producers can charge distributors are deregulated, while the prices 
that those distributors can charge consumers are regulated and restricted. 
But largely missing from the debate of what can be done to balance supply and 
demand is discussion of an effective national power grid that would permit 
substantial amounts of electricity to flow, as highway traffic does, from one 
state to another. 
Interstate transmission connections do exist now, but are limited in 
capacity. They were primarily designed to meet temporary needs associated 
with local power emergencies, not for sustained use. If those interstate 
lines were upgraded to greater capacity, then we could move toward actually 
creating a national power grid. 
An effective national power grid could result in far more competition among 
producers of electric power across the nation, and far more options to meet 
demand in any local area. No state or region would need to depend simply on a 
small number of generating producers within its borders, and the increased 
number of interstate competitors would bring greater assurance of supply and 
lower prices. 
The underlying problem is basically one of incentives. With the maze of 
state, and federal regulations on the production, distribution and pricing of 
electricity, there is great risk and little incentive for private 
construction of costly transmission lines that cross multiple state borders. 
Imagine a power plant in state A, but near state B, with that plant 
occasionally having excess production capacity. There is no market for the 
power in state B, but there is demand for it in state C, which is adjacent to 
it. In a smoothly functioning, efficient, power transmission system, power 
would move from the generating plant in state A, across the border for use in 
state B, thereby permitting deals so that power produced in that area could 
be sent to state C. Through such a domino-like process, power available in 
one region effectively can help alleviate a shortage in another area - with 
only a series of relatively short-distance transmissions. 
Development of such an integrated electricity transmission network is what 
the federal government can and should foster. It would strengthen the nation; 
it would expand options for users; it would increase competition among 
suppliers, to the benefit of consumers; it would overcome the multiplicity of 
state regulations that have the effect of restricting incentives for 
profitable interstate power transmission. 
The Interstate Highway System did not solve all the problems of the nation's 
escalating population of cars, and it was not cheap. But, designed to 
maximize interconnections between metropolitan areas, with ample systemwide 
capacity to spare, it did transform the country, binding the 48 contiguous 
states into an integrated whole. 
The effect: reduced costs and increased "exports" of California fruits and 
vegetables to the Midwest, and reduced costs, along with increased exports of 
Midwest manufactured products to the West. 
Just as it does not make sense for every state to act like a separate 
country, building roads just for its own residents, or growing all of its own 
food supply, it is equally inefficient for each state to independently 
develop its own power supply. It is foolish to find electricity producers in 
one state claiming that they should not "help out" consumers in another 
state. 
A nationwide system would take better advantage of differential electricity 
demand in various parts of the country, seasonally and even in the course of 
a day. 
To consumers and industrial users in California, the effects of a national 
electricity transmission grid would be real and enduring, but not 
spectacular. It would, however, go far to achieving the quiet result that 
every consumer seeks - lower prices, more reliable electric power supplies. 
There is no single solution to California's energy crisis, but developing a 
national interstate electricity highway system would go far toward addressing 
it. Local power distribution within a state would remain a matter of state 
control. The federal government's role would be largely to provide financial 
incentives for constructing additional interstate transmission capacity, and 
to establish standards for its design and utilization - just as is the case 
with the Interstate Highway System. 
A survey of history and government professors conducted by the Brookings 
Institution last year identified the Interstate Highway System as one of the 
Top Seven governmental achievements of the last 50 years - along with 
rebuilding Europe after World War II and expanding the right to vote. An 
interstate electricity highway system could well be among the top 
achievements of government in the next half-century. 
MACRO POWER TRANSMISSION
WE HAVE AN ELECTRIC power crisis in California. In fact, we have two 
problems: a short-term problem and a long-term problem. 
Short term, the problem, from the consumer perspective, is: 
-- Soaring electricity bills. 
-- Fear of paying the mounting debts being incurred by electricity 
distributors such as Pacific Gas and Electric Co. either in rate increases or 
higher taxes. 
-- The threat, and to some users the reality, of no lights, no refrigeration, 
no heat. 
These concerns are real and severe. But they are merely symptoms of a serious 
long-term crisis: Incentives to the power industry are wrong! 
As Adam Smith reminded us over two centuries ago, we do not look to the good 
intentions of sellers to get them to serve the public interest; we look to 
their self interest. Then, as today, wise public policy calls for aligning 
the two, by providing incentives for the development of an electricity system 
that provides power that is dependable, is produced efficiently and is 
distributed competitively, so that prices are low. 
This long-term problem will not be solved by the series of Band-Aids that 
governmental officials and power producers and distributors are skirmishing 
over. Now is the time to develop a long-term plan. 
Two elements of a long-term plan for efficient and reliable electricity are 
clear: 
-- Electricity self-sufficiency for each state is bad policy. It is easy to 
think that dependency on power imports from other states is a root problem. 
It is not. Trade and competition mean access to more producers, and that can 
bring efficiency in electricity no less than in food, electronics or autos, 
as low-cost sources are utilized. (Promoting more interstate options does not 
preclude building more local generation, and small, "micro" electricity 
generating units do have a role as part of an overall electricity policy. 
However, the advantage of their flexibility must be balanced against their 
generally higher cost for meeting predictable long-term demand.) 
-- Incentives are needed to encourage investment in electricity transmission. 
It does no good to have low-cost power production unless the power can reach 
users. This is why the federal government has such an important role to play 
in financially encouraging and supporting a national interstate power highway 
system.

Governor Calls for 10% Cut In Usage
On national TV, Davis increases goal on energy 
Tanya Schevitz, Chronicle Staff Writer
Monday,?February 26, 2001

N44189.DTL 
Signaling a greater urgency in California's power crisis, Gov. Gray Davis 
said yesterday that keeping the lights and air conditioners running this 
summer will require every Californian to reduce electricity usage by about 10 
percent. 
In addition, he said, the state must get more electrical power online by 
then. 
His call for a 10 percent cut is a significant jump from the 7 percent he was 
asking for during his State of the State speech last month, and it may be a 
difficult stretch for consumers. Davis made his remarks on NBC's news show 
"Meet the Press." 
State Sen. Don Perata, D-Oakland, praised the governor's statement on 
national television. 
"The most important thing right now is that the governor said that, because 
there has been general skepticism statewide, reflected both in anecdotes and 
public opinion polls, that we are in fact facing a crisis," Perata said. "If 
you don't believe, you won't conform, you won't respond." 
But, he said, Davis will not get the conservation he wants unless consumers 
are given financial incentives. Perata said he will propose legislation today 
to give $1 billion to customers who cut down on their electricity use during 
the summer months. 
Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at the University of 
California at Berkeley, said if temperatures soar this summer, it will take a 
"huge effort" to keep the state at safe electricity levels. 
NEED FOR CONSERVATION
"We are in big trouble," Borenstein said. "That doesn't mean we can't avoid 
blackouts -- that means we will have to take serious measures." 
The needed steps include instituting variable prices for commercial and 
industrial users that reflect the supply and demand at any given hour and 
hooking up air conditioners to cycling systems, he said. For residential 
users, 
he said, it will mean increases for use above a certain level. 
Forecasters predict a shortfall of at least 5,000 megawatts this summer, but 
the state got some good news Thursday when the California Independent System 
Operator, which coordinates the flow of electricity through the state's power 
grid, removed all power alerts for the first time in more than a month. 
Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman for the California ISO, said that she does not 
expect any changes today but that it is too early to make any predictions 
about the summer power situation. 
"We still need to check the snowpack and the hills and the hydro situation in 
the state," O'Donley said. "Conservation is a big part of it, and whatever 
people can do to step up their conservation efforts will be a huge factor in 
avoiding blackouts." 
GOVERNOR DODGES BLAME
Davis appeared on "Meet the Press" while visiting Washington, D.C., for a 
meeting of the National Governors Association and a concurrent meeting of the 
Democratic Governors Association, which he chairs. With him on the program 
were Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., and Republican 
Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas. 
Davis took the opportunity of the high-profile television show to tell East 
Coast decisionmakers and Wall Street analysts that the blame for the state's 
energy crisis does not lie with him and to reassure them that he is taking 
solid steps to resolve the problem. 
"Both President Bush and I inherited California, a flawed deregulation 
system," he said during the broadcast. "Secondly, no major plant has been 
built in California prior to my governorship for 12 years." 
He outlined some solutions, including the approval of nine new power plants, 
with six under construction and three expected to be online this summer, and 
14 more in the pipeline. 
In a slip of the tongue, Davis said on yesterday morning's broadcast that 
consumers would need to cut electricity use to only 10 percent of last year. 
"It will require every Californian using about 10 percent of the electricity 
than they did the year before and a little luck in getting some extra 
megawatts on line this summer," Davis said. 
What he meant, a spokesman said, was they had to cut use by 10 percent. 
Still, that will require significant sacrifice. 
In addition, Davis has said that he wants to add 5,000 megawatts of power -- 
enough for 5 million homes -- by summer. He has promised to speed up the 
approval process and provide bonuses to builders who finish before July. 
The state also established an $800 million conservation program this year. 
But Borenstein said that many of the ideas floating around for spending the 
conservation money are for efforts that would not help for about another 
three years. 
ON NATIONAL MATTERS
During yesterday's show, Davis also weighed in on President Bush's tax-cut 
proposal and former President Bill Clinton's controversial last-minute 
pardons. 
The administration should wait for a tax cut until the money is available, he 
said. 
"All of us who have been in government for a while have seen the roller- 
coaster ride of surpluses and then shortages and surpluses and shortages," he 
said. "Clearly, people need tax relief, but it should be moderated to the 
point where we don't kill the golden goose, which is a strong, growing 
economy. " 
Although he received a significant campaign donation from the father of 
Carlos Vignali, the Los Angeles drug kingpin, Davis told show host Tim 
Russert that he never spoke with the family about the presidential pardon 
Vignali received on Clinton's last day in office. 
Davis said he did not have enough information to know whether the pardon was 
a mistake, but, he said, "there's something about them in general that 
doesn't ring right." 
"However," he said, "people expect us to focus on things that matter to them, 
and they really want to see progress on education, the environment, tax 
relief, health care." 
Asked by Russert whether he is going to run for president in 2004, Davis did 
not rule it out but said that only re-election to the governorship in 2002 is 
on his horizon. 
"I'm focused on keeping the lights on and making our schools better," he 
said.

Thanks for the message.  I agree that once we have a good outline of what we 
are going to do we are going to need someone who can get it done.  I think 
you would be an outstanding candidate for that role (seems to me we went 
after you once before).  Is your inquiry confidential or can I discuss it 
with others?

Steve,

Thank you for taking the time to see me whenever I have requested an 
appointment with you. I believe there are discussions to consolidate Enron 
websites and also to develop a Knowledge Management infrastructure.  You and 
I have shared some thoughts on these subjects. Properly managed, these are 
potent tools in the strategic mix that would help keep Enron innovative. I 
know that no concrete plans have yet emerged from your deliberations but I 
can foresee when you might want someone to lead this effort full time.

It is eminently sensible to move towards consolidation in both areas. Among 
the several benefits, a common infrastructure would sharply reduce both 
development and maintenance costs.  Also, we would eliminate duplications and 
give coherence to the look and feel of websites that would emphasize 
corporate branding.  

I am doing some great things here at EBS and generally speaking I am happy. 
Nevertheless, I see a tremendous potential in this role and very much would 
like to be considered a prime candidate for the lead position in this effort. 
Everything I have done here at Enron has richly prepared me for this 
position. My relationship with business units has given me a unique 
education.  I have developed information value chain, built and managed three 
websites in three different operating companies. At all times my products 
were considered benchmarks. In addition, I shall be able to manage potential 
political problems that are likely to attend any consolidation. 

I should be grateful if you would think about this. 

Once again, thank you for your time.

Dear Steven:

Just to refresh your memory ... we met in June to discuss future job
prospects at Enron.  At that time, you had offered to get me in touch with
someone in the Finance Division (?) at Enron to discuss similar topics.  I
am sorry to bother you with matters such as this, but I am still very
interested in a position with Enron and would like to follow through on
this offer, if you are still willing.  As an aside, another contact gave
me the name of Rob Bradley and suggested that I get in touch with him.  I
don't know if that is who you had in mind, or not.

I am moving my wife to Houston next week, and will be available to meet
any time from Friday, August 4 until Thursday, August 10.  After that, I
leave for a conference in Seattle, but will back in Houston for one day on
Thursday, August 17th.

As for my timetable (which at the time you had told me to keep you
apprised of), I will continue in my position at K-State for the Fall
semester.  After that, I'm a free man.  I have a couple of academic offers
for temporary positions in the Spring, one at Rice and one at UT-Austin.
The latter is very appealing, but would require my absence from home
during the weeks.  As such, I am still wide open beginning in January.

In spite of the fact that I awoke at 3:30AM in order to get to the
airport the day that I met Jim Steffes and you, I got a lot out of our
meeting.  I was very impressed with Enron and what you had to say, and am
hopeful about future prospects with the company.  I remain very interested
in a future position at Enron, and perhaps in Public and Government
Affairs (I hope I have that right).

Thank you for everything.  I hope that you had a nice vacation.

Sincerely,

Mike Sadler

????????ON THE EXERCISE OF MARKET POWER THROUGH
STRATEGIC WITHHOLDING IN CALIFORNIA
Scott Harvey and William W. Hogan
April 24, 2001

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Beginning in June of 2000, the shock of unexpectedly high prices in the=20
California electricity market convinced everyone of the need for policies t=
o=20
correct the apparent market failures.? The public debate and policy=20
discussions have been dominated by a focus on market power as a principal=
=20
problem amenable to regulatory solution.? However, design of effective=20
policies to moderate prices or mitigate their effects depends on the=20
diagnosis of the underlying causes.? High prices attributable largely to an=
=20
exercise of market power in electric generation would point to particular=
=20
market participants and behaviors that could be targeted for regulatory=20
action.? By contrast, high prices attributable to bad electricity market=20
design would indicate a need for changes in the design.? High prices=20
attributable to higher fuel prices, environmental constraints and capacity=
=20
shortages, on the other hand, would prompt actions to address the cost of=
=20
fuel and environmental limitations and indicate that retail loads should=20
receive the appropriate price signal for conservation.

Suppliers could affect market prices by strategically withholding some=20
capacity in order to profit on the capacity actually sold in the market.? B=
ut=20
charging high prices during periods of scarcity is not classified as=20
exercising market power if there is no strategic withholding of supply.?=20
Likewise, refusing to supply without being paid is not an exercise of marke=
t=20
power.? Although the potential for withholding exists for many suppliers, t=
he=20
focus of attention has been on the exercise of market power by thermal=20
generators in California.

On its face, the experience of extremely high prices suggests that the=20
exercise of market power could be important.? But at the same time the data=
=20
show that there have been profound changes in the California market such th=
at=20
the thermal generators have actually increased their production more than=
=20
demand has grown.? If anything, thermal generators that hit annual output=
=20
limits produced too much rather than too little in the summer of 2000.?=20
Furthermore, the widespread impacts of higher electricity prices throughout=
=20
the western market, both on and off peak,? indicate that if the exercise of=
=20
market power is important it is occurring to an extent and through channels=
=20
unprecedented in this or other electricity markets.? In short, this is a=20
complicated story, and there is ample room for further investigation of the=
=20
data and diagnosis of causes.

Examination of the major analyses of the exercise of market power reveals=
=20
that the estimated magnitude of the possible strategic withholding of=20
electric generation is small enough to make it important to verify the=20
simplifying assumptions.? If strategic withholding were large and pervasive=
,=20
then the real details of the California electricity market could be ignored=
.?=20
But it is by now apparent that the evidence is not clear, and any finding o=
f=20
the presence or absence of strategic withholding of generation in the=20
California electricity market could turn on the simplifying assumptions use=
d=20
in the analysis of the data.? For example, annual limits on production=20
dictate that plants should not run in many hours when prices are higher tha=
n=20
direct incremental costs; hence, examinations of output decisions for=20
individual hours or months are necessarily incomplete.? The variation in re=
al=20
time conditions is large enough to produce significant reductions in output=
=20
compared to the expectations given day-ahead prices; hence, with capacity=
=20
constraints average optimal production is necessarily less than optimal=20
production at average prices.? Limits on the ramping rate of generation=20
units, start-up costs, minimum load costs and other operational=20
inflexibilities imply that a dispatch day is not just twenty-four separate=
=20
hours and must be analyzed chronologically, recognizing these factors.? And=
=20
so on.? Accounting for such effects can reverse the implications of the=20
previous evidence.? Unfortunately, the real details are neither simple nor=
=20
incidental.

It is difficult to conduct a study of market power based solely on publicly=
=20
available data.? A fuller analysis would require data available only to the=
=20
California Independent System Operator, and has not been done.? Many factor=
s=20
contributed to higher electricity prices in California, and the market powe=
r=20
theme is only, at most, part of the story.? The import of the previous=20
analyses is not to prove that market power has been exercised in the=20
California electricity market but, rather, to suggest that it might be=20
important.? The import of the sensitivity analysis here is not to prove tha=
t=20
market power has not been exercised in the electricity market? but, rather,=
=20
to suggest that it is unlikely to be the dominant factor and may not even b=
e=20
significant.? With the available data in the public domain, and the special=
=20
complications introduced by the California market design, the margin of err=
or=20
in estimating the extent of the possible exercise of market power through=
=20
strategic withholding of electric generation is of the same order of=20
magnitude as the effect being measured.? On balance, to date the publicly=
=20
available data provides no reason for the Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission to change its conclusion that there is no evidence of strategic=
=20
withholding nor any proof that no strategic withholding has occurred.

By contrast, there is general agreement that the California electricity=20
market design is =01&seriously flawed.=018? Furthermore, there is evidence =
that the=20
policy responses that have been adopted in California have accelerated an=
=20
already serious market collapse.? Hence, without dismissing the possibility=
=20
of the exercise of market power, the principal policy focus should be on=20
fashioning workable solutions for the other more serious problems in market=
=20
design that relate to the underlying causes of the market meltdown.

Separate from market power mitigation, California should pay its bills, rai=
se=20
incremental prices to retail customers, and move as quickly as possible to=
=20
operating a coordinated and efficient market with consistent pricing for al=
l=20
that includes unit commitment, day-ahead scheduling, and real-time=20

problems and set the stage for longer-term initiatives to expand generation=

to the western interconnected grid.

I agree with Rick.  I know Jose is tied up on current business, but his input 
will be important.  To date we have been relying on legal analysis of 
required approvals etc.  That information is essential but it is, as you 
know, about 10% of the issue.  The far more critical considerations are how 
is the government likely to react on a political level and what can we do 
about it.  I think our government affairs people are in the best position to 
make these assessments.

I have reviewed the most recent IM and don't have any significant comments, 
but my review did highlight the need to have a set or sets of 
eyes(internally) who understand the regulatory overlay of the Southern Cone 
better and who are also in a better position  ( physically and with language 
skills ) to assess the  nature of the regulatory approvals needed and to 
effectively pull on a set of local resources when this project begins to take 
shape- With all of that in mind, I would recommend we , at the very least, 
bring Jose into the loop. I intend to stay actively engaged and do whatever I 
can, but we need help immediately on the regulatory front - the last thing I 
would want to have happen to the project would be have it held hostage at the 
governmental approval stage-  being proactive now by bringing Jose over the 
wall would be my strong recommendation.Please advise.

The senator's speech is focused on the oil sector almost exclusively, but it 
does an exceptional job of framing the importance of the issue.

I believe that you agreed at our last meeting that it might be well for you 
and me -- and Ken if available -- to discuss plans for this group in 2001. My 
feeling is that we should review its composition after the election -- we may 
lose Larry or want to add a Democrat (Laura Tyson?); we can take a hard look 
at who is contributing and who isn't etc.
My agenda would be:
1. What can be done to increase the value to Enron? As I see it we have two 
purposes: to create fans of and spokepersons for the company in important 
fora, and to enrich management's understanding of the outside world (what it 
is like, and how it views some of the problems that Enron faces).
2. What are the likely topics that it would be valuable for Enron to discuss 
in 2001, as best we can judge things at this early point in time? 
3. What should the composition of the group consist of in 2001, given 
whatever we decide in #1 and #2 above.
4. How can we maximize the chance of achieving Ken's objective of attracting 
outside guest speakers? Advance scheduling? Fees? And what sorts would we 
like to attract?
I am sure there are many other items; these are designed merely to start you 
thinking.
Let me start the bidding by suggesting November 29 or December 4, inn 
Washington if you happen to be in town, in Houston if that is more convenient.

Wisconsin Gas to Purchase Nine Mile Line From Northern Natural Gas

Line Will Enhance Competition in Southeast Wisconsin and Use Existing 
Facilities 

MILWAUKEE, July 13 /PRNewswire/ -- Wisconsin Gas, Northern Natural Gas and 
Guardian Pipeline announced today that Wisconsin Gas has signed an agreement 
with Northern Natural Gas (NNG) to purchase a nine mile, high pressure 
natural gas pipeline in Walworth and Waukesha counties. The purchase price is 
$5 million. The proposed transaction will require approval from federal and 
state regulators. The pipe, known as the Eagle line, is located southeast of 
the Kettle Moraine Forest near Eagle, Wis.
The existing line has been part of the NNG interstate transmission system. 
Under the new ownership, the line will become part of the Wisconsin Gas 
distribution system and will interconnect with Guardian Pipeline as well as 
the NNG system. 
"Northern Natural Gas is pleased to be a part of a creative, cost-effective 
solution to provide additional gas service to southeastern Wisconsin," said 
Dave Neubauer, vice president of business development and marketing, Northern 
Natural Gas. "This transaction enables Wisconsin Gas and its customers to 
obtain natural gas supplies from Guardian or NNG. Providing reliable, 
economical choices for consumers will benefit all of the parties involved." 
"We saw this as an opportunity to minimize environmental impact and still 
realize the benefits of increased competition in the natural gas market," 
said James Schott, senior vice president, Wisconsin Gas. "The purchase of the 
Eagle line will enable Wisconsin Gas to further our goal of providing 
cost-efficient natural gas service to our customers." 
As a result of the purchase Guardian Pipeline, the 141-mile interstate 
pipeline from Joliet, Ill. to Ixonia, Wis., will no longer build an 8.5-mile 
lateral to Eagle. The lateral was part of the originally certified Guardian 
Pipeline. This portion of the line would have generally run parallel to the 
current Northern Natural pipeline. 
"This sale is a win-win situation for Guardian and consumers," said George 
Hass, project manager of Guardian Pipeline. "The Eagle line purchase by 
Wisconsin Gas saves Guardian time and resources by taking away the need to 
build the 8.5-mile lateral and allows all three companies to create a better 
environment for competition in the natural gas marketplace." 
The existing gate stations at LaGrange and Eagle will remain in-service for 
regulation purposes. Odorization and measurement will take place at a new 
gate station that will be constructed at the interconnect with Guardian. This 
new gate station will be called the Bluff Creek station and will be located 
near Whitewater. The Bluff Creek gate station will be constructed during the 
construction of Guardian Pipeline. 
Northern Natural Gas, a subsidiary of Enron Corp., with a market area 
capacity of about 4.3 Bcf/d, provides natural gas transportation services to 
utility customers in the upper Midwestern United States through its 
approximately 16,000 miles of pipeline. 
Guardian Pipeline is a partnership of three Midwestern energy companies: CMS 
Energy, based in Dearborn, Mich.; Wisconsin Energy, headquartered in 
Milwaukee, Wis.; and Viking Gas Transmission Co., a wholly owned subsidiary 
of Xcel Energy Inc., and located in St. Paul, Minn. 
Wisconsin Electric-Wisconsin Gas, the principal utility subsidiary of 
Wisconsin Energy Corp. (NYSE: WEC), serves more than one million electric 
customers and more than 960,000 natural gas customers throughout Wisconsin

Commodities Review: LME Copper Hit By Another Stock Rise
By Mark Long and Steve McGrath
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

07/13/2001
Dow Jones Commodities Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Copper futures traded in London fell Friday, as a 
further influx of stocks into official warehouses put the copper market under 
pressure and dragged down the rest of the base metal complex. 
Three-month copper traded on the London Metal Exchange ended $6 down from 
Thursday's late kerb close at $1,554.50 a metric ton.
An increase of 7,475 tons of copper into LME warehouses Friday brought total 
stocks up to a 12-month high of 550,300 tons. This pressured prices in early 
trade down to test $1,550/ton support, although prices recovered slightly in 
later trade. 
Unconfirmed market talk said Enron is behind much of the week's stock rise, 
in an effort to ease nearby supply tightness and to alleviate the large short 
positions it is thought to have built up on the July-for-a-week spread, which 
is currently showing a $6-$8/ton backwardation. The July futures contract 
will switch over to cash Monday. 
Enron declined to comment on the market talk Friday. 
A backwardation is a pricing structure in which deliveries to be made in the 
near future are more expensive then those set for a more distant delivery. 
The opposite situation is called contango. 
"The spreads are still tight. The major longs are still reluctant to lend, 
with no signs of that (tightness) dissipated," said Kevin Norrish, an analyst 
with Barclays Capital in London. 
Dealers and analysts said they expect further stock increases next week. 
The entire base metals complex ignored Thursday's 237-point rally in the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average, dealers said. 
"Copper has been sensitive to moves in the stock market, but not this time," 
Norrish said. In fact, now it appears that base metals markets ignore 
equities markets when they rally, but follow stocks down when they slump, he 
added. 
European Grain Futures See Profit-Taking, But More Gains Expected 
European grain and oilseed futures were hit by a bout of profit-taking and 
pre-weekend position-squaring Friday, after rising to long-time highs, 
brokers said. 
However, world and domestic crop concerns, the strength of the dollar and 
general bullish sentiment will carry the markets to fresh highs short term, 
they said. 
On the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, the 
benchmark November feed wheat contract ended just 25 pence up at GBP82/ton, 
after hitting a new two-year high of GBP83/ton in early trade. 
Meanwhile, Matif November rapeseed futures fell EUR2.75 on the day to 
EUR265/ton, after hitting a three-year high of EUR271/ton in early trade. 
The U.K. wheat crop and the French rapeseed crop are forecast to be well down 
on last year, and wheat and canola crops in some other major producing 
countries are also expected to fall. 
Meanwhile, the strength of the dollar is allowing European grain and oilseed 
traders to up prices and still remain competitive against U.S. imports and 
dollar-denominated grains on the world market.

LME Base Metals: Copper Pressured Down By Stock Build

07/13/2001
Dow Jones Commodities Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- London Metal Exchange three-month copper ended Friday's 
late kerb lower compared with Thursday, pressured by another stock build, 
dealers said. 
(LME three-month metals prices in dollars a metric ton at 1600 GMT, with the 
previous late kerb close in parentheses. Comex copper at 1641 GMT in cents a 
pound, with the previous close in parentheses.) Copper 1,554.50 (1,560.50) 
Tin 4,452.50 (4,502.50) 
Aluminum 1,452.25 (1,458.50) Zinc 871.50 (877.50) 
Nickel 5,925.00 (6,012.50) Lead 462.50 (465.00) 
Comex Sep Copper 70.75 (70.80)
An increase of 7,475 tons of copper Friday brought total stocks up to a 
12-month high of 550,300 tons. This pressured prices in early trade down to 
test $1,550/ton support before rising slightly to close at $1,554.50/ton, 
down from Thursday's close of $1,560.50/ton. 
Unconfirmed market talk said Enron is behind much of the week's stock rise, 
in an effort to ease nearby supply tightness and to alleviate the large short 
positions it is thought to have built up on the July-for-a-week spread, which 
is currently showing a $6-$8/ton backwardation. The July futures contract 
will switch over to cash Monday. 
Enron declined to comment on the market talk.

"Copper has been sensitive to moves in the stock market, but not this time," 
Norrish said. In fact, now it appears that base metals markets ignore 
equities markets when they rally, but follow stocks down when they slump, he 
added. 
Aluminum also ended the late kerb lower Friday. 
News of the restart of some smelters has dampened sentiment, despite a stock 
drawdown of around 8,000 tons since the end of last week, dealers said. 
"The stock drawdowns are fairly small percentage-wise," said Standard Bank 
analyst Robin Bhar, adding that they would need to be much larger to 
significantly improve market sentiment. 
"A test of $1,435/ton cannot be ruled out, though we would expect forward 
buying to prevent a break below this level for the time being," Barclays said 
in a market report. 
Zinc continued its slump, falling to a seven-and-a-half-year low, mainly on 
technicals. 
Technicals also hurt nickel, which rose slightly after breaking $5,900/ton 
support but still closed at its lowest level since April. 
Nickel's fall was "just on some speculative liquidation and short selling, 
mostly chart-based," Bhar said.

UK: Telecoms, drugs drive FTSE 100 rally, Vodafone leads.
By Camila Reed

07/13/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, July 13 (Reuters) - Britain's largest companies raced higher at the 
close on Friday fired by telecoms and drug stocks as they bounced back from 
Wednesday's 16-week low. 
Index heavyweights Vodafone and GlaxoSmithKline provided 27 of the day's 
55-point gain, while technology firms wobbled. However, the telecoms giant 
surged 4.1 percent to 157-1/4p.
The FTSE 100 finished 55.4 points or one percent firmer at 5,537.0, having 
jumped 1.66 percent on Thursday after seven consecutive losing sessions, with 
gainers outnumbering losers by three to one. 
Stocks steamed higher and refused to be derailed by sluggish U.S. retail 
sales figures for June, which showed only a meagre rise, and a weaker Wall 
Street, but volumes were thin at 1.4 billion shares. 
By London's 1530 GMT finish the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was 
down five points, while the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index was flat, 
having streaked up in the previous session. 
Mike Lenhoff and Simon Rubinsohn at money managers Gerrard said that the UK 
equity market was deeply oversold and long-term this presented a buying 
opportunity for UK equities. 
DRUGS SEE-SAW 
Drugs reversed an earlier decline with Nycomed Amersham among the day's top 
performers, up nearly four percent at 536-1/2p and AstraZeneca rising over 
one percent. 
Mining giant Anglo American moved into the FTSE 100 top ten gainers with a 
three percent rise, as investors sought refuge in mining stocks as a cyclical 
play. 
Another major gainer was British business services firm Hays Plc up 3.4 
percent. The shares leapt on market talk that Germany's Deutsche Post was 
looking to make a bid for it, dealers said. 
Both Deutsche Post and Hays declined to comment. 
Firmer crude prices gave support to the oil sector. BP rose 0.6 percent to 
572 pence and Shell also added 0.6 percent to 581-1/2p lifting the index by 
four points. 
FTSE MIXED PICTURE 
But dealers and analysts said it would be a mixed picture going forward with 
the market scrutinising data for signs of a sustained economic recovery or a 
lapse in consumer confidence. 
"This week we had a really bloody day on Wednesday and then the opposite on 
Thursday, so we're going to be on a rollercoaster still. It's very fragile 
but it does show the potential of the market," said Foreign & Colonial 
director of UK equities David Manning. 
"It's not only the holiday period, it's also that the market can make you 
look an idiot one day to the next. In that sort of circumstance the 
temptation is to do very little," he said. 
ABN Amro strategist Gareth Williams said the market would make modest 
progress over the next month or so, with moves downward quite likely although 
the trend would be upwards over the course of the year. 
TECHS DIP 
Thursday's 5.3-percent rally in the Nasdaq failed to bring any cheer to UK 
technology shares. Logica and Colt Telecom slid four percent, while microchip 
designer ARM fell 3.9 percent to 223 pence trimming Thursday's 13 percent 
jump. 
The techMARK index of technology shares rose 0.98 percent to 1,602.87. 
Elsewhere on the downside, UK holiday operator Airtours lost nearly 10 
percent of its value after Swiss peer Kuoni issued a profit warning. 
Among second liners, Baltimore Technologies closed up 3.3 percent. It 
initially rallied 22 percent after the Irish Internet security firm said it 
received an approach from an unlisted British-based company for an all-paper 
deal to combine the companies. 
The FTSE 250 Mid-cap index finished 5.1 points stronger at 6,163.8. 
Among small-caps, Paladin Resources' shares jumped 10 percent after the UK 
oil explorer said that major shareholder U.S. oil giant Enron had sold the 
whole of its 40-million-share stake via HSBC bank for 44 pence a share. 
Britain's Litho Supplies Plc slumped 42.5 percent after the company, which 
supplies printing and graphic arts products, said that sales in the first six 
months of 2001 were on target, but profits would likely be below expectations 
due to tough market conditions and pressure on margins.

Futures Contract Covering Coal Debuts in New York (Correct)
2001-07-13 08:48 (New York)

Futures Contract Covering Coal Debuts in New York (Correct)

     (Corrects location of FirstEnergy Corp. in 10th paragraph of
story that moved yesterday.)

     New York, July 12 (Bloomberg) -- The New York Mercantile
Exchange today began trading a futures contract for low-sulfur
coal, a fuel that President George W. Bush said will play a major
role in meeting electricity demand over the next two decades.
     The contract's debut came after prices for coal, considered
the dirtiest of power-plant fuels, doubled in the past year, as
demand from power plants outstripped mine production. Coal for
September delivery opened at $42 a ton and settled at $40.75, as
98 contracts were traded, exchange officials said.
     ``We had a big run-up in coal prices this past winter,'' said
Andy Ozley, who buys coal for Atlanta-based Mirant Corp.'s six
coal plants in New York, Illinois, Maryland and Virginia. ``This
contract affords us a way to mitigate our exposure'' to large
price swings.
     The Bush administration said in an energy policy report this
spring that coal would be the dominant fuel for electricity
generation through 2020. Bush gave an added boost to the fuel when
he retreated from a campaign pledge to restrict carbon dioxide
emissions, implicated in global warming.
     Coal plants are responsible for a third of the nation's
carbon dioxide emissions. They also produce sulfur dioxide, which
causes acid rain, and nitrogen oxides, which cause smog.
     The Nymex started the futures contract to give mining
companies and utilities a way to hedge their risks in the $33
billion coal market. Producers such as Peabody Energy Corp. and
Arch Coal Inc., whose shares have soared in the past year, have
said they would trade the futures.

                            New Plants

     Last year's quadrupling of prices for natural gas -- a
cleaner-burning power-plant fuel -- prompted many generators to
ramp up output from their coal plants. Utility coal stockpiles
dwindled, and prices have risen to their highest levels since at
least 1989.
     So far this year, more than a dozen companies have announced
plans to build coal-fired plants, including Kansas City, Missouri-
based Kansas City Power & Light Co. and Portland, Oregon-based
PacifiCorp.
     Although coal is used to produce 52 percent of the nation's
electricity, few plants were built during the 1990s because of the
high costs of building them and the difficulty of complying with
federal and local environmental regulations.
     Demand for coal has eased in recent weeks as below-normal
temperatures in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast reduced demand for
air conditioning, said Jim Parks, who buys coal for six power
plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania as director of fuels at Akron,
Ohio-based FirstEnergy Corp.
     ``The summer's been pretty mild so far -- you haven't seen
any big heat waves'' in regions with the most coal generation, he
said.

                           Big Sandy

     The Nymex futures contract calls for the delivery of 1,550
tons of low-sulfur coal to the mouth of the Big Sandy River near
Huntington, West Virginia. From there, the fuel would be loaded
onto Ohio River barges and shipped to power plants in the U.S. and
possibly Europe.
     The new contract is tailored to producers in Appalachian
states that account for about 40 percent of U.S. production,
including West Virginia, Kentucky and Pennsylvania, the No. 2, 3
and 4 coal producers.
     The industry lacks a futures contract for coal from Western
states that account for 47 percent of the nation's production,
including the No. 1 producer, Wyoming.

                         Avoiding the Past

     The exchange, which earns commissions on trades, hopes coal
futures will avoid the fate of other contracts it has started over
the past few years. Its six electricity futures contracts have
fizzled, as has its Middle East sour crude oil contract, which
debuted in May 2000.
     ``I said yesterday, if you traded 100 to 200 contracts, that
would be a really a good day,'' said Chris Casale, vice president
of energy trading at Dynegy Inc. in Houston, which trades coal and
buys the fuel for its six power plants in New York and Illinois.
``It came out sort of on target.''
     Most of today's trading was originated by large energy
marketing companies, he said, although he declined to say whether
Dynegy traded any contracts. Enron Corp., the largest energy
trader, and Duke Energy Corp., the largest U.S.-based utility
holding company, have said they would trade coal futures.
     Exchange officials have said the coal market has the
potential to reach 5,000 trades a day after a year of trading.
     The Nymex's 17-year-old crude oil futures contract averages
about 66,700 trades a day, and its 11-year-old natural gas
contract averages about 33,500.

                           Wary of Coal

     ``The coal market is still lacking liquidity,'' said Anthony
McAuley, a floor broker at ABN Amro Inc., who said he bought five
coal contracts for a client at $42 a ton -- the market's first
transaction. ``You probably need to see a little more
participation'' from industry coal buyers and sellers for the
market to take off.
     Independent floor traders, known as locals, are wary of
trading coal futures without assurances that the industry will be
active as well.
     ``Floor traders lost millions'' in electricity futures when
some were caught with high-priced contracts and nobody in the
industry to sell them to, he said.
     ``Because of that, people are a little bit tentative about
coal,'' said Tom Schiff, an independent crude oil trader. ``We're
here to help make liquidity but we can't tackle all the risk.''






		
		
		
		Modern Metals, July 2001

		
		
		Giant energy concern now turns its attention to steel. The company's 
aggressive posture has begged controversy. Industry reactions vary from 
hand-wringing to open arms. Still others characterize Enron as a "non-event."
		By Michelle
Martinez Arjona,
Editor-in-Chief,
and Paul Hohl,
Contributing Editor
		
		These days, saying the word "Enron" in a room full of metals executives is 
like screaming "fire" in a crowded theater. For most in the steel industry, 
the idea of a futures market is enough to raise a few eyebrows. But when a 
major market maker with annual revenues of 10 times the market cap of the 
U.S. steelmaking industry stakes a claim (for 2000 alone, Enron logged 
revenues of $101 billion--that's with a "b"), a lot more than eyebrows are 
likely to be raised. After a bold presentation from Jeff McMahon, president 
and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets, at the SSCI annual convention in May (in 
which he accused steel mills of treating their service center customers as 
"annoyances"), industry leaders rushed to understand this latest market 
contender. 
		Friend or foe? Competitor or partner? These are just a couple of the 
questions surrounding Enron's aggressive push into the metals industry. 
Judging from the service center and mill executives Modern Metals queried, 
there are as many answers as there are opinions in the industry. Reactions 
ranged from fear to acceptance to downright resentment. At least one mill was 
reticent to discuss Enron at all--still others seemed to meet the issue with 
unaffected shrugs. If the saying is true that all publicity is good 
publicity, the buzz that Enron has generated would make even a Hollywood spin 
doctor envious.
		What's the hubbub?
Although products such as natural gas and energy--Enron's major business 
platform--have been traded as commodities for years, until Enron's appearance 
a formal forward market for steel has never existed. According to McMahon, 
the absence of a liquid and transparent market has resulted in "uninformed 
investment decisions" that have exacerbated the current oversupply situation, 
and left companies exposed to the hazards of price volatility. 
		Enron's answer is to offer a variety of financial hedging products along with 
forward contracts in hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized (plate and long 
products are soon to follow), locking in prices for as many as five years 
out. Enron contends that it can act as a "risk intermediary" in steel 
transactions, ensuring healthier profit margins and lowering the cost of 
capital. Certain grades of steel are commodities, McMahon insists, and as 
such should be bought and sold on a commodity market basis, instead of the 
strategic relationships that now exist between the mills and consumers. Enron 
has been offering steel online, and via phone and fax, since November of last 
year.
		"Before you add capacity, before you make an investment decision, you'll be 
able to see a three, five, maybe even a 10-year forward price of steel," 
McMahon stated, "and if you want to hedge that investment you can do that."
		The company plans to buy steel at a floating price and then sell it to steel 
consumers at a fixed rate, making money on the spread. In February, Greg 
Hermans, VP of steel trading at Enron, reported to AMM that it was offering 
U.S.-made 10-gauge, 48-in. wide hot-rolled for April delivery in Chicago for 
$225 a ton. Hermans said Enron was buying the same product for April delivery 
at $215 a ton. 
		Eventually, Enron sees the development of four different marketplaces: the 
Northeast, the Midwest (or Chicago area), the Gulf Coast (or Houston area), 
and the West Coast. Enron will hedge against spot price spikes through equity 
and physical holdings in domestic mills. The company closed on Huntco's 
Arkansas-based cold-rolling mill in June.
		"It's a big portfolio," McMahon said. "We wanted to put together a portfolio 
of supply and demand. In some cases, we'll own assets--hopefully we'll own 
some term contracts with domestic mills. To the extent that imports are a 
part of the equation, we'll be a part of that market. We may purchase 
capacity from somebody, not necessarily the assets, but toll slab through a 
hot strip mill. All of those combined is how we do our business."
		Steel mills can benefit, McMahon said, by entering into a multi-year 
"physical off take" with Enron, thus giving steel mills a degree of certain 
volume and on product specification. Enron would guarantee purchase of a 
specified amount of tonnage, and use a floating price or a floor price to 
guard against market shocks. Whether mills would be willing to divert 
capacity to the commodity grades being bought and sold by Enron remains 
uncertain. At least one mill executive privately said no . . . at least for 
now.
		Nucor president, CEO and vice chairman, Dan DiMicco also sees little value in 
Enron's proposal. "What we need to have is stable pricing at levels where the 
most efficient mills can make a good return on their capital and further 
invest in new technologies and equipment," he stated. "I define true value as 
helping the industry to become stronger. It doesn't do any good to maintain a 
lack of price volatility at $200 a ton."
		Keith Busse, CEO at Steel Dynamics, echoed that sentiment in a recent New 
Steel article. "If you're trying to get volatility out at $320 [per ton], 
great," he said. "But at $230, you want to stick your fingers down your 
throat."
		For the service centers
Service centers, McMahon suggested, could benefit immediately. "The only way 
[distributors] are able to hedge themselves is to go out and buy inventory," 
he explained. "That takes capital, and cash, and space. We can offer a 
financial product that gives the exact same protection, but doesn't require 
any of the above.
		"We can hold those inventories and price the steel at the time of delivery to 
the service centers," he continued, "so their 4- or 5- percent net margins 
are somewhat certain."
		"I do think that Enron is providing a service for the industry . . . " 
commented Dave Lerman, CEO of Steel Warehouse, South Bend, Indiana. But he 
pointed out that "how [it] moves forward will be interesting. If they just 
move forward with hedge instruments . . . that's independent of whether you 
run your business well by having a good supplier that matches up with the 
demands of your customers. I think [Enron] will be a good thing for some 
people and a non-event for others."
		Beyond hedging, McMahon pointed out, firm and enforceable contracts could 
become a key benefit to service centers. As one Midwestern distributor source 
commented, "One of the terrible things that happens in our business is that 
end users demand long-term pricing, beyond what anybody can foresee. When 
they anticipate the market is going up, or that it has hit a low point, they 
push harder for it--as any one would. But historically, they don't honor the 
deals." 
		In a down market, he explained, customers demand lower prices. Noncompliance 
can result in orders, but no releases, and a "don't call us, we'll call you" 
attitude from customers. The consequence for service centers, he said, are 
price reductions on the way down and on the way up. "If Enron brings 
integrity to both sides of this market," he concluded, "that would be a very 
big plus for the steel industry."
		But integrity, another Midwest service center exec countered, has got nothing 
to do with it. In his estimation, Enron is like a profiteering carpetbagger, 
"trying to make a buck in between the producer and the user. That's all we 
need right now," he declared, "somebody trying to squeeze out a few more 
dollars." But, he recognized, "we're all going to have to deal with it."
		Don McNeeley, president and CEO of Chicago Tube & Iron, indicated that some 
good could come of a heavy-hitter like Enron introducing new ideas into the 
industry, but acknowledged that people might be offended by somebody picking 
the so-called "low-hanging fruit" of the steel market in the current economy. 
"What do you think the mills are going to do when you come to them for just 
the peripheral items?" he queried. "My concern would be that the price would 
go up on [those items]."
		McNeeley also questioned the wisdom of distributors relinquishing control of 
their inventories. "In distribution, 60 percent of our net worth is 
inventory, 30 percent is accounts receivable, and 10 percent is plant 
property and equipment," he related. "Our single largest asset is our 
inventory. If a distribution company surrenders control of its inventory to a 
third party, does not that distributor, in effect, surrender its own 
sovereignty?"
		Only just begun
Questions abound regarding Enron's role as a physical supplier of steel as 
well. As one Minnesota-based service center exec put it, "are they ready to 
deal with problems?"
		Although Enron has expressed interest in being a physical supplier, Dave 
Lerman explained, "I think that's going to be a lot more difficult to 
implement." Enron would have to consider specific qualities, coil sizes, 
nuances of chemistry, surface quality, and formability. "Most customers 
require better than standard tolerances," he pointed out. "These are all 
issues that might complicate commodity sales."
		Delivery is another issue. As a physical supplier, Enron has virtually 
guaranteed just-in-time delivery, but as one service center source said, "the 
guarantee is good when the material shows up at my door. What happens if it 
doesn't show up? I disappoint a customer. What good does it do to sue [Enron] 
if I've lost a customer?"
		Mill executives have questioned whether Enron is a potential competitor. 
"They see Enron as someone likely to buy foreign steel in order to deliver it 
to a U.S. customer," said Chuck Bradford, principal of Bradford Research and 
a long-time industry observer. He cautioned against seeing Enron as too much 
of a physical supplier, speculating that the future of Enron, similar to the 
LME, will be in hedging. "You may see some [physical transactions] to start 
with," Bradford predicted, "just to get the ball rolling. But I don't see 
that as the way the market will develop."
		McMahon has been consistent in saying that Enron has little interest in 
becoming a steel manufacturer. The real value, he said, is in a transparent, 
liquid market. "We know the products work, we know the market wants them. Can 
any one particular mill or mills prevent that? We don't think so," he said. 
"It's not an 'if', it's a 'when'."
		The jury is still out on just how soon that "when" will come, and what those 
effects will be for the steel industry. And for all of the debate surrounding 
the issue, it seems a bit soon to be hitting the panic button. As Don 
McNeeley recounted, "I can recall similar controversy over a speech a guy 
gave about 15-17 years ago. That guy's name was Ken Iverson, and he had this 
concept called a mini-mill. Look at it now."

Subject: USG overtures on Dabhol

Rebecca
 At a meeting yesterday at OPIC on Trakya, another of our problem projects, 
Dabhol was raised.  A representative from the White House transition team 
joined the conversation.  I was asked the terms under which we were prepared 
to negotiate and I told them at a minimum upon a commitment by the Indian 
authorities to serious negotiations which would include full compliance with 
the terms of the contracts and progress in the reform of the MSEB.  I made 
clear that we do not see the Godbole Committee as the basis for such a 
discussion.
 I think the USG wants to be on record politically encouraging the Indian 
Govt. to engage in discussions all parties consider to be meaningful in hopes 
of working things out before it is too late, even while through OPIC and EXIM 
it is supporting the move towards PNT.  The administration may be concerned 
that without such a diplomatic overture on its part it could be concluded 
that the USG has politically taken a position on the project.
 In Trakya, for example, the USG has been quite proactive in pressing the 
Turkish govt on the payments issue and even in discussing the payment 
concerns with the IMF so that the payments issues for the BOTs (two of the 
four in Turkey are US sponsored) are taken into account as the IMF program 
moves forward.
 So I anticipate that the USG will shortly be meeting with the Indian 
ambassador here and the US Charge in Delhiwill likely be directed to make the 
rounds and meet with senior government officals on the project.
 I wanted you to be aware of this; also any guidance you can provide would be 
helpful.  Thanks John

Title: High Speed Regulation in California
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=3D35&m=3D2208


A Feverish Pitch
The pace of regulatory and political events in California has taken on the
feverish pitch of the energy market crisis itself. Important decisions
regarding a wide range of market structure issues are being made quickly at=
=20
the
California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and the state Legislature,
increasing the level of uncertainty most market participants already percei=
ve
in the quickly evolving California market. Sudden changes are being made to=
=20
the
market structure, changes that used to require years in California=01,s com=
plex
regulatory and legislative proceedings.

As rolling blackouts have rippled through urban centers of Northern Califor=
nia
on January 17 and 18, including in portions of downtown San Francisco,
Sacramento, and the Silicon Valley, state officials are scrambling to set u=
p
the appropriate credit mechanisms to ensure the continued delivery of scarc=
e
western energy supplies to California=01,s two largest utilities. Even at p=
rices
near $800 per megawatt-hour (MWh), the California Department of Water=20
Resources
(CDWR), attempting to buy power on behalf of Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E=
)
and Southern California Edison (SCE), has been unable to secure enough to k=
eep
the lights on. In the mean time, legal actions by some energy suppliers
threaten to tip the utilities into bankruptcy=01*and are being held at bay =
only=20
by
direct intervention of California=01,s governor.

Below is a summary of the various state actions being pursued concurrently:

*California governor. California Governor Gray Davis continues to attempt t=
o
act on behalf of PG&E and SCE to secure long-term contracts for supply from
merchant generation owners and marketers in California. On the same front, =
the
governor has been negotiating with generators in an attempt to keep them fr=
om
seeking compensation through the courts for energy delivered to the utiliti=
es.
Court-ordered reimbursement could prompt bankruptcy.

*Legislature. Bills have been approved to authorize continued power purchas=
es
on behalf of PG&E and SCE by the CDWR, to restructure the independent syste=
m
operator=01,s (ISO) governing board to consist of five members appointed by=
 the
governor, to restrict the ability of the ISO to enter into a broader=20
interstate
regional transmission organization (RTO) without the explicit approval of
California=01,s Electricity Oversight Board, and to prohibit the divestitur=
e of
the investor-owned utilities=01, remaining generating assets until 2006. Th=
e
vehicle for pursuing authorization of state bond financing for acquisition =
of
transmission assets and construction of new generation facilities is still
being developed.

*California Public Utilities Commission. On January 18 the CPUC adopted a
decision prohibiting the sale of SCE=01,s Mohave Generating Station to AES.=
 This
voids a sale that was announced but not closed. The CPUC also delayed=20
decisions
regarding SCE=01,s application to end its rate freeze and the prudency crit=
eria
for utilities entering into long-term supply contracts.

Some of these issues will continue to evolve as they progress along their
respective and sometimes intersecting paths, and some will need to pass=20
through
multiple review bodies. This rapid and erratic evolution has not helped to
decrease either the financial risk associated with supplying energy to
California=01,s two largest utilities, or the level of uncertainty in devel=
oping
new generation to supply California in the future.

The ISO anticipates that it will call stage 3 emergencies (reserves less th=
an
1.5 percent) for January 19 and will most likely continue to curtail
interruptible customers through the weekend. Western energy supplies are be=
ing
strained by recent heavy usage of hydroelectric facilities where water=20
supplies
are already as much as 25 percent below average, owing to low precipitation=
=20
and
continued plant outages near 9,000 MW in California. The gravity of the
financial condition of California=01,s two largest utilities is exemplified=
 by=20
the
need for other, more creditworthy intermediaries, including California
municipal utilities, state agencies, and some unregulated energy suppliers,=
 to
act as temporary  guarantors for the acquisition of energy on behalf of PG&=
E
and SCE.

Don Morton, general counsel of Wabash Valley Power Association, a co-op in 
AEP's area, called me about Enron's protest of AEP's market based rates 
filing.  Wabash has filed an appeal in the DC Circuit of AEP/CSW merger (its 
brief is due 11/20).  He thinks FERC is out of control and not carrying on 
its duties.  Wabash is also preparing a protest of the Alliance compliance 
filing (due this Friday 10/6) on the following grounds:

Filing is really a continuation of pancaking
Does not want FERC to approve on a "conditional" basis (expecting Alliance to 
be a true RTO)--Wabash thinks that Alliance simply creates a larger profit 
center for AEP's transmission system

Mr. Morton also had some specific OASIS problem examples that happened to 
Wabash that involved preferential treatment for AEP.  I told him to call or 
email Scott Miller for the investigation.

Mr. Morton and Wabash CEO, Ed Martin, would like to come to Houston to visit 
with Enron about our concerns and about the possibility of making some joint 
filings.  His number is 317-481-2815.  Please let me know if I should set 
something up or if someone else would like to talk with him directly.

Study Finds That Many Large Companies Pay No Taxes 
By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 
? 
10/20/2000 
The New York Times 
Page 2, Column 1 
c. 2000 New York Times Company 
Goodyear, Texaco, Colgate-Palmolive, MCI WorldCom and eight other large 
corporations earned more than $12.2 billion in profits in 1996 through 1998, 
but none of them ended up owing corporate income taxes over that period, 
according to a study released yesterday. Indeed, as a group, the companies 
received $535 million in credits or refunds, the report found. 
The study of 250 large publicly traded companies showed that 24 owed no tax 
or received credits against past or future tax obligations in 1998, up from 
13 in 1997 and 16 in 1996. The study also found that 71 of the 250 companies 
paid taxes at less than half the official 35 percent corporate rate during 
the three-year period. 
The study was conducted by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a 
Washington research organization associated with Citizens for Tax Justice, a 
nonprofit group supported in part by labor unions. The group argues that the 
tax system favors the rich and politically connected. 
Corporate profits overall soared 23.5 percent during the three-year period, 
but corporate tax revenues grew just 7.7 percent, a disjunction that has 
drawn intense interest from the Treasury Department and some members of 
Congress who are concerned about the growing market for tax shelters and 
their abuse. 
In recent years, Congress has watered down the 1986 overhaul of the tax laws, 
which lowered rates and eliminated most tax shelters, and was supposed to 
simplify reporting. The recent changes have opened fresh opportunities for 
corporations to cut their taxes, the study found. 
''Corporate taxes are not rising along with profits because companies have 
found all sorts of ways to get around the reforms in the 1986 tax act,'' said 
Robert S. McIntyre, the director of Citizens for Tax Justice. ''Companies 
also have gotten a lot of help from Congress, especially in gutting the 
minimum tax rules.'' 
Mr. McIntyre said that he and T. D. Coo Nguyen, the co-author, spent more 
than two years examining financial statements the companies sent to 
shareholders. 
All but 18 of the companies studied are on the Fortune 500 list, and the 
others are in the Fortune 1000. He said companies were excluded if they lost 
money or their tax disclosures ''were crafted so that you could not figure 
them out.'' 
At least two companies objected to the study's methodology. 
Keith Price, a spokesman for Goodyear, said the study did not appear to 
consider an accounting rule affecting its sale of a pipeline subsidiary in 
1998. It made no objection to the 1996 and 1997 figures. 
Michael N. Ambler, Texaco's chief tax counsel, said that his company had tax 
disputes with the Internal Revenue Service that were unresolved after more 
than a decade. If those disputes are settled with a refund, he said, that can 
easily distort the figures for any one year. He said that even the three-year 
study period was too short to give an accurate picture. 
Timothy McCormally of the Tax Executives Institute, which represents 
officials at large companies, told Bloomberg News that the companies named in 
the report did nothing wrong. ''There is nothing in the report that suggests 
that any of this results from any illegal or improper activity,'' he said. 
The study by the Washington institute showed that the corporate tax burden 
was falling in many cases because of the growing use of stock options, which 
are an expense for tax purposes but do not count against profits reported to 
shareholders. 
Recent annual reports filed by Microsoft and Cisco Systems indicate that they 
paid no federal income taxes in 1999 because stock options exercised by 
employees wiped out profits for tax purposes. 
The study found that General Electric, I.B.M., Pfizer, Intel and 
Bristol-Myers Squibb also sharply reduced their tax rates because of stock 
options without having to show reduced earnings to shareholders. 
The most significant factor in the easing corporate tax burden, Mr. McIntyre 
said, can be traced to actions in Congress, which relaxed the corporate 
minimum tax in 1993 when the Democrats were in control of both the House and 
Senate, and again in 1997, after the Republicans had taken over. Congress 
made it easier for corporations to spread tax breaks and profits over many 
years, including reaching back to past years to get tax breaks that could not 
be used at the time. 
In at least one of the three years studied, 41 of the 250 large companies 
studied paid no federal income tax. Those 41 companies reported $25.8 billion 
in profits to shareholders in the years they paid no taxes. If they had been 
obligated to pay the full 35 percent corporate rate, the tax bill would have 
been $9 billion, but the companies received $3.2 billion in refunds. 
In total dollars, General Electric was the biggest beneficiary of tax breaks, 
the study said, saving $6.9 billion in three years. The company paid $2.1 
billion in income taxes on $25.8 billion in profits, for a tax rate of 8.1 
percent. 
The highest tax rate for the three years was paid by Winn-Dixie Stores, which 
paid an average of 35.7 percent of its 1996 through 1998 profits in federal 
income taxes. It was one of two companies that paid more than the 35 percent 
statutory rate because of multiyear tax rules. The other was Paccar. 

Chart: ''Profits Without Pain'' In a study of 250 large and profitable 
companies, these 17 paid the least in corporate taxes -- or got the biggest 
refunds -- as a percentage of profits from 1996 to 1998. Goodyear 1996-98

Legal Breaks Lower Some Corporate Tax Rates 
? 
10/20/2000 
Los Angeles Times 
Home Edition

Copyright 2000 / The Times Mirror Company 
WASHINGTON -- Dozens of America's most profitable companies enjoyed tax-free 
years during the 1990s largely because of legal tax breaks, an independent 
study released Thursday found. 
The report by the nonprofit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found 
that 250 companies paid an effective tax rate of 20.1% in 1998, down from 
22.9% just two years before. The federal income tax rate for corporations is 
supposed to be 35%. 
Of the 250 companies studied, 41 enjoyed at least one year of no income taxes 
or an actual rebate from the federal government, despite pretax profits of 
$25.8 billion from 1996 to 1998. 
If all 250 companies had paid the full 35% on $735 billion in pretax profits, 
the study estimated the total income tax would have come to $257 billion. But 
tax breaks put into law by Congress lowered those companies' tax bills by $98 
billion over the three-year period. 
Companies getting tax rebates in 1998 alone included Texaco Inc., Chevron 
Corp., PepsiCo Inc., J.P. Morgan & Co., Enron Corp. and General Motors Corp., 
the report found. 
The study's chief author, Robert S. McIntyre, said companies lower their 
taxes through such breaks as depreciation write-offs, tax credits for 
research and development and deductions they take when employees exercise 
stock options. 
The report also found that the petroleum industry paid the lowest tax rate 
from 1996 to 1998, at 12.3%, followed by electronics at 13.1%, forest and 
paper products at 13.9% and transportation at 14%. At the other end of the 
spectrum, publishing and printing companies paid 31.6%, gas and electric 
utilities paid 28.1% and retail and wholesale trade companies paid 27.6%.

Arena boosters tout 3 benefits 
Some question property/sales tax numbers, new development 
By ERIC BERGER 
Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Enron Field sparked the redevelopment of downtown's east side, boosters say, 
and an arena would crown the revitalization of the long-neglected area. 
A strongly pro-arena business organization, Central Houston Inc., released a 
flurry of positive economic numbers to back its contention that Enron Field 
is a boon to downtown as well as to city, county and school tax coffers, and 
that the arena would be as well. 
"There's no better way to measure the impact of sports facilities on downtown 
than to look at the one we already have," said the organization's president, 
Bob Eury, as he crooked a finger toward the ballpark. 
Eury and other boosters outlined three economic benefits to Houston they say 
are related to sports facilities: increased property tax revenues, a wealth 
of new development in the area and a boost in sales tax collected. 
But economic analysts questioned some of their conclusions. 
When Enron Field was built, nine blocks were taken off the tax rolls at a 
cost of about $284,000 in lost property taxes. 
Eury said, though, that it was not a bad trade. 
He noted that properties around the ballpark have leaped in value since the 
Enron Field project began in the mid-1990s. In turn, the annual property tax 
collected on land and buildings within four blocks of the ballpark is $2.4 
million greater now than in 1995. 
But Harris County Tax Assessor-Collector Paul Bettencourt said those figures 
are due in part to the boom in land values across downtown, including the 
central business district, since 1995. 
Bettencourt said he hoped to have an analysis finished today to determine 
whether land values around Enron Field had increased at a greater rate than 
land in the rest of downtown. 
The boosters also highlighted more than $700 million worth of private 
developments planned -- but not yet completed -- near the ballpark, including 
the $90 million, 37-story Ballpark Place Tower across Crawford Street from 
Enron Field. 
"Without a doubt, if Enron Field was not there, Ballpark Place would not be 
there," said John Holland, an executive vice president for the Trammel Crow 
Co., which expects to break ground on the project in early 2001. 
Because the arena would be built in an urban core, even academics who are 
skeptical about the economic benefits of sports stadiums agreed that spin-off 
development is likely nearby. 
But independent economists who have studied such issues, including Brad 
Humphreys, an assistant professor at the University of Maryland-Baltimore 
County, say development near a stadium usually has a negative impact on 
development and businesses in other parts of a city. 
The focus must be on the entire market, Humphreys said, not just in the 
vicinity of a sports facility. 
"Public subsidization of stadiums and arenas isn't necessarily a bad thing," 
he said. "But when they sell them as economic engines, it's just absolutely 
wrong. The research doesn't show that." 
A recent study Humphreys co-authored, which appeared in the fall 1999 issue 
of the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, found that the presence of 
professional sports teams in a market, on average, actually reduced the 
per-capita income in those markets, compared with similar markets without 
such teams. 
Given Houston's strong economy, Eury said he does not believe downtown 
development will detract from other areas of the city, as Humphreys' studies 
have shown in other markets. 
A third major economic benefit offered Thursday was that a new arena, with 
the Houston Rockets and Houston Comets as tenants, would generate $13 million 
a year in sales tax revenues. 
About $2.7 million of that would go into local coffers, with the remainder 
going to the state, according to the study performed for Eury's group by CSL 
International, a consulting firm. 
Yet even in the absence of a new arena and both teams, many economists say a 
large portion of those expenditures would be spent in the area anyway. That 
is known as a "substitution effect." 
Instead of a family going to a game, it might go to the movies or local zoo. 
And corporations are likely to sponsor other local events out of their 
advertising budgets, the economists say. 
The CSL study did not account for this substitution effect in calculating the 
sales tax impact, said Bill Rhoda, the firm's director. 


	



Study: Dozens of corporations pay little or no income tax

WASHINGTON (AP) - Dozens of America's most profitable companies enjoyed 
tax-free years during the 1990s largely because of legal tax breaks, an 
independent study released Thursday found. 
The report by the nonprofit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found 
that 250 companies paid an effective tax rate of 20.1 percent in 1998, down

research and development and deductions they take when employees exercise 
stock options. 
"We hope our findings will encourage lawmakers to re-examine this important 
area of taxation," McIntyre said. 
The report also found that the petroleum industry paid the lowest tax rate 
from 1996-98, at 12.3 percent, followed by electronics at 13.1 percent, 
forest and paper products at 13.9 percent and transportation at 14 percent. 
At the other end of the spectrum, publishing and printing companies paid 31.6 
percent, gas and electric utilities paid 28.1 percent and retail and 
wholesale trade companies paid 27.6 percent. 
"Anyone who worries about our economy's long-term growth has to wonder why 
the tax code is being used to favor some industries and some kinds of 
investments over others, rather than letting market forces decide," McIntyre 
said.

US Rep Drafts Bill To Impose Windfall Tax On Pwr Companies.
By JASON LEOPOLD

10/19/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California's summer of soaring wholesale 
electricity prices helped boost the stock price of many energy companies in 
the third quarter.
But if U.S. Rep. Bob Filner, D-Calif., gets his way, those companies will be 
forced to pay back hundreds of millions of dollars in profit to utilities, 
customers and the government. 
Filner introduced a bill in the House of Representatives last week that would 
impose a windfall profit tax on wholesale power sold throughout the western 
U.S. 
The bill, which was referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means, may be 
discussed in December or January, according to Filner, and if he gets enough 
support by the mostly Republican caucus, companies like Enron Corp. (ENE), 
Duke Energy North America (DUK), Southern Co. (SO). Reliant Energy (REI) and 
Dynegy (DYN), would only be allowed to show a certain amount of profit and 
anything over that amount would be taxed 100%. 
Filner said the amount of profit hasn't been determined but his bill calls 
for a baseline that would be a "just and reasonable" amount of profit. 
The congressman's San Diego constituents were paying market-based electricity 
rates in the summer which resulted in triple-digit utility bills. He said 
generators are gouging California customers and need to be held responsible. 
"This is not just a problem of supply and demand," Filner told Dow Jones 
Newswires. "This is stealing. And we want our money back." 
State and federal regulators are conducting separate investigations into 
California's wholesale power crisis. The findings, expected to be complete in 
about two weeks, are aimed at determining if generators or other key players 
manipulated the state's wholesale energy market. 
At least two major energy companies are being investigated by California 
Attorney General Bill Lockyer. A high level source working on the probe with 
the Attorney General said third-quarter earnings statements will play a major 
role in finding out if generators manipulated the market. 
Their investigation isn't turning up much evidence but earnings statements 
are showing that profits are up significantly largely due to wholesale prices 
in California, the source said. 
At least one Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioner, who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity, said the wholesale electricity market in California 
will be in for a "rude awakening" when the agency completes its 
investigation. 
"There will be some serious structural changes to the market," the 
commissioner said. 
Representatives from energy companies told Dow Jones Newswires that higher 
profits weren't the result of illegal activity or manipulating the market. 
Energy Cos. Say Summer Crisis Boosted 3Q Earnings 
On Wednesday, Duke Energy, which owns and operates power plants in 
California, said in an earnings statement that third-quarter profit rose 74%, 
due in part, to high wholesale prices in California in the summer. Enron and 
several other companies reported similar third-quarter increases based on 
California's summer of skyrocketing power prices. 
The congressman doesn't want to limit the proposed windfall tax to 
California, but where generators sell power in the western U.S. 
But even Filner admits that forcing generators to refund part of their 
profits isn't getting the early support it needs to become law. 
"If the democrats were in charge I'd have this bill voted on already," Filner 
said. 
Filner said if the bill is passed some of the money would be refunded to 
consumers and utilities, the victims, as he refers to them. 
Meanwhile, he's also working on getting the House to pass a separate bill to 
roll back electricity rates in the western U.S. to pre-deregulation levels 
and he's trying to gather support for a wind power initiative. 
Regardless of the outcome, the congressman is dead set on making noise. 
"If nothing happens, I'm thinking about holding a press conference with the 
San Diego District Attorney," he said. "We'll press criminal charges against 
the energy companies." -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;

Lauren,

Mr. Shapiro has updated his presentation.  Can you make sure that this 
version is available to him for Monday's meeting?  Also, will his 
presentation be saved on a computer for his use or does he need to have it on 
a "CD/diskette"?  

Thanks

I left Hannon a message that we PAID for the attention we got from 
Wimbledon.  It came out of the advertising budget.  We did Kevin a favor by 
trying to leverage our media budget to create new business for EBS.  Am I 
looking at this the right way?

I appreciated Margaret's update here but I was looking for a bit more.  
Specifically I think we should determine a fair market value for the PR we 
received from the event overall and I would like to transfer pay that amount 
from Corp to EBS.  I know that sounds a little agressive but if you think 
about it the analysts are very focused on EBS's streaming revenue, which has 
been tough to come by.  Also it really is a net zero dollar amount to Enron 
at the end of the day but hopefully value creating to the stock price.  Hope 
this is not a problem.

Hello Kevin,

David Tagliarino mentioned that you were interested in capturing the overall 
exposure we received through the Wimbledon deal. I have summarized the main 
visibility we received.  There were several more "freebies" in the end, but 
they are not accounted for in the following:

We had a total of 40 thirty-second commercials that ran on NBC and TNT (the 
Turner Network). We also had 8-10 billboards which said "This portion of 
Wimbledon was brought to you by Enron, a leading energy and broadband 
services company." The broadcaster who announced the match also gave us plugs 
by saying, "Watch this on the net at www.wimbledon.net, streamed by Enron." 
There was a banner floating across the bottom of the page saying that as well.

Additionally we received ad time and billboards on ESPN, CNNsi and several 
other networks.  We had banners streaming on up to 10 websites, including 
www.msnbc.com, www.cnnsi.com and www.wimbledon.net.  There was also a static 
banner on the Wimbledon Channel, no matter which site you watched it on 
(Wimbledon, CNNsi or MSNBC).  All the banners took you to a jump page we 
created, located at www.enron.net/wimbledon. 

At Wimbledon we had 12 courtside seats and 24 grounds passes.  I was also 
told that we had a small paid contract with FastTV.com to stream the archived 
site. We released a press release on our services with IBM, IMG, TWII and 
Wimbledon several days into the event; and EBS sent out an email to top 
clients/potential clients directing them to the site.  Business Week is also 
releasing a profile on Enron in their upcoming eBiz section, which features 
the Wimbledon Club as a customer. 


Please let me know if you have any questions I can answer.  

Have a great day, Margaret

I think the meeting is on Wednesday, but if you can be there (Sacremento, I 
expect) you should.  As I mentioned in my voicemail, I think the meeting will 
not be particularly substantive;  more likely it is a photo op for the 
governor to show how tough he is on the pirate generators.  Based on your 
message below, should we still plan to send somebody?  I still think we 
should if we can manage the legal risk.

Mike:  would you be able to attend as well?

Williams, Reliant, Enron, Duke, AES, Dynegy, Mirant and Sempra have been
invited to a meeting with the Governor.  The press release provides: "The
agenda will include "unpaid debts, credit and the supply of power."
Williams is concerned about attending such a meeting of competitors without
the presence of antitrust counsel even under the sponsorship of the Governor
(who presumably acts as both the sovereign and on behalf of the buyer(s)).
We are looking into the Sovereign immunity and Noerr-Pennington issues to
determine how best to protect any such group discussions from challenge or
as evidence in any of the pending cases.  Are any of your clients also
concerned about this and are you also looking into these issues?
Williams would like to have a joint defense protected conference call
(perhaps later today if possible) to discuss this meeting and consider
whether antitrust counsel is needed for the group or if each participant
should attend with its own counsel.  Please let me have your thoughts and
whether one of you (or other counsel) is interested and available to
participate in a conference call.  Thanks/

Is there an alternative quote we could use instead of the reference to 
"stabilizing" in the California market?  I think I know what we mean but most 
outside readers would see the situation as unstable.  Perhaps we could 
reference the continued availability of direct access or renewed interest in 
Enron's offerings?

Dear Ken: ?Congratulations on the Bush ?presidency. ?There's a lot of us out 
here from both parties who think that after Bush has finished his terms that 
you would be an ideal President yourself. ?I know you are very busy so I just 
wanted to bring to your attention two individuals I would highly recommend to 
serve at the Department of Energy. ?First Daryl Owen would be a great 
candidate for Deputy. ?He was the former staff Director of the Senate Energy 
Committee under Bennett Johnston and is very familiar with energy issues but 
also with all the weapons issues. ?I can speak at lenght about his abilities 
having known him for over 20 years. ?He also has a great respect on the Hill. 
?Secondly, ?I know you know Don Santa who would like to return to Government 
Service. ?I'm not sure what the new administration will do for the 
Chairma! ns! hip of FERC with Curt Hebert, but Don who is a Republican would 
be a 
great choice also. ?He has very good support on the Hill, has served at a 
post at LG&E ?and is also a very good policy fellow. ?Thanks for any 
consideration you might give. ?I can be reached by any of your folks at ?The 
Williard office building 202-737-2338 or at home at 703 779-0661. ?This 
retirement stuff is interesting . ?The energy business is even more so. ?
Always the best. ?Have a great new Year. ?Rick Richard

It's a little hard to tell precise numbers from the charts so I need a "call 
out" number from the charts ... specifically,what happened to microsoft's 
turnover rate for how much stock decline -- eg did it go up 33% (from 9% to 
12%) for "x" decline in the stock price?

I think you sent this back to me by mistake and were intending it to go to 
you assistant.

I am scheduled to see you on the 5th.  I was just looking to get a little 
advice.  Rebecca has asked me to join her in EGA and I am fine with doing 
that.  I just wanted to pick your brain on longer term career things I should 
be thinking about.

Look forward to talking with you.

Time Urgent


Enron Energy Services Operations, Inc. (EESO) is being asked to sign an 
affidavit in connection with a bid to the City of Chicago (the bid is in the 
name of Enron Building Services, Inc.).  Among the items in the affidavit is 
a statement disclosing whether EESO or Enron Building Services (and 
presumably any other Enron entity) has had a business relationship with a 
Chicago city elected official in the previous 12 months.  "Business 
relationship" is defined broadly to include business dealings with the 
official, his or her spouse or entities in which the official has a financial 
interest which entitles the official to payment of $2,500 or more in any 
calendar year.  There are also certain exceptions that apply.

We are required to sign and submit the Affidavit this week, so if you are 
aware of any transactions that might require disclosure in the above 
Affidavit, please contact me by the end of the day today.  I apologize for 
the urgent nature of this request.

Thank you,
David Roland

I have attached some suggestions in the comment section on the 
presentation.   I think we also need to have a set of slides or some talking 
points for Jeff that make a compelling case for these changes.  Some of the 
points are touched on but I think we have to make a better case for change in 
addition to outlining the changes.  Some of the themes which we should 
develop further might focus on the challenges we face in sustaining our 
growth (this was a major theme at this year's management conference -- 
Terrie, please forrward a copy of Gary Hamel's presentation to the addressees 
on this e-mail).  These challenges imply the solutions we are proposing: a 
professional partnership model which provides opportunity and compensation 
incentives to attract and retain top talent and encourage cooperation across 
the company; capturing and exploiting knowledge within the organization; and 
a more formalized approach to business building through an accelerator.

I will be in California on Monday, but let's try to set up one more meeting 
before we get together with Jeff.  I can make time on Tuesday or Wednesday.

Ken talked to Sen Kinder.  He made the points you had prepared.  Kinder 
agreed to shelve the legislation for this session.  He said he had been 
hearing from several others, including Proctor and Gamble (which has a big 
facility in his district) that the legislation was not going to help 
competition develop in the state.  He expressed willingness to work with us 
on a better package and also expressed interest in coming to Enron's 
offices.  He is going to be in San Antonio in August and would like to come 
to Houston around that time.

I enjoyed talking with you the other day and am happy to answer your 
questions:  both the Texas position and the Washington DC position report to 
Rick Shapiro.  From a government affairs standpoint, I've divided the world 
between Rick's group (the Americas) and Mark Schroeder's group (Europe and 
Asia).  Both Rick and Mark report to me.

Joe Allen continues as part of the Texas legislative team, working for the 
head of that group (formerly Kathleen Magruder).

Terry Thorn has taken a commercial position in Enron and no longer works on 
government affairs issues for the company (except to the extent we call on 
various executives to help from time-to-time).

Subject: Thanks & Questions

STEVE: I very much appreciate your call the day before yesterday and your
asking if I would like to compete to succeed Joe Hillings as head of Enron's
Washington office. Although until that moment I hadn't thought of returning
to Washington except to serve again in national office, I would be pleased
to talk further about this opportunity with you or your recruiter.

In recalling our conversation, I realize that twice you asked if I had any
questions, and if I had been quick to take advantage of your offer, I would
have asked how government relations are handled at Enron. To whom does Joe
Hillings report: to you or to Terry Thorne? You mentioned a woman who
currently has responsibility for government relations in Texas and some
neighboring states but is leaving for another job at Enron; to whom does she
report? Then there is Joe Allen, whom I have known since our days in the
Legislature; doesn't he (also) handle Texas affairs?

I am sorry I didn't ask you all this on Tuesday. Whatever the answers, it's
clear that government relations are  much more central to the work of Enron
than at Compaq, which is why it would be a very exciting place to work.
Thanks again for your call, your courtesy, and your indulgence with this
tardy line of questioning. With best wishes, CHASE.

honoring nationally known men who have supported women on women's issues.  
This year they would like to honor Ken Lay, if he is interested.  Sue does 
need to know if he supports the equal rights amendment and particularly the 
pro-choice amendment as her organization is a pro-choice organization.

Sue can be reached at 908-707-0022 if you would like to speak with her.

Please advise on the above.

Mark,

Thanks for your note.  It's a common misconception that we will be mostly 
working on asset disposition.  Our focus will be on the efficient operation 
of the assets, cleaning up problems, finishing projects etc.  The sales 
efforts will be conducted through Cliff Baxter's group with support from us.  
So, I don't believe that  I will need the type of effort that you believe 
David can provide and I have no other need for him at this juncture.  Cliff 
may feel that he has the need for David.  By the way, my experience with 
David when he worked for APAChi was that he had not learned much about the 
business and therefore was not terribly helpful to us as we were 
restructuring the group or when we were in a build mode in Thailand.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Regards,
Rebecca

With your new organisation, I expect that you will have issues that will 
require support from my team, covering everything outside the Americas (Rick 
Shapiro providing support in the Americas).  Any thoughts either of you have 
regarding what your requirements might be would be helpful.  My understanding 
is that a fair bit of your effort will be focussed on asset disposition.  If 
that is correct, I want to run one idea by you.  We still have David Merrill 
posted as an expat in Singapore.  He is not working out as support for EBS 
(totally new field to him).  What are your thoughts on David returning to the 
energy arena, and focussing on flying around, as appropriate, to meet with 
various governments, working to secure necessary approvals, as/when/if 
needed?  Seems to fit his skill sets, based on prior government experience 
that he has.  

A second person who could also fill this role, though he is looking at other 
opportunities within Enron and may not be available, is Mike Dahlke.  
Thoughts on this person for this role?

Jeff Skilling proposed a solution to Gov Davis to solve the supply and 
pricing problems in the California market.  In summary, the proposal would 
have a neutral party conduct an auction wherein the utilities would seek bids 
for 5-10 year packages of power from suppliers.  The gov asked if anyone had 
successfully conducted such an auction in the industry already.

I need your help to identify and describe any such examples (European or 
North American) by mid day Monday. Jeff and I will have a follow up call with 
the governor on Monday.

I am attaching the FERC order and staff recommendations.  The order provides 
for $69 million in "potential" refunds (either pay up or provide cost 
justification).  Enron was not named as one of the 13 overcharging parties, 
but PGE was ($3.18 million).  It's not over yet, though.  The order deals 
only with Jan 01 and promises further orders regarding Dec 00 and benchmark 
prices through April 01.  The prices used to determine refunds were fairly 
high ($273/mwh based on gas prices, emissions costs and an assumed heat rate 
of over 16000).

With respect to sales to California, we have concluded at least one short 
term sale and have talked with Cal Dept of Water Resources about longer term 
deals, but we were still struggling with credit issues, last I heard.  I'm 
copying Jeff Dasovich because I'm sure he has more up to date information.

In the press, I saw two news stories that I wondered if we (Enron) had any 
role/hand in, and what was the offical "spin" in both cases.  1)  The FERC 
Order requiring something like 55-65 million dollars in refunds by generators 
(or did it include traders) for overcharging in California in December, if I 
recall my facts/news stories correctly, and 2) the reports of 40 companies 
entering into 10-year contracts with California (touted by Davis).  Was Enron 
a contracting party?  Do we think this is a good solution (I think I know the 
answer, but defer to your lead on this, so we stay on your message)?  thanks

Eric Shaw's team has learned that an investigation has been initiated by th=
e=20
Turkish military to expose and eliminate corruption in the Turkish energy=

On January 6, the military took seven energy sector bureaucrats into custod=

In the following days, other officials from TEA? (the electricity generatio=
n=20

While many of the bureaucrats and executives have been released, a leaked=
=20
report from the military investigators suggests that the operation is wide=
=20
ranging and may ultimately target the Minister of Energy and Natural=20

Enron Implications

Trakya - One Turkish newspaper has reported that Enron=01,s  478 MW Trakya =
power=20
project was being investigated.  This has not been reported anywhere else. =
=20
Because the power price at Trakya has been the target of criticism in the=

past, we are not surprised by this report. Although an investigation is=20
always a possibility, other than the one newspaper report, there has been n=

GAMA - It has also been reported that the wife of Gorkhan Yardim, the Gener=

that his wife has been working at GAMA since 1993, long before Yardim had=

F.Y.I.

                              
  California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Power Costs 
  By Rebecca Smith 
    
  09/01/2000 
  The Wall Street Journal 
  Page A4 
  (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

  California lawmakers voted to extend modest relief to San Diego residents 
burdened with
  high electricity bills and set the groundwork for faster construction of 
badly needed power
  plants. They stopped short, however, of passing legislation that would roll 
back retail power
  rates to levels seen prior to deregulation .

  Late Wednesday, lawmakers sent a bill to Gov. Gray Davis that limits to 6.5 
cents per
  kilowatt hour the amount that small customers of San Diego Gas & Electric 
Co. can be
  charged. The utility is allowed to add power-delivery and other reasonable 
costs to that
  commodity price.

  The price, equivalent to a bulk power cost of $65 per megawatt hour, is far 
higher than the
  average price of power for 27 of the 31 months in which California's market 
has been
  deregulated. But in June and July, the average price of power obtained by 
the utility from a
  state-sanctioned energy auction rose to 12 cents and 10.5 cents, 
respectively, compared
  with the 2.3 cents and 2.8 cents charged in those months a year earlier.

  Passed directly through to customers,the resulting bills sparked a near 
mutiny. The
  rate-cap measure applies to residential and small commercial customers, as 
well as to
  schools and hospitals.

  In addition to the rate cap, which can be adjusted upward or downward by 
the California
  Public Utilities Commission until December 2002, the legislature earmarked 
$150 million of
  general-fund revenue, which can be used to subsidize San Diego power costs 
if they greatly
  exceed the 6.5-cents-per-kilowatt-hour rate. For now, the utility would be 
expected to make
  up any difference between revenue collected and the actual cost.

  Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, parent of San Diego Gas & Electric 
Co., said the
  rate-cap measure is "deeply flawed" because it limits the amount prices can 
rise but sets
  no floor. That means any shortfall could grow -- without a mechanism for 
customers to pay
  it down -- until the end of the rate-cap period, which could last until 
December 2002 or
  December 2003.

  Mr. Baum said Sempra stands to suffer an undercollection of perhaps $664 
million, provided
  future prices approximate the New York Mercantile Exchange forward prices 
through
  December 2002. "It's irreparably damaging to Sempra," he said because it 
"creates
  tremendous uncertainty" that makes it hard for the San Diego energy company 
to finance
  new projects such as a new transmission line.

  The legislature also appeared likely to approve a bill speeding up the 
permit process for the
  construction of new power plants, in part by beefing up staffs of 
regulatory agencies that
  review the plans.

Reliant Energy: Splitting Business in Two to Maximize Shareholder Value
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

Reliant Energy announced the top-level executives for the two companies=20
that will emerge from its planned separation into two stand-alone, publicly=
=20
separated companies. Steve Letbetter will serve as chairman and CEO of=20
the unregulated company. David McClanahan has been named president and=20
CEO of the regulated company, which will be created at the time of the=20
business separation. In July, Reliant Energy announced plans to separate=20
into two publicly traded companies in order to separate its unregulated=20
businesses from its regulated businesses. Following regulatory approval,=20
the company plans an initial public offering (IPO) of approximately 20=20
percent of the common stock of its unregulated operations by early 2001.

ANALYSIS: In June 1999, Texas adopted legislation to allow retail competiti=
on=20
beginning on Jan. 1, 2002, for the majority of customers within the state.=
=20
Senate Bill 7 mandated that utilities in the state construct firewalls=20
between their operating companies. In other words, Texas utilities must=20
have separate companies=01*with separate financial records=01*for energy se=
rvices,=20
distribution, generation, etc. In Texas, incumbent utilities must establish=
=20
affiliated retail units that will serve customers who do not switch, but=20
these units must be completely separate from the T&D operation of the=20
incumbent=20
utility. At first, Reliant Energy resisted this mandate and lobbied to=20
keep its operations under one company. Thus, it was somewhat of a surprise=
=20
when Reliant announced in July that not only would it be splitting into=20
two publicly traded companies, but also that it would be issuing an IPO=20
for the unregulated side of its operations. Currently, as one company with=
=20
both regulated and unregulated operations, Reliant (NYSE: REI) is trading=
=20
at about $45 13/16 (at market close on 10/11). Reliant has declined to=20
make any projections about pricing of the IPO of its unregulated businesses=
,=20
which it expects to issue in early 2001, until it submits an S1 filing=20
with the SEC later this year. Reliant expects the IPO to be followed by=20
a distribution to shareholders of the remaining stock of the unregulated=20
company (within 12 months of the IPO).

Reliant's motivations to divide itself into two companies are pretty=20
straightforward.=20
On one hand, the company is simply complying with the regulatory mandates=
=20
of Texas. Yet, more importantly, Reliant is turning the mandate into a=20
financial opportunity by establishing two public companies with dramaticall=
y=20
different risk / reward profiles. The unregulated side will include such=20
businesses as power generation, marketing and trading, telecom, and the=20
European operations. The regulated side will include the businesses related=
=20
to electricity and natural-gas distribution as well as the company's U.S.=
=20
interstate pipelines.

Reliant is a company that is seeking to maximize the opportunities that=20
deregulation is offering, both in the United States and internationally.=20
As an international energy delivery and energy services company, Reliant=20
makes about $15 billion in annual revenue and has assets totaling $30=20
billion.=20
The company's wholesale energy trading and marketing business is arguably=
=20
within the top five (definitely within the top 10) in the United States,=20
supported by its nearly 27,000 MW of power generation assets.=20

As the company continues to transform itself from a traditional utility=20
into an aggressive energy services company, it recognizes that its=20
traditional=20
investors have tended to be fairly risk averse, preferring to invest in=20
the regulated activities of a conservative utility company. As Reliant=20
attempts to penetrate new competitive markets, it intends to make itself=20
an appealing investment opportunity for investors who are more "growth=20
oriented and tolerant of risk," (as described by Letbetter). The most=20
practical=20
way to maximize shareholder interest and boost stock value is for Reliant=
=20
to bifurcate its operations, offering two options for capital investment.=
=20


It's a trend that is becoming more common in the energy industry, especiall=
y=20
with regard to high-risk ventures. For instance, Southern Company just=20
closed the IPO of its aggressive subsidiary Southern Energy (NYSE: SOE)=20
on Oct. 3. Southern Energy, a global energy company, has become one of=20
Southern Company's primary moneymakers (in the second-quarter alone, the=20
subsidiary reported $93 million in earnings). When the IPO of Southern=20
Energy closed, it brought total gross proceeds and a concurrent securities=
=20
of approximately $1.81 billion to its parent. Southern Energy's current=20
stock price is running at $29 1/8 (at market close on 10/11). The IPO price=
=20
of Southern Energy on 9/27 was $22. Another example is Northern States=20
Power (now part of Xcel Energy since it merged with New Century Energies),=
=20
which this June spun off a portion of its NRG Energy subsidiary, an=20
independent=20
power producer. (See IssueAlert from 10/2/00 for more information). In=20
addition, the trend is visible in other industries as well. AT&T recently=
=20
announced its plans to spin off its customer long-distance business to=20
shareholders.

However, even though the financial rewards of such an IPO are enticing,=20
there are possible downsides to such a move as well. Moody's raised serious=
=20
concerns about Reliant's announcement in particular. Specifically, Moody's=
=20
says that Reliant's regulated unit could be left with heavy debt loads=20
after the structural split, which would hurt its own quality and bond=20
ratings.=20
Moody's has put both Reliant Energy Inc. and at least two of its subsidiari=
es=20
on watch for possible downgrade from their Baa 1 status. Reliant remains=20
on watch for possible downgrade as of Oct. 11. Another risk is that as=20
more spin offs of non-generation units become commonplace, they may lose=20
their appeal on Wall Street. The average first-day gain for similar energy=
=20
IPOs was 43 percent in the third quarter, compared to 96.5 percent in the=
=20
first quarter, perhaps indicating that Wall Street is already becoming=20
less enamored with this strategy.

Yet, these risks aren't dissuading Reliant from moving forward with its=20
plan. As the company retains but moves beyond its traditional electricity=
=20
and natural-gas distribution businesses, Reliant's focus is to expand its=
=20
current business portfolio. By splitting its two operations in two, Reliant=
=20
can separate its vastly different regulated and unregulated cultures. The=
=20
companies require totally different management approaches, one based more=
=20
in regulatory relations and the other driven by entrepreneurial spirit.=20
The freedom Reliant gains from spinning off its operations into two separat=
e=20
businesses=01*one high risk, one low risk=01*appears to make this a smart m=
ove,=20
at least for now.

Subject: Re: FERC INVESTIGATION IN CA - What should they be looking for?  

Here are some more thoughts:
FERC should take a hard look at why the ISO is almost always in an "inc" 
situation in real time.  Without structural incentives to go short into real 
time, I would expect the CAISO to "inc" in some hours and "dec" in others -- 
with no consistent patterns.
The IOU's have four choices for purchasing power:  PX Block Forward, PX Day 
Ahead, PX Day Of, and CAISO Ex Post.  They had ample opportunity to purchase 
lower cost power in the PX Block Forward but didn't buy enough.  That left 
them short in the Day Ahead.  They can reduce Day Ahead prices by moving some 
of their load to the Ex Post market.  Dave Parquet did an Econ 101 
presentation on this incentive at the CAISO board meeting in June.
The ISO remains primarily in "inc" mode even during the shoulder months when 
prices are lower, another indicator that the real time "inc" problem is 
driven by the load side rather than the supply side.  The IOU's continue to 
go short into the ISO Ex Post market even when the CAISO Ex Post price is 
consistently above the PX Day Ahead price.
There is evidence that the IOU's are not willing to pay above the CAISO price 
cap for energy from the PX in the Day Ahead market.  Does it matter that the 
price cap for the ISO also acts as a PX price cap?
The NOx market in California is very tight.  How has this contributed to 
higher costs and has the complete lack of available NOx credits prevented any 
generators from running?
How large was the impact of the below normal water year on the supply side?  
The attached presentation quantifies this effect in the Northwest.  (I have a 
theory on how hydro capacity completely overstates reserve margins in the 
west from an economic perspective.  I can go into more detail if you wish.)
Friction between California PX and ISO markets and other western markets.  
For example, why are actual flows going into the state yet prices out side of 
the state are higher?  Another example of anomylous behavior is at COB on 
8/11 and 8/12.  There was congestion from California TO the northwest those 
days in the Day Ahead market.  In real time the NW ended up being a net 
seller of about 3,000 MW from the NW TO California.
Demand Side - we really need to press on this issue because all of the 
proponents of price caps claim that as soon as the demand side is "workably 
competitive" then there is no need for price caps.  Is large-scale economic 
demand response required for a competitive market?  What if demand response 
is there, but at very high prices?  The demand response in California is a 
joke.  With 2700 MW of interuptible, why did the utilities and the CAISO only 
get around 600 MW of economic demand response.  Much of this response comes 
at $1500/MWh.  The assymetric treatment of supply side resources and demand 
side resources can be justified on environmental grounds, but not economic 
grounds.  So why this assymetric treatment?  This gets to the question of the 
fine line between "scarcity rents" which are ok, and market power which is 
not.  If power is scarce, and demand truly values it at $1500/MWh then 
shouldn't that be the price.  At what price would the rest of the 
interuptible load economically curtail?  Bottom line -- there are about 2,000 
MW of load that should be able to respond to price signals that chooses not 
to or values power at more than $1500/MWh.
Burden of proof -- what empirical measures should be used to assess market 
power?  The reports published to date have been unimpressive.  The Market 
Analysis Unit report, for example, does a bunch of handwaving and then 
concludes that there is market power.  But they never explain why.  I would 
think that proof might be something like this:  Generator X sets price y% of 
the time when loads exceed Z MWs.  Or, four generators set price 80% of the 
time when prices exceed $200/MWh.  They have all the data to be able to tell, 
yet they don't provide any empirical measures.  The only test I've heard of 
so far is the UC Energy Institute report that demonstrates that generators 
are submitting bids above their marginal cost.  The PX report states that 
supply bids are fewer and at higher prices than last year.  They fail to 
mention the fact that there are 5,000 fewer MW of hydro this year relative to 
last.

Subject: FERC INVESTIGATION IN CA - What should they be looking for?

As we begin to meet with FERC Staff on the Wholesale market issues related to 
CA problems, I think that we need to put together a list of questions that 
FERC needs to be asking Western power market participants.  

The following are some questions that I think are important to have FERC ask; 
I'm sure there are more.

1. Were California utilities underscheduling load into the PX day ahead 
market?  
2. How many MWs did the CA ISO procure during each hour during the Summer 
2000?  How does this compare with CA ISO procurement during 1999?
3. Has PG&E changed its bidding behavior associated with its Hydro facilities 
in 2000?  
3. Are there baseload facilities that were operated differently in 2000 than 
in 1999?
4. Were any generation plants off-line due to unplanned maintenance during 
Summer 2000?
5. How did the CA ISO demand side program work?  Why didn't more load 
participate?  
6. What options did SDG&E have to "hedge" its retail rates?  What were prices 
in the CAL PX block forward market on Jan 15, 2000 and May 15, 2000?
7. How high did natural gas prices go in California for generation during 
Summer 2000?
8. Were other Western power markets prices higher (year-on-year)?
9. Did the CA ISO Board face political pressure to reduce bid caps?  Is this 
appropriate for a FERC jurisdictional entity?
10. What specific details is SDG&E referring to in its Complaint on 
"unworkably competitive" CA ISO markets?  Can these be fixed "quickly"?

Please add other questions.

Jim

		 Subject: DECEMBER 2000 EIS BILLING STATEMENTS / s100061.xls

PLEASE E-MAIL BILLING ISSUES TO "CLIFFORD.JACKSON@ENRON.COM" OR AS SPECIFIED 
BELOW:

Attached are spreadsheets with the detail supporting the expenses for all the 
various services provided by Enron Information Services. 

Phone charges:  Phones are being charged to the person's company and cost 
center where possible; otherwise to the rent location.  If you are being 
charged for phones/lines/services, etc. not belonging to you, or the room 
number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, please contact 
the Notes Mail ID "Move-Team" or move-team@enron.com and place a request for 
the disconnection of that line, hardware, or service.

Data connections:  One connection is being charged for each room instead of 
one connection for each port in a room.

EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, 
and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&T 
calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in 
EB, 2AC, 3AC, or JF.  For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by 
Tammy Anderson for this purpose.  

People-specific services are billed to the company and cost center 
corresponding to the employee's SAP company and department. Video conference 
usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings are based on 
a company and cost center furnished by the resource using the service.

EIS bills services on a one month lag.  We take a snapshot of the Corporate 
Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha 
phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the SAP company and cost center 
for each employee.  This snapshot is taken about the 21st of each month for 
use as a source for billing information.  

If the billings are incorrect, generally speaking either the rent should be 
corrected by contacting FMS/EPSC or the person should be moved to the correct 
SAP company/cost center by contacting an HR representative.

Attached are some late night thoughts on the portal.  Most of this is 
focussed on the portal for opinion leaders, but some of it could be 
applicable to the comemrcial portal as well.

Could you forward this to Palmer ... for some reason my address book doesn't 
pull him up when I'm off the system.

I believe it is timely to discuss this again and I agree with Cynthia that 
stand alone legislation does nothing to address the essential transmission 
structural issues.

I am open minded on the issue if someone can make a compelling case to 
support stand alone legislation, BUT my gut reaction is that it would be  a 
serious mistake.  Congress would happily put off dealing with this issue for 
years if it passes reliability only legislation.  I think the legislation 
itself makes little or no progress on our issues and may even set us back on 
making progress at FERC and in other fora.

I realize that if this gets going it may be hard to stop, but it would be 
such a cynically ineffective approach to the real reliability problems that 
we should help whomever we can to put a stop to it.  If it gets through 
committee, I have no confidence in this Congress to actually amend it into 
something better and broader, so, again, I have difficulty seeing why we 
should go that route.

I look forward to the discussion.

Joe:  thanks.  Allison is arranging a brief (thirty minutes) Conference Call 
for sometime tomorrow  so we can assure that we are all on the same page on 
this issue.  Although we had supported the policy agreement, we had been on 
record to oppose for political reasons the bill's movement on a stand-alone 
basis since policing the grid does nothing to address the essential 
transmission structural changes the market is crying to have addressed in 
order to provide reliability.  However, given Jeff Brown's efforts, the 
political need for inoculation and other political developments, it is timely 
to once again discuss Enron's position.  I look forward to our call sometime 
tomorrow. Cynthia

Subject: Stand-alone Reliability Legislation


Joe,

It is my understanding that you were on the call for a short time this
morning of the group dealing with reliability language.  The discussion
covered the chances of stand-alone reliability legislation.

Where do you stand on this issue?

As you are aware, ELCON has been opposed to any kind of stand-alone
legislation -- including reliability.  At first, we were not strongly
opposed to the stand-alone reliability piece.  However, we have become more
opposed as time has passed and we have seen how the vertically-integrated
recalcitrant utilities have been able dominate NERC and stifle any
progressive market-oriented movement.  We think things would be as bad --
if not worse -- with the stand-alone creation of NAERO.  The establishment
of NAERO -- alone -- would not be good for the development of markets.

Given this, we are concerned about how things are going.  However, we
aren't doing much on our own since we would be very ineffective.  We are
open to ideas.

John

John Brindle, David Cromley and others in the Corporate Business Controls 
group (formerly part of EBS) have been working over the last several weeks to 
make sure that we can get our people out of Dabhol if there are threats to 
their safety.  While no plan is perfectly reliable (particularly during 
monsoon season) we believe that we are as ready as we can be.

Subject: Enron Expatriates in India

Steve,

I wanted to give you the latest figures on Enron expatriates in India.  There 
are currently 19 Enron expatriate employees based in India, accompanied by 
six dependants.  In addition, Enron has responsibility for 15 expatriate 
contractors working for DPC and Lingtec, primarily at Dabhol.  The total of 
40 expatriates for whom Enron is directly responsible is broken down by 
location as follows:  21 in Mumbai, 16 at Dabhol, and three in Baroda.  By 
company, they are broken down as follows:  Enron India -  eight plus three 
dependants; EOGIL - nine plus one dependant; EBS - one plus two dependants; 
DPC - seven; and Lingtec - nine.  These figures are likely to continue to 
trend downward; Jane Wilson's departure on Friday, for example, will reduce 
the Enron India expatriate presence to seven plus three dependants.

We are confident that the evacuation plan now in place provides the best 
possible prospect of successfully evacuating all of these expatriates in the 
event of danger.  As a contingency, the plan also includes the evacuation of 
all 137 expatriates working at the Dabhol site, although a large-scale 
evacuation from Dabhol is more problematic, especially now that the monsoon 
season has started.  A coordinated plan was needed since the limited number 
of available helicopters meant that the evacuation plans drawn up by 
individual contractors such as Bechtel were all drawing upon the same 
resources.

As you know, Enron's security situation in India remains stable.  We are in 
the final stages of implementing security upgrades for our employees and 
offices there.

Dave

I got a voicemail fro Ken.  He would be happy to meet with Freeman.  He is 
willing to work on other times, but suggested the following
After 3:00 on May 2nd (right after Ken's speech to the RGA) or late the day 
before or in the morning of the second (to do this though he would have to 
cancel his speech to the Texas Governor's business council but he is willing 
to do this if necessary)
His least preferred alternative in this general time frame would be early 
morning on the third.
Jeff -- could you coordinate with Rosie to get the time and place nailed 
down?

Ginger - please forward this to all of GA.  Thanks.

This is a request for help from my colleagues in GA.  I am preparing Enron's 
comments to the Federal Trade Commission concerning the results of different 
"regulatory approaches" by states implementing retail electric competition 
programs or legislation.  The FTC has invited comments on a number of 
specific issues, but their goal is to "examine various state retail 
competition programs and describe those features that have resulted in 
consumer benefits and those that have not yielded consumer benefits."  

There are some obvious areas where we'll comment - California - but I'd 
appreciate people sending me specific examples of good or bad regulatory 
policies in other states.   Also, does anyone know of any good reports or 
analyses already prepared on these issues?   Thanks.  -Bob

Apologized that she could not meet with Steve yesterday.  She would like to 
have this meeting.  She asked that we schedule this for your next trip to 
DC.  I think we should do this meeting soon.  Do you want me to get on her 
calendar and then build a day of meetings around her meeting?  Or wait until 
you are otherwise back in town?

     Dan & Steve,
     
        This meeting is scheduled to be held on Friday 1 December at 
     McDonalds Headquarters in just outside of Chicago. People are flying 
     in Thursday night and we plan to go through most of Friday - maybe 
     with a tour of Hamburger University. The participants are General 
     Motors, Dupont, McDonalds, NASA, and hopefully Enron. I will be 
     traveling on Tuesday, but could we arrange a time to discuss this on 
     Wednesday?

The Honorable James Hoecker
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

Washington, D.C.

Re: Electric Power Industry Reform

Dear Chairman Hoecker:

We are consumers or represent consumers of electric power.  We write to urg=
e=20
you and your colleagues to take the initiative to address the intolerable=
=20
shortages and extreme price volatility that have become all too common in t=
he=20
electric power industry.  It is imperative that the Federal Energy Regulato=
ry=20
Commission proceed expeditiously with the reforms needed to support a=20
competitive and efficient power supply industry to ensure a reliable supply=
=20
of power at the lowest possible cost to consumers.

There are many actions you and your colleagues should take to ensure that t=
he=20
power supply in the U.S. remains sufficient and is available at reasonable=
=20
prices.  For example, you and your colleagues should remove roadblocks in t=
he=20
nation=01,s electricity gird.  Under the current system, FERC regulations a=
llow=20
many companies that own transmission systems to restrict access to their=20
transmission lines by competing electricity suppliers.  The result of this=
=20
policy is shortages, blackouts and skyrocketing prices.  Like the interstat=
e=20
highway system, FERC should allow electricity to move from one state to=20
another just as freely as motorists do.  All electricity suppliers should=
=20
have the same access to the transmission lines in order to transport power =
to=20
where it is most needed.

FERC should also discourage electricity suppliers=01, reliance on spot and=
=20
short-term electricity markets for power supply.  Instead, FERC should urge=
=20
suppliers to purchase a portion of their power needs under long-term=20
contracts.  Locking in electricity costs at fixed prices protects consumers=
=20
from unexpected price swings that can be financially devastating.

We strongly urge you and your colleagues to seize the initiative on these=
=20
reforms.  Consumers deserve a power supply industry that is both more=20
reliable and economical.=20

Very truly yours,

I spoke with Philip today and he is confirmed for dinner at Brennan's.  He is 
holding back on commiting to Enron mainly to preserve his geographic

I would hate to lose him for these personal reasons.  I have an idea about

		 Subject: Bush Energy Policy & Powder River Basin

Hello Steve,  I hope you and your family had a great holiday.  Steve, I heard 
on a talk show that the Bush Energy Policy would tackle such topics as 
Alaskan Gas, ANWR and also would mention the Powder River coal bed methane 
play.  I would like to get a copy of the Energy Policy when it becomes 
available.   I would also like everyone to be aware of the large investments 
made and planned by Northern Border Partners in the Powder River and Wind 
River Basins of Wyoming.  In addition, the Denver office of Enron North 
America has a large stake in gas trading in the Rockies.   Everything 
considered, the development of Rocky Mountain gas reserves, including the 
gathering and pipeline infrastructure will be less controversial than ANWR 
and will get gas to markets much sooner.  For example, Northern Border 
Partners expects to file at the FERC by the 3rd quarter of 2001 for the Bison 
Pipeline project which will connect Powder River reserves to NBPL in 2003 
(versus 2007 for Alaskan gas).  You can see the latest on the Bison project 
at Inside FERC, December 18th page 5.

One pending federal action that would do much to enhance coal bed methane 
production, is the completion of an EIS  presently being prepared by the 
BLM.   The timely issuance of a favorable EIS would open thousands of federal 
acres in Wyoming and Montana to drilling by coal bed methane producers and 
would assist gas in getting to market within Bush's first term in office.    
I hope Enron and the new administration can set Powder River gas as a 
priority item in the coming year !

Subject: Red Herring Article


Jeff,

I was recently skimming the Enron news articles on Yahoo Finance and saw this 
one published in Red Herring about the sad demise of the renewable energy 
business in California:

http://www.redherring.com/index.asp?layout=story&doc_id=1040018104&channel=100
00001

I thought the article was reasonable until I got to a certain part about the 
impact that recent high prices have had on these companies and Enron was 
mentioned in a rather improper light, in my opinion.  Below is a short 
excerpt from the article with a particular sentence highlighted concerning 
Enron:

"Proponents of renewable power viewed California's deregulation as flawed 
from the onset three years ago. Still, they anticipated that with adequate 
publicity millions of consumers could be persuaded to switch from the 
traditional power supply, which comes mainly from the more polluting fossil 
fuels and nuclear power, and that the demand would spur supply. The number of 
producers and retailers getting into the green market would then only grow -- 
as long as the big utilities didn't interfere.

That's what almost happened. Over the last three years, retailers like Green 
Mountain Energy and Utility.com bought green power already available in 
California and started to invest in building their own renewable energy 
generators, like windmill farms and large solar-panel assemblies. Still, for 
all the optimism and effort, only about 200,000 customers -- less than 1 
percent of the 8.5 million households that had the option of switching 
providers -- chose to support them. Many of those were swayed by a 
deregulation-mandated credit of 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour for consumers who 
switched. When natural gas prices were high, the credit actually represented 
a real savings. Historically, environmentally conscious consumers have paid a 
penny or two more per kilowatt hour for renewable energy, along with an 
average monthly surcharge of $5.

Then, last fall, the fledgling industry started to crumble. Energy 
wholesalers like Enron (NYSE: ENE) and Calpine (NYSE: CPN) responded to a 
rising demand for energy by raising their prices from 6 cents per kilowatt 
hour to as much as $1.50. Green retailers had trouble getting credit to buy 
power. Many chose to drop out of the market rather than have to charge a 
price that was less than their cost. When the energy crisis hit, many green 
consumers' bills more than doubled."

In light of the recent e-mail that was sent out, I thought that I would bring 
this to your attention as it may warrant a response to bring clarity that 
Enron does not raise prices, it transacts in a market where prices are set by 
supply and demand.  The average person reading this could very easily come to 
the conclusion that Calpine and Enron broke the back of the renewable energy 
companies, which is clearly not the case.  Nonetheless, thought you might 
find this of interest.

The agenda I'm trying to put together for the next meeting will include the 
customary presentations from Davies/Lindsay and Kristol as well as the energy 
policy discussion we are looking for from you and Bob.

We will also be updating the council on Enron Networks - - a business unit 
formed to extend Enron's business model to other industries (especially 
commodities or "commoditzable" goods).   Most recently we have extended into 
metals, expanded our presence in paper, and begun an examination of 
agricultural commodities.  I'd like your help in identifying a guest 
participant who may help us think through some of the issues from either (or 
both) of two perspectives:

business strategy:  what markets are candidates for commoditization.  (I have 
asked Gary Hamel to consider this topic as well).

public policy:  as more businesses adopt online business models (like 
exchanges), as more goods are bought and sold like commodities, and as more 
transactions move off the traditional regulated exchanges, how are policy 
makers (SEC, FTC, CFTC and their overseas counterparts) likely to react?

The underlying assumptions for the resources are that they return to some 
business as usual amortization of these assets (a 20 to 30 year amortization) 
assuming that none of the generating assets are uneconomic.  Further, it 
assumes non-revenue earning regulatory assets (other than the TRA 
undercollections) are amortized over the next 5 years.

Subject: Idea


AEP, ComEd, Duke and CP&L announced last week that they would be 
collaborating on a new version of a net based system better than OASIS.  I 
think that Enron should consider joining with these utilities on this.  There 
may be substantial Enron upside to such a venture from added information 
disclosure and standardization and streamlining for easier use:

On 7/14, FERC issued an Advance NOPR asking for input by 2/15/01 on OASIS 
Phase II (the new OASIS proposal).  In particular, FERC states that this new 
OASIS should address: (i) communication of critical market information (like 
transmission rights); (ii) posting of ATC, TTC, and CBM; and (ii) seams 
issues between RTOs (transmission service across multiple RTOs).  FERC says 
that the new OASIS should make use of Internet, interactive displays, etc.  
FERC also asks for information on dynamic notification (where the OASIS 
automatically alerts the customer to changes in ATC, reservations, etc.)  
This type of functionality would allow Enron to determine if it wants to stay 
in a queue when transmission becomes available (rather than getting kicked 
out after the first denial for lack of ATC.)  FERC also wants information on 
whether generator-run status should be included on OASIS; electronic 
scheduling (which can now be done via etag); and business practices that 
should be standardized.
Enron could have significant input to force these utilities to propose a 
good, customer friendly system that provides valid and helpful data on ATC, 
TTC, and CBM, rather than the total lack of substantive information that is 
available today.  (Recall that Enron proposed that CBM use be posted--FERC 
has not adopted that idea yet.)
Because these are critical utilities, any system that they propose may be 
very likely to be adopted (with some changes).  I think it is better to be in 
on the front end.  Enron's participation would also give validity to their 
system.
Dan Larcamp told me that he would like more "classes" for his staff from 
Enron and that we should give joint classes with AEP because Susan Tomasky 
told Dan L. that "AEP has nothing to hide."  This type of venture would allow 
AEP one venue to make good on that statement.
Steve K. asked us to pursue the idea that Enron build a computer system.  
This may be a good way to have significant input while leveraging these 
companies' money and promoting Enron's congestion model ideas, etc.

Subject: Bahamas LNG

Steve --

In a discussion today with Mike, Kelly, etc., it was apparent that the Public 
Affairs team viewed the Bahamas LNG transaction quite cautiously.  Given the 
recent issues power plant development has had in Florida (big political 
fights that are going the wrong way), I was wondering if it made sense to 
bring together a meeting of all of Public Affairs and the deal team to 
analyze the implications of our development plans.  My primary worry is that 
P/L under water could have severe ecological implications that are not being 
internalized into the transaction.

I would like to try and arrange a meeting to (1) ensure Public Affairs 
coordination and (2) understand the deal impacts better. 

Please advise if I'm worrying for no good reason.

Jim

Toronto Hydro Corporation and Ontario Power Generation announced that they=
=20
have launched an electronic business transaction (EBT) "hub" that will=20
provide centralized electronic data management and transaction services=20
to local distribution companies (LDCs) and energy retailers in Ontario.=20
Called EBT Express, the exchange will become operational when Ontario's=20
new competitive electricity market opens next spring. Excelergy eXACT=01v,=
=20
developed by energy software solutions company Excelergy Corporation, will=
=20
provide the technology infrastructure for EBT Express.

ANALYSIS: This is a significant development, as EBT Express represents=20
the first hub in Canada for retail energy transactions. The site will serve=
=20
as the central clearinghouse for immediate communication of customer data=
=20
among hundreds of LDCs and energy retailers in Ontario, and possibly=20
throughout=20
Canada.  I spoke yesterday afternoon with George Caraghiaur, Exelergy's=20
vice president, Canada, about EBT Express. Caraghiaur believes that the=20
site "will provide the essential technology for opening Ontario's electrici=
ty=20
market in an efficient manner." That is no small undertaking as there are=
=20
an expected 300 players that will need to communicate with each other in=20
Ontario once competition begins.

Deregulation is happening in Canada on a province-by-province basis (much=
=20
like it is happening state-by-state in the U.S.). Thus far, only Ontario=20
and Alberta have set dates when electric customers will be able to select=
=20
a new energy supplier. Ontario is scheduled to become competitive next=20
spring, and presently is the only region in which EBT Express will be=20
operational.=20
Alberta uses a point-to-point transaction process, which represents a very=
=20
complex model. Caraghiaur believes that the value of EBT Express will be=20
clearly seen, and there will be many opportunities for the hub in Alberta=
=20
and elsewhere.

The Ontario Energy Board (OEB), which is the equivalent of a state PUC,=20
mandated the use of electronic business transactions (EBTs). The EBTs work=
=20
as follows: Once a customer selects a new energy supplier, the energy=20
supplier=20
and the local distribution company (LDC) must continue to share information=
=20
about that customer. This proprietary data, shared strictly on a one-to-one=
=20
basis between the energy supplier and the LDC only, will include billing,=
=20
usage and payment information. Essentially, an LDC will read the meter=20
and send usage information to the energy supplier, who will calculate its=
=20
portion of a customer's bill and in turn send this data back to the LDC,=20
which will submit the customer bill. This represents a common way for billi=
ng=20
in Ontario, although there are other options including consolidated billing=
=20
that originates from the energy supplier and split billing coming from=20
both the LDC and energy supplier. No customer information will be exchanged=
=20
until competition officially begins in Ontario, which now appears to be=20
in the spring of 2001, although the technology infrastructure supplied=20
by Excelergy is already in place.

In response to the OEB's mandate, Toronto Hydro Corp. and Ontario Power=20
Generation=01*the largest players in electricity distribution and generatio=
n=20
in Ontario=01* became equity partners in the $7.7 million joint venture to=
=20
create EBT Express. All customer data will be contained within EBT Express,=
=20
which is supported by the eXACT technology. Excelergy eXACT is a software=
=20
solution that translates, validates, manages and delivers data exchanged=20
among users. The functionality of eXACT has been used in several U.S. state=
s,=20
including Pennsylvania and New Jersey. In fact, eXACT was introduced to=20
gas and electricity retailers in the United States in 1999 as a component=
=20
of Excelergy ABP=01v, a billing and customer information solution. Alleghen=
y=20
Energy Supply, a subsidiary of Allegheny Energy, was one U.S. utility that=
=20
I know of that used the Excelergy technology.=20

Caraghiaur contends that EBT Express will play an important role in enhanci=
ng=20
the competitive market in Ontario. "There are presently 37 licensed retaile=
rs=20
in Ontario, 15 pending retailers and 246 LDCs," Caraghiaur told me. "You=20
can imagine the cloud of communication pathways that would occur between=20
all these players without a centralized hub such as EBT Express." The numbe=
r=20
of LDCs seemed awfully high to me, but Caraghiaur explained that in Ontario=
=20
many LDCs serve only a small number of customers, often 100 customers or=20
less. This should change as consolidation reduces the number of LDCs in=20
Ontario but, when compared to the United States, Ontario still will have=20
a comparatively high number of distribution companies.=20

Caraghiaur cited Pennsylvania as an example of a market that has tried=20
to assimilate communication among many market participants. Pennsylvania,=
=20
along with most other U.S. states, still uses electronic data interchange=
=20
(EDI) as its standard, wherein every LDC has a slightly different=20
interpretation=20
of data that is shared through the EDI. This can often cause communication=
=20
inconsistencies and retailers may have a difficult time in getting ready=20
for deregulation. "EBT Express will be in the position to enforce standards=
,"=20
says Caraghiaur. "The use of XML in particular will enhance communication=
=20
between market participants."

In fact, XML (extensible market language) is the cornerstone of eXACT as=20
it constructs a standardized language so that data can be exchanged but=20
still understood by different applications. Caraghiaur claims that Excelerg=
y=20
is on the forefront of XML technology, which was expressly stipulated in=20
the EBT standards developed by the Advisory Committee to the Ontario Energy=
=20
Board. XML is a common language used on the Internet that makes it easier=
=20
and more cost-effective for buyers and sellers to exchange data between=20
applications and data sources that otherwise might have been incompatible.=
=20
In addition, Excelergy's eXACT software is object-oriented, allowing for=20
easy and rapid change from one program to another.=20

Clearinghouse exchanges are definitely a trend in the energy industry.=20
Whereas states that previously deregulated, such as California and=20
Pennsylvania,=20
did not use a centralized clearinghouse for customer information, states=20
and provinces now formulating their restructuring plans often mandate them.=
=20
For instance, Excelergy's competitor Logica has a market data clearinghouse=
=20
built for the Midwest market. Also, the ERCOT-ISO has teamed with Andersen=
=20
Consulting on a similar market data clearinghouse for the Texas unbundling,=
=20
scheduled for pilot in the summer of 2001 and full market opening in Januar=
y=20
2002.

One concern that market participants may have is the sharing of customer=20
data through EBT Express, especially when it is backed by potential=20
competitors=20
in the Ontario market such as Toronto Hydro and Ontario Power. Caraghiaur=
=20
responded to this by saying that the OEB mandated the exchange of customer=
=20
information through an EBT structure. However, market participants are=20
not mandated to participate in EBT Express. They could opt to still exchang=
e=20
information on a point-to-point basis, although Caraghiaur believes that=20
EBT Express offers a much more efficient forum for the transfer of customer=
=20
data. In addition, Caraghiaur reiterated that no proprietary or competitive=
=20
information would be accessible between any parties other than the LDC=20
and energy supplier involved in the exchange.

Interestingly, Toronto Hydro and Ontario Power may be competitors when=20
the Ontario market opens next year. Toronto Hydro Corp. owns Toronto=20
Hydro-Electric=20
System Limited, a regulated electricity distribution system, and Toronto=20
Hydro Energy Services, a competitive energy service company. Ontario Power=
=20
Generation is an electricity generating company, so Toronto Hydro and Ontar=
io=20
Power will be competing on the retail level to acquire energy supply=20
contracts=20
with lucrative customers. And rumor has it that venerable retail giant=20
Sears is also taking a look into becoming an energy retailer in Canada=20
next year. As Canada continues to deregulate and attract energy suppliers,=
=20
Excelergy anticipates that the EBT Express could serve a national market.

I sent this to Rick Shapiro and Mark Palmer as well.  This is an ad created 
for use in the Ontario market and would include the logos of the signatory 
companies (rather than individual signatures).Aleck Dadson worked with GPC on 
its creation.  It is part of the total plan, which includes Ken Lay's visit 
to Toronto April 4 to meet with media and government leaders.

Give me your thoughts.

It's a hoax..  This e-mail made it into a reporter's hands and the reporter 
asked about this in the Clinton-Lazio debates in NY.  CNN covered the hoax 
the next day.

The US Postal Service denied it, of course. By the way, I have never seen a

Morten, congratulations on the first power deal in Japan for Enron and the 
first power derivative transaction in Japan.

Mention should also be made of the significant support from Mike Grimes and 
Mark Crowther.

Mike lead a team that included legal, credit, accounting and tax, to put 
together a standard electricity purchase and sale agreement for Japan which 
was used as the basis for the NCC contract.

Mark played a large role in addressing the technical aspects of the NCC 
contract. He also had a significant role in the drafting of the Japanese 
version of the contract.

kind regards

		 Subject: NCC Power Deal - First electricity transaction

Dear all,

Enron Japan did today their first power transaction, and the first power 
derivative transaction ever in Japan. The counterpart is Nippon Chemi-Con 
Kabushiki Kaisha (NCC).

The term of the deal is 01/04/02-31/3/06, with a yearly volume of around 
110,000 MWh

The basic structure of the electricity transaction is that Enron Japan gives 
the counterpart a 6,8% discount on their actual electricity bill for the 
period 1/4/01-31/3/02. This discount, or the option premium, gives Enron the 
right but not the obligation to supply NCC with Electricity for the 4 yearly 
supply terms starting 1/4/02, 1/4/03, 1/4/04 and 1/4/05 at predefined prices. 
If Enron Japan decide to supply NCC with Electricity for a specific supply 
term, we need to inform them 2 months before the start of the supply term. 
This structure give Enron Japan the necessary flexibility to operate in a 
newly deregulated electricity market.

The deal was closed by Morten Erik Pettersen with very good support from 
Rousseau Anai (Associate Power Trading) and Jane McBride (Senior Legal 
Counsel)

Regards

Morten Erik Pettersen 
Head of Trading
Enron Japan Corp

You know I love this idea , BUT I still think we need to let Ken personally 
address the "shots" he has taken.  It is just not the same to have Jeff say 
it is okay that the AG of California wants to put Ken in a cell with Spike!  
I strongly believe we need to give Ken a forum too, as he has been at the 
center of alot of the recent noise.  I still believe a video with both of 
them is the right way to go...The State of Enron.  I think Jeff's Corner is a 
great idea too...can't we do both?  Ok, I have said this enough..I will go 
away quietly now and let the experts decide...Beth

Jeff --

Our Internal Communications group is continuing to look for ways to 
communicate with employees in a timely manner about hot topics that are of 
interest to them.  We're also looking to increase your exposure with 
employees.  We have a new idea, which Sherri discussed briefly with you a 
couple of weeks ago.  It's called "Jeff's Corner" and it will be a regular 
video message that will be posted on the intranet -- which can be accessed by 
99.9% of our employees.  

This is how it will work.  We will tape a 2-3 minute video of you talking 
about what's top of mind at that moment.  The tone and style will be like 
your floor meetings (one of your best employee venues), casual and 
conversational.  We suggest the first topic be "The State of Enron."  There 
is a lot of talk among employees about the cheap shots we've taken as a 
company and by you and Ken, about the decline in our stock price and about 
the widespread re-deployment efforts.   These recent events are  beginning to 
affect morale.  Employees are concerned and want to be assured that we're on 
the right side, that they will have jobs, that Enron will be here next year.  
You've helped reassure them about these things at recent floor meetings; 
however, that is only a small part of our global work force.  Having your own 
corner on the intranet will have a farther reach, and we have the capability 
to do this in-house at very low cost.  

We recommend making this a regular communication feature at least monthly, 
although since this would only involve a few minutes of your time, you could 
even tape a message to employees weekly.  The nice thing about this medium is 
we have the ability to respond immediately to current events, and having you 
speak to employees gives the message credibility.  

Future topics could address new cost saving procedures, update on Dabhol, the 
PRC, reasons behind an organizational announcement, The Pulse survey, etc.  
We'd like this to be a forum where you can talk about topics you'd like to 
discuss.

I've checked with the technical team, and we have the capability do this 
now.  I will check your calendar with Sherri.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.

Mary

I understood the "validation" process to be a fairly flexible name applied to 
a wide variety of approaches.  What we specifically discussed, and what scott 
s. left prepared and committed to do, involved looking at individual curves, 
the assumptions underlying them and some process (yet to be specifically 
determined) for addressing updates.  We agreed to start with the top 20 
curves and especially those which are involved in the upcoming deals.

I think the confusion is in what the term validation means.  In the ENA 
context it means one thing; in this context it means what we discussed (which 
was in Jim's memo and, as you'll recall, we went through point-by-point).  
Let's just get this done.

Scott --

We should talk about what was agreed to at the meeting.  

My discussions with others indicated that both (a) a curve validation process 
and (b) a deal-by-deal review would be undertaken.  The deal-by-deal review 
is especially critical during the implementation of a structured curve 
validation process.  In addition, even when the curve validation process is 
fully up and running, we should continue looking at major position impacts in 
new transactions.  There are many curves to review.  It seems reasonable to 
look at the critical rate curves as appropriate.

Let me know.

In the interest of clarity:  It was agreed that ongoing curve validation 
consistent with that followed on wholesale curves would be instituted.  It 
was further agreed that certain information would be provided by Scott 
Stoness to get this process going.  Such ongoing validation should make the 
impractical deal-by-deal review described below both redundant and 
unnecessary. 

I assume the list below did not contemplate the type of curve validation 
process we discussed and agreed to at the meeting.

Subject: EES - RAC Deal Approval Meeting

I received word late last week that Dave Gorte (works for Rick Buy) is 
setting up a meeting to discuss the process under which EES will have its 
deals considered by RAC.

I think that we should argue that the following package of information be 
pre-assembled and provided to Govt Affairs when EES brings a deal to RAC:

1. List of each position by utility and by rate class within the deal 

2. Regulated Rate forecasts by utility and by rate class for each position in 
the deal.  Not just the "scalars" but also the absolute $/Mwh.

3. For each impacted position, the key assumptions contained within the 
curves - 
 a. deregulation date (if any)
 b. stranded cost roll-off date (if any)
 c. standard offer end date (if any)
 d. other rate reduction dates and amounts (if any)

4. Revenue side or Cost side contract terms that impact the deal (for 
example, movement in pricing terms given some event)

I also think that we should have at least 3 working days to review this 
package.  

If anyone can think of anything else that would ease our analysis, I would be 
game.

Thanks.

Fenosa and Enron to Invest $550 Million in Dominican Republic

     Madrid, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- Union Electrica Fenosa SA,
Spain's third-biggest power company, and Enron Corp., the world's
largest energy trader, will invest together in the Dominican
Republic, kicking off the alliance by building a $550 million
power plant and re-gasification facility.
     The partners will build a natural-gas-fired power station
whose 500-megawatt capacity will represent 30 percent of the
country's current electricity demand, said Fenosa in a note,
confirmed with the company.
     The generator will run on liquefied natural gas when it
starts operating in 2002, switching to fuel from the re-
gasification plant when it starts operating in 2003.
     Fenosa has had an alliance with International Power Plc,
formerly National Power Plc, since 1998. That alliance focuses on
Europe, the U.S. and Australia, a Fenosa spokeswoman said today.
     Enron was the first U.S. utility to receive licenses to buy,
sell and import electricity in Spain, after the government started
opening energy markets to competition in 1998. It's also licensed
to market natural gas.
     The Texas-based utility is building a gas-fired power plant
in southern Spain, has a wind turbine factory near Toledo, and
plans another windmill factory in Catalonia.

DJ Union Fenosa/Enron -2: Construction To Begin 2001 >E.FEN
10/10/0 12:40 (New York)



  MADRID (Dow Jones)--Spanish electricity company Union Electrica Fenosa SA
(E.FEN) said late Tuesday it has reached an agreement with U.S. energy company
Enron (ENE) to invest in energy infrastructure projects in the Dominican
Republic.
  In a release, Fenosa said the deal involves the construction of a
combined-cycle power plant with a 500MW potency, which will use natural gas
from a regasification plant on the island nation.
  The 500MW potency is equivalent to 30% of the Caribbean island's electricity
demand.
  The deal also includes a complimentary project, Fenosa said. This is the
construction of a regasification plant on the republic's coastline, with a
capacity for treating gas equivalent to the consumption of various groups of
combined-cycle plants with a potency of 1300MW.
  The investment for these two projects is seen at around $550 million, of
which $100 million could come from Dominican companies, Fenosa said.
  Fenosa and Enron estimate that construction of the two projects will begin 
in
early 2001, with the power plant coming online in 2002. It will operate with
combustible liquid until 2003, at which time the regasification plant comes
online.

Steve,

Thank you for agreeing to speak at the ETS HR Conference.  Since we spoke 
last week, the meeting date has changed from February 20 to Monday, February 
26 to better accomodate presentors' and attendees schedules.  We have 
confirmed that this date works well for both you and Stan Horton.  On the 
26th, we will kick off the afternoon session with lunch at 12:15 PM, followed 
by your presentation from 1:30-2:30 and Stan's from 2:30-3:30.  You are 
invited to have lunch with us and spend as much time with us that afternoon 
as your schedule allows.

To follow up on our conversation last week, it would be great if you could 
talk to the group about Enron's performance in 2000, its successes and 
stumbles, and how ENE's stock price is impacted.  It would also be helpful if 
you could discuss the look of Enron in 2001, what its primary busninesses are 
and how they drive earnings; as well as what significant initiatives Enron 
has planned for 2001.  I have asked Stan to talk about ETS' performance 
during 2000, what he was pleased with and what lessons were learned.  He also 
will share his perspective on how ETS fits into Enron's plans for 2001, as 
well as what initiatives and objectives are critical to ETS' success this 
year.

Thanks again for taking time out of your schedule to spend it with the ETS HR 
team.  I look forward to seeing you on February 26.

Gary

I spoke with Ken about the Business Council.  He agreed: errors of commission 
are much better than errors of omission.  H e does want to be personally 
involved in the invitations from here on and he is very willing to make calls 
next week to help get some confirmations.  Deal directly with him . . . 
there's no need for me to be in the middle.  Also, a bit of background:  
Greenspan is always invited to the reception the night before, but they don't 
want to offer him a speaking spot because he won't speak without the press 
present.  

Thanks again for all your work on the Senate hearing.  I felt overprepared -- 
which is just how I want to feel -- and every bit of information I needed was 
at my fingertips.

 What are you doing on Labor Day? 
 
In between the hamburgers, hotdogs, homemade ice cream and occasional dip in 
the pool that many of you will undoubtedly be enjoying Monday, be sure to 
take a few minutes to turn your TV set to the Jerry Lewis Labor Day Muscular 
Dystrophy (MDA) Telethon on NBC.  At 1:10 p.m., Enron's own Linda Jenkins 
will present a $100,000 check to Jerry's Houston team.  The donation, which 
will benefit research for ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as 
Lou Gehrig's disease -- the disease Linda has been living with for the past 
three years), was raised by devoted friends and volunteers at the Enron/MDA 
Beach Bowl held in July.  

Thanks to all of you who raised money for this cause that is close to our 
hearts at Enron.   And have a happy and safe holiday.

Subject: Something to shoot at--California

Attached are three documents for your consideration:

--Q and As if there is a leak about the possible sale, but we don't want to 
admit it (qanoadmit)

--News release if the leak runs amok and it is determined that we must 
divulge--either for shareholder reasons or severe reputation 
problems/miconceptions.  (leaknr)

--Q and As to accompany news release.  I suppose another option is having a 
statement and Q and As ready without a release, but I don't think this gives 
us the control we would need.  (qaadmit)

Please review and comment by end of next week.  Thanks.

attached is Sen. Hagel's energy speech.  He focusses on oil primarily but 
also does a nice job of framing the importance of sound energy policy to our 
continued economic growth.

If you can cover it I would say yes.  It's a key race and we have been close 
to Ashcroft for years.  Let's make sure he knows we gave it.... we need to 
follow up with him.  Last time I talked to him he basically recited the 
utilities' position on electric restructuring.  Let's make it clear that we 
want to talk right after the election.

We have received a request from the Ashcroft Senate campaign for $10,000 in 
soft money. This is the race where Governor Carnahan is the challenger. Enron 
PAC has contributed $10,000 and Enron has also contributed $15,000 soft money 
in this campaign to Senator Ashcroft. Ken Lay has been personally interested 
in the Ashcroft campaign. Our polling information is that Ashcroft is 
currently leading 43 to 38 with an undecided of 19 percent. 

Do we want to make a further soft money contriubtion of $10,000?

Steve, Mark and Meredith,

Please find below some emails between EFET (European Federation of Energy 
Traders) and myself.  We have helped them to find out which German 
journalists the German gas incumbent, Ruhrgas, has sent to California this 
week.  We found out about that yesterday.  I have now passed on that list + 
some general PR recommendations and EFET will now take the lead on this (they 
will send out an EFET position paper on California and have a spokesperson 
available especially for California - he's not Enron!).

Just wanted to make sure you are aware because it could be possible that 
people will come to us for further comment.  The general consensus now is 
that we then refer them to EFET.

Thanks
Eva

Jan,

Please  see below a summary of the journalists who will be returning this 
weekend from their trip to California courtesy of Ruhrgas. 

Up to you now to send them the EFET position paper on California.  Would 
suggest you try to get it on their desk by Monday morning latest, if 
possible.  Would also send it to those who have refused to go and other key 
contacts we have given to you.  Media seems to be keen to know EFET's 
position on this.  Let me know if you need translation of the personalised 
note that will accompany the position paper. Obviously, we will divert any 
requests we get to you. Will get their email addresses to you later so you 
can email it to them rather than fax it with the possibility they will get it 
too late. 

Good luck.

Groet
Eva

Subject: journalists in California


Eva,

I've finished my guerilla-PR-job, here are the results:

Ruhrgas has invited the Nordrhein-Westfalen (region where Essen is located)
-based correspondents of the national dailies and also the energy
journalists of the most important business magazines.

Journalists in Califonia:
-Werner Sturbeck (FAZ - Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung)
-Werner Jaspert (S_ddeutsche Zeitung)
-Dr. J_rgen Frech (WAZ - Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung
-Jochen Schuster (Focus)

Journalists that had been invited but refused:
-Dr. Andreas Wildhagen (Wirtschaftswoche)
-Hans-Willy Bein (Financial Times Deutschland)
-Die Welt

I also got the information that Ruhrgas held a press conference yesterday
in California. So we can expect the first articles on California tomorrow
or latest on Monday. I also will do an additional internet monitoring (for
example WAZ, which we don't read daily) this afternoon to see if there are
already some articles.

We should recommend EFET to send their statement not only to those
journalists who have been on the press trip but to all key contacts. Most of
the journalists I spoke to or colleagues from the newsdesk seem to be keen to
know what EFET has to say about the California issue!!!!!

Please let me know if you need further information!

Sorry to bring more to you but perhaps this is something that Rob Walls could 
easily look through.  Global has a contract that is ready for signing.  
Global is involved as an investor in Razorfinish.com.  The person who is 
supposed to sign the contract is procrastinating as long as possible bec ause 
the contract is not in the interest of Enron.  I told the person not to sign 
it regardless of the pressure from Sanjay.  Hopefully, Rob could get to it.

Meet Enron, Bush's biggest contributor
Pratap Chatterjee

Copyright Progressive Incorporated Sep 2000

  Early last October, members of the ninth grade girls' track team
and the boys' football team at suburban Houston's Deer Park High
School's north campus returned from practice reporting severe
breathing problems. That day, Deer Park registered 251 parts of
ozone per billion, more than twice the federal standard, and Houston
surpassed Los Angeles as the smoggiest city in the United States.

  One of the biggest contributors to Deer Park's pollution is a plant
owned by Enron, Houston's wealthiest company. Enron and its
executives are also the single largest contributors ($550,000 and
counting) to the political ambitions of Texas Governor George W
Bush, Republican candidate for President of the United States.
Kenneth Lay, the chief executive of Enron, has personally given at
least $250,000 in soft money to Bush's political campaigns. He is
also one of the "Pioneers"-a Bush supporter who has collected
$100,000 in direct contributions of $1,000 or less.
  What is Enron? And what does it get in return for this largesse?

  Enron is the largest buyer and seller of natural gas in the
country. Its 1999 revenues of $40 billion make it the eighteenth
largest company in the United States. Enron invests in energy
projects in countries around the world, including Argentina,
Bolivia, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mozambique, and the
Philippines.

  The company has recently expanded onto the Internet, buying and
selling a dizzying array of products ranging from pulp and paper to
petrochemicals and plastics, as well as esoteric products like clean
air credits that utilities purchase to meet emission limits.

  Texas activists say that the tight connection between Bush and Lay
bodes ill if Bush is elected. Andrew Wheat, from Texans for Public
Justice, a campaign finance advocacy group in Austin, compares the
symbiotic relationship between Enron and the governor to
"cogeneration"-a process used by utilities to harness waste heat
vented by their generators to produce more power. "In a more
sinister form of cogeneration, corporations are converting economic
into political power," he says. "A Bush election fueled by Enron
dollars could ignite in the public policy arena, and consumers would
get burned."

  And so may people in the Third World.

  Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have both criticized
Enron for colluding with police who brutally suppressed protests at
the company's giant power plant in western India. The plant's
operating firm is called the Dabhol Power Company. From 1992 to
1998, Enron owned 80 percent of it, with General Electric and
Bechtel each holding a 10 percent share. (In 1998, the Indian state
electricity board bought a 30 percent share of the company, which
reduced Enron's stake to 50 percent.)

  For years, the plant has been the site of many nonviolent protests.

  "The project has met with opposition from local people and
activists from elsewhere in India on the grounds of its social,
economic, and environmental impact," Amnesty wrote in a July 1997
report. "Protesters and activists have been subjected to harassment,
arbitrary arrest, preventive detention under the ordinary criminal
law, and ill treatment. Amnesty International considers those who
have been subjected to arrest and temporary periods of imprisonment
as a result of undertaking peaceful protest to be prisoners of
conscience, imprisoned solely for exercising their right to freedom
of expression."

  Amnesty's report found that "women, who have been at the forefront
of local agitation, appear to have been a particular target."

  Just before dawn on June 3, 1997, police stormed the homes of
several women. "The policemen forcibly opened the door and dragged
me out of the house into the police van parked on the road. (While
dragging me) the police kept beating me on my back with batons. The
humiliation meted out to the other members of my family was similar
to the way I was humiliated. . . . My one-and-a-half year-old
daughter held on to me but the police kicked her away," says
Sugandha Vasudev Bhalekar-a twenty-four-year-old housewife who was
three months pregnant at the time of her arrest, according to
Amnesty's report. Amnesty found that another pregnant woman was
beaten and several other women sustained injuries, including
bruising, abrasions, and lacerations on arms and legs.

  Amnesty said the police involved in suppressing protests included
"the Special Reserve Police [SRP] on the site of the company." It
added: "The involvement of the SRP in the harassment of protesters
indicates the need for the three U.S. multinationals participating
in the joint venture to take steps to ensure that all the management
and staff of the DPC [Dabhol Power Company)-in particular, any
security staff subcontracted to, seconded to, or employed by the
company-are trained in human rights and are fully accountable for
their actions.

  A January 1999 investigation by Human Rights Watch came to a
stronger conclusion. "Human Rights Watch believes that the Dabhol
Power Corporation and its parent company Enron are complicit in
these human rights violations," it said. "The company, under
provisions of law, paid the abusive state forces for the security
they provided to the company. These forces, located adjacent to the
project site, were only stationed there to deal with protests. In
addition, contractors (for DPC) engaged in a pattern of harassment,
intimidation, and attacks on individuals opposed to the Dabhol Power
project. . . . The Dabhol Power Corporation refused to acknowledge
that its contractors were responsible for criminal acts and did not
adequately investigate, condemn, or cease relationships with these
individuals."

  Enron denies any wrongdoing. "While we respect the mission of Human
Rights Watch, we do not feel that its report on the Dabhol Power
project is accurate," says an Enron spokesperson. "The report refers
to peaceful protests, when, in fact, the reason the police were
positioned near our site is that there have been many acts of
violence against our employees and contractors. Dabhol Power Company
has worked hard to promote positive relations with the community.
Unfortunately, the good relationship we have built with a large
percentage of the community was not reflected in the report. Enron
is committed to providing energy and communications services while
preserving the human rights of citizens and our workers."

  Enron has also raised a stink in Bolivia with its involvement in
the Cuiaba Integrated Energy Project. The project is run by
Transredes, Bolivia's hydrocarbon transport company, which came into
being in 1997 after Bolivia privatized its oil sector under the
influence of the World Bank. A joint venture of Enron and Shell owns
50 percent of Transredes. On January 31, 2000, a Transredes oil
pipeline erupted and dumped an estimated 10,000 barrels of refined
crude oil and gasoline into the Desaguadero River, which supports
indigenous communities such as the Uru Muratos.

  "This problem is Transredes's number one priority, and we are
committed to continue to work hard to mitigate the short- and
long-term social and environmental impact," wrote Steve Hopper,
president of Transredes, in a letter addressed "To the People of
Bolivia" on February 7.

  Facing starvation from the Loss of their life-sustaining waterfowl
and fish, the Uru Muratos left their ancestral lands at the southern
shores of Lake Poopo in April and marched eighty-five miles to the
city of Oruro to ask for government help.

  "We subsequently reached an agreement with them to provide certain
levels of relief and assistance," says Keith Miceli, general manager
for public relations for Enron, South America.

  In its actions overseas, Enron has made a practice of taking
advantage of corporate welfare. And it has enlisted George W Bush in
this effort.

  For example, in March 1997, Lay wrote a letter to Bush that was
subsequently released to the press under Texas open records laws,
asking him to contact every member of the Texas delegation in
Congress to explain how "export credit agencies of the United States
are critical to U.S. developers like Enron, who are pursuing
international projects in developing countries." These agencies
include the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), which
provides political risk coverage and financial support to U.S.
companies investing abroad.

  "OPIC provided financing or insurance coverage worth almost $300
million for Enron's foreign projects just last year, according to
government records," The New York Times reported. "Enron officials
have in the past asked Mr. Bush to help lobby lawmakers to
appropriate funds of OPIC, as well as for the Export-Import Bank,
another federal agency that aids American companies abroad."

  Enron received $200 million in political risk insurance for the
Dabhol project in 1996. And it received $200 million in insurance
from OPIC in 1999 for its Bolivian project.

  The Enron Methanol plant in Pasadena, Texas, lies in the Houston
Ship Channel area, the nation's largest concentration of
petrochemical plants just east of the city. The plant has won
special concessions from Governor Bush, allowing the company to
pollute without a permit, as well as giving it immunity from
prosecution for violating some environmental standards.

  Plants like this in Texas cumulatively emit twice as much nitrogen
oxide, a key ingredient of smog, as do all the nine million cars in
Texas put together.

  Only 7 percent of the more than 3,500 tons of nitrogen oxide
emitted by the Enron Methanol plant in 1997 would have been
permitted had Enron not gotten away with this under the "grandfather
clause" of the 1971 Texas Clean Air Act, which allows plants built
before 1971 to continue their polluting practices. Bush extended
this clause under the 1999 Clean Air Responsibility Enterprise
(CARE) program that his office drew up in a series of secret
meetings with representatives of the top polluters in the state, as
Molly Ivins reported. CARE waives permit requirements for plants
that volunteer to cut emissions.

  The CARE program is backed up by an act that Bush signed in May
1995 giving sweeping protections to polluters that perform internal
environmental or safety audits. The law makes these audit documents
confidential and allows polluters to escape responsibility for
environmental violations. To date, Enron has conducted five such
audits and filed for immunity from prosecution for violations of the
law, according to the Texas Natural Resources Conservation
Commission (TNRCC), the state equivalent of the Environmental
Protection Agency.

  Tamara Maschini, who lives about five miles from the Enron plant,
is one of the founders of a local environmental group called Clean
Air Clear Lake.

  "Whole families in this neighborhood have asthma because of the
pollution from plants like Enron," she says.

  Mark Palmer, head of public relations for Enron, says that the
company's contribution to local pollution is minimal.

  "If the grandfather clause was canceled right now, we would benefit
the most of any of the companies in Texas because our nitrogen oxide
emissions add up to less than half a percent of the total," he says.

  Last year, the Bush campaign borrowed Enron's corporate jets eight
times to fly aides around the country, more times than any of the
thirty-four other companies that made their company aircraft
available to the Presidential hopeful.

  And Lay often acts as George W. Bush's chaperone.

  On April 7, 2000, he played host to Bush and his father, the former
President, at the Houston Astros' first home game of the season. The
game was held in the baseball team's brand new stadium-Enron
Field-which was built with the help of a $100 million donation from
Enron. (The company got free advertising, a tax break, and a $200
million contract to supply power to the stadium in return.)

  Less than three weeks later, Lay joined candidate Bush in
Washington, D.C., for a Republican fundraiser that topped all
previous records by bringing in a staggering $21.3 million, easily
the biggest one-night haul for any political party in history.

  "Ken Lay is a noted business leader in Texas who has long been
active in Republican politics," says Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for
the Bush campaign. "He is chair of the Governor's Business Council.
But the governor has his own agenda based on what he believes is
best for Texas and for the country."

  For his part, Lay tries to put his contributions in a favorable
light. "When I make contributions to a candidate, it is not for some
special favor, it's not even for access-although I'll be the first
to admit it probably helps access," he told The New York Times. "It
is because I'm supporting candidates I strongly believe in
personally."

  In January 1999, Enron pitched in $50,000 to help pay for Bush's
inaugural bash in Austin, Texas, after he won reelection for
governor. Today, the polls show that George W Bush has a better than
even chance of winning the Presidential election. If he does, it is
very likely Ken Lay will be pitching in for another inaugural bash.

Mark 

Thanks for the call a couple of weeks ago regarding our new ad campaign.  The 
challenge as I understand it is that we have difficulty in quantifying the 
benefit and effectiveness of our ads.   We can measure on a periodic basis 
what the CEO/CCO/CFO perception of Enron is on a periodic basis but this does 
not break down the impact of our PR efforts from an ad campaign.   I 
understand this dilemma.

But one thing that we could measure that is quite important to me is what our 
employees think about these ads.    If all else fails these ads should make 
our employees proud to work for Enron - and this is something we should be 
able to measure on a consistent basis.

I know you have an upcoming event in California where your organisation will 
talk about problems and challenges we have - so if you could consider this 
idea I would be very appreciative.  And of course don't get to hooked on 
God's country while you are in Napa.

Thanks!

		 Subject: Update --Third Session -- Day 4 -- PRINCIPALS MEET SATURDAY

Friday, January 12, 2001

By the end of the day, the Treasury had decided to move forward and hold 
another meeting with the CEOs, Governor Davis and various other Government 
officials.  Governor Davis refused to come to California, so a video 
conference was set up with two locations:  one at DOE in Washington and one 
in Los Angeles for the Governor and his entourage.  It was tentatively set up 
for 2:30 pm CST.  I have had no reports on the meeting yet. Ken Lay, Steve 
Kean and Rick Shapiro attended for Enron.

Long-Term Forward Contracts

Good progress was made and the report was completed by 4 pm.  It includes a 
draft RFO, draft standard contract, a table of utilties' needs, products 
required and a timetable that would have power flowing by February 1.
Participants were fairly pessimistic about the eventual outcome, however, 
given the absence of any buy-in or participation by the State of California.


Debt and Forebearance

Group also worked to have draft documents completed by COB Friday.


QF Contract Reformation

Parties continued discussion
No information was available by COB Friday.

Major Issues

State interest in resolving
State willingness to raise retail rates
Utilties' desire to offload all risk to the State as its portfolio manager
Willingness to "call off the dogs" for the suppliers and to release them from 
legal action
State willingness to offer up sites for power plant development
Ability to reach deal on QF contract reformation


Next Steps

If definitive agreement is not reached by the principals at Saturday meeting, 
this work ends immediately and utilities will likely file for bankruptcy the 
week of Jan 15.

If agreement is reached, a massive amount of work is required immediately, 
such as:
FERC filing of settlement and ISO Tariff change by Tuesday Jan 16.
RFO completion and release by Jan 18
Introduction and passage of necessary legislation to be executed by February 
2.
Preparation of contract between utilities and state (probably DWR)
Preparation of formal agreements among the parties on the terms on this 
settlement

And more...

Rob,
After reviewing both Lauren's and Jeff's comments, I have little to add.  I 
would, however, replace the last part of Jeff's sentence in the first 
paragraph with "and there is a need to take a comprehensive look at 
strategies for reducing CO2  emissions more broadly, in ways that make 
economic and environmental sense" to avoid mentioning the Kyoto Protocol 
directly.
And, I'd like to reiterate Lauren's suggestion that the article should direct 
employees to our climate change policy statement in last year's EHS Report 
and that Lay encourages them to research and reflect on the issue and 
communicate their thoughts.
Thanks,
Catherine

		 Subject: Ken Lay Statement to Employees on Bush CO2 Policy


(KEELER EDITS)
Here is my draft for Ken in response to Ann's eBiz request.  Comments welcome


"The President, after a good deal of study and soul searching, decided not to 
support mandatory controls on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from power 
plants as part of a multipollutant clean air strategy.   His decision was 
based on some very important factors -- the nation's energy markets are 
experiencing unprecedented supply and price challenges that any CO2 mandate 
could exacerbate; and U.S. regulation of CO2 in the near-term could be 
ill-advised because the Kyoto protocol on global treatment of greenhouse gas 
emissions is unworkable in its current form.  

"I was somewhat concerned that the message sent by the Bush administration 
would polarize the debate over how the U.S. should treat CO2 emissions in the 
long term, as his statement did provoke a very negative "anti-environment" 
reaction by many concerned individuals and organizations.  Because this is an 
important issue to all parties on all sides of the debate, I believe that the 
administration should convene an ongoing process to carefully examine global 
climate change and all the long-term economic, scientific, and social impacts 
of action regulate CO2 emissions."

"The President's position on CO2 notwithstanding, Enron continue to be a 
private sector leader in offering real solutions towards reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions in a rapidly expanding energy market.  We are well-positioned 
through our experience with low-carbon fuels for electric generation (natural 
gas and wind in particular), our focus on new power generation and 
tecnologies, our leadership position in promoting efficiency through Enron 
Energy Services' energy outsourcing business, and our expertise in emissions 
trading and risk management."

"A multipollutant appraoch to reducing power plant emissions makes a lot of 
sense from and environmental and energy policy standpoint.  Enron will 
continue to work with the Bush administration and Congress toward structuring 
a program that can achieve environmental goals while providing incentives to 
build cleaner, more efficient generation, promoting a broad mix of fuels and 
tecnologies, and giving industry the flexibility and economic incentives to 
make reductions in a market-based, cost-effective way.  If we're able to make 
meaningful reductions in 3 pollutants -- NOx, SO2 and mercury -- and we do it 
in a way that promotes efficiency and new technology, we'll make progress on 
CO2 whether it is regulated or not."

In the meantime, I will remain active in the global climate change debate to 
position Enron as a constructive player in the public policy arena and as an 
industry leader in promoting market-driven solutions to the world's energy 
and environmental problems.

Hi Mr. Lay,

I am a Specialist in Corp. PR, under Karen Denne, and write for our internal 
eBiz publication.  I am working on a story about the recent issue with 
respect to carbon dioxide emissions and Enron's position compared to 
President Bush's as well as the coal industry.  

I know that Bush's viewpoint on this issue is not to regulate carbon dioxide 
emissions from coal-burning power plants. I also understand he based his 
decision in large part due to a recent Department of Energy report that warns 
that such a policy would lead to an even more dramatic shift from coal to 
natural gas for electric power generation and significantly higher 
electricity prices causing problems similar to California.   

I wondered if you would mind adding first hand knowledge for employees.  A 
quote from you about this issue would be great.  I would also be interested 
in giving employees some of your reasons for being in favor of controlling 
CO2 such as your idea for a credit trading system for CO2.

Thank you for your time and please let me know if you have any questions.  

Thanks,
 Ann Schmidt

Notes from Bryson conversation with Ken Lay:

Urged us to "stay at the table".

Says teams in Washington have all the demand curves from the utilities (from 
which to calculate offering prices).

QF meeting starts at 7:00 pm tonight.
says average cost of QFs today is 15?/kwh (amounts to 30% of supply).
believes that cost can be brought down significantly if gas is purchased 
forward (perhaps by state entity).

Says all utility generation (another 30%), mostly hydro and nuclear is cost 
based at  4?/kwh.

If suppliers come in at 5.5? (or even 6?), there is room under the 7? new 
commodity rate component to recover securitized costs (amounts to about 40% 
of SCE supply).

Says good progress was made today.  Believes they may have a framework this 
evening.

Believes 5.5? is causing problem; maybe room to squeeze it up (perhaps as 
high as 6.0?).

Thinks governor will slightly increase rates (or pay more at government 
facilities) if the parties can get 97% of the way to a solution.

Thinks it's nearly a "done deal" that DWR (state entity) will buy power.

Says securitization may be harder to get.

Bryson's questions to Ken (and Ken's to us):  Are we willing to forbear 
payment of amounts owed to us and continue to sell power to the utilities 
over the next several weeks.  Ken realizes that Bryson may be overstating the 
progress made, and made no commitments to Bryson.

Let's discuss at 10:30 call tomorrow.

I'll do it.  I saw Steve Reynolds (the govs assistant), today, and told him I 
would do it.  I have a lot of respect for Geringer.  I may try to persuade 
them that they should reach out to FERC and Congress as a state that sees the 
need for a federal role in transmiission and encourages FERC to act.  Any 
background you have would be most appreciated.

Subject: Gov Geringer meeting

Steve/RIck ---as you may be aware, Governor Geringer personally asked Ken Lay 
to come to the kick off meeting of the Wyoming Energy Task Force, a group 
that was created by legislative mandate last month.  The meeting is on May 
30th in Cheyenne.  Mr. Lay told the Governor that he would not be able to 
make it on that date, but promised that a senior Enron exectutive would be 
there.  I spoke with Governor Geringer's staff person again this past week 
and was hoping that Paul Kaufman could be the senior executive, but no such 
luck (unless you give Paul a huge new title!).  

In talking with Maureen I understand that you have a previous conflict Steve, 
but I am hoping that you can review your calendar to see if you could make an 
adjustment in order to meet the request of the Governor.  Your speech would 
be in the morning--I've been told about 9 o clock or so---which would allow 
for you to leave by noonish.

Governor Renews Criticism of Regulators 

Power: The governor implies that the panel is too ideological. Its approval 
is needed if California is to purchase the electricity transmission grid. 

By DAN MORAIN and NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writers 

?????WASHINGTON--Gov. Gray Davis, trying to win support for California's plan 
to buy a huge stretch of the state's electrical transmission system, took a 
swipe Tuesday at the federal commission that must bless such a deal.
?????Davis noted that President Bush has an opportunity to fill two vacancies 
on the five-member Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and will determine 
its chairman.
?????"It is my hope," Davis said, "that whoever the president chooses is a 
practical businessman or woman who lives in the real world and understands 
that when you inherit a mess, your job is to fix it, right the ship and move 
forward--as opposed to being a rigid adherent to ideology."
?????Earlier this year, Bush appointed Curt Hebert Jr., a strong free-market 
proponent who has served on the commission since 1999, as chairman. But he 
can change that appointment.
?????Hebert, a 38-year-old attorney and former Mississippi lawmaker, has said 
Davis' plan to have California buy 32,000 miles of high-tension power lines 
from the state's ailing utilities would amount to "nationalization" and might 
not be in the public interest.
?????The commission has been a strong advocate of electricity deregulation 
and, in addition to the dispute over purchase of the power grid, Davis has 
criticized its members for refusing to impose limits on soaring wholesale 
power prices, which bled California utilities of billions of dollars in the 
last nine months.
?????"We have practical problems we have to solve," he said, citing the 
billions of dollars the utilities owe power generators and banks. "My hope is 
that [Bush] places people on the FERC who understand real-world 
considerations."
?????Hebert could not be reached for comment Tuesday. The commission's two 
other members, William L. Massey and Linda K. Breathitt, Democrats appointed 
by former President Bill Clinton, were also unavailable. There are two 
vacancies on the panel.
?????Davis spoke after conferring for 30 minutes with U.S. Energy Secretary 
Spencer Abraham about the state's proposal to help the financially ailing 
utilities by purchasing the power grid. He presented Abraham with a nine-page 
memo detailing the plan and said the energy secretary would probably give him 
his views on the plan by the end of the week.
?????Last week, the governor struck a tentative deal with Southern California 
Edison to buy its portion of the grid for $2.76 billion, more than twice the 
book value. He is working on similar deals with Pacific Gas & Electric and 
San Diego Gas & Electric. Utilities could use money from the sale to 
restructure their multibillion-dollar debt.
?????Although Abraham has no direct authority over the energy commission, he 
presumably holds influence with Bush, and Davis came away from their 
conversation buoyed.
?????"If he would endorse the plan," Davis said, "that would be a leg up in 
getting FERC's approval. . . . I hope by the end of the week he will be able 
to endorse the proposal or at least endorse a modified proposal that is 
satisfactory to us.
?????"Believe me," Davis said, "I've been in enough meetings to know when 
someone is trying to be helpful and when someone is not. [Abraham] is trying 
to be helpful. He wants this problem solved, and . . . I believe he will 
support our proposal to get Southern California Edison back into the energy 
business."
?????Under federal law, the energy commission would have to approve 
California's purchase of the steel towers and aluminum wires of its three 
biggest private utilities. The commission could scuttle the purchase if it 
determined that state ownership would harm the public interest--a legal 
standard that gives the agency much discretion.
?????Walter Ferguson, Hebert's chief of staff, said Tuesday that Davis' plan 
would get close scrutiny.
?????"Sure, we have to be open-minded, but I'm skeptical as to how this 
helps," he said. "How does this solve the supply issue? How does this impact 
the region? Those two questions have got to be answered, because you don't 
want to make the problem worse."
?????California's proposal runs counter to the commission's 2-year-old push 
to have transmission grids operate on a wide regional scale without heed to 
political boundaries. In some parts of the Midwest and South, private 
companies have proposed operating transmission systems for profit--a trend 
endorsed by Hebert.
?????"I assume Hebert is going to be unenthusiastic, probably very 
unenthusiastic [about California's proposal]," said Richard Pierce, a George 
Washington University law professor who has observed the commission for 
decades.
?????"Nobody at FERC is going to be real happy about a state trying to take 
away from FERC jurisdiction over a large portion of a transmission grid," he 
said. "I can't imagine any commissioner will like that. So what we're talking 
about is the intensity of their dislike and whether it will be so great 
they'll say, 'No, we won't approve it.' "
?????Consumer advocates and state Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) 
have endorsed state purchase of the transmission grid as a way to get 
California out from under some federal oversight. Ownership would, for 
example, allow the state to set the transmission fees that electricity 
consumers pay. Those fees now amount to about 6% of the average utility 
customer's monthly bill and are overseen by the energy commission.
?????Burton has also argued that state ownership would give California 
greater control over its own destiny should federal officials try to force 
the West to manage its interconnected grid under a single agency.
?????Federal rules already prohibit transmission grid owners from 
discriminating, through fees or rules, against the generators and marketers 
that use their lines like highways to move electricity from power plants to 
buyers.
?????Davis, in trying to win support for state purchase of the grid, has not 
focused on the freedom from federal regulators California might gain. 
Instead, he has treated the idea as a key part of a financial transaction 
necessary to revitalize debt-ridden utilities.
?????Davis said he expects that California would operate the transmission 
system within federal restrictions.
?????"I am not looking forward to any additional regulatory burdens from 
FERC," Davis said. "Obviously, we will meet the existing regulatory burden 
that we have."
?????Whether the commission will approve a state purchase of the grid and how 
long it will take to reach a decision are unknown, Edison International Chief 
Financial Officer Ted Craver told debt holders Tuesday in a conference call. 
He characterized Hebert's recent public statements on the matter as "cryptic."
?????A decision by FERC on sale of the grid could take "many months," 
according to research released Tuesday by Fitch Inc., a credit-rating firm.
?????Fitch called the tentative agreement between Edison and the state "a 
favorable step to avoid bankruptcy," but noted that several hurdles remain, 
chiefly approval by the state Legislature and the federal commission.
?????State Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) said that if the commission rejects 
California's purchase of transmission lines, the state should simply condemn 
the property.
?????"It was President Bush who told Gov. Davis that California should solve 
this," said Peace. "Gov. Davis is doing so. Certainly President Bush would 
expect the governor to use every tool at his disposal to solve it."

Energy Crisis Fails to Hamper Selling of California Bonds 

By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, Times Staff Writer 

?????The energy crisis is apparently not affecting California's ability to 
finance its debt.
?????California successfully sold $982 million in bonds Tuesday to provide 
funds for a variety of construction projects and already approved ballot 
measures, including last year's $2.1-billion parks bond.
?????Most of the sale, $600 million, represents new funding, while the 
remainder will be used to refinance older bonds at current, more favorable 
interest rates.
?????The general obligation bonds, overseen by state Treasurer Phil 
Angelides, will have a 4.8% rate of interest--which is actually lower than 
the last few general obligation bonds issued before the energy crisis.
?????A day before the sale, Wall Street credit-rating firm Fitch IBCA blessed 
the bond issue with a favorable AA credit rating, and reaffirmed its AA 
rating for the state's $22.6 billion in outstanding bond debt. The two other 
major rating agencies, Standard & Poor's and Moody's, rated the bonds Aa2 and 
AA, respectively.
?????In releasing its rating, Fitch analysts concluded that, although the 
energy crisis is taking a substantial toll on California's budget reserves, 
that money will eventually be repaid through a $10-billion bond issue that 
will be paid off by utility ratepayers.
?????Moreover, Fitch concluded, the state's per-capita debt of $787 is 
moderate compared with that of other states--and the California economy has 
yet to show any signs of being significantly affected by the crisis.
?????"In anything that's tangible--tax receipts, employment information--we 
have yet to see a real effect," said Fitch vice chair Claire G. Cohen.

BUSINESS 
Energy Crisis Is a Benefit to Redding
George Raine
? 
02/28/2001 
The San Francisco Chronicle 
FINAL 
Page C1 
(Copyright 2001) 
High energy prices can create strange bedfellows. 
Just ask Morpheus Lights Inc., a powerhouse in the entertainment industry 
that has provided the lighting for the Academy Awards as well as the concerts 
of Bruce Springsteen, Shania Twain, Metallica, and Ringo Starr and his All 
Star Band. 
A fixture in Santa Clara County, the company shifted its operations three 
years ago 225 miles north of San Francisco to Redding, a city resting 
comfortably between the Cascades and the Trinity Alps that is known more for 
its Pendleton shirts and wily trout. 
The move has paid off handsomely. This city of about 78,000 has escaped the 
energy deregulation crisis that is roiling California and is, in fact, a 
seller of surplus power. 
That's good news to Morpheus, which consumes some 25,000 kilowatts a month to 
test and manufacture huge performance lighting pieces like its BriteBurst, 
which has enough power to light 3Com Park and was used in the 2000 Super Bowl 
halftime festivities. 
Morpheus is one of several success stories touted by the Economic Development 
Corporation of Shasta County, which is attempting to sell businesses on an 
outdoorsy quality of life in Redding, through which the Sacramento River 
meanders and where labor is plentiful and costs are low. 
But there's much more, the pitch goes: Redding is a unique electrical island 
unto itself, with its own electric utility and ample surplus power to sell -- 
this while investor-owned utilities mull bankruptcy and the lights and the 
patience of business owners flicker in much of the rest of California . 
Other states and regions of the country have initiated economic development 
campaigns to capitalize on California 's misfortune, seeking to lure 
businesses disgruntled by the energy crisis. 
But as much or more aggressive efforts are now being developed within 
California to convince businesses they don't need to leave because there are 
sanctuaries of electrical stability. 
NONPROFIT LOCAL UTILITY 
Redding has owned and operated its nonprofit electric utility since 1921. The 
utility purchases significant amounts of its energy from the federally 
operated Central Valley Project, through the Bonneville Power Administration 
in the Northwest, and it generates energy at its own gas-fired power plant. 
In fact, Redding Electric Utility (REU) has made so much money selling 
surplus power that it expects to pay off its debt a year from now, two years 
earlier than originally expected. 
"We are a utility that has resources in excess of our needs and that's a nice 
place to be," said Jim Feider, director of the REU. 
Several months before most Californians knew a long-term energy crisis 
loomed, the Economic Development Corporation of Shasta County, which seeks to 
attract business and the wealth it generates, began to aggressively pursue 
small and midsize Bay Area manufacturing businesses looking to expand and 
relocate. 
There is a lot of ground to make up in Shasta County, said Jim Zauher, the 
EDC president. In 1970, 19 percent of the county's workforce was in 
manufacturing and most of that was in the timber industry, which then 
tumbled. 
Since then, 4,000 jobs have been lost, and manufacturing is at 7 percent. 
That figure has been stabilized, with 1,270 new jobs in the past four years. 
The EDC has set a goal for the next five years of 1,500 jobs at $15 per hour. 
In the Shasta County-area workforce of 84,000 (71,600 in Shasta and another 
12,400 in Tehama County), a consultant's survey has identified 18,000 
underemployed workers who have the skills, education and experience that 
qualify them for a better job, said Zauher. 
Two weeks ago, the Shasta County EDC retained a Silicon Valley insider, Bill 
Haerle, former vice president for government relations and national accounts 
at the American Electronics Association, and former MCI executive, as a 
consultant. The EDC wants Haerle to create access to "low-tech" or "mid-tech" 
manufacturers. 
"First, a company has to decide the threshold question, whether it can 
operate in the greater Redding area. Then they look at the cost of doing 
business and a large component of that is a reliable source of reasonable 
energy. The third is the labor pool," said Haerle. 
STAYING IN STATE 
"Shasta County offers a solution without leaving the state. But this is a 
highly sensitive issue and we don't want to appear to be poaching," he said. 
"We are looking for smaller companies that could flourish in the greater 
Redding area." 
Haerle has yet to reel in a company, but the path has been cleared by 
Morpheus Lights, which moved up nearly three years ago, and a handful of 
other small and midsize businesses in the past year. 
In addition to energy savings, Morpheus has seen other dividends. The 
lighting company, which was paying $1.55 a square foot for space in Santa 
Clara, pays approximately 25 cents per square foot in Redding. This enabled 
the company to move from a 30,000-square-foot space in Santa Clara to one 
with 42,000 square feet in Redding. 
The extra space enables concert tour stage and lighting designers to conduct 
rehearsals with the computerized systems at the Redding site, said Dan 
English, Morpheus' vice president of operations. 
"We can be anywhere, as long as it's close to a major freeway, because the 
equipment travels by truck. There's I-5," said English. 
Nearby, Knauf Fiber Glass of Shelbyville, Ind., a leading U.S. manufacturer 
of thermal and acoustical fiber-glass insulations, is building a $140 million 
plant in Shasta Lake City. Some 2,000 people have applied for the plant's 150 
jobs. 
Shasta Lake City, too, has its own utility but does not generate power. It 
buys power from the federal government and also contracts with Enron for 
supplemental needs, and is negotiating for more to ensure a 24-hour operation 
for Knauf. 
Redding's energy situation is enviable. The REU reaches its demand peak at 
215 megawatts in the summer, when its has access to between 285 and 300 
megawatts, said director Feider. The excess is sold. 
SELF-SUFFICIENCY GOAL 
In the early 1990s, REU made a strategic decision to make costly capital 
expenditures so that it could be more self-sufficent instead of being subject 
to market conditions, said Feider. 
When the electricity deregulation bill was signed in 1996, REU worried that 
with its debt of $300 million from those improvements it would be at risk in 
a competitive environment. As a result, it decided in 1997 to eliminate it 
with a controversial 23 percent surcharge on customer bills. 
The rates went from 8 cents a kilowatt hour to 10 cents, and the plan in 1997 
was for the surcharge to continue through 2004. But Redding has prospered in 
the surplus power market and now expects to eliminate the surcharge in early 
2002. 
Now, if everything goes according to form, the district could see a return to 
a rate of 8 cents, said Feider. 
Kevin Risse moved his Risse Racing, a high-end bicycle component 
manufacturer, from Sunnyvale in June 2000. "We came up and heard the spiel 
and power was one thing and, in hindsight, it turned out to be pretty 
important," said Risse. 
In Sunnyvale, his PG&E bill was $2,000 a month. In Redding, he pays from $800 
to $1,000 monthly. Risse moved from a 4,000-square- foot space to an 
8,000-square-foot building and cut his rent by more than half. It fell from 
$1 per square foot to 35 cents, said Risse, whose company builds bicycle 
shock absorbers and forks. 
"There are things we miss about the Bay Area, culturally, but, at the same 
time, I lived in Redwood City and sometimes it was a 20- minute commute and 
sometimes one hour and 20 minutes," he said. 
"There are people who worked for me with rents going up and they are caught 
in a loop and there's nothing they can do. But now they're paying $400 a 
month in Redding rather than $1,000 in the Bay Area." 
Chris King Precision Components, also a maker of sophisticated bicycle 
components, was synonymous with Santa Barbara for 25 years, but the tight 
labor market and cost of living for blue-color workers no longer made 
economic sense, said King, who now employes 60 people in Redding. 
King said that in 1996, he placed an ad for an assembly worker and got 50 
applications. In 1999, he placed the same ad and got one application. "The 
labor market was strangling us," he said. 
In Redding, he received 2,000 applications for jobs at his plant, where he 
will employ about 100 this summer. "But there is a lot of chaff in this 
area," he said of the labor pool. "It's a low-cost area that has 
traditionally gone boom and bust, mostly bust," said King. 
King said he is confident he can maintain a blue-collar workforce adequate to 
the test of manufacturing what he described as the "Rolls Royce" standard in 
the bicycle industry. However, he said he has concerns about his ability to 
attract higher-paid designers with degrees in mechanical engineering. 
"You can go skiing in 45 minutes, and the environmental part of the equation 
is pretty incredible," King said of the Shasta County area. "But there's no 
foreign film theater here, no culture. There's middle-class shopping, and you 
need to entertain executive people or engineers or creative people. Unless 
they like fishing."

Davis: Power-crisis fixes almost finished 
By David Whitney
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published Feb. 28, 2001) 
WASHINGTON -- California Gov. Gray Davis said Tuesday the state is two weeks 
to a month away from completing all the "legislative fixes" to its 
electricity crisis, and that with "a little luck and a lot of conservation" 
he hopes to avoid power blackouts this summer when demand is at its peak. 
"I see light at the end of the tunnel and it's not a train," Davis said 
during a luncheon speech before the California State Society. "It is the 
lights staying on in the state." But the governor, who spent much of his time 
here at the National Governors Association's winter meeting fending off 
questions about the state's power situation, left for New York City on 
Tuesday afternoon without any firm endorsements from the Bush administration. 
And despite his rosy recap of his administration's progress, he acknowledged 
that difficult work remains before deals can be reached to revive 
cash-starved utilities teetering on bankruptcy, particularly Pacific Gas and 
Electric Co. 
Davis said that he thought he might have an agreement soon -- perhaps by the 
end of the week -- with Southern California Edison permitting it to sell 
revenue bonds to repay debts to power wholesalers in exchange for state 
acquisition of their electric transmission lines. 
"PG&E is taking a little longer," the governor said. "Its debt is two times 
as big. It's a little more complicated situation -- two, three four weeks at 
the outside and we'll have PG&E worked out." 
PG&E declined to comment on the governor's timetable, but spokesman John 
Nelson confirmed that company officials will take part in talks with the 
Governor's Office this week. 
Deals to take over the utilities' power lines would put the state in the 
electricity transmission business, even though it's intention is to lease the 
day-to-day operations back to the utilities. But Davis said the deals would 
complete "all the legislative fixes" and put the state on course toward 
stabilizing supplies and price. 
"Does this mean we are home free and don't have to worry about anything?" the 
governor said. "No, but it means we are basically on the downside of the 
problem." 
Striking deals with the utilities is not the only remaining problem, however. 
State purchase of the transmission lines would require approval by the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
Davis was scouting for help Tuesday from Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham on 
that front. 
In a brief meeting with reporters, Davis described Abraham as "open" to the 
transmission line purchase. Davis said he presented the secretary with a 
nine-page memo on the Southern California Edison transaction, and Abraham 
said he'd review it and get back to the governor by the end of the week. 
"If he would endorse the plan, that would be a big leg up in terms of getting 
the FERC's approval," Davis said, even though Abraham cannot simply order the 
FERC to approve the deal. "I hope by the end of the week he'll be able to 
endorse the proposal or at least endorse a modified proposal that is 
satisfactory to us." 
In his speech to the California State Society, an organization of 
Californians who live and work in the Washington area, Davis said the state 
is on course to add new generating plants over three years so that supply 
exceeds demand. 
But to make it through the summer, Californians are going to have to work 
hard to reduce consumption, he said. Residences are being asked to curb usage 
by 10 percent, and mechanisms are in place to squeeze similar savings from 
industries and commercial buildings through mandatory curtailments and cash 
incentives. 
"We are practicing what we preach," Davis said. 
He said his wife has turned down the thermostat in their home to 55 degrees. 
"I go to bed with a heavy sweat shirt on, sweat pants, three blankets and a 
comforter," Davis said. "Going to the kitchen is like going to Antarctica. My 
office is so dark at night you could develop film in it." 
Davis meets today with analysts on Wall Street, where he will carry forward 
the same message he delivered Tuesday -- that California is on the road to 
energy self-sufficiency. 
"We'll have utilities back in business paying their bills," he said. "We'll 
have long-term contracts for power at greatly reduced prices. We'll have a 
very aggressive conservation program. And we'll have a public power authority 
not unlike New York, the state of Washington and Tennessee."

Davis passed up Duke Energy's deals
The supplier's offers last summer could have helped avoid blackouts this year 
By Mike Taugher
TIMES STAFF WRITER 
As the California energy crisis was beginning to brew last summer, one of the 
state's largest electricity suppliers made Gov. Gray Davis a pair of offers 
to smooth the state's energy convulsions. 
Looking back, the governor may be regretting that he dismissed the proposals. 
Duke Energy said it could sell enough electricity for 2 million homes for 
five years at what is now considered a very low price of $50 per 
megawatt-hour. 
And Duke said that if the governor helped speed up permits, the company could 
build enough new portable units to power an additional 500,000 homes. 
Those offers embodied what has become two of the governor's top strategies in 
dealing with the crisis -- stabilizing the price of electricity through 
relatively long-term commitments and boosting generation to avoid blackouts 
this summer. 
As it was, though, Duke spokesman Tom Williams said his company never 
received a response to its July 31 proposal. 
In hindsight, Davis' inaction could prove costly. The governor's campaign to 
enter into long-term deals for electricity has produced just a handful of 
modest contracts, and there is some doubt that the governor's goal to speed 
up construction of small portable power plants to power millions of homes 
will be reached by summer. 
"We're pleased he's got that sense of urgency," Williams said. "We displayed 
that sense of urgency on July 31." 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said at the time the offer was made, Duke's 
proposal was expensive and there was uncertainty about how the energy crisis 
would take shape. In hindsight, the Duke proposal "seems like the deal of the 
century today," Maviglio said. "The question is, where's that offer today? 
... They're not at the table now with a reasonable offer." 
Had the governor decided to help Duke get permits for the new "peaker 
plants," he could already be halfway to his goal of getting 1,000 megawatts 
worth of new peaker plants by this summer. 
Now, however, Duke says its offers are off the table. The units the company 
would have used in California are now committed to the Midwest, and Duke has 
become hesitant to invest more money in a state where it has more than $400 
million in uncollected power bills from the state's utilities, according to 
Williams. 
Moreover, Williams and others said it would be difficult for energy companies 
to meet Davis' goal of 1,000 megawatts from new peaker power plants by summer 
because, even under a new speedy permitting process announced by Davis three 
weeks ago, it still can take months to line up equipment and get it 
constructed and on line. 
The dilemma for California this summer shapes up like this: various estimates 
predict that the amount of electricity that will be available will fall short 
of demand by 5,000 megawatts to nearly 7,000 megawatts, or enough electricity 
to power 5 million to 7 million homes. 
Davis has called for enough conservation to cut demand by 3,700 megawatts and 
has unveiled initiatives he hopes will boost generation by 5,000 megawatts. 
If successful, that would be enough to avoid rolling blackouts this summer, 
according to state energy officials. 
Nearly half of the new generation sought by Davis would come from peaker 
plants, including 1,000 megawatts of new peaker plants that the governor 
wants to attract to the state and another 1,300 megawatts from peaker plants 
to be built by energy firms that have signed contracts with the California 
Independent System Operator. 
There is uncertainty on both counts. The Department of Water Resources, which 
has stepped into the energy-buying field because of the financial collapse of 
the utilities that have backed the ISO's purchasing, is attempting to 
renegotiate some of the contracts energy companies entered into with the ISO. 
That has alarmed some contractors. 
And even if no agreements are scuttled through renegotiations with the water 
resources agency, the ISO never figured on seeing all 1,300 megawatts it 
signed up for to actually materialize. 
"We viewed the prospect of getting all 1,300 megawatts as unlikely," said 
Brian Theaker, ISO's manager of reliability contracts. "It was going to be 
very difficult, if not impossible, for all 1,300 megawatts to hit the 
ground." 
And even with a speedier licensing process, it might be difficult to get the 
other 1,000 megawatts of new peakers built in time for summer. 
"If you don't have the equipment in hand, it's very difficult to get it at 
this late stage of the game," Theaker said, citing conversations with 
industry officials. 
Still, state officials are confident that the governor's goals to boost power 
production from peaker plants and through increased energy conservation will 
work. 
"With increased generation and the reduction in demand, we should be able to 
avoid rolling blackouts this summer," said Energy Commission spokeswoman 
Claudia Chandler. 
Chandler said the new peaker plants, which can be transported on a flatbed 
truck and can be as small as a large backyard storage shed, still could be 
running by summer if applications are filed by mid-April. 
But the Energy Commission has yet to receive a single application for a new 
peaker power plant. 
"That kind of is putting us on pins and needles," Chandler said. "We are 
talking to developers, though. They indicate they will be submitting 
applications late this week or next." 
Meanwhile, Davis met in Washington, D.C., with Energy Secretary Spencer 
Abraham to discuss California's plans to buy 26,000 miles of electricity 
transmission lines now owned by three financially troubled utility companies. 
Speculation has surfaced in recent days that federal regulators are opposed 
to the plan and would reject it. Curtis Hebert, the chairman of the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission, has said the state takeover of the lines would 
be "against the best interests of the American public." 
A spokeswoman for the regulatory commission said Tuesday the panel has not 
discussed or taken a position on the California plan. 
Hilary McLean, a spokeswoman for the governor, characterized Davis' meeting 
with Abraham as "productive" and said the two had pledged to work together 
and continue discussing the issue. 
Davis is scheduled today to fly to New York, where he will meet with Wall 
Street analysts, before flying back to California tonight.

Davis fights for backing, takes state plan to D.C. 



'Lots of people' in capital wary of transmission-grid takeover
By Toby Eckert?
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE 
February 27, 2001 
WASHINGTON -- Gov. Gray Davis, worried about possible federal opposition to 
the state's plan to take control of California's power transmission system, 
said he will lobby Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham on the plan in a meeting 
today. 
"Clearly, we have to persuade lots of people in Washington that what we're 
doing is the right thing," Davis said yesterday, citing recent news reports 
that indicate opposition to the plan from the head of the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission, or FERC. 
The commission appears to have authority over approving the plan. 








Hydropower net needs a 'miracle' 
Edison: No more money to bury power lines underground 
? 



After joining other governors in a wide-ranging meeting with President Bush 
at the White House, Davis also said "there may be some give" on the Bush 
administration's opposition to price controls on wholesale electricity if 
power generators are assured a healthy profit. He did not elaborate. 
A White House spokeswoman said she was unaware of any change in the 
administration's stance on price controls. 
FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert has declined to comment on how the commission 
might rule on California's plan to acquire 26,000 miles of utility-owned 
electricity transmission lines as part of a strategy for solving the state's 
power crisis. 
But in an interview with the Dow Jones news service last week, he indicated 
the plan may run counter to FERC's policy of encouraging the development of 
regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, to manage access to power 
grids. 
"Anything that moves in the opposite direction of RTOs .?.?. is against the 
best interests of the American public," he was quoted as saying. 
Davis said Hebert's comments "raised concerns in my mind. And I want 
Secretary Abraham to understand the motivation for doing this is to solve the 
problem, allow the utilities to get back into business, pay off the 
generators and the banks, and begin to stabilize the market." 
While Abraham does not have direct authority over the issue, he is part of an 
energy policy team appointed by Bush. Davis sees winning Abraham's backing of 
the plan as a possible key to federal approval. 
"I think that team's assessment of the progress we're making will have a lot 
to do with how Washington responds, including the FERC," Davis said. 
Davis will also pitch his plans for ending the crisis to Wall Street analysts 
tomorrow. However, he said he had no meetings planned with FERC officials. 
The Democratic governor acknowledged that many California Republicans are 
philosophically opposed to the state buying the transmission lines. 
"Some people in Washington, I think, see this as more of an ideological 
statement" by the Democrat-controlled state government, Davis said. "As a 
governor, I see it as a practical solution to a problem we're trying to deal 
with." 
The state wants to acquire the transmission system from Pacific Gas and 
Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric as a 
condition for helping the utilities pay off some $13 billion in debt they 
have accumulated. The debt is a product of soaring costs for wholesale power 
that the utilities have been unable to fully recover from consumers under 
state law. 
Davis announced a tentative agreement last week to buy Edison's power lines 
for $2.76 billion. 
The purchase plan also will allow the state to upgrade the transmission 
system and fix bottlenecks in the flow of electricity within California and 
from neighboring states such as Arizona, Davis said. 
He and other governors stressed the importance of improving the power grid in 
a discussion yesterday with Abraham, Environmental Protection Agency 
Administrator Christie Whitman and Interior Secretary Gale Norton. 
"We'll need federal approval and, hopefully, federal assistance on the 
financing of those improvements" in California, Davis said. 
The governor has tangled with FERC on numerous aspects of the power crisis. 
The commission, which has authority over the wholesale power market, has 
resisted Davis' proposal to cap wholesale prices in the West. Bush and 
Abraham have, too. 
But Davis suggested that temporary "cost-plus" price limits -- in which 
wholesale rates would reflect the cost of producing the power, plus a set 
profit margin -- may still be an option. 
In San Diego yesterday, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., emphasized that 
California needed to resolve its own energy problems and rework its 
deregulation plan. But Hastert held out the possibility of caps on the 
wholesale price of electricity, which have bipartisan support from California 
representatives and senators. 
"Maybe we can do that on a short-term, focused way, but you have to go back 
and fix the legislation," Hastert said in a meeting with The San Diego 
Union-Tribune's editorial board. 
Davis indicated that he discussed the power crisis in general terms with Bush 
and would have a more detailed talk with Abraham. 
Bush "invited me to call on him directly if we need more assistance," Davis 
said.

Duke Energy Suspends Suits Vs. Calif.



LOS ANGELES (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Duke Energy Corp. suspended a lawsuit against
the state on Monday after the California Department of Water
Resources agreed to buy power from Duke that was formerly being
provided under contracts with two financially troubled utilities.


Duke said Monday it will suspend until April 30 its lawsuit
against Gov. Gray Davis, who had commandeered Duke's long-term
energy contracts with Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas
and Electric.


Duke sued Davis after the governor announced plans to allow the
California Power Exchange to sell the contracts as a way to pay
debts owed by SoCal Edison and PG&amp;E. The power generator argued
that Davis exceeded his authority under the state's Emergency
Services Act.


Under a settlement announced Monday, the water resources
department will buy power on behalf of residential and business
customers that was previously being delivered to Edison and PG&amp;E.


``We see this as progress. It's a step that takes us in the
positive direction,'' said Roger Salazar, spokesman for Davis.


Bill Hall, head of Duke's California operations, said the
agreement ``gives California consumers the benefit of the long-term
contract price that was negotiated with the utilities before they
defaulted. And it allows Duke to provide electricity through an
entity that can pay us for it.''


SoCal Edison and PG&amp;E, California's two biggest utilities, have
lost nearly $13 billion in part because the state's deregulation
plan prohibits them from passing on skyrocketing wholesale power
prices to consumers.


With SoCal Edison and PG&amp;E near bankruptcy, the California
Department of Water Resources was authorized last month to buy
power.


Duke said the interim settlement expires April 30, when a court
hearing on Duke's suit is scheduled in U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles.


Also on Monday, Duke suspended a case it brought against the
California Independent System Operator, which manages 75 percent of
the state's power grid.


Duke and other power generators sued the ISO after the water
resources department said it would not pay for power bought on the
expensive spot market. The ISO had said it would bill the nearly
bankrupt utilities for that power.


When power generators tried to pull out of the spot market, the
ISO sued and a federal judge ordered companies to keep selling to
the state. That order was allowed to expire last week while the
state and the generators work on a settlement.

Calif. Optimistic About Power Line



By DAVID HO
Associated Press Writer
WASHINGTON (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  -
California Gov. Gray Davis said Tuesday that
he is confident the Bush administration will support the state's
$2.7 billion proposal to ease energy woes by buying Southern
California Edison's electricity transmission system.


Supporters of the plan say it could lead to quick improvements
of a bottlenecked system overdue for repairs. But critics contend
the proposal saddles the state with an antiquated network that
could prove costly to fix.


Davis said he presented a nine-page proposal to Energy Secretary
Spencer Abraham and he expects a response by the end of the week.


Abraham ``wants this problem solved and he's been very
supportive,'' Davis said. ``He's recommended approval on every
request I've made, and I believe he will support our proposal.''


Energy Department spokesman Joe Davis said Abraham is reviewing
the proposal but wouldn't comment on whether he would endorse it.


On Friday, the governor announced a deal to purchase the power
lines and require Edison International, the utility's parent
company, to sell cheap power to the state for a decade.


Federal approval is required for the proposal, which does not
include the state's other major investor-owned utilities, Pacific
Gas &amp; Electric and San Diego Gas and Electric.


Negotiations are continuing with all three utilities to buy
their 26,000 miles of transmission lines for a cost that could
range from $4.5 billion to $7 billion.


Edison and PG&amp;E have said they have accumulated nearly $13
billion in losses because the state's 1996 deregulation law
prevented them from passing the true costs of wholesale energy to
their customers. The governor's plan would infuse the utilities
with part of the cash they need to remain solvent.


Some state lawmakers have said the long-term costs of the plan
outweigh the immediate benefits because the transmission lines need
repairs that could cost an estimated $1 billion a year.


Addressing a lunch for the California State Society attended by
members of the state's congressional delegation, Davis outlined his
plans to solve the power problems by building new power plants and
working with the energy industry.


``We have a real challenge this summer and the following
summer,'' he said. ``The third year I think enough generation will
be online so that we're in much better shape.''


Davis has issued executive orders to shorten the approval
process for new plants and expects to gain 5,000 megawatts by
summer _ enough to power about 5 million homes.


In addition to increasing power production, Davis emphasized the
need for greater conservation, advising his state's consumers to
turn off lights in empty rooms, unplug unused appliances and lower
thermostats.


``In my house, my wife has the thermostat down to 55 degrees,''
he said. ``Going to the kitchen in the middle of the night is like
a trip to Antarctica.''

Jim--I had a wide ranging social/business conversation with Curt Hebert on 
Saturday night at one of the inaugural events.  I'll call you to give you the 
details, including all the good things I said about you!!!  He was being 
quite negative about the WGA Feb 2 meeting in Portland, basically saying that 
his predecessor had committed to some positions that he was not in agreement 
with, and that he didn't think he wanted to participate.  I promised him that 
either you or I would call him after our Governor meetings this week to give 
him our sense of where the positions/players were going to shake out.  My 
initial thought was that we would want him there as a good voice on our side, 
but my second thought is that there might be a better strategy play not 
having FERC there.  As you saw by the e mail exchange last week between 
Cynthia Sandherr and me, the democrat senators Murray and Cantwell are also 
following this meeting, although I don't know if they are participating.

I'll call you tomorrow and fill you in on the conversation

Linda--I also made a small commitment on tobacco issues that I'll need to 
talk to you about!

Mona,  If you can get the opt-in removed it would be a great benefit to our 
effort.  6.5 cents is well below market at this point  and we can not compete 
against it.  I understand there is a true-up but do we know how this will 
work?  Given the lack market intelligence I would suspect customers will 
opt-in just because the price cap is lower than offers in the market.  
Please, do everything possible to remove this opt-in.  Thanks

Subject: Senate passes Alper/Davis Bill 30-0

AB 265 passed through the Senate a few minutes ago.  It now must go to the 
Assembly, where there is still a lot of uncertainty about what changes the 
Assembly will want to the bill.  We still haven't seen the latest 
"republican" language.

Also, AB 265 is double joined to AB 970, controversial siting bill.  To the 
extent one or the other fails, they both fail.

AB 265 (Davis/Alpert) has:

1.  a 6.5 cent/kWh energy rate cap through 2002, with potential extension 
through 2003.
2.  Applicable to residential, small commercial (up to 100 kW)
3.  Opt-in provision for large industrial/agricultural customers at 6.5 cents 
with an annual true-up
4.  Use of revenues from utility generation assets (including PPA) to offset 
undercollections.
5.  Reasonableness review for San Diego G&E

Will update with more information as available.

No news about SCE.

Want to have fun?  Want to get on a game show?  Want to help Millions?  
Tomorrow you will receive an email that allows you to answer 15 questions via 
email responses (about United Way, Enron, and other fun items).  
Participation with correct answers puts you in the drawing for the employees 
to represent Corp. in a "Who wants to be a Millionaire?" game that will be 
played to benefit United Way on August 9.  The lucky and smart 
representatives will be playing for great prizes.  

I encourage your participation in the game, but more importantly, encourage 
your generous participation in Enron's United Way campaign.  Thanks for your 
help and HAVE FUN!

Subject: Enron's PaineWebber Service

Rocky Emery, the Dowd family, Kim Bowden, and another 15 or so employees of 
UBSPaineWebber (our stock tracking provider...options, restricted stock, etc) 
left yesterday evening without any warning.  They went to 1st Union.

I've set up a meeting at 2pm today for us to go over to UBSPW and make sure 
they understand the special needs of Enron and to make sure our service will 
not be affected.

I am reviewing the contract in place between PW and Enron to understand the 
affects of this move by Emery and his staff on the agreement.  Also, I'm 
going to see about getting 2 providers of the stock tracking service from the 
following list:  (in case this happens again, we'll have a solid back-up 
immediately)

UBSPaineWEbber (our current provider)
1st Union (where Rocky Emery went)
Solomon Smith Barney (way ahead of the competition from a technology 
standpoint...and has done the two provider thing before)
Prudential (another option with internal connections)

let me know if you think I should include any others or would like to discuss.

Thanks,
Aaron

Subject: FERC's Prospective Mitigation and Monitoring Plan for CA Wholesale 
Electric Markets

The following report is comprised of what was discussed at the Commission 
meeting held tonight at approximately 7 PM EST and additional intelligence 
gathered from FERC staffers after the meeting by Joe Hartsoe:

Physical Withholding -- To prevent physical withholding, the plan will 
require sellers with PGA's to offer all their available power in real time.  
All California generators, even those not subject to FERC price regulation, 
will be required to sell into the ISO's real time market as a condition of 
their use of the ISO's interstate transmission lines. Hydroelectric 
facilities will be exempted. (24-7 for 1yr) 

Price Mitigation -  The plan will establish a single market clearing price 
auction for the real time market.  During Stage 1, 2 and 3 emergencies in the 
ISO's real time market, each generator (other than hydro) with a 
participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power 
and bid its marginal cost based on the generator's heat curve, emission 
rates, gas costs and emission costs, plus $2 for O&M.  The gas cost will be 
the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California; 
emissions are to be based on Cammon Fitzgerald(?).  The gas cost and 
emissions will be published the day after, for use on the following day.  A 
single market clearing price is determined in real time for all generators.  
Highest bid sets the clearing price.  Each gas fired generator must file with 
FERC and the ISO, on a confidential basis, heat and emission rates for each 
generating unit.  The ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost 
for each generator, including maintenance and operating costs.  In the event 
a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price, the generator must, 
within 7 days of the end of each month, file a report with FERC and the ISO 
justifying its price.  FERC has 60 days to review/act.  No opportunity costs 
in real time.  Marketers are in the same boat, as they must be prepared to 
justify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with 
no opportunity cost.  However, credit sleeves are permissible.

Demand Response - Beginning June 1, only public utility load serving entities 
must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be 
curtailed under those bids.  FERC is attempting to break the demand curve.  
(24-7)  

Outages -- PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced 
outages in accordance with the Commission Staff proposal adopted by FERC. 

Term - Order expires one year from date of issuance.

RTO Filing - California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June 1 
or Order lapses with no further effect.

ISO Reporting - On September 14, 2001, ISO must file a status report on how 
things are working and how much generation has been built.  Comments are due 
in 15 days.  Quarterly reports thereafter.

Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds - The market based rate 
authority of all public utilities is conditioned on 1) no physical withhold 
of capacity, and 2) no inappropriate bidding behavior.  Inappropriate bidding 
behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the 
generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit 
behavior.  An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be 
inappropriate.  In addition, "hockey stick" bids are expressly prohibited 
(i.e.  bidding 95% at marginal cost and 5% at a much higher level).

Limited 206 filing - Applies to sales in the WSCC, outside California.  
Refund conditions apply in real time spot markets when contingency within a 
control area falls below 7%.  Control areas are not required to publish when 
this condition occurs.  Apparently anything over marginal cost must be 
justified.  All marketers and non-hydroelectric generators must offer to sell 
contractually and physically available capacity/energy to a location within 
WSCC.  FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California.  
Comments are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations.  The refund effective 
date is 60 days from publication of the Order.

Nox Limits in California --  Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is 
prohibited from running by law.  However, it appears that incurring fines 
does not overcome the must sell requirement- just include the fines as part 
of the price bid.  Also if Nox is limited, may seek to show that generation 
would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price.  

Surcharge to pay past amount due -- Comments are due in 30 days on 1) whether 
FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into an escrow 
account to pay past costs and 2) the effect this surcharge would have on the 
PG&E bankruptcy filing.  

No mention was made at the meeting as to issue of exports of power from 
California.  The Order is not finally drafted as of yet, and the status of 
the foregoing items could change upon issuance of the Final Order.  We will 
keep you posted.

Here is the summary Jeff Dasovich sent regarding yesterday's conference call.

Greetings:
In order to keep everyone in the loop, the folks on today's call wanted to 
send out a brief summary of the call for the benefit of those who couldn't 
make it.  Apologies for any omissions, inaccuracies, etc.  Others who were on 
the call please chime in if I've gotten anything wrong, or missed anything.

Best,
Jeff

SUMMARY
Enron, Duke, El Paso and Williams were on the call, as was Michael Hoffman of 
the Blackstone Group (the Governor's financial advisors).
On the subject of how the group would organize itself, it was agreed that the 
calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate.
A smaller group consisting of Duke, El Paso, Enron, and Williams would take 
the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento, meeting with policy makers, and 
advocating whatever plan the group develops.
Folks agreed that achieving a comprehensive solution requires a tangible 
process; that is, the principals need to get in a room, face to face, for 
however long it takes to work out a resolution.
It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of 
next week, and that it should take place in Sacramento.
It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to be 
brought into the process as soon as possible, i.e., next week.
There was some discussion regarding the release today of "Plan B."  Plan B is 
a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an alternative to 
the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison.  After that call I received a 
copy of "Plan B."  If you'd like a copy please send me your fax number.
Folks on the call agreed to have the next "supplier-only" call-in meeting on 
Friday.
Finally, Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a "ratings agency 
level" presentation prepared by the end of the week.  The goal of the 
presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state seeks to 
issue are solidly backed by retail rates.

The Agenda for Tomorrow's Call with the Governor's Staff
Item #1:  The Credit Issue
Michael Hoffman said that the Governor's office wants to start tomorrow's 
meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue.  
Hoffman said that the Governor's folks are hoping to have completed by the 
start of tomorrow's meeting a draft of an agreement between the California 
PUC and CDWR.  The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR gets paid for 
power services delivered.  
If the draft is ready, they'd like to discuss on the call tomorrow.  

Item #2:  Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution.
It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow's meeting 
the universe of issues that need to be included in a comprehensive solution.
Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are.  The 
following is a brief outline, which is not intended to be definitive, but a 
starting point for discussion.
Utility creditworthiness
retail rates must reflect costs
Increase supply
streamline and otherwise reform the siting process
Decrease demand
establish real-time pricing
implement demand buy-down and other conservation programs
Create a real market
Remove the State from the power-buying business as soon as possible (e.g., 
once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to creditworthiness; 
approximately 3-6 months)
Return the procurement role to the utilities
Reinstate Direct Access immediately for all customers
Within 18-24 months, create a "core/noncore" market structure for 
electricity, similar to California's market structure for natural gas
Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector
Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission, generation, 
etc. 
Resolve outstanding legal claims, investigations, etc.
Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment (understanding that 
discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion)

The Governor cancelled the meeting at the last minute.  Apparently, he was 
trying to schedule a meeting with Clinton and our meeting conflicted, so we 
were bumped.  We are trying to set a new time.  I will share with the 
Governor's energy advisor the information and recommendations all of you 
helped put together.  Thanks

I will be on the first panel of the FERC California conference on Thursday.  
The format allows a 5 min presentation and then 60 min of Q&A.  I need your 
help to make sure I have "Gore-like" command of the details.  Please help 
with the following information:
Enron project information (Parquet/McCubbin) -- please give me any 
presentations or summaries you have on the generation, or firm purchases, we 
have under way (or planned).  I'll talk with you to find out what we are 
comfortable disclosing but please err on the side of giving whatever 
information you have.
Updated Belden presentation (Hain/Belden) -- I believe the latest information 
was as of August; I think some of the information on the cost of peaking 
facilities is particularly eye-opening on the price cap issue.
Comparison to PJM (Hartsoe/Novosel) -- Is the information we are seeking from 
the ISO and PX similar to information PJM already provides?  If so, it would 
be nice to tie our requests back to something the Commission has already 
approved.
Cancelled DSM projects (Mahoney) -- Again, I'll only use what we feel 
comfortable with, but it would help make our point if we can give examples of 
how price caps backfire when it comes to encouraging conservation.
ISO/PX reports (Dasovich).  I have the ISO market surveillance report.  Is 
there another ISO report?  If so, please get me a copy and provide a copy of 
the PX report too.
CEC/Proposed generation update (Mara/Parquet) -- Need the basic information: 
proposed, waiting for permitting; how much/little the legislation did to 
expedite siting (ie are we still comfortable saying that it applies to less 
than 10%)?
Soft cap(Belden/Hain) -- need a crisp explanation of why the "soft" nature of 
the cap is not sufficient.  Also, would we be OK if the Commission revised it 
to say that bids can be taken above 150 without special filing or reporting 
requirements, but those bids will be accepted at the price bid rather than 
applying to all lower bids as well (ie the highest bid at or below 150 clears 
the market, bids above 150 accepted at price bid as needed)?
Offers we have made/deals done (Parquet/Dasovich/ Mccubbin) -- Roseville plus 
any others, offer made to SDG&E -- I want to make the point that the market 
will provide solutions (below the retail price cap) if we get the utility 
(and the regulators) out of the merchant function.
Herding the cats(Hartsoe/mccubbin/mara/dasovich):  We are asking FERC to be 
courageous, do the right thing and ignore the politics.  To be even halfway 
credible, we can't have IEP, EPSA, Dynegy or anyone else "squishing" on the 
price cap issue..  We have never been closer to reform in California, we need 
these guys on board.
Thanks.

Steve,  a recent hire within my group of Risk Management ,  Samuel  Harrell  
is on two energy associations.   They are the  Association of Energy Services 
Professionals International (AESP) and the American Association of Blacks in 
Energy (AABE).  Sam is a member of good standing in both and has recently 
been nominated to join the Board of Directors for the AESP.   I was not sure 
if Enron had any special requirements concerning registration of employees in 
associations or not.    If I need to do anything specific I would appreciate 
your guidance.  Hopefully this will work as the needed notice.    Thanks

Attached is a memo comparing the CEC's forecasted supply and a more realistic 
look at what additional resources might be available this summer.

The bottom line is that:

1.  The CEC significantly underestimates the outages that may occur this 
summer.  They estimate in their 5,000 MW supply deficit for the summer that 
expected outages will be around 3,000MW.  However, November and December saw 
significantly higher outage levels.  (7,265 MWs) The FERC has investigated 
these outages and found no improprieties- just that the plants are overtaxed 
from running at higher than normal capacities.

2.  There are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the 1,244 MWs of projected 
supply from rerating/restarting existing thermal and renewable projects.  It 
is very unclear how much of this will be able to come on line by this summer, 
if at all.  As evidenced by the e-mail I sent out this morning, local 
communities may be very opposed to restarting shut down units.  In addition, 
these units are likely to be uneconomical.

3.  In the existing resource pool, there are roughly 1,430 MWs of peaking or 
other generation units that are running up against their operating hour 
limitations from air quality regulations.  The Governor has ordered the local 
air quality districts to address these restrictions,  We are beginning to 
seem some movement; however, the US EPA has yet to weigh in on these relaxed 
standards.

4.  The distributed generation/back-up generation capacity to make up some of 
the shortfall is still an unknown.  While there has been some relaxing of the 
limitations on run hours for back-up generation at "essential public 
services" the increase in DG is expected from "clean" sources, not diesel 
emergency generators.

5.  The CEC is doing everything it can to get 50+ MW peaking units on-line by 
this summer.  They are promising a 21-day permit application approval process 
and are offering to pay half of the cost of offsets, for "clean" sources of 
generation in critical areas.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.

I don't really have a problem with this, but I thought that all VP promotions 
were supposed to go through our year end process.  That's what I have been 
saying in response to the inquiries I am getting.  Ken, being newly back in

Dear Sir and Madam.

I did not know whom to contact at Enron, so chose to contact you.  I am a 
Ph.D candidate at the University of Rhode Island.  My speciality is English 
and Business Communication.

I am contacting you because I a person I know has applied and given a 
high-end position within your company.  Please check his credentials.  He is 
presenting himself as a Brown University Graduate with an MBA from another 
college.

Please be advised, I did a reference check with Brown, and he is not a Brown 
graduate.  His name is Steven R. Hill.  

I feel obliged to divulge this information to you because of the law that 
holds me responsible for knowing that someone might be purposely 
misrepresenting themselves.

		 Subject: Final Status Report of EBS East Asia Regulatory Matters

 As many of you know, I am going to be leaving Enron to pursue new 
opportunities.  
  I am leaving with regret,  as I have enjoyed working with all of you, and I 
believe EBS
  is poised for great success in Asia.   To assist in a smooth transition,  I 
have prepared 
  this report on  the status of all EBS East Asia regulatory affairs actions 
I am working on, 
  and my thoughts about next steps.    A list of key contacts is also 
provided.    Mark 
  Schroeder will reassign pending actions.   

   Again, many, many thanks for your support and encouragement and for what I 
have 
   learned about broadband and EBS from each of you. 

1.   Singapore

 (a)  SBO License Application:   

        The application was completed in draft in December.   Dan Arzola of 
EBS Asia 
        has a copy in Houston.   We cannot proceed further on the application 
until we 
        decide what  legal entity to use.   We have a legal entity (Enron 
Broadband 
        Services Pte Ltd) set up that encompasses all EBS activities 
including bandwidth t
        trading.   

        The legal entity that we use in the application will have to pay a 1% 
annual gross
        turnover fee unless we get it waived by the regulator on the grounds 
that the 
        turnover fee was never intended to capture bandwidth trading 
revenue.   This 
        is a possible option in my opinion as the regulator (IDA) does not 
want to be working at cross
        purposes with other parts of the government that wish to provide EBS 
with incentives.  
        See below.
     
    (b)  Legal Due Diligence:
   
        However, before pursuing a waiver from IDA,  we were planning to 
complete legal due 
        diligence to examine any options for avoiding the fee without a 
waiver.   
        Donald is of the view (see his Jan 9 e-mail ) that bandwidth trading 
has to be
        licensed by the regulator.  ( In Europe, bandwidth trading usually 
does not 
        require telecom licensing.)   If Donald is correct as he probably is, 
there may be 
        less need of further legal research  on that point unless perhaps to 
confirm absolutely 
        that there is no way to shield EBS bandwidth trading from the 
turnover fee apart from
        a waiver or reduction of the fee.    For example it is possible  that 
Jan Haizmann 
        or others may figure out a way to have actual trades escape the fee 
(done offshore 
        for example).   Jan I believe has some ideas on this that he adanced 
in the context
        of Korea.  

        I believe it would still be prudent  to proceed as we had planned to 
engage
        a law firm here in Singapore (as we have in Hong Kong and Japan) for 
the purpose 
        of guiding us through these sorts of questions (or at least 
confirming our reading)
        and answering the many other questions posed in a matrix developed by 
a working 
        group headed by Wayne Gardner.   We will likely be needing the firm 
anyway at 
        some point.  
        
        I have prepared a list of seven law firms engaged in telecoms 
practice in Singapore.
        EBS General Counsel is planning to examine its Asia strategy and whom 
to send and
        when to engage a firm to complete Wayne's questionnaire and for other 
purposes.

         My advice is, after the due diligence is completed or we have at 
least confirmed
         that bandwidth trading is required to be in the licensed entity,  
probably to go to the IDA and 
         discuss the implications of the fee for us.   The contacts I would 
suggest discussing this
         with are Andy Haire and Fiona Yeo (see contact list).]      IDA does 
not wish to prevent 
         EBS's coming to Singapore, and the fee was of course set up without 
bandwidth trading
         specifically in mind as a revenue source.   Bandwidth trading was 
referenced in the
         Code only later as a result of Enron's comment letters.

  (c)  Arthur D Little consultant proposal to support EBS Pioneer Status 
Application

         This 75k proposal is now with us in final form, after undergoing 
changes by me
         and two by our Houston tax lawyers.   I was to have gone to ADL 
Singapore next
         for a meeting to question them on how much of this they are able to 
         do independently without reliance on us.   This was a suggestion 
made by
         Jim Ginty of EBS tax to make sure they would not be reprocessing our 
info,    
         I also intended to get them to pinpoint which of the products would 
be quantified,
         rather than a "where appropriate."     Assuming we proceed with this 
proposal, 
         someone else will need to do this conversation with ADL Singapore.   

         I have forwarded the final proposal to Wayne Garder and Mark and 
most other
         interested parties earlier this week.

        NB:   Someone needs to be appointed to contact Simon MacCormac at ADL 
and explain
        at least our timing and process for getting back to him, as a 
courtesy.   I have not 
        replied to his final submission as of now.   See contact info at end 
of e-mail.

         For background,  the reason I believe EBS needs this work and sought 
a consultant
         proposal is that Pioneer Status is typically awarded  to companies 
that make major
         dollar, infrastructure, and job-creation expenditures in 
Singapore.   Our business
         model does just the opposite.   So, to be awarded Pioneer Status, 
which the EDB is
         very willing to consider us for after many months of persuasion,  I 
believe we need to  
         help EDB demonstrate what the quantitative spin-off benefits are for 
Singapore from our
         developing bandwidth trading here (e.g. increased efficiencies of 
capacity utilization,
         effect of lower bandwidth prices on attracting investment).   This 
is a job for a  development 
         economist teamed with someone who knows about bandwidth trading.   
To my mind,
         if ADL cannot produce the bandwidth trading specialist we want, it 
might be worth it 
         to have one of our experts assigned to liaise with  them, and adjust 
the contract
         accordingly to reflect what part we are providing.         

         One thing the ADL scope of work does not provide for is the actual 
completion of
         the Pioneer Status Application - only the supporting economic 
analysis.  That is because it is
         proper for us to be the ones outlining our business plan for 
Singapore, rather than
         running that information through ADL and charging its overhead.  The 
idea is to get
         ADL to perform the quantitative economic development analysis we 
cannot do in-house.  

    (d)   Direct contact with EDB on EBS's plans

         EDB (Chelsia Lim ) has this week asked EBS to update her on its 
business
         plans for Singapore.    I have made sure Craig Clark will take the 
responsibility
         for seeing this is handled.   While a courtesy call is fine, I would 
advise 
         not to brief her formally until EBS has really decided what our 
plans are,
         with staffing, etc.   They have been asking for our plans for a 
while, and
         are waiting for some specifics when we have them.


2.    Hong Kong

        We have  2 licenses:   IVANS (value added services) and ETS (external
        telecoms services (includes bandwidth trading).

        There are several documents in draft and clearance which need to be 
filed
        under these licenses before we are able to operate in Hong Kong.  
        The principal ones are (a)  the system configuration plan,   (b) the 
tariff for
        sale and trading of circuits under the ETS license (c) the tariff for 
Mediacast 
        services under the IVANS license, and (later) (d) a tariff for 
VOD/EOD to
        be filed under the IVANS license.

        (a)  status of system configuration plan:

        The plan is done in draft and is being held pending a decision to be
         communicated by Roger Estrada within the next week or two as to 
whether 
         the Lucent 10G equipment described in the plan will be changed to 
other 
         equipment.    The HK lawyers  (Michelle Chan of Clifford Chance)  
have said 
         that if we plan to provide other equipment at the outset, we ought 
to just
         wait and send in the correct description rather than revise.   If we 
do stick with
         the Lucent equipment , we will also need to revise our orginal 
license 
         application as well (says Michelle Chan)  to include description of 
related
         Cisco equipment that was not mentioned in our orginal license 
application.

         When the system configuration plan is done in final, we also need to 
         change the listed destination in the diagram from "San Jose"  to 
"West Coast
         USA,  Japan, Singapore, and Australia".

         There are two copies of the present draft submission typed on the 
OFTA forms. 
          I have given one to Craig Clark of EBS to carry back to Houston.  
The other
         copy is with Annie Ng in our Singapore office.

         When we know what equipment we are going to be using, Tom Wei needs 
to
         revise the diagram and also make the changes in destination referred 
to above.
         Other small edits need to be made in Appendix A (see Dec 28 e-mail 
referenced
         below).   My successor should review the whole package once more 
with Michelle
         Chan in final.    Then the final package needs to be cleared by 
Anthony Duenner
         and our EBS lawyers before going to Ken Rice or another qualified 
Director of
         our Hong Kong company for signature.   After that it goes back to 
Michelle Chan
         for filing with OFTA.

         NB:   See Michelle Chan's e-mail of Dec 28, being repeated 
separately, for 
                  further information.  

       (b)   Tariffs for BWTrading under ETS License 

        In December in Houston I worked with Bill White and his staff on a 
tariff plan for
        bandwidth trading in HK.   Based on a meeting I had with the 
regulator in Hong 
        Kong,   we agreed to file pro forma ceiling prices rather than an 
entirely new
        and variable system which the regulator insisted we not do.   
Ceiling  prices 
        were developed and submitted to Michelle Chan for review.   

        Along with the prices we are required to submit our Terms and 
Conditions.   For 
        that I used EBS General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) for trading 
obtained from 
        Robbi Rossi and Michelle Heard.  Mike Grimes  has a set as well.   

        Present status:  Right now a dialogue is under way between Michelle 
Chan and  
        Robbi Rossi as to whether it is sufficient to file the GTC's alone or 
whether 
        certain exhibits, service level agreements, and confirmations 
referred to in
        the GTC's must also be filed.   There are other questions being 
discussed in
        that channel  such as how to handle variations in the terms based on
        commercial dynamics.     All these e-mails will be  forwarded.   Once 
these
        issues related to the GTCs are resolved, the tariff for bandwidth 
trading should
        be filed, going through Michelle Chan.

        NB:  See Michelle Chan e-mail of 1/09/01 which being forwarded 
separately.


     (c)  Tariff for Media Cast under IVANS license:

       I worked with Leroy Ho and Ken Wang in December and we submitted the 
main
       part of the Media Cast tariff to Michelle Chan.   However, we still 
need to get the
       Terms and Conditions for Media Cast from Robbi Rossi or Michelle Heard 
and
       attach them to the tariff diagrams and submit them to Michelle Chan. 
       
       NB:   See my e-mail to Michelle Chan of Dec 21 which being repeated.
       Someone needs to work with EBS legal to get the T and C's for Media 
Cast to Michelle
       or to set up direct channel between EBS legal and Michelle Chan as in
       the case of the exchanges on the T and C's for Bandwidth trading 
referred
       to above.

      (d)   Overall change of responsibility for EBS Regulatory HK 

        Michael,  or whomever will be taking over these responsibilities, 
should 
        get from Michelle Chan of Clifford Chance Hong Kong a fresh copy of 
        Alison Lindsay's letter to Xi Xi of October 2000 stating that we 
received 
        our licenses and setting forth in detail all of the requirements.   
This is the 
        master document ("bible") on compliance under our licenses and will 
catch any
        detail not included above.   For example:

            - my successor should also file a new form with OFTA,  the Hong 
Kong 
              regulator (form is included in the attachments to the letter)  
naming 
              himself the point of contact, replacing me.    Michelle Chan 
can forward
              the letter to the regulator.

           -  we will need to be selecting an independent auditor to certify 
certain routine
              reports we may need to file in future.   I have not started on 
that.


3.    Korea

       Robbi Rossi needs to call Kim and Chang (law firm we use in Korea)
       to authorize them to research and provide advice to us on how to 
handle 
       the apparent regulatory impediment to Bandwidth Trading in Korea that
       we identified during my November trip.

       Once Kim and Chang starts work on this, someone from regulatory should
       be made available to help guide Kim and Chang on our regulatory 
       questions, in coordination with Robbi Rossi.

       The key e-mails are (a) one from me outlining the overall problem and
        some suggestions for dealing with it ;  (b) one from Jan Haizmann 
with 
        some additional and in some cases alternative suggestions on how
        to deal with it,  (c)  two from Jae Moo Lee in Korea with additional
        points of view.  These will be forwarded.  


  4.   Japan  

       Our regulatory consultant is Art Yanagawa.   Contact info below.  Mike 
Grimes 
       and I have been in meetings with him and  Mike is fully briefed to 
carry on the 
       on-the-ground  part of contacts with Art.   Art also responds to 
Donald and 
       Roger Estrada and relies on them for guidance and input.     

      At some point it should be thought through who should be the point 
person
      to manage  this contract and approve payments, or decide to leave things
      as they are with approvals done in Houston.    The present system works 
but
      it is not clear to me who is responsible for what.  

      Art has prepared the amendment to our Special Type 2  license to add
      service to other destinations.   The latest status was that he was 
holding
      the amendment over the holidays while clarifying some points raised by
      Mike Grimes.    Someone needs to be assigned responsibility for
      getting the amendment through.  

      General Concern:      

      A more general regulatory concern for us in Japan is that our 
consultant 
      advises us that we cannot use the term bandwidth trading  in 
      communications with the government because it is not something 
      contemplated in the Telecom Business Law,  so is prohibited if 
      stated as we would state it elsewhere.   

      We therefore are having to go through elaborate contortions to make 
      what we are planning to do actually look like we are doing something
      else.    I admit that I agree with the approach we are taking for now 
and 
      can offer nothing better for the immediate term.    

      However, I would say that long term we are running some risks.    If we 
      are going to make Japan  one of the centerpieces of our  Asia EBS 
      strategy,   I think we need to consider devoting more full time EBS 
      regulatory resources to Japan exclusively.    

       The allocation problem is that whatever regulatory resources we apply 
       have to focus on  immediate license amendment  and operational
       questions that drive out time to work effectively on long term
       issues such as how to go about amending the Telecommunications 
       Business Law  to allow bandwidth trading explicitly.    This would seem
       important to reduce long term risks to our business strategy. 

5.    "Digital Divide"

       I had been giving intermittent support to helping Scott Yeager and 
Justin
       Cornett of EBS, and Will Reed of Technology for All, figure out how
       to expand the concept of Technology for All to Asia.    The strategy
       was to utilize some of Japan's $15 billion pledge of funds to support
       digital divide activities in Asia - to support the expansion into Asia 
of
       the EBS-supported TFA model.    This work will cease unless it can 
       be picked up by Laura Lannarone of corporate social responsbility 
       or Steve Burns of the DC office.

Steve is out of the country this week - but I checked his schedule and it 
looks like Nov. 29 in DC would work best. 

I will go ahead and pencil that in on Steve's schedule.

 <<jenbio revised_.doc>>  Leslie -- Thanks a million for getting back to me
so quickly.  Yes, I'd be willing to relocate.  I'm more interested in how
challenging the work would/could be (and the level of pay) then where I am
physically located.  Attached is my resume.  Feel free to send it to the
headhunter who called you and/or to anyone you think might be interested at
Enron.  Jennifer

PS  I had never talked to Schaefer before the Boise meeting.  He was not
very impressive and I agree with your assessment that you will not be able
to persuade him on the price cap issue.

A "dedicated room" isn't as bad as it sounds.  It would not be in use full 
time and the only equipment requirements are 4 screens (which one of the team 
rooms can accomodate) and a network connection (which the team rooms already 
have).  Let me know what you think.  Also: I talked to Salisha about Lara's 
move and it's ok with me (I think we were originally concerned that she 
wanted space we were setting aside for graphics, but she is actually moving 
deeper into her group (and next to her files)).

Subject: Dedicated eSpeak Room

Steve and Mark:

eSpeak is gaining tremendous momentum to become the communication vehicle for 
Enron's business units. In the first quarter of 2000, we estimate at least 
one eSpeak session per week -- and growing.  Jeff and Joe have personally 
committed to an Office of the Chairman eSpeak event every two weeks.  Cliff 
Baxter, Cindy Olson and Tom Gros are scheduled for January events.  We are in 
the process of scheduling Ken Lay, Ken Rice, Kevin Hannon, Marty Sunde and 
Joe Hillings.

As eSpeak events currently take place in different locations, there is an 
incredible amount of time and energy required to set up and test the 
equipment and infrastructure for each event.  It is crucial to have a 
dedicated eSpeak room.  Preferably this room should be on the 47th floor 
where the eThink team can train executives in advance and conduct each eSpeak 
session.  The ideal and most efficient scenario would be to set up the 
equipment (four terminals) in an office space on 47, where the equipment will 
be secure and the Public Affairs group can still use the office as extra work 
space.

We request your authorization to move forward.  As we are moving into new 
space, this is the perfect time to dedicate a room.

Please feel free to call me at x39843 or Marie at x39698.

Sincerely,

The eThink Team

Subject: DRAFT - AA PRC MEMO

Attached is a draft memo (including attachments) outlining the modifications 
we discussed last week.  We can communicate changes by email, or I'll be 
happy to arrange a short conference call.  If possible, I would like to 
distribute this by Wednesday or Thursday of this week.  After the four of us 
reach consensus, I suggest we preview Cindy (and maybe the HR heads) prior to 
distributing.  

You will note that based on conversations I had with Skilling last week 
(where he emphasized his desire that we have one program, rather than a 
fractured program by business unit), I have added a review of the business 
unit distributions to the final meeting where we discuss the top perfomers.  
I've also added Janet Dietrich (tent.) and another EES person (tbd) to the AA 
Committee, since they have a large group of AAs and no representation on the 
committee.  

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments, and thanks for your 
help.  Ted and Terry did all the hard work.

Regards,
Billy

We do not have the Europe groups included.  Should probably include, or note 
in the memo itself that info is forthcoming.

GOVERNOR DAVIS PRESSES FERC FOR ACTION ON WHOLESALE POWER RATES: Calls on
Federal Regulators to Reduce Prices, Issue Refunds

GOVERNOR DAVIS NAMES KAHN CHAIR OF THE GOVERNOR'S CLEAN ENERGY GREEN TEAM



OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----
PR00:238
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 12, 2000

GOVERNOR DAVIS PRESSES FERC FOR ACTION ON WHOLESALE POWER RATES
Calls on Federal Regulators to Reduce Prices, Issue Refunds

SAN DIEGO - At a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) hearing today
in San Diego, Governor Gray Davis reiterated his call to federal regulators
to intervene "to the fullest extent possible" to lower electricity prices in
California.

"FERC bears responsibility to ensure that a workably competitive market
exists before California consumers and California's economy are subjected to
unconstrained, market-based electricity prices," said Governor Davis in a
statement read by Energy Oversight Board Chairman Michael Kahn.
"Consequently, I renew my prior request that the Commission act with utmost
speed to intervene to the fullest extent possible to restore wholesale
prices to fair levels and to remedy harms that have resulted from the
exercise of market power."

Governor Davis noted that he and state lawmakers have taken dramatic action
in recent weeks to provide rate relief. "While these actions should provide
short-term rate predictability and longer-term benefits to customers in
terms of improved supplies, the fundamental problem of exorbitant wholesale
prices still exists and remains the responsibility of FERC to address," said
the governor. "No combination of state actions can substitute for federal
action to ameliorate the problems of California's wholesale markets."

Governor Davis has taken the following actions in reaction to rising
electricity prices in San Diego:

On June 14, he called for emergency reduction of electricity use by all
state facilities in the San Francisco Bay area in response to electricity
emergency and rolling blackouts.

On June 15, he called on chairpersons of the Public Utilities Commission
(PUC) to analyze the conditions that led to electricity shortages in the San
Francisco Bay area the previous day, including a statewide perspective on
the price and delivery of electricity. Report was completed, submitted to
the governor and released on August 2.

On July 27, 2000, Governor Davis called on federal and state regulators to
take swift action to extend the caps on wholesale electric rates in
California and provide San Diego ratepayers with million of dollars in
refunds.

In letters written by the governor to two state regulatory agencies and two
California-based panels charged with overseeing California's power market,
he called for a coordinated state effort to urge federal regulators to take
strong measures to reduce power rates in both the short- and long-term.

On August 2, 2000, Governor Davis issued three Executive Orders designed to
reduce energy consumption by state government and speed up the time it takes
new power generating facilities to win approval from state agencies.

On August 9, 2000, Governor Davis called on the Public Utilities Commission
(PUC) to establish a two-year plan that would cut electricity rates by
nearly half for residential and business customers of San Diego Gas &
Electric.

The governor also reached an agreement with the California Grocers
Association that will save enough electricity to provide power to between
50,000 and 60,000 homes during periods of peak demand, as grocers agreed to
reduce power consumption by 10 percent during Stage One emergencies.

On August 10, 2000, Governor Davis wrote a letter to President Clinton
urging him to expedite FERC's investigation to determine whether current
electric rates in San Diego were unjust.

On August 22, 2000, Governor Davis called on President Clinton to release
emergency funds from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)
to the state to help low-income Californians pay their rapidly-rising
electricity bills.

On August 23, 2000, President Clinton responded to Governor Davis' request
by releasing $2.6 million in emergency funds to help low-income Southern
Californians cope with the surge in their electricity bills. The President
also asked federal regulators to speed up their investigation into the
operation of U.S. power markets and urged the Small Business Administration
to use its credit programs to help small firms hurt by the price increases.

On August 23, 2000, Governor Davis reached agreement with legislators on
legislation to provide relief to San Diego ratepayers. The governor signed
two bills into law on September 6, 2000.

SEPTEMBER 12, 2000

STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS

TO THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION CONCERNING ITS INVESTIGATION OF
WHOLESALE PRICE ESCALATION IN CALIFORNIA

The Summer of 2000 has confronted California with an electricity crisis that
seriously threatens the safety, health and well being of citizens and
businesses throughout the state. At the heart of the crisis is the
extraordinary run up in prices for wholesale electric energy and ancillary
services, accompanied by deteriorating service and reliability. In San
Diego, electric customers' bills have more than doubled this summer,
threatening permanent harm to businesses and the health and welfare of
residential customers in the warm southern climate. All remaining California
electric consumers are faced with similar prospects as their legislated rate
freeze periods come to an end. In San Francisco we saw rolling blackouts for
the first time in our history.

As soon as the dimensions of the crisis became evident, I directed
California regulators, including the Public Utilities Commission and the
Electricity Oversight Board, and the Independent System Operator, to take
immediate steps to identify and implement specific measures to mitigate the
damage, including restoring price caps at Summer 1999 levels. I am happy to
report that those measures have been adopted, although not without
considerable resistance from self-interested parties.

In recent weeks, I have worked with the California Legislature to enact
further relief within the existing framework of options now available to the
state. These include provisions to stabilize retail rates, expedite
generation licensing where possible, implement targeted demand reduction and
demand response and remove constraints in transmission and distribution
systems. I have also established a task force comprised of key state
officials which is developing measures to increase energy efficiency and
alternative supplies and to expedite permitting by state agencies.

While these actions should provide short-term rate predictability and
longer-term benefits to customers in terms of improved supplies, the
fundamental problem of exorbitant wholesale prices still exists and remains
the responsibility of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to address.
No combination of state actions can substitute for federal action to
ameliorate the problems in California's wholesale markets.

A joint report submitted to me on August 2nd by the Chairman of the
California Electricity Oversight Board and the President of the California
Public Utilities Commission concluded that exorbitant wholesale prices in
California result from wholesale market dysfunction and the exercise of
market power by sellers. Subsequent reports by the Market Analysis
Department and the Market Surveillance Committee of the California
Independent System Operator reach the same conclusions. Subsequent behavior
of wholesale electric prices during August confirms their conclusions, and
subjects California to further economic damage. While I remain hopeful that
California wholesale markets may ultimately become competitive and become
capable of serving the interests of consumers and the public, I cannot and
will not accept the liabilities to California that result from the current
situation for even a short period. I intend to take any and all steps
necessary to restore economic stability to the electric service
infrastructure of California.

FERC bears the responsibility under its organic act to assure just and
reasonable wholesale electric rates. FERC bears responsibility to ensure
that a workably competitive market exists before California consumers and
California's economy are subjected to unconstrained, market-based
electricity prices. Consequently, I renew my prior request that the
Commission act with utmost speed to intervene to the fullest extent possible
to restore wholesale prices to fair levels and to remedy harms that have
resulted from the exercise of market power.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 12, 2000

GOVERNOR DAVIS NAMES KAHN CHAIR OF THE GOVERNOR'S CLEAN ENERGY GREEN TEAM
SACRAMENTO - Governor Gray Davis today announced the appointment of Michael
A. Kahn as chairman of the newly-created Governor's Clean Energy Green Team.
The Team was created by Governor Davis' signing of AB 970 by Assemblywoman
Denise Moreno Ducheny (D-San Diego) on Wednesday.

Mr. Kahn, 51, of San Francisco, is the chairman of the California
Electricity Oversight Board, and he also serves as vice-chair of the
California Commission on Judicial Performance. He has been senior partner
and head of litigation at Folger Levin & Kahn LLP since 1979. Mr. Kahn has
held numerous state and federal government appointments and assignments over
the last 15 years.

Mr. Kahn is the author of several articles and reports on litigation
practice and Supreme Court history. He is a magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa
graduate of the University of California, Los Angeles. Mr. Kahn also earned
master of arts and juris doctorate degrees from Stanford University, where
he was an editor of the Law Review. After graduation, he served for a year
as a law clerk to Judge Ben C. Duniway of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
in San Francisco.

The signing of AB 970 established the Governor's Clean Energy Green Team,
which works to streamline the process of creating new power plants to ensure
that an adequate supply of power will exist to make a deregulated
marketplace work. The Team does this by working with local governments,
identifying environmental impacts, developing recommendations for low
interest financing programs for renewable energy and obtaining input on
natural gas supply, emission offsets and water supply.

Members do not receive a salary. This position does not require Senate
confirmation.

I spoke with Jeff and he is not going to be available for the speech on the 
26th.  Do we pass or is there an alternative?  Can we get done what we need 
to get done with Ken's visit the following week?

Subject: Ken Lay/ Jeff Skilling visits

Ken Lay Visit. Following discussions with the Prime Minister's office and a 
quick check with venues 31 October is firming up as the preferred date for a 
meeting with the Prime Minister and an office opening by the PM. 

Jeff Skilling Visit. The Nikkei and the Tokyo University have now made the 
decision to invite Mr Skilling to give the key note address at the symposium 
on 26 November in Tokyo. As mentioned, the symposium is the most prestigious 
conference on IT in Japan.

While the conference itself receives significant media attention, the 
President of Nikkei has offered to interview Mr Skilling. This honour is 
usually reserved for Heads of State. The interview will be featured on the 
front page of the Nikkei and picked up by other major media services.

kind regards

Subject: Re: Ken Lay meeting with Japanese Prime Minister  

Ken Lay Visit. Balancing the need to push out the arrangement of high level 
meetings as far as possible with the desire to have a meeting with Prime 
Minister Mori prior to the US Presidential election, the week commencing 30 
October would be the optimum time for a visit by Mr Lay. PM Mori is generally 
available in that week. We will get a preferred time from the PM's chief 
secretary first thing tomorrow morning Tokyo time. 

Jeff Skilling Visit. The boards of Nikkei and Tokyo University Institute of 
Advanced Studies have yet to make a decision on the key note speaker for the 
one day invitation only seminar to be held on 26 October. As mentioned, the 
boards will choose between the chairman of Cisco and Jeff Skilling. The 
conference is focused on the IT revolution and an invitation only event for 
approximately 600 of Japan's corporate leaders.

The speaking panel and topics for discussion will be developed around the key 
note speaker. If Mr Skilling were to give the key note speech, it is likely 
that key senior Government Ministers would be asked to present at the 
seminar. 

Following the Prime Minister's commitment at the Okinawa summit of 
US$15billion expenditure in the region on IT infrastructure and education, 
Japan's focus on e-commerce is almost reaching fever pitch. There will be 
significant interest in the conference from senior levels of Government and 
the business community. Further, as you would expect with the involvement of 
the Nikkei, there is typically significant media coverage associated with the 
key note speaker's presentation.

kind regards

Subject: California Update 07.18.01

The Senate, the Assembly and the Governor are either poised to engage in very 
difficult negotiations, or the three are about to crash and burn and Edison's 
going to be left dangling.

In the Senate:
The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of 
the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee.
Burton announced during one of the two "informational" hearings that "this is 
it," despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the 
committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt.
The key features of the bill are:
Banks and QFs get paid in full.
Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers
No direct access.
There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill 
tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the 
Republicans will go along with it.

In the Assembly:
The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak, with 
Hertzberg's the likely winner.
That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the 
amendments describing the conditions were faxed today).
We're attempting to get the "July 12" date changed to "the effective date of 
the bill" or later.
The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the 
earliest.

The Problem:
The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each 
approaches the problem---in short, the bills are two ships passing in the 
night.
The Democratic leaders (Governor, Hertzberg, Burton) aren't talking, and 
Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody.

The likely outcome given the circumstances:  
Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e., passed out a "fair" bill); 
the Assembly and Senate can't agree; they finish the budget; time runs out; 
they leave Friday; and Edison's left twisting.

That said, there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit 
down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday, or begin 
talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out.  But given 
Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim.

In short, little has changed since yesterday.

Best,
Jeff

ABX1 60 (Hertzberg) was just scheduled for hearing this afternoon in the
Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee.  In brief, the bill
does the following:

Require, as a condition of certification by the CEC, that an applicant
offer to sell to an electrical
corporation, a municipal corporation, or the Department of Water
Resources, at a just and reasonable cost base price electrical power
generated by the facility.

This bill would also prohibit a person or entity, as defined, from
operating an electrical generation facility unless the person or entity
has submitted to the commission, within the time prescribed by
regulations adopted by the commission, a maintenance and outage
schedule, and the commission has approved that schedule.

Byzantine Practices? 
I was flying over Bolivia's Chiquitano Forest as I read your article on the 
"old-time gas company" Enron [BUSINESS, Aug. 28]. Over the past year, this 
forest, the largest remnant of intact primary dry tropical forest in the 
world, has been bisected by a 30-ft.-wide gash for construction of a gas 
pipeline by Enron and Shell. Enron in its quest for profit has ignored the 
scientific advice of conservation organizations to maintain the ecological 
integrity of this endangered forest ecosystem. Enron and Shell decided to 
open the 10 million- acre forest to fragmentation and deforestation by their 
pipeline. Enron may be keeping pace with advancing technologies to plow ahead 
in global markets, but its environmental practices are Byzantine and pose a 
global threat to biodiversity. PATRICIA CAFFREY World Wildlife Fund-Bolivia

Arena foes launch bid to defeat new plan 
By ERIC BERGER 
Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Wednesday, October 4, 2000
A handful of activists, including a Harris County Green Party official and 
several low-tax proponents, launched an effort Tuesday to defeat a second 
plan to build a downtown arena. 
Unlike the 1999 opposition campaign, this year's anti-arena movement is not 
seeking a better financing deal for taxpayers. These activists want no arena 
at all. 
Although this year's opponents lack the nearly $700,000 their higher-profile 
predecessors spent last year, that has done little to diminish their 
rhetoric. 
"Should we spend our city's limited resources on building up rich guys, or do 
we spend it building up our communities?" asked activist DeWayne Lark, 
standing in front of City Hall. "There will be no more corporate welfare in 
Harris County." 
Pro-arena campaign officials said Tuesday's event, which came about three 
weeks after their own kickoff, was more notable for who did not attend than 
for who did. 
Houston Aeros owner Chuck Watson, who funded a large chunk of last year's 
anti-arena effort, has endorsed the new deal. Gracie Saenz, a former city 
councilwoman and mayoral candidate who campaigned against the 1999 deal, also 
supports the new agreement. 
And although the Harris County Republican Party -- the primary organizer of 
the 1999 anti-arena effort -- has declined to support the new deal, it has 
not been as active in opposition as some of its members had hoped. 
In the GOP's stead this year is the Harris County Green Party, represented by 
Nathalie Paravicini, who said she rejects the argument that professional 
sports are critical to a city's identity. 
Arena boosters say a new downtown facility will promote Houston's image as a 
world-class city. 
"Civic pride is not measured by a sports team that is ready to leave town at 
the drop of a hat," she said. 
And organizers of the anti-arena campaign also suggested that conservative 
political activist Bruce Hotze would announce plans Thursday to take a major 
role in their efforts, possibly becoming campaign manager. 
Although Hotze lacks the political and financial stature of the pro-arena 
campaign co-chairmen, Enron Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay and 
former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan, he comes from a politically active 
family that can raise large amounts of money. 
Hotze has said he does not believe government should be involved in building 
sports stadiums, but he has declined to say how much he was willing to get 
involved in the anti-arena effort. 
Lark said Hotze told him that he will actively raise funds to fight the 
arena. The group is expected to form a political action committee this week 
to collect contributions. 
The philosophy of the anti-sports-arena efforts has reverted to its 1996 
form, when a similar grass-roots effort coalesced to oppose the referendum to 
build a baseball stadium, which voters approved. That underfunded effort also 
opposed any public spending on stadiums, rather than merely trying to extract 
a better deal from team owners. 
Arena proponents this year have attracted most of their former foes, and 
certainly the best-known, to their ranks by altering the original proposal, 
which failed with voters last year by 10 percentage points. 
Still, they acknowledge that there will always be opposition in high-profile 
contests. 
"We never expected this to be a unanimous vote," said Jordan, the co-chairman 
of the pro-arena campaign, Let's Build it Together. "Some people will vote 
against anything." 




FRANCE: Europe online power markets seen pressuring brokers.
By Stuart Penson

10/03/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

PARIS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Online trading is set to sweep through Europe's 
power markets, sending transaction fees sharply lower and piling the pressure 
on traditional brokers, industry executives and consultants said on Tuesday. 
Scores of web-based trading platforms, offering a variety of functions, are 
expected to enter the European wholesale power market in the near term, 
forcing brokers who work over the telephone to rethink their approach, they 
told an energy conference.
"Transaction fees in Europe are already falling and I think we're going to 
see a big decline over the next six months," said Gilbert Toppin, principal 
of Deloitte Consulting's European e-business practice. 
"Voice broking could become a distant memory," he told Reuters during the 
Powerisk 2000 conference. 
Leading the online charge in Europe's wholesale power market are EnronOnline, 
which launched last year, and HoustonStreet.com, which started up last week 
and is already planning to expand into Scandinavia. 
EnronOnline is a bilateral market in which Enron is always one party to a 
deal. HoustonStreet is a multilateral exchange. 
The major advantages for online markets over telephone brokers are seen as 
lower transaction costs and the ability to display a far wider range of 
prices to clients. 
Also, online trading is anonymous, which is attractive to traders, said Mark 
Crosno, president of electronic trading services at Altra Energy Technologies 
of the US. 
Altra is a partner with National Grid in EnMO in the UK, a consortium which 
runs a screen-based gas trading market and is planning to launch a power 
exchange. 
Many traditional brokers are still deciding how to respond to the online 
challenge. 
"A lot of brokers are scratching their heads because there are going to be 20 
or 25 electronic exchanges out there," said Per-Otto Wold, managing director 
of Natsource-Tullett Europe, one of Europe's biggest power brokers. 
Wold argued that doing a trade over the telephone was still, in most cases, 
the quickest method. And that would remain so until voice recognition enabled 
traders to "talk" to the screens on their desks. 
He expected brokers to focus on longer dated trades and options while online 
markets would capture a greater share of trading in short term, high volume 
contracts. 
The provision of market information and traders' liking for personal contact 
over the telephone would also help to preserve a niche for the voice brokers, 
said Wold. 
"The markets are still going to need somebody to massage the markets, and 
that is where the brokers come in," he said.

As I mentioned at the executive committee meeting, we have a number of people 
who either have expressed interest in serving on the transition team or who I 
would like to approach to serve on the transition team for Bush.  We believe 
that a call from you to Cheney may be required.

David Haug.    David will be returning from his honeymoon on Dec 4 and has 
expressed a strong interest in serving on the Bush team.
Woody Wodraska.  Woody would like to work on environmental and water issues 
and has been in touch with Bush campaign folks in both California and 
Florida.  He would appreciate a call on his behalf to Cheney.  Amanda is 
aware of his interest and is amenable to his service.
James Steffes.  You know Jim.  He is one of the most creative and talented 
people in my organization.  He is familiar with state and federal energy 
regulation as well as the state and federal policy makers who have played an 
active role in deregulation efforts.  He would be great to have on a vetting 
team for commission nominees.  I have talked to Jim and he is interested.
Others.  We can make another 4 people available from the government affairs 
organization with qualifications in energy, communications and market 
regulation.  The question is more a matter of how many Enron people they 
would like to have.  Among them:  Dan Allegretti (who will be chair of NEPOOL 
next year) who campaigned for Bush in New Hampshire; and Sue Landwehr, a 
republican who works for us in the upper midwest.


Linda Robertson has suggested that we try to put as many people on the 
"vetting" team as possible.  Let me know how I need to proceed.

Dear Mr. Kean:

Thank you for your call.  I am looking forward to working for you.  I will
be available as of June 1, 2001.

I will have the writing samples and resume ready for you on Monday, March 1,
2001.  Should I fax it to you?  Also, my dissertation is quite lengthy.
Would you like for me to forward you one chapter or just a couple pages?

As discussed, I will be available to come down to Houston between March 30
and April 6, 2001.  More snow (as in 6 inches) is expected today and
tomorrow.  I'm only 5'6".  Pretty soon I will be buried in it since it's
snow upon snow.  HELP!!

I look forward to seeing you again.

Regards,

Amy

I left Hartsoe a voicemail on this issue too.  I'm not sure we can convince 
Massey and others not to cap the secondary market for example, but they need 
to understand the facts before they run off attacking the pipelines:

gas utilities in California opposed interstate capacity expansions into the 
state.
gas utilities had just as much opportunity as anyone else to participate in 
open seasons for capacity.
gas utilities fialed to fill storage.
gas utilites have failed to build adequate take away capacity at the Cal 
border
I suspect Socal gas is using its interstate capacity and its in state storage 
to line its own pockets.
In short, if FERC wants to get to the bottom of the problem they need to look 
in California, not outside.

Subject: House and Senate Energy Hearings Today on California/Western 
Electric Situation

Steve, I've been thinking about the intense preoccupation with gas prices 
lately and decided to pass this info along because I think it's a red flag.  
My concern is that there might not only be a backlash affecting our 
interstate pipelines, but that our gas marketing efforts might be adversely 
affected.  It might well be found that the holders of the firm capacity (i.e. 
marketers?), and not the pipes themselves, are at "fault" for the large basis 
differentials between the basins and the CA delivery points.  Whoever is 
blamed might not really matter.  My gut feeling is that the other shoe is 
about to drop, with calls for price caps on gas commodity prices into the 
West.  This, of course, could affect years of effort on the gas marketing 
side in establishing competitive markets.  Pipeline open access is of no 
avail if there is government intervention in the gas markets.  Commissioner 
Massey, Senator Feinstein and other Western Senators were saying some very 
concerning things about gas prices, the impacts in their states and that 
something needed to be done.  FERC responded with an announcement of their 
technical conference on interstate pipeline capacity  and intrastate take 
away capacity (which, by the way, doesn't appear to address storage).  
Everyone wants an explanation as to why the basis differential is much higher 
than in other states, since they thought it should only consist of transport 
costs.  Ray

Subject: House and Senate Energy Hearings Today on California/Western 
Electric Situation

I was at the Senate hearing today on FERC's market Monitoring and Mitigation 
order, and I would add only a few additional and interesting 
regulatory-related details to John's fine summary:

The hearing was contentious- among the Senators themselves, among the FERC 
Commissioners themselves, and the interchanges between them.

Gas prices were controversial.  Commissioner Massey kicked off the discussion 
on this issue citing a transport basis differential into CA of $10, when it 
was less than a dollar in other areas.  He then noted that the high gas cost 
would adversely affect the power price under the auction, and that FERC must 
act regarding the high transport differentials- "We will never get a handle 
on electric prices unless we get a handle on gas prices".  That opened the 
floodgates of discussion, culminating with the announcement by Commissioner 
Breathitt of FERC's technical conference (notice of which issued today) on 
the topic of current and projected interstate pipeline capacity, and adequacy 
of infrastructure within CA.  She said that this would shed light on basis 
differentials and gas prices.

Freudian slip?  Chairman Hebert was heard to say by various attendees that 
price mitigation in the WSCC would apply at all times (in contrast to the 
order, which proposes mitigation only during times when reserves reach/fall 
below 7%).  Whether he mis-spoke, or not, remains to be seen.  

Regarding the issue of how often mitigation would be invoked in CA (i.e., 
Stages 1, 2 or 3):
 Hebert opined "Most of the time".
 Breathitt said "Likely 80-85% of the time".
 Massey was unconvinced.

Several Senators railed at the Commission for "not doing its job" and 
threatened that if the Commission did not act, Congress would act.

If you have any questions or need additional detail, please feel free to 
call.  Ray

Subject: House and Senate Energy Hearings Today on California/Western 
Electric Situation

I attended both the House and Senate energy committee hearings today.  House 
hearing was in the Barton Subcommittee (Energy & Air Quality).  Senate 
hearing was on last week's FERC order on a "soft price cap" and related 
issues.  The House witnesses were dominated by California officials: Cal 
Energy Commission, Cal Air Resources Board, Chairman of Gov Davis Generation 
Implementation Task Force.  In addition, there were witnesses from the 
Western Area Power Admin and Bonneville PA.  The Senate witnesses were the 
three FERC commissioners.

HIghlights

Chairman Barton said it is still his intention to try to mark up the Barton 
bill, H.R. 1647 next week (many on and off the Subcommittee doubt this will 
happen; we are gathering political intelligence on those prospects and will 
report back with more information and conclusions once that is done); 
Chairman Barton also said he may go to California next week.
There was considerable emphasis at both hearings about the alleged role that 
higher natural gas prices into California play in the electric power rate 
increases; several witnesses focused on difference in alleged transportation 
costs for similar differences between California and non-CA states; FERC at 
the Senate hearing said that today the commission announced a staff technical 
conference for later this month on all aspects of the natural gas market as 
it relates to California; a House member from Southern Illinois coal country 
attacked California for using only natural gas in its new power plants.
The House witnesses, primarily BPA but also the California witnesses, 
attacked the negawatt provision in sec. 102 of the Barton bill; the criticism 
was that BPA would be forced to purchase power on the open market at a high 
price since it is short, sell it to the DSIs under contract; let the DSI sell 
it at market rates and capture the difference; BPA witness said that thus 
sec. 102 would make it difficult if not impossible to implement their 
strategy to avoid as much as a 200 percent rate increase on 10/1/01; BPA 
testimony will make it tough for Members of Congress from that service region 
to support sec. 102.
Both hearings also touched on how difficult it would be to actually devise a 
price cap; at the House hearing, none of those advocating a price cap among 
the witnesses could answer excellent questions about exactly how this could 
be done; the witnesses just said "cost plus a reasonable profit" and said 
leave the details to FERC; at afternoon Senate hearing, Chairman Hebert had 
the staff bring in 15 boxes from one FP&L case to show how a price cap would 
take too long to bring any relief to California this summer; he said last 
week's soft price cap is much better.
Also on the price cap, Rep. Walden (R-OR)  got the Cal Energy Comm chair to 
admit that if the price caps had been in place earlier, California would NOT 
have taken the conservation and new generation steps that it has taken 
recently. 
The interplay among the FERC commissioners was much more contentious than it 
was a House hearing on Tuesday, although it could have been worse; when 
Senate Chairman Murkowski (R-AK) said that "help is on the way" in the form 
of the nominees for the two vacancies, Sen. Dorgan (D-ND) made a comment that 
suggested that the confirmation process will not be smooth; the same concern 
came from the interplay among the Senators, which was also somewhat 
contentious at times.

Please advise if you have any questions or would like further details.

The California Chamber of Commerce received a call from someone at the
CPUC who requested that they send as many customers as possible to
testify at Tuesday's hearing in favor of direct access.   The Chamber
has requested the same thing of Enron.

the price might be a bit stiff, particularly in light of the following: I 
don't think we need the DC grass tops component.  we have an effective set of 
messages, contacts, consultants and lawyers.  Perhaps we could use Charlie as 
a fresh set of eyes on that stuff, but I think that asking him to develop 
such an effort would be duplicative of what we have done with AAE, Paxson, 
Fleischman-Hillard, Divall, etc.

I do think the other aspects of what he proposes would be useful, however, 
(and should be less resource intensive and at least a little less costly).

Dear Mr. Metts,

Enron, being one of the extraordinary companies that has been able to
restructure the corporation in an effective way, and that still is under
important business transformation, is a subject of many interests. The
current challenges are keeping company's management busy. Being aware of
this I wanted to take liberty of asking, if it would be possible to get
someone of Enron's top executive to contribute Nokia's top executive
development program. We have invited a few external key note speakers to
elaborate their company's transformation. This kind of experience change has
proved to be beneficial for both parties. Also Nokia's experiences have been
valuable input in certain restructuring processes.

This program, called Panorama, is an annual top executive development
program, which takes about half a year in three modules. In every year we
have nominated 35 participants to this intensive action. The program target
is three folded, give input to company's strategy development, strengthen
and integrate common understanding of company's direction, and develop
leadership capacity. The program owner is Jorma Ollila, CEO of Nokia.

What are benefits from Enron's point of view in the case we are able to get
someone of Enron's executives in the program? I think that one of the most
important outcome of this kind of events is  to open a dynamic networking
and discussion forum between our executives. Both parties could capitalize
this cooperation.

In short, we would appreciate very much if we could have your company's
presentation in this Panorama forum.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Yours sincerely,

Juhani Hokkanen,
Senior Vice President, Human Resources Development
Nokia Group

Subject: good luck and Houston

Can any of you meet with Professor Littlechild on 23 April.  He has a small 
consulting services contract with me, to write on liberalisation of energy 
markets.  his current work is devoted to, among other thins, debunking 
Joskow, et al., on the argument that most of the benefits of liberalisation 
are cpatureed at the wholesale level, and he argues that a 
working/funcitoning retail market, and corresponding contracts market for 
risk management, is paramount to ultimate success (very Enron).  He comes 
across very much as an academic (Jeff Dasovich heard him speak on this 
subject in San Francisco, and he has spoken in Tokyo), and very Staid 
British, but he was electricity regulator in UK for 9 years, and is 
indisputably a top academic, so he carries some status when he speaks.  i 
would hope that all 3 of you could make some time with him, and any toerhs 
you could think of.  Your response/thoughts?   thanks  mcs

Dear Mark
?
I was just talking to Kyran, who mentioned your  impending move back to 
Houston. I shall be disappointed to see you go, but  congratulate you and 
wish you well.? Two things.
1. Any further thoughts on the work we began to  talk about,and envisaged in 
the contract? Or shall I wait to hear from your  successor?
2. We spoke some time ago about a possible visit to  Houston. I shall be in 
DC on Friday 20 April and Austin on weekend of 21/22  April. I thought of 
visiting on Monday 23 April if that would be convenient and  if relevant 
people would be available. My main interest would be Enron thinking  on US 
developments such as retail, California, trading, Pools versus bilateral  
markets, capacity auctions etc. Also Enron global strategy in other  
countries.
?
I gather you're off on holiday now. Enjoy the last  dose of British weather - 
if you 
can.
?
Best wishes
Stephen

Attached is a brief overview of the EGM business (I realize you probably 
already have this, Lisa).  This organization represents perhaps the biggest 
near term earnings growth opportunity we have as a company and one that will 
require our organization to develop expertise in new markets, new regualtory 
fora, and perhaps new countries.  From time to time, I'm sure we will all be 
called on to help out, so I'll endeavor to pass on any info I receive.

Steve,

Attached, for your information, is  a copy of a general presentation that I 
prepared to illustrate and describe EGM's businesses.  This is a presentation 
that will become a "living" document to communicate our businesses and 
growth.  I will be making numerous changes as we move closer to the analyst 
meeting in January but I wanted to give everyone a copy of this version.

Please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions or comments.

served as guest host on the evening
European news roundup broadcast from CNBC's London studios.

Bill, we hit a home run this morning with HCAD.  They have agreed to take my 
reduced valuation on the Enron fleet.  A reduction of  $16,079,000 in taxable 
value.  This results in savings of $482,375.  That's not all, our allocation 
based on records for operations outside of the state of Texas resulted in 
additional savings of $1,559,638. Total savings to our 2000 budget will be 
$2,042,013.

		 Subject: Re: Envera Release

Steve,

Actually, EOL and other units of Enron have declined to participate and 
specifically asked not to be included in the press release.  Confidentially, 
this is a case of a developer overselling use of the Enron name for 
approximately $5 million equity stake.  We have caught him in many half 
truths and are uncomfortable going too far with this since we might get be 
placed in an awkward position.  Because of EOL and our own concerns, we 
intentionally toned it down.  I believe, in fact, that it is just another 
platform as well as an investment.  Consequently, we would prefer to keep 
this to the minimum of allowing them to issue a press release as included in 
the contract.  Your concurrence would be appreciated.  I am available, if you 
wish to discuss this further.

John

Looks fine as far as it goes ... but don't we want to explain how this fits 
in to our strategy?  Is it just another platform for us to bring our products 
and prices to the market?  We have said with respect to EOL that the 
transaction is the goal not the platform.  Do we want to position this the 
same way?  Examples of other press releases include our extension of pricing 
on EOL to the two other platforms (including Houston Street) which we did a 
couple of months ago.

Enron Global Markets (EGM) has entered into a cooperative agreement with

of this agreement  EGM will receive an equity interest in Envera.  The 
contract allows Envera to issue a press release, subject to our approval.  
Attached for your review and comment is the proposed release.  This release 
has been heavily scrubbed.  It is significantly less exposure than in their 
initial proposals.  Your early approval would be appreciated.

		 Subject: Request for Economist

Steve Kean asked that I respond to your voice mail message to him regarding 
your solicitation of government economists for your proposed May customer 
conference.  Let me suggest the following, each of whom has different 
attributes:

1.  David Wilcox, Asst. Sec of Economic Policy of Treasury, soon to rejoin 
the Federal Reserve.   David is an excellent macro economist but is not a 
"big name."
2.  Ted Truman, Asst. Sec of International Affairs, Treasury.  Ted is about 
join a think tank.  Before his stint at Treasury, Ted served 26 years at the 
Federal Reserve, many of which he served as Greenspan's right hand on 
international currency issues.  Ted has quarterbacked about every 
international currency intervention conducted by the United States over the 
last three decades.  
3.  Larry Summers, Secretary.   Larry will be joining a think tank for a few 
weeks.  He may or may not be available.  If the topic is of interest to him, 
he is agreeable to travel and speaking engagements.  
 
This is just my initial cut at some suggestions.  Once we know the Bush team, 
we may want to explore possible candidates from their ranks, although 
government ethics rules may prohibit us from paying for their travel to a 
"customer conference."  Government officials can accept travel from 
50l(c)(3)s, as a general rule.

John Stokes. Laird Smith and I spoke with Eric Schneidewind this afternoon.  
Varnum is currently representing the city on isolated matters.  Varnum is 
approaching the city attorney to obtain a waiver of any conflict of interest 
so that they may engage in lobbying activities on Azurix's behalf.  Eric is 
very confident that the city attorney will issue with waiver.  Varnum made it 
clear that should Azurix lose the contract and wish to engage in any legal 
action against the city, then Azurix would not be able to use Varnum b/c of 
their existing relationship with the city.  John assured Eric that it is 
extremely unlikely that Azuriz would ever pursue legal action against the 
city.

John Stokes has asked that Varnum deal directly with Tom Maxwell in the 
Edmonton office once the waiver is obtained.

They will keep us posted on progress.

Subject: Azurix, Grand Rapids contract  

I have spoken with Eric Schneidewind our attorney at Varnum, Riddering, 
Schmidt and Howlett in Lansing.  He is contacting other attorneys in the firm 
to follow up on this immediately.  Varnum is one of the two major west 
Michigan law firms and is based in Grand Rapids.  

John Stokes and I have spoken.  As soon as I learn anything from our 
attorneys, I will be in contact with him.

I also have a call into our lobbying firm, Karoub Associates.  I doubt that 
they could be more effective than Varnum on this one, but I want them in the 
loop b/c they might have some pull with key officials in Grand Rapids.

I will keep you posted.

Once again, I come to you for help.  We were awarded a biosolids dewatering 
contract in Grand Rapids, Michigan about a month ago.  We had bid against the 
incumbent, a company called Synagro.  You may recall that Azurix is in 
litigation with Syangro over a busted acquisition, but the two events are not 
related.  In any case, we were low bidder, and the recommendation was made to 
award the contract to us.  Synagro has been working to get the award 
overturned, and appears to have been successful.  It is not yet clear whether 
they are going to award the deal to Synagro, or re-bid.  It is not even clear 
what the grounds are for overturning the award, which indicates that it may 
be pure politics.  

Do we have any good political consultants that could help us in Grand 
Rapids?  We do not have much of a presence in that area, and were responding 
to a publicly advertised bid.  Price and technical qualifications were the 
only issues.  Politics did not enter into it until now, so we were caught a 
little flat-footed.   

Any suggestions?

No charges.  I think we should refer these to Carrie Robert and ask her to 
run down the people in the organization most likely to have an interest.  In 
this case, I would get in touch with Andy Fastow, Ben Glissan or someone in 
the finance group in London.  That way, we can make a better determination 
about the value of the relationship, make sure those who are interested in 
pitching them on doing bus. with Enron can be involved. Or, we can make a 
determination to decline.  I think we decide who we want to let in then do it 
for free, rather than charging.

I just spoke with Clark Smith, head of Elpaso's merchant arm.  I told him 
that we had been hearing that El Paso was blaming Enrononline for problems in 
Western gas markets.  He asked for some more specifics about who exactly was 
spreading the rumor (I told him we had heard it from 3-4 sources).  He 
acknowledged that EOL was not the problem; said he couldn't believe that it 
had been identified as such; and said he would bring it up on his call with 
his Washington team this afternoon.

I think he will put it to rest (except for whatever damage has already been 
done).  I did promise to get some more specifics on who has told us that El 
Paso pointed to us.  Can anybody give some info on that?

This is a thorough and helpful analysis.  But, have we considered the broader 
emergency powers the president might have (i.e. beyond the clean air act 
waivers requested by a governor)?  It would seem that the importance of the 
defense business in California, the large number of military facilities, the 
public safety hazards of widespread blackouts, etc. ought to trigger some 
broader authority.

Here's a first draft of the emergency powers memo Sarah put together with 
V&E.  We are still awaiting one more section on the Federal Reserve's 
authority.  As you will note, there is remarkable authority vested in the 
President, including eminent domain.  Please note page 7, which read in 
combination with footnote #4 gives wide authority to the Federal government.  
Let's decide soon how we want to use this memo.  Thanks.

Dear Peter,

We are very happy with your suggestion and we would like to propose that the
presentation also includes the interactions between power and gas trading
and access to networks, since the conference is about the convergence of
these two sectors.

We would be very greatful if you could identify the speaker and the title of
the presentation during the following days so that this can be included in
the programme as soon as possible and go for final printing.

What do you think about a title like?: Trading of gas and electricity and
access to networks : what does the California experience learn us?

Best regards and thank you agan.

Ana

Reverting to you after some delay, Ana, I confirm our willingness to
provide a senior speaker. We may be able to secure a Houston-based
corporate executive level Managing Director if you can give us the latitude
to introduce the subject of experiences in California and lessons for the
European power markets. This would still be a trading and wholesale
perspective, and indeed the lessons relate partly to issues of power
imports and exports across state boundaries. What do you think?
Regards,
          Peter.

Subject: FW: Request for PR2 Access

Steve -- For your approval.  As some additional information regarding the 
request, Kathy, Diane Taylor and I met with Deana Taylor this afternoon to 
understand what each person's role was and the specific access needed.  For 
the interim, we are recommending that the HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP and 
View Payroll and Time ENTP role be granted to each of the individuals listed 
below.  Until January 1, this function was performed in the Payroll 
Department and at that time was transitioned to Karen and Deana's group.  The 
people listed below actually transferred from the Payroll Department.  For 
the long term, we are going to look at creating a specific role for this 
group that would let them access only those data elements needed.

I've spoken with Mary Joyce by phone and she has approved, so I am requesting 
your approval as well.  These people have basically been prevented from being 
able to reconcile any of the net pay accounts, etc.  for the past week.

Please let me know if you will approve or if you need any additional 
information.
Thanks.
Jo Ann

Subject: Request for PR2 Access

Jo Ann,
As we discussed I am sending this email to request PR2 Enterprise access 
re-activated for the following employees:
  
   Karen Choyce               HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP
   Deana Taylor                HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP
   Joanne Cortez              HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP     (starting in 
the group 7/16)
   Rebecca Tran               HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP   &   View 
Payroll and Time
   Roy Comeaux              HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP   &   View Payroll 
and Time
   George Howell              HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP   &   View 
Payroll and Time  

Please note I am not requesting access for the entire department,  the list 
of employees above are the only individuals in our group that will be allowed 
this type of access. Corp's payroll accounting group is responsible for 
reconciling the general ledger balance sheet accounts across all Enron 
companies, therefore Enterprise access is needed.

The requested access is essential for our group to perform our job.   Without 
this, we are unable to trace amounts related to FIT, FICA, net pay, stock 
option deductions, etc,  through the payroll system to the ledger, and to 
ensure that the items are accounted for properly.   Equally as important,  
the access enables us to identify system issues between PR2 (payroll) and PR1 
(ledger).   Corp's payroll accounting group has already identified several 
processing issues and alerted the ISC.   

I hope this "pleads our case" on why we need the access and request it be 
re-activated.    Please feel free to call me or Mark Lindsey, if you need 
additional information. 

Thanks,
Deana

PLEASE E-MAIL ALL BILLING ISSUES TO "CLIFFORD.JACKSON@ENRON.COM" OR TO THE 
SPECIFIC SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM(S) AS DETAILED BELOW:       Year 2000 changes:
Phone charges:  Phones are being charged to the person's company and cost 
center where possible, otherwise to the rent location.  The description will 
start with People\ or Room\ unless it was entered manually at the source.

Data connections:  One connection is being charged for each room instead of 
one connection for each port in a room.

Attached  are spreadsheets with the detail supporting the expenses for all 
the various services provided by Enron Information Services. 

EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, 
and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&T 
calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in 
EB, 2AC, 3AC, or JF.  For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by 
Tammy Anderson for this purpose.  

People-specific services are billed to the company and cost center 
corresponding to the employee's SAP company and department. Video conference 
usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings are based on 
a company and cost center furnished by the resource using the service.

EIS bills services on a one month lag.  We take a snapshot of the Corporate 
Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha 
phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the SAP company and cost center 
for each employee.  This snapshot is taken about the 21st of each month for 
use as a source for billing information.  

Please examine these billings for accuracy.  If the billings are incorrect, 
generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting 
Corporate Administrative Services or the person should be moved to the 
correct SAP department by contacting the HR representative.  If the room 
number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, this may be 
corrected by sending the room number along with the telephone number to Notes 
Mail ID "Move-Team".

PLEASE E-MAIL ALL BILLING ISSUES TO "CLIFFORD.JACKSON@ENRON.COM" OR TO THE 
SPECIFIC SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM(S) AS DETAILED BELOW:       Year 2000 changes:
Phone charges:  Phones are being charged to the person's company and cost 
center where possible, otherwise to the rent location.  The description will 
start with People\ or Room\ unless it was entered manually at the source.

Data connections:  One connection is being charged for each room instead of 
one connection for each port in a room.

Attached  are spreadsheets with the detail supporting the expenses for all 
the various services provided by Enron Information Services. 

EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, 
and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&T 
calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in 
EB, 2AC, 3AC, or JF.  For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by 
Tammy Anderson for this purpose.  

People-specific services are billed to the company and cost center 
corresponding to the employee's SAP company and department. Video conference 
usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings are based on 
a company and cost center furnished by the resource using the service.

EIS bills services on a one month lag.  We take a snapshot of the Corporate 
Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha 
phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the SAP company and cost center 
for each employee.  This snapshot is taken about the 21st of each month for 
use as a source for billing information.  

Please examine these billings for accuracy.  If the billings are incorrect, 
generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting 
Corporate Administrative Services or the person should be moved to the 
correct SAP department by contacting the HR representative.  If the room 
number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, this may be 
corrected by sending the room number along with the telephone number to Notes 
Mail ID "Move-Team".

Shelly just called with some updated (and revised) information:

The location of the threat was our Loop Central Office, 4828 Loop Central 
Drive, suite 620.  It's an office building, and we have about 50 IT and 
software engineers in that office.  There is no signage identifying Enron on 
the building or on the suite.  One of our employees in the office received 
the call.  The police responded, evacuated and searched the building but did 
not find anything.  All employees have returned to the building.  Ch. 13 was 
at the site briefly.

Having worked on the Enron Advisory council process, I have one observation:  
consider having some or all of these individuals as "guest speakers" rather 
than formal memebers.  You can still have them review information, do their 
homework, and tailor their remarks to Enron specifics.
Also, you should definitely include Paul Portney at Resources for the 
Future.  He sits on the Enron Advisory Council and knows the company well.

		 Subject: External Advisory Council

As we discussed at the last Corporate Responsibility task force meeting, one 
activity that we have underway is recruiting an external advisory council.  
This council will be comprised of global experts on environmental and social 
issues, from non-governmental organizations and potentially other businesses, 
to advise us on trends and issues in this area.  An outline of the advisory 
council structure, along with categories of experts and proposed names is 
attached below.

We expect to convene meetings with this group twice a year, inviting the 
Enron executive committee and board of directors, as well as the Corporate 
Responsibility task force, to engage in a dialogue.  We plan to present a 
slate of possible candidates to Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling later this month, 
and would appreciate your input and any ideas by March 16.

Thanks for your consideration.

I am very interested in pursuing this and I believe Enron presents an ideal 
case study for the purposes you outlined.  I am copying Christie Patrick on

		 Subject: Possible Harvard Business School event

Steve,

Wanted to thank you again for reviewing the strategy as simple rules 
article.  It is forthcoming in the next Harvard Business Review and will send 
you some reprints once the magazine hits the newsstands. 

Also wanted to gauge your interest in a possible even at the Harvard Business 
School in April 2001.  We are currently finalizing our plans for the 
Entrepreneurial Manager--a first year course on entrepreneurship taken by all 
1,000 of our MBA students.  As part of the course, we will feature an 
entrepreneurial company as the capstone class in the course.  Last year we 
featured Intuit, taught an Intuit case study and hosted Scott Cook who spoke 
to the entire MBA class.  The session was a huge success--the highest rated 
class in our course and had a lasting impact on how our students think about 
entrepeneurship.  We were wondering whether you and your colleagues might be 
interested in being our featured company this year.  

If you decided to proceed, we would first write a case study focused on the 
process of creating new ventures within Enron.    The case would probably 
consist of three portions:  an overview of the Enron corporation, an in-depth 
description of one or two ventures successfully formed in the past, and a 
profile of someone currently attempting to start a new venture within 
Enron.   In preparing the case, we would draw heavily on existing case 
studies, articles, and book chapters profiling Enron to avoid duplicating 
effort.   We would then supplement our desk research by interviewing 
approximately 15-20 Enron employees, including top management team members 
(especially Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling), some folks involved in past ventures, 
and the people currently attempting to start a new venture.  Each interview 
would take approximately 60 minutes.  We could probably complete the bulk of 
the interviews in a two to three day visit to Enron, supplemented by 
telephone interviews.  The ideal timing for these interviews from our 
perspective would be the last week of November or the first few weeks of 
December.  We would then return to Boston, write a draft of the case and then 
submit that to you for review and clearance in January.  We could then make 
any last minute changes before distributing the case to the students for the 
April discussion.  

In addition to writing the case study, we would like to invite a group of 
Enron executives to HBS when we discuss the case in April.    The ideal date 
would be the 27th of April, but we could schedule the Enron day the 23rd, 
24th or 25th if the 27th were impossible for you.  Last year Intuit sent 
along six folks--some junior, some senior--each of whom sat in at least one 
of our class discussions.  In addition, Scott Cook spoke to the entire MBA 
class.  We would like to follow the same format this year, so it would be 
super if either Jeff or Ken (or in the best of all worlds, both!) could speak 
to the MBAs as a whole.  With Intuit last year, we kicked off at about 8:30 
and wrapped everything up by approximately 1:00.  We would shoot for roughly 
similar timing this year.  

Many of our students equate entrepreneurship with start-ups, and this day is 
designed to show them that it is possible (although extremely difficult) for 
large companies to be entrepreneurial.  As such, you and your colleagues 
would be providing an invaluable service to our students, and we would be 
deeply grateful for your contribution.  The event might also have some direct 
benefits to Enron in terms of increased profile among our students.  If you 
were interested, we could also explore opportunities to leverage this event 
to further increase Enron's profile as a leader of the New Economy.  We 
might, for instance, bundle the case study with a teaching note and edited 
video as a module on "entrepreneurship in large companies" and distribute it 
to other business schools through Harvard Business School press.  My 
colleagues and I would be most grateful for your cooperation and would be 
happy to explore ways that you might increase your return on the time 
invested.  

Please let me know if this opportunity might be of interest to you and your 
colleagues and how you would like to proceed.  I very much look forward to 
hearing from you.

		 Subject: Fellow referred to me by Ken Lay

Just got a call from a fellow named Jame Edgerly at the Enterprise Zone, 
Inc.  He told me that Ken Lay (through Ken's secretary Vanessa) referred me 
to him.  He is very interested in getting us to help him work with the 
Legislature to establish an "Enterprise Zone" energy tariff to encourage 
investment in California's Enterprice Zones.  Before I launch on the effort, 
just wanted to check in and see if this rings a bell with you.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

Steve:

At this point, our IT contacts are backpedalling a bit and suggesting they 
can overcome the TIBCO and Terminal Server problems.  There are still four 
important issues, however:

IT still cannot commit to transferring messages across domains.  This means 
that messages initiated at Corp and intended for the entire Enron 
organization will not reach any business units outside the Corp domain.
No messages will reach the EES organization unless IBM agrees not to use 
their proprietary message delivery tool, WebSphere, and will use WebLogic 
instead.  WebLogic is required by BackWeb, although it is designed by a 
separate company.
HR, intended to be a key user of this tool, will not use BackWeb because 
survey responses cannot be made anonymous.  HR has already purchased a tool 
called CONFIRMIT that can execute anonymous surveys.
Messages will not be delivered simultaneously to all users in the same 
domain, nor will they be delivered for two to five hours after they are sent 
by the message administrator.

Another thing to consider is that these messages will be set to expire and 
disappear within a set period of time, meaning users cannot retrieve them and 
read them later (as they can with e-mail).  This means that I could be away 
from the office for several days and miss a message entirely, because it 
would have expired and disappeared by the time I returned.

The plain fact is that a few members of IT are pushing this initiative, but 
they lack commercial sponsorship.  They are hoping Corp will foot the bill 
for a pilot which will allow them to fully test this tool before implementing 
it company-wide.

Please let us know if you have additional questions.

Do we have a sense for how many we can reach, how many we can't and where 
they are?  Are whole offices (eg Tokyo) unreachable or is it only those who 
have home offices?

Erin Rice and I would like to meet with you to discuss the issues concerning 
BackWeb before we proceed.  As you can see from the Design Document, they are 
pretty significant.

 It is critical to our nation's energy future  to achieve robust competition 
in wholesale power markets in order to ensure that electricity can move most  
effectively from where it is produced to where it is most needed. To that 
end, this Administration will strongly encourage the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission( FERC)  to actively exercise jurisdiction over all 
aspects of electricity transmission in interstate commerce and place all uses 
of the grid under the same rates, terms, and conditions.  This jurisdiction 
must also be extended by Congress to cover non-FERC jurisdictional power 
authorities.

Steve and Cindy,

Attached is the electronic "Save the Date" memo for the Management 
Conference.  We are preparing to send it out next week.  Please let me know 
if you have any comments or concerns on the e-mail.  

As for distribution, we've worked with HR on the distribution list for VPs; 
but will circle back with David Oxley's team to ensure we have the most 
up-to-date list.  Since some VPs in redeployment will most likely find 
positions within Enron by November, I don't plan to exclude them from the 
distribution ... unlike United Way, where we are not soliciting employees in 
redeployment for a contribution.

I look forward to any feedback.

My comments are attached.  I think the pleading is well written, but, as 
you'll see from my comments, I believe we should be incorporating more of the 
arguments from the previous pleading.

Subject: Comments on Judge Wagner's Proposed Recommendation  

As you may be aware, the Chief Judge informed the parties to the settlement 
proceeding this afternoon that he intends to recommend to the Commission that 
it employ the June 19 rate methodology for the refund period from October 2 
forward.

Attached are draft comments that Sarah Novosel and I propose to submit to the 
Judge and his legal staff tomorrow.  While we would like to convince the 
Judge that the June 19 methodology is not appropriate, we also provide a 
fallback approach.

Please review the comments (they are only 4 pages) and send your comments to 
us.  We plan to submit the comments tomorrow.

Thanks

Ray and Sarah

I need you to run these items by Rick.  I take full responsibility for 
approving the hiring of the Hills firm (and I look forward to meeting with 
you and Carla as we discussed), but remain hopeful we can use their services 
for something other than WTO.  In the wake of Seattle, and as I have come to 
understand better what the WTO can and cannot do for us on the energy 
services front, I have come to the view that our talent and money would be 
better spent on other activities.  My inclination is to do the bare minimum 
necessary to keep the machine going.  If we have specifically committed to 
certain things, then let's follow through.  If there are things we can avoid, 
let's avoid them.  Specifically with respect to Fischer going to Geneva, Why 
not have him available by phone at all hours to provide assistance and mage 
that known to USG instead of underwriting additional travel.  With respect to 
the Hills firm, can we use the retained time to help with the specific 
strategies we are now working out for the regions?  These are the kinds of 
things we need to consider.

Subject: Enron and the Energy Services Issue Before The WTO

Steve: This is a brief extension of our conversation yesterday afternoon 
putting in print some of the upcoming dates and possible committments for 
your consideration and decision.

We have no exit strategy at this time and in order to follow your general 
instructions to withdraw gradually (I'm not quite certain that is possible at 
this stage) you need to know the following.

The April meeting at the WTO in Geneva (Committee on Specific Committments) 
spent considerable time discussing how energy services would be considered in 
the WTO GATS (General Agreement on Trade and Services) . The USTR raised the 
issue, tabled the issue and guided the discussion. We did not send anyone to 
that session.

As planned for several months, we issued the Rachel Thompson study which is 
completing its basic distribution now. There has already been considerable 
interest in the study and I fully expect it to generate discussion in the 
days ahead. I have sent you the correspondence from the Japanese Ministry. 
Tonight I am hosting a small dinner for the top staff person for the leading 
Japanese business organization affiliated with the CSI organization. He 
raised the issue of Japan's industry feeling energy services was going too 
fast too soon when Ken addressed the WTO Ministerial Forum last December in 
Seattle. Now he has told Bob Vastine, president of CSI that he was told later 
by his collegues that his statement was a misstatement. We'll hear more 
tonight.

Later today, the ESC Executive Committee is meeting with the DOE to discuss 
how they can support energy services for the USTR who has lacked technical 
advisers since Donna Bobbich and Russ Profozich left DOE earlier this year. 
DOE has appointed a group to help USTR and this is an orientation meeting 
held at their request.

Next week I have scheduled the first ESC full meeting since January to update 
members (now 50 since Schlumberger joined on Friday) on developments which is 
essentially a report by USTR Carol Balassa who is the responsible official 
handling energy services.

She has given a couple of us a debriefing on what happened at the WTO meeting 
and a request to prepare more detailed information for the May 10 meeting in 
Geneva where she tells us that energy services will be even more involved in 
the discussion. We should have Bob Fisher go to that meeting to be of 
assistance. This is a decision point for you.

We have made some other committments which are also decision points although 
the Helsinki meeting on June 18th has been agreed upon based on my feelings 
that when I discussed it (the SCO/FSN Showcase Europe) in Houston with you 
and Rick, you raised no objection which I took as agreeing that it should go 
forward.  We have done this meeting annually where I have brought in someone 
from Enron companies to brief them and host them for dinner. These are the 
commercial people in the US embassies throughout Europe and the former Soviet 
Union. They are important points of contact for our commercial people.  This 
year they want to have energy services in the WTO and as we would like them 
to exist in their territory. A few members of the ESC Executive Committee 
will do the former and Peter Styles the later. I have organized the dinner.

Following that meeting is one that EC Trade staffer Uta Klinkers wants the 
ESC Executive Committee to put on in Brussels which is a joint meeting she is 
organizing with European energy industry representatives. This is a dialogue 
on energy services. The EU is an important player in the WTO and Uta, who 
recently met with the ESC Executive Committee in Washington is quite 
supportive of liberalized energy services. At the EC she reports directly to 
Commissioner Pascal Lamy. Rick's memo this week suggested we have Peter 
Styles do this briefing. Peter is not an American and is not affiliated with 
the ESC. Therefore, unless we participate, Europe's energy industry is not 
talking with US industry. If this is what you want, then I should tell Uta 
that we are unable to do the meeting.

The last meeting is the presentation by Ken Lay at the OECD Forum 2000 on 
June 26 which I engineered with Doug Worth, Secretary General of the BIAC 
(Business Industry Affairs Committee) to the OECD. This is a major world 
conference and Ken is addressing e-commerce and services. Doug, an American 
and former head of the Washington IBM office wants to have Ken meet with OECD 
Commissioners in a smaller meeting to discuss trends for the future.  I had 
planned to be there with Ken for the day, day and a half he will be in Paris. 
I introduced our company to the OECD several years ago and it has become 
increasingly involved in issues of interest to us.

Well, these are the near-term items that require your fine hand if we are to 
proceed. A dramatic drop off at this time will have its effects and no one is 
likely to pick up our leadership. There is growing support for what has been 
accomplished and the USG plus others are now hooked on the energy services 
agenda. I cannot easily see an exit strategy that can do anything but cause 
criticism at this point. This is definately a longer term committment that I 
thought we had made when approval was given to hire the Hills firm. However, 
if you want to exit, other than pulling back from the Brussels meeting, I 
think the other meetings are firm committements at this point.

These are some thoughts for your consideration and decision.

Joe

I think it would be a good idea for them to talk, but I wouldn't want Jeff to 
go to California right now.  Maybe they could meet outside the state (if, for 
example, brown is going to be in DC or New York) or by phone.

Wanted you to be aware that Mayor Brown is inviting Jeff to meet with him, 
either in San Francisco or elsewhere.  Please advise, but I know that Jeff 
would probably not travel to California.

Mark Koenig and Andy Fastow will discuss meeting with Mayor Brown on the 
CalPERS issue.

Dear Mr. Skilling,

On behalf of Mayor Willie L. Brown, Jr. (San Francisco), it is my
pleasure to invite you to meet with him regarding energy issues in
California.

Mayor Brown wishes to meet with you in his capacity as a trustee of the
Board of Administration of the California Public Employees Retirement
System (CalPERS).  As you know, CalPERS is the largest public pension fund
in the
nation and is a sizeable investor in domestic energy stocks, bonds,
debentures, etc.  The Board has appointed Mayor Brown to lead a
delegation of trustees to meet with the CEOs of CalPERS' largest energy
holdings.  Enron represents one such holding.

The Mayor would be pleased to host you in his office at the newly
renovated City Hall in San Francisco or arrange an alternative location at
your earliest convenience.  I
will await your response.

Jeff Shankman (COO of Enron Global Markets) is interested in going and would 
like to see the schedule.  I told him you would send it to him.  Jeff can 
also help us get our message across on the problems in California's power 
markets (Dasovich can fill you in).  Also John ( Woody) Wodraska, managing 
director of Azurix is interested in attending.  Please get in touch with 
him.  I haven't heard from Stan yet.

Rick--just a reminder that I am not aware of anyone from the executive ranks 
that are interested in attending the democrat convention at this point.  I 
believe that you and Steve Kean had asked the question about both conventions 
to those folks, but I wanted to make sure that we had covered the bases.  
Stan Horton is the president of INGAA this year, and they are having an event 
on Sunday the 13th, but I have not been made aware of whether he will be 
attending and whether he would be interested in partcipating in any of 
Enron's other events.

I realize the group may go a different way with this, but I remain convinced 
that we should go to a pure number system (ie a pure relative ranking) and 
use the behaviors and skills descriptions as a way of discussing the 
differences between people.  Just adding the qualifier "relative to peers" 
glosses over what's really going on.  The behavior and skill descriptors tell 
everyone what is valued here and guide the discussion.  The relative ranking 
lets us have the flexibility to meet business needs by getting tighter or 
"looser" on performance rankings, terminations, and comp.

Steve, 

We have revised the PRC Cluster descriptors again, in an attempt to include 
"relativity" into the language.  Likewise,  for consistency we opted  not to 
change them too drastically at the year end.  Instead we will look at making 
other changes (for example, reducing the number of clusters from 6 to 5 
and/or changing the wording)  at the mid-year 2001.

The VP PRC Committee had a chance to look at the revised clusters at last 
week's meeting.  However, I apologize that I did not send them to you in 
advance of that meeting.  

Cindy has asked me to send them to the Executive Committee after you have had 
a chance to review them.  

Please let me know what you think.  

Thanks in advance,

Gina Corteselli

The rate case that the governmental affairs group filed in January, on behalf 
of Transredes, has come to a very successful conclusion and the new rates 
will go into effect towards the end of this month.  The rates are not much 
lower than what we filed for, and represent a very significant increase over 
the previous rates.  The tariff methodology and revised regulations, put into 
effect by the Supreme Decree, were followed to the letter by the regulator 
despite political pressure to arbitrarily keep rates down.  The deliverables 
here were to (1) obtain a tariff methodology via Supreme Decree that would 
make the company finance-able / rescue it from dire financial straits and (2) 
file a rate case and prosecute it to obtain hard rates in accordance with the 
tariff methodology.  This second deliverable has now been completed.  
Transredes has had a bond issue pending since last year due to the 
uncertainty about rates; it is my understanding that the financial market 
loved the ruling and that Transredes sold $40 million worth of bonds in about 
5 minutes!  This ruling should also significantly increase Transredes's 
market value, relative to Enron's efforts to sell its interest in the company.

     Existing Tariff SIRESE Approved % Increase TR/CLHB Proposed TR/CLHB % 
Increase

Gas Export (including surcharges)  $0.18  $0.2205  22.5%  $0.26 (excluding 
RG)  44.4%
Liquids Domestic    $1.05  $2.46  134.3%  $3.25    209.5%
Liquids Export     $1.55  $2.31  49%  $3.35    116.1%

CLHB's tariffs were also approved as follows $1.19  $2.20  84.9%  $3.528    
196.5%

As you can see we did substantially better than CLHB (comparable with our 
liquids domestic) !!

We will get a detailed report on the assumptions used by SIRESE to reach 
their conclusions on Monday, but our inteligence suggests the following :-

1. Export gas volumes increased to 100% TR capacity, and 100% GSA + Cuiaba 2 
assumed for SDA and TEMIN purposes
2. RG Compresion project deleted
3. Interest rate reduced to 10 or 10.5 % i.e. the rate in our bond issue
4. Liquids expansion in the South reduced
5. Some continuity of service CAPEX reduced
6. Unknown OPEX reduction and maybe a change to the OPEX allocation between 
concesions
7. OCC in service date slipped from 2003 to 2004.
8. Debt/Equity assumption changed from 60/40 to 70/30

Our strategy to respond to each of these points is as follows :-

1. Volumes.  Covered by 8% rule, we can blete but can expect little back 
here.  Clearly we will appeal if volumes exceed installed capacity in the 
short term i.e. 2002/2003.
2. RG Compression - not worth fighting for since we don't even have the 
support of BG
3. Interest Rate - We'll get this back when we do a tariff  revision and 
actual rates are used.  When we get the detail we will appeal if Jan feels we 
have concrete grounds i.e. commision costs etc. are omited.
4. Liquids Expansion in the South.  Here we intend to do a detailed analysis 
of exactly what has been deleted and as a result what liquids/gas production 
will be shut in.  If possible all assumptions to be agreed with the affected 
producers (PB, BG, Vintage and Chaco).  We will then write to those 
producers(copy SIRESE , VMEH etc.) stating that on their recommendation the 
project scope was reduced by SIRESE.  We will give them an estimate of the 
lost liquids/gas production (in both volume and cash terms) resultant from 
this decision.  We will tell them that since they proposed these reductions 
we have no intention of appealing them but invite them to appeal.
5. Continuity of Service Capex.  We need to see the detail here.  We will 
take the moral high ground and be absolutely clear that we are not prepared 
to compromise our safety and environmental standards.  We need to see exactly 
what has been removed, but my thought is that if that means we are unable to 
provide some services (e.g. LPG transportation) or the continued operation of 
some liquids laterals, we should write to those producers affected suggesting 
that if they wish these services to be continued they need to appeal the 
decision.  Again since this is Capex we will get it back in the end on tariff 
revisions as long as the expenditure is approved on an annual basis in the 
SIRESE budget process.
6. OPEX - need to see the detail on Monday.
7. OCC - will not appeal - we need to do a detailed study to develop an OCC 
strategy.
8. Debt/Equity ratio.  Strictly speaking what has been done is in accordance 
with the Law/Regulation - the regulation says the maximum allowed equity is 
40%.  However, we have very strong grounds to appeal since : a) we are 
currently miles away from 60/40 let alone 70/30, b) we can only borrow for 
CAPEX (as per bond issue and the policy of all/most banks/lending 
institutions) with the case presented in the rate case if we borrow to cover 
100% of CAPEX we can easily demonstrate that we are still miles away from 
60/40.  We intend to fight this one very hard using all the 
external/independant help we can get.

As you are all aware our big exposure with the rate case was that the much 
needed substantial increase in liquids tariffs would not be approved and we 
would be subjected to some form of arbitary cut.  This has not happened 
SIRESE has now approved and hence owns these substantial increases.  Having 
got the big hike our job is now to claw back as much as we can from the above 
strategy in the full knowledge that the results of these efforts will be much 
smaller and hence managable increases.

Attached is an analysis of the individual impacts on the tariff of the above 
points and the corporate model using the new tariff with our volume 
assumptions (i.e. the worst case).

Regards,
Doug

LaRence is running up against the deadline for associates to be promoted or 
move out.  Here is my concern: LaRence has been worked for a number of people 
who ended up leaving the company:  he worked for Dave Ramm at Enron Wind 
(Dave left).  He also worked for John Palmisano who also has left the 
company.  He ended up in a structuring group working for Brad Richter.  It's 
hard to sort out what happened there but perhaps because of LaRence's lack of 
interest in the area, which he apparently expressed to Brad, he has not done 
much structuring work and Brad is not inclined to promote him or keep him in 
the organization.  He has been told that he needs to find something now.

Could you guys look into this?  Perhaps we could either extend his deadline, 
or find him something through the redeployment process?

Need to met with you before May 8th, but would like to do it in the next 2 
weeks,  to discuss Enron's position on this NPC report.  I am currently 
coordinating with Andrew Parsons, Mark Holsworth etc.  Rob sent me a copy of

		 Subject: Draft NPC Report

Rob:

Thought I'd send you the latest draft of the report, it's 85-90%  final (the 
recommendations are 100%).

Questions the report raises for Enron:

Is Enron part of the oil & natural gas sector or the banking and finance 
sector?  Both are looking at information sharing mechanism to mitigate risks 
to IT systems.  The Banking & Finance sector has been operating an 
information sharing and analysis center (ISAC) for over a year.  Discussions 
with members of the banking and finance sector indicate it has value.  

If Enron is a part of the oil & natural gas sector, are we willing to take a 
leadership role and enter into a potential LLC with other Council member 
companies to form an ISAC for this sector? Cost to Enron would be based on 
number of individuals receiving alerts etc., however, it could be as low as 
$13K per year.  An additional cost would be to appoint an employee to the 
LLC's governance body to ensure Enron's needs were addressed.  Archie Dunham, 
CONOCO's Chairman, has agreed to champion this initiative if the Council 
recommends it at the 6 June  meeting.

Current coordination:

The legal issues have been worked by a sub-group lead by Tom Carmel, CONOCO.  
Mark Holsworth, Corp. Legal has been our representative.  Recent DOJ action 
regarding information sharing to mitigate IT risks seems to indicate that 
anti-trust will not be an issue.  Steptoe & Johnson, LLP have undertaken a 
review of the liability issues and suggested ways to mitigate them.

Mike Hicks and I have been working with Mark Thibodeaux, Corp. IT Compliance, 
and will be meeting with Steve Kean and others in the security and IT 
protection efforts in next two weeks. 

Recommendation:

Enron participate fully in the oil and natural gas sector's efforts - As 
Enron becomes more and more dependant on IT, having a mechanism that provides 
tailored vulnerability information and solutions in a "one-stop-shop" format 
is valuable and can lead to reduced insurance premiums.

Mintz/HOU/ECT
		 Subject: Tax Lobbying Initiative for Generation Finance Vehicle

Steve,

I'm sending this memo to you as a reminder of our one minute conversation in 
the garage last night.

Background
Going back almost three years, John Stinebaugh and I started looking for a 
more efficient method to finance generation projects.  We explored two 
avenues, creating a Master Limited Partnership ("MLP") or a Real Estate 
Investment Trust ("REIT") to own the projects (with Enron as a manager).  The 
advantages of a MLP or a REIT structure are twofold (i) they provide direct 
access to the public equity markets and (ii) they provide a lower cost of 
equity capital because earnings are taxed at the "equity holder" level, not 
at the MLP/REIT level, i.e., you do not have double taxation on earnings as 
with a publically held "C" corporation.  John and I pursued these avenues 
with Jordan Mintz because we wanted to create an off-balance sheet vehicle 
that would provide a lower overall cost of capital so that ENA could be more 
competitive in bidding for acquisitions.  The same vehicle would also have 
provided another exit vehicle for the peakers or other assets that ENA was 
developing at the time.

Jordan explored both MLP and REIT avenues.  The MLP was quickly disqualified 
because electric generation and transmission assets do not qualify as assets 
that can be financed using an MLP structure.  The REIT structure was more 
promising to the point where Jordan had prepared and submitted a request for 
a private letter ruling from the IRS allowing certain types of generating 
assets to be placed into REIT.  Unfortunately, the IRS ruled against our 
request.

Concept
There would still be real value to Enron in having the tax laws changed to 
allow generation and transmission assets to be placed into either a REIT or 
an MLP.  ENA holds economic interests in QF's in third party (non-utility) 
vehicles.  Being able to package these into an MLP/REIT would provide a good 
exit strategy for these and other investments we may acquire in the future.  
Other efforts, such as building/controlling transmission or 
purchasing/developing coal-fired generation projects would also benefit from 
access to cheaper equity capital.

The public policy benefit is pretty clear.  Avoiding double taxation of 
profits/dividends would lower the cost of equity capital invested in 
generation and transmission assets.  This in turn should have a beneficial 
effect on encouraging construction of new (and badly needed) generation and 
transmission assets by lowering the equity return that holders of these 
assets would require.  You could even take existing rate-regulated utility 
generation and transmission assets and lower rates by placing these assets 
into MLP's or REITS by eliminating the federal and state taxes that are 
factored into rates to give utilities their after-tax allowed rates of return.

Given the recent attention on California and de-regulation in general, 
creating more tax-efficient ownership vehicles for these assets could provide 
a way to lower costs without having states acquire these assets and gain 
financing advantages through tax-exempt bond issues.

Conclusion
Given the momentum that may be gathering for new tax legistlation, coupled 
with the growing concer over energy policy, it may be a good time to float 
this change in tax law.  It could reasonably be argued that it would assist 
in directing capital into increasing generation/transmission supply, one of 
the key issues for California.  Jordan can update you further on what we have 
done in the past and what would need to be changed in the tax laws.

Regards,

Mike J Miller

Rich, I am on a leave from LeBoeuf and working on the Transition Team as part

on electricity issues.  I regret the short notice and tight deadline for your 
response (Monday COB), but time is short and there is a need to flesh out 
Administration positions and prepare nominees.  Please consider responding to 
the questions as an attachment to your response, which should use the

I understand from Shelley that you are going to be seeing Commissioner 
Breathitt on Monday.  We have been working to persuade her to vote for 
forceful FERC action on electricity issues.  She is widely viewed as the 
swing vote (with Massey and Hoecker being the other two votes) needed for the 
Commission to take action.  Attached are two documents -- one is a set of 
talking points for you and the second is a FERC action plan that we are 
floating with several of the Commissioners.

Jeff Dasovich and I, along with several IEP members, met with Gov Davis'=20
staff today, including his Chief of Staff, his Staff Director and two polic=
y=20
advisors on energy issues.  They made the following points:

The Governor is personally spending a great deal of time on electricity=20
issues (and is forcing them to spend their time on it as well).
The Governor recognizes that part of the problem is a supply shortage, but=
=20
they put special emphasis on the view that in addition to supply shortfalls=
,=20
a big part of the problem is a "dysfunctional market" -- a thinly veiled=20
reference to price manipulation by people sitting in the room.
The Governor's view is that all participants (regulators, utilities,=20
customers and generators) must "behave responsibly".
Everyone must "share the pain".
The legislative battles are likely to start as soon as the legislature=20
returns next week, and the Governor will be putting forth several legislati=
ve=20
proposals in the next couple of weeks.
While staff went out of its way to say that the list of proposals (in the=
=20
attached e-mail) were unofficial and for discussion purposes only, it was=
=20
fairly clear that they defined much of what the governor plans to propose.

The meeting was not very encouraging nor did it provide much in the way of=
=20
new information.  The IEP group was on message, making the usual arguments=
=20
about the need for forward contracting, expedited generation and transmissi=
on=20
siting, a real retail market to promote demand side responses, etc.  The=20
staff is clearly focussed on forward contracting as part of the solution bu=
t=20
remains committed to the idea that generators have to cough up some money a=
nd=20
remain subject to rate caps, possible restrictions on sales outside the sta=
te=20
(at least at peak times), etc.  One approach they appear to be toying with =
is=20
a "share the pain" proposal which would have utilities absorbing some of th=
e=20
deferred costs and consumers absorbing some of the deferred costs in the fo=
rm=20
of higher rates.  That leaves generators ... who they might want to either=
=20
agree to some refunds or provide power at lower going-forward prices.

The staff says that they remain open to proposed solutions, but the Davis=
=20
administration appears unwilling to spend any political capital to fix the=
=20
problem. =20

I think we are in for a lengthy legislative and PUC fight.  We should, as=
=20
always, provide consistent and reasonable solutions.  I think we should=20
prepare a document for distribution to staff, legislators (and anyone else)=
=20
that takes the factual background and proposed solutions we have put forwar=
d=20
(eg in Belden's presentation and the Seabron Adamson whitepaper) and wraps=
=20
them in a more political context.  In other words, we have already=20
articulated the right answers; we now need to put a political rationale=20
around our proposals -- a set of arguments which responds directly to the=

political opposition those answers are likely to encounter.  Jeff will foll=

Subject: Your June 21 Trip

We have confirmed a meeting for you with Senator Feinstein.  In addition, we 
are presently trying to schedule you with Senators Lieberman, Landrieu, 
Hagel, Domenici, Johnson, and Cantwell.   You will be here at a very 
important time.  

In addition, Ken Lay is slated to be in New York on June 15.  We are trying 
to get appointments for him with Senator Schumer and Rep. Rangel.  If we are 
unsuccessful in lining up anything for him in NY, we have "penciled in" Ken 
on Chairman Bingaman's calendar for 10:30 am that day, here in DC.  Ken is in 
NY Thursday night for an award, and I understand is planning to be in NY 
Friday night, but his calendar at present is clear during the day.  If we 
don't get the Schumer appointment in NY, I will being asking you to see if 
Ken is willing to make a quick trip during the day on Friday to DC to see 
Bingaman and, if we can get him, Leader Daschle.  I think it would be worth a 
quick trip from NY and will still allow him to be in NY that night.

try to set up another policy committee meeting?  Jeff's schedule is pretty 
ugly for the rest of this month and early July, but could probably do 
something mid-July.  I'm not sure what Ken Lay's schedule looks like, 
though.  Please advise.  Thanks, SRS

Hi Steve, 
    Folks love Newsome, and I think he's very nice and appears to be very 
free market.  Spears, the other Republican appointee is not at all free 
market, in my view.  I would not like this to mentioned anywhere else, but I 
have found that the farm reps on the Commission may sound deregulatory but 
are not, and have been really troublesome without a good free market person 
on board.  And there are no truly free market persons on  board at the 
Commission (every single other agricultural rep that I worked with on the 
Commission were trouble, even though they claimed to be deregulatory -- and 
they were far worse before I got there and after I left.)  
    I visited with Newsome a day before Inauguration, and I was appalled at 
what they were planning to do concerning agency structure -- that would have 
elevated the regulatory lawyers and diminished the role of the economists at 
the agency.  Misguided and showed to me a lack of understanding of how 
organizational structures can affect what comes out of an agency.  
    I am often at odds with "the industry view" regarding CFTC issues.  I 
don't think the futures exchanges, who have a lot of power, necessarily are 
pro-competition; and many of the non-exchange folks who lobby on CFTC issues 
are Washington or New York (Democrat - which is why they want to involve Ken 
at this level) lawyers who do not understand markets and who are more 
interested in being able to claim influence or impact.  The CFTC is in awful 
shape -- the quality of staff is horrendous, and the Commission is relying on 
some of the worst people for their policy work (same folks that Brooksley 
Born used, same folks who have advocated more regulation of the OTC market 
for years).  Many quality folks do not want the job as Chairman because it's 
been such a backwater.  I am looking for some good folks.  Have  at least one 
person who would be good at that job.  And it's not Newsome.  Please do not 
share this information with the usual folks, as they hate me anyway (I'm too 
free market and have argued against their "fixes").  Sorry for this scathing 
review, but this is an important appointment.  Wendy

Humberto - I forwarded your resume to Barry Hunsaker who is general counsel 
at EOG Resources.  As you may know, EOG used to be Enron Oil and Gas, a 
majority-owned Enron subsidiary.  A couple of years ago, Enron sold its 
interest in EOG and it became a stand alone company.  EOG Resources has been 
doing very well.  I don't know if they are looking for lawyers now, but I 
think I sent your resume to the right place.

You need to be aware that we are in the process of selling the Wind Co.  Mark 
Metts and Amit Walya are working on this.  If the price changes under the QF 
contracts it would impact the sale.  Call Amit to discuss (345-5570).

		 Subject: IMPORTANT CONFERENCE CALL ON QF/SRAC MATTERS SCHEDULED FOR 12:30 
P.M. (NOONISH) ON SUNDAY, JAN.  21

An important conference call is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. (PST) on Sunday, 
Today, Jan 21 to discuss the status of legislative meetings on QF/SRAC 
matters.  
 
Call-In number is            888-422-7124
Particpant Code is          111756
 
 
Status Report
After a marathon 12 hour meeting with Assemplyman Keeley, Senator Battin, QF 
Parties, and SCE, a Keeley sponsored "deal" was proposed at 3:30 a.m. this 
morning.  The crux of the deal is as follows:
 
For renewables and non-gas fired QF, essentially ...
 
7.8 cents/kwh for delivered power for 5 years ["all in", i.e. includes 
capacity and energy]
1.0 on losses
no 'clawback' for wind resources which may have failed to meet fixed capacity 
obligations in the past
Applies "going forward" (presumedly Feb. 1)
 
 
For gas-fired QFs...
 
7.8 cents/kwh for five years, assuming gas is $5.60;  payment will 
increase/decrease tied to gas  (this assumes an IER of 9821)
1.0 on line losses
applies "going forward"
Caacity True-up and "forbearance" were not addressed.  Credit worthiness will 
be address in the technical conference scheduled for later today (Sunday).  
This program will require in part legislative blessing and direction, 
followed by CPUC approval of individual contract amendments.  This is 
essentially the PG&E/QF "deal" for the gas guys.  For the renewables, it is 
more of a fixed payment approach.
 
A "Technical Conference" is scheduled for Sunday (today) in Sacramento to 
work out some of the implementing details.

 In order to better align our resources with the business units we support, 
we are designating the following individuals as operating company leads with 
primary responsibility for designing and implementing government and 
regulatory affairs support for the operating companies and to serve as 
primary contacts for the operating companies:

  EBS: Scott Bolton & Donald Lassere

  EES: Harry Kingerski

  ENA: Jim Steffes

 In addition to supporting the operating company organizations, these 
individuals will report to Rick Shapiro.  Jim Steffes will retain his 
responsibilities for regulatory risk assessment and will continue to report 
to Steve Kean in that capacity.

 There are already numerous working relationships and points of contact 
between government affairs and the operating companies.  The designation of 
Scott, Donald, Harry and Jim as leads does not change that.  Rather, we are 
looking to these individuals to coordinate these activities and serve as a 
"go to" resource on issues which impact the respective operating companies.

Steve,

Linda will need to talk to you.  She has legitimate concerns that Enron 
should not be too eager to help Wyden on this issue as it could be turned 
against us.  already, the May 10th Energy Daily article states (incorrectly) 
that Wyden is mulling a bill that will require energy traders to release more 
market data.  I have already flagged for Wyden's office that this is not the 
intent of the bill and that if it is used to attack merketers that Enron 
would not support it.

Linda suggested that John Shelk and I meet with Wyden's office to get his 
commitment that any such amendments will be killed.  Are you in Japan?

A Trio of Little Guys
Embarks on Wild Ride
In Global Oil Market
---
Pursuing Business With DOE,
Their Paths Diverge; One
Leads to `a Lot of Money' 
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters John Fialka in Denver, Alexei 
Barrionuevo in Tallahassee, Fla., and Jonathan Weil in New York 
? 
10/16/2000 
The Wall Street Journal 
Page A1 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
Lance Stroud of New York, Renard D. Euell of Denver and Ronald Peek of 
Tallahassee, Fla., all had dreams of becoming oil barons. And on Oct. 4, when 
the Department of Energy announced the results of the bidding for oil from 
the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, they thought their ships had come 
in. 
Two of the three black entrepreneurs were unknowns in the industry, and none 
of them had ever done a major oil deal. But there they were, listed as 
winning bidders alongside some of the biggest names in the business -- 
Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., BP Amoco 
PLC and Amerada Hess Corp. Each would be given the right to withdraw millions 
of barrels of oil from the reserve amid one of the most volatile oil markets 
in decades. In exchange, each had offered to replace that oil, plus an 
additional amount akin to an interest payment, a year later. They and the 
other winning bidders, the Energy Department said, were picked soley because 
they pledged to return the biggest quantities of oil to the reserve. 
There was just one catch: In its rush to release the oil and so ease a price 
crunch, the Energy Department had suspended its usual requirement that each 
bidder supply financial guarantees. But it wanted the winning bidders to 
present letters of credit, equal to the oil's market value, five days after 
their bids were submitted. The big players could easily meet that 
requirement. But Messrs. Stroud, Euell and Peek were men of limited means. 
They needed to find someone willing to back them for tens of millions of 
dollars -- and fast. 
The drama made for an unaccustomed scene in Harlem, where the 35-year-old Mr. 
Stroud lived with his 74-year-old mother. A heavy-set man with a goatee, Mr. 
Stroud, a former Army enlisted man who had dropped out of college shy of 
graduation, had held a string of odd jobs while using the Internet to seek 
out a big business deal. 
The aspiring oil man had entered his bid for four million barrels from the 
reserve, via the Internet. He won't discuss the details of his bid, but says 
he thought he could outbid the large oil companies because he didn't have as 
much overhead. After the winning bids were announced, Mr. Stroud became 
something of a celebrity. TV news crews arrived to interview his neighbors, 
many of whom had no idea what all the fuss was about. "I thought he [Mr. 
Stroud] was some kind of rap star," recalls Carline Thomas, who lives down 
the hall from him. 
As neighbors paused to shoot the breeze on the steps of nearby residential 
buildings, most marred by graffiti, Wall Street couriers bearing fat packets 
of information spent the week scurrying back and forth from Mr. Stroud's 
apartment on a seedy block in Harlem's central business district. 
Inside Mr. Stroud's apartment, the telephone wouldn't stop ringing, and his 
mother was helping him field the calls. He says he was in serious talks with 
four companies. And a movie producer was interested in his life story. Then, 
amid the chaos, tragedy struck. On Tuesday night, his mother, Iris Manning, 
suffered a cardiac arrest, and was taken to a hospital a few blocks south of 
Mr. Stroud's apartment. 
Mr. Stroud said he spent most of Wednesday running between his apartment and 
the hospital, taking occasional phone calls to deal with prospective 
financiers. Ms. Manning went into cardiac arrest three more times, and died 
at 9:47 p.m. Wednesday evening. 
Mr. Stroud was dazed by the fact that what he called the two biggest events 
of his life -- the death of his mother and his selection by the Energy 
Department -- occurred almost simultaneously. "I'm saying `there must be some 
reason I'm here,' " he said later. "These things happening like this, the 
odds must be in the millions." 
Mr. Stroud won't discuss which companies were vying for his oil, but he says 
at one point he thought he had an offer to buy him out for $1.50 a barrel, or 
$6 million. The most serious discussions began Thursday, with a 
representative from a refining company, which he refuses to name. From that 
discussion Thursday until the following evening, Mr. Stroud says, he was 
confident that the refiner would grant him the letter of credit he needed. 
But at 9 p.m. Friday, three hours before his deadline, Mr. Stroud said he got 
a call telling him the deal was off. "I was upset," he says. "I mean, instead 
of wasting my time with that I could have obtained the financing quickly" 
from some other source. 
A spokesman for Koch Industries Inc., based in Wichita, Kan., said it was in 
negotiations with both Messrs. Euell and Stroud. "We invited them to make a 
deal that made economic sense." BP Amoco said it also had discussions with 
Mr. Stroud. 
Mr. Stroud now says the DOE should have given him an extension, under the 
circumstances. "If your mother passes, aren't you given three days to 
grieve?" Mr. Stroud asks. His mother's funeral is scheduled for Wednesday, 
which would have been her 75th birthday, he says. 
Mr. Euell ran a small company, Euell Energy Resources, whose 12 employees 
helped him broker natural-gas sales and other small energy deals. By night, 
he worked the phones from his home in a modest Denver suburb, calling oil 
producers in Nigeria and energy brokers in Singapore and Sydney, always 
looking for the big score that would make him rich. 
A friend, Norman Early, a sometime golfing partner and a former Denver U.S. 
district attorney, says the 50-year-old Mr. Euell is "one of those guys who 
shoots for the stars." On Oct. 4, Mr. Euell thought he had hit one. He had 
been awarded the right to withdraw three million barrels of oil from the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, in exchange for returning 3.3 million barrels a 
year later. That was enough oil to fill 14,019 conventional tank trucks. 
Knowing he would need a partner to provide financial backing, Mr. Euell had 
already placed a call to a man he'd never met: Kenneth L. Lay, chairman and 
chief executive of Enron Corp. He said he was sure he was going to be one of 
the top bidders for the reserve oil. Would Enron like to be his partner? 
Within a few hours John Nolan, the giant energy company's vice president in 
charge of trading, called from London. Enron , he said, was interested. 
By Oct. 6, the price of oil had already fallen, making Mr. Euell's bid look 
generous. Still, he felt bullish. "I'm betting on Mother Nature, that she's 
coming back this winter and that oil's going to be more valuable." 
It wasn't Mother Nature, but the crisis in the Middle East that turned things 
around. Monday, Oct. 9, the target price for November oil futures on the New 
York Mercantile Exchange, jumped a dollar to $31.86 a barrel and headed 
higher. Mr. Euell flew to Houston and took a room at the Hyatt Regency, from 
which he could see Enron 's 50-story office tower. 
By Tuesday, the price of oil had hit $33.18. By Mr. Euell's calculations that 
meant a $3 million profit for him and an equal amount for his prospective 
partner just across the street. Enron 's lawyers were working on an agreement 
that would substitute Enron as the major party in Mr. Euell's contract, he 
said, and were drawing up the letter of credit for $93 million that the DOE 
required. 
Eager to close the deal, Mr. Euell called Enron trader Patrick Danaher, who 
was working on the project. "I want to sign this thing up today," Mr. Euell 
told him, claiming that he had received an offer from another, unnamed firm, 
offering to buy his contract for $1.2 million. According to tapes of the 
conversation provided by Enron , Mr. Danaher said the paperwork was under 
way: "Let me see if we can do that today." 
Mr. Euell called backed at 11:30 a.m. and again at 11:45 a.m. Each time, the 
trader sounded more pessimistic. Prospects were "50-50." When Mr. Euell 
suggested he had other offers, Mr. Danaher told him: "If you have a bid at 
$1.2 million, you should take it. A bird in the hand is worth two in the 
bush. I just have to tell you that." Still, he invited Mr. Euell to dinner. 
Tuesday's deadline passed without dinner or any action from Enron . While it 
appears from the tapes that the parties had been close to an accord, Eric 
Thode, a spokesman for Enron 's trading branch, says: "At no time was there 
anything remotely resembling a deal with Mr. Euell." 
Mr. Euell got the DOE to agree to extend the deadline for another 24 hours 
and, after a round of frantic phone calls, says he collected pledges from a 
group of European banks to support the $93 million letter of credit. But, 
when the new deadline expired, he still had failed to get the proper 
paperwork to the DOE, which then declared his award to have lapsed. "They 
played me," Mr. Euell complains, blaming Enron for the missed deadlines. 
Still, he says, the experience amounted to an instant "Ph.D." in oil. Next 
time, he vows, he will have his own letter of credit. 
The DOE said late last week that it will accept new bids on the seven million 
barrels of oil Messrs. Stroud and Euell forfeited. 
As for Mr. Peek, he remains the mystery man of the three. His company, 
Burhany Energy Industries Inc., was formed Aug. 21. It employs no one but Mr. 
Peek himself. Staffers at the Florida Black Business Investment Board, where 
Mr. Peek works as a business-development specialist, said he had taken last 
week off. Shutters were drawn at his modest, one-story house in Tallahassee. 
Phone calls to Mr. Peek were forwarded to an unidentified neighbor. In an 
e-mail to a reporter, Mr. Peek apologized for being unreachable. He was 
"working relentlessly to consummate this transaction" and couldn't "entertain 
any distraction at the moment." 
On Saturday, the Department of Energy announced that Mr. Peek had 
successfully transferred his interest in three million barrels of government 
oil to Hess Energy Trading Co. of New York, a partnership that includes 
Amerada Hess. Amerada Hess Vice President Carl Tursi said he could give few 
details of the deal, except to say that he believes there was an 
"arrangement" that resulted in "a lot of money" for Mr. Peek.

Financial 
DEAL OF THE WEEK; Artesia Seeks a Link To Information Firms

Rockville-based Artesia Technologies wasn't just interested in another 
venture capital investment. It wanted partners. 
In its recent $26 million funding, the digital asset management company's 
second round, its venture capital lead was joined by a group of "strategic 
partners." 
Artesia wanted to form relationships with other information management 
companies, instead of working only with banks or venture capital firms. "We 
wanted to make it more of a partnership with other companies," said Brian 
Hedquist, Artesia's marketing communications manager. 
For example, in September, Vignette Corp. of Austin announced an agreement 
with Artesia to create an Internet commerce application. Now with Vignette's 
investment, the relationship is strengthened. "It's not a pure financial 
investment," said Hedquist of the equity stake Vignette and the other 
strategic partners have in Artesia. "They have a vested interest. We're all 
going to benefit." 
Artesia was born last year in a management-led buyout with the help of $25 
million from Warburg Pincus. 
CEO Chris Veator created the company when he and a group of insiders led a 
buyout of the information management division of Boston-based financial 
information giant Thomson Financial Corp. 
Veator's idea was to jump into digital asset management for a broad array of 
clients, not just managing information for publishing companies and new 
organizations. 
"We found very quickly," Veator said, "that the real opportunity was not just 
in the publishing community." 
Company officials said the funding will help Artesia pursue more 
international expansion opportunities, the primary focus of which will be 
Europe, where Artesia opened a London office last June. Also, the financing 
will be used to increase the sales and marketing staff. Veator expects the 
staff to double and revenue to triple over the next 12 months, though he 
declined to give any financial information.

What public gets is at heart of arena issue 
By ERIC BERGER 
Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle 
When Enron Field opened this spring, the Astros boasted to fans that they 
were playing baseball the way it was meant to be -- on real grass, under the 
open sky. 
Blocks away, the Rockets and most of the city's political and business elite 
are asking voters for a new basketball arena. 
Yet, if voters approve the construction in the Nov. 7 election, the game 
still would be played indoors on a hardwood floor. An arena is, after all, an 
arena, and basketball already is played in Houston the way it was meant to 
be. 
The team points to such fan benefits as a flashier show, with modern video 
and sound equipment, and a more competitive team funded by higher revenues. 
The arena's influential backers say an arena would spur downtown development, 
strengthen the economy and help affirm Houston's position as a world-class 
city. 
For nonfans, it's difficult to predict how many of these benefits an arena 
actually would generate. More calculable is the financial effect it would 
have on Rockets owner Leslie Alexander and, to a lesser extent, the city of 
Houston. 
Compared with his bare-bones lease at Compaq Center, Alexander and the 12 
players who wear his uniform stand to benefit greatly. 
Based on estimates from other new arenas, Alexander stands to reap $30 
million to $45 million more a year were he to go from being a tenant at 
Compaq Center to being landlord of a new arena. For about $7 million a year, 
Alexander would enjoy revenue from such sources as 100 luxury suites, premium 
club seating near the court, selling the building's name and even bestowing 
upon Miller, Coors or some other brewer the right to sell $6 beers. 
Granted, going from tenant to landlord would boost his costs. Less the rent 
he now pays at Compaq Center, Alexander would spend $8 million to $10 million 
a year to keep the lights on. 
For players, there's no such overhead. They would share the windfall. Under 
the collective bargaining agreement ratified in January 1999, most revenues 
collected by NBA owners are stirred into a mythical pot, out of which 55 
percent is divided by the number of teams to determine a salary cap. 
For the city's part, it would spend less money buying and preparing land for 
the arena under this year's deal, with expenses capped at $20 million. A 
different location chosen in last year's plan would have cost the city at 
least $15 million more. 
Both this year and last the city was to own the land and arena after 30 
years. Now the city would get a parking garage, too. 
In the revised agreement, the city also would receive $200,000 a year, use of 
the arena for convention-related events or fund-raisers on 20 days a year, 
and a suite between the free-throw lines. 
It's a "much better deal" for Houston, says Mayor Lee Brown, who, as a chief 
negotiator and supporter of the previous deal, is among the least likely to 
make such admissions. 
City officials have valued the suite at $250,000 to $500,000 because it would 
allow Houston to woo convention center customers. The Rockets plan to sell 
the suites for $100,000 to $150,000 each. 
The suite actually could cost more than it is worth if the city opts to cater 
games for visitors. This year, the sports authority spent about $65,000 on 
food for about 80 dates at Enron Field. There would be at least twice as many 
events in the arena. 
The public would make its greatest contribution through the Harris 
County-Houston Sports Authority. 
That board would sell bonds to cover the arena's $175 million design and 
construction cost. Appointed by the city and county to collect hotel and car 
rental taxes to finance stadium construction, the 13-member sports authority 
also would repay a $30 million loan -- interest-free for the first five years 
-- from business leaders earmarked for a parking garage. 
What does the public get in return? 
"Something much bigger," said Ken Lay, co-chairman of the pro-arena campaign. 
"It's making Houston, Texas, and particularly downtown, a much more viable 
economic area. Making it more attractive for business to come to town, making 
it more attractive for conventions to come to town, and making it more 
attractive for the best and brightest talent in the world to come here and 
work with us." 
Moreover, supporters say a downtown arena, with its advanced sound and video 
systems, wider concourses, scores of restrooms and a constellation of 
eateries, would be like going from a phonograph to a hi-fi stereo. 
Some longtime Compaq Center patrons who have visited new arenas agree. 
"When people go to Enron Field they've had an experience," said fan Rebecca 
Tonahill, 53, who attends a couple of dozen Rockets and Comets games a year 
and has traveled to Los Angeles and Indianapolis arenas that opened last 
year. "You don't get an experience at Compaq Center, but I think they could 
capture some of that with the new arena." 
Overall analyses of the deal's bottom-line cost vary by how much the sports 
authority loses, if anything, from building the parking garage. 
Harris County Tax Assessor-Collector Paul Bettencourt calculates the Rockets 
would pay only 30 percent of the arena's total cost, which comes to $256 
million by his tally, and the public would pay the remainder. Ric Campo, the 
sports authority's financial whiz, contends the team's contribution would be 
closer to half of the $220 million he estimates as the total cost. 
Depending on how the numbers are manipulated, both are right. 
Bettencourt believes the public would pay the parking garage's entire $35 
million cost. 
A sore spot among tax watchdogs has been the sports authority building a 
garage that Alexander will have exclusive profit from during his events, 
including games involving the Rockets and Comets basketball teams and 
ThunderBears arena football team. 
Still, said Campo, the sports authority has use of the garage at all other 
times, which he says would be enough to cover annual garage payments. The 
private loan is interest-free for the first five years, which would save $9 
million. 
What is clear is that taxpayers would spend between $125 million and $175 
million to build an arena that would create wealth for a few. Arena opponents 
call it corporate welfare. Supporters say it's a good investment. 
It has happened before, to an even greater extent, with the construction of 
Enron Field for Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. and the football stadium for 
Houston Texans owner Bob McNair. 
"This point always raises serious questions about balance in people's minds," 
said Dennis Howard, a sports marketing professor at the University of Oregon. 
"Those paying the greatest share are not getting the benefit. They often 
can't even afford to go." 
The counter-argument from arena supporters is that visitors pay most hotel 
and car rental taxes. Bettencourt has studied the issue and concluded that 
locals pay at least 30 percent of the visitor taxes. 
Howard's research suggests about one of every 10 people who live in a market 
where a major-league sports team gets a new building ends up using the 
facility in a given year. However, the study did not differentiate arenas 
from football or baseball stadiums. Arenas probably would attract more people 
because of the many nonsporting events held there. 
Not only do fans pay for the building with taxes, they are hit again by more 
expensive tickets, said Howard, noting that average ticket prices jump by 30 
to 40 percent in a new building. 
The Rockets disputed that, citing a study of six recently opened arenas where 
prices jumped from 7 to 28 percent. The team's chief operating officer, 
George Postolos, said the Rockets have not raised the price of the most 
affordable tickets in five years. He said the team would remain committed to 
keeping a comparable number of affordable seats in a new arena. 
Customers buying expensive tickets, typically corporations, would feel the 
bulk of the increase. 
"Premium seat holders get more in a new building," he said, "and they pay 
more for it." 
Houston voters, at least, have a fairly clear idea of who is getting what in 
this deal. "It's all right there on the table," notes Bob Eury, president of 
Central Houston Inc. 
That is not always the case when teams and governments are eager 
collaborators in search of public support. In Indianapolis, for instance, 
local media suggested the agreement to build the $183 million Conseco 
Fieldhouse involved $104 million in private money and $79 million in public 
money. One reporter writing in the Indianapolis Star's special arena-opening 
section went as far as to write: "This isn't Houston or Hartford, Conn., or 
those other cities that swung open the public vault when it came time to pony 
up for new sports facilities." 
An arena built with less public than private money in such a small market 
would be something worth bragging about. 
The reality in the bond documents is much different: The city's capital 
improvement board sold $222.6 million worth of bonds to finance the arena and 
a parking garage. Those bonds will be repaid by a dizzying array of taxes, 
including a cigarette tax, car-rental tax, hotel tax, a tax on goods sold at 
the arena, and a diversion of state income taxes on player's salaries. 
The private contributions come from $10 million worth of donated land, a $37 
million loan to be repaid by the city, and, as touted by the Star, $57 
million from the Pacers basketball team. 
But the Pacers' "contribution" is made up almost entirely of revenues the 
city expects to generate from the arena's publicly financed parking garage 
when the team is not using it, according to an attorney who worked on the 
bond sale. 
Advertising for the arena in Houston so far has been accurate, but there are 
two sides to some of the numbers presented. 
A common claim is that the Rockets would pay $8.5 million a year in rent, 
appearing most recently in an Oct. 1 opinion piece by sports authority 
Chairman Billy Burge. This implies that more than half the $13 million to $14 
million the sports authority would pay on its arena debt each year would come 
from the Rockets. 
Actually, of this "rent," $1.6 million would be put into a fund for major 
arena repairs. Another $1.5 million would be paid to the sports authority, 
but if the sports authority could pay its annual debts, the money would be 
refunded to the Rockets. The sports authority would have enough money to pay 
its debt on three stadiums if its tax revenues rise at 3 percent. They have 
grown at around 10 percent in recent years. 
Finally, another $200,000 of the "rent" is paid to the city. 
Boosters also commonly promote arenas to voters as engines of economic 
development, generating millions of dollars in sales taxes. 
But even if the teams left, most personal leisure spending would simply be 
spent on movies, the arts or other forms of entertainment, said John 
Siegfried, a Vanderbilt University economics professor. 
The other major chunk, from sales taxes on corporate spending at the arenas, 
often comes from advertising budgets, he said, and there are other 
promotional activities where the money could be spent. 
"Repeatedly, we're finding the emperor has no clothes," said Howard, of 
Oregon. "These buildings are sold as economic development engines, but the 
economic impact they create is negligible." 
Studies by professional consultants may, and often do, find otherwise, but 
they are usually commissioned by a team or government seeking to justify 
public spending on a new facility, Siegfried said. 
Campo countered that building Enron Field has already fueled local economic 
gain from higher property tax revenues. The ballpark's 10 blocks of land were 
purchased at $12 per square foot, he said. A single block across the street 
was recently sold for $100 a square foot to Trammel Crow. 
Land values around the arena site have likewise doubled within the last year 
on speculation of development there. 
"That's creating a lot of value for the city, county and schools," Campo 
said. 
Economists, including four interviewed for this article, argue that spending 
public money in other ways, such as tax abatements to developers, would 
stimulate even more activity. They point to research in respected economic 
journals that has found higher high school graduation rates and more spending 
on police encouraged economic growth, whereas a major-league sports team 
actually put a drag on the economy. 
By Texas law, the sports authority may not spend the taxes it collects on a 
venue unless it is approved by voters, and it may spend its revenue only on 
sports facilities or other community projects like an arts center. 
Its 2 percent hotel tax and 5 percent car rental tax will not rise if the 
arena proposition passes. Adding arena payments to its existing debt would 
completely tap its resources, however. 
The board has not addressed what to do if the arena fails. To spend money on 
anything other than an approved venue, such as hospitals or schools as 
opponents suggest, would require legislative action.

FOR ARENA / Many concrete reasons to support this proposal Nov. 7
Staff

Houstonians are no strangers to the many arguments for and against the 
building of new sports arenas. We've hashed and rehashed them often in the 
past few years. We've put one facility - Enron Field for baseball downtown - 
on the map, and we're erecting another - a new football/rodeo stadium at the 
site of the Astrodome. 
A decision on a third piece - a downtown basketball/hockey arena - is 
forthcoming on the Nov. 7 election ballot.
The Chronicle urges voters to vote for the arena referendum. 
It makes sense for Houston to finish the third leg of this sports facility 
package as both a quality-of-life amenity and a valuable economic development 
tool. 
The arena proposal is essentially the same one, in terms of financing, as the 
others that were approved by voters in 1996. Tax dollars will be spent 
sparingly, taxpayer liability is limited, and taxpayers are even protected 
from having to pick up cost overruns. 
The fact there is a relative consensus on the proposal, or at least a lack of 
vigorous opposition as there was on a previous proposal, is a signal that 
this deal is a better one for Houston. The building's tenants, the Houston 
Rockets and Comets, are paying a fair share of the costs. 
Ticket and parking taxes have been eliminated from the new proposal. 
Many people find the "corporate welfare" aspect of publicly financed arenas 
distasteful, and some of their concerns have merit. But the reality is that 
major league sports teams are amenities that help cities and all of their 
residents. That's part of the reason so many cities compete to have them and 
retain them. 
Houstonians have debated this issue for years, and some people will adhere, 
no matter what, to the philosophy that sports teams shouldn't be publicly 
subsidized. Continued debate won't change their minds. 
We believe the presence of sports teams and facilities such as these is a 
plus for the city that far outweighs the public costs. 
It's not an esoteric, theoretical discussion. The proof is concrete - as 
concrete as the 18 new projects developed in downtown around Enron Field. 
They include a mix of residential, office and entertainment facilities 
totaling about $700 million. 
The economic activity these enterprises generate is already a boon to 
Houston's economy. The property value they add to the tax rolls will more 
than offset the public investment costs of Enron Field. 
Some critics of the arena have posited the theory that funds needed for 
public safety, such as improvements to the Fire Department, will be raided or 
shortchanged by the city's commitment to the arena. But that's simply not the 
case. The increased property taxes and other benefits of a more dynamic 
downtown will repay the city's investment many times over. That's new tax 
money available to the city's general fund, which pays for police and fire 
protection. So, it's not an either-or decision. 
Furthermore, what the stadium and all this activity have done for downtown, 
and for Houston's image as a whole, is quite remarkable. 
Remember, downtown's northeast quadrant was was a virtual ghost town of 
dilapidated warehouses and empty fields only a few months ago. Enron Field, 
coupled with Theater District development and other projects, has put to rest 
almost every argument that was made against the building of that stadium. 
A downtown arena would help complete the renaissance of the area and would 
put money into the public coffers. 
These are all strong reasons to vote enthusiastically for the arena proposal 
on Nov. 7.

A
Is new arena deal a slam-dunk for taxpayers? / Houston's costs, funding for 
NBA team compared to other cities
ERIC BERGER
Staff

10/15/2000
Houston Chronicle

(Copyright 2000)

Those who support subsidizing an arena to keep the Houston Rockets in Space 
City hail the deal struck this summer. It's better for taxpayers than last 
year's accord, they say. It's comparable to what the Astros and Texans got. 
Perhaps more important, they say, the agreement Houstonians will vote on Nov. 
7 is a "market deal" that compares favorably with other arenas built in 
recent years for National Basketball Association teams.
But does it really? 
A Houston Chronicle study of the seven most recently built U.S. arenas for 
NBA clubs reveals that four were constructed with less tax money than will be 
spent here if voters approve next month's arena proposition. One had a 
slightly larger public contribution and two were built with considerably more 
public money. 
There are good reasons for this, arena boosters contend. Unlike Houston, 
three of these four cities offering lesser subsidies provided other 
incentives. 
In Dallas and Los Angeles, they note, the government condemned whole blocks 
of land for private development around the arena. In Atlanta, Ted Turner was 
given carte blanche to develop public land. 
All of the markets that received a smaller subsidy also had both major league 
basketball and hockey teams, which could share the construction costs. Two 
teams generate more revenue, which tends to make the public contribution less 
vital. 
"This is one of the largest single-team contributions to a building ever," 
said Rockets Chief Operating Officer George Postolos, whose team is paying 
about $7 million a year for control of the Houston arena. 
Still, there is another general rule of thumb when it comes to determining a 
public subsidy. Historically, the less populous a city and its suburbs, the 
more public money is needed to complete an arena project. With their bevy of 
Fortune 500 companies, larger cities far outstrip the mid-sized markets' 
capacity to buy the pricey suites and club seats that make new arenas so 
lucrative for NBA owners. 
Strikingly, an arena was built with far fewer tax dollars in one city smaller 
than Houston - Denver. 
Atlanta, a market comparable to Houston, built an arena with considerably 
less public money. 
This was also the case in two larger markets. Los Angeles built an arena with 
almost no public money, and Dallas' expensive project had substantially less 
public than private money involved. 
Only two of the cities reviewed, San Antonio and Indianapolis, built arenas 
with larger public money contributions, which is consistent with their 
relatively small market stature. 
"The arena deal follows the Enron Field-type of model," said Harris County 
Tax Assessor-Collector Paul Bettencourt, who released a study critical of 
Houston's arena plan but has not campaigned against it. "It's consistent with 
how the baseball and football stadiums were built in Houston. 
"But it's clearly not the model for arenas in the rest of the country, from 
Los Angeles to Atlanta to Denver." 
Conservative activist Bruce Hotze, who recently launched an effort against 
the arena, says Houston should follow the example of other cities where the 
owners of sports teams - such as the Utah Jazz in 1991 - have primarily paid 
for their facilities. He characterizes anything less as corporate welfare. 
The list of factors determining how far a team can dip into public coffers 
goes on, from the breadth of a team's local following to its success and its 
owner's popularity, said Andrew Zimbalist, a Smith College economics 
professor. 
But the overriding factor is probably simpler, he said. 
"The best strategy for any team to follow is to ask for so much money that 
the referendum passes by a tenth of a percentage point," Zimbalist said. 
"Teams will get as much as they can. If it passes by 5 percent, the owner, 
usually a smart businessman, has done himself a disservice." 
Another big factor is a threat to move. 
This has loomed over Houston since NBA Commissioner David Stern announced 
earlier this year that he was "certain" the Rockets would leave town without 
a new building. 
When the Denver Nuggets wanted a new arena in the mid-1990s they had a decade 
left on their lease. The Rockets have just three years left before they can 
leave Houston. Otherwise, Denver's circumstances as its leaders began 
negotiating with the team were remarkably similar to Houston's. 
The city had just spent about $200 million in public money to build Coors 
Field for the Colorado Rockies baseball team, and was contemplating an even 
larger expenditure to replace Mile High Stadium for the NFL's Broncos. 
But when it came to the city-owned McNichols Arena, built, like Compaq 
Center, in 1975, the attitude was that if the team's owner wanted a new 
building he would have to do it largely with public money, said Dean Bonham, 
a Denver-based sports consultant. Eventually, the owner got some city 
concessions totaling about $30 million but paid for all the arena's 
construction costs. 
A few years later in Houston, after building Enron Field and ponying up for a 
new football stadium, public leaders have signed a similar, heavily 
subsidized plan for the basketball team. 
What was it that opened Houston's treasury when Denver's was closed? 
"I can sum the difference up in one word: leverage," Bonham said. "The Denver 
teams weren't going anywhere soon. The Rockets got a green light to go." 
In Miami, a smaller market where a building was constructed with slightly 
more public money than would be spent in Houston, the Heat's first arena was 
only 8 years old when the team asked for a new facility. 
At first team officials, amid threats of leaving, managed to cut a deal with 
the Miami-Dade County Commission to build a $165 million arena on Biscayne 
Bay with only $50 million coming from the team. 
But leading up to a referendum a new county mayor, Alex Penelas, was elected 
in part because he campaigned against public financing for the arena, saying 
the county had "given away the kitchen sink." 
Later, a deal was struck in which the team paid for the arena's construction 
and the county bought bayfront property and helped the team with annual 
operating costs. 
This dramatic game of building publicly backed sports stadiums with 
questionable public support is so familiar throughout the United States that 
it has practically become the fifth major league sport. 
More than $21.7 billion has been spent or committed on 95 built or planned 
big-league stadiums since 1990, and, according to several economists' 
calculations, two-thirds of that money comes from public sources. 
In Houston, more than two-thirds of the nearly $1 billion in built, planned 
or proposed stadiums since 1996 has or would come from public sources. 
In spring 1996, citing aging facilities and unprofitable leases, the Oilers 
had left town and the Astros were making threats. The still-champion Rockets 
were bound here into the new century, but would soon sue to break that lease 
and were making no promises beyond 2003. 
The Astrodome and Compaq Center had lost their sheen amid a nationwide tide 
of stadium building that is only now ebbing. Political leaders decided they 
must do something to stop the defection of Houston's pro sports teams. 
For several months, a blue-ribbon commission chaired by Pete Coneway and Ben 
Love tackled the issue, ultimately deciding, as elsewhere around the country, 
that the city and county should help build new facilities for baseball, 
football and basketball. 
>From this blueprint arose the Harris County-Houston Sports Authority, which 
has helped fund two of those facilities and is seeking voter approval to 
spend its remaining tax revenues on a new downtown basketball arena. 
The Astros hit the jackpot with Enron Field, which has propelled their 
attendance to more than 3 million for the first time. After the Oilers made 
good on their threat to move to Nashville, it took Bob McNair's $700 million 
and Texas charm, as well as a $367 million football stadium, to bring the NFL 
back. 
Sports authority members say that if McNair's experience teaches Houston 
anything, it will take a far greater investment than the proposed arena's 
costs to return the NBA should the Rockets leave. 
They point out as well that in building both the baseball and football 
stadiums, although each cost more than the arena, Alexander would pay more 
than has either McNair or Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. 
Houston's arena deal, as complicated as it appears, lacks the hidden value 
attached to some other deals, which Rockets officials say makes sports team 
owners in the other markets appear less mercenary at first blush. 
More than two years ago Dallas voters approved a $125 million public 
contribution to a new arena by a handful of votes in a citywide referendum. 
A scrappy coalition of opponents, which had only $75,000 to spend, tried to 
point out that the public was giving up much more than the $125 million. 
Beneath that widely reported figure was essentially freedom for the arena 
developers, Dallas Mavericks owner Ross Perot Jr. and Dallas Stars owner Tom 
Hicks, to proceed with an 18-city block, $1 billion overall development with 
the city's blessing. 
In January, Perot sold the Mavericks basketball team to Internet billionaire 
Mark Cuban. 
Perot, who had bought the team only four years earlier, said he was 
interested in the new arena largely for the related development 
opportunities. 
"A lot of people look at a basketball team as an anchor tenant for an arena. 
I look at an arena as the anchor tenant for a much larger program," he said 
upon selling the Mavericks. His Hillwood Development Corp. retained the 
development rights. 
To aid the development, the city of Dallas condemned much of the land and 
offered as much as $30 million for infrastructure work to spruce up the 
property. 
The city also let both the Stars, a hockey team, and Mavericks out of their 
Reunion Arena leases several years early and went so far as to ensure no 
other sports referendums would be on the same ballot. Hillwood also got a 4 
percent construction management fee and Hicks 1.5 percent as part of the $325 
million in public and private money spent on the arena. 
"Oh sure, there were kickbacks and all that," said Sharon Boyd, co- 
chairwoman of the opposition group It's a Bad Deal! 
"It was like all of a sudden there were five men in Dallas that got free land 
and didn't have to pay taxes. That's a sweet deal." 
Like Dallas, Atlanta offered Ted Turner a plush real estate deal to keep the 
Hawks basketball team in the city, freeing up the NBA team to pay more than 
half the arena's actual construction cost. 
Hawks' owner Turner Broadcasting Co. was given 10 years to add development to 
the public land the arena was built on, with streets, roads, sidewalks and 
other needed infrastructure paid for with tax money. 
In Los Angeles, the city condemned most of about 30 acres surrounding the 
privately developed Staples Center for a hotel, restaurants and an 
entertainment district. 
"The subsidies take all kinds of forms," said Robert Baade, an economics 
professor at Lake Forest College in Illinois. 
"The cities and teams have become much more clever about how they finance 
these things and hide the public subsidies." 
Monday: Who would pay, who would benefit from a new arena.

Attached please find a Tax Review of California Assembly Bill No. 128 ("AB 
128X").  The Tax Review sets out the practical implication (increased cost to 
purchasers) and constitutional deficiencies of AB 128X.

The third paragraph of the Tax Review details the mathematical computation of 
the tax and the resulting purchaser price increase.  The computation sales 
price, $300/MWh, reflects the SP15 (Southern California) weighted average 
index price ($302.88), rounded to the nearest hundred, as reported in 
Megawatt Daily's May 8th MarketReport.  However, it may be more effective to 
present the mathematical computation with a price closer to the proposed base 
price of $60/MWh.  We are available to assist in presenting the computation 
utilizing whichever numbers you deem appropriate.

The California Senate has passed SB 1X, Windfall Profits Tax on Electric 
Generators.  We will forward a similar memorandum addressing SB 1X.

We are available to address questions and/or comments.  Thanks.

Please have someone contact me at 425-503-4339 (cell telephone) or at the 
address on the web site underlined below  if 
Enron has an interest in the U.S. and internationally patented Angle Master. 
We now have marketing prototypes made, patents in place, outstanding consumer 
interest and are ready to proceed to the 
next step. 
The Angle Master can be very large or  small.. The output gear smoothly 
transitions from 0-90 degrees at high torque to 
to reach or drill any angle. The input gear can be driven by any device. No 
product on the market can perform 
like the Angle Master. I can see the use of the Angle Master for various 
drilling applications, including horizontal drilling 
Professional mechanics in all fields who have seen the smaller Angle Master 
all want one. We have endorsements from professional 
drivers, mechanics, and many others. 
A recently retired Captain of a nuclear aircraft carrier has stated in a 
letter "....The use of the Angle Master.... will 
result in a significant time savings which in turn will increase combat 
readiness of aircraft and ships due to the more rapid 
turnaround of out of commission systems. Every mechanic will want the Angle 
Master in their toolbox after they have seen it in 
operation." 
A Senior Vice President of Operations for a major Aerospace Company has 
stated in writing " .... Prototype manufacturing, 
tool manufacturing, assembly, repair and overhaul operations will all benefit 
from the flexibility of the Angle Master." 
The attached web page location underlined below is not yet completed, but it 
indicates just a few 
of thesmaller scale uses for the Angle Master. 
I look forward to hearing from you.

Subject: DRAFT response to Greenpeace Kyoto letter

Attached is a first draft of a response to Greenpeace's April 5 letter to 
Jeff Skilling asking for Enron's answers to some specific questions on the 
Kyoto Protocol and climate change.   Similar letters were delivered by 
Greenpeace Europe in native languages to Enron's offices in the UK, 
Netherlands, Spain, and Belgium.

I have attached a copy of one of the letters below.  All the questions are 
the same in each.

I have drafted a response with the goals of:

1)  Being responsive to Greenpeace without being defensive or without 
"greenwashing."   We have an already-published public "statement" on climate 
change and a very positive, solution-oriented story to tell, with many facts 
and accomplishments to back up our statements.   I think our letter can land 
in the stack that they consider "positive" responses, and not in the stack of 
non-responses or "we don't care" responses.

2)  Steering away from directly answering the no-win questions about "Kyoto." 
  I think we can respond to the letter in a way that provides meaningful 
answers to the general themes of the letter.   I have discussed this with 
many of you already, but I strongly feel that we should not get dragged down 
into debates over what we like/dislike, support/oppose about Kyoto....we'll 
quickly get into questions we can't now answer, and may never be able to 
answer.   I'd prefer it if we rise above the politics of the issue and look 
solution-oriented by saying counties and companies should continue to be 
engaged in this important issue.

3)  Developing corporate-wide messages that we can use in multiple 
applications -- arming our PR and govt. affairs advocates with a tight script 
to use in their efforts; responding to shareholder inquiries and annual 
meeting Q&A;  Ken Lay or other executive speeches and presentations; 
something for our Corporate Responsibility annual report.  

Sorry for the long preamble, but climate change has become a very sensitive 
issue of late, and our message/strategy needs to be very coordinated and we 
need to have one clear set of statements that everyone in the company can 
understand and use.  With that said, I also believe that these messages 
should be used very carefully, as the subject matter is complex and straying 
too far from the basics can be dangerous.  We should designate one or two 
clear spokespeople that can answer any follow up to the Greenpeace letter by 
press or policymakers, and really stick to the boundaries of what's in our 
response letter.

There is also the issue of customizing responses from the European offices, 
using this letter as a template and adding a few examples of Enron good deeds 
in the local areas.   I am not opposed to doing so, but would again 
appreciate being able to review these responses before they go.  Please let 
me know if you have other views.

I would like to send our response by early next week, maybe even Monday 4/23 
if we can turn it around that fast.  Thank you for your input and assistance 
and I look forward to your reply.

Jeff

Subject: What we would like Lay to get from Davis  

Marty.  This is a summary of our message from this morning for you to send on 
or discuss with Keene.  I hope this is helpful.  Scott

What's important
Give solvency to the utilities by guaranteeing no banckruptcy against the 
generation assets of the utilities.  Guarantees to be recovered, if needed, 
through surcharges over 10 years.  This should give the process time for 
thoughtful solutions.  Ending the rate freeze now will give the utilities an 
undeserved windfall (3.5b alone related to nuclear assets in year 2001).
There should be thoughtful process to determine: i) how to keep deregulation 
going, ii) how existing generation assets should be used, iii) what are the 
value of existing assets, iv) when is the appropriate time for customers to 
be exposed to the market, and v) what kind of market structure would be 
appropriate going forward. 
Customers should not be dumped into the market, now or in the next year, 
while it is extremely illiquid due to many errors of the utilities.
There should not be retroactive rate making (the negative ctc should be paid 
until at least the rate freeze is ended)
All customers should be treated equally with respect to existing generation 
assets that they paid for for the past 4-30 years.
There should be a special hearing called to debate demand side prospects (ie. 
curtailment etc.)

Subject:  Confidential Information and Securities Trading
 
To keep pace with the fluid and fast-changing demands of our equity trading 
activities, Enron Wholesale Services ("EWS") has recently revised its 
official Policies and Procedures Regarding Confidential Information and 
Securities Trading ("Policies and Procedures"). These revisions reflect two 
major developments: (1) our equity trading activities have been extended into 
the United Kingdom, and (2) in an effort to streamline the information flow 
process, the "Review Team" will play a more centralized role, so that the 
role of the "Resource Group" is no longer necessary.You are required to 
become familiar with, and to comply with, the Policies and Procedures. The 
newly revised Policies and Procedures are available for your review on 
LegalOnline, the new intranet website maintained by the Enron Wholesale 
Services Legal Department. Please click on the attached link to access 
LegalOnline:
 
http://legalonline.corp.enron.com/chinesewall.asp
 
If you have already certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures 
during the 2001 calendar year, you need not re-certify at this time, although 
you are still required to to review and become familiar with the revised 
Policies and Procedures. If you have not certified compliance with the 
Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, then you must do so 
within two weeks of your receipt of this message. The LegalOnline site will 
allow you to quickly and conveniently certify your compliance on-line with 
your SAP Personal ID number. If you have any questions concerning the 
Policies or Procedures, please call Bob Bruce at extension 5-7780 or Donna

I know we are holding for a later filing, but I have attached further 
comments anyway.  The document is still too rough to send out.  We need to 
take the opportunity, as soon as possible, to get a hard hitting, thoroughly 
researched and carefully written document in front of the Commissioners.  
California's reaction to the Judge's recommendation is likely to give FERC 
(especially the new commissioners) a feel for how irrational the California 
politicians can be.  We will have a limited opportunity to take advantage of 
that realization.  We need to hit it hard in the pleading, our conversations 
at the Commission, the Hill and the media.

Hi Steve -

I won't be able to make the call on Monday.

I'd be happy to volunteer not to be on the negotiating team.  It sounds
like there's no shortage of people who want to be on the committee.

My big issue is default service.  This industry needs real customers and
the only way to get real customers is to get rid of default service. 
Starting with big customers, along the lines of the core/non-core gas
model, is the best way to go.  The only way to sell this, however, is to
get the big customers to agree it's a good idea.

Lora:

This is the new "Final" version.  The difference from the earlier version is 
- a few slides were taken out and the order of the remaining slides were 
rearranged.

Please get a copy of this new "Final" to Ken Lay.  

Thanks.

Subject: CFTC Reauthorization

At his request, I met Lee Sachs, Assistant Treasury Secretary, who had 
requested the meeting after a brief conversation recently.  Lee said that 
senior-level negotiations led by Secretary Summers were initiated last week 
between the CFTC and SEC and that progress was being made on the single stock 
futures issue (the major issue postponing movement of the legislation).  

As you know, the House completed committee work on HR 4541 before it 
recessed.  The bill will now is pending before the Rules Committee where 
differences will be worked out between the three different Committee versions 
(Agriculture, Commerce, and Banking).  The Senate Agriculture Committee 
passed out the Senate version in July.  However, the bill is not moving 
quickly in the Senate due to Senator Phil Gramm's desire to see significant 
changes made to the legislation (not directly related to our energy 
language). Last week at the Republican Convention, I asked the Senator about 
the bill and he said they were working on it, but much needs to be changed 
for his support.  More telling perhaps, were Wendy Gramm's comments that she 
would rather the current bill die if a better bill can be passed next year.  
What this means is that we must, at the least, remove Senator Gramm's 
opposition to the bill to move the process and more importantly seek to gain 
his support of the legislation.

Lee Sachs message was just that.  I told Lee that we shared his desire to 
move the legislation as long as it contains a full exclusion for all 
non-agriculture commodities (including metals).  He said that we would have a 
difficult time defending the metals provision politically. But, Lee said  "we 
would not find Treasury opposition to the House Commerce Committee language" 
(which includes favourable language on energy and metals).   This is a 
positive development, because it isolates the CFTC from its key defenders and 
I hope ensures no veto threat on our issues.  However, I do not expect 
Treasury to be vocal in support of our position.  It is clear that 
Congressional leaders and the Administration want to get this bill done this 
year and there remains a good opportunity for enactment.

However, with less than 20 or so legislative days left, we need Senator Gramm 
to engage.  A call from Ken Lay in the next two weeks to Senator Gramm could 
be an impetus for Gramm to move his staff to resolve the differences.  Gramm 
needs to fully understand how helpful the bill is to Enron.  Let me know your 
thoughts on this approach.   I am prepared to assist in coordinating the call 
and drafting the talking points for a Ken Lay/Sen. Gramm call.

I talked to Hettie today.  It's unlikely that we are going to find time for 
Jeff and the Governor to talk (because of the Governor's schedule).  We'll 
try to set something up later.  In the meantime, the Governor should just 
sign the bill.  Of course, Hettie had already communicated this; the Gov's 
office acknowledged that the message was recieved but did not make a specific 
commitment.

Thanks for the update.  The Western Governors remain the best avenue we have 
for preventing price caps and California's attempts to secede from the grid.  
We need to keep pushing information to them regarding these issues.  Attached 
is some text I have been using for correspondence with policy makers 
regarding California issues.  Feel free to use it.

1. I'm sure the RGA dinner in Aspen is going to be a real struggle for you - 
what a great deal!!!
2. I'd put Steve Kean on the e-mail.  Also, John Neslage so he can keep these 
updates and a calendar for the Team.
3. Is Guinn Governor of Nevada?  I know that Leslie Lawner was working on an 
EES issue and maybe hiring someone with good connections.

		 Subject: Western Governors update

All---here's an update on what we've been doing with the Governors.  Should I 
be putting Steve Kean on these email updates?




As you all know, there were several governors events over the past 3 to 4 
days in Washington DC:

Paul and I met with Steve Reynolds from Wyoming Gov Geringer's office.  They 
would like us to put forward the name of an Enron individual that could 
participate in an Energy council that is being formed (actually commissioned 
by the legislature) to study energy issues for the state.  Geringer would 
also like to come to Houston to learn about our vision in moving from an 
assets based to a market based entity.  

We had contacted Scott Cealy (spelling) with Arizona Governor Hull's office 
last week and  Paul sat with Gov Hull at the RGA dinner on Monday night and 
had a chance to thank her for her  leadership in opposing price caps. Mr. 
Cealy left me a voice mail this afternoon basically inviting us to come to 
see them. I will schedule that meeting (boy that Paul must have been charming 
at dinner!!!)

I sat with Gary Smith, political guy with Gov Kempthorne's office who 
indicated that Kempthorne was scheduled to meet with Vice Pres Cheney on 
Tuesday afternoon.  Gov Kitzhaber was also scheduled to attend the meeting 
with Cheney, but there was speculation that he may not come.  I have not 
confirmed the outcome of that meeting, but was invited by Mr. Smith to call 
him once they get back to Idaho tommorrow.  I will place that call and see 
what I can find out.  Mr. Racicot was going to get back to us on what he 
found out from Kempthorne---has Linda or Rick heard from him?  I will be 
continueing outreach with Gary Smith on as routine a basis is acceptable to 
him.

We have committed to an RGA event in Aspen Colorado on March 30 that Governor 
Owens is sponsoring.  Paul and I continue to keep in touch with Gov Owens 
staff.  As most of you know from previous updates, Owens is strong in his 
support against price caps and market based solutions.

At our meeting with Racicot on Monday in DC Paul requested some assistance 
from him in setting up a meeting with Kitzhaber.  Linda--how do we want to 
follow up on that request?

Rick and Paul met with Gov Gary Locke on Tuesday and while they disagreed 
with Lockes position, the discussion was civil and at least left the door 
open to future discussions.  Rick and Paul will manage this relationship for 
now.

We have not has great success in meeting with Leavitt.  I will continue to 
work on setting that up.  Guinn has also not been extremely receptive to 
meeting with us and Paul and I will look at how/whether we continue to knock 
on that door.  We are not actively looking to meet with Montana due to some 
commercial reasons.

There are a number of other ongoing actions (WGA contacts, providing info, 
etc), but the above update should give everybody the highlights.

Thanks for the message.  It's good to hear from you again.  We have already 
hired Racicot (who now works for Bracewell and Patterson), but I'm not sure 
that our arrangement would include what you may need, so I'm copying Linda 
Robertson in our DC office.  Also, I'll copy Jim Derrick so he knows we might 
expand our relationship there.
Linda and Joe - thoughts on BPA and EOL?

		 Subject: Several matters

Hi, Steve!  Long time no talk.  I hope you are well - I KNOW you are busy!  I
just have a couple of matters for your attention:

1.  We, as part of a group of Northwest IOUS, are exploring the possibility of
retaining former Montana Governor Racicot to work BPA issues on our behalf. 
PGE will continue with Mike Andrews as our lobbyist but Racicot would work for
the IOUs as a group.  Does this cause you any concerns?  Incidentally, we may
step up our efforts somewhat in the general area of BPA because of the
situation out here.  Please let me know if I or Mike should be coordinating
what we do with any of your folks in DC.

2.  One of the major Northwest issues is who will be the next BPA
Administrator.  For a variety of reasons, there really aren't any good
candidates from the Northwest and we're probably all to close to the situation
anyway.  I was wondering if the Enron net could come up with any good ideas
for someone with good energy and policy experience from outside the Northwest?
 Someone who would appeal to the Bush administration?  

3.  With the delay in closing our sale to Sierra, we would very much like the
ability to use Enron Online for trading.  I believe we can get the regulatory
approvals necessary but apparently when we raised this some months ago, there
was strong opposition from within Enron, particularly Joe Hartsoe.  Do you see
an issue with pursuing this?  How do you suggest I move this forward?

Thanks, Steve.  As you may hear from time to time, things are going well here
in Oregon.  We are proceeding on our restructuring, which is beginning to get
notice from NARUC and others as a possible model for states that have not yet
proceeded.  It's an interesting world.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Business
Enron Plays The Pipes This old-time gas company is trading fuel for a future 
as a new-economy
superpower. Will the swap work?
Frank Gibney Jr./Houston

It's Saturday night, and the only thing between you and a movie from 
Blockbuster Video is the unpaid late fee for
last week's rental. If that sounds familiar, then you'll appreciate this: 
next year Blockbuster plans to offer up to 500
movie titles online in more than a dozen major cities around the U.S. That's 
right, video on demand (not the
frustrating no-rewind, no-pause pay-per-view offerings of today) for anyone 
with a DSL line at home. 

What's remarkable is that Blockbuster's partner happens to be an energy 
company called Enron. At a time when
so many old-economy companies seem helpless against the dizzying pace and 
technology of the digital age,
Enron is demonstrating why FORTUNE magazine keeps voting it the most 
innovative large company in America.
For years the Houston-based firm simply produced, transported and marketed 
natural gas. Then, as energy
deregulation threatened profit margins in the gas business, Enron discovered 
it could make billions by trading and
brokering packages of energy the way Midwesterners do pork bellies. Now Enron 
is moving into the
telecommunications business, with a national fiber-optic cable network and a 
floor bulging with Sun
supercomputers.

In fact, Enron may be the most interesting old-economy company around. Since 
moving its trading operations from
the phone to the Web eight months ago, the company has doubled revenues to 
more than $30 billion. Most of that
is made through trading everything from energy and paper to weather risk 
derivatives and now bandwidth--more than
800 offerings in all. Think of eBay, but instead of auctioning $5 used Baby 
Gap pajamas, the company trades
$600,000 blocks of natural gas--and pockets commensurately huge commissions. 
Boasts Enron president Jeffrey
Skilling: "In terms of dollars transacted, we're the world's largest online 
site by a factor of 10." 

So far this year, that has meant $120 billion in transactions. And when 
you're running the network, all sorts of
profitable opportunities arise. Last week, when word spread that natural-gas 
prices would spike this winter, Enron's
in-house traders saw their gains surge as customers raced to lock in future 
supplies at today's prices. And Enron's
stock price? It hit $90 last week, tripling its value of a year ago. Kind of 
like an Internet play, only better. 

The market loves Enron because Skilling and CEO Kenneth Lay seem to have come 
up with a business model that
works for just about anything. They provide a service to their customers by 
packaging a supply of name your
commodity and then using the efficiency of their vast network to beat most 
prices. They arrived at this model back
in the mid-1980s almost out of desperation, when crude-oil prices had 
collapsed, natural-gas deregulation had
thrown that market into chaos, and the Peruvian government had just 
nationalized Enron's offshore properties.
Figuring they might as well leverage deregulation instead of succumbing to 
it--call it business judo-- Skilling, a
McKinsey & Co. consultant at the time, came up with a plan called the Gas 
Bank, to buy up reserves of natural
gas, then package them for sale, with various prices and conditions for 
different customers. When electricity
markets deregulated a few years ago, the company did the same. It's the 
oldest concept in business: buy low, sell
high. 

Enron also leverages its assets and expertise to provide services to big 
customers. Since 1997, companies like
Owens Corning and Chase Manhattan Bank have signed long-term, 
multibillion-dollar contracts with Enron
subsidiary Enron Energy Services (EES) that lock in their energy costs for up 
to 10 years and provide Enron with a
steady revenue stream. What's more, Enron is beginning to actively manage its 
clients' heating and cooling plants,
installing new equipment when necessary and monitoring it all over the 
Internet. 

Skilling's latest gambit is to apply the same principles he learned in the 
power and energy sectors to making Enron
a leader in the booming telecommunications business. The plan isn't to go 
head to head with established fiber-optic
carriers such as AT&T, Qwest and Williams Communications. Instead, Enron 
wants to use new switching
technology and its expertise in trading pipeline access to transform a modest 
telecom network into a powerful
arbiter of bandwidth. Enron's bet is simple: supply and demand will increase 
exponentially, turning bandwidth into a
tradable commodity, just like gas and electricity. Along the way, why not 
partner with companies such as
Blockbuster and use this new technology to offer content--like movies- -and 
blow it through existing, underutilized
pipe? "They are jump- starting an application [telecom content] with a 
potential market of $200 billion a year," says
Tom Nolle, president of the telecom consulting firm CIMI. 

Other new-economy players are also beginning to see the power merchant as a 
prize partner. IBM and AOL have
joined with Enron to form the New Power Co. (TNPC), an independent start-up 
that will offer pricing schemes and a
choice of power and gas service for residential and small-business customers. 
Enron provides the electricity; AOL
enables customers to buy it via the Web; and IBM takes care of the billing. 
"It's ludicrous that we're in the 21st
century, and you still have people jumping over fences to read meters," says 
Skilling, pointing out that the
technology exists to offer real-time pricing for gas and electricity. In 
deregulated markets, TNPC will allow
consumers to switch power companies as easily as they do phone companies. 

Despite all Wall Street's enthusiasm for Enron's bold plans, there are still 
plenty of skeptics. Critics point out that
there is barely a market today for the company's bandwidth trading exchange. 
They also stress that pushing digital
signals through pipe is a world away from routing natural gas. Although there 
is plenty of cable across the country,
carriers are not set up to mix and match access to it. "It's a very, very 
difficult concept," says Nolles. Even the
Blockbuster venture is risky: technology aside, there is also the highly 
political question of digital rights. How do
you satisfy Hollywood that its content is secure? 

But Skilling and his lieutenants are quick to counter that everyone thought 
they were crazy to try to make markets
in gas and electricity. And Enron, after all, is a company that thrives on 
entrepreneurial defiance of convention.
Many of its new ventures were started because managers simply set new ideas 
in motion without waiting for
approval from the top. Even the online operation was cobbled together in a 
mere seven months. Skilling and Lay
found out about EnronOnline only two weeks before it went live. 

Is taking risks really a part of a gas-pipeline company's culture? Just ask 
John Arnold, the 26-year-old chief of
natural-gas derivatives, who after nine hours and $1 billion in trades last 
Wednesday had this to say: "You can't turn
away for a minute or you get picked off." That has happened to too many 
traditional companies because they were
unable to find a niche in the new economy. Enron, however, has traded its way 
into a starring role, and now it
hopes it is ready for the movies.

I talked to Ken Lay and he will support Carol as VP.  I have talked to Carol 
and she knows the process.  We are going to take her up at the next Excom 
meeting.  I don't think there is anything you need to do right now.

Any progress on determining how Carol would be accepted as a VP by the 
Executive Committee?    I have not been able to talk to her and am worried 
she might feel neglected.

Linda - as we discussed, adding a sentence on open access is key.  Also, I 
would delete the sentence about the transmission system not being designed 
for the way it's being used today.

It would be nice to get a one sentence mention made of open access just to 
show they care....I say this in part because of Scott Miller's e-mail 
pleading for more focus on this issue. Thanks.

Subject: White House Talking Points and Abraham Mtg with EPSA

1.  I am faxing to you a bootleg copy of the draft talking points Ed received 
this morning at the White House energy "messaging" meeting.  These are very 
close hold.   Ed asked that we not circulate these to anyone.  Ed asked us to 
give him feedback of any concerns we have with the talking points (he will be 
giving them comments).  After glancing at the TPs, the obvious missing point 
is open access.  However, I am not sure we should be alarmed about that.  
There really isn't any policy in the TPs.  This is a typical WH message 
document.   Let me know if you think it is imperative to insert open access.  
Also, Ed would like to position us as the coalition leader of the White House 
outreach effort.  Any thoughts? 

2.  I am faxing to you EPSA's summary of the generators meeting with 
Secretary Abraham.  I am glad I did not attend this meeting.  As you will see 
from the summary, there were three parts to the meeting:  a) an exchange of 
policy views, both long and short term, b) discussion of how to maximize 
generator output in Calif; and c) a request that industry participate in a 
DOE reliability group.  I don't see any follow up for Enron, outside of our 
normal course of activities and independent interchange with DOE officials.  
Let me know if you have additional thoughts.

Michael,

I received today the attached letter from Jonathon Rosenthal of Saybrook
Capital.

Based on the conversation you and I had yesterday, I think that a proper
counter proposal would be to meet in LA, organize a credit committee,
and instruct Saybrook to seek funding from PG&E and SCE.  But, I would
be interested in hearing your thoughts.

I think the presentation looks good.  In the meeting itself I think you 
should go heavy on the argument that it makes no sense for Sempra 
shareholders to be in a commodity market as a regulated entity -- the "heads 
they win tails you lose" argument.

Steve,


I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  If 
you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.









As far as recommendations, here is a short list:

 1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales 
above monthly index without enough consideration of future 
      replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be 
injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.
                    This creates a shortage in later months.

 2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet 
demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.  
                      Specific questions should include:  

  1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order 
to fill storage?

  2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too 
much gas from Socal's system.  
       I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their 
own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than 
their injection capablity, but injected far less.

 3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short 
term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major 
                    LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating 
rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market 
and the 
     consumer has benefitted.  


Call me if you need any more input.


Phillip

I think this is a good idea.  We may want to think about CNBC as well.
Brandon -- any technical obstacles?
Margaret/Cindy -- how does the link work?  does it go straight to the clip or 
do users have to navigate within CNN's site?

Steve,

I spoke with Margaret and she mentioned she also takes the same route as I've 
started, to obtain the electronic link for CNN stories/profiles of Enron.  
Although, the contract looks like it only allows us Intranet use and not 
Internet use as well.  This premise was confirmed by Margaret too, because 
she recalls paying $2,000.00 for a Intranet/Internet video link, and only 
$500.00 for a Intranet link.  My unsolicited recommendation would be to 
purchase the external link as well as the internal link.  I believe we would 
get a lot of mileage out of posting this link on our website - with 
downloadable supporting software - to allow users to view the video.  From a 
PR perspective, I would refer 90% of incoming inquiries to our site, as well 
as sending them general company info.  Also, it would unequivocally 
illustrate and promote why Enron's has been voted 'Most Innovative Company' 
for five consecutive years in a row.

Now...enough of my blabber and to the point...I am still waiting to hear back 
from CNN to assess exact pricing for both types of links.  I've placed two 
follow-up calls but have not yet heard anything.  If you have any questions, 
please do not hesitate to inquire with me.

Regards,

Cindy

Do what you need to do; the system has to work.  The only question I have is: 
why doesn't IT just take care of this without a charge? This is not an 
extraordinary item or special request.  This ought to be something IT simply 
takes care of without us having to get involved or pay extra.  Am I missing 
something?

Subject: New Computer for Handling Stock Awards

Steve, 

The IT group put it like this..."Justification:  Current Server is  PL1850, 
and has reached it's capacity and is non-redundant."

That means that our current system:
(1) has a slow processor
(2) is nearly out of memory for stock award administration
(3) doesn't have a "real-time" back up in case the hard drives fails
(4) needs to be upgraded

The IT group has quoted about $19,000 for a new system that brings this 
server up to Enron's current server standards and takes care of the above 
issues.

Let me know if this expense is a problem and whether you need to be involved 
with these types of decisions in the future.

Thanks,
Aaron

RE: Legislative Status Report Week Ending 2/23


RECENT EVENTS:

-- The week started off on a very positive note.  Monday was a holiday!
Tuesday, however, inevitably came along to spoil all the fun with last
minute committee hearing announcements for some significant bills.

-- SB 39x (Speier) was heard this week in the Senate Energy Committee.  Thi=
s
measure would define owners or operators of any electric generating facilit=
y
as a public utility subject to the state=01,s jurisdiction.  The bill also
places the CPUC in the role of determining scheduled maintenance outages fo=
r
generation units.  Although the bill goes much further, the author=01,s onl=
y
intention is to give the CPUC a role in coordinating power plant outages,
but seems to not understand the implications of doing it in the manner
outlined in the bill.  IEP opposed the bill and testified to that end along
with CMTA, the State Chamber of Commerce, Enron, WSPA, and the California
Cogeneration Council.  The usual cast of consumer groups supported the bill=
.
Of particular note during the hearing was the hostility shown to the
opposition by the Chair of the Committee, Senator Bowen.  The message from
the opposition clearly was ignored by the majority of the members as it
passed out of the committee on a party-line vote.  IEP is currently
reassessing its strategy on this particular issue because this is not the
only bill that proposes similar changes.

-- The Assembly Natural Resources Committee, chaired by Asm. Howard Wayne,
was scheduled this week to hear two siting bills.  The first was AB 34x (La
Suer), which would make various changes to the CEC siting process, includin=
g
some IEP-sponsored language.  IEP has a support if amended position on the
bill which has some technical and policy problems, but workable.  Last
minute amendments offered by Asm. Keeley forced Asm. La Suer to postpone a
hearing on the bill until next Monday (2/26).  However, because the Keeley
amendments basically gut the current language and turn it into a study bill=
,
La Suer is unlikely to accept them and, according to the negative committee
analysis, the committee is unlikely to approve the measure in its current
form.

AB 36x (Wright), on the other hand, passed the Natural Resources committee
with only one =01&no=018 vote.  AB 36x would provide expedited siting for a
repower project, as defined.  However, despite IEP=01,s efforts to get the =
bill
amended, the current language would help few, if any, repower projects.  Th=
e
author has agreed to continue working with us, the environmental community
and the CEC to develop language that works for everyone.  IEP=01,s major is=
sue
at this point is that is should actually work.  The measure was double
referred to the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee and will b=
e
heard there next.

-- The negotiated language on the QF issue finally has a vehicle, SB 47x
(Battin).  All stakeholders are not united in their complete support for th=
e
measure.  IEP has may need some additional changes but will be mobilizing
members on Monday to educate Senators on the bill and support the measure i=
n
the Senate Energy Committee when it is scheduled for a hearing.  Both SCE
and WSPA also have some outstanding issues, but only WSPA so far will be
opposing the bill.

-- SB 6x (Burton), which would establish and state power and financing
authority, passed off the Senate Floor 24 to 14 this week and is headed to
the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee next. IEP met with
Senator Burton=01,s staff this week to talk about amendments to SB 6x relat=
ing
to limiting the Authority=01,s eminent domain powers.  Staff was open to wh=
at
we had to say but we have little confidence our recommendations will move
forward with the bill.  Regardless, IEP will continue to push for amendment=
s
on the Assembly side.

-- SB 33x (Burton), which would require the Governor=01,s plan to purchase =
the
IOU=01,s transmission to be approved first by the Legislature, is still
awaiting consideration on the Senate floor.

-- The Governor had another press conference today to provide a status on
the negotiations between the state and the three IOUs regarding the purchas=
e
of the utilities=01, transmission system.  Reuters is saying there the Gove=
rnor
has a deal with SCE to purchase its share of the power grid for $2.76
billion.  Negotiations are still going on with PG&E and SDG&E.  More
information on press conference can be found on the Governor=01,s web site.

--  Attached is the most recent legislative tracking report which includes
all the special session bills introduced through yesterday.  Please let me
know if you need copies of any of these bills.

I like it.  Do you think we could aggregate information regarding EES' demand 
side management opportunities and prepare a release announcing the results of 
those efforts?  Normally, we wouldn't do such an announcement without a 
specific deal to report, but in light of the special circumstances in 
California perhaps we should consider it.

The CEC is scheduled to vote tomorrow on ENA's Pastoria project.  The 
attached news release has been prepared in anticipation of CEC approval of 
the project.  Although the CEC will issue its own release, ENA's release 
references the Pittsburg project and also our other plans for generation in 
the state (which will give us a chance of better coverage from California 
reporters).  If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know by 10 
a.m. Wednesday.

Thank you.

When we talked about me speaking at the conference in Nov. Enron's management 
conference had not yet been scheduled.  Now it has and, of course, it 
conflicts... it also conflicts out just about every other senior person at 
Enron.  I will take care of finding a substitute, but wanted your thoughts on 
a couple of candidates:  how about Seabron Adamson, Richard Tabors or Scott 
Magrane(sp?).  The latter is at Goldman Sachs and, last time I talked to him, 
was working on Transcos.

Let me know what you think and let me know who you were working with at FEBA 
so I can take care of the problem.
Thanks

Steve, 

Sorry for the delay in tracking down this rumor on a potential ad campaign.
I left a message with Maureen this afternoon and subsequently talked with
Smith's staff person.  She said she was not aware of any ad campaign but she
would talk with the Senator about it when he is back on Monday. 

Have a good weekend and I will call you on Monday.

I'm ok from a pr and govt affairs standpoint, but we can't move forward until 
we have legal (including FCPA) approval.  I have exchanged voicemails with 
Elizabeth Labonowski on this and she is on it.  If you have consulted local 
counsel on the issue you should put that person in touch with Elizabeth.
Once we have the approvals we can proceed on verbal OKs and document later 
(as we have in other cases).

This issue has come up before in Europe.  The first time through is the  
hardest and slowest.  After we have run all the traps once, the subsequent 
requests move faster.  But we have to get it right.  Even in Europe, where 
our contributions were small and routine, we attracted a bunch of attention 
just because of who we are (as in Japan Enron attracts alot of attention in 
Europe -- even where other American companies don't).

		 Subject: Urgent - political function

Steve, the purpose of this note is to get your sign off on attending a 
cocktail function to be held by a senior Japanese political figure this 
evening. Timing for approval is at issue.

We have been invited by Mr Kamei a senior political figure in the LDP to 
attend a cocktail party this evening. The price is Y20,000 (about $190) per 
head and we were proposing to send two people. My rough estimate is that half 
of each ticket would go to the LDP ie a total of $190. We have been 
developing a good relationship with the LDP through Kamei and most recently, 
he assisted us in arranging a meeting for Ken Lay with the MITI minister. 
Accordingly the purpose of attending is to maintain good relations with the 
Japanese Government with a view assisting to further Enron Japan's business 
interests in Japan. It would be viewed negatively if we were not to attend.  

We have external legal counsel sign-off that this type of function is legal 
in Japan. The function also has the support of Joe Hirl. I am aware that 
there is a procedure for political donations, however, given the number of 
Enron hands that the application needs to pass through, we will not have 
approval in time for this evening. Hence this note.

Through the course of today, I will seek to get the application approved 
through Mark Schroeder and John Sherriff and on its way to  Elizabeth 
Labanowski and then to you. As mentioned, Elizabeth is unlikely to get the 
application until after the function this evening. In the meantime, I would 
be grateful if you read this email this evening if I could have your 
preliminary OK.

kind regards

$500 sponsor.  Congressman Edwards has been very helpful with our defense 
procurement issues, and we have contributed to him recently.  The 
Congressman's main request was to include Ken Lay's name on their invitation 
which Ken Lay graciously agreed to do so the Congressman is most pleased.  
Thus, the remaining request to attend and give additional money is up to you, 
although if we have room in our budget and Ken Lay or Tom White were 
available, I would recommend their attendance.

Joe,

Although I don't have his bio, I've known Herve Joanjean for about 10 years.
He has served in the EU mission t the WTO as a mid level market access
negotiator and in Brussels mostly on industrial goods market access
negotiations.  His move to Madelin's job is a lateral one from the
industrial goods side to the services side of DG-Trade.

In the mid 90s, I worked with Herve quite a bit and found him to be
trustworthy and conscientious.  He was a pleasure to work with, and although
we will miss having Robert in the Services position, Herve is a good
replacement.

Bob Vastine reports that Robert Madellin will be moving from the Services
portfolio this fall to Agriculture and some other high sounding
responsibility. He is being succeeded by Herve Jouanjean with Michel Servoz
as number 2. Does anyone have biographical information on Herve
Jouanjean???

Andrew Buxton who heads the European Services Network will be here for
meetings with CSI and ISACs this week and also in NYC with CSI and
Japaneese counterparts. Bob told me that Vivendi is the only energy
interest involved as members of Andrew's group and they have expressed no
interest in liberalized energy services. This would seem to be an
opportunity for the UK electricity association to advise him of their
interests and possibly the drilling people.

During the ISAC 13 meeting last week, USTR Peter Collins reported that the
WTO Working Party Dealing With China's accession had expressed concern with
the recent negotiation in which the Chineese won a series of exemptions and
in the case of energy services and possibly e-commerce there are price
controls.  We were told that a number of law firms in Washington are
opposing any USTR acceptance of this provision and Bob Vastine informed
ISAC 13 members should they have a view on price controls.

Trade Ministers will meet in September and are likely to ratify the China
accession regardless of the WTO Working Group issues.  You need to let us
know if Enron should consider filing a statement regarding price controls
for energy services and e-commerce services.

Joe

		 Subject: Greening the Enron Building Mtg

Wanted to give you brief feedback on our efforts to become the 1st Fortune 
500 Company that has a 100% green headquarters.  We've established a 
company-wide team and a working plan going forward, which includes:

1.  EES commodity team is going to run the numbers for energy commodity for 
facilities and give them a proposal by end of next week.  While facilities 
will not be part of the TX pilot, EES can arrange a financial deal for them 
w/ an option of going physical on 1/1/02.   EES commodity team will also let 
the group know of the offer, in order to structure the REC deal.  Depending 
upon the savings that EES can offer to Facilities, we will determine any 
"headroom" for REC purchases.
Note: It is not necessary for Facilities to sign a commodity deal w/ EES in 
order for the "greening" of the building to go forward.  The RECs can be 
purchased and retired irrespective of the commodity deal with EES.  HOWEVER, 
it would be optimum for Facilities to sign on w/ EES and use the cost savings 
toward purchase of the RECs.  Facilities stated intent to do the latter.
2. Michael Payne and Mike Curry are going to be working on determining a cost 
for the RECs.  Michael initially projected $250,000 per year for the 
requisite number of RECs to retire commensurate w/ the demand of the 
building.  This was at a cost of $8 per REC, which I believe is quite high.  
I think they'll go for a $1-4 dollar range, bringing the cost down to a max 
of $125,000.  There's several ways to slice this end.  We can provide some of 
the RECs from the EWC facility and buy other RECs from the market in order to 
minimize the cost impact of the REC purchases.
3.  Next Thursday we will be able to get more of an exact figure on the 
premium cost for the RECs (ie how much over the cost savings will the RECs 
cost).  We will then need to decide the following:
 a. Would Corp/EHS being will to pitch in to cover any additional cost for 
the RECs;
 b. Pitching the idea to Skilling for buyoff, and payment for the RECs;
 c. Possibly getting buyoff from the business units since this could change 
what they are currently paying for power.
4. We discussed all of the above with Peggy Mahoney, and she asked us to take 
a stab at a comprehensive press release announcing all of the bells and 
whistles on the new building and our being the 1st Fortune 500 company to go 
100% green in our headquarters.   Catherine McKalip Thompson is working on 
the first draft.  We need to determine if we can get the "best" press for 
this commitment (i.e. stories in the WSJ and NY Times).  We determined that 
the message would need to be targeted, specifying the terms of our 
commitment....i.e. Enron makes a commitment for 3 years to provide 100% green 
for its headquarters in Houston, making it the first Fortune 500 company 
to.......

The goal is to have a final plan and decision by April 20th when Steve speaks 
to high level executives at a prelude to Earth Day NY on the topic of Energy 
Shock--Crisis or Opportunity: Building Economics and the Environment.

Mike, we'll definitely need your continued support and assistance, 
particularly if this goes to Skilling.  I'll keep you posted on the progress.

You are invited to a meeting next Thursday (3/22) afternoon at 2:00 to 
discuss energy commodity and renewable energy credits for the Enron Building, 
Center and Stadium.  There are a few efforts that are going on simultaneously 
and I thought it would be a good idea for all of us to meet and get on the 
same page.  As many of you might know, Enron Wind (Michael Payne) and ENA 
(Mike Curry) have a great proposal to retire renewable energy credits from 
our Enron Wind facility to match the consumption of the building and stadium 
(details attached below).  If this proposal goes forward, Enron would be the 
1st Fortune 500 company to "go green" in its headquarters building.  Couple 
this w/ our energy star award, and we have GREAT environmental messaging.   
We'd like to highlight this announcement on Earth Day (April 22nd).

The facilities folks are interested in switching from Reliant to EES for 
actual commodity.  It makes sense to work strategically together on win-win 
proposal that will not only make sense economically, but that we can use in 
our messaging.  The focus of the meeting is to discuss the various proposals, 
and steps for moving forward.   

The meeting will be in EB50MO3 from 2:00-3:00. Please let me know if you or 
someone from your group can attend.

Subject: Duke Energy proposes to manage SDG&E's entire electricity load for 
five years


The note below was sent to the 20 or so reporters that I have been working
with on the CA electricity crisis.

FYI.

Below is a press release we distributed today that details a proposal we
have made to San Diego Gas & Electric to manage their entire electricity
load (up to 3,300 megawatts) for five years at a fixed price of $60 a
megawatt hour.  The proposal was detailed in our comments to the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission on their recent proposed solutions to
Caifornia.

As the release indicates, forward contracting for electricity is a very
effective way for the state's utilities to manage the volitility in the
state's electricity markets.  With natural gas prices more than doubling
since last year and last week being up to seven times higher than last year
on the spot market (up to $19 a million BTU vs. an average of about $2.50
in 1999), we feel that its imperative for utilities to take advantage of
these contracts so they can manage their own risk  exposure and their
customer's risk exposue to this volitility and the associated high prices.
(The price of natural gas represents about 90 percent of our plant's
operating costs).

We signed a forward power contract with PG&E Oct. 30 and Southern Cal
Edison Nov. 15 (announced for the first time in the this release).  The
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission strongly encourages these kind of
contracts -- and we hope that we, or other wholesale power marketers, can
do more of this kind of business with these utilities and SDG&E in the very
near future to bring stability to the state's wholesale electricity market.

Our proposal is detailed on pages eight and nine in the FERC filing, which
also includes our other positions on the California electricity crisis.
These are also detailed on our CA web site at
www.Duke-Energy.com/California.

For more information, call me at 805-595-4270 or page me at 877-364-5170.

Subject: Draft Organizational Announcement about Japan


May I please have your comments if any on this draft by close of business 
Wednesday.  We hope to have agreed on the Q&A's by then and to send it out 
the announcement on Thursday.

John

To be sent to:  All Enron Europe, all employees in Japan,  all Global Markets 
and all VPs and up around the company

Enron has established several wholesale businesses in Japan in the last year 
including Metals,  Power Plant Development (via our investment in EnCom),  
Coal,  LNG & Weather.   We see significant opportunities in each of these 
businesses and we will continue to expand our presence in Japan in order to 
capture these opportunities.  However, while Japan continues to make progress 
towards a liberalized electricity market, significant barriers to power 
trading remain under the current interim market structure.  Until further 
tangible steps are taken to improve third party access for electricity in 
Japan, we will suspend our power marketing efforts and focus on the 
significant opportunities that currently exist in our other wholesale 
businesses. [Any statement regarding our existing power sales commitment?]  
Once the necessary regulatory changes have been completed we expect to 
aggressively pursue Enron's traditional position as the leading buyer and 
seller of electricity in every deregulated market.  

We are making a number of organization changes in order to better align our 
resources with the opportunities in the Japanese market.  [deleted text] Joe 
Hirl our President of Enron Japan will move to the Global Markets group and 
lead a team that will focus on developing all our Global Markets 
opportunities in Japan especially Weather,  Oil,  LNG,  Coal, and 
Shipping.    We expect to continue our general recruiting  of Japanese 
nationals and as President of Enron Japan,  Joe will continue to provide the 
overall business leadership to both recruiting and the Analyst and Associate 
program in Japan.  The Finance origination team headed by Jeremy Thirsk will 
continue to report to Joe and also move to Global Markets.  Our power trading 
group led by Morton Erik Pettersen will transition into other roles around 
Enron.  The Equity/FX/Interest rate team which is a part of Global Markets 
has two employees in the Tokyo office today and they expect to expand their 
efforts throughout the year.

The EnCom group, which is our power plant development business (with minority 
partners) and headed by Carey Sloan will continue its efforts in developing 
power plants in Japan.  We are pleased with the progress we are making on a 
number of sites and EnCom will continue to report to the Enron Europe Office 
of the Chairman.

Our Metals team headed by Kazunari Sugimoto will continue to report through 
Enron Metals in London.

By May we expect Enron Credit to have two to three employees in Tokyo pursing 
the Credit Derivative business.  These employees remain in  Enron Credit , a 
part of Enron Europe.

EBS has two employees headed by Jim Weisser and this team expects to expand  
by year end.

The Industrial Markets team also expects to have two employees in the Tokyo 
office in the next couple of months.

In the last seven months the commercial support services for Japan have been 
transitioned to London for support and this is not changing.  Jane McBride 
heads the legal team and will continue to functionally report  to Mark Evans, 
General Counsel in London.   The RAC function will continue to report to Ted 
Murphy, head of RAC for Enron Europe.   The Risk Management and Accounting 
team is headed by Jan-Erland Bekeng will continue to functionally report to 
Fernley Dyson in London.  The  IT, HR,  Tax and real estate teams will also 
continue to functionally report to London. 

Nick O'Day who heads the Public Affairs group (Government & Regulatory 
Affairs and the Public Relations) in Japan will report to the Enron Europe 
Office of the Chair with a Public Relations functional reporting to Jackie 
Gentle in London and a Government Affairs functional reporting to Rick 
Shapiro in Houston.   We anticipate that his team's efforts will be primarily 
directed to supporting the EnCom power plant development team but they will 
also continue to provide support for Global Markets, EBS & Industrial Markets.

We have already made considerable progress in breaking into the Japanese 
markets across a wide range of Enron businesses and we anticipate that this 
will provide significant profit growth for years to come. Through these 
current changes we can demonstrate our ability to be flexible and target our 
resources where they will realise the most immediate value for the company.

One of the things you should include in your report to Koenig and Frevert is 
our preliminary views on the RTO filings.  Perhaps it's simply that we are 
not going to be satisfied until FERC forces nondiscriminatory access and we 
will object to every filing and fight every shortcoming.

		 Subject: Commodity Futures Act - Talking Points

Tori:  We have contacted Senator Gramm and Majority Leader Armey about the 
calls from Ken on Monday.  Because of the uncertainty of the Congressional 
schedule, both offices told us to call on Monday morning to schedule the 
call.  If Ken wants to make the calls unscheduled, we expect Armey and Gramm 
to both be in DC by Monday morning.

The numbers are as follows:

Senator Gramm  (202) 224-2934
Majority Leader Armey (202) 225-4000

Here are the talking points

** CONFIDENTIAL **

Talking Points on Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000

Background:

We have hit an impasse on the CFTC Reauthorization legislation.  On legal 
certainty, nearly all interested parties agree.  However, Senator Gramm 
continues to raise objections unrelated to legal certainty for our business.  
There are two issues (which we understand have primarily been advanced by 
Senator Gramm, one on bank products and one on SEC jurisdiction). Majority 
Leader Dick Armey is trying to gain consensus with the interested parties 
which include Senator Gramm, the Chairmen of the House Agriculture, Commerce, 
and Banking Committees, as well as the Department of Treasury, CFTC, and 
SEC.  Meetings are occurring on a daily basis, but little concrete progress 
has been made since draft legislation was released on October 9.     



Talking Points:

We need your help to resolve outstanding differences so that the Commodities 
Futures Modernization Act of 2000 can pass this year.  There are very few 
legislative days left and movement now on this legislation is essential. Do 
not let the Congressional calendar be the enemy of gaining legal certainty 
for this dynamic and growing industry.

The current version of the legislation provides important legal certainty for 
all physical commodity transactions (not including agricultural commodities) 
entered into on a counterparty-to-counterparty basis or on an electronic 
trading facility.  We strongly support these provisions.

The legislation eliminates concerns that our derivatives transactions may be 
illegal or that our online platforms may be unregulated futures exchanges.  
These provisions allow our businesses to grow and innovate.  Without this 
legislation the industry will be crippled with legal uncertainty and these 
platforms will develop overseas.  

Virtually all of the issues in this very complex legislative package have 
been resolved. We are indifferent to outstanding provisions, except to the 
extent that they impede passage of the legislation.  We cannot allow the 
great progress made to date, fail in the end.

If asked, about a possible solution to the logjam.  Answer:  Encourage 
Majority Leader Armey, Senator Gramm, and Secretary Summers to meet 
immediately to finalize the remaining issues.  Given time constraints, if 
such a meeting does not occur in the next few days, there may not be enough 
time to pass this important legislation.

Note: Congress will be going out on either October 20 or October 27.

It has come to my attention that there has been some confusion regarding the 
Lobbying Questionnaire that I sent out on Feb. 20, 2001 and which is due on 
March 9, 2001.  Please note that it is NOT necessary to gather your expenses 
attributable to your lobbying activities rather I just need an allocation of 
your time/hours spent engaging in such activity during the year 2000.  I 
apologize for any confusion.  Thank you - Tara Rafter

Subject: new contract

The contract Mark gave me to review yesterday only covers monthly salary.  I 
had expected there to be some discussion/reference to long-term comp plan.  
Mark had mentioned that what he gave me did not deal with certain non-compete 
payments owed to me in 2000, so I am not looking for that, but I did think he 
had said that there was something in the doucment re:long-term, which I 
cannot find.  Please advise if I am missing something.  I will withhold other 
comments for now, except to note that the draft was dated 13 March, and had a 
14 day period before expiry (now passed), and will assume that that is an 
irrelevancy.  Look forward to hearing from one of you. mcs

The first meeting relative to the SB 27x fix to the suspension of da 
contained in AB 1x was held at the Capitol today.  Present were ESPs, 
consumer groups, business interests, the utlities and representatives from 
the Department of Finance, the DWR and Finance's Bond Counsel.  The meeting 
was led by Laurence Lingbloom from Senator bowen's office.

Aaron Thomas led off with an articualtion of the AReM/business coalition 
proposal. Successive presentations were given by interests who submitted 
either correspondence or draft proposals- the details of which can be 
discussed in tomorrow's conference call.

Of particular note, and the greatest obstacle facing the future of da, was 
the presentation by the attorney representing the Dept. of Finance.  He 
expressed concern over broad exemptions from exit fees (ie: all residential 
and small commercial customers < 100kw) and broad authority to opt out will 
make it extremely difficult to actually sell the bonds.  

We need to follow up with Finance, their counsel and DWR to allay their 
fears- the sooner the better.  We need to be able to speak their language on 
bonding particulars and we need to be able to articulate our position in 
terms relavant to their bonding requirements.  We can discuss this further in 
the call tomorow.

Finally, Lingbloom said he will circulate a proposal of his own by midweek 
next.  The general tenor at the conclusion of the meeting was not good- we 
have our work cut out for us.

Until tomorrow.

		 Subject: Meeting with Governor Davis, need for additional 
comments/suggestions

We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA.  In attendance were Ken Lay, 
the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. 
spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his 
ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next 
week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  
Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on 
my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff 
Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our 
proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation 
based on the governor's comments:

Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that 
we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing 
communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to 
go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what 
the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more 
work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He 
talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail 
level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the 
benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he 
would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power 
(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented 
solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix 
the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.
Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also 
included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed 
interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a 
goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities 
to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate 
analysts and other "nonadvocates" to develop solutions to a number of issues 
including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  
He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas 
purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding 
some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.
His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously 
under serious consideration and some of which were mere "brainstorming".  
Some of these ideas would require legislative action.
State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of 
generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that 
they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This 
was a frequently recurring theme.
Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus 
basis to consumers.
Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in 
California.
State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more 
widely deploy distributed generation.
Expand in-state gas production.
Take state lands gas royalties in kind.
negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for 
addtional gas supplies.
Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant 
maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at 
any one time.
Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.
Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear 
more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be 
able to help out here).
Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made 
some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy 
some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation 
thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control 
approach with generators.
Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.
To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's 
thoughts and get them to Kari)
He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- 
not just the 5 one year strips.
He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.
He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the 
deal.
He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the 
forward contracting issues.
Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.

The current schedule contemplates sending a draft of the Disclosure Schedules 
to Skadden by the end of the day on Friday.  Please provide any remaining 
comments to the draft Schedules as soon as you can.  I realize there will 
still be some holes, as we continue to negotiate the Purchase and Sale 
Agreement.  No doubt it would help to have the Appendices to the Purchase and 
Sale Agreement completed, or say maybe a dollar amount or two completed in 
the Definitions section.  Thanks for all the help.  Lance.

Thank you.  I enjoyed the discussion very much.  The DoD has significant 
challenges, but if the group participating in the meeting was any indication, 
they have some first rate people working on those challenges.  If I can be of 
further assistance, do not hesitate to call.

Subject: Highlands Forum Wrap-up

Dear Steve:  just a brief note to say thank you again for your excellent
presentation at last week's Highlands Forum.  I believe that your remarks,
along with those of Goran Lindahl, Dick Foster, and Phil Condit of Boeing,
have caused a significant stir in the preparation for the congressionally
mandated Quadrennial Defense Review and the Secretary's transformation
planning.  I also can tell you that the feedback from participants regarding
your briefing has been terrific.

We are reviewing all the material this week to begin the process of
re-creating the session on the Secretary's webpage for the Forum, and I will
be going over the video and audio clips for posting.  Recognizing that your
slides were proprietary, it would be most valuable if we could post as much
of your powerpoint briefing as possible--whatever you feel comfortable with
sharing.  Whatever that turns out to be, if your staff could email that to
me, I will make sure that only that, and not the original that you sent to
me, gets posted.

I am not sure where the senior leadership of the DoD will be going in the
coming months, however, I know that the discussion of your experience at
Enron and the experiences of your panel mates will have an influence.

A more formal letter of thanks will be forthcoming, but for now, thank you
again for joining us and helping to make this a memorable and most important
Highlands Forum.

Best regards, Dick

Dear Ken,
 Federico Sada, who is travelling with President elect Vicente Fox in South 
America, called me this morning, 
and asked me to give you the confirmed list of attendees to the dinner in New 
York, Wednesday August 23, 8:00 P.M.
at the Watteau Room of the St. Regis Hotel:

 Sanford I. Weill   Citigroup, Inc.   Chairman and CEO
 Hendrick Verfaille  Monsanto Co.   President and CEO
 William B Harrison, Jr.  Chase Manhattan Corp.  Chairman and CEO
 Raymond V. Gilmartin  Merck and Company, Inc. Chairman and CEO
 Michael Armstrong  AT&T    Chairman and CEO
 Stephen M. Wolf  US Airways   Chairman and CEO
 Kenneth L. Lay   Enron Corp.   Chairman and CEO

Pending confirmation
 Douglas A. Warner III  J.P. Morgan   Chairman

According to Federico, if there is any late cancellation, no one will be 
substituted. Also, there is a small possibility that
the dinner could take place in Washington, rather than N.Y., based on Fox's 
meeting with President Clinton; they are still
working on the final agenda. 
 
 Max and myself are working on the background information that you will need, 
and will keep you posted of any 
changes; best regards,  jaime____

I frankly don't see Enron Europe getting $12,000 per month value from 
"Environment" nor "Environmental policy and compliance". I have raised with 
the Washington office why someone there is apparently following European 
environmental legislation and policy, when such things can only directly 
affect Enron Europe's business. I see that PR get hit with more than twice 
this amount to pay for our "Chief Environmental Officer". By copy I'm asking 
RIck Shapiro's view; we could obviously take the question up direct with 
Steve Kean.

Doug may wish to comment on the international project finance allocation, 
also from Washington.

We need to schedule a review with you of the May indicative expenditure 
report. Would late pm on 29th be convenient?

I think Paul Kaufman made the call on this from Steve Keanes' shop. I
think it was the right call, given the complexity of the regulatory issues
involved. >> Larry L Izzo at ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 12/08 12:28 PM >>>

Peggy, we had wanted to add NEPCO to the bid list of bidders for the EPC
bid for the Cayote II Project.  Greg Piper has informed me that PGE is of
the opinion that we cannot even have NEPCO participate in the bid because
PGE does not think that would be able to get by the regulators.

Before accepting this as fact, can you confirm that we can not even 
participate in the bid process because NEPCO is an affiliate of Enron.  It 
seems that the best interest of the rate payers is in getting a winning 
competitive bid.  Are affiliates precluded from competitive bids in this 
process?

Again, I don't want to accept a no without insuring that it's absolutely 
necessary.  Thanks for your help.

		 Subject: CFTC Chair

Jim Newsome is currently the Interim Chair of the Commodities Futures Trading 
Commission (CFTC).  He was appointed in 1998 to term which expires in June 
2001.  Commissioner Newsome visited Enron in 1999 and will again visit Enron 
to meet with Jeff Skilling (also EnronOnLine executives) on March 6, 2001.

The CFTC has 5 Commissioners.  Commissioners Newsome and Spears are 
Republicans and Commissioners Erickson and Holum are Democrats, with one 
opening.  If Newsome becomes Chair, then there will be two open seats.  If 
Newsome if passed over, there will only be open seat. 

Commissioner Newsome has the support of Majority Trent Lott.  He is well 
liked in industry because of his free market philosophy and belief in 
competition and deregulation.  While not a technical expert, he is a "known 
quantity" at the Commission.  Newsome played a major role in the Commodities 
Futures Modernization Act (CFMA) which became law last Congress.  This law 
brought legal certainty and modernization to the commodity trading 
community.  With Newsome, industry is consulted before regulations are 
issued.  Industry generally believes that Commission Newsome is the right 
candidate to oversee the CFMA rulekmaking which is currently underway.

The other candidate for the position was former North Carolina Senator Lauch 
Faircloth whose nomination was being championed by Senator Phil Gramm 
(R-TX).  We have learned that Faircloth has lost interest, because he would 
have to divest sizeable interest in agriculture holdings.  The concern now is 
that because this is a third tier appointment,  unknown candidates will 
suddenly appear without industry input.  A quick nomination and confirmation 
of Commissioner Newsome as Chairman is recommended by many in the industry.

Do you think it appropriate to have Ken Lay raise this nomination with the 
transition team?

Steve,

Caught your performance on C span over the weekend by accident covering the
Senate hearings last Wednesday. You did a great job. I think Sen Murkowski
gets it, but many of the others clearly do not. 

I know it's a little late but wanted to thank you for your informative
comments at our Senior managers meeting last November in California. This
energy situation really has our CEO's attention and we are considering the
formation of a new industrial users coalition to promote sound comprehensive
energy policy. Just users. 

If you're in Washington and have some spare time, which neither of us ever
do, it would be great to have a lunch or something. As you know, we are
active on the hill and at FERC and DOE. On most issues, I am sure our
positions are the same.

Again, thank for your help with our Senior management. Hope to see you again
sometime.

I think it's a good document and carves out some solid policy ground for 
Bush.  I think the electricity section needs some additions though.  There is 
not a lot that the current administration can do about siting new plants and 
power lines -- its largely a state and local decision.  Further, the problem 
has been less about government failing to provide adequate incentives to 
utilities than it has been about a failure of the current commission to 
opening the grid on a nondiscriminatory basis.  Once utilities are in the 
open access transmission business they will look for ways to invest in the 
grid and stop getting in the way of independent power producers who want to 
connect to the grid.  The answer is open access, so power can get from where 
it is to where it is needed.  This has been clear for a long time, yet the 
current administration (and its appointees on FERC) have yet to use their 
authority to make this happen.  The result: spiking prices and reliability 
problems.

Joe:

Thanks again for coming to Houston this week.

CNN has a compelling brand and we believe that a number of the components of 
your proposal are worth exploring further.

However, we are not interested in pursuing discussions of the exclusive 
sponsorship.

I want to stress, though, that many of the elements of the package you and 
David presented are of interest and we would like to continue discussions 
with you.

Please get in touch with us to discuss how we proceed from here.

Thanks again.

Joe,

As you are probably aware, Jim Hoecker is considering leaving FERC
relatively soon.  The President will then name a new Chairman.  Bill Massey
is quite interested in receiving the nomination.

Please call to discuss.

Do we have someone who works for us now who was at Transredes when the 
government owned it and could help us do a comparison between our respective 
environmental records?  It seems to me that even though we are having our 
share of problems, we have probably had fewer problems than the government 
did and have probably been more responsive and thorough in our clean up 
efforts.   Obviously, we would need to be judicious about how we used such 
information (we don't want to aggravate the government), but having such an 
analysis may be helpful in showing the progress made and in discouraging 
overly punitive action by the government.  What do you think?

An important conference call is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. (PST) on Sunday, 
Today, Jan 21 to discuss the status of legislative meetings on QF/SRAC 
matters.

Status Report
After a marathon 12 hour meeting with Assemplyman Keeley, Senator Battin, QF 
Parties, and SCE, a Keeley sponsored "deal" was proposed at 3:30 a.m. this 
morning.  The crux of the deal is as follows:
 
For renewables and non-gas fired QF, essentially ...
 
7.8 cents/kwh for delivered power for 5 years ["all in", i.e. includes 
capacity and energy]
1.0 on losses
no 'clawback' for wind resources which may have failed to meet fixed capacity 
obligations in the past
Applies "going forward" (presumedly Feb. 1)
 
 
For gas-fired QFs...
 
7.8 cents/kwh for five years, assuming gas is $5.60;  payment will 
increase/decrease tied to gas  (this assumes an IER of 9821)
1.0 on line losses
applies "going forward"
Caacity True-up and "forbearance" were not addressed.  Credit worthiness will 
be address in the technical conference scheduled for later today (Sunday).  
This program will require in part legislative blessing and direction, 
followed by CPUC approval of individual contract amendments.  This is 
essentially the PG&E/QF "deal" for the gas guys.  For the renewables, it is 
more of a fixed payment approach.
 
A "Technical Conference" is scheduled for Sunday (today) in Sacramento to 
work out some of the implementing details.

Interesting info for those of you who follow or have an interest in this type 
of data regarding succes of market liberalisation.  Further interesting to 
note that household prices fell in Sweden and Finland, markets that already 
had liberalised wholesale markets, after furhter market opening to 
residential secotr.  Note fall in German prices, which, despite bad access 
regime, ended up with a suicidal competition in the wholesale market by 
incumbents.  Let me know if you need more/have any questions.   mcs

I think I can recommend that the time be set aside, but it would be helpful 
if we pointed out to Emerson that it must be clear that there is a clear 
opportunity for Enron before we schedule the meeting.  Maybe you could use 
this to get some progress on a bundled outsource deal.

		 Subject: RE: Dates for Emerson Meeting

Gentlemen:

Situation:

Emerson is aggressively seeking at least a three hour time slot for a meeting 
with Jeff Skilling in April or May 2001.  Mr. Skilling's office is hesitant 
to allocate more than two hours without your recommendation.  Emerson is 
being persistent.

The key players from Emerson are David Farr, newly appointed CEO, and James 
Berges, President and effectively the leader of Emerson's strategic 
development effort.  It is anticipated that both would attend the meeting.

Emerson execs want to (i) get to know Mr. Skilling and other senior 
management, (ii) discuss mutual business opportunities, and (iii) hold a 
discussion about the transformation of Enron from a pipeline company to its 
current form.  The last point has to do with Emerson's continuing 
self-transformation effort and how Enron achieved its transformation.

I need your advice and recommendation.  Please respond by e-mail or telephone 
(x5-4040).


Background:

Emerson initiated this latest round of contact with Enron in November 2000, 
when Mike Train and Mark Proudfoot, both Emerson VPs of Corporate 
Development, visited the Enron building hosted by Steve Kean.  I met them at 
that time.

Since that initial meeting, Emerson has aggressively pursued a business joint 
venture as preferred supplier with Martin Wenzel and the distributed power 
business, I believe with promising results.  My sense is that Emerson is 
uniquely positioned as EES' partner in that business.  I am waiting to 
receive an update from Martin.

Emerson is also interested in becoming a preferred supplier for EES's DSM 
business.  While we generally support that idea, we are pressing Emerson to 
reciprocate by becoming a customer of our bundled outsource business.  
Emerson is highly decentralized, and our efforts to date have been 
unsuccessful.

I want to use the meeting as an opportunity to press Emerson to consider a 
proposal from EES's bundled outsource business.

Please let me know your recommendation on this matter.

Thanks,

Nate

Nate,

Thanks for the note - - I have dropped some ideas to Thad to follow up on
during my absence from the office.

I am a little nervous about having only two hours - - is it possible to get
a larger block of time to get to know each other better and talk through
some of the mutual business opportunities?

That flight time is fine.  A couple of other things:  I need to meet with 
McKinsey while I'm in town on Monday.  Please set up with Suzanne Nimocks' 
office.  Also, my return should be first thing Tuesday morning (I think we 
had discussed Monday night originally).  Just get me on the first available 
flight to Roswell.

Also, I didn't mean to put you in  a difficult spot with Melissa.  I had 
tried getting hold of her last night but only got the answering machine.  
Don't worry about tellling her my travel schedule.  If I haven't told her 
first, I'll deal with the consequences (I've logged "couch time" before plus 
I'm usually pretty good about keeping her up to date).

It turns out that the co. plane flight from Roswell to Houston only takes a 
little over an hour.

We currently have it scheduled for:

  Depart  Roswell at 7:00 p.m (MST) on Sunday 11/19/00
 
  Arrive Houston at 9:17 p.m. (CST)

Your HR PRC starts at 7:30 a.m. on Monday 11/20/00.

Just FYI - the co. plane will land in Roswell at 4:05 p.m. (MST) and wait for 
you.

Is the departure time at 7:00 pm ok with you?  
Do you want to leave a little later since the flight doesn't take very long?

I think it looks good.  a few suggestions though:

I haven't read the whole reprt so I can't say for sure that it alleges no 
price gouging (make sure to forward this to Jeff ... my e-mail is slow on the 
road).  We can say though, that instead of blaming generators and marketers 
the report blames the structure of the market for California's woes.

I think we should shorten the quote to something like " the reprt is 
consistent with what we have said all along.

We should say that the scheduling penalties part of the order will "penalize 
utilities for underscheduling" not predicting.

Hedging is not about holding pirces down so much as it is about protecting 
people from wild price swings ... that's what allowing utilities to buy 
outside the spot should help do.

(Also, my title is just EVP and Chief of Staff)

Steve and Rick,

EES is considering "re-sourcing" the new customers in SDG&E's area -- because 
of the uncertainty over whether the CA Procurement Charge will apply to those 
customers.  I think this proposed action needs to be evaluated from a 
nationwide perspective -- this has long-term negative implications for 
Enron's credibility in the DA market as a whole.

Your DC team -  Hillings and then Briggs were instrumental in pressuring the

the regulations are 90 % ok - and better than the old ones. -  your team got 
the right pressure points and applied them well.

Steve

Thanks for stepping in and backing up for Joe Sutton on Wednesday.  I wanted 
to provide you with talking points for your speaking engagement with our new 
hire analysts during their orientation.  As a reminder, you are scheduled to 
speak over lunch on Monday, July 17 from 12:00 p.m. to 12:30 p.m. at the 
Doubletree Hotel in the LaSalle Ballroom.

Purpose of the luncheon:  Welcome the new hire analysts and impart to them 
our important this program is to Enron.

The analyst program is the ultimate pipeline of top entry-level talent, 
strategically deployed to meet anticipated business needs.  We look to this 
program to provide the company with our future business leader.
The program is a premier partner in providing exciting career challenges in 
areas of Finance, Origination/Structuring, Technology, Risk Management, Sales 
and Marketing, Trading, Valuation, and Accounting. 
The analyst program is also an avenue for providing the solid foundation of 
knowledge and skill needed in a competitive and dynamic global corporation.
We are very excited to have you on our team.  This is a very exciting company 
that is always reinventing itself.  The opportunities are endless.


There will be 75 new hire analysts attending this orientation.  Other than 
the recruiting process, this is their first impression of Enron and Senior 
Management.  The first week of their orientation will consist of 
presentations given by all business units/operating companies.  Weeks two and 
three will consist of technical training (i.e., modeling, valuation, working 
styles, communicating effectively and computer training).  Additionally, we 
have social events scheduled to allow them to network with peers and 
management.  Additionally, I have attached a calendar of the orientation for 
your review.

Steve, let me know if you require additional information.  Thank you for your 
support in our new hire orientation efforts.

Regards,
Celeste Roberts

Don't worry about it ... sorry for putting you back on speaker.  I just 
wanted Sue to hear (she enjoys utility bashing so much).  Thanks for the 
comment on the hearing.  In some respects I don't think the first panel could 
have gone much better;  everyone thanked FERC for intervening (though for 
different reasons).  The other staff reports are also looking good.  Scott 
Miller has been a godsend -- somebody not afraid to tell it like it is.

I don't think this will work.  We have offices on 50M but two are set aside 
for board members and one (the one Rob Walls recently left) is going to be 
tied up with a video crew working on the analyst meeting.

		 Subject: Calypso Tribal Letters

Friends,

The statute should be reviewed by whichever lawyer is supporting the project. 

 As I mentioned to Alice Weekley, I am unfamiliar with the recent amendments 
referenced requiring the notice for projects that do not actually cross 
reservation property. The amendment does not surprise me though. 

 In the past, for example, during the Transwestern expansion in '91, we 
developed a comprehensive NAGPRA plan with tribes whose reservations we 
crossed, yet neighboring tribes were included--the thinking by the various 
State Historic Preservation officers was that unearthed remains (bones, 
funerial objects, pottery pieces, holy objects, etc) may have belonged to 
tribes other than those from whose reservation they were ultimately 
unearthed.  It made for a VERY VERY long and complicated plan and 
consultation process....not only when objects were unearthed, but simply 
putting the required anticipatory plan and procedures in place PRIOR to 
construction.  (It gives me a chuckle: my late husband, Leonard Hilton, who 
was in charge of the TW project, is likely rolling in his own grave at the 
mere thought of Enron having to put another of these plans 
together..Haha!!)   As I said, I've not read the amendment , but hopefully it 
only legally requires 'notice'---yet, in my nearly 20 years of practicing 
law, I've rarely seen  a 'notice' that didn't crack the door or sound the 
alarm of further buerocratic opportunity!

For your further information, I have met Billie Ray Cypress personally and 
he's a decent and seemingly reasonable guy with a huge casino on the rez ; 
yet these personal attributes frequently go by the wayside when it comes to 
'perceived economic opportunity'.  
 Chief James Billie,[chief of the Seminoles, 2nd largest/2nd wealthiest tribe 
in North America] on the other hand, is shrewd in business, dictitorial in 
management, and personally , has an ego bigger than Texas, behavior to match, 
and is proud of it!! --which makes him a ton of fun to be with if he likes 
you--he wrestles alligators, writes rock and roll and "plays"in whatever 
stage opportunity is presented him--as long as he can be the center of 
attention.  The Seminoles have not only a tribal web site, James Billie has 
his own!!  Check it out--it's a hoot!!  He has been chief for about 25 years 
(and I'm guessing he's maybe in his early 50's).  The Seminoles have 
recognized significant economic development under James, but he is definitely 
a "My way or the highway" kind of guy--he loves you, hates you, or ignores 
you--and he has a tribal council that is respectfully terrified of him. If 
any activity smacks of anything James Billie doesn't like, he'll know no 
limits in stopping it...remember, this guy wrestles alligators!! No Joke!

I don't recognize the other names on the list, but I think it's clear from 
both the beurocratic issues, as well as the specific tribal issues incident 
to each affected tribe, everything associated with the process should be 
executed with all of this in mind.  I'd be happy to speak with the project's 
lawyer to discuss this further, if information beyond that set forth above 
would be helpful.

Thanks!

--Christie.

I don't want to disrupt building a more collegial relationship here, but I 
have some concerns about their reticence to sound more positive about 
reaching agreement on our two key issues.  Can we put the question 
differently:  what are the barriers to their concurrence and what can we do 
together to address those barriers?  If the barriers for EEI are 
insurmountable because of the recalcitrance of a few members, can they 
facilitate a dialogue between us and a more progressive group?

Sounds positive.  I think that both sides are realistic but willing to work 
together.  I think we need to keep this going forward.  If we let this hang 
out too long, we could lose the momentum.

Thanks for getting back to me so soon. 

I think you did a good job of summarizing our discussions, both as to content 
and context..  I fully understand what your two most important issues are and 
that you are optimistic we can come together on the other issues.  
Nevertheless, the details are important as to all of those issues.  I look 
forward to talking more both about the details and about the business 
elements that underlie our views of the issues.  I agree that whatever 
happens as to outcome, these kinds of discussions are far more beneficial 
than mutual demonization.  

 I expect to be able to talk to my principles at EEI next Monday (our 
Financial Conference is just finishing up in San Francisco - I understand 
Enron had someone there).  Once I do, I will get back to you. 

In the meantime, I 'm absorbing the California Order and would be glad to 
share impressions with you when we talk.

Ed   


>>> "Richard Shapiro" <Richard_Shapiro@enron.com> 10/31/00 03:51PM >>>


Ed- Thanks again for breakfast and for the very  good discussion we had on a
wide- ranging set of issues. Here's where I believe we ended the discussion: 
1)
On the range of issues( that were addressed in the document we forwarded to 
you
and that we worked from) that would likely be addressed next congress relative
to electricity reform, the bottom line was that while there were many issues 
on
which we voiced  our diffrences, mandatory RTO participation and
non-discriminatory access to transmission,i.e;unbundling,  are the two 
critical
issues from our perspective. While our discussion revealed the continuing
diffrences we have on the resolution of those issues and the " political"
hurdles EEI faces with certain of its members to reach consensus on them, we
both felt further meetings and continued discussion were  warranted . On the
remaining issues ( other than the two just mentioned)  for which diffrences 
were
articulated and discussed, I indicated that we fully understood your concerns
and that Enron was sufficiently flexible on those issues to have a high degree
of confidence that they would ultimately be  removed as a source of 
disagreement
between us.  Again, I come back to the two critical issues mentioned above -
those issues must be adequately addressed as laid out in our earlier document
for this process to come to fruition and for comprehensive federal legislation
to make any sense for us. With that said, remember that we were quite 
receptive
to appropriate incentives being included as part of mandatory RTO particpation
as well as to tax concerns your members must have addressed.
                                                   We also discussed the joint
CEO letter that would be sent post - election that would jointly affirm our
mutual desire to get competitive electricity markets functioning well in the
next administration  and continued to agree on the value of that effort,
                                              Next steps( my proposal):
                                                                       1) EEI
prepare first draft of CEO letter for discussion.
                         2) Schedule next meeting for more intensive 
discussion
on key issues ( 4- 6 hour meeting)
                                                                            
Ed,
thanks again for taking the time to continue the dialogue- despite the 
distance(
on issues) that still exists between our respective organizations, I feel that
this is a doable exercise if the necessary commitment is made to the process. 
No
matter the ultimate outcome, I believe that one positive result  that has and
will continue to come from this process is a better understanding of our
respective viewpoints and a recognition that the mutual  demonization that has
occoured in the past is completely counterproductive. Talk to you soon.

Despite the fact the bill, by itself, does not guarantee payment for overdue 
receivables, the QFs on today's call decided to go forward and push for SBX 
47 irrespective of the progress on SBX 33.  A press conference is planned for 
Friday by IEP.  Bowen, who heads up the first committee that this bill will 
go through will have hearings on this bill on Tuesday at the earliest.

Jan S-J asked every QF to fax to IEP a description of all QF generation and 
the zip code of each project so that they can begin lobbying specific 
legislators.  A significant PR push is planned.

SBX 47 is opposed by SCE.  PG&E's position appears more ambivalent.  One 
angle would be to try to get PG&E to support Enron's swap/SC language and 
make inclusion of such language a condition of PG&E's support.

(e.g., Washington: 28-34%; Montana: 4.5-32%; Idaho:  6.0-24%; Nevada:=20

Enron's policy is to periodically remind offices of procedures to follow for 
proper screening of mail.  If an x-ray machine is available in your office, 
all incoming mail and couriered packages should be scanned.  If no x-ray 
machine is available, you should scan you mail visually, looking for the 
following:

- Priority markings such as 'Rush', 'Personal', or 'Confidential'
- Excessive postage
- False or missing return address
- Poorly typed or handwritten address
- Incorrect titles
- Addressed to titles, but no names
- Misspellings of common words or names
- Oily stains or discolorations
- Excessive or uneven weight distribution
- Excessive tape, string or twine
- Rigid, uneven or lopsided envelope
- Protruding wires, screws, or other metal parts
- Postmark is different from the return address

The existence of only one or two of the above characteristics is acceptable, 
but more than two on the same peice of mail should be considered to be 
suspicious, and the item should not be opened.  In case of receipt of a 
'suspicious' letter or package, you should isolate the item and call your 
local police imediately.

One minor point:  the response to the first data request implies that all 
employees went through the PRC process in 2000.  I am not sure this is 
accurate.  It's fair to say that most did, but I believe that the field 
employees who are organized into self-directed work teams do not go through 
the PRC process.

Several employees have asked about the exercise policy on stock options.  
Specifically, they want to know what the exercise policy is on i) termination 
eg as a result of the prc process, ii) voluntary departure, iii) retirement, 
or iv)resignation; and to what extent do the rules vary across plans: i) 
AESOP, LTIP, deferred bonus etc.  The main focus is on the length of time to 
exercise.  I am concerned that there may be some odd incentives in the 
structure -- eg are severed employees allowed more time to exercise than 
employees who just leave voluntarily ( ie if you want to have a full three 
years to exercise options are you better off becoming a performance issue and 
getting severed than you would be if you simply left the company?

Steve - the issue to which I believe Jane is referring in the first sentence 
("confirmation of the issues which I have articulated") concern possible 
paymensts made to receive informal, and favourable, guidance, on customs 
issues (which informal opinions are now seemingly being reversed, formally).  
In some cases such payments may still be legal.  But, subject to Jane 
confirming that I am explaining this correctly (given that the communication 
below is a bit cryptic), it now seems to me to be timely (as Rebecca and Jim 
have apparently been alerted in London on Monday, per her note below) to 
satisfy yourself that we are now clean on this issue under the Foreign 
Corrupt Practices Act.  The informal customs advice was obtained by Muktesh 
Tyagi (spelling?), one of two people known as Sanjay's "fixers" (that should 
make you fell comfortable!).  You may wish to discuss with Jane further, but 
once you satisfy yourself that there is some smoke here, my thought was that 
you might want to simply confirm with Rebecca that we are running the facts 
to ground, so that we can satisfy ourselves that we are either clean, or need 
to come clean with USG.  let me know if you need more.   thanks mcs

Mark, I have confirmation of the issues on which I have articulated concern 
to you although such confirmation is verbal.  Apparently, there are more 
areas that I will identify in due time.  This information was conveyed to the 
Legal Team (which included Rebecca, Bruce, Sandeep Katwala and outside 
attorneys) in London on Monday.   In addition, below is additional bad news.  
In addition, there is at issue now the fact that the flow diagrams and import 
lists do not match.  I'll forward an additional e:mail from Seethayya,

Subject: Summary of $ at Risk for Customs

I found out more info on some of these extraneous customs issues above and 
beyond the LNG stuff:

PHASE I ISSUES
1. SPM 
 (This equipment has already been imported at 22.38%, but customs is claiming 
merit duty rates of 67%.)
 This is currently being evaluated by the courts.
 Total Value at Risk = $7 MM
2. "D" - Stream
 Are Bechtel's design charges of $66 MM specific to our equipment or to the 
project as a whole? 
 If the former, then duty of 22.38% should apply.
 Total Value at Risk = $13.5 MM  ($66 MM x 22.38%)

PHASE II ISSUES
1. Services Loading on Power Plant Equipment
 Same issue as for LNG Equipment. Currently we are paying a 10% loading on 
duty into a reserve deposit to cover this.
 Total Value at Risk = $22.38 MM  ($100 MM x 22.38%)
2. LNG Equipment to be dutied at 53.8% or 22.38%?
 Think we all know this issue.
 Total Value at Risk = $56 MM (as per Risk Matrix)
3. Services Loading on LNG Equipment
 Think we all know this issue
 Total Value at Risk = $80 MM  ($149 MM x 53.8%)

TOTAL VALUE at RISK ~$180 MM - - This is WORST, WORST CASE!

Note:  There is still this issue of goods being imported under the wrong 
classification.  Currently, this is preventing goods from being imported on 
time, which could lead to delay claims by the contractors.  It will take me 
some time to hunt down what this could cost us if the problem isn't resolved 
soon.  Pavan's estimate is that it will take a month for Site to generate

Enron Brazil To Invest $455 Million In Gas Distribution '01-'04

RIO DE JANEIRO -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) said Monday it will invest 
$455 million in its gas distribution business in Brazil from 2001 to 2004. 
Robert Gross, vice president of Enron's Brazilian unit, also said the company 
plans to spend $970 million on thermoelectric projects, but he didn't specify 
any timetables for the projects.
Gross said Enron will spend $142 million on gas distribution projects next 
year in Brazil. 
Currently, Brazil's energy regulator Aneel is in the process of licensing 
companies to build and operate a total of 44 new thermoelectric plants. 
U.S.-based Enron primarily operates in Brazil as a gas and energy 
distributor.

I agree with Mona: we need to include some customer contacts . . . it gives 
them an opportunity to look smart about going to the marketplace and getting 
price protection.

The messages need to include Palmer's top three:  1) price  caps cause 
shortages (Rob- can you put together soe historical examples?); 2) better 
solutions are already available; and 3) short term politics makes for long 
term problems.

On item 2) we need to talk about the competitive offerings to San Diego, the 
fixed price offerings available at retail, and the availability of 
conservation and demand side management technology today (including its 
availability to the consuming public from existing suppliers . . .  ie you 
don't need to wait for Enron to make a consumer offering).

Subject: Re: Price Cap Media--DRAFT  

I have a couple of suggestions on parts of the draft.

Media Action:
In addition to doing behind the scenes editorial board meetings and the like, 
I would suggest that we get our coalition lined up and ready to release 
statements for certain key events which are likely to occur over the next 
several weeks, such as:

1.  SDG&E's selection of the winning bid to their RFP.  Even if Enron isn't 
selected as the winning bid, the coalition should trumpet the market-based 
solution and the enormous market response to SDG&E's RFP.
2.  The Commission vote on UCAN's Emergency Motion.  We should be prepared to 
issue a statement whether the Cmmn votes with us or against us.  With us, the 
market can and did provide reasonable, expedient solutions to SDG&E's 
customers and protection from price spikes.  Against us, despite the 
overwhelming market response, the Cmmn chose to ignore the market solutions 
and impose more regulation.
3.  Potential for ARM members to surface a Provider of Last Resort proposal 
within the next couple of weeks.
4.  ISO Bd. Mtg-keep up pressure against reducing price caps.

Coalition Members:

Agree that those groups listed should be contacted, although the CMA, CRA, 
CIU, CLECA have been luke-warm in their advocacy.

I would add our customers (UC/CSU (especially the San Diego branch), PacTel, 
etc.)  NewEnergy has indicated that Kroger/Ralph's grocery stores, San 
Diego-based, would give testimonials.  I could solicit the members of ARM to 
identify a key customer contacts for interviews.  

We could check with our lobbyists and see who they would recommend (wine 
growers, dairy industry, etc.)  We should also consider the water agencies 
and the rural counties and the City of Pittsburg.  While the immediate 
message is responding to San Diego's situation, this latter group of 
potential coalition members would go to the larger message (keeping benefits 
of competitive markets) from a state-wide perspective.  What about the City 
of Pittsburg?

Attention: MR.  STEVE  KEAN
  MS.  CINDY  OLSON    =20

Dear Mr. Kean and Ms. Olson:

I am privileged and delighted for providing me with this opportunity of=20

The purpose of this letter is to respectfully appeal to both of you to plea=
se=20
help me continue serving Enron and continue being an active manager within=
=20
this most challenging environment, as I feel I am most qualified.

I joined Enron EE&CC on March 1, 2000; now am an EES employee. I am a=20
Mechanical Engineer, with 32 years work experience and extraordinary track=

record in the oil & gas and power generation EPC business worldwide, with=
=20
major global organizations. =20

I hold a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering (specifically in the Gas Turbines=

Technology). I have been a Project Manager, Senior Project Manager, and=20
Project Director on major multi-million Dollar onshore and offshore=20
development projects since 1980, in every hydrocarbons  producing region.

I was interviewed at Enron=01,s EE&CC in mid February 2000 pursuant to my=
=20
application for Project Manager/Senior Project Manager position. =20

I was then hired on March 1, 2000 as Project Engineering Manager (PEM), und=
er=20
quite urgent circumstances, to be in charge of all three (3) major and most=
=20
active Power Projects at EE&CC in Brazil.  Just one (1) week later, after m=
y=20
new hires orientation, I had to join a delegation and travel to Brazil for=
=20
Due Diligence of Local Engineering and Construction Contractors. =20

The Expected NTP was January 2001, and the life of these foreign Projects=
=20
(except for Electrobolt =01) simple cycle plant) is three (3) to four (4) y=
ears,=20
i.e. until the year 2003 and 2004.  These Projects are RioGen, Cuiaba II, a=
nd=20
Electrobolt.

I was attracted to Enron due to its standing and recognition in the industr=

reputation, globalization, and active market penetration.  In fact, I felt=

very fortunate to become the center of the above-mentioned challenges with=
=20
three such major Enron Power Projects.

I resigned my then current and very secure position as Senior Project Manag=

However, I am still very optimistic and hopeful that, with your kind suppor=

I have already interviewed with Messrs. Steve Meyers and Dave Roberts at EE=

I have also applied to at least fifteen (15) pertinent positions within EES=

ENA, and Enron Transportation but, unfortunately, have received no response=

Nevertheless, I am most certain that you do not want to loose a knowledgeab=

Thanks for taking the lead on this.  Note Tim's question about handicapping 
the liklihood of approval.  Prices will move in the West based on these 
odds.  We need to have a better view than anyone else.

Subject: Re: ISO Market Stabilization Plan  

Tim,  although there's always a "chance" my impression is that the FERC won't 
buy the ban on exports, as this would appear to run afoul of the Commerce 
Clause and certainly goes counter to everything that FERC hopes to accomplish 
with their own Order 888 and 2000 initiatives.  I am less certain about the 
direction FERC will go on pricing, since even the staff has recognized 
stumbling blocks in their own recommendation and offers possible variants.  

The ISO has not submitted revised tariff sheets for approval yet, so it is 
unlikely they would try to implement their own plan in the near term.  If 
they try to do so without FERC approval, possible legal avenues might include 
the filing of a complaint at FERC, asking for fast track processing (this 
"fast" is measured in weeks, not days) and/or seeking injunctive relief in 
court (faster), which can be hard to obtain but not impossible, depending 
entirely on the circumstances.

Will keep you posted if I learn anything new on this.  Ray

Subject: ISO Market Stabilization Plan

The recent plan filed at FERC is horrible.  The two most aggregious parts are 
the cost based standing bids and the ban on exports.  I know that we are 
commenting on this proposal.  I am also looking for intellegence on whether 
the ISO proposal has any chance of getting approved by FERC.  If it is not 
approved by FERC, what can the Californians do?  California has ignored FERC 
before.  If they attempt to unilaterally implement changes what is the 
likelihood that the Feds step in to intervene?  If you hear anything on this 
matter please keep me posted.  The proposed plan will have a huge impact on 
the California market and we need as much advance notice as possible.

Manager's Journal: Heir to Greatness
By Gary Hamel

09/18/2000
The Wall Street Journal
A38
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Sometime in the next few months, the board of General Electric will anoint a 
successor to the world's most
celebrated corporate leader. Running GE may be, as Jack Welch claims, the 
best job in the world, but his
successor may find it to be one of the toughest as well -- not because 
anything is going wrong at GE, but because
so much is going right, and has been for so long. 

Mr. Welch's successor will inherit a company that is already stupendously 
valuable, that has already shed most of
its unwanted pounds, and has already set a string of performance records. How 
do you do better than that?

This is more than a rhetorical question for GE's next chairman. Pity, for a 
moment, a few other heirs to greatness.
Doug Ivester was gone just 25 months after following the legendary Roberto 
Goizueta at Coca-Cola. Dale Morrison
lasted less than four years at Campbell Soup after taking over from 
cost-cutter extraordinaire David Johnson. British
Airway's Bob Ayling got pushed out after he had struggled unsuccessfully to 
fill the shoes of Colin Marshall. And
Durk Jager prematurely stepped down as Procter & Gamble's chairman after 
failing to live up to the lofty standards
set by earlier P&G leaders. 

Pretenders 

None of the pretenders succeeded in building greatness on top of greatness. 
In three of these cases, the board
brought back a recently retired CEO or chairman to shore up investor 
confidence. Sadly, Goizueta, who died in
October 1997, could not reprise his earlier success at Coca-Cola. 

GE's next chairman will have to exceed Mr. Welch's near-mythic 
accomplishments if GE is to continue to fly high.
Like Cisco, Intel, Wal-Mart, Nokia and any other company that is exploring 
the outer atmosphere, GE must struggle
ever harder to resist the laws that threaten to flatten the arc of success: 
the law of large numbers, the law of
diminishing returns, and the law of averages. 

-- The law of large numbers: Over the past decade GE's market value has 
multiplied eleven-fold -- to more than $560
billion from $50 billion at the end of 1990. Sustaining such a breathtaking 
pace of value growth gets progressively
harder as a company gets bigger. As the most valuable company on the planet, 
GE would need to grow its market
cap to nearly $3 trillion over the next five years to match the 42% 
compounded annual growth rate it has achieved
over the past half-decade. 

One way of escaping the law of large numbers is to divide big things into 
small things. One option for GE would be
to spin out its low-growth businesses as separate companies. Over the past 
five years, profits in two sectors --
appliances and plastics -- were essentially flat. Holding these businesses 
may generate a positive return on
invested capital, but no investor would keep them inside a growth portfolio. 
Why should GE? 

If GE's next chairman can't muster the courage to leave the dawdlers behind, 
perhaps he -- or she -- should spin out
the stars. Of the eight large business segments for which GE reports results, 
two -- GE Capital and NBC -- account
for nearly 50% of GE's five-year profit growth. Sure, GE Capital has 
benefited from its parent's dirt-cheap cost of
capital, but from an investor's point of view, these advantages may be more 
than offset by the drag of laggardly
earnings growth in other GE businesses. Looking beyond capital and 
broadcasting, there are probably a dozen
other high-growth candidates for spin-outs in GE's other sectors. 

Mr. Welch's successor shouldn't be afraid to disassemble GE. After all, the 
goal is not to make GE the "world's
most valuable company," but to make its shareholders the world's most richly 
rewarded. Shareholders don't care
whether GE's stock appreciates or whether it's the stock of companies that GE 
has disgorged. Breaking up is hard
to do. But Mr. Welch's successor may find that turning GE into the world's 
first $3 trillion company is even harder. 

-- The law of diminishing returns: Even the most successful strategies lose 
their potency over time. For most of Mr.
Welch's tenure, GE's strategies of choice have been cost cutting and 
acquisitions. From its unflinching approach to
downsizing in the mid-1980s, to its more recent dedication to e-business, Mr. 
Welch's GE has been imaginative
and unrelenting in excising waste. At the same time, GE's top line has been 
buoyed up by a tidal wave of
acquisitions -- more than 300 in the past three years, many outside the U.S. 

The payoff to all this cutting and deal making has been steadily accelerating 
earnings growth. Net earnings grew
10.8% in 1996, 12.7% in 1997, 13.3% in 1998 and 15.3% in 1999. Looking 
forward, power dieting and binge buying
may not be enough to keep GE's earnings escalator rising ever skyward. 

There are already signs that GE may be nearing the asymptotic end of the 
efficiency curve. Between 1981 and
1990, GE's revenue per employee increased by 187%. Yet over the last decade, 
revenue per employee grew by a
more modest 55%, and has been essentially flat since 1996. And while 
operating margins in GE's manufacturing
businesses have been steadily improving, GE's net profit margin, after all 
adjustments, has remained pretty much
unchanged over the past five years. 

What about acquisitions? While industry consolidation still has a way to run, 
particularly outside the U.S., it seems
inevitable that it will become harder and harder for GE to find under-priced, 
under-managed fixer-uppers. After all, at
the current furious pace of corporate coupling, the U.S. would be left with a 
single company by 2010. 

That leaves "e." E-commerce will drive new efficiencies into GE's business 
processes, but GE is not alone in
striving to e-enable its businesses. E-commerce is rapidly becoming an 
information technology arms race -- with
competitors making tit-for-tat investments to reap tit-for-tat efficiency 
gains. And while efficiency-besotted CEOs are
counting on the Internet to shrink procurement costs, savvy customers will be 
just as creative in using the Net to
beat down prices. Whether GE's enthusiasm for all things "e" produces 
long-lasting, peer-beating profit growth
remains to be seen. 

GE's next chairman may want to borrow a lesson or two from Enron, which has 
been voted America's most
innovative company five years running and displaced GE as the "best managed 
company" in Fortune magazine's
last "most admired" survey. Forty percent of Enron's $63 billion market value 
comes from businesses the company
wasn't even in three years ago -- all of them are homegrown. 

Forget acquisitions. With GE's powerful brand, global reach and fearsome 
capacity for execution, there's no reason
GE shouldn't surpass Enron as a business-building champ. It is entirely 
reasonable to expect that GE could create
10 to 20 new businesses over the next few years -- with each adding an 
average of $5 billion to GE's market value. 

Sooner or later GE is going to need an entirely new genre of wealth-creating 
strategies -- and a much more
aggressive commitment to internally generated new business development may 
well be the most promising
candidate. 

-- The law of averages: Over the past five years, GE's price/earnings ratio 
has tripled, from just over 16 to more than
48. The company is currently selling at a 65% premium to the market average 
P/E. But being a standout performer
for more than a few years at a time is a daunting challenge for any company, 
large or small. It seems that no
company can forever escape the steady tug of mediocrity. 

At the end of 1999, the Standard & Poor's 500 included 326 companies that had 
been in the index for the entire
decade. Fifty-five of these companies, among them GE, managed to deliver top 
quartile shareholder returns in as
many as four years out of the previous 10. GE's top quartile results came in 
1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999. If GE's
new chairman manages to extend this streak for another four years, GE will 
set a new world record, for none of the
326 S&P veterans achieved top quartile returns in as many as eight years out 
of 10 during the '90s, and only four
companies -- Oracle, Home Depot, Intel and Cisco -- cleared the bar seven 
years out of 10. 

If GE can fire up the entrepreneurial spirit in each of its employees, it 
just might beat the odds. Like most large
companies, GE seems to be reluctant to encourage employees to start new 
businesses by giving them equity
stakes in new ventures. While this isn't the only way to build businesses, 
it's one that can't be ignored in a world
where talented employees are often lured away by the promise of a big chunk 
of equity in a start-up. GE already
invests in start-ups via GE Equity -- to the tune of $1.5 billion in 1999. 
Last year GE also repurchased $1.9 billion of
its own stock. One wonders just what kind of new wealth GE's own employees 
might have been able to create if
they had been backed by this kind of capital? 

To have any hope of escaping Mr. Welch's shadow, and matching his success, 
GE's next chairman will have to
keep a simple truth in mind: If you're trying to achieve unprecedented ends, 
you're going to need unprecedented
means. A break-up, a few major spin-outs, a bottom-to-top initiative focused 
on making GE as good at creating bold
new businesses as it is at improving existing businesses, an absolute 
commitment to doubling or tripling GE's
internal growth rate -- these are all potential candidates for the next big 
thing at GE. 

Maybe, just maybe, GE will continue to fly high with its current success 
recipes. One could argue that as long as
there are companies around the world that aren't as well-managed as GE, Mr. 
Welch's magnificent buy-and-improve
engine will have plenty of fuel. Or that GE's Web-smitten executives will 
discover Net advantages no one else has
yet dreamed of. 

After 20 years under Mr. Welch, GE is habituated to meeting new challenges. 
Moreover, GE has a long history of
organizational and managerial innovation -- it was among the first to 
decentralize along business unit lines, embrace
disciplined strategic planning, delayer its hierarchical organization, and 
commit itself to becoming Webified from
stem to stern. Like the Internet, GE is diverse, global, flat, meritocratic 
and non-hierarchical. 

Maybe all of this will help GE to become one of the first companies to marry 
the rule-busting, business-building
ethos of the "new economy" with the "old economy" virtues of scale, 
efficiency and quality. If GE succeeds, there
will be no more talk of new economy and old economy, for GE will have managed 
to create a perfect synthesis of
old and new. And the most perfectly developed specimen of the industrial age 
will have become the archetype for
the post-industrial corporation -- a company that uses its size and 
operational excellence to crush the upstarts, and
its industry-transforming innovation to constantly surprise the old farts. 
This is a worthy, and necessary, aspiration
for the next leader of America's pre-eminent corporation.

Spiraling energy costs creating near-crisis situation

Abreast of the Market
S&P Index Seemed Tranquil This Year, but...
By E.S. Browning
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

09/18/2000

Amid the storm that has swept the Nasdaq Composite Index this year, the 
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index
looks like a sea of tranquility. 

Since Jan. 1, it has gone almost exactly nowhere, starting the year at 
1469.25 and closing Friday at 1465.81.

But beneath the quiet surface, a furious battle is raging among the S&P's 
components, with some of last year's
losers becoming this year's winners. 

Some of the most amazing performers are the natural-gas companies, which are 
up about 70% as a group so far
this year. "The natural-gas index looks like an Internet stock from a year 
ago," says Richard Bernstein, chief
quantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch. 

El Paso Energy is up 70% so far this year. KeySpan Energy is up almost 60%. 
On top of its stock gain, KeySpan
offers something some investors aren't familiar with: a 5% dividend. 

Now the big question is, should investors be plowing their money into the 
recent winners, which also include drug
stocks, brokerage-firm stocks and bank stocks? Or is their surge a flash in 
the pan that will evaporate as investors
get over their jitters in the fall? 

Higher oil prices helped send utility stocks up on Friday, and most other 
stocks down. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average fell 1.45%, or 160.47 points, to 10927.00, leaving the blue-chip 
index down 2.62%, or 293.65 points, for the
week. 

The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 2.01% on the day and 3.6% on the week. 
The Dow Jones Utility Average,
however, rose 1.52%, or 5.94 points, on Friday to a record 397.04, leaving it 
up 2.78% on the week. 

The S&P 500, still the broadest of the major market indexes, dropped 1% on 
Friday. But it is just 4% off its record
of 1527.46, set March 24. In contrast, the technology-heavy Nasdaq index is 
down 24% from its March 10 high. 

Within the S&P 500, though, there have been some dramatic moves. Utilities 
are up an astounding 40%, just in the
time since the S&P peaked on March 24, according to Ned Davis Research. 
Financials and drug stocks are up
about 16% each -- again, since the S&P hit a record. 

Communications stocks, on the other hand, have fallen 25% in that period. The 
S&P 500's big tech stocks are
down more than 19%. 

Some analysts think the move that is under way is broader than a sector 
rotation. Some of the least-wanted stocks
of 1999 have become desirable this year. As huge stocks, such as Qualcomm and 
Yahoo!, have sagged, smaller,
once-neglected S&P companies, such as Reebok and Allied Waste, have soared. 

The switch can be seen in an index called the Value Line Arithmetic Index. 
That index tracks about 1,700
companies and doesn't give any extra weight to the ones with a larger market 
value. It is a closer reflection of the
average company, rather than the biggest companies. 

So far this year, it is up 13%, eclipsing the S&P 500. The S&P 500 is 
weighted according to its members' market
value, which means that it is dominated by the larger stocks. The Value Line 
index's strength compared with the
S&P 500 is a clear indication that some of the smaller stocks are making a 
comeback, at least for now. 

Some of the gains do seem to reflect special circumstances. Utilities have 
been helped by an explosion in
natural-gas prices and by a search for stable investments in a turbulent 
stock market. Many banks and brokerage
firms have benefited from takeover speculation: Merrill Lynch is up 66% so 
far this year; Lehman Brothers is up
69%. 

If takeover expectations fade, the brokerage stocks risk a slide. And energy 
companies depend on oil and gas
prices, which can make them volatile. Natural-gas bulls note, however, that 
natural-gas prices are expected to
remain high for some time, which could keep propelling that group ahead. 

"Very few people thought energy prices would remain this high for as long as 
they have," notes Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette investment strategist Thomas Galvin. "So you still have people 
underweighted both areas, energy and
utilities." 

That means that there still are plenty of skeptics out there. If gas prices 
stay high, the stocks have room to rise as
skeptics are won over. 

But the real trick during the coming months may not be to be in the right 
sector, but to be in the right stock, both
men say. 

At a time when the economy is slowing and earnings growth will be more 
difficult, "you probably want higher-quality
stocks, because they have more stable earnings," Mr. Bernstein says. 

When tech stocks or utility stocks are in favor, it is enough to buy a stock 
from the group and your stock will go up.
Now investors need to be more selective. 

"El Paso and Duke Energy are extremely well managed," says Mr. Galvin, "as is 
Enron. But the rising tide in
utilities has lifted all boats, and not all utilities are well enough managed 
to take advantage of all opportunities." 

The key is choosing the stocks that will withstand the more difficult times 
to come, and that won't be easy. People
who bought Intel or Oracle at the start of this year probably feel as if it 
wasn't that bad a year for tech. Both, despite
a recent sag, still are up almost 40% this year. Those who chose Microsoft or 
Dell, however, took a bath: Microsoft
is down 45% since the year began, and Dell is down almost 30%. 

Mr. Galvin thinks tech stocks will stage a fourth-quarter rally, as investors 
look for companies that can continue to
build profits in a slowing economy. He points out that analysts expect tech 
to post 38% earnings growth next year,
only a bit less than this year's 41%. But benefiting from any rally would 
require picking the stocks that will have the
good earnings. 

Another way of looking at the uncertain future, says Bob Bissell, president 
of Wells Capital Management, is that
there could be some unexpected events. Companies whose stock prices have 
fallen could be acquired, or forced to
restructure, which could provide a payoff for investors. 

"I am thinking of companies like AT&T," he says. "Something has got to give 
there. The stock is down to the low
30s," 47% down from its 52-week high of 61. "Something has got to happen. Do 
you fragment the company?" 

He also points to midcap stocks, another of the year's strongest performers. 
"I call the category `the forgotten
prince,' " he says. The S&P Midcap 400 index is doing even better than the 
Value Line index, up 22% since the
year began. 

Some midcap companies deserve to be forgotten, of course. But the index also 
contains some smaller banks that
could be takeover targets, and it has some fast-growing tech companies too. 
"It is getting stronger as the
technological revolution moves companies rapidly from smallcap to midcap," 
Mr. Bissell says.

Friday's Market Activity 

Soaring energy prices knocked market averages sharply lower. 

American Express lost $1.50 to $59.31, Chase Manhattan dropped 1.66 to 49, 
and General Electric, which has an
exposure to the group through its financial-services operations, gave up 2.13 
to 56.69. 

The group also suffered from a cooling in takeover speculation. Lehman 
Brothers, for example, fell 8 to 142.50,
Goldman Sachs lost 4.25 to 124.75 and Bear Stearns gave up 4.75 to 65. 

Higher oil prices helped Exxon Mobil rise 3.60 to 88.88. It reached a 52-week 
high, its first since Dec. 9, while
Amerada Hess climbed 4.56 to 73.25, and touched a 52-week high of its own. 

Database software company Oracle (Nasdaq) fell 6.63 to 78.31, with 60 million 
shares changing hands. Despite
Oracle's announcement of strong quarterly earnings Thursday after the end of 
normal trading, some analysts said
they were disappointed with the company's revenue growth. 

Siebel Systems (Nasdaq), an Oracle competitor, added 4.19 to 99. However, i2 
Technologies fell 3.69 to 172.19,
while Ariba lost 5.13 to 152.44, both on Nasdaq. 

Red Hat (Nasdaq) lost 4.06 to 21.19. The Research Triangle Park, N.C., 
developer of open-source software products
posted a narrower-than-expected second-quarter loss, but left some analysts 
disappointed. 

Avon Products eased 50 cents to 41.19. The New York beauty-products marketing 
concern said late Thursday the
Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating a $10 million charge the 
company took in 1999 related to the
write-off of computer software. 

Adobe Systems (Nasdaq) moved up 7.25 to 132.63. The San Jose, Calif., 
software developer reported fiscal
third-quarter earnings that topped forecasts. 

Maytag fell 2.19 to 33.63, after the Newton, Iowa, home-appliance maker 
warned about second-half earnings. 

Ivax rose 2.38 to 43.63. The Miami pharmaceutical maker received final 
approved from the Food and Drug
Administration for its generic equivalent of Bristol-Myers Squibb's cancer 
drug Taxol. 

Carnival Corp. gained 1.75 to 22.88, while rival Royal Caribbean Cruises 
advanced 1.75 to 24.50. The stocks rose
on hopes that the withdrawal from the market of a smaller competitor will 
ease excess capacity.

Politics & Policy
The Homestretch

The Gore and Bush campaigns will argue over which did better in the debate 
over debates, but one winner is clear:
PBS news anchor Jim Lehrer. Not only will he moderate all three presidential 
debates sponsored by the bipartisan
Commission on Presidential Debates, but, under an agreement completed over 
the weekend, he will do so under
rules giving him more flexibility than ever before. He will be free to bore 
in on a specific subject and extend
discussion of it, rather than simply move on to other questions as in the 
past. Under the debate agreement, the two
candidates will stand behind lecterns at the opening debate Oct. 3, sit 
around a table in talk-show fashion on Oct.
11, and debate in a town-hall format on Oct. 17. 

In other campaign developments:

-- Housing policy? In the closest thing yet to a campaign debate on housing 
issues, the Republican party's Web
site is trying to entice listeners to dial in to radio talk shows and charge 
that Democrats are running "The Slumlord
Ticket." Why? On top of a recent controversy over complaints by tenants of a 
rental house in Tennessee owned by
Vice President Gore, the Web site touts the story of a similar headache now 
faced by running mate Joseph
Lieberman. An immigrant mother was evicted when she was injured and fell 
behind in rent payments at a property
owned by the estate of Mr. Lieberman's wealthy late uncle; Mr. Lieberman is 
executor of the estate. 

-- A fish story: To the list of the perils of holding public office, now add 
the danger of flying fish. Just ask Rep. Helen
Chenoweth-Hage, an Idaho Republican, who was pelted with rotting salmon 
thrown by a 20-year-old protester at a
hearing on Western wildfires held in Montana over the weekend. The protester 
cried out that the conservative
congresswoman is "the greatest threat to the forest" and uncorked the salmon. 
She wasn't hurt, but the Associated
Press reports that "the hearing was recessed while she cleaned salmon from 
her hair and jacket."

GE Tops Fortune's Ranking of the World's Most Admired Companies; Key To 
Staying Ahead of the Pack Is Innovation

09/18/2000
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2000, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 18, 2000--For the third straight year, 
General Electric, on the strength of its
management team and innovative global strategy, is No. 1 on FORTUNE's ranking 
of the most admired companies
in the world. FORTUNE's third annual list of Global Most Admired Companies 
consists of 379 companies in 27
industries, with 25 selected as "all-stars" for exemplifying leadership on a 
global scale. Cisco Systems came in at
No. 2 on the all-star ranking (up from No. 8 in 1999); other repeat 
performers in the top ten include Microsoft, whose
battles with government regulators on one flank and perceptions of a 
foundering Internet strategy on the other
caused it to slip to No. 3 from No. 2; Intel (No.4); and Wal-Mart Stores, 
which moved up to No. 5 from No. 7. The
complete list of FORTUNE's Global Most Admired Companies appears in the 
October 2 issue of FORTUNE and is
available at www.fortune.com as of Monday, Sept.18, at 8:30 a.m. 

According to Nicholas Stein's article, "The World's Most Admired Companies," 
the schizophrenic market conditions
of the past year offer one reason why the Most Admired list looks so 
different this year. As Stein writes: "The
winners are companies that demonstrated a new-economy style growth strategy 
while maintaining an old-economy
approach to fiscal responsibility." And, as Vicki Wright, global managing 
director of the Hay Group consultancy that
helped produce the list with FORTUNE notes: "There is something new this year 
in how we perceive companies. It
is the emphasis on how much companies are capable of looking forward. In a 
year when old-economy companies
have not seen their share price perform, those that have managed to weather 
both the old- and new-economy
storms will flourish."

Notable changes among this year's Global Most Admired list include Home Depot 
leaping from No. 20 to No. 9,
Toyota moving up from No. 16 to No. 10, and Citgroup advancing from No. 25 to 
No. 18. Strong demand for Sony's
flat-screen TVs, digital cameras, and PlayStation game consoles helped the 
company move up from 14 to 6.
Newcomers to this year's list -- Enron, Nokia, Charles Schwab, UPS, and 
Goldman Sachs -- all embody business
strategies that bridge the old and new economic worlds. Companies that lost 
their all-star status -- IBM,
Hewlett-Packard, AT&T, Procter & Gamble, DaimlerChrysler -- have been plagued 
with difficulties integrating new
business concepts. 

Many of the industry categories also experienced significant turnover. Among 
airline companies, Singapore Airlines,
which didn't even make last year's list, took the top spot from Southwest. 
British Airways, hobbled by internal
conflict and heightened competition, fell from third to seventh. Though Intel 
held on to the top ranking in the
computer hardware and software category, Sun Microsystems rode the dot-com 
revolution to second place, up from
sixth last year, while Dell, facing a wireless (and PC-less) future, fell 
from fifth to eighth. And in the white-hot
network communications and Internet technology sector, all-star newcomer 
Nokia edged Cisco Systems for top
billing. 

To find out what unique management qualities set these companies apart from 
their peers, the Hay Group surveyed
the Most Admired Companies and their less admired peers about the performance 
measures they use to chart the
progress of their companies. 

According to their findings, Most Admired companies set more challenging 
goals, link the compensation of their
executives more closely to the completion of those goals, and are generally 
more oriented toward long-term
performance. 

To complete the list of the world's most admired companies, FORTUNE consulted 
the experts: the business
executives who run companies, and the analysts who study them. Global 
companies were rated according to eight
criteria: quality of management; quality of products or services; 
innovativeness; long-term investment value; financial
soundness; ability to attract, develop and retain talent; community 
responsibility; and use of corporate assets. To
reflect this list's international scope, a ninth category was added: global 
business acumen. A company's overall
ranking is the average of the scores of all nine attributes. Companies are 
ranked within their industry, and the top 25
-- the All-Stars -- are culled from across all industry groups. 


The October 2 issue is available on newsstands beginning September 25. For

The "Hub & Spoke" analysis is an appropriate method for determining the 
ability of a market participant to exercise market power in transmission.  
Market based rate applications for transmission-owning utilities merit the 
same level of scrutiny as that given to merger applications, i.e., a 
competitive screening analysis followed by a more detailed behavioral 
analysis whenever the screen reveals potential market power.  Modernizing 
this type of market power analysis required with market based rate 
applications is of equal importance to that of improving the analysis for 
merger applications, as recognized by the Commission in its recent Filing 
Requirements Rulemaking, Order No. 642, Revised Filing Requirements Under 
Part 33 of the Commission's Regulations, 93 F.E.R.C. ? 61,164, 65 Fed. Reg.

Study Finds That Many Large Companies Pay No Taxes 
By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 
? 
10/20/2000 
The New York Times 
Page 2, Column 1 
c. 2000 New York Times Company 
Goodyear, Texaco, Colgate-Palmolive, MCI WorldCom and eight other large 
corporations earned more than $12.2 billion in profits in 1996 through 1998, 
but none of them ended up owing corporate income taxes over that period, 
according to a study released yesterday. Indeed, as a group, the companies 
received $535 million in credits or refunds, the report found. 
The study of 250 large publicly traded companies showed that 24 owed no tax 
or received credits against past or future tax obligations in 1998, up from 
13 in 1997 and 16 in 1996. The study also found that 71 of the 250 companies 
paid taxes at less than half the official 35 percent corporate rate during 
the three-year period. 
The study was conducted by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a 
Washington research organization associated with Citizens for Tax Justice, a 
nonprofit group supported in part by labor unions. The group argues that the 
tax system favors the rich and politically connected. 
Corporate profits overall soared 23.5 percent during the three-year period, 
but corporate tax revenues grew just 7.7 percent, a disjunction that has 
drawn intense interest from the Treasury Department and some members of 
Congress who are concerned about the growing market for tax shelters and 
their abuse. 
In recent years, Congress has watered down the 1986 overhaul of the tax laws, 
which lowered rates and eliminated most tax shelters, and was supposed to 
simplify reporting. The recent changes have opened fresh opportunities for 
corporations to cut their taxes, the study found. 
''Corporate taxes are not rising along with profits because companies have 
found all sorts of ways to get around the reforms in the 1986 tax act,'' said 
Robert S. McIntyre, the director of Citizens for Tax Justice. ''Companies 
also have gotten a lot of help from Congress, especially in gutting the 
minimum tax rules.'' 
Mr. McIntyre said that he and T. D. Coo Nguyen, the co-author, spent more 
than two years examining financial statements the companies sent to 
shareholders. 
All but 18 of the companies studied are on the Fortune 500 list, and the 
others are in the Fortune 1000. He said companies were excluded if they lost 
money or their tax disclosures ''were crafted so that you could not figure 
them out.'' 
At least two companies objected to the study's methodology. 
Keith Price, a spokesman for Goodyear, said the study did not appear to 
consider an accounting rule affecting its sale of a pipeline subsidiary in 
1998. It made no objection to the 1996 and 1997 figures. 
Michael N. Ambler, Texaco's chief tax counsel, said that his company had tax 
disputes with the Internal Revenue Service that were unresolved after more 
than a decade. If those disputes are settled with a refund, he said, that can 
easily distort the figures for any one year. He said that even the three-year 
study period was too short to give an accurate picture. 
Timothy McCormally of the Tax Executives Institute, which represents 
officials at large companies, told Bloomberg News that the companies named in 
the report did nothing wrong. ''There is nothing in the report that suggests 
that any of this results from any illegal or improper activity,'' he said. 
The study by the Washington institute showed that the corporate tax burden 
was falling in many cases because of the growing use of stock options, which 
are an expense for tax purposes but do not count against profits reported to 
shareholders. 
Recent annual reports filed by Microsoft and Cisco Systems indicate that they 
paid no federal income taxes in 1999 because stock options exercised by 
employees wiped out profits for tax purposes. 
The study found that General Electric, I.B.M., Pfizer, Intel and 
Bristol-Myers Squibb also sharply reduced their tax rates because of stock 
options without having to show reduced earnings to shareholders. 
The most significant factor in the easing corporate tax burden, Mr. McIntyre 
said, can be traced to actions in Congress, which relaxed the corporate 
minimum tax in 1993 when the Democrats were in control of both the House and 
Senate, and again in 1997, after the Republicans had taken over. Congress 
made it easier for corporations to spread tax breaks and profits over many 
years, including reaching back to past years to get tax breaks that could not 
be used at the time. 
In at least one of the three years studied, 41 of the 250 large companies 
studied paid no federal income tax. Those 41 companies reported $25.8 billion 
in profits to shareholders in the years they paid no taxes. If they had been 
obligated to pay the full 35 percent corporate rate, the tax bill would have 
been $9 billion, but the companies received $3.2 billion in refunds. 
In total dollars, General Electric was the biggest beneficiary of tax breaks, 
the study said, saving $6.9 billion in three years. The company paid $2.1 
billion in income taxes on $25.8 billion in profits, for a tax rate of 8.1 
percent. 
The highest tax rate for the three years was paid by Winn-Dixie Stores, which 
paid an average of 35.7 percent of its 1996 through 1998 profits in federal 
income taxes. It was one of two companies that paid more than the 35 percent 
statutory rate because of multiyear tax rules. The other was Paccar. 

Chart: ''Profits Without Pain'' In a study of 250 large and profitable 
companies, these 17 paid the least in corporate taxes -- or got the biggest 
refunds -- as a percentage of profits from 1996 to 1998. Goodyear 1996-98

Legal Breaks Lower Some Corporate Tax Rates 
?

Los Angeles Times 
Home Edition

Copyright 2000 / The Times Mirror Company 
WASHINGTON -- Dozens of America's most profitable companies enjoyed tax-free 
years during the 1990s largely because of legal tax breaks, an independent 
study released Thursday found. 
The report by the nonprofit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found 
that 250 companies paid an effective tax rate of 20.1% in 1998, down from 
22.9% just two years before. The federal income tax rate for corporations is 
supposed to be 35%. 
Of the 250 companies studied, 41 enjoyed at least one year of no income taxes 
or an actual rebate from the federal government, despite pretax profits of 
$25.8 billion from 1996 to 1998. 
If all 250 companies had paid the full 35% on $735 billion in pretax profits, 
the study estimated the total income tax would have come to $257 billion. But 
tax breaks put into law by Congress lowered those companies' tax bills by $98 
billion over the three-year period. 
Companies getting tax rebates in 1998 alone included Texaco Inc., Chevron 
Corp., PepsiCo Inc., J.P. Morgan & Co., Enron Corp. and General Motors Corp., 
the report found. 
The study's chief author, Robert S. McIntyre, said companies lower their 
taxes through such breaks as depreciation write-offs, tax credits for 
research and development and deductions they take when employees exercise 
stock options. 
The report also found that the petroleum industry paid the lowest tax rate 
from 1996 to 1998, at 12.3%, followed by electronics at 13.1%, forest and 
paper products at 13.9% and transportation at 14%. At the other end of the 
spectrum, publishing and printing companies paid 31.6%, gas and electric 
utilities paid 28.1% and retail and wholesale trade companies paid 27.6%.

Arena boosters tout 3 benefits 
Some question property/sales tax numbers, new development 
By ERIC BERGER 
Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Enron Field sparked the redevelopment of downtown's east side, boosters say, 
and an arena would crown the revitalization of the long-neglected area. 
A strongly pro-arena business organization, Central Houston Inc., released a 
flurry of positive economic numbers to back its contention that Enron Field 
is a boon to downtown as well as to city, county and school tax coffers, and 
that the arena would be as well. 
"There's no better way to measure the impact of sports facilities on downtown 
than to look at the one we already have," said the organization's president, 
Bob Eury, as he crooked a finger toward the ballpark. 
Eury and other boosters outlined three economic benefits to Houston they say 
are related to sports facilities: increased property tax revenues, a wealth 
of new development in the area and a boost in sales tax collected. 
But economic analysts questioned some of their conclusions. 
When Enron Field was built, nine blocks were taken off the tax rolls at a 
cost of about $284,000 in lost property taxes. 
Eury said, though, that it was not a bad trade. 
He noted that properties around the ballpark have leaped in value since the 
Enron Field project began in the mid-1990s. In turn, the annual property tax 
collected on land and buildings within four blocks of the ballpark is $2.4 
million greater now than in 1995. 
But Harris County Tax Assessor-Collector Paul Bettencourt said those figures 
are due in part to the boom in land values across downtown, including the 
central business district, since 1995. 
Bettencourt said he hoped to have an analysis finished today to determine 
whether land values around Enron Field had increased at a greater rate than 
land in the rest of downtown. 
The boosters also highlighted more than $700 million worth of private 
developments planned -- but not yet completed -- near the ballpark, including 
the $90 million, 37-story Ballpark Place Tower across Crawford Street from 
Enron Field. 
"Without a doubt, if Enron Field was not there, Ballpark Place would not be 
there," said John Holland, an executive vice president for the Trammel Crow 
Co., which expects to break ground on the project in early 2001. 
Because the arena would be built in an urban core, even academics who are 
skeptical about the economic benefits of sports stadiums agreed that spin-off 
development is likely nearby. 
But independent economists who have studied such issues, including Brad 
Humphreys, an assistant professor at the University of Maryland-Baltimore 
County, say development near a stadium usually has a negative impact on 
development and businesses in other parts of a city. 
The focus must be on the entire market, Humphreys said, not just in the 
vicinity of a sports facility. 
"Public subsidization of stadiums and arenas isn't necessarily a bad thing," 
he said. "But when they sell them as economic engines, it's just absolutely 
wrong. The research doesn't show that." 
A recent study Humphreys co-authored, which appeared in the fall 1999 issue 
of the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, found that the presence of 
professional sports teams in a market, on average, actually reduced the 
per-capita income in those markets, compared with similar markets without 
such teams. 
Given Houston's strong economy, Eury said he does not believe downtown 
development will detract from other areas of the city, as Humphreys' studies 
have shown in other markets. 
A third major economic benefit offered Thursday was that a new arena, with 
the Houston Rockets and Houston Comets as tenants, would generate $13 million 
a year in sales tax revenues. 
About $2.7 million of that would go into local coffers, with the remainder 
going to the state, according to the study performed for Eury's group by CSL 
International, a consulting firm. 
Yet even in the absence of a new arena and both teams, many economists say a 
large portion of those expenditures would be spent in the area anyway. That 
is known as a "substitution effect." 
Instead of a family going to a game, it might go to the movies or local zoo. 
And corporations are likely to sponsor other local events out of their 
advertising budgets, the economists say. 
The CSL study did not account for this substitution effect in calculating the 
sales tax impact, said Bill Rhoda, the firm's director. 


	



Study: Dozens of corporations pay little or no income tax

WASHINGTON (AP) - Dozens of America's most profitable companies enjoyed 
tax-free years during the 1990s largely because of legal tax breaks, an 
independent study released Thursday found. 
The report by the nonprofit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found 
that 250 companies paid an effective tax rate of 20.1 percent in 1998, down 
from 22.9 percent just two years before. The federal income tax rate for 
corporations is supposed to be 35 percent.
Of the 250 companies studied, 41 enjoyed at least one year of no income taxes 
or an actual rebate from the federal government, despite pretax profits of 
$25.8 billion from 1996-98. 
If all 250 companies had paid the full 35 percent on $735 billion in pretax 
profits, the study estimated the total income tax would have come to $257 
billion. But tax breaks put into law by Congress lowered those companies' tax 
bills by $98 billion over the three-year period. 
Companies getting tax rebates in 1998 alone included Texaco, Chevron, 
Pepsico, J.P. Morgan, Enron and General Motors, the report found. 
The study's chief author, Robert S. McIntyre, said companies lower their 
taxes through such breaks as depreciation write-offs, tax credits for 
research and development and deductions they take when employees exercise 
stock options. 
"We hope our findings will encourage lawmakers to re-examine this important 
area of taxation," McIntyre said. 
The report also found that the petroleum industry paid the lowest tax rate 
from 1996-98, at 12.3 percent, followed by electronics at 13.1 percent, 
forest and paper products at 13.9 percent and transportation at 14 percent. 
At the other end of the spectrum, publishing and printing companies paid 31.6 
percent, gas and electric utilities paid 28.1 percent and retail and 
wholesale trade companies paid 27.6 percent. 
"Anyone who worries about our economy's long-term growth has to wonder why 
the tax code is being used to favor some industries and some kinds of 
investments over others, rather than letting market forces decide," McIntyre 
said.

US Rep Drafts Bill To Impose Windfall Tax On Pwr Companies.
By JASON LEOPOLD

10/19/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California's summer of soaring wholesale 
electricity prices helped boost the stock price of many energy companies in 
the third quarter.
But if U.S. Rep. Bob Filner, D-Calif., gets his way, those companies will be 
forced to pay back hundreds of millions of dollars in profit to utilities, 
customers and the government. 
Filner introduced a bill in the House of Representatives last week that would 
impose a windfall profit tax on wholesale power sold throughout the western 
U.S. 
The bill, which was referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means, may be 
discussed in December or January, according to Filner, and if he gets enough 
support by the mostly Republican caucus, companies like Enron Corp. (ENE), 
Duke Energy North America (DUK), Southern Co. (SO). Reliant Energy (REI) and 
Dynegy (DYN), would only be allowed to show a certain amount of profit and 
anything over that amount would be taxed 100%. 
Filner said the amount of profit hasn't been determined but his bill calls 
for a baseline that would be a "just and reasonable" amount of profit. 
The congressman's San Diego constituents were paying market-based electricity 
rates in the summer which resulted in triple-digit utility bills. He said 
generators are gouging California customers and need to be held responsible. 
"This is not just a problem of supply and demand," Filner told Dow Jones 
Newswires. "This is stealing. And we want our money back." 
State and federal regulators are conducting separate investigations into 
California's wholesale power crisis. The findings, expected to be complete in 
about two weeks, are aimed at determining if generators or other key players 
manipulated the state's wholesale energy market. 
At least two major energy companies are being investigated by California 
Attorney General Bill Lockyer. A high level source working on the probe with 
the Attorney General said third-quarter earnings statements will play a major 
role in finding out if generators manipulated the market. 
Their investigation isn't turning up much evidence but earnings statements 
are showing that profits are up significantly largely due to wholesale prices 
in California, the source said. 
At least one Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioner, who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity, said the wholesale electricity market in California 
will be in for a "rude awakening" when the agency completes its 
investigation. 
"There will be some serious structural changes to the market," the 
commissioner said. 
Representatives from energy companies told Dow Jones Newswires that higher 
profits weren't the result of illegal activity or manipulating the market. 
Energy Cos. Say Summer Crisis Boosted 3Q Earnings 
On Wednesday, Duke Energy, which owns and operates power plants in 
California, said in an earnings statement that third-quarter profit rose 74%, 
due in part, to high wholesale prices in California in the summer. Enron and 
several other companies reported similar third-quarter increases based on 
California's summer of skyrocketing power prices. 
The congressman doesn't want to limit the proposed windfall tax to 
California, but where generators sell power in the western U.S. 
But even Filner admits that forcing generators to refund part of their 
profits isn't getting the early support it needs to become law. 
"If the democrats were in charge I'd have this bill voted on already," Filner 
said. 
Filner said if the bill is passed some of the money would be refunded to 
consumers and utilities, the victims, as he refers to them. 
Meanwhile, he's also working on getting the House to pass a separate bill to 
roll back electricity rates in the western U.S. to pre-deregulation levels 
and he's trying to gather support for a wind power initiative. 
Regardless of the outcome, the congressman is dead set on making noise. 
"If nothing happens, I'm thinking about holding a press conference with the 
San Diego District Attorney," he said. "We'll press criminal charges against 
the energy companies." -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;

		 Subject: Thank You

Steve,

Thanks for arranging a great afternoon yesterday - - I very much enjoyed our
conversation on people and idea generation as well as gaining a good
overview of Enron's key businesses. The tour was extremely educational and
we had a good discussion with Nate Ellis on Retail Services at the end of
the day.

I like your idea of getting the top executives together at some point soon -
- I know our Chairman, Chuck Knight, would be very fascinated with the
transformation at Enron and your business models for future growth. He also
loves to share and contrast different management processes and I think all
involved would take away some ideas to consider. David Farr, our new CEO,
would gain much from such an interaction and hopefully the establishment of
a long relationship between our firms and executive teams.

On top of this, I see a tremendous potential for our firms to work together
in a number of key areas where our product and service technologies would
complement the Enron offering of market making and risk management. I
appreciate your offer to help navigate some contacts to evaluate some of
these opportunities. Some initial impressions include:

* Evaluating the use of Energy Services on a broad scale at Emerson
operations

* Evaluating the solution package that we could jointly put together for
industrial customers with your Energy Services group and our remotely
controllable transfer switch, UPS and back-up power technologies that would
permit remote (Enron) control of whether a site is on/off the grid or even
selling power back to the grid.

* Evaluate the potential packages of Emerson systems, measuring devices,
control elements, power diagnostic, remote monitoring and visualization
products and technologies for use with Energy Services contract offerings -
- especially in specific vertical markets such as retail stores, grocery
stores, pipelines, paper plants,  semiconductor fabs, etc. We have over 2000
service and solutions people spread throughout USA and other world markets
which could support this effort.

* Enron Broadband Services is already a primary user of Emerson fiber optic
conduit, precision air conditioning, UPS, and other power and connectivity
products and services - - we can evaluate how we can extend our technology
platform to support the bandwidth market making activity and the content
offering of Enron.

* I also see some potential for Enron finance and risk management in
international infrastructure projects such as the Caspian Sea gas
development - - where it looks like there will be 30+ years of gas
production - - some of the local customers who are intrigued with embracing
our new PlantWeb Fields technologies for better yield/uptime/asset
management have had trouble getting conventional project finance resources
to support their projects. Given Enron understands what to do with gas in
kind, there could be a very interesting triangular arrangement with Enron,
Emerson, and local gas production companies.

These are some initial thoughts - - I expect there may be several other
interesting possibilities come to light as we start to have additional
conversations.

Steve, again, thanks for the arrangements yesterday and I will be back to
you shortly to organize a follow-up set of conversations.

Best Regards,

Mike Train

Let's talk.  While there is always some value in these things it is ususally 
quite small and consumes more valuable resources in trying to capture the 
benefit than the benefit itself.

Steve-

We have been approached by the Texas A&M/George Bush Presidential Library 
Foundation and School of Public Policy to endow additional funds.

Enron had made an original contribution to the library foundation back in 
1998 totaling $250K over five years.

I am working with Community Relations and A/A Recruiting to evaluate the 
latest request and to discuss where Enron may have interest or find leverage 
for our Government Affairs, Recruiting, or PR efforts.

The Foundation is willing to work with us to establish whatever type of 
program(s) and/or participatory involvement we would like.  We have discussed 
an Enron speaker series, classroom lectures, advisory committee seats and the 
likes.

I have already had a chance to run this by Rick Shapiro and Rob Bradley.  
Although Rick was noncommittal regarding his team's time for speaking or 
lecturing, he seemed supportive of the effort.  Rob has already been 
participating in some speaking opportunities there, and supported expanded 
efforts.

What are your thoughts on contribution levels (another $250K was suggested by 
CR) and any specific program or relationship opportunities regarding the 
Library Center or School of Public Policy.

Please grab me for quick conversation when you have time.

Thanks.

Mike

With Dereg Under Fire,Enron Calif Elec Business Heats Up
By Jason Leopold

09/14/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- While federal regulators try to find a way to
stabilize soaring wholesale electricity prices in California, Enron Corp.
(ENE) has been quietly striking up deals with some suburban communities to
sell them fixed-price power at a lower rate.

  In the past month, the Houston-based electricity service provider entered
into long-term fixed-rate contracts with the city of Roseville and is
negotiating similar deals with the cities of San Marcos and Chula Vista. Both
of those cities currently get their power from San Diego Gas & Electric Co, a
unit of Sempra Energy Inc. (SRE), and pay market rates for electricity.
  Enron has also struck a deal with Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc.
(HOT), one of the world's largest hospitality companies, to sell the company
electricity at a fixed rate for the next 10 years. The company has four hotels
in California, three of which buy their power from SDG&E.

  Sources close to the matter said Enron has contracted to sell the hotel
power at about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour, compared with the 22.5 cents/KWh
Starwood said it was charged by SDG&E in August.

  Neither company would disclose the terms of the deal. But Starwood said it
expects to reduce its energy costs by more than $200 million over the next 10
years.

  Enron, the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in the U.S., will
purchase power to cover such contracts on the wholesale markets and use its
experience to manage the risks, while paying a fee to utilities like SDG&E for
use of their distribution networks.

  "That really is our core strength," said Harold Buchanan, chief operating
officer for Enron Energy Services North America. "We understand how to manage
those risks."

  High Rates Driving Industrial Customers, Cities To Switch

  The growing interest in fixed-price supply contracts is fueling a comeback
of sorts for Enron.

  The Houston-based company had tried to break into California's retail power
market just after deregulation, even spending nearly $1 million to advertise
the venture during the Super Bowl. But Enron gave up trying to win residential
customers in 1998, citing disappointing response and lower-than-expected
profits.

  That was when deregulation and competitive power markets were full of
promise. Oddly enough, now that deregulation is coming under attack in
California, soaring power prices are building demand for Enron's services.

  The company is fielding calls from large industrial customers in San Diego
that have seen their utility bills triple in the past three months and are
interested in signing long-term fixed-rate contracts, Buchanan said.

  "Overall, what Enron can provide is reliability pricing in San Diego that's
written in stone," Buchanan said. "It's far cheaper than what they're paying
now with the utilities."

  A number of large industrial customers negotiating with Enron declined to
comment.

  The city of Roseville, near Sacramento, entered into a $114 million contract
with Enron last month to purchase 50 megawatts of electricity for five years
at $49 per megawatt-hour.

  Furthermore, the city has started talks with Enron about building and
operating a 750-megawatt natural gas-fired power plant that city officials
expect will contribute to lower costs for the purchase of electricity.

  Mayor Harry Crabb said the plant could protect residents from the price
spikes that have plagued customers of SDG&E since June.

  San Marcos, in San Diego County, is proposing to switch electricity service
for its 10,000 residents to Enron from SDG&E - a move the City Council said
could shave about $12 million a year off the city's power bill. Enron has said
it would offer the city terms nearly identical to those it offered Roseville.

  An SDG&E spokesman said last week that the utility supports such
arrangements, saying they're one way deregulation is supposed to work.

  Enron offered earlier this summer to sell power to SDG&E itself for four
years at a fixed rate of 5.5 cents/KWh, but the utility said the price was too
high.

  California Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation two weeks ago to cap
electricity rates for SDG&E's customers at 6.5 cents/KWh.

 I am recommending Linda Robertson (currently Assistant Secretary for the 
Department of the Treasury) for the position Vice President and General 
Manager of Federal Government Affairs.  Linda would head our Washington, D.C. 
office, replacing Joe Hillings who will be retiring early next year.

 Linda has interviewed with Ken Lay, Tom White, Mike McConnell and Jeff 
Shankman, who join me in this recommendation.

 Attached are biographical information on Linda and a National Journal 
article identifying Linda among the "Washington 100".

 We have conducted extensive reference checks on Linda.  Included among those 
was Secretary Summers who said:

"Nobody I know has the determination she has to get objectives met."
"Far more capacity to grasp the details than anyone I've seen."

 On Monday, I will seek Executive Committee approval to extend the offer to 
Linda.

My message cut off...  The conclusion is that while we continue to need to 
address the kinds of issues laid out in your recommnedations, we need to look 
at solutions which may go deeper to adress our communications problems .. .  
solutions which have become available only recently.  Why not have these guys 
focus on an online training program to both teach people how to make 
information available and accessible (eg by recording information and 
updating on the intranet) and demonstrating the importance of this activity 
to the success of the organization.

I think you and your team have done a fine job dealing with the traditional 
(and perhaps largely insoluble problems) that this group wants to take on.  I 
am pessimistic that the program outlined below will provide anything other 
than marginal improvements.   I am somewhat optimistic, though, that we may 
be able to bypass many of these problems (and get to the heart of what people 
are really complaining about in the survey) by instituting real knowledge 
management at Enron.

Subject: Computer Based Communications Training Initiative

As agreed in our V&V meeting today I have attached two items for your review:
1. A list of those who have been interviewed or have been part of a focus 
group on this subject.

The input from individuals on this list will be the basis for developing the 
5-7 key scenarios that will be a part of the training.  Please let me know if 
you feel we should include more people from your unit to insure that your 
unit's unique circumstances are appropriately taken into account.  If so, let 
us know either their names or how you would like them to be identified.

Some of the individuals on this list will be contacted as Subject Matter 
Experts to help provide real Enron contexts for the scenarios as they are 
further developed.

2. A list of the "first draft" objectives for the program and 10 possible 
scenarios.

Since we will only be able to have a total of about 5-7 scenarios in the 
final version, identify the 5 - 7 on this list of high level scenario ideas 
that will have the most impact on improving communications and the most 
applicability to a range of managers across the Enron organization.  Any 
other feedback you can provide on the objectives or scenarios would be 
greatly appreciated.

We are seeking to move forward with the development of scenarios by the 
beginning of next week.  Therefore, if you could provide your feedback on 
both of the items above by Friday, August 18th, it would be greatly 
appreciated.

		 Subject: Conversation with Wanda Curry


	


Today, Mary Joyce and I met with Wanda Curry.  I realize that there is some 
concern that Wanda is a litigation threat, so for the purposes of soliciting 
legal advice and in anticipation of litigation, I am forwarding my 
recollection of today's meeting to you:

Wanda remains very emotional about what she perceives as "unfair and 
discriminatory" treatment.  When I asked her what she meant specifically (and 
did she intend those terms to have their legal meaning), she said that she 
did not intend the legal meaning of those terms;  rather, she, on  a 
"personal" level,  felt that the company should have treated her better.  She 
mentioned specifically: that no one ever called to explain in detail why she 
had not been further promoted at Enron or given more responsibility at Enron, 
that she viewed the job in Sally Beck's organization as unsatisfactory 
(because Sally should be treated as a peer, not a superior), and that she 
felt as though she did not have the support of upper management of the 
company.
I described several options for her:
Take the job she was offered in Sally Beck's organization;
Take the job in Rick Buy's organization (I said I would have to talk to Rick 
again)
Take severence under the standard package;
Take severence as a "business reorg" but consult with Enron for a period.
At first she seemed most interested in the fourth option (although she wasn't 
particularly happy about any of the  alternatives), but at the end of the 
discussion expressed interest in the second option.
A large part of the conversation involved discussion of Wanda's complaints 
about how she had been treated.  Most of Wanda's concerns focussed on jobs 
she did not get, or jobs she felt were taken from her, reduced scope of 
control, and the fact that she felt that her supervisors did not communicate 
with her sufficiently prior to or subsequent to making their decisions about 
job assignments.  I suggested that there were likely two sides to the story 
and that most of the problem was insufficient communication or perhaps some 
insensitivity.  I also pointed out that in all my conversations I heard good 
things about her performance and had no indication that anyone had treated 
her unfairly.
Wanda did complain about many things, but never once complained about her pay 
at Enron.

Mary, these are my recollections from today.  Do you have anything to add?

OUR CURRENT energy problems are urgent and serious. But before the governor 
and the Public Utilities Commission cut yet another deal costing consumers 
billions of dollars, perhaps they should pause to ask the public what kind of 
system it wants and what it will end up with after investing billions more. 
Failure of energy deregulation could speed real deregulation that might 
benefit consumers with real capacity and real competition. But this will not 
happen if the focus is only on California utilities and their shareholders. 
The original deregulation deal was designed, as I see it, to keep competition 
out of California -- and to maximize the rates consumers would pay for every 
bad past business decision by PG&E and other California utilities. 
Similarly, current bailout discussions are about forcing California 
ratepayers to pay for the failed deregulation plan designed by the utilities 
themselves. Once again, the companies seek to maximize profits and socialize 
the losses. 
Following on the heels of California's deregulation, the state's utilities 
came to the congressional delegation and urged us to protect the plan from 
federal deregulation efforts. They argued that the deal they cut was good for 
all parties. Their executives repeated time and again that they might benefit 
from the plan's cap on consumer prices -- and that there was a risk to them 
if wholesale prices were to go up. 
This, they told us, is the marketplace. They were willing to absorb the risk. 
This was the brave new world of free markets. 
But markets are never free. From the beginning, this deregulation plan was 
designed to buy the California utilities time and advantage. Initially, 
consumers saw lower rates, but not as low as real competition might have 
provided when compared to the heavily sheltered market of the past five 
years. Now, because this rigged marketplace has failed, the utilities want 
again to put their hands into the ratepayers' pockets. 
At first, PG&E and Southern California Edison asked the Public Utilities 
Commission to have California consumers pay the entire cost of deregulation's 
risks. Their idea did not pass the smell or the laugh test. 
Now the utilities look for a way to repackage their old proposal, including a 
substantial rate increase. The rationale is that the utilities may collapse 
financially. This threat is supposed to inspire Gov. Gray Davis and the PUC 
to quickly put the ratepayer on the hook for the utilities' failures. 
During the past year, dozens of utilities have merged all across America. 
PG&E, for example, may not be worth much to its shareholders, but like AT&T, 
it may be worth something to its competitors. This is the genius of the 
American marketplace. 
PG&E shareholders bought the stock, assuming the risk. Why should the 
ratepayers be asked to insulate them from that risk? During this past year, 
tens of billions of dollars of market capitalization were lost by various 
Silicon Valley high-tech firms. Their shareholders do not get the benefit of 
going to the PUC and getting a taxpayer bailout. 
The ratepayer has already paid for this energy under a contract that 
utilities struck with the people of the state of California. Any additional 
payment by the ratepayer is a financial bailout. Any prudent investor would 
ask what the return will be before handing over billions of dollars. The 
ratepayer deserves an answer, as well as some equity or other consideration.

Congratulations on your appointment by Fox.  That's great news.  I continue 
to be impressed by the way Fox is handling things.  Let me know what I can do 
to help.  As you know we are looking for a replacement for the unreplaceable 
Ricardo Charvel.  I know you and he have discussed some possibilities.  Rick 
Shapiro has met several candidates and will be bringing two to Houston in the 
next week or so.

Dr. Kean continues to improve her golf game while I slave away at Enron to

Dear Jeff,

Thank you for inviting me to participate in the energy policy forum event
in Washington, DC on October 3-4.  Ordinarily, I would be happy to
participate.  However, my wife is scheduled to have hip surgery (#2) on
October 1.  Judging from the last time she went through this I will have to
stay around until she is out of the hospital and settled back at home.
Accordingly, I am not planning any travel before October 10.  Too bad.

On another matter, can you ask someone in your energy services company to
get in touch with me?  I would like to set something up with MIT's
executive VP in charge of the business side of running MIT, including
energy purchases and management.  We have a 22 MW cogenerator, buy gas and
electricity at wholesale and use lots of heating and cooling on an ever
growing campus with 8,000 students, as many employees, many computer
facilities and laboratories.  I'm sure that we can do it more efficiently
and I have been encouraging the management to look for opportunities to
out-source some or all of these activities.  I would like to put them in
touch with someone at Enron.

Thanks

Paul

congratulations!

One thing to add to the arguments:  we have to make the adverse effect on 
consumers the centerpiece of our arguments.  We need the legal arguments too, 
but this is fundamentally a political and consumer protection driven 
discussion.  We have to be prepared to demonstrate that the key to Alberta 
reducing prices is allowing new generation to enter and to do that you have 
to allow a true market price to be posted.  California has seen the 
cancellation of numerous projects while they remain desparate for new supply 
because they have tried to artificially constrain prices.  That's not good 
for consumers.  If they need a lower cost solution for consumers (or 
protection from price volatility in the meantime) they need to "outsource" 
the residential supply business in blocks for fixed price bids.

Regardless of how we frame the arguments, or the solutions, however, we have 
to make the public policy/ consumer protection arguments the center of our 
written and oral presentations.

Do you agree?

		 Subject: Update - Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes

Dale McMaster called this afternoon to advise that the Power Pool Council 
agreed to delay any decision on the recently proposed rule changes (importers 
excluded from setting pool price and dispatch risk) for a period of two 
weeks.  During this two week period Dale has been asked to obtain stakeholder 
input into ways to address concerns about whether the spot price in the 
Alberta Power Pool is a product of interaction among competitiors in a 
efficient market.   

In our discussions with the Power Pool and ADRD today and yesterday Enron 
expressed its willingness to work with the Power Pool to provide feedback on 
suggested rule changes but has also made it clear that we do not agree with 
the premise that there is a "problem" that requires "emergency" amendments to 
the Pool rules.  Our position has been that Alberta is short supply, and 
significant changes to the rules and/or market design will only discourage 
new generation development. 

Dale McMaster had just left the Power Pool Council meeting when he called and 
had not yet put much thought into how to define the issue he has to address 
and what the process will be.   We discussed the process and it appears he 
will likely receive comments from stakeholders at large and also assemble a 
small committee of 4-5 stakeholders (which would include Enron) to work with 
the Power Pool to consider possible changes to the Pool rules.  Dale said he 
would try to pull together a "terms of reference" document that would define 
the mandate of the small committee by tomorrow.

After my call with Dale McMaster, Peter Keohane and I spoke to Aleck Trawick 
and we have asked Blakes to assist us in three areas:

1) Once the terms of reference of this small committee are released (and 
assuming Enron is asked to participate on the committee) Blakes will assist 
us with preparing a letter that states that Enron's participation does not 
represent acknowledgement or agreement that the Power Pool Rules must be 
amended to address the concerns of some stakeholders about real time pricing 
in Alberta and that Enron's participation on the committee is on a without 
prejudice basis;

2) Enron needs to obtain the final memo from Frontier Economics in which 
Frontier provides its opinion on how the proposed rule changes: i) would 
introduce price discrimination into the Alberta electricity market, ii) would 
be contrary to the development of an efficient, fair and openly competitive 
market for electricity, iii) would compromise the independence of the Power 
Pool, and iv) would have the expected effect of artificially depressing the 
real time price of electricity in Alberta.  Once Blakes receives a copy of 
the Frontier Economics memo, they will prepare a memo for Enron advising: i) 
whether the two week process of consultation by the Power Pool is in 
accordance with the standards required of the PPC as an administrative 
tribunal operating in Alberta; and ii) whether such rule changes offend the 
provisions of the EUA;

3) Blakes will advise Enron of the possible avenues of recourse (i.e. appeal 
to the AEUB, and/or legal action in the Court of Queen's Bench) in the event 
the proposed rule changes (or similar changes) are approved by the PPC at the 
end of this two week period.   GPC and Eric Thode will also be consulted on 
this issue and obviously input from all those within Enron working on this 
project will be sought prior to any decision being made to pursue any 
possible legal remedies.  

Please advise if you have any comments.

Regards,

Rob

the commission it will also be served on the parties.  We plan to talk to the 
press about it as well.  A number of other companies and organizations are 
also submitting letters and we have helped prepare an EPSA filing which 
focusses specifically on California.  Our best information at this point is 
that the FERC staff report regarding California is generally accurate, and 
therefore, favorable.  While it will mention periodic exercises of market 
power, it is expected to lay blame for California's woes at the feet of 
California's own decisions about market structure.  It is further expected 
that the report will not provide a basis for ordering refunds.  On the other 
hand, the Commission's order (to be considered tomorrow along with the 
staff's report) is expected to at least put refunds on the table for comment 
and to discuss, and perhaps implement, further price caps.  This is just our 
best guess at this point.  the Commission has put special emphasis on putting 
the report and order under wraps until wednesday.

URGENT

The Associate and Analyst Recruiting Department will be conducting a number 
of two hour workshops to review our recruiting and interview process for the 
fall on-campus recruiting effort.  Critical information regarding our 
on-campus interview process, revised evaluation forms and program structure 
will be reviewed during these two hours sessions.

It is mandatory that all team members attend these workshops.  All team 
members must attend in order to articulate and demonstrate the Enron 
recruiting process.  Knowing how busy schedules are, we have made 
arrangements to present these workshops in two hours sessions for a total of  
40 workshops that will run during the last week of August, through the month 
of September and end at mid October.

Listed below are the dates, location and times for each session.  Please 
select a date and time and e-mail this information to my assistant, Dolores 
Muzzy.  We can accommodate 25 participants at a time.  Dolores will take 
dates and times on a first come, first serve basis.  We have scheduled enough 
sessions to accommodate every member of both the Associate and Analyst 
recruiting teams.

In order to participate in the recruiting process, you must attend one of 
these sessions.  We will be tracking participation.  CPE credits will also be 
given for attending this workshop.

I would hold off for now.  I think, based on our discussion, that Ira might 
be a fit for my organization or EES.  Unfortunately, I am heading out of town 
with my family on the 12th (unfortunate for meeting with Ira , not 
unfortunate for me) and EES has new leadership who is trying to assess the 
state of things before making new senior level hires.  So, let's wait a bit.  
Thanks

Help -- pls help me to unscramble my calendar.
We had discussed Ira Jolles, now a vp and general counsel of GPU, due to 
resign when its merger is completed and the execs move to some God foresaken 
place in Ohio, or some such state. Ira is smart; innovatived; honorable; very 
knowledgeable about Pa. Nj, NY and Ferc regulation. In short, like no other 
utility executive I have met. He would be perfect for Enron, perhaps 
operating out of one of your offices in one of the states I have mentioned. 
You said that you would set up meetings with the appropriate people in 
Houston, and I propose April 12 -- I would stay over after our meeting and do 
the introductions. PLS let me know that this is ok.

Ken & Jeff,

We would like to extend an invitation to you for an event at the Guggenheim 
Museum in New York, honoring the Frank Gehry Exhibit which Enron is 
sponsoring.   Frank Gehry, a celebrated architect whose building appears at 
the end of our Ode to Why commercial, personifies innovation in the way he 
has "asked why," challenging nearly every convention in his field. 

Enron will have a table of 10 at the Trustee Opening Gala Dinner on May 16th, 
with cocktails at 7pm and a seated dinner at 8:30pm.  The Gala starts with a 
private viewing of the exhibition, followed by a seated dinner for 280 people 
in the Rotunda of the museum. Attendees are comprised of Trustees, government 
dignitaries, artists, curators and celebrities.  

Several business unit executives are using this forum to take potential 
customers and we would like to know if you are interested in attending. 
Please advise. 

Thanks, Steve

		 Subject: FERC at Enron -- Dec. 7

The following illustrious FERC group will be with us on 31 the morning of 
Dec. 7.  They have asked to have a demonstration in detail of EPMI's systems 
that track OASIS and market information.  Many of them have not seen EOL, so 
we need to show them that as well.

The fact that this group is made up of so many FERC office directors means 
that this visit comes at the request of the Chairman Hoecker.  They will be 
visiting Dynegy and El Paso later that day.

They are definitely interested in a good presentation from Enron, as we have 
given them in the past -- primarily because they met so many senior Enron 
executives.  It would be great if Dave Delainey or John Lavorato could also 
come by to meet them.

Thanks.

Subject: Some Background on California Gas Price Spikes--The Other Side of 
the Story

Last week, I distributed a presentation that the Brattle Group gave before 
the California Inquisition (i.e., legislative gas oversight committee looking 
into the gas price spikes at the Cal border).  

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up 
on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned 
power plants).  Edison "arranged" for the Brattle Group to be the star 
witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and 
Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their 
message was simple (and simplistic):

El Paso and Dynegy have market power.
They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas 
at the border (to "obscene" levels).
That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.

Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide 
the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets 
any questions on the topic.  It's attached.  Apologies, it's quick and dirty, 
but it provides the basics.

Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to 
offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California 
Legislature is peddling.

Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the 
California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis 
when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of 
the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

Best,
Jeff

While the more-open gas market may have more tools available than in electric 
markets, market solutions have been proposed as an alternative to legislated 
rate caps in the hard hit San Diego market.

Gavin -- please send Irwin copies of the articles on the offers made in San 
Diego.

The WSJ report of 8-23 on the power/price situation in Con Ed's territory 
contains the following: "And the tools to hedge prices, such as those that 
exist in other commodities markets, aren't fully developed yet for th 
fledgling deregulated electricity industry."
That might be worthy of comment in my talk. Anything I should see on the 
subject?

I think it would be useful to verify their view that they are really only 2-3 
years from commercial production.  Ideally, we could get that confirmation 
from someone familiar with the technology but without any financial interest 
in its success.  Their technology pitch sounded good, but I don't know enough 
to recognize the potential shortcomings.  I want to feel comfortable that you 
all feel this is real, then I would be happy to have me and my team spend 
some time with them.

Thank you for participating in yesterday's meeting.  We spoke with Harvey and 
Jim after the meeting and they took to speed to market comments to heart.  
There is an opportunity for Enron to participate with MEC in the early 
development of their company, but it seems the one thing they want is the one 
thing we also want, people.  I would appreciate your thoughts and comments on 
the possiblity of creating a small team that could work directly with MEC as 
part of a potential investment and strategic relationship.  Given our 
resource constraints, this would most likely be part of the organization that 
sees the greatest strategic impact from MEC's development.

Steve we briefly discussed last Tuesday the possibility of using Mr Lay's 
contact with the Chairman of Toyota, Mr Okuda, to assist us in securing a 
senior executive from Toyota to speak at the May 15 conference in Tokyo.  

We agreed that I should draft a letter for Jeff Skilling to send to Mr Okuda. 
I have had a rethink and believe that as a matter of courtesy (Japanese 
style), it would be preferable in the first instance if the contact with Mr 
Okuda is done from chairman to chairman. Mr Lay's letter will serve as an 
introduction to Jeff Skilling, and will also permit Enron Japan to follow up 
directly with Mr Okuda's staff in Japan. We can then draft a letter for Jeff 
Skilling to confirm arrangements.

I attach a draft letter for that purpose. If the revised approach is in 
order, I will liaise on the matter with Rosalee and Sherri, with a copy to 
you.

The conversation was very positive (Glynn did not know anything about it at 
first, but, looked into it and called Ken back Friday evening).  Glynn said 
they were including the amount owed in their negotiations over the price for 
the transmission assets and said they intended to pay all of their debts, 
including this one, as soon as they get paid.  He said that this weekk would 
be focussed on finalizing a deal for SCE given the threat of bankruptcy; the 
discussions would then turn to PG&E.

What people know:

Hertzberg (et al's) bill (82XX)was heard in an "informational" hearing today 
and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be heard again 
tomorrow (perhaps beginning at 10 AM) , at which time parties will have a 
chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.  Most, including us, oppose 
unless significantly amended.
The Wright (D) -Richman (R) bill (83XX)was heard in an "informational" 
hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be 
heard again tomorrow, at which time parties will have a chance to 
support/oppose and ask for amendments.  From our perspective, this is the 
best bill out there yet, though it still has serious problems---it isn't 
available electronically yet, but should be tomorrow, and I'll distribute 
then.  The chances of the joint D-R bill being successful are slim, however, 
since it's up against the Speakers competing bill.  There is talk that the 
Speaker will try to negotiate with Wright/Richman tonight and include any 
agreement in his bill (82XX).
The original version of the Governor's MOU bill sits in the Senate.  Most 
believe that Burton will put it up for a vote this week and it will fail.
The Senate's version of the MOU (Sher-Peace-Kuehl) (78XX)came out today.  It 
will likely be heard in the committee tomorrow or the next day.  Notably, it 
kills Direct Access completely and makes Edison shareholders responsible for 
that portion of Edison's debt owed to suppliers.  In short, a very bad bill.
Burton's 18XX, which would de-link the bond issuance (to pay back the General 
Fund) from the DWR contracts is likely to pass the Senate tomorrow or the 
next day.  Many--including Enron--support the bill (though we are supporting 
it behind the scenes).

What people don't know:
Whether there's the time or the will in the Assembly and Senate to achieve by 
Friday a single, comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his 
signature. 
Whether the Legislature would postpone its month-long recess if the 
Legislature hasn't finished a bill by Friday (most folks think they will not 
postpone).
Whether it's true that, irrespective of the energy issue, the Legislature 
will fail to get the budget completed by Friday and therefore have to 
postpone their recess anyway, in which case they might continue to work on 
the energy legislation at the same time.

Odds-makers still say it's better than 50-50 that the Legislature does not 
get the Edison bills done by Friday and leaves on on its 30-day vacation.

Best,
Jeff

		 Subject: Economics Study on Proposed Houston SIP--Preliminary Results

You might mark your calendar for a lunch (12-1:30) at the Hyatt downtown on 
Wednesday December 13 where Barton Smith of UH and George Tolley of the U. of 
Chicago will present the findings of their economic study.  The Houston Forum 
event will be part of the Kenneth L. Lay Lecture Series in Global Economics 
at the University of Houston.  (I will have a table for Enron.)

The authors presented their preliminary results to us this week, and the 
total benefits of the planned ozone reduction (all SIP measures as currently 
proposed) are below $100 million (we are indoors most of the time that bad 
air days are occurring since it is typically very hot), and the costs are 
around $5 billion out to 2010.   Lots of caveats to this conclusion including 
the assumption of today's best technology but no more.  The high costs 
include a "last mile" problem that the proposal of the Partnership's Business 
Coalition for Clean Air (BCCA) avoids (such as no noon-to-midnight 
construction, a 75% average point source reduction to allow for trading and 
future permits instead of a 90% reduction, etc.).

The effect on Houston is to reduce our forecast economic growth but not 
eliminate it.  Real wages are forecast to fall by some 5% or more under the 
current SIP versus without it.  Total job loss will be over 100,000--about a 
1 and a half years of growth out to 2010.   This "shock" will be around 
one-half of what Houston went through after the oil price crash in 1986 
according to Dr. Smith.  One might say that slower growth and spreading the 
pollution around (some of our refinery/petrochemical growth going elsewhere) 
is not the end of the world, however, if a more cost-effective SIP is chosen.

It will be several weeks before the results are final (and the election 
over), at which time an executive summary will be released.  The Mayor's 
office and TNRCC will be briefed first.  The luncheon will be the formal 
unveiling of the study with explanation, but I expect press coverage of the 
study next month.

As head of the economics working group, I have tried to ensure that a 
top-notch analysis was done without an industry bias.  The results are 
considered conservative by the authors all things considered and in line with 
the peer-reviewed literature on costs and benefits.  The study is not 
intended to be a "whining" study but to give us realistic expectations and to 
(naturally) bring into review some "last mile" problems where certain SIP 
measures are the least cost effective.

These preliminary results are confidential given the political cycle we are 
in and should not be shared externally.

		 Subject: Alberta Pool Rule Changes

Unfortunately, today in an unprecedented move the Alberta Government 
over-ruled the Power Pool on its decision yesterday not to amend the Power 
Pool Rules and exclude importers from setting pool price.  The Minister 
signed a regulation under the Electric Utilities Act that excludes imports 
from influencing the determination of the pool price.   The Power Pool has 
been tasked to work out the mechanics of implementing the regulation.  Larry 
Charach advised that this move was made by the politicians in the face of 
advice not to do it from Larry.   Apparently the Premier met with 
representatives of Alberta farmers yesterday and also learned of what the 
Government considers to be excessive pricing being offered by  Enmax (the 
City of Calgary owned retailer) that included: 1 Year (on-peak) $190/Mwh Cdn, 
1 Year (all-hours) $137/Mwh Cdn.   

Peter Keohane and I have a meeting tomorrow morning with lawyers from 
Blakes.  The present thinking is that we need to get legal advice on whether 
we need to   send a letter to the Government indicating that Enron believes 
this action to be contrary to the provisions of the EUA prior to our 
participating in the MAP Auction on Monday and Tuesday.  The fear is that our 
conduct of pursuing new commercial opportunities in this market may somehow 
estop us from later arguing the new regulation is ultra vires the EUA.   
Notwithstanding the advice we get on this point, there is agreement here 
(Milnthorp and Keohane) that if we do send a letter it must not include a 
paragraph threatening to sue the Alberta Government. 

Regards,

Rob

Steve,

I don't want to get caught in a crossfire here, so I thought your group could 
give me some guidance.  

I think the referendum is very important for the city and will help us 
continue to show Houston as a significant metropolitan area.  I am not 
convinced that the ultimate form of the deal for minority participation in 
Enron Field was, in fact, what was intended.  In that agreement, Aramark owns 
all of the concessions, but has a 30% profit share with minorities.  My 
understanding is that there are no minority owned businesses in that deal.

I would like to communicate this sentiment, but I would also, certainly like 
to reinforce Enron's position.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject: Downtown Arena- HHCC asked to give public comments to Construction 
Committee this week


Dear Board Member-

As you may already know, we have been working with the Harris County-Houston
Sports Authority to have included in their agreement with the Houston
Rockets a 30% minority participation goal in the design, construction and
operation of a downtown basketball arena.  This is the same commitment that
we received from the Rockets in 1999.  We received a commitment from the
sports authority and the mayor's office that the minority participation goal
of 30% will be included in the contract.  We have met with Celena Garza and
communicated with Al Luna our interests and they have expressed their
support for our position.  We have also asked Sen. Mario Gallegos for his
support and received it.

We are in the process of confirming that our language calling for such goal
has been included in the final document and that Al Luna and Celena Garza
are sufficiently satisfied with the language, which will be voted on later
this week.

Once confirmed, Sonny Flores, Chairman of the Economic Development Committee
has recommended to Massey that the Chamber be prepared to offer some sort of
public statement in support or not supporting a referendum to build the
arena.  (We have been asked to address the Construction Committee of the
sports authority by Billy Burge and Wayne Smith)  Sonny has indicated that
once we have a confirmation from Al and Celena, our interests should be
sufficiently covered and that supporting the referendum would be good for
Hispanic businesses.

Massey has asked that I poll the board for its input and get a majority
commitment from the board so as to move forward in offering support or no
support for the referendum.  Ordinarily, this would be discussed and
considered at a meeting of the Board of Directors, however, since the sports
authority posted its meeting notice (72 hours prior to meeting) and is ready
to proceed with its approval of the Letter Agreement with the Houston
Rockets we are seeking input in this manner.

I am attaching a copy of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Chamber
and the Sports Authority for you review.  There have been no revisions to
the last copy that was circulated at the past Executive Committee meeting at
Tony Grijalva's office.

Massey has asked that you respond with your input, suggestions and position
for or not for the chamber offering its support for the arena via e-mail
within 24 hours of this notice.  The chamber's position will be determined
by the majority of those respondents to this e-mail by no later than 4:00
p.m. CDT on Wednesday, August 2, 2000.

Sherrie and Rosie:  Jeff and Ken both received notes from Tom Delay about 
designating portions of their contributions for use  in Texas.  Mr. DeLay 
would like them to make that designation using the letter below (note that it

Carolyn and Cynthia,

       You should write this letter on your letter head and direct it to Joe
Jaso and copy Tom DeLay, Jim Ellis, and myself. All funds where money could
be left in the State of Texas from corporate and personal should be included.

Dear Joe:

       Enron, Mr. Ken Lay and Mr. Skilling are requesting that their
contribution be matched per our understanding from the fax and verbal
communications from Warren RoBold. This totals $100,000 between both
individuals and the Corporation for the RNSEC matching funds program. We want
these funds matched in time for the Texas State deadlines. It was our
intention from the onset of this program to have our funds go to this
account. The various points of contact from the RNC caused some minor
confusion so checks went to Texas instead of DC. This is very important to
Mr. Lay and Mr. Shilling.
        Let us know if we need to request these funds returned and new checks
written and mailed to you at your DC address. You may call me if you have any
questions.

I think this is a fine attempt, but I continue to believe that a pure 
relative ranking offers the most flexibility and is more like the way the 
process works in practice.  A separate list of desired behaviors, criteria 
etc can be used to guide discussion but I believe the ranking itself should 
remain purely relative.

Subject: descriptors again

Dick; here is another try at the descriptors.  I tried to apply the 
information you provided and to describe qualities of an employee's 
performance . I'm  not sure whether this is any better, but would appreciate 
your input.  What I am finding most challenging writing descriptors which are 
interchangeable with all levels and job groups within the company.  The 
behaviors these describe and measure need to be general in nature so that 
they can apply to a VP and an admin assistant, as well as to all four Peer 
Groups within Enron.  

Likewise, I would appreciate your thoughts on the necessity/value of changing 
the feedback forms to reflect the same numerical ratings.  presently the 
feedback forms use the same descriptors as the cluster (i.e. Superior - 
Issues).  In your opinion should these also be 1-5 ratings with one = to 
highest and 5= to lowest in scale?  
I look forward to hearing your thoughts and impressions.  You may either 
e-mail me or call me on 713 345-3377.  Many thanks in advance, Gina

We move alot of people around Enron.  In fact, on an annual basis, we make 
about 8400 moves (out of a Houston employee base of 11000).  We have found at 
Enron that putting people next to eachother makes things happen: increased 
productivity and communication.  Given our tight office situation in Houston, 
moving people around to make room for new and expanding businesses has caused 
some disruption.  We try to keep it to a minimum and expect it to improve 
later this year when we begin occupying the new building.

Has Enron looked at the financial expense as well as the emotional, morale 
and business expenses associated with constantly moving people from one 
location to another in the Enron building?  Maybe we could use these savings 
and redirect them for our bonuses?

I think Jeff should be the point person on putting the response together on 
this (and future air and climate change position inquiries).  Jeff - please 
make sure you get the comments of all involved.

Subject: Re: Greenpeace letters to Enron Europe concerning our position on 
Kyoto  

All:  I would like to discuss how we might respond to this letter from 
Greenpeace, if at all.  The letter is attached way at the bottom of this 
e-mail, and was received in several Enron European offices as a copy of what 
was sent to Jeff Skilling and other CEOs of major companies.  I have not 
confirmed our receipt of such a letter from any of you, but am assuming it 
was delivered.

I think we could respond in a very positive, constructive manner to 
Greenpeace, based on the statements we've already documented and the 
strategies we are developing.  Lisa Jacobson and I are currently working on 
developing some tighter climate change and clean air "messages" that we can 
use in multiple areas ASAP -- upcoming Ken Lay speeches and interactions with 
the Administration, revising the Statement for the 2001 Corporate 
Responsibility Report, Enron Business articles and other internal uses, 
responses to environmental group inquiries and shareholder meeting Q&A, and 
use in everyday speeches and advocacy work.

The Greenpeace questions are tricky, and set up no-win answers for the most 
part.  I doubt they will get any direct answers to questions like:  "Does 
your company support President Bush in his opposition to the protocol?"   In 
my opinion, we can respond to Greenpeace without directly responding to these 
types of questions.  Addressing Kyoto directly is a slippery slope -- its 
best to stick with the solution-oriented approach we've always taken.

For this reason, I was a bit concerned to see in the e-mail chain below a 
characterization of Mark Palmer's statement on Kyoto (given to Jackie Gentile 
in London) -- "Enron has always taken the view that the Kyoto protocol was 
not a workable solution to dealing with CO2 emissions.  However it is not the 
principles behind Kyoto that we take issue with, rather it is the vehicle 
that has been devised to deliver the results."  I believe it is dangerous to 
make such statements for a number of reasons -- Greenpeace would absolutely 
beat us over the head with it, Friends of the Earth could step up its 
shareholder initiatives, etc.    Also, this sets you up for a number of 
follow up questions that I don't think we have answers to, like:  What about 
Kyoto is not workable?  What would make it workable and would we help make it 
workable?  If not Kyoto, what is Enron's preferred "vehicle?"  I'd really 
rather stay with a constructive, solution-oriented approach and avoid 
reference to Kyoto altogether.

I will talk with Kate Bauer in Enron Europe about this, but I think we need 
to decide on a global, corporate-wide response to Greenpeace.   I would be 
happy to set up a quick conference call on the subject, or just field 
comments by e-mail -- whatever works best.

Thoughts?

Thanks Kate. Please keep Nailia Dindarova in my Brussels office and me
copied on responses since I will be co-ordinating any pronouncements on
this topic in Europe in policymakers' circles. For them neither the
negativity nor the vagueness of the words you quote below (on which Mark
and Jackie already know my views!) will be adequate.

Subject:  Re: Greenpeace letters to Enron in the Netherlands and Spain re
      our position on Kyoto

Lauren

Further to my telephone message today, I would be grateful for your view on
the approach we should be taking to the issue of Greenpeace sending letters
to our European offices re: Kyoto. Several of our offices (Spain, Belgium,
Netherlands) have received a local language version of the letter
originally sent to Jeff Skilling, and other CEOs, on 5 April 2001. The
email chain below gives an indication of what is in circulation.

Greenpeace is expecting a response within the next week. Jackie Gentle has
made me the point of contact in the PR department for this issue. We have
discussed this issue briefly and we would support issuing an initial
statement to acknowledge receipt of the letters, perhaps followed by a
standardised, corporate- approved letter, but would like to ensure our
approach is supported, and consistent with any actions, by Corporate. As
some of the countries in which we operate have tangible "green" focused
projects e.g. we have acquired a wind project in The Netherlands, it may be
appropriate to allow such countries to personalise their response in local
language.

If we follow up an initial acknowledgement with a fuller response to
Greenpeace's questions, I suggest we consider the following issues raised
recently by Jackie Gentle:

"In response to several requests for clarification, I have spoken with Mark
Palmer who has provided the following information on Enron's stance
regarding Kyoto:

Enron has always taken the view that the Kyoto protocol was not a workable
solution to dealing with CO2 emissions.  However it is not the principles
behind Kyoto that we take issue with, rather it is the vehicle that has
been devised to deliver the results.

We firmly believe that there is work to be done in reducing greenhouse
gases and Enron has put in place a number of programs that have measurably
reduced carbon dioxide as well as SO2 and Oxides of Nitrogen (Nox)

By way of example ....
   emissions trading programs have been put in place where these can be
   implemented
   Enron is one of the largest developers of natural gas-fired power plants
   which produce about 50 percent less carbon dioxide than coal or
   oil-fired plants
   demand-side management programs through EES to reduce energy usage
   the Catalytica program
   focus on renewable-related projects

At the current time there is no formal statement from Enron Corp on the
Kyoto issue."

Before we proceed, I would be grateful if you could contact me to share
your views on this.

Many thanks.
Best regards
Kate

Please find below the Greenpeace letter our Dutch office received today (as

is before 26 April.  I am asking our PR agency in the NL to translate the
letter asap.

In the mean time, I will wait for direction on our official corporate
response on this issue and then discuss suitability or possible adaptation
for the Dutch market or for this letter in particular.

I have advised Hans-Mart to make sure all employees in the Dutch office do
not reply to any calls or queries re the above ubject and to refer them to
me.

Thanks

Thanks for the note.  I am forwarding it on to our analyst and associate 
recruiting program leaders.  We may have already filled the summer spots (we 
also cut  down the number  a bit this year to ensure a higher quality 
experience), but we will be out looking for a large number of permanent hires 
in the Fall.

Dear Steve:

Jim Bushnell and I are teaching a course called "Energy Market Strategies
and Policies" this semester.  The course is cross-listed between the Haas
School of Business and the Energy & Resources Group at UC Berkeley.  The
syllabus for the course is attached.

We have 43 graduate students in the course, most pursuing a masters degree
in business or energy & resources, though there are also a few PhD
students.  These are very smart students -- many of whom already have
experience in the energy industries -- and we believe the course puts them
in a position to immediately contribute to any energy-related organization
that they would join.

Many of these students are interested in either summer or permanent
employment starting as early as May.  If Enron has openings that you would
like to advertise to these students, please send me the job description
(or the URL for it)and I can forward it to the class list.

Jim and I think this is a very strong class, and many of the students are
interested in making a career in either the business or the public policy 
side of
the energy industry.  We're hoping to provide the connections to help make 
sure
they find the best job matches possible.

Sincerely,
Severin

Subject: Presidential Power Question

I spoke with Donna Bobbish this morning about Steve's question -- does the 
President have broader authority to take action during times of crisis.  
Donna sent me this quick write up about what she has looked into so far.  
Because these questions go beyond a FERC practitioner's expertise, we asked 
Donna to work with a Constitutional Law expert at V&E to determine whether, 
and under what circumstances, the President's authority may be extended 
beyond the authorities discussed in the memo.  

We will let you know what we learn from that further research.

Sarah:  In response to Steve's inquiry, I did look into this question
briefly when you first gave me the assignment.  I read an interesting law
review article  on "The Imposition of Martial Law in the United States," for
a discussion of presidential powers.  There is no general emergency
authority granted the President in the U.S.  Constitution.  Also, the
article discussed the famous "Truman steel mills case," Youngstown Sheet &
Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), in which the Supreme Court declared
unconstitutional President Truman's seizure of the steel mills during the
Korean War.  In that case, in light of a threatened national-wide strike in
the national steel industry, President Truman, concerned about the national
defense, issued an Executive Order directing the Secretary of Commerce to
take possession of most of the steel mills and keep them running.  The
Supreme Court said that if the President had authority to take such  an
action, he had to derive it either from an act of Congress or the
Constitution itself.  Since the Supreme Court could not find any seizure
authority, it invalidated the President's action.  The Supreme Court also
rejected the argument that the President had any powers that could be
implied from the aggregate of his powers under the Constitution.

Based on the Truman steel mills case, I thought it the wiser course of
action to look for specific authorities given to the President by statute
which might prove useful.

I could look into this question further, if you would like, but we would be
entering "martial law-type" legal territory, where the President would be
acting outside of specific Constitutional or congressional authority (which
has been described a "zone of twilight"), and in light of the Truman steel
mills case, I don't know how fruitful that might be.

Please let me know if you would like me to do anything more.  Thank you.

Attached is an article that we have drafted with the help of a McK
Quarterly editor.   We have set up a call for tomorrow at 10:00  (CST) in
order to talk through the article and the implications to our clients.  We
have received very good and constructive comments from many of you which we
have tried to incorporate (as much as a 750 word limit would allow).  We
believe we have a shot at a Monday op-ed piece in the WSJ if we send this
out Friday.  The events of today highlight the timeliness of this issue.
Looking forward to talking to you tomorrow.

Steven,

Thank you for visiting with my class at Rice last night. They thoroughly
enjoyed your talk -- after you left for the evening, we had a good
discussion on topics that you had raised. My apologies again for the room
mix up; somehow between myself, the university, and my secretary, the
classroom assignment changed several times and the update did not get to
you.

Next year, if your schedule permits, perhaps you would consider a return
engagement. I would certainly enjoy having you back.

Sanjay: Some information of possible interest to you. I attended a meeting 
this afternoon of the Coalition of Service Industries, one of the lead groups 
promoting a wide range of services including energy services in the upcoming 
WTO GATTS 2000 negotiations. CSI President Bob Vastine was in Delhi last week 
and met with CII to discuss the upcoming WTO. CII apparently has a committee 
looking into the WTO. Bob says that he told them that energy services was 
among the CSI recommendations and he recalls that CII said that they too have 
an interest.

Since returning from the meeting I spoke with Kiran Pastricha and told her 
the above. She actually arranged the meeting in Delhi. She asked that I send 
her the packet of materials we distributed last week in Brussels and London. 
One of her associates is leaving for India tomorrow and will take one of 
these items to Delhi.

Subject: India And The WTO Services Negotiation

Sanjay: First some information and then a request for your advice and 
involvment.

A group of US companies and associations formed the US WTO Energy Services 
Coalition in late May and has asked the US Government to include "energy 
services" on their proposed agenda when the first meeting of the WTO GATTS 
2000 ministerial convenes late this year in Seattle. Ken Lay will be among 
the CEO speakers. These negotiations are expected to last three years and 
cover a range of subjects including agriculture, textiles, e-commerce, 
investment, etc.

This morning I visited with Sudaker Rao at the Indian Embassy to tell him 
about our coalition and to seek his advice on possible interest of the GOI. 
After all, India is a leader in data processing matters and has other 
companies including ONGC that must be interested in exporting energy 
services. In fact probably Enron and other US companies may be engaging them 
in India and possibly abroad.

Sudaker told me that the GOI has gone through various phases of opposing the 
services round to saying only agriculture to now who knows what. He agrees 
with the strategy of our US WTO Energy Services Coalition to work with 
companies and associations in asking them to contact their government to ask 
that energy services be on their list of agenda items. It would seem to me 
that India has such an interest. Sudaker and I agree that you are a key 
person to advise us and possibly to suggest to CII or others that they make 
such a pitch to the GOI Minister of Commerce.

I will ask Lora to send you the packet of materials Chris Long and I 
distributed in Brussels and London last week. I gave these materials to 
Sudaker today.

Everyone tells us that we need some developing countries with an interest in 
this issue. They may not know what we are doing and that they are likely to 
have an opportunity if energy services are ultimately negotiated.

Please review and advise us how we should proceed. We do need to get 
something done in October.
Joe

PS Terry Thorn is moderating a panel on energy services at the upcoming World 
Services Congress in Atlanta. The Congress will cover many services issues. I 
have noted in their materials that Mr. Alliwalia is among the speakers but 
not on energy services. They expect people from all over the world to 
participate.

		 Subject: ABX1 70 Further Nail in Generator's Coffin -- Absurdity in CA

I just heard about this bill by La Seur

ABX1 70 attempts to criminalize acts of unregulated generators if they 
perform maintenance at times other than the California Public Utilities 
Commission requires. Further, the commission is required to allow scheduled 
maintenance of only one generator at a time. 
So, with 500 generators in the state, just how  many years would it take to 
complete one round of maintenance?  Also, please note it does not apply to 
munis.

		 Subject: Story on American Companies in Europe

Dear Mr. Kean,

   Hello, I am Christian Schmollinger, a reporter with Natural Gas
Week. I'm not sure if you remember but we met at the press briefing that Mr.
Skilling held at the National Press Building at the end of the summer here
in Washington to discuss the California electricity markets.
   I am contacting you today in the hopes that I might be able to speak
with you or someone else from Enron for a story I am working on for this
week's issue concerning American natural gas marketers moving into Europe. I
was hoping I could interview someone with the company before Thursday so
that I could write the story before my Friday deadline.
   For the story, I am basically looking to do background, i.e. How is
the European market different from the American market? Will the network
business model translate well there? What kind of regulatory pitfalls do the
companies' face? Will a liquid natural gas market develop in Europe? If so,
what kind of timeline are we talking about? What is Enron's position and
take on the whole European market?
   I would appreciate any time or guidance you might be able to give me
on this subject. If you have any questions or comments please don't hesitate
to call. Once again, thanks for your time.

Sincerely,
Christian Schmollinger

You are invited to a meeting next Thursday (3/22) afternoon at 2:00 to 
discuss energy commodity and renewable energy credits for the Enron Building, 
Center and Stadium.  There are a few efforts that are going on simultaneously 
and I thought it would be a good idea for all of us to meet and get on the 
same page.  As many of you might know, Enron Wind (Michael Payne) and ENA 
(Mike Curry) have a great proposal to retire renewable energy credits from 
our Enron Wind facility to match the consumption of the building and stadium 
(details attached below).  If this proposal goes forward, Enron would be the 
1st Fortune 500 company to "go green" in its headquarters building.  Couple 
this w/ our energy star award, and we have GREAT environmental messaging.   
We'd like to highlight this announcement on Earth Day (April 22nd).

The facilities folks are interested in switching from Reliant to EES for 
actual commodity.  It makes sense to work strategically together on win-win 
proposal that will not only make sense economically, but that we can use in 
our messaging.  The focus of the meeting is to discuss the various proposals, 
and steps for moving forward.   

The meeting will be in EB50MO3 from 2:00-3:00. Please let me know if you or 
someone from your group can attend.

and has done much work on these sortrs of issues.  You comfortable with that?

Steve -

As you may know, Murray Weidenbaum, former Chair of the Council of Economic 
Advisors, and Professor of Economics at Washington University in St. Louis 
will be the Ken Lay Vinson &Elkins Visiting Scholar at the Jones School for 
the period January to May 2001. As he is on sabbatical from Washington 
University, he will have no teaching requirements of us but has offered to 
give some talks around and about for us.

Since Ken Lay once worked for Murray when Murray was Assistant Secretary of 
the Treasury, I wondered if Enron might be interested in jointly sponsoring 
a breakfast or luncheon talk by Murray sometime after the first of the 
year. He is giving a major address to the Detroit Economic Club in Janurary 
and I suspect that he will have the basis for a great talk in Houston as well.

In any event because of the title he will hold and because of our many 
joint ventures, I wanted to begin the process of finding a partner in this 
endeavor.

Let me know what you think.

Subject: California Power Issues Database

We have developed an intranet site/database for information tracking purposes 
for the California Power Issue. The intranet site will be placed on the 
home.enron.com webpage by Tuesday morning for all Enron employees to access. 
However, today, this comprehensive database is available to you for your 
California Power Issue needs. 

The database has been populated with the latest information that I have 
received concerning this topic and has been broken down in three categories:
California Power Issues, National Power Issues and Secured Documents. It has 
then been broken down further into subcategories.

The secured documents sections will only be accessible to those that are 
receiving this e-mail. Please let me know if you believe others should have 
access to this information. The secured document section contains all the 
information that I have received that Luntz Consulting has helped us develop, 
i.e. principals, statements, speeches and facts, as well as, talking points 
and other statements developed internally. These documents can be easily 
switched to open access to all Enron employees if you believe that these 
documents should not be restricted.

To access the intranet site you must be logged on to the network and then go 
to this link:  http://nahou-lndev02d.corp.enron.com/GovtAffa.nsf  (It is best 
if you copy this link and paste it in your internet Explorer or Netscape 
browser.)

Once you are at this site you will  be able to access all articles and 
information that I have collected/received concerning the California Power 
Issue. You can navigate the site by using the links on the left hand side of 
the screen. While navigating this site, keep in mind that the actual 
interface will be changed before we go live on Tuesday morning. 

To access the secured documents, click on secured documents and type in your 
user name, which is the same as if you are logging onto the network, and then 
type in your password, which is the same as if you are logging onto the 
network. However, if you have difficulties entering this site, you will need 
to change your Lotus internet password. Which is very simple to do and which 
you will need to do regardless if you decide to use this site or not, it is 
all part of the current computer migration. To change your internet password, 
go to this link  and then hit the edit person key. Go to the last field that 
says internet password and type in whatever password you would like, 
preferably your current network login password. (In the internet password 
section you will see a bunch of numbers and letters, delete those and enter 
your new network password.) 

There are still some bugs that will be worked out by Tuesday, but I thought 
since this is such a fast moving issue it was best to get this tool out so it 
could be used when needed. If you have any questions, please call me at 
713-853-4382.

Thanks,

Gavin

See below.  this is one of the issues that concerned us more than price caps, 
because it could limit our ability to move power to other markets in the west.

In addition, if you get questions from the analysts on "reregulation" or 
price caps it is worth pointing out that the high prices prevailing in many 
markets help our retail sales pitch to end use customers and create 
opportunities for our wholesale price risk management services . . .  even a 
$250 price cap is 5-10 times what large customers are accustomed to paying.

Dan Douglass summarized this.  This really puts CA and the ISO on notice that 
they cannot confiscate the power as they seem ready to do -- FERC reiterates 
that the generators can sell power wherever they want because the cap is a 
cap on ISO purchases.  ANd if the ISO want to set a sale price cap it has to 
file with FERC, wait 60 days and amend its contract

Subject: FERC Order on Morgan Stanley Complaint Against ISO


We have good news on the ISO price caps front.  The FERC has made it
clear that ISO does not have the ability to mandate that generators sell to 
ISO at its price caps and that the proper response to inadequate supply is to 
lift the price caps.

On Friday, the FERC issued its Order on Complaint in connection with the July 
10 complaint filed by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. ("MS").  As you may 
recall, MS requested FERC to issue a stay of the ISO's maximum purchase price 
authority and to direct the ISO to reverse any price cap reductions.  MS 
sought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule 206(h), which was granted by 
FERC on the grounds that the complaint "warrants expeditious action."

As a quick background summary for you, last November, FERC issued an order 
approving Tariff Amendment 21 which extended ISO's price cap authority 
through 11/15/00.  That order stated that the ISO "maximum purchase price was 
not a cap on what the seller may charge the ISO, but a cap on what the ISO 
was willing to pay."  The Commission said that sellers dissatisfied with the 
price cap could "choose to sell those services into the California Power 
Exchange or bilateral markets."

FERC notes in Friday's Order that the 6/28 the ISO's Board resolution lowered 
the caps to $500 and ISO further directed that, "To the extent permitted by 
law, regulation and pre-existing contract, Management shall direct generators 
to bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds 38,000 MW."

The MS complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would, 
"threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace."  MS also requested 
an emergency technical conference to examine ISO's justification for the 
price cap reduction.

FERC denied the MS stay request, as well as its request that the $750 maximum 
purchase price be reinstated.  The Commission reiterates that it is not 
approving a cap on sellers' prices, because they can sell at whatever price 
they want.  Rather ISO has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to 
pay.  "Because sellers are not required to sell to the ISO, the ISO cannot 
dictate their price."

Importantly, however, FERC also states that, "ISO has no more or less ability 
to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services....if 
the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced 
purchase price ceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they 
choose), it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to 
meet its needs."  [Emphasis added]  FERC then notes that this may lead to an 
increase in Out of Market ("OOM") calls and that OOM calls are not subject to 
a maximum purchase price.

Also, with regard to the ISO's resolution stating that generators must bid 
their capacity into the ISO markets when system load exceeds 38,000 MW, FERC 
states clearly that, "such a requirement is not permitted by our November  12 
Order and the ISO tariff."  [Emphasis added]

FERC goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ISO in conjunction with a 
maximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ISO's market 
rules, which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to 
ISO's tariff.  This would require 60 days' advance notice, "and could not be 
implemented prior to Commission approval.  As stated above, our November 12 
Order was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate 
supply (due to a low maximum purchase price) is to raise the maximum purchase 
price."

ISO is then "put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be 
accompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper 
response to low supplies in the ISO markets."

Concurrences were filed by Commissioners Massey and Hebert.  Massey suggests 
that the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues, such as risk 
management tools, removing constraints on hedging opportunities, introducing 
real time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new 
generation and transmission projects in California.  Hebert says that the 
previous November Order tried to "straddle the fence" and that, "Today, the 
Commission at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction of 
recognizing that we have a role."  He then reiterates his preference for 
removing all price caps.  He also suggests that, "Getting to the bottom of 
the problem, in my view, requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our 
approval of the ISO as operator of the California grid.  The record supports 
such a move."  He refers approvingly to the Collins resignation letter, 
stating that it, "thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of a 
return to 'command and control.' "  Hebert states that, "The independence of 
the ISO's governing structure stands threatened.  We should 'stand up,' to 
quote the resignation letter."  Hebert advocates opening a section 206 
proceeding now, as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk power 
markets, "including the California markets."

This decision makes it clear that ISO cannot lower the caps at tomorrow's 
meeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at that 
price.  This is an important development and very good news in our ongoing 
efforts to seek economic sanity at the ISO.

Please call if you have any questions.

Dan

As you have probably observed, power markets have been severely tested this 
summer.  There are many underlying causes (demand growth driven by a strong 
economy, failure of regulators to quickly grant applications for new 
generation, inadequate access to the grid, rate regulation which continues to 
insulate end users from real time price signals, etc.).  But, the soundbite 
on these troubles has been that deregulation has led to problems on the 
grid.  The knee jerk policy response has been price caps and other threats of 
re-regulation.

At the upcoming advisory council meeting, Ken and I were hoping that the two 
of you could discuss the issue and help put it in perspective:

How great of a threat is re-regulation.
How might we respond.
How likely is this issue to play a significant role in election politics?

Nice work Kerry and Barb.  I think we should do the follow up work on setting 
a follow up meeting with the Senator.  Ken left it open whether he would be

Ken talked to Sen Kinder.  He made the points you had prepared.  Kinder 
agreed to shelve the legislation for this session.  He said he had been 
hearing from several others, including Proctor and Gamble (which has a big 
facility in his district) that the legislation was not going to help 
competition develop in the state.  He expressed willingness to work with us 
on a better package and also expressed interest in coming to Enron's

I would be interested in this summer:
1)Political
2)International

These are two areas which I have pursued in the past and might like to 
continue with in the future.  Thanks for all your help.

Sandi deserves time off and she shouldn't have an obligation to do e-mail 
while she is out.  Further,  I was only copying her on messages that many 
others received (so I don't need to hear back from her).  But, if this is a 
standard message going out to everyone while the fires continue to rage in 
California, I think it leaves a bad impression.  Can we find a way to direct 
urgent requests to someone else in the office or to someone on our external 
lobby team?

Thanks so much for your message.  Your communications are always complete, 
firm, clear and polite.  I am sorry that perhaps the most critical aspect of 
your efforts -- security-- has been so confused by our end.  I understand 
from John Brindle that the confusion generated by our end has not kept you 
from accomplishing a great deal of the work anyway.  I have asked John to 
lead the effort, to the extent you need him.  John and his team are very 
experienced and have been in contact with and coordination with the London 
office.  Mike Hicks is a good hand, but for the most part, all I have asked 
him to do is be in a position to identify outside resources skilled in the 
area in question.  It is a bit too much to ask Mike to be hands on for all of 
Enron's corporate security needs.  A little background I'll bore you with:  
after Andre Legallo (formerly VP of Security for Enron) left, we did not 
replace his function.  Most of the operating companies had their own security 
and business controls groups.  When Andre left, we reduced the corporate 
function to a "default provider" role -- if a business unit had a need it was 
not otherwise meeting, Mike Hicks (as well as an outside consulting firm) 
would help identify competent resources in the area.  With the reorganization 
of EBS, I have inherited the very competent and experienced team they had 
assembled (led by John Brindle).  John identified some concerns regarding 
India mid last week.  I urged him to get in touch with Rebecca; he did.  It 
was clear after further inquiries by John that the India team had already 
addressed many if not all of the concerns and much of the remaining work 
involved implementation.  John volunteered to send some people over to help 
and I said OK.  He had already been in touch with the London team and Mike 
Hicks (who I have asked to return to Houston).

The last thing you need right now is confusion caused by a group saying 
"we're from corporate and we're here to help".  If you don't need any "help" 
or if the situation gets anything other than significantly better, let me 
know.

Subject: India Help

Steve,

As you are well aware, we are facing a lot of things happening fast in India. 
We are using several parts of your team, and are very pleased with most. I 
want to mention a couple of areas, HR and Security.

1. HR: I heard that some folks in Houston had raised concerns about the 
quality of the India HR team and their preparedness. The HR team is doing an 
outstanding job and I wanted you to hear that from me. Once we realized we 
had a major issue on our hand, and I received clearance from Rebecca and Jim 
to bring some HR folks into the loop, HR had someone on a plane within 20 
hours of my first call. We have always had great HR support through Drew 
Lynch and Bob Sparger, helping our team led by Sandip Malik, and this time 
Scott Gilchrist has joined in and helped as well. But the two workhorses have 
been Bob and Sandip. Bob got on a plane immediately and came over, and he and 
Sandip have been working around the clock so that we are much better prepared 
now than we were just a couple of days back. We really relied heavily on HR, 
and Drew had his team there for us.

2. PR: top notch team of John Ambler and Johan Zaayman, working with and 
supporting Jimmy Mogal on the ground. Johan and Jimmy have been a strong team 
on the ground, and John has provided leadership and all coordination with 
Houston. Great efforts and productive work.

3. Security: This area has not worked as well, and if you ever want feedback 
on our one-time experience with this group, I will provide it. I don't have 
any idea who is in charge from Enron's perspective here. There are 2 groups 
headed this way. Mike Hicks will arrive Thursday night, and Mike has informed 
us that he will be leading all security efforts. Jim Rountree is apparently 
travelling with Mike, and Don Hawkins sent me an e-mail earlier today telling 
me that Don has instructed Jim that Jim is in charge of coordinating our 
security. John Brindle has sent me an e-mail saying that you have asked him 
to coordinate and help in the ongoing efforts, and John is sending 3 people 
over arriving Saturday night. First, we are very happy to have the help, but 
I just hope that Mike, Jim and John know which of the three are in charge. If 
you could just let me know who you want to be in charge, we will coordinate 
with that person.

On a side note, the people who have really been helpful were brought in 
through Drew Lynch of Europe HR. They are Jim Roth and Dave Lawler, both of 
whom work for John Sherriff. They had a great attitude, were willing to work 
day and night and were planning on coming to coordinate until Mike decided he 
would come.

At Mike's earlier suggestion, we engaged Hill & Associates to help on 
security. Because I was having to meet with them 3 to 4 times per day, I 
asked Jane Wilson to help coordinate all our security efforts. Jane has done 
a fantastic job in an impossibly short time frame. The tasks she has been 
overseeing include coordinating with Hill & Associates, removing (in a lowkey 
yet rush manner) over 400 boxes of files and documents and getting them 
through customs and to Europe, removing 2 container truck loads of files from 
the Dabhol site and getting them out of the country, and overseeing a 
complete security check and file removal of all our electronic files from 
servers, desktops and laptops. In addition, she has coordinated security for 
all expats and families as well as worked with EOGIL expats and Anthony 
Duenner of EBS Asia.

Again, we appreciate all the help. 

Wade

    Let me review where we stand for the April 10-11 meeting.
1.  I have spoken with Gavyn and asked him to add to his usual review 
comments on the significance of recent developments for Enron.
2.  I have asked Bill Kristol to do the same.
3.  I have asked Paul Portney to review "the lay of the land" in the 
environmental policy area.
4.  Since we couldn't locate a speaker to address the question of how Enron, 
now larger and more corporate than in the past, can continue to attract the 
best, the brightest (and the oddest?), I have asked Pankaj to give a brief 
talk about what the literature generated by his colleagues has to tell us on 
this subject.
5.  I couldn't get anyone on the "monopoly-too-big-and-powerful" question, 
although I am still trying.
I assume you folks will brief us on California and the national energy supply 
picture. Have we heard from the author of "When Genius Fails"?

I think paul has a number of good suggestions here.  I think that tying 
rankings to clear objectives does not reflect the fluidity of our charge, 
though, and will lead to expectations which may not be met.  I also feel 
strongly that the ranking needs to be a relative one -- I would go to a pure 
number system.  We are going to need to assess at each PRC whether the 
organization is strong (in which case I think it's ok to have a 
disproportionate number of high ratings) or whether the organization has 
weaknesses that force us to grade tougher.  You don't get that in an absolute 
system with preset expectations.  I think your group in particular has done a 
good job of emphasizing team work ( and punishing those who don't play well) 
so we need not create a competitive or jockeying environment so long as that 
emphasis is communicated explicitly.

I agree with Paul's points about giving clear, specific feed back (though I 
don't think we can give a clear target for what one must accomplish to be 
superior).  I also like the idea of the abbreviated mid year PRC to deal with 
those we need to counsel more vigorously.  I'm not sure we can get away with 
it but I am willing to give it a shot.

I think Paul is to be complimented for taking time to focus on the larger 
organizational issues .... very vice presidential of him... no overstepping 
of bounds ... quite the contrary.

Here's my effort to respond to the PRC discussion we had in Kohler.  

The criteria for evaluating folks is at the end of the presentation ... but I 
took the liberty to go a bit further and comprehensively address the PRC 
process.    Hope I didn't overstep my bounds ....

I'm around today, as well as Monday (ENA meeting most of the day) and 
Tuesday, but then traveling in Reno, Las Vegas and San Francisco for the 
remainder of the week.   I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss the reasoning 
and rationale behind the document.  

As I said on my voice mail, I circulated the document to the attendees at 
Kohler (with the exception of Sue L. and Linda R.).  I've had feedback from a 
number of the attendees, but I can't call it a consensus document.

As always, thanks for the opportunity to make suggestions like this.

Dear?Jeff,
?
Greetings from Austin.? On behalf of Governor Bush, it  is my pleasure to 
invite you to join?the Governor's  IT National Steering Committee.??You have  
been?recognized as a technology?leader whose experience and insight  would?be 
a valuable addition to the group.? The three  requirements for joining are:
1)?Public support of Governor  Bush.
2)?Willingness to comment on  policy issues.
3)?Help in finding other  technology leaders to join the group.
The group was formed last fall and is composed primarily of technology  
leaders (Michael Dell, John Chambers, Floyd Kvamme, Gordon Moore, Jim  
Barksdale,?Scott McNealy,  plus many others).??NSC members are Republicans, 
Democrats, and  Independents who support Governor  Bush.??
?
In July, the group met here in Austin  to discuss burning issues in the 
technology community and to share them with  Governor Bush in a private 
meeting(the AP  wire story describing the event is at bottom).??To  give you 
a better idea of the nature and composition of the group, I have  attached a 
pdf file?of  an?April ad?that ranin USA Today?that  includes?a declaration of 
support by NSC members for Governor  Bush.
?
If you are interested in joining the NSC, please provide the  following:
Full Name (and preferred name) - e.g., Timothy R. Smith (Tim)
Preferred Email
Company
Title
Mailing Address
Phone/Fax
Name of Assistant (if  relevant)
Acceptance  of?the three membership requirements listed  above
Please do not hesitate to contact me with  any questions.? As we come  closer 
to the election, we are focusing primarily?on recruiting new members  to join 
the NSC and?keeping members abreast and plugged into campaign  events and 
policy matters, especially those that relate to New Economy and  technology 
issues.
?
Best regards,
?
Price Roe
on behalf of Dr. Bill Rice
?
P.S.? I recently graduated  from?HBS and think it would be great to?get 
another highly  accomplished HBS?alum like you on board in support of the  
Governor.

Bush meeting with high-tech council  


JIM VERTUNO, Wednesday  July 19, 8:53 am

Associated Press Writer AUSTIN, Texas (AP)???Gov. George W. Bush wants to 
compare  notes on issues ranging from Internet privacy, to cyber crime to 
closing the  so-called ``digital divide'' that sometimes leaves minority 
households behind in  the computer age during a planned Wednesday meeting 
with technology leaders.  About 130 members of the Bush campaign's 350-member 
high-tech council, including  Dell Computer Corp. chairman Michael Dell, were 
scheduled to meet behind closed  doors at Austin's Jewish Community Center.?. 
. 

``I am excited  about all of the opportunities that technology has given us 
to make a profound  and positive impact on the world,'' said Bush, the 
presumptive Republican  presidential nominee. ``America is a pioneer in the 
high-tech industry and it is  vital for us to maintain this status,'' Bush 
said. '' Leading the world in  innovation will not only improve the lives of 
Americans, but will also create  many quality jobs.'' 

The purpose of the meeting was to allow the group to  present Bush with their 
thoughts and share up-to-the minute information on the  issues, said Bush 
campaign spokesman Tucker Eskew. The campaign also was to  unveil its 
revamped Web site. One of its features will allow users to download  
event-specific posters or placards for campaign events.

Steve,

Alberto Usobiaga who initially headed Azurix in Mexico is now working for 
Aguas de Barcelona (major share holders: Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux, the Spanish 
Energy Conglomerate ENDESA and the Caixa-Barcelona Pension Funds).

He tells me that he contacted Rebecca Mark and  John Garrison and offered 
them to buy all of Azurix Mexico's business (Cancun, IASA in Mexico City and 
the Leon and Torreon concessions).  There was no clear response.

If the Argentinian Government approves they might be iunterested at taking a 
look at Azurix in Argentina.  They cannot buy Wessex because of regulatory 
issues.  

They are certainly ready for Mexico. 

How should I proceed?

Please advise.

Ricardo

California Hearings Continue, 
CPUC Decision Expected This Week 



by Will McNamara 
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

 

Hearings aimed at giving consumer advocates and utility officials in 
California the chance to air their views on a looming electricity rate 
increase are expected to continue through today, setting the stage for a 
decision by regulators that very well may not please everyone. Officials from 
Southern California Edison (SCE) and Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) have asked 
the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to grant immediate rate 
hikes of as much as 30 percent to help offset rising wholesale power prices. 
The CPUC board is expected to announce on Jan. 4 how much of a rate hike it 
will allow, and under what terms. 

Analysis: Despite the lull of the holiday week just now completed, the 
spotlight continues to grow more intense over California's energy market, 
both throughout the energy industry and across the mainstream media. As we 
wait with anticipation to hear what the CPUC will decide, let's recap some of 
the issues that will no doubt continue to cause great dissension among the 
primary players in California. 

As has been well documented, PGOand SCE are in a massive amount of debt due 
to uncollected costs they have accrued related to the purchase of power on 
the wholesale market. Due to rate freezes still in place, both utilities have 
been unable to charge customers for the dramatic increase in the price of 
wholesale power, which has placed them both on the brink of bankruptcy. 

>From several conversations with my contacts in California, here's my 
understanding of where the negotiations currently stand. The CPUC already has 
agreed in theory to a rate increase, but the sticking point is the specific 
amount of that increase. Reportedly, the CPUC and Gov. Gray Davis proposed a 
15-percent rate hike to the two utilities. In sharp contrast, PGOmaintains 
that it needs to increase rates by as much as 40 percent, and SCE says that 
it wants an increase of 30 percent (or 76 percent over two years). In fact, 
PGOalready began notifying customers last week that it wants to boost their 
electric bills by that specific amount. Both utilities continue to argue that 
even if their proposed rate increases are accepted, they still may not be 
enough to cover wholesale costs, which are projected to rise through 2003 
(see my IssueAlert from Dec. 29). In addition, PGOand SCE also claim that 
their financial solvency still will not be guaranteed even if their rate 
increase proposals are accepted, and bankruptcy will be very likely if the 
CPUC only allows them to increase rates by 15 percent.  

Over the last few weeks, pressure was put on the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (FERC) to step in and solve the problem. However, FERC issued its 
own order in early December that mainly focused on mechanisms to keep power 
generators active in the state and did not adequately address the core issues 
of high wholesale prices and rate freezes. Due to the lukewarm response that 
FERC's order received, it has been generally concluded that the CPUC and Gov. 
Davis alone will have to solve the California energy crisis.  

It is important to not overlook or discount the role that consumer advocates 
are playing in the negotiations. Harvey Rosenfield, a long-time critic of the 
state's utilities who led the failed attempt to overturn deregulation in 
California in 1998, remains very vocal that "the people of California should 
not have to pay one more penny to bail out the utilities for the mistakes 
they made." Consumer groups led by Rosenfield and Ralph Nader continue to put 
enormous pressure on Gov. Davis, a Democrat, to keep any rate increase given 
to the utilities to a minimum. In fact, last week Nader stated that Davis' 
political future "hangs by a kilowatt hour" and that any decisions made in 
California will "reverberate all over the country." In essence, consumer 
groups believe that utilities share the bulk of responsibility for the 
current mess in the state, as they played a large role in California's 1996 
restructuring legislation. If mistakes were made in that legislation, 
consumer groups say, the utilities and not utility customers should be made 
to pay the price.  

Speculation is growing that, on Jan. 4, the CPUC will approve an increase for 
extra costs that will be applied in increments over the course of 2001, 
resulting in an ultimate rate increase that is somewhere in the range of 15 
percent to 30 percent (or more). This in effect will offer a compromise to 
both sides. The utilities will receive a rate increase closer to what they 
claim is necessary, and utility customers will not get slapped with an 
immediate, all-at-once increase in their electricity bills. However, the CPUC 
probably will not approve any back billing that the utilities have also 
demanded. Both PGOand SCE have claimed that their stranded costs were 
probably paid off months ago, meaning that the rate freeze still in place for 
both utilities should have been lifted as a result. That theory being 
accurate, both companies want to bill their customers retroactively to the 
date that the rate freeze should have been lifted, which on its own could 
amount to several billions of dollars. Under the current arrangement, the 
rate freeze is scheduled to stay in effect until March 2002, unless lifted by 
the CPUC. 

Meanwhile, the question about the financial solvency of both PGOand SCE 
continues to loom. SCE's parent, Edison International, announced that it has 
eliminated its fourth-quarter dividend and reduced its work force by 400 jobs 
because of financial problems related to SCE. In a statement last week, 
PGOCEO Gordon Smith acknowledged that PGOhas "virtually exhausted its 
financial resources" because it has borrowed on average $1 million per hour 
to pay for power that it is obligated to provide to California consumers.  

Both utilities have argued that the real cause of the problem in the state is 
the generators who unjustifiably continue to charge exorbitant rates for 
power on the wholesale market. There may be some validity to this theory as 
power generators who operate in California know that the state's IOUs have 
essentially been stripped of their own ability to generate power and thus are 
heavily dependent on power bought on the wholesale market. This has given an 
enormous amount of market power to the generators and allowed them to charge 
rates that are not reflective of their own costs. Some reports indicate that 
generators are charging as much as 30 times what it costs them to generate 
power. Yet, without a cap on wholesale rates, generators remain able to 
charge whatever price the market will bear.  

Due to these high costs, some power generators have begun refusing to sell 
power to the California IOUs, out of fear that the utilities will not be able 
to pay their bills. In an ironic twist, the same companies that have 
expressed concern about selling power to PGOand SCE actually own and control 
the plants that were divested by the two utilities as part of their 
agreements in the state's restructuring plan. Thus, companies outside of (and 
inside) California that own California plants are refusing to sell power back 
into the state, power produced at plants that were once owned by PGOand SCE. 

As a result, PGOwent on record last week saying that it may not have enough 
power to serve customers in February unless additional rulings come from the 
CPUC. PGOsays that it has enough power to supply customers through January, 
but that 15 to 20 suppliers have demanded payment up front before selling 
natural gas to the utility in February. Due to its current debt situation, 
PGOclaims that it cannot make any payments up front and thus may not be able 
to buy natural gas to serve its customers.  

These issues have formed the landscape across which negotiations still rage 
on in California. Much pressure is now being placed on the CPUC to formulate 
an end-all solution to the state's problems, one that can appease all the 
dissenting stakeholders. Yet, much like FERC's order which was criticized for 
not going far enough, the CPUC is particularly challenged to make decisions 
that can once and for all solve the state's structural problems. As Enron's 
Kenneth Lay said a few months ago, the CPUC must avoid "putting band-aids on 
California's hemorrhaging wounds" and instead complete a successful 
reconstructive surgery.

I doubt that this is worth the trouble (i.e. running it through a conflict of 
interest check, ensuring no liability for actions taken on the advice, etc).

       Power sector restructuring: international activity, June - November
       2000


      This  mailing is a periodic update of the status of international
      electric power sector privatization and restructuring.


      Privatizations and restructuring activity continue apace.
      Governments faced with burgeoning power demands, but lacking the
      funds to meet them, are nearly universally opening their generation
      markets to foreign investors, even where privatization is not on the
      agenda.  More and more, state-owned utilities are unbundling.
      Competition is being introduced into national markets at both the
      wholesale and retail levels.  A few international players have scaled
      back their international investments and shifted substantial portions
      of their portfolio to less risky markets, such as the U.S. or Europe.
      Competition in Europe has been spurred by the EU Directive.  As Asian
      economies recover, most governments are starting to move forward
      again with unbundling / restructuring plans.  After a year in which
      currency devaluations caused a number of early investors to exit
      Latin America, a healthier economy has allowed privatizations to
      restart, but at a slower pace.


      This mailing summarizes recent developments in Europe, Asia-Pacific,
      Latin America, and the Middle East / Africa. Maps that summarize the
      status of restructuring in Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa
      and the Middle East are attached as Exhibits 1-4.  A slippery slope
      is Exhibit 5.  Timelines showing the opening of markets in various
      countries, by region, are in Exhibits 6-8.


      (See attached file: Intlmail 3 exhibits.ppt)













      February '99 marked the opening of the market to choice for most
      large EU customers who use over 40 GWh a year.  This accounts for
      about a fourth of demand.  As of "E-Day", neither France nor Italy
      had passed their proposed enabling legislation.  While the EU
      intended for the transmission operator to be independent, EDF intends
      to retain control over the grid, as will ENEL.  A phased deregulation
      of the gas industry began to unfold in similar fashion beginning in
      August 2000.


      Mergers, alliances, and consolidation are a dominant theme as
      companies jockey for position in the new European power market.
      There is a tremendous opportunity for international players to cross
      borders: as suppliers of new generation, as purchasers of assets
      being spun off by liberalization decrees (Italy) or because of market
      concentration rulings in mergers (Germany, Spain). Several
      international companies have opened trading offices in Europe, or  (
      Enron, Reliant, Southern, TXU).  HoustonStreet.com launched a
      European online wholesale energy-trading platform.


           ?  Austria:  Austria's liberalizing market is facing problems
              from within and without.  The EU is dissatisfied with its
              lack of G-T-D unbundling, although accounts were formally
              separated in 1999.  There is no ISO.  Internally, there is
              intense discussion about an accelerated market opening
              (customers over 20 GWh now have choice). Regional utilities
              are angry over the Verbund's proposal to open 100% of the
              market in late 2001. The Verbund, a 51% SOU, is the largest
              generator and owns the transmission grid. However, it has no
              retail customers and hence is strongly exposed to already
              deregulated wholesale customers. (C.B. White, Judith Lezaun)

           ?  Denmark: The 1999 liberalization law exceeds the EU
              directive's goals and establishes full retail access by 2003.
              Choice was phased in for large industrials using more than
              100 GWh in 1997;  the threshold dropped in April '00 more
              than 10 GWh; the next threshold drops to 1GWh at the end of
              2000. The new law includes unbundling of distribution
              activity and regulated TPA. Denmark has recently experienced
              a consolidation wave in generation that leaves the sector
              with 2 large incumbents. The trend is moving downstream into
              distribution and supply. Western Denmark is already part of
              the Nordic power exchange NordPool and East Denmark is due to
              join by the end of 2000. Energy policy aims at twenty percent
              of electricity sales would come from renewables by the end of
              2003, up from a current 10%. (Cecilia Bergman)

           ?  Finland: Finland has been fully open to choice since
              September 1998, when a metering requirement was dropped.
              Prices immediately dropped, but only about 2-3% of households
              have switched supplier. Finland forms part of the Nordic
              power exchange NordPool. The regulator monitors distribution
              tariffs and a rTPA regime is in place. In November '98, the
              Finnish government launched an IPO for 20% of Fortum, the
              holding company for the merger of utility Imatran Voima Oy
              and oil and gas company Neste Oy. The Finnish government
              expects to lower its ownership further. The largest new
              entrant in the market is Swedish Vattenfall, with its
              acquisitions of distributors and some generation capacity.
              Further M&A in the distribution and supply sector is
              expected. (Cecilia Bergman)

           ?  France: There was irony in France's push for liberalization
              as it assumed its six-month EU presidency.    France passed
              its electricity law last February, a year after required by
              EU directive, but had 30-odd implementation decrees stalled
              in the National Assembly.  However, EDF, which still controls
              more than 95% of French generation, realized Brussels would
              hinder its foreign ambitions if its domestic market remained
              closed. It recently convinced French authorities to open up
              34% of the market by the end of 2000 instead of 2003,
              lowering the eligibility threshold to 9 GWh/year (from 16
              GWh). EDF is also aware that its monopoly prevents it from
              easily entering the energy services market  -- leading EDF to
              promote a "relatively rapid" total opening of the French
              market. (Corinne Aigroz, White)

           ?   Germany:  While the Electricity Law was officially effective
              in April '98, real competition is still impeded by
              complicated TPA grid access conditions, especially on the
              retail market. A group of new entrants has organized to call
              for a governmental regulator.  Some recent studies have shown
              the cost of electricity so low on some bills as to indicate a
              "massive cross-subsidization between network operations and
              marketing." Recent charges have been made of obstacles to
              competition by a mulitiplicity of fees, including customer
              switching charges and supplier entrants registration levies.
              In the last 12 months, M&A among big national and
              international utilities has redrawn the German utility
              landscape: EDF bought a share in EnBW, Veba / Viag merged to
              form EON and RWE/VEW merged into RWE. Furthermore, RWE and
              EON must sell their stakes in VEAG due to antitrust
              authority.  Currently, several utilities are and battling for
              control of East German VEAG, whose transmission connections
              make it a portal to Eastern Europe.  (Judith Lezaun, White)

           ?  Greece: According to the FT, Greece has "hired a consultant"
              (us) to produce a 5-year plan for state utility PPC.  PPC is
              preparing an IPO for 15-20% of the company, theoretically set
              for 2001, but likely later.  Greece has been given until 2001
              by the EU to conform to the Directive. An IEA report
              suggested two major swift changes to the energy sector
              structure.  First, the government should create a clearer
              separation between itself and the state-owned PPC, including
              a separate regulatory agency.  Second, the government should
              consider splitting the PPC into competing generators to
              maximize competition, as well as improving market access
              conditions for IPPs and cogenerators.  As the country's
              largest employer, PPC is not likely to effect these changes
              quickly. (White, Thomas Read)

           ?  Ireland: Supply competition was introduced in February '00
              for customers over 4 GWh (28% of the market).  Opening is
              scheduled to increase to 32% in 2003, with further
              liberalisation in 2006.  No date for mid-market and full
              retail opening has been set.   Incumbent ESB plans to split
              off its transmission business, which will remain state-owned.
              Competition in generation will be introduced in 2002 with the
              auctioning of ESB capacity, which is intended to create at
              least two new players.  Independent power production has been
              allowed for two years now. (Ben Joyce)

           ?  Italy:  Italy approved its market deregulation decree in
              March '99; in some measures, it goes beyond the EU Directive.
              ENEL had dominated 80% of generation; by 2003, no entity can
              control more than 50%, or 30% by 2005.  This requires that
              ENEL sell between 15GW and 22GW of its 57GW by 2003.  It has
              separated G-T-D into separate legal entities and been 34.5%
              privatized.  A second tranche should take place in 2001.  A
              pool mechanism should be operating by 2001.  Consortia of
              industrials using more 30GWh/year can contract directly with
              IPPs; by 2002, the threshold will be 9GWh/ year. The
              potential free market currently amounts to 80 TWh a year, or
              30% of total demand.  This will increase to 40% in 2002.
              ENEL, who has a de facto monopoly on T&D, will retain
              ownership of the national grid assets; a separate state-run
              ISO, GRTN, will run transmission and dispatching.  A pool
              mechanism, operated by a GRTN subsidiary, should be operating
              by 2001; in the meantime, the market uses bilateral
              contracts. (Valentina Grifo, White)

           ?  Netherlands:  By June '00 three of the four large generation
              companies had been sold to foreign energy groups.
              Competition for large industrial users began in August '98.
              Large industrials (33% of the market) can currently choose
              their supplier.  By 2002, 58% of the market will be
              competitive, and in 2004, there will be full customer choice.
              The Amsterdam Power Exchange, modeled along Scandinavian
              lines, was launched in May '99.  The APX allows players to
              trade power over the Internet on an hourly basis for the next
              day.  In April '00, it added day-ahead prices at border
              points for Germany, although it is not yet much used; if
              successful, Belgium would follow. In October '00, the
              government agreed to buy the entire high voltage network,
              TenneT, from the four generation companies for $99.1 million.
              Their goal was to improve the supply market and to increase
              real competition. (White, Karel Tutein Nolthenius)

           ?  Norway:  Norway opened up to retail access in one fell swoop
              in 1991. "Real" retail access got started in 1995 when the
              meter requirement was abolished; switching got started in
              1997 when a switching fee was canceled.  The current
              accumulated switching rate lies at 14%. Distribution tariffs
              are regulated and transparent according to rTPA. Norway forms
              part of NordPool. (Cecilia Bergman)

           ?  Portugal: Portugal brought new regulations into force in
              January '99.  They include a price-cap system for determining
              tariffs and the creation of two coexisting supply systems:
              public and independent.  Each is locked into supplying the
              national grid (REN), a regulated and EdP-owned monopoly.
              Producers within the independent system can currently supply
              eligible customers who consume more than 9GWh/year at a
              single site.  The country's four discos may purchase up to 8%
              of consumption outside the public system.  Portugal's
              regulator, ERSE, needs either to extend the eligible
              customers or raise the allowed percent for discos in order to
              reach the percents required by the Directive.  The government
              sold another stake of 20% of state-owned Electricidade de
              Portugal in October '00, following two successful offerings
              in '97 and '98.   This offering raised $1.34 billion.  The
              state retains 32.6% and "golden share" voting rights. (Rui de
              Sousa)

           ?  Spain: After several major Latin American purchases, Endesa
              moved to restructure and consolidate at home, announcing in
              October '00 the merger with Iberdrola.  The resulting company
              would have 80% of the market, so it would be forced to shed
              generation and distribution assets.  It would also create the
              world's 4th largest utility, by market cap. There is also
              movement with the smaller two players.

              The Spanish regulator is applying an eligibility schedule
              faster than the minimum requirements of the EU Directive
              providing for full market opening by January 2003. Several
              foreign players are already authorized to supply eligible
              consumers and there are new generation capacity additions
              announced by some of the large international. Nearly 60% of
              the market can now choose its supplier.  A mandatory pool
              with a bidding system started in Jan '98. (White, Dominguez)

           ?   Sweden: Deregulation was introduced in January '96 with full
              retail access to all customer groups, rTPA and unbundling of
              distribution activities. However, switching was impeded by a
              meter requirement that was abolished in November '99.
              Switching is currently at 10% but with renegotiated contracts
              the figure is more like 25%. Sweden forms part of NordPool, a
              "common electricity market", a forum for physical and
              financial exchanges. Alongside NordPool is a bilateral market
              and an OTC market for financial trading. Consolidation has
              occurred in the distribution sector mainly and the generation
              market is concentrated in the hands of 3 large actors.
              (Cecilia Bergman)

           ?  Switzerland: In October '00, Parliament passed an electricity
              market law.  The first phase of the liberalization should
              start in 2001 granting choice to large industrials (> 20
              GWh); the mid-size market will open in 2004 (> 10 GWh). In
              2007, the law envisions a fully open market. Some aspects of
              the new law, such as the transmission tariff model, are still
              being discussed. (Chris Brombacher, White)

           ?  UK: With market deregulation complete (full choice since May
              1999), the UK market is now settling into a phase of supply
              consolidation.  Seven of the 12 RECs in England & Wales are
              now in joint ownership.  In the generation market, the
              incumbent's share continues to decline: National Power and
              PowerGen have divested further capacity, and now stand at
              8.5% and 6.7%.

              The New Electricity Trading Arrangements for wholesaling have
              been postponed to early 2001.  They will allow for a futures
              and forwards market to trade alongside the established spot
              market.  Markets will be run by independent members, although
              the balancing and settlement mechanism will be run by a
              system operator as before.  A bilateral power exchange will
              also be put in, and is expected to handle a much larger
              demand than the spot market. (Ben Joyce)







      In Central and Eastern Europe, privatization initiatives are
      continuing to attract badly needed capital, while the IMF urges
      reforms as a condition for funding.  Countries that are looking to EU
      membership have moved forward with power sector restructuring and
      gradual opening of their markets to choice.

           ?  Bulgaria: In January, the Energy Agency announced its intent
              to unbundle the state monopoly, NEK, into separate G-T-D
              companies.  NEK will remain a single buyer; 28 distribution
              entities have been merged into seven new companies.  The
              unions are opposing rapid reform, claiming the necessary
              regulations have not yet been written.  The government is
              working with the IMF to set up financial controls and
              eliminate cross-subsidies.  Between 2001 and 2005, all
              generation will be upgraded or privatized.  Transmission will
              remain state-owned.  (Csilla Ilkei, White)

           ?  The Czech Republic: In October '00, the Czech government
              announced it would sell a strategic stake in generator CEZ
              and in six of the eight regional distributors to a single
              buyer. Privatization is expected to begin in 2001.  Many
              Western companies, such as Vattenfall and E.On have already
              been quietly buying up stakes in small municipal distributors
              who need the cash to balance their budgets. A new energy law
              should be also approved by the end of 2000, which would open
              power markets to competition between 2002 and 2006; prices
              should reflect costs by 2002.  Gas liberalization will follow
              in 2005.  CEZ is testing its controversial nuclear plant,
              Temelin, which should begin operating by spring 2001. CEZ
              plans to cut wholesale electricity prices by 20% after the
              commercial launch of Temelin. (Kristina Kalinova, White)

           ?  Hungary: Since December '95, majority shares have been sold
              in the six regional discos and five gencos to Western
              investors.   Eastern Europe's  earliest and most ambitious
              privatization program has fallen victim to a host of
              problems, especially central government price control.  AES
              and IVO-Tomen tendered new capacity tendered in 1999, but AES
              is now bringing MVM to arbitration over its failure to sign
              its agreed-on PPA.   Hungary will partially deregulate its
              market after 2002 but before it joins the EU. Further
              privatization opportunities include a coal-fired power plant
              as well as the monopoly transco, MVM. (Cs. Ilkei, White)

           ?  Moldova: The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
              has expressed an interest in stakes in privatized assets of
              Modova, giving privatization scheduled for this year a boost.
              Majority shares will be sold in first in five distribution
              companies, then in three generators. The first attempt to
              privatize distribution failed to receive timely bids.  All
              companies will require substantial investment for upgrades.

           ?  Romania: In September '00, the national electric company,
              Conel, was split into four independent units. These encompass
              fossil generation, hydro generation, transmission, and
              distribution and metering. Restructuring precedes eventual
              privatization, which will begin with distribution, followed
              by generation.  Current law requires foreign owners to have a
              local partner.  As Romania is one of the countries invited to
              join accession talks with the EU, it is opening its market in
              stages.  Currently, 10% (>100GWh) has choice; this will rise
              to 45% (>40GWh) next year.  Evenually, elegibility thresholds
              will be lowered to 20GWh, then 9GWh. (Cs. Ilkei,White)

           ?  Russia: In the mid-1990s, the Unified Energy Systems of
              Russia Joint Stock Company (UES; also known as RAO), was
              organized into 72 regional joint stock companies; UES still
              holds 49% shares in most of these regional utilities.  In May
              '00, President Putin fired the non-reformist energy minister
              who had blocked earlier attempts at privatization and
              liberalization.  The new minister is an unknown quantity.
              The head of UES has wanted to privatize significant portions
              of UES and to lift foreign ownership controls, currently at
              25%. (White)

           ?  Slovak Republic: In October 2000 the government approved a
              plan to restructure and partially privatize its energy
              sector; implementation legislation needs to be passed.  The
              plan would see state-owned Slovenske Elektrarne (the G-T-D
              monopoly) transformed into a 100% state-owned joint stock
              company.   Regional distributors will be separated from SE
              and merged in the first half of 2001 into three joint-stock
              companies, with a 49% block of shares to be sold.  Generation
              will also be separated and transformed into joint stock
              companies. Municipalities will acquire majority stakes in the
              heating plants.  The government will select a privatization
              adviser for SE and for the distribution companies in early
              2001. (Kristina Kalinova)

           ?  Turkey: The controversy over BOO (build-own-operate) vs. BOT
              (build-operate-transfer) arrangements for IPPs was resolved
              in January 2000.  Turkey passed a retroactive constitutional
              amendment allowing international arbitration for energy
              contracts.  Twenty-three BOT projects are affected.  Turkish
              economic growth is fueling a need to triple its capacity to
              64 GW by 2010.  In September, Turkey proposed an energy law
              that would separate state-owned TEAS into separate G-T-D
              entities.  Generation plants would eventually be available
              for privatization, while new plants would no longer be
              transferred to the government, but remain with the IPP
              builder.  The impetus for this proposed law is Turkey's
              interest in EU membership; only 1/8th of its 120 energy
              regulations meets EU standards.  (White)

           ?  Ukraine:  Authorities have announced the sale of seven of the
              country's 27 regional discos, in a transparent tender.   Such
              a sale has been unsuccessfully tried before.  Each sale will
              be for 25% plus one share. The distribution sector is beset
              with a host of problems including high non-payment, unpaid
              employees, and corruption.  The EBRD is pushing for progress
              on privatization before it provides funds to build an
              alternative to Chernobyl, which the authorities have agreed
              to close.









      Asian economies are recovering from the economic crisis and in some
      countries electricity demand is returning to pre-crisis levels.  Most
      governments are starting to move forward again with unbundling /
      restructuring plans in the power sector; although IPPs are facing
      ongoing problems relating to PPAs and lack of government guarantees.


           ?  Australia:  All customers in Australia should have choice by
              2003.  Victoria will to phase in full competition during
              2001.  New South Wales (NSW) has delayed full competition for
              residential users and small businesses to January '02.  The
              five other states plan to phase in full choice by 2003.
              Victoria's five distributors are facing revenue reductions of
              between 12% and 22% starting in 2001, whey they say will hurt
              their service capability.  Recent M&A activity has seen
              already- privatized Victorian distribution, retail, and
              transmission change hands, with new owners coming from Asia.
              ElectraNet, South Australia's (SA) transco, was sold as a
              200-year lease in September.  The National Electricity
              Market, comprising Victoria and NSW, started operating in
              December '99.  Queensland, SA and ACT will join in the next
              few years.

           ?  China:  China is aiming for nationwide interconnection,
              including Hong Kong, by 2010. Power pooling and increased
              interconnection is being tested in Zhejiang and Shanghai
              provinces.  As there is no process or body in place to
              oversee reforms, some believe that sector reform is a mere
              slogan. Investors are backing off of a number of planned IPPs
              following a government decision to cap the ROR for new
              projects at 10%.  Another issue is lack of government
              guarantees.  China plans to build hundreds of small rural
              hydro projects and to spend Yn55bn to upgrade rural power
              grids in 2000 as part of a project to bring electricity to 75
              million people who currently have no access.

           ?  India:  Five of India's 19 states have undertaken significant
              reforms: Orissa, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and
              Uttar Pradesh.  And, only four of the State Electricity
              Boards (SEBs), the principal buyers for independent power,
              are profitable.  IPP builders have been frustrated by a host
              of regulations, lack of guarantees, and SEB insolvencies.
              The growing Indian power deficit was dramatically highlighted
              this year by the withdrawal of two major investors, EdF and
              Cogentrix.
              A draft "Electricity Bill 2000" will be introduced in
              Parliament this winter.  It would create and empower
              autonomous State Electricity Regulation Commissions.  SEBs
              would be unbundled into G-T-D and corporatized within four
              months of passage.  Initially, states would initially retain
              G&D assets; they would later be privatized.  Transmission
              assets would be put under an independent authority, and TPA
              would be allowed.  Significantly, IPP licensing requirements
              would be clarified and reduced, and largely eliminated for
              the growing segment of captive producers.  A key problem of
              theft ? as high as 30% of T&D losses in some areas ? would be
              addressed by strict metering and high penalties.  The
              likelihood, however, of the Bill being passed as proposed is
              not strong, as it faces significant opposition both by unions
              and regional parties in Parliament.

           ?  Indonesia:  Indonesia's IPP program has faced problems over
              power purchase costs and project rates of return, with
              bankrupt state-owned PLN claiming it is unable to pay IPP
              operators for power.  Of 27 planned IPP projects, only three
              now supply power; six others are ready to generate.  PLN
              reached an interim agreement with Paiton Energy under which
              Paiton will supply energy for 10 months, at a rate said to be
              much lower than the original agreed-upon price.  Other PPA
              renegotiations will likely force IPPs to operate at a loss
              until the Indonesian economy revives and PLN's financial
              situation improves.  Unbundling is underway on Java/Bali,
              where PLN has created two generation subsidiaries.  Outside
              Java/Bali, unbundling of PLN will be along geographic lines.
              The Indonesian government recently selected KEMA Consulting
              to develop rules for a competitive market.

           ?  Japan:  On March 21, 8000 large customers (30% of the market)
              were allowed to choose a supplier.  This broke the monopolies
              of the ten regional IOUs for the first time, but high
              transmission access fees set by the incumbents are inhibiting
              true competition. Newer liberalization measures in the
              electricity and gas sectors have since been written --  an
              agreement was signed at the July G8 Summit which provides for
              fair and transparent non-discriminatory access to
              distribution networks in both sectors.  A number of new
              companies are entering (or planning to enter) the market,
              largely set up as JVs with local non-incumbents, often
              offering new products and services.
              In August the government awarded a tender to a non-utility,
              Diamond Power, a Mitsubishi unit, to supply electricity to
              the Ministry of Trade and Industry at a rate 4% lower than
              incumbent TEPCO's.  TEPCO plans to build a new nuclear plant
              to cut generation costs and plans to streamline operations in
              the face of increased competition.

           ?  Malaysia:  Jamaludin Jarjis was appointed as the new chairman
              of Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) in July.  He assured
              investors that restructuring begun three years ago by his
              predecessor would remain intact.  TNB will be transformed
              into two separate T&D companies by 2003, with an equity
              interest in generation.  Generation assets have already been
              separated into TNB Generation; thermal generation will be
              sold.   The government has approved the construction of more
              IPPs to meet the demand for electricity, which has grown 12%
              compared to the period before the economic crisis.  Work on
              the Bakun Hydro Project in East Malaysia has resumed, but it
              remains to be seen whether the project will go ahead as
              originally planned or on a smaller scale.

           ?  New Zealand: 1999 saw ECNZ split into three gencos to create
              further competition  -- Genesis Power, Meridian Energy, and
              Mighty River Power.  They have been corporatized but will
              remain under government ownership.  Legislation passed in
              1999 forbade ownership of wires (non-competitive) and
              generation and retailing (competitive) by the same company.
              Companies have until 2004 either to sell one business type or
              to set up a separate trust to own and run the businesses they
              do not wish to keep. By February '00, most had implemented
              full separation.  The newly merged (75.8%) NGC/TransAlta will
              be the largest energy retailer in New Zealand, with a market
              cap of NZ$2.1billion and more than 650,000 customers.

           ?  Pakistan:  Pakistan is trying to attract IPPs with negotiated
              PPAs which allow fixed ROR of 12%, but IPPs face continued
              lack of guarantees and other political uncertainties.
              Problems continue over Hub Power Company (Hubco), the largest
              IPP project in Pakistan.  Hubco is receiving significantly
              lower payments from WAPDA than originally contracted.  The
              government has alleged that corruption occurred when the PPA
              was amended in the 1990's, making the wholesale power tariff
              untenable for WAPDA and excessively lucrative for Hubco.
              More than 20% of plants have already been sold in a phased
              sell-off of WAPDA's generation.  Eight parties have been
              short-listed for the pending privatization of 51% of Karachi
              Electric Supply Commission, but the sale has been often
              delayed.

           ?  Philippines:   An Omnibus Electricity Bill, which will set
              the framework for the breakup and privatization of Napocor,
              is stalled in a House-Senate reconciliation committee.  The
              Asian Development Bank has threatened to withhold all
              financial assistance, including $100million in loans for
              power related projects, until the legislation is passed.
              Napocor is on the verge of bankruptcy and energy department
              officials are looking at several alternate options for
              selling the utility in the absence of a restructuring bill.
              Government-appointed advisers have also recommended that
              Napocor renegotiate some of its take-or-pay contracts with
              IPPs, asking some IPPs to reduce power off-take on an interim
              basis.  Napocor has offered the IPPs that accede to these
              conditions a longer life span for their projects, but
              developers are reluctant to accept because of their own
              financial commitments.

           ?  Singapore:  Since initial restructuring and corporatization
              in 1995 and the establishment of a pool in 1998, Singapore
              has lagged in power sector deregulation.  Investors complain
              that the market lacks clarity and that retail competition has
              yet to develop even though the rules allow competition for
              large consumers.  A thorough review in 1999 by the Ministry
              of Trade and Industry recommended that:  generation  be
              privatized, but with restrictions on generation
              cross-ownership; transmission and market operation functions
              be separated and an ISO established; and that most retail
              services be privatized.  The government has granted two
              public retail licenses, meaning that the two IPPs can sell
              electricity directly to large users.  Retail licenses are
              expected to be issued to the three power generators.  This
              will allow full competition for large industrial and
              commercial customers, but retail competition for smaller
              customers is unlikely to be in place before 2002.

           ?  South Korea: South Korea is proceeding with a major
              restructuring program, following government approval in July
              1999 for state-owned KEPCO to be broken up into six gencos.
              KEPCO will retain the nuclear assets as one genco.  Each of
              the five other gencos will be listed in stages on the Korea
              Stock Exchange; up to 30% foreign ownership will be
              permitted.  The privatized gencos will sell to KEPCO, which
              will initially retain its T&D services.  Later, a UK-type
              pool will be established where all generators will sell into
              the pool. Competition in distribution and retailing is a
              long-term target.  IPP projects totaling 2,515MW are already
              in operation.  Impending restructuring has not deterred
              foreign interest in several ongoing IPPs.

           ?  Taiwan: Two phases of IPP development have been approved, but
              only one IPP scheme has started up.   Developers have faced
              land acquisition problems, causing IPP schedules to slip.  In
              1999, the government announced plans to launch Phase Three,
              limited to gas-fired plants.  An Electricity Act is before
              Parliament.  Its main provisions include: privatizing
              Taipower without unbundling G-T-D; allowing other companies
              to enter the market as either vertically integrated,
              generation, transmission or distribution companies and to pay
              Taipower a fee for using its facilities; and the creation of
              an independent regulator, especially for tariffs.  IPPs will
              be able to supply customers at 161kV and above, and IPP
              prices will not be regulated.

           ?  Thailand: The 1999 State Enterprise Corporatization Act laid
              out a three-stage process for all state-owned enterprises,
              including power, to create fully competitive, restructured
              and privatized sectors.  A draft Energy Act is under
              discussion, while preparation and implementation of various
              technical frameworks are underway. Under the Act, a
              competitive wholesale pool would be introduced in 2003,
              although some sources doubt that it could be ready by then.
              It is also unclear how soon Thailand will have a transparent
              and independent regulatory body. EGAT transferred two thermal
              units to Ratchaburi following its IPO in October; EGAT also
              plans to corporatize and partially privatize its non-hydro
              plants by 2003.  Before the economic crisis, the government
              had an ambitious IPP program; EGAT now has excess capacity,
              so has delayed many projects.  Its long-term plans include
              the construction of a series of Small Producer Plants (SPPs)
              using renewable energy.  PPAs have been signed with 50 SSPs.

           ?  Vietnam: Vietnam is in the nascent stages of reforming its
              power system. Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) is an unbundled
              state monopoly, which does not even service rural customers.
              Local villages provide services to small farmers and small
              commercial businesses using thin wires and low standards. The
              World Bank has approved a $150million credit to Vietnam to
              extend grid electricity to about 450,000 households scattered
              throughout the country.  A few IPPs are trying to win
              generation projects.   An Electricity Law due to be enacted
              in 2001 would establish a National Electricity Office for
              regulation.   This would replace the existing haphazard
              village-level regulatory system.





      Profoundly affected by inflation and currency fluctuations, many
      Latin American countries have postponed further privatizations.  At
      the same time, ownership limits imposed by several governments limit
      further investments by companies who have already entered the market.
      According to the Inter-American Development Bank, privatization of
      electricity distribution and generation has been accomplished in all
      of the major Latin American economies with the exceptions of
      Venezuela and Mexico.  It estimates that 75 million Latin Americans
      are still not connected to the grid in rural areas of poorer
      countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and some Central American countries.
      Many of the countries that have not already implemented reforms are
      beginning to propose regulatory structures that would open markets to
      investments.  And for those who were already open, a new development
      is the increasing number of transmission systems being offered either
      as concessions to build or as full privatizations.  A big factor
      impacting generation this year has been the region's heavy reliance
      on hydro-power.  Serious region-wide droughts during the last few
      years have caused power shortages and scared away some investors.


           ?  Argentina:  The big news is in Argentina transmission sector.
              This fall, Argentina auctioned off 25% of Transener in an
              IPO, while also offering six lines to the private sector on a
              B-O-M (build-operate-maintain) basis. Endesa (Spain) must
              divest one of its two Buenos Aires distributors due to
              antitrust concerns  (Endesa's two companies are now serving
              40% of the countries 36 million people).  The regulator
              believes that the two holding inhibit its ability to evaluate
              efficiency and to set prices.

           ?  Brazil:   Brazil's wholesale energy market (WEM) began
              operating in October; initially, only 5-10% of power bought
              or sold will go through WEM.  As other contracts expire it
              will eventually supervise $15 billion worth of power.  The
              WEM intends also to create an internet-based trading system.
              The Brazilian system, 95% hydro-run, is dependent on
              plentiful rains to avoid shortages.   Demand growth has far
              outstripped GDP, while new generation is not keeping pace.
              Analysts predict a 15% shortage in 2001, with intermittent
              brownouts, while neighbors are building generation with an
              eye to exporting power to Brazil.
              Sao Paulo state will sell 38.6% of CESP Parana, one of the
              last large generation privatizations,  in December.  The
              state is incenting buyers by offering financing for any
              premium paid over the minimum price of R1.74 billion (US$
              901mil).  Brazil also conducted a successful action of three
              transmission lines in August on a build-operate basis.

           ?  Bolivia:  Ende, Bolivia's utility, was unbundled in '94 and
              has been successively sold off through capitalization (a 50%
              stake and management control).  To meet demand rising at 7.5%
              annually, the government has ordered these buyers to invest
              $296 million in the next three years or face losing their
              concessions; they have not fulfilled previous obligations in
              upgrades.   Generators recently defeated an attempt to allow
              distributors to generate up to 30% of demand instead of 15%.

           ?  Chile: Privatization in Chile is largely complete. Endesa's
              (Spain) controversial takeover of Enersis (Chile) will be the
              basis for its diversification into telecom, via its
              subsidiaries Enersis and Chilectra.  Partially in response to
              Endesa's vertical dominance, partially in response to supply
              conditions engendered by prolonged drought, and partially to
              increase competition, Chile has proposed new regulation plans
              which will open the distribution market and reduce node
              (unregulated) prices from 2MW to 0.2 MW.  Until now,
              transmission charges have been based on existing operating
              costs. Under the proposed reform, they would be calculated on
              the operational costs of an optimum network. The reforms also
              intended to remove control of the grid operation from the
              generators.  The proposed changes likely account for Hydro
              Quebec's being the sole bidder among those pre-qualified for
              the 100% sale of Transelec in September.
              1999 marked a serious recession and drought, seriously
              affecting hydro generators, which represent nearly 80% of
              Chile's generation.  Under the existing system, generators
              had no incentive to plan for long-term supply.  Chile hopes
              the new regulations will break down the entry barriers to
              generation and to introduce competition into distribution,
              heretofore a monopoly.

           ?  Colombia: Continuing labor strikes plus terrorist attacks
              against transmission installations have forced the government
              to postpone the sale of any further power assets, including
              Isagen, the state generator, ISA, the transco, as well as 14
              regional distributors. (A March attack, for instance, caused
              a blackout in 9 provinces and most of Bogota for six hours or
              more.)  The government claims to be reassessing the rules,
              but the reality is that the assets would not receive any
              decent offer now.  For now, 100- 300 million new shares
              (13.5% of capital) in ISA will be sold to the public at a 15%
              discount, to "democratize" the power sector. Since January
              '00, 90% of the market has had choice.

           ?  Cuba:  The first IPP began delivering power to Cuba's grid in
              October '98.  In order to curb programmed blackouts, it has
              invited foreign investors to help discover and develop new
              crude reserves.  Cuba hopes that 70% of its power will be
              generated from local fuels by year-end.

           ?  Dominican Republic: Blackouts still plague this nation a year
              after the government split state-owned CDE into separate
              G-T-D units.  Investors paid $750 for a 50% stake and
              management control of non-hydro generation and of
              distribution.  The new government is requiring IPPs (who
              provide 40% of the republic's power) to renegotiate the terms
              of the privatization contracts signed with the prior
              government.  In the hopes of increasing competition and
              lowering prices, the gencos are planning a power
              clearinghouse through which they will sell electricity to T&D
              companies.  It will, however, "only function when there is
              adequate electricity to meet demand."

           ?  Ecuador: The government has hired Salomon to oversee the sale
              of its power sector.  There is a current investment limit of
              39%, which may need to be raised to 51%.  The government
              realizes that reforms will need to come before privatization
              in order to attract capital.  Its largest utility, EMELEC,
              will be sold in international bidding to pay off extensive
              debts.

           ?  El Salvador: In October, AES bought Reliant's interest in
              three discos (privatized in 1998), which together serve 60%
              of the population.  CEL, the SOU, does not plan to privatize
              its hydro assets or the transmission grid for the moment.

           ?  Guatemala:  Guatemala sold two major discos in 1998;
              investors have made significant system upgrades.  State
              utility INDE still owns 45% of the country's generation, all
              in hydro.  It extensively encouraged IPPs in the early 90s
              with take-or-pay PPAs; IPPs are allowed unrestricted grid
              access.  The power sector, while needing new investment for
              the next five years, may soon be in trouble due to currency
              devaluation, high fuel costs, and the effect of the PPAs.
              Guatemala also needs to finish writing the implementing
              regulations to their 1997 law to encourage more investment.

           ?  Jamaica:  For the second time in four years, the Jamaican
              government has proposed a partial privatization of PSC, which
              handles all of T&D and 75% of the island's generation.  And,
              for the second time, it is Southern who is in the forefront
              of privatization negotiations.  It is still not clear what
              percent will be sold, but it seems likely to be a marginal
              minority of 45%, without G-T-D first being spun-off.

           ?  Mexico: The new Fox administration plans to revive
              electricity reform, tabled last year, without which energy
              cannot keep pace with economic growth.  Fox says there will
              be no privatizations, but an opening of the market.  Private
              participation in the distribution sector would require a
              constitutional change.  Many believe that constitutional
              change will be necessary to achieve adequate reforms.
              Mexico estimates it needs investments of $25 billion in the
              power sector in the next five years to meet growing demand;
              reserve margins are at 6%, while consumption is growing at 6%
              - 8% annually.  Without a clear regulatory bill opening the
              market to competition, investment is inhibited.  IPPs have
              heretofore been built on a B-O-O basis.  Recent tenders have
              included the option to build either in the U.S. or Mexico,
              with power dedicated to Mexico.

           ?  Nicaragua:   The privatization of state-owned power company
              (ENEL) is underway, following its restructuring.  Assets were
              first split into G-T-D companies.  In September '00, Spain's
              Union Fenosa acquired 95% of two discos for $115 million in
              an auction in which it was the sole bidder. High oil prices
              forced the government to postpone the October sale of the
              three gencos; two of the three pre-qualified companies failed
              to submit final bids.  Also, the political opposition has
              challenged the legality of the privatization in the Supreme
              Court.

           ?  Panama: Privatization of government-held IRHE is now
              complete; 51% of distribution and generation was sold in
              1998. The government plans to retain control of transmission.
              Foreign investors are involved in building some generation.
              The big news is the Central American integrated grid, which
              should join Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua,
              Costa Rica, and Panama into a single market by 2006.  The
              IADB is running project.

           ?  Peru: The new Energy Minister, Chamot, favors re-starting the
              privatization program, stalled since September '99.  SOUs
              mentioned for privatization were six regional energy
              companies, as well as a 850MW Andean hydro complex, Mantaro.
              It was not clear what form privatization would take; nor is
              it clear what will happen now that Fujimori has resigned and
              fled.  Peru also announced bids for construction and
              operation of two transmission lines.  Currently, only large
              industrials, representing 10% of the market, have choice.
              There are no plans to expand this.

           ?  Trinidad and Tobago: While there has been a partial
              unbundling of the generation arm of T&TEC, the government
              utility retains control of T&D as well as of all of natural
              gas purchases.  There been neither much IPP nor privatization
              activity since the sale of 49% of T&TEC to Southern and BP
              Amoco in 1996 and the financing of one IPP in 1998.

           ?   Venezuela: The Chavez government imposed an electricity
              restructuring law in August 1999.  Industrials can choose
              their supplier, but there are no plans to open the market
              completely.  A wholesale market is proposed for 2002.
              Venezuela has the lowest tariffs in the Western hemisphere,
              due to high subsidization.  While the government dithered on
              privatization plans, AES jumped in with a surprise bid for
              the ADRs of Electricidad de Caracas.  The government recently
              announced a tentative sale date of early 2001 for 51% of two
              regional electric companies, Enelven and Semda.
              Privatization has oft been postponed, most recently because
              of unknown effects of Venezuela's new electricity law on its
              rate policy.

           ? Virgin Islands: In September '00, this U.S. territory's Senate
             quashed a deal in which Southern had privately negotiated for
             an 80% purchase of the Water and Power Authority.  The Islands
             could use the money, but the Senate objected to the lack of
             bidding or transparency.  It was in principle opposed neither
             to privatization nor to Southern.






      African and Middle Eastern governments are increasingly opening their
      power sectors to foreign investment, although most have not moved
      beyond allowing IPPs.  Many Gulf-States' IPPs are for water and
      power.   Increasingly, power sector forecasts include reliance on the
      private sector for generation capacity additions.  Five Sub-Saharan
      countries have privatized their power systems: C"te d'Ivoire, Gabon,
      Guinea, Mali, and Senegal.  A few countries are beginning to discuss
      partial privatization of the entire government-owned entity, rather
      than spinning off G-T-D and undergoing separate privatization.


      Heavy reliance on hydro power in some areas of Africa have put
      pressure on prices, due to sustained droughts, especially in East
      Africa.   Droughts are usually not conducive to advancing
      restructuring agendas in different countries.


      A notable regional trend in both Africa and the Middle East are the
      schemes for regional transmission links.   The Mozambique
      Transmission Company links South Africa, Mozambique, and Swaziland;
      the West African Power Pool will link 16 countries; there is a
      Six-Country link underway between Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Syria, and
      Turkey, and later Lebanon.


           ?  Algeria: Interior minister Khelil, who as a World Bank
              official oversaw the restructuring of state oil companies in
              several countries, is committed to "a profound restructuring
              of Sonatrach (the NOC) and the power sector (Sonelgaz)."
              Legislation was introduced this summer that would unbundle
              G-T-D, end Sonelgaz' generation monopoly, and allow for IPPs
              on a B-O-T basis. Some of the IPPs are intended for domestic
              consumption, and some for export.  Algeria is keenly
              interested in sending power to deregulating European markets
              via a new undersea link to Spain.

           ?  Ghana:  With a vast hydroelectric station on the Volta River,
              98% of Ghana's current power needs are supplied by
              hydroelectricity. Ghana's planned privatization of its
              distribution company into 4-5 regional companies is possible
              in 2001.  It is implementing a series of power sector reforms
              designed to provide Ghanaians with universal access to
              electricity and to transform Ghana into a middle-income
              country within one generation.  It is moving to reduce its
              reliance on hydro-power by allowing IPPs to build deisel,
              gas, and light crude plants.  Regionally, Ghana is committed
              to building a West African Power Pool (WAPP) by expanding
              electricity generation and interconnections.

           ?  Morocco:  Two distribution concessions are due to be awarded
              for Tangiers and Tetouan.  The concession covers the
              provision of water, sewerage, and electrical services to
              these two northern areas. Two earlier power/water concessions
              (Casablanca, Rabat) were awarded.  Morocco has an active IPP
              program; one of the plants was even transferred to the
              builders after its completion.  No sale of transmission
              assets is planned.

           ?  Nigeria: The IMF has provided Nigeria a $1billion facility to
              encourage reform and to support civilian President Obasnjo.
              In November, the government announced plans to privatize

              ailing NEPA, the SOU. While a draft electricity policy has
              been prepared, no details have emerged.  They intend to send
              regulatory legislation to the parliament by the end of
              December, which should include a framework for foreign IPP
              investors.  It is also likely that NEPA will be broken up,
              prior to privatization. Enron is supplying 270MW via 9
              barge-mounted power facilties off Lagos to ease the power
              shortages in this oil-rich country.

           ?  Senegal: Showing how risky foreign investment remains, the
              new Senegalese government has asked Hydro Qu,bec and Elyo to
              leave, less than two years after they won a 34% interest in
              state EU S,n,lec.  The current government, while
              acknowledging the advances made in rehabilitating old plants,
              cited cronyism on the part of its predecssors.

           ?  South Africa: Eskom, South Africa's parastatal, generates 95%
              of the country's power, and transmits it over national lines
              to municipal distributors.  South Africa is moving slowly
              towards restructuring and unbundling of G-T-D.  The
              fragmented distribution system will be merged into six
              discos, while plants may be grouped into gencos. Last year,
              G-T-D activities were "ring-fenced" to evaluate costs for
              each business.  A new structure for the electricity supply
              industry is being discussed, and the possibility of
              privatizing 30% of Eskom's power stations has been raised for
              the first time. Electricity regulators announced in November
              that they were considering three bids for the first IPP
              license, to be offered next year. While South Africa needs
              new generation capacity by 2004, it now exports power to its
              neighbors, and is very active in the creation of a regional
              transmission network.  Eskom has ambitions to be a global
              player, while continuing to focus on its development agenda
              of rural electrification.  Eskom Enterprises, the unregulated
              business subsidiary, is considering an IPO.

           ?  Egypt: In July, the Egyptian Electricity Authority was
              converted into a holding company, although still state-owned.
              It intends to offer 49% stakes in seven or eight regional G&D
              companies.  The sale of Greater Cairo Electricity, valued at
              $2.1 billion, will be first, although it has been twice
              postponed.  All capacity additions will be solicited
              competitively as IPPs under the BOOT (build- own- operate-
              transfer) model. This allows developers to recover
              construction costs by running a plant, while the state
              eventually owns the project without affecting its debt
              profile.   Egypt is part of a planned Six-Country
              transmission link.

           ?  Israel: Israel has been discussing restructuring and
              privatization for a few years now, but no real progress has
              been made. An electricity law passed in March '96 extended
              the Israel Electric Company (IEC) license for 10 years in
              exchange for its accepting 10% of it power needs (900MW) from
              IPPs, and another 10% from foreign developers. So far, only
              one IPP has been built.  Recent offshore gas discoveries have
              been largely in Palestinian waters; further exploration will
              be necessary before Israel, which has no indigenous fuel
              sources, knows whether it will have an assured fuel supply.

           ?  Jordan: With virtually no indigenous oil or gas, Jordan has
              been highly dependent on Iraqi oil.  In early '98, NEPCO, the
              state utility, was corporatized, and G-T-D was unbundled.
              Jordan's first solicited IPP (450MW) was awarded to Tractebel
              in May.  There is talk of relying on IPPs for further
              generation and of privatizing existing assets.  Consultants
              were sought in August to advise Jordan on distribution
              privatization.  Jordan's transmission grid was linked to
              Egypt in '98; the link to Syria should be completed soon.

           ?  Kuwait: Lifting a freeze on large projects, the cabinet has
              allowed two new IPPs (1000MW, 2500MW) with possible private
              financing options.  Forcasts for power show 5500 new MW
              needed in the next 15 years.

           ?  Lebanon:  After years of war, Lebanon is now engaged in
              massively rebuilding its infrastructure.  In April,
              consultants were invited to bid on advising Lebanon on
              restructuring and eventual privatization of its power sector.
              Lebanon was admitted in May to the planned Six-Country
              regional transmission linkup.

           ?  Palestine:   The outlook for Palestine's energy independence
              changed in a moment this Autumn, with offshore gas fields in
              acknowledged Palestinian waters proving substantial.  It has
              been nearly totally dependent on Israel's IEC for power.

           ?  Qatar: Officials announced in February that they had invited
              five companies to submit proposals for an IPP.  Foreign
              developers would hold a 60% stake in a plant envisioned to
              begin at 200MW, rising later to 1100MW.  A decision would
              turn on a bid of less than 5.5 cents/kWh to generate power.
              Qatari nationals pay no power or water tariffs.

           ?  Saudi Arabia: Saudi Arabia's 5% demand growth has created a
              need for an additional 50GW of capacity by 2020, much of
              which will need to come from the private sector.
              Privatization of the sector is being considered, as is an
              unbundling of G-T-D.  As a first step, in February, the ten
              power companies were merged.  In April, the Saudi Electricity
              Company was created as a joint-stock company, 50%
              government-owned.  The consensus among potential investors is
              that much needs to be done on the regulatory system, the
              financial framework, and on tariffs before IPPs become
              feasible.  For instance, nationals pay only nominal amounts
              for power.  Early considerations of BOT projects to meet
              soaring demand were shelved.

           ?  Tunisia: The Parliament passed enabling legislation for
              independent power in April '96.  While the government will
              continue to control D-T and international trade, all new
              generation will be open to the private sector.  The first
              IPP, for 471MW, is scheduled to come online in 2001.  It will
              produce 20-25% of Tunisia's electricity.

           ?  United Arab Emirates: The UAE is a confederation of 7
              Emirates.  Political power is concentrated in Abu Dhabi; it
              and Dubai provide over 80% of UAE income.  In '98, the UAE
              called for comprehensive restructuring of the power/water
              authority, and for privatization through IPOs aimed at UAE
              nationals.  While privatization in Abu Dhabi is still
              anticipated, Dubai has decided not to privatize these
              sectors.  Several IPPs are underway in Abu Dhai and Dubai, as
              both BOO and BOOT. The UAE's need for additional power may be
              met by a grid linking several Gulf States' systems, which is
              under discussion between the UAE, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar,
              Kuwait, and Bahrain.

Steve:  As discussed, I spoke with Clay and raised the points we discussed.  
Thus, I'm a bit surprised to receive this "cover" type memo.  To be clear 
with you, as I was with Clay (he repeated back my message verbatim so I feel 
he understood the issue), the issue is not maintaining excellent 
relationships, rather the issue is inappropriate requests for insider 
information.  By the way, the Administration meeting which set off the 
problem, Clay stated he doesn't remember where that information came from.  I 
have followed up with DOE and the Hill as discussed.  Please let me know if 
we need to do anything further.  thanks.

Dear Cynthia:

Just wanted to follow up with you from our conversation this morning.  Our 
office completely understands that maintaining excellent relations with your 
government contacts is the highest priority.  We therefore understand the 
need to cease inquiries on current issues.  We would never suggest taking any 
actions that could even be construed as improper, and we are continuously 
ensuring that our own work adheres to this principle.

We regret any difficulties that have arisen as a result of your making 
inquiries on our behalf.  We will ensure that similar problems do not arise 
in any future cooperative efforts between our offices.

Thanks again for your assistance.

Best regards,

Clay Seigle
Enron North America

		 Subject: FERC's marketing affiliate conference

Becky and I attended FERC's gas marketing affiliate conference last week.  
Non-affiliated competitors continue to build straw men and describe abuses 
with no real evidence to back them up (the funny money argument and capacity 
hoarding are two examples.  The funny money argument assumes marketing 
affiliates will bid above market rates for capacity because they excess 
payment is going to the corporate bottom line.  Hoarding capacity to drive up 
price  may be an issue, but it is not a marketing affiliate issue, as anyone 
can do it). FERC staff did not seem terribly sympathetic to the points made, 
but at least one FERC staffer seemed to believe that one solution would be to 
require the pipelines to offer capacity in smaller blocks to let smaller 
entities put together bids.  FERC also indicated they were in fact auditing 
compliance, but in a non-public way.

There were some concerns voiced which I agree with and there is an 
opportunity to file additional comments on Apr. 30.  I would like to put the 
following in these comments:

Evidence of affiliate abuse/preference is just not there.  The best folks can 
do is make up stuff.
We welcome FERC monitoring if that is needed to bring confidence to the 
marketplace that abuse is not occurring.  But the issue is really whether we 
do have a crisis of confidence or merely a bunch of disgruntled competitors 
who are just seeking to neutralize the affiliated competitors).
The FERC rules and the information reported (with a caveat) under those rules 
are adequate for detection and enforcement and deterrence.
That said, the definition of marketing affiliate should be expanded to 
include affiliated electric generators, who are siting plants along affiliate 
pipelines.
The pipeline 637 reporting and internet systems should allow users to 
download and manipulate transportation related data, which is not currently 
the case.

We also need to address a deal on Northern where ENA took capacity at a 
discount, albeit after other parties had an opportunity to match our bid.  
This was a deal brought up in the conference.

Let me know how this sounds. Thanks.

I have looked it over.  I think they would do a good job.  Another idea:  
Dick Foster (advisor to Enron's Board and Senior Director at McKinsey) has a 
great book out: "Creative Destruction".  I was on a panel with him recently 
where he shared some of his research.  He is a very good presenter; he knows 
Enron well; and his work is first rate.  He might be a good addition.  I have 
an idea on the breakout sessions.  It needs some work but I'd like to talk it 
through with you.

Subject: Funky Business

Steve,

Have you had a chance to look at the book "Funky Business" and to give any 
thought to having Jonas present at the Management Conference?  I know you 
have a thousand other things on your plate, not the least of which is 
California, so I understand if the answer is no.  However, they've been 
contacted by someone else about the date so we may be forced to decide rather 
soon.

On a related subject, I'm contemplating another topic for the conference.  
I'd seen an article in Fortune several months ago titled "Managing for the 
Slowdown."  It talked about new challenges managers face in light of the 
economic downturn.  (Most young managers have never experienced anything but 
boom times.)  The article also outlines a dozen or so things companies should 
be thinking about now.  (Use the downturn as a new opportunity to evaluate 
people.  Overhaul your budget process.  Don't stop communicating. etc.)  I 
think it would be beneficial to address similar strategies and ideas with our 
managers.  I'd love to get your thoughts on this idea.  (Is it appropriate 
for Enron or am I just seeing the world through bleak-colored glasses?)

 Terrie:

 We received an e-mail today from the Funky Business office asking about the
 date we have on hold with Enron.  They have another inquiry about that date 
and
 wondered if Enron is still considering using Jonas.  If you are still
 considering them I will keep him on hold.  And if they get a firm offer I 
will
 let you know immediately.  We will have 24 hours to make an offer or release
 the hold once a firm offer comes in from another company.

 Hope you had a great 4th of July,

I meant to send you an article some time ago on the UK water business (now 
cannot find it).  I do not make it my habit to follow this sector, and we 
have never discussed my following this here in the UK.  However, I just 
wanted you to be aware, and you can pass along as you see fit, that recent 
developments in the UK water sector should create new business opportunities 
for Wessex (and, indeed, trade press here reports as much).  I am also not 
trying to "end run" either Colin Skellett (CEO) or Keith Harris (reg. affaris 
at Wessex), both of whom I have a high regad for.  just wanted to get this 
into the right circles.  The development is the "mutualisation" of water 
distribution companies.  This was proposed last year by Kelda, in England, 
and turned down by the water regulator.  It is essentially securitising the 
future income streams of the pipes business, servicing bonds, and making the 
customers the owners (there is essentially no equity stake).  Thus, the 
license obligation to invest in infrastructure is on the customers themselves 
(raises interesting enforcement problems).  The "services" part of the 
business is "outsourced" on a competitive basis (this is where Wessex would 
come in).  As I noted, such a proposal has previously been rejected.  Now, 
though, it is proposed to "mutualise" the Welsh water company.  Normally the 
regulator would reject this, for being unsound along the same lines as the 
earlier proposal.  However, the leaders of this "mutualisation" effort in 
Wales are 200 of the "great and the good" leaders of the Welsh business 
community, and it is seen as a source of Welsh "national" pride to take back 
ownership of their water industry, i.e., meaning it is going to happen.  We 
now have a new water regulator who is smart enough not to stand in the way of 
Welsh politics, and has said he thinks the proposal has some merit and he 
will look not reject it out of hand.  Wessex could bid on the "services" 
agreement for this company, and if approved, this "mutualisation" will open 
the door for others to follow, and and hence more opportunities for Wessex.  
Hope this is of some interest and use to you.   mcs

Thank you very much for the note.  Sorry I am so late replying (I am on my 
way to another round -- House hearings this time -- and was recalling your 
note).  It is amazing to me how many people saw the hearing on C-span 
(nothing worthwhile on the Weather Channel, I guess).  Thanks again, and 
welcome aboard.

Mr. Kean,

I would like to tell you I watched your testimony  from Wednesday's Senate 
hearing on C-Span and was very proud to be a member of the Enron team.

I am a new employee in the Gas Logistics department, scheduling PG&E 
Northwest for the West Desk (Rockies).  I am also new to the industry and 
unfamiliar with most external factors affecting the current situation 
regarding the sell of Natural Gas to California.  I found your presentation 
and testimony enlightening, direct, and informative.

Thank you for showing to the world Enron is synonymous with intelligence, 
knowledge, and respect.

Respectfully,
Daniel Lisk

the format looks good to me.  I'd suggest that you prepare the talking points 
for Jeff and schedule some time to brief him in advance.  I got a response 
from ted on Fri to the voicemail i left for him.  It sounded like he fully 
understood your role and would take the appropriate steps with respect to the 
recruiters.  Is it straightened out now?

		 Subject: News Conference Layout

Scheduled for Febr. 1 at 2pm.

Location - at a fire station in a Hispanic Community - exact location will be 
forwarded shortly but estimated distance from ENE office = less than 15 min.

Expect News Conference to last a total of 30 minutes, including Q&A. Jeff 
Skilling will be spokesperson for Selection Committee. However, we will try 
to have as many committee members present as possible. 

Mayor will likely discuss (estimated time = 10 min.):
 - changes that are required at HFD - potential need to bring in an outsider, 
etc...
 - reasoning behind involvement of Enron/Jeff Skilling & formation of 
selection committee - de-politicize the process, etc...

JS should speak about the following (estimated time = 10-15 min.):
 - how he became involved in the process
 - how the committee members were selected
 - who the members are with a brief background on each (We plan to provide a 
bio on each of the committee members as part of the press release)
 - time line for Fire Chief selection 

Q&A (estimated time = 5-10 min.)
 - expect questions along the lines of: Are the meetings going to be open or 
closed?, Outsider vs. Insider related questions...

Please let me know if you have any questions/comments/issues with the above. 
I'll coordinate collection of Bios from Committee members. Anything else I 
can do to help out here?

Lisa

There are a few other issues we need to look into:

Larcamp told Hartsoe and I after the meeting that FERC may clarify that the 
price caps and reporting obligations apply only to bids into the PX and ISO 
-- ie no bilateral transaction will be subject to the requirements.  He asked 
if knowing this would change any of our views (esp peaking plants, though I 
suspect it's already too late for that).  My gut reaction is that so long as 
the market continues to clear through the centralized exchanges this 
"exemption" for bilateral transactions won't matter much, but let's think it 
through.  Is EOL or APX an alternative?
Massey specifically asked us to address forward markets in our comments.  
Specifically, "has FERC done everything it can to encourage forward market 
development?"  In addition to any other points we might make, I think we 
should argue that "PJMing" the market won't facilitate and may even hinder 
forward market development.  Also, we should advocate actions by FERC that 
take away second-guessing by the CPUC in order to reduce utility fears about 
contracting forward.
We have to give the Commission a way out on price caps.  We need to think 
through whether there is something we can live with here, or we should take 
the approach I took in my testimony:  FERC should encourage the state to 
provide rate protection for selected customer classes by putting those 
requirements up for bid (ie get the utility out of the commodity business as 
much as possible).
Finally, on governence issues we should argue for a narrowe role for the ISO 
as a way of diffusing the emotional governence debate.  Analogy:  if the ISO 
is simply the air traffic controller all parties will simply be interested in 
retaining the most technically competent people (not hiring or appointing 
their lackies or friends).  So long as the ISO has a role in setting prices, 
acquiring supplies or running the market, it is destined to be controversial 
and highly politicized.  Those functions should be left to the market.

issues raised in the FERC meeting today that we might consider putting in our

already raised in our white paper and our oral comments at FERC.  Of course 
to the extent we have discussed things in our white paper we could simply

Great presentation, as always.  I think you should add a brief set of talking 
points:  what are the key messages we want to convey? what, if anything, can 
we ask Martens to do that would allow some progress in the short run?

Maureen: please get this to Ricardo (he's at the EBS offsite this am).

We are in the process of distilling this list down to its essentials, and 
when we are done, I will forward it along to the group.  So as not to hold 
you up, I am attaching a comprehensive list of proposed legislation in both 
the Assembly and the Senate in California, along with short summary of what 
each piece of legislation purports to do.

Thanks-

Attached is a new version of the power cost model incorporating Roger's 
updated info (retained generation costs and QF capacity payments).  It 
improves the outlook for PG&E by > $2.00/MWH, mainly as a result of lower 
cost estimates for their hydro.  SCE's numbers remains about the same.  FYI, 
the prices in the model are at mid.  The switch to change to offer is now on 
the Summary page.

Apparently there are rumors that Ken Lay promised to make some kind of

million in DSM?)  Do any of you know what this commitment might be?  Sandy

Steve, Jim, Mike:

You may be aware that Enron officials have in the past met with international 
opinion leaders visiting the US as part of the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowship 
(EEF) program. The EEF is an international leadership exchange program that 
promotes international understanding and productivity through the exchange of 
information, ideas, and perspectives among emerging leaders throughout the 
world. Ken Lay is a member of the EEF Board of Trustees.

Enron will be hosting three EEF visitors from India on Wednesday, October 18, 
2000:

Mr. Sanjeev Ahluwalia, Secretary of the Central Electricity Regulatory 
Commission; 
Mr. Sreenivasan Jain, Newscaster, New Delhi TV; and 
Mr. Jawed Usmani, Joint Secretary, Office of the Prime Minister.

I am preparing a day program at Enron for the three persons, two of whom -  
Sanjeev Ahluwalia and Jawed Usmani - are interested in learning more about 
the US regulatory environment. Mr. Ahluwalia also wants to learn more about 
US environmental policy in both local and global contexts (please refer to 
attached bios for more details).

I would be grateful if either Steve or Jim could meet with the above persons 
for 30-45 minutes to discuss regulatory issues. Similarly, if Mike could be 
available to meet with Mr. Ahluwalia re environmental issues. Please let me 
know if you are available either between 10:00 - 12:00 noon or 3:30 - 5:00 
p.m. on Wednesday, October 18, 2000. If you are unavailable, it would be 
appreciated if one of your other colleagues could assist in this regard.

Many thanks,

Johan

I think you have picked the two most interesting industries.  Because energy 
and telecom both have natural monopoly characteristics, the government gets 
involved in economic regulation (not just the usual environment, safety, 
labor and other types of regulation which all businesses are subject to).  
That means that there is constant interplay between policy makers and the 
business community and that policy makers have alot to say about which 
business strategies will be successful.

Cessna TU206G Pipeline Patrol Aircraft

Fred, below is the report from my chief of Maintenance regarding the Black 
Mesa aircraft.

In a nut shell, after reviewing this information, I feel it would be 
appropriate to contract for this service.  The liabilities associated with it 
are not worth it when you consider it can be done, probably less than you are 
paying now, by a local provider and receive the same results.  
We would be more than happy to provide you with an approximate value for the 
aircraft and get you in touch with a broker to sell the TU206G.  
If you plan on continuing this operation with the Mesa owned aircraft, I 
suggest you put the responsibility in the hands of an aviation contractor who 
will be ultimately responsible to Mesa, not only with the upkeep of the 
aircraft, services/reports desired on patrol, but also the contracting of 
flight crews.
If you desire, we will locate a contractor in Arizona to review the 
operation.  I would expect the cost not to exceed $2,000-$3,000 at the most.  
Please call if you have any other questions or if you desire any additional 
help.

Subject: Black Mesa Pipeline Co
Cessna TU206G Pipeline Patrol Aircraft

Gary,
I spoke with a Mr. Sil Perla, pipeline patrol manager for Black Mesa Pipeline 
Co., Tele 520-774-5076.  As follows:

Aircraft:    1977 Cessna TU206G "Turbo Stationaire" Six place single engine 
high wing aircraft
Hours:    ACTT 3270 Engine Time since new 350 hrs  PropTime since overhaul 
1725.0 hrs (O/H date unknown)
Insp Program:   50/100 hr inspections and Annual Inspections.  Approximately 
two 100 hr inspections per year average.  Last Annual inspection     
completed July 1999.

1) No maintenance performed "in-house".  All maintenance performed at Arizona 
Aircraftsman Inc., Presscott, Arizona.  This facility is a Certified Repair 
Sation and a Cessna factory authorized service center.
2) Maintenance is scheduled by the pilots.  Mr. Perla doesn't appear to get 
envolved in the scheduling of maintenance.  I spoke with Mr. John Aderholt at 
Arizona Aircraftsman, Inc. and he said that the pilots schedule and deliver 
the aircraft for maintenance.  I asked how AD's and SB's were tracked and he 
seemed to feel that they weren't.  The only time AD's/SB's were checked was 
when the aircraft was in the maintenance facility.  Mr. Perla said he was not 
familiar with Airworthiness Directives (AD's) and more or less confirmed 
this.  Mr. AderholtArizona Aircraftsman said the aircraft was in very good 
condition and that it was a low time aircraft.  He said they did very 
thorough inspections and that Black Mesa usually didn't have a problem with 
any needed repairs.
3) The aircraft is used twice a month and flies a 546 mile trip at 300 feet 
above ground level, VFR day only.  The aircraft averages 20 - 40 hours per  
month.  Mr. Aderholt mentioned that the aircraft had flown 50 hours since the 
Annual inspection in July this year.  They occasionally will have a passenger 
but he said this is rare.  If someone wants to fly along the patrol the 
aircraft will stop and drop someone off at a plant, etc., but again this is 
rare.
4) He uses "rental pilots" for the patrols.  Currently he only has two he 
uses.  One has over 2000 multi/single time and the other has over 23000 hours 
in a little of everything.  The main "go-to" pilot is a gentleman named Rick 
Olsen; he's the 2000 + hr guy.  Mr. Perla said they both qualify for 
insurance purposes.
5) The pilots will review the maintenance logs for currency and accuracy and 
the repair invoices for discrepancies and action taken.  Mr. Perla didn't 
seem to get envolved in this.  I further confirmed this through Arizona 
Aircraftsman; that Mr. Perla definately does not get envolved in the 
maintenance of the aircraft.  He leaves it strictly to the pilots.  There are 
only two repetative AD's on the airplane, both due each 100 hrs.

Summary: Mr. Perla said he has been with Black Mesa for two or three years 
and that he was fairly new at this.  My impression is that he doesn't get 
envolved with the particulars of aviation and therefore doesn't really have 
much input as far as the actual operation and maintenance of the aircraft is 
concerned.  The aircraft itself is probably in very good condition and is a 
very reliable workhorse that can endure its fair share of rough usage.  
Although the aircraft is a simple and durable single engine aircraft; and its 
operation is relatively easy.  I believe it would be prudent to conduct a 
thorough review of the aircraft and records.  And establish a stable base of 
operations that is familiar with the legalities, and safe operation of a 
single engine aircraft.  In my opinion it appears that no one is paying 
attention to the details!
A few items in particular are:
a) The prop overhaul date is unkown.  The factory recommends an overhaul each 
five years.
b) No one is responsible for AD's and SB's.  Apparently they do not go to Mr. 
Perla, but to some other office.
c) Other details like ELT battery dates, operation in accordance with FAR's 
etc. may not be monitered adequately.
d) Mr. Perla mentioned that he is going to have some interior work and 
avionics upgrades next year.  Assuming his limited knowledge of aviation, 
what  assurances do we have of a legal and safe installation.

Subject: Virginia Manufacturers Association Seminar -- June 19, 2001


Sherry, thanks for your guidance concerning the possibility of an Enron
participant for the VMA's Seminar on Electric Utility Restructuring
scheduled for June 19, 2001.  I serve as Chairman of the VMA's Energy
Resources Committee which will be responsible for the seminar and the
day-long agenda it will entail.

As I explained, depending upon the availability of Mr. Skilling or another
key individual, the VMA  is offering Enron an opportunity to participate in
its seminar in an important way.  We seek to have Enron speak on the
subject of the developing competitive market and how that market may be
accessible and beneficial to VMA's member manufacturers which include many,
if not most, of the large companies residing in Virginia.  The purpose of
the seminar is entirely educational, as customers in Virginia will be able,
under the terms of the Electric Utility Industry Restructuring Act passed
in 1999, to choose their supplier of electricity as early as January 1,
2002, and by no later than January 1, 2003.  The subject is becoming a high
priority for VMA members, given the prominence of energy issues today
generally, and the imminence of the date when choice will be available to
Virginia customers.

We envision that Enron's message could be encouraging for VMA members who
today hear much about the dilemma in California (another seminar
participant will speak on the status of restructuring initiatives in
California and other states) and understandably wonder about the prospects
for successful competition and effective choice in Virginia.  Enron could
hopefully explain how market benefits might accrue to manufacturers once
the day of choice arrives, touching on Enron's online trading platform,
aggregation possibilities (an alternative which the VMA, as an umbrella
organization, is considering), and related topics.

The seminar will begin at 8:30am and conclude at 4:30pm, with the possible
Enron presentation beginning immediately following lunch at 1:00pm.  We
expect good attendance on the part of VMA members, and plan to offer
attendance opportunities to regulatory commission personnel, legislators
and others who have been closely involved  with the development of the
Virginia restructuring model as it has evolved over the past five years or
so.

I will appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience, and again
thank you for your assistance.  I will be happy to discuss the particulars
with you or anyone else, should that be helpful, and can be reached at
AEP's state office in Richmond at 804-698-5511.

This is very good work.  You make all the points we need to make without 
spraining anything in the process.  You have been doing a superb job under 
very difficult circumstances.

On another note:  I don't know if you received my page, but the meeting with 
Davis was cancelled so I flew back to Houston.  We are trying to get another 
time, perhaps as early as this week.  Davis did meet with Greenspan and 
Summers, both of whom we had briefed extensively.

You're right, Sue.  Rates can't go up w/out declaring the rate freeze over in 
some fashion---trying to finesse it.  Thanks very much for the comments.  
Harry also had a good comment---don't specify the amount of rate increase in 
our comments; rather note that the rate increase needs to be well-reasoned 
and based on facts and evidence.  Will make that change.

Jeff,

This looks good.  It comes across as moderate in tone-- although probably no 
one else will ask to leave the rate freeze in place. 

I have a legal question -- Under AB 1890, I don't see anyway that the CPUC 
can raise rates without ending the rate freeze first.  Am I missing 
something? So, how is it clear that the CCPUC can raise the rates on Feb 1?  
It's clear,however,  that once the retained assets are valued that the rates 
can be changed.

Jeff:

This is all Ok after the fact but I would have expected that we would have 
discussed this before action was taken. 

For the record, I would not advise calling this an arbitration BUT mediation 
and I would work with senior government officials and politicians ahead of 
time to control the fall out that may come about especially since Parliament 
is in session right now.

I will advise our PR group to say nothing to the press but route all queries 
to you.

Subject: Arbitration with Reliance and ONGC

I was in India last week meeting with partners and we all agreed that the 
best thing to do to move ahead regarding the old unrecovered cash calls 
("joint interest billings") was to file an arbitration proceeding and get an 
objective  third party to settle the issue.  As you know, Reliance and ONGC 
owe EOGIL approximately  $7.1 and $10.3 million, respectively (including 
interest on non-payment).  The arbitration notices reflected only the 
non-payment numbers which are $5.8 and $7.3 million for RIL and ONGC 
respectively.   We finalized the drafting and dated the notices on July 29th 
and we delivered the official notice during business hours Monday July 31, 
2000.  This was the final step in a very long effort to resolve this issue in 
other means, but as I noted to the OOC after the June meetings this was the 
only solution in the end.   While nobody likes to file arbitration, the good 
news is in the end all parties seen this as the only solution and as best as 
I can tell, at least internally ONGC and Reliance support this decision.  If 
the issue gets external, I don't know how any of the parties will respond.  
Our goal is to keep it as low keyed as possible, but this is India and I 
would expect someone to try to make a big issue out of it.

I will be in contact with John Ambler today to discuss the details of the 
submittal and to prepare for any response to the media that may be 
necessary.  While both parties were expecting the notice, it may leak into 
the media over the next few days.  Please defer any questions or comments to 
either John Ambler, Larry Morse or myself regarding this issue.  Until John 
advises us otherwise, our comment will be as follows;

" The parties (ONGC, Reliance and Enron Oil and Gas India Limited) have had a 
dispute on certain cost items and together we have agreed it is best for the 
joint venture to have this dispute resolved by an independent third party 
using the guidelines as set forth in the Joint Operating Agreement."

Mike Smalling in our office will coordinate this matter with John Ambler and 
the appropriate staff.   I will be available to respond if necessary and my 
contact numbers are as follows;

office-713-853-5934
pager 888-493-1770
cell 713-569-4713
home 281-320-2198

Larry, please make sure our office understands that only you are to comment 
on this and any other official E&P business in India and Wade/Sanjay would 
you share this note with the appropriate people in your office so nobody is 
surprised if something comes up.  Mike Smalling, John and/or I will keep you 
informed of any  relevant events.

Subject: Entry tax to dergulating markets



The Forbes April 30, 2001 editorial piece "Slow Starters" on page 24 discusses
the "entry tax" which is the capital burden for starting a new business.  It 
states that rich countries
on average have relatively low entry costs while poor countries have 
stagering entry costs caused
by corruption, endless beuacracy, and cost of delays.  These "entry hurdles" 
and asscoiated costs
do not produce any tangible benefits for consumers, workers or the 
environment.

We might want to make the analogy of "entry tax" for new deregulated gas & 
power markets.  Things like
negotiated third-party access (rather than regulated TPA) substantially slow 
the speed of new entrants and hence deter competition.
Negotiated TPA creates uncertainty for new entrants (they never know what 
they are going to get) and clearly slows
the new comers down.

I will send you a copy of the Forbes piece.

John

It was not mentioned to me.  I'm copying rosie and vanessa to find out if 
this was a simple referral (in which case you should keep the work to a

or whether Ken is especially interested in this and wants us to follow

Michelle - I think Linda would fill the spot you and I talked about very 
well.  Linda is the new head of our DC office; she was asst secy of treasury 
under Bentsen, Rubin and Summers.  She is very well respected in 
washington.  She received the Alexander Hamilton award fro Secy Summers -- 
the highest award presented by the US Treas dept.  She has gotten up to speed 
very quickly on our issues and I think would serve the progam well (and she's 
already paid for!!).

Guys, we have a unique capability at this time (ie) me in EES and Greg in EWS 
to have a singular voice in the regulatory market.  I would recommend a 
policy committee be formed including Greg, Dave, Janet Dietrich, John 
Lavorato, Tim Belden, Kevin Presto, Rick Shapiro and Steve Kean that meets on 
a regular basis to review and approve our regulatory agenda, policy and 
tactical moves on a regular basis.

Thoughts.....?

I think it's a good idea, but we will need a different summary ... either 
limit the summary to a couple of key points or provide an explanation, in 
layman's terms, of the practical effect of each of the changes.

What do you think of us sending out a U.S. Domestic employee mass e-mail 
asking our participants to lobby 
for passage of this very important bill.  I tried to make it more interesting 
than dry toast.

Let me know since this is heating up as you can see from the bulletin just 
received below.

p.s.  Obviously, I didn't get in enough protesting during my hippie years!





"In related news, the House Ways and Means Committee voted
35 to 6 to expand tax breaks for retirement savings plans.
The bill, which will go to the full House next week, would
increase the contribution level for IRAs from $2,000 to
$5,000, increase the annual dollar limits for 401(k) plans,
and allow employees over age 50 to "catch up" on pension
contributions they may have skipped when they were younger.

Just received a voicemail from Stan.  He knows Mike; he does not have any

I spent a little over 30 minutes with Robert.  He is a very sharp guy and has 
a great deal of relevant government experience.  While I don't have a 
position that would be suitable for his experience level (all of my senior 
positions are filled), he is definitely someone I would consider if I had an 
open position.

My impression from Robert is that, while he has some interest in Public 
Affairs, his main interest is in a commercial position.  I stressed to him 
that it would be difficult to come into Enron to run a business, but he could 
build to it over time.  His main concern was that he not get "lost in the 
system" if he came in at a level below business unit head.

I think Robert would be a good addition to Enron if 1) he is willing to come 
in to a commercial role at a more junior level to learn the system and 2) we 
can make sure that he gets the opportunity to have contact with senior levels 
of the organization from time to time.

Washington would be fine .... there's always plenty to do there.  I got a 
note from Ken asking that you and I have the first meeting and come back to 
him withrecommendations.  I agree with the agenda you have set out.  
It may also be worth discussing how we can use the individual  members of 
this group outside of the meetings with the  Enron Exec Committee: there may 
be efforts elsewhere in the company which would benefit from the advice and 
input of members of the group.

I believe that you agreed at our last meeting that it might be well for you 
and me -- and Ken if available -- to discuss plans for this group in 2001. My 
feeling is that we should review its composition after the election -- we may 
lose Larry or want to add a Democrat (Laura Tyson?); we can take a hard look 
at who is contributing and who isn't etc.
My agenda would be:
1. What can be done to increase the value to Enron? As I see it we have two 
purposes: to create fans of and spokepersons for the company in important 
fora, and to enrich management's understanding of the outside world (what it 
is like, and how it views some of the problems that Enron faces).
2. What are the likely topics that it would be valuable for Enron to discuss 
in 2001, as best we can judge things at this early point in time? 
3. What should the composition of the group consist of in 2001, given 
whatever we decide in #1 and #2 above.
4. How can we maximize the chance of achieving Ken's objective of attracting 
outside guest speakers? Advance scheduling? Fees? And what sorts would we 
like to attract?
I am sure there are many other items; these are designed merely to start you 
thinking.
Let me start the bidding by suggesting November 29 or December 4, inn 
Washington if you happen to be in town, in Houston if that is more convenient.

on Thurs., April 19.  He speaks at a conference sometime in the morning on 
Friday, April 20.   I plan on flying him back that afternoon (or if you go

Duke Energy Offers Governor Davis Solutions to California's Power Supply 
Shortfall 

     Committing to Deliver 3,000 Megawatts of New Supply to California
               And a Five-Year Fixed Price Supply Contract

    HOUSTON AND MOSS LANDING, Calif., July 31 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy
North America (DENA) today offered to California Governor Gray Davis specific
solutions to address the state's electricity supply shortage proposing to
deliver 3,000 megawatts of new supply through the construction of generation
facilities.  In addition, DENA proposed a five-year, fixed-price supply
contract to incumbent utilities to address the immediate concern with volatile
electricity prices.
    "California's high electricity prices during peak-demand periods result
from insufficient supply to meet the demand," said Jim Donnell, president and
chief executive officer of DENA.  "In the past ten years, no significant new
power generation facilities have been built in California.  During the same
period, peak demand has risen more than 10,000 megawatts.  This combination
has caused the state's reserve margin to fall to less than 2 percent, which
necessarily results in higher prices and abnormal volatility."
    Under current procedures, it takes in excess of four years to deliver new
power generation in California.  To add substantial incremental generating
capacity to California, DENA proposed Governor Davis use his existing
authority under the California Emergency Services Act to streamline the
permitting process to facilitate the rapid construction of environmentally
friendly generation by 2001.  DENA also asked the governor to use his current
authority to allow California utilities to enter into bilateral contracts with
energy providers, so they could better manage their exposure to high energy
prices.
    To help solve the state's supply shortfall, DENA said it remained
committed to adding substantial generation in California.  Within two months
and upon receiving final regulatory approvals, the company will begin
construction on 1,000 megawatts at its Moss Landing facility.  The expansion
of the current 1,478-megawatt facility will be in commercial operation by
summer 2002.  And, with an expedited permitting process, DENA could deploy its
available resources to construct an additional 500 megawatts for commercial
operation in 2001 and 1,500 megawatts for 2002.
    To address the concern associated with the high energy prices experienced
this year, DENA offered to provide up to 2,000 megawatts of electricity to the
incumbent utilities at $50 per megawatt-hour for a five-year period beginning
Sept. 1, 2000.  This would mitigate the exposure to price spikes, for a
reasonable time period during which additional generation resources can be
built.
    "DENA is committed to help bring electricity price stability for the
citizens of California through these proposals," Donnell said.  "We are
confident that our expertise in building and operating power generation
facilities can help resolve the supply crisis."
    Duke Energy North America (DENA), is a leading wholesale energy services

Most of West in the Same Power Jam as California
 Utilities: Other states ran their grids at fever pitches as populations 
swelled and few new energy sources were developed. Now, also facing 
blackouts, they want to tilt balance of power away from the Golden State and 
toward themselves.


By PETER G. GOSSELIN, Times Staff Writer


     WINTERSBURG, Ariz.--For more than a century, California ran a simple 
account with the rest of the West: It demanded and the West supplied, most 
especially water and power.
     But as the Western states have ballooned in the last decade--in no small 
part because of an outbound trek of Californians--this simple, supply-demand 
relationship has broken down.
     Fundamentally, the rest of the West has outgrown its electrical system 
just as California has its own. And it has done so in very much the same 
way--by adding too many people without enough new power or conservation.
     Indeed, statistics show that much of the rest of the West would have 
been on the verge of trouble even without California's help and may yet face 
the sort of rolling blackouts that have wreaked so much havoc in the Golden 
State.
     The booming Southwest has run its power grid at such a fever pitch that 
its planning reserves--the extra power that utilities build in to handle 
emergencies--have shrunk to levels that many regulators and industry experts 
consider dangerous.
     Almost none of the West save Montana has increased its power production 
at anything like the pace of its population growth during the last decade. 
Despite the long economic boom of the 1990s, which smiled especially on the 
West, several, such as Arizona, have failed to complete a single new power 
plant.
     "We don't know how bad it's going to be yet," said Utah's Republican 
governor, Mike Leavitt. "We won't know that until May, June, July and August, 
when everyone in the Southwest turns on their swamp coolers."
     In trying to dodge the blackout bullet, many Western leaders are seeking 
to force a great change on the region: to renegotiate their states' basic 
deal with California. They want to end an old relationship--that between 
center and hinterland, colonizer and colonized--and establish a new one that 
could curtail California's long regional dominance.
     In the strange chemistry of the moment--when a once-Republican state 
government has turned Democratic and a once-Democratic national government 
has turned Republican, when the battle is to a large extent over privately 
owned electricity rather than publicly controlled water--they could actually 
meet with some success.
     "California spent the 20th century decolonizing itself from Wall Street 
and the East," said Kevin Starr, the state librarian and author of a 
multivolume history of California. "Now, all of a sudden, there's a dramatic 
possibility of it being recolonized, at least in part, by the rest of the 
West."

     Captive Plants Feed Power to California
     Ground zero for these changes lies 50 miles west of Phoenix in the dry 
scrublands of Wintersburg. This is home to the Palo Verde nuclear facility, 
now the nation's single biggest power producer. It will soon be home as well 
to between three and six new gas-fired power plants that, combined, will 
produce even more electricity than their giant neighbor.
     Palo Verde represents a great deal about the old, fraying world of 
regulated utilities and about the supply-demand relationships that California 
once maintained with the rest of the West.
     More than one-quarter of the plant is owned by Los Angeles' municipal 
utility, the Department of Water and Power, several other California cities 
and Southern California Edison.
     A row of steel latticework towers runs off toward California, carrying a 
transmission line from plant to consumer. California has big stakes in a 
half-dozen similarly captive plants in an arc of states from Nevada to New 
Mexico.
     From California's point of view, the beauty of these projects has been 
that they provided near-certain power without the muss of meeting state 
pollution standards or the political hassle of building closer to home.
     And at least until the mid-1990s, California regulators virtually 
guaranteed that their owners covered their costs and made profits, even if 
plants' power wasn't immediately needed.
     "The first principle of the old system was that you had to be able to 
meet demand, no matter what," said Paul L. Joskow, a veteran utility 
economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
     "If you had too much power, if it cost you a little too much, that was 
less important than being sure you could meet demand." And, he added, "you 
had regulators watching to make sure you did."
     The gas-fired plants that are about to pop up in Wintersburg are also 
representative, but of the new, deregulated world of power production. 
Although they will crowd in around Palo Verde and tap into the same 
California transmission line, they are being built on an entirely different 
business premise: selling power to the highest bidder.
     In fact, the reason this empty patch of desert has become such an 
electricity hot spot lately is not Palo Verde itself, but its huge 
transmission lines. In addition to the California line, four others fan out 
from the plant: two back to Phoenix, one east to New Mexico, and one north to 
Utah and from there to the Northwest.
     All were built to hard-wire the nuclear project to its owners. But they 
are now seen as the means by which a new breed of producer can get top dollar 
by sending power wherever prices are highest.
     "It used to be generating capacity was built by people who looked at the 
market to see if they could meet demand," said Jack Davis, president of 
Pinnacle West Capital Corp., which owns Arizona's major utility and is 
putting up two of the Wintersburg plants.
     "Now," he said approvingly, "it's being built by people who look at the 
market to see if you can make a lot of money."

     Plans Go Awry in Many States
     Money, not the watchful eye of government, was what was supposed to 
assure that electricity deregulation worked. The opportunity to make it would 
cause investors to flock to the electricity business, ensuring that plenty of 
new power plants got built.
     If too many went up, it would be investors, not ratepayers, who 
suffered. If too few, then high prices would attract still more investors, 
more plants and, ultimately, more power.
     But to date, almost nothing about deregulation has gone as planned--and 
not just in California, but in the West in general.
     Take Arizona. The state has a hands-off attitude toward business, 
including its utilities. It has almost none of the environmental restrictions 
blamed for keeping California from putting up the new plants it needs.
     Its population grew by 40% from 1990 to 2000, according to the Census 
Bureau. And its demand for electricity expanded at nearly twice that rate, 
according to industry figures.
     "Arizona should have been a power producer's heaven," said A. Michael 
Schaal, a senior analyst with Energy Ventures Analysis Inc., a prominent 
Washington-area consulting firm.
     But Arizona's power production rose a mere 4% during the 1990s, mostly 
as a result of improving existing plants. Until 18 months ago, no one had 
applied to build a major power plant since Palo Verde in the late 1980s.
     "I guess I go on the assumption that the utilities plan with some sort 
of 10-, 20-, 30-year time horizon," Arizona's Republican Gov. Jane Dee Hull 
said in a recent interview. "I think what we all worry about is: Are they 
planning?"
     Or Nevada. Its utilities apparently did plan and increased 
electricity-making capacity between 1990 and 2000 by a substantial 44%. But 
that wasn't enough to keep up with the state's population, which increased 
66%. On Thursday, Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn, a Republican and former energy 
company executive, indefinitely halted deregulation in his state.
     Or traditionally energy-rich Washington state. One of its major 
utilities, Seattle City Light, recently learned that all of its previously 
planned supply increase for the next four years will be consumed, and then 
some, by just three new customers: computer server farms being built to 
handle the growing Internet traffic in and out of the high-tech capital.
     But it's unlikely to be able to get extra power soon because regional 
supplies are balanced on a "razor's edge," according to Northwest Power Pool 
President Jerry Rust. "We have no cushion."
     Indeed, the electricity supplies of the entire West are balanced on a 
razor's edge, with a variety of forecasters predicting serious shortages this 
summer.
     Schaal, the Washington-area consultant, for example, said the region 
will come up 6% short. "Westerners can expect 150 to 275 hours of rolling 
blackouts, most of them in California," he said.
     One of the most striking aspects of the current situation is that, in 
contrast to what most people think, supplies have not grown short just 
recently.
     They have been perilously tight for the last several years--before the 
start of California's troubles of this summer and fall, and before the 
near-record dry winter that has left the Northwest dangerously short of water 
for its hydroelectric dams.
     The implication is that California did not cause other states to run 
short of power so much as trigger events that exposed their danger. It did 
that, according to key observers, with one monumentally inept maneuver.
     When California required its major utilities to buy power in the 
volatile spot market and simultaneously prohibited them from passing along 
higher costs to consumers, it set off a furious price spiral.
     That effectively stripped the entire region of its energy security 
blanket, the assurance that it could buy extra power relatively inexpensively 
if local supplies proved inadequate.
     The result has been a string of crises across the West.
     In southern Arizona, for example, the San Carlos Irrigation Project, a 
tiny public utility that tried to jump into the deregulation vanguard by 
dropping long-term contracts in hopes of more power at lower prices in the 
spot market, has announced that its bills are going up 300%. Most of the 
project's 13,300 poor customers say they can't pay.
     In Phoenix, utility executives who had confidently said the state was 
rich with new power projects about to come on line have decided to pull two 
50-year-old steam plants out of mothballs and rent a pair of portable 
generators to reduce purchases from the expensive spot market.
     In Idaho, the big power company is appealing to potato farmers to skip 
planting and sell the electricity they would use running irrigation pumps 
back to the firm. Company executives figure the buyback will be cheaper than 
purchasing power on the open market--and the potato farmers are likely to do 
pretty well themselves.

     Deep Hostility in Rest of the West
     The subtle difference between California's triggering recent events and 
actually causing the region's crisis is largely lost in the current 
atmosphere of apprehension and upheaval. Although leaders of the rest of the 
West are scrupulously evenhanded in commenting to outsiders about their big 
neighbor, they are less guarded at home.
     The normally mild-mannered Leavitt, for example, was recently quoted as 
warning a Salt Lake City audience that "California, if given the chance, 
would put a shunt into our veins and bleed us pretty quickly." (In an 
interview, he denied having made the remark.)
     Such comments reflect an old and easily rekindled view among Westerners 
that their states are, in the words of historian Bernard DeVoto, "plundered 
provinces"--terrain that first Easterners and then Californians have 
regularly raided for minerals, water and, most recently, power.
     But this time, some Western leaders think they can change all this. "A 
lot of people see an opportunity to rewrite the fundamental relationship with 
California to their advantage," said Stanford historian Richard White.
     The attempts at rewriting are taking shape across the West.
     In the Northwest, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana are redoubling 
their efforts to take over the Bonneville Power Administration, the huge, 
federally controlled generating system on the Columbia and Snake rivers that 
is one of California's chief sources of summer electricity. 
     "The crisis has highlighted the danger that power generated in the 
region can be exported without the region's consent," Oregon Gov. John 
Kitzhaber said in an interview.
     In Arizona, state officials have gone from having no proposals for new 
power plants to being buried by them. Regulators recently approved the 
construction of 10 plants, including several around Palo Verde, and are 
considering another eight.
     Although they are requiring the plants to temporarily serve Arizona's 
needs first, the facilities will soon be able to sell their power for 
whatever prices they can command, an arrangement that could leave California 
just one among many bidders.
     (Federal officials are unlikely to get in the way: Gov. Hull is close to 
President Bush, who in turn has shown little interest in helping Democratic 
California.)
     Perhaps the most aggressive efforts at change are occurring in Utah, 
where Leavitt is trying something that could become California's worst 
nightmare--recalling power that Utah produces for the state.
     Los Angeles' DWP and several other California utilities own 
three-quarters of the huge, coal-fired Intermountain Power Project in 
west-central Utah, and have been drawing on it without incident for 15 years.
     But Utah officials recently unearthed a long-forgotten provision in 
their agreement with the plant's owners that gives them the right, with 
proper notice, to recall power for local use.
     The state has already notified Los Angeles that it is taking back 50 
megawatts of electricity capacity this summer and another 170 next summer, 
and it may be able to take back still more, according to plant general 
manager Reed Searle.
     Although the amounts are trivial--the Los Angeles utility either owns or 
has firm contracts for more than 7,000 megawatts of capacity--Leavitt said 
Utah will demand similar recall provisions in agreements for any new plants 
in the state, including a 500- to 750-megawatt facility that Los Angeles is 
negotiating to build.
     "California has chosen not to create its own power generation and has 
depended on us to do that," the Utah governor said. "That's fine and we're 
willing to do that.
     "But," he added, "there comes a point at which, if demand grows too 
large, we've got to hold some of this capacity back for ourselves, and for 
our children and grandchildren."
     If Utah and the rest of the West have reached that point, California 
could be in for a much bigger and more enduring shock than the one from which 
it now suffers.

Even though I'm a Bush/Cheney supporter, I had to pass this one along...



George Bush and Dick Cheney are enjoying a celebration dinner at a fancy 
Washington restaurant. Their waitress approaches their table tom take their 
order, and she is GORGEOUS.

She asks Cheney what he wants, and he replies,   "I'll have the heart-healthy 
salad."

"Very good, sir," she replies, and turning to Bush she asks,

"And what do you want, Mr. President?"

Bush answers, "How about a quickie?"

Taken aback, the waitress slaps him and says,   "I'm shocked and disappointed 
in you. I thought you were bringing in a new administration that was 
committed to high principles and  morality. I'm sorry I voted for you."

With that, the waitress departed in a huff. Cheney leans over to Bush,and 
says, "Mr. President, I believe that's pronounced 'quiche'

Pete,

I would like to weigh in on this, if you don't mind.  First of all,  I 
requested meetings with the audit and EHS folks to understand our procedures 
and our status.  So, no fair ranting at Don.  Secondly, your note brings to 
mind what I find the most troublesome about our process as it currently 
stands.  It is not now, nor will it be in the future the audit department's 
responsibility to ensure that corrective actions are taken as a result of the 
audit process.  It is the responsibility of the business leader and the 
business management.  So, follow up with the companies should have been a 
communication from you to the business unit head, not from Don to the 
business and Don to you.  

But, we are going to work all of this out and in the meantime, we aren't 
going to get crosswise with each other.  This is going to be an "open kimono" 
kind of place and no information is going to be managed away from me.  I will 
be staying on top of things and I will be involved with all of the support 
groups, with the business leaders and with the executive managment..  And, 
problems that are uncovered will be owned by all of us responsible for the 
business and the appropriate handling of those issues will be a matter of 
performance between the business and myself.

So, please, calm down and let's all get off on the right foot.  Enjoy your 
holiday, darn it!

Rebecca

Don - really - this kind of upsets me - I thought you were going to call me 
if we were having any problems - this report looks like crap and is not 
reflective of actual status - I know TGS has completed most of its 
outstanding items -  Does your team call and follow up with the individual 
companies - requesting a status report ?    If so give me the names of who 
called and who you talked to  and the date of the call.   What is the concern 
about Cuiaba - they got a 90 + score -  TGS and Centragas are in South 
America - not carribbean.   Why did you not list the scores ?     Really - I 
think this report and the handling of transmitting this information is 
completely different from my understanding of our understanding of how this 
is supposed to work.    You were going to follow up with the companies and 
let me know if there were any problems and I was going to go fix the problems 
-  Report says there are problems and the first I hear of it is when  you go 
and report to my bosses.   This does not begin to reflect the concepts we had 
discussed.

Guys, for your information and a heads up.  I am going to be visiting with 
Rebecca and Jim this afternoon on their support going forward on timely 
completion of action items as well as support that the audit program is 
mandatory not optional.  We have always had both of you guys support so no 
problem there.  David, you may want to talk to Stephen about IGL. and Pete 
you may want to look at Cuiaba.  If I can help, please let me know.

Thanks for the info on the California Energy Crisis!!!!

Message:

I would like to take the time to say "Thank You!" for the descriptive email 
on the
California crisis. It was very informative and it was also good to know what 
Enron's part
in all of this was. 

Just a quick "Thanks!" and also, I personally would like to see more 
informative
communications similar to this about Enron's role in various situations 
around the world. 

I think it's good for other people like me who do not have a thorough 
knowledge of the
energy markets in the world. to get these types of emails. They are very 
insightful and
give me knowledge on how the business runs.

I just noticed one minor error.  I think that you are trying to highlight 
that Terry Winter, the Chief Executive Officer of the ISO voted against the 
proposal.  In the text, you say the Chairman of the ISO.  There is no 
Chairman of the ISO.  There is a Chairman of the Board of the ISO -- Jan 
Smutney-Jones -- who has consistently voted against the price caps since 
June.  Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.

Subject: White House To Support FERC Action Today

According to this morning's Washington Post, the Bush Administration will 
support the expected FERC action today of extending the existing California 
price mitigation regime to 10 other Western states and to all days/all hours, 
not just during California emergencies (stages 1, 2 and 3).  This action 
comes only a day before FERC and other witnesses will  testify on the 
Feinstein/Smith price cap legislation before the Senate Energy Committee, 
Gov. Davis and FERC will  testify before the Senate Governmental Affairs 
Committee on Wednesday, and the House Financial Services Committee joins the 
fray with a hearing on the California energy situation on Wednesday.  The 
latter committee will probably base its jurisdiction over some aspect of 
energy policy on a number of factors, including its jurisdiction over 
presidential economic emergency powers.  The committee staff has in the past 
expressed interest in derivatives and other financial aspects of energy 
trading and markets.  We are checking now to quietly determine whether these 
issues will be on Wednesday's agenda.

I agree that we need to add our customer contacts to the list.  This gives 
them a great opportunity to look smart -- "we went to the market and got 
price protection".

On the messages we need to include Mark's top three:  1) price caps cause 
shortages (Rob Bradley: let's put some historical examples together)

Subject: Re: Price Cap Media--DRAFT  

I have a couple of suggestions on parts of the draft.

Media Action:
In addition to doing behind the scenes editorial board meetings and the like, 
I would suggest that we get our coalition lined up and ready to release 
statements for certain key events which are likely to occur over the next 
several weeks, such as:

1.  SDG&E's selection of the winning bid to their RFP.  Even if Enron isn't 
selected as the winning bid, the coalition should trumpet the market-based 
solution and the enormous market response to SDG&E's RFP.
2.  The Commission vote on UCAN's Emergency Motion.  We should be prepared to 
issue a statement whether the Cmmn votes with us or against us.  With us, the 
market can and did provide reasonable, expedient solutions to SDG&E's 
customers and protection from price spikes.  Against us, despite the 
overwhelming market response, the Cmmn chose to ignore the market solutions 
and impose more regulation.
3.  Potential for ARM members to surface a Provider of Last Resort proposal 
within the next couple of weeks.
4.  ISO Bd. Mtg-keep up pressure against reducing price caps.

Coalition Members:

Agree that those groups listed should be contacted, although the CMA, CRA, 
CIU, CLECA have been luke-warm in their advocacy.

I would add our customers (UC/CSU (especially the San Diego branch), PacTel, 
etc.)  NewEnergy has indicated that Kroger/Ralph's grocery stores, San 
Diego-based, would give testimonials.  I could solicit the members of ARM to 
identify a key customer contacts for interviews.  

We could check with our lobbyists and see who they would recommend (wine 
growers, dairy industry, etc.)  We should also consider the water agencies 
and the rural counties and the City of Pittsburg.  While the immediate 
message is responding to San Diego's situation, this latter group of 
potential coalition members would go to the larger message (keeping benefits 
of competitive markets) from a state-wide perspective.  What about the City 
of Pittsburg?

Here's a draft.  Given sense of urgency, I tried to develop a target for 
folks to shoot at rather than The Perfect One-pager.  So please fire at 
will.  In particular, need PR to fill in "Media Approaches" and "Key Message 
Points."

Steve, it is my understanding from Andre he will be retiring in early 
December.  Prior to his retirement, I would like to use Andre to assist Asset 
Operations in completing Crisis Management Simulation training at the TGS 
asset in Argentina in November and at the San Juan Gas and ProCaribe assets 
in Puerto Rico and the Ventane asset in Venezuela.  The Puerto Rico and 
Ventane simulations have yet to be scheduled but need to be completed prior 
to year end.

Asset Operations will outsource crisis simulation training commencing in 
January of 2000 but to complete this years objectives, Andre's assistance is 
necessary.
As has currently been the practice, Asset Operations will pick up the 
expenses for his time and efforts.

If you have questions, please advise.

Don

Subject: Economic Espionage Act Presentation - August 15th


You are cordially invited to attend a presentation entitled:  "Acquiring 
Information: Trade Secrets and the Economic Espionage Act (EEA)".   Daniel 
Waltz, of the law firm Patton Boggs LLP, is a leading expert on the EEA and 
will deliver what promises to be an interesting and informative segment.  
Congress passed the EEA in 1996, and it will increasingly shape how corporate 
America collects, uses, and protects valued information.  In addition to 
explaining some of the intricacies of the EEA, Dan Waltz will include 
"hypothetical" corporate case studies (some actually torn from the headlines) 
to illustrate his points.

This event is sponsored by ENA's Competitive Analysis and Business Controls 
(CABC) group and is supported by ENA legal.   This event kicks-off CABC's 
Competitive Intelligence Standards Program, which seeks to raise awareness of 
issues relevant both to Enron's practitioners and senior consumers of 
competitive intelligence.  This particular speaking engagement is designed to 
raise awareness of the EEA's legal guidelines, as well as to stimulate 
thought both on the collection opportunities against our competitors as well 
as how we might better protect Enron's own proprietary information.   I 
believe the topic of the EEA is especially relevant, given that we find 
ourselves amidst the big bang of this new information age.  

All CABC staff is being asked to attend this presentation, and we are 
inviting a small number of other Enron employees who are engaged in aspects 
of serious competitive intelligence.  Select executives like yourselves are 
being invited to attend, and I would welcome any suggestions of others that 
you think might benefit from attending this event.  

The EEA presentation is set for August 15, 1:30-3:00 PM, in the 50th floor 
Conference room.  Please RSVP to either myself or Sharon Purswell.  Hope to 
see you there.


 
P.S.  By the way, our next speaker segment in the CI Standards Program will 
concentrate on the guidelines and implications of the "Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act (FCPA)," and will likely be scheduled for the fall.

hire analysts during their orientation.  As a reminder, you are scheduled to 
speak over lunch on Monday, July 17 from 12:00 p.m. to 12:30 p.m. at the 
Doubletree Hotel in the LaSalle Ballroom.

Purpose of the luncheon:  Welcome the new hire analysts and impart to them 
our important this program is to Enron.

The analyst program is the ultimate pipeline of top entry-level talent, 
strategically deployed to meet anticipated business needs.  We look to this 
program to provide the company with our future business leader.
The program is a premier partner in providing exciting career challenges in 
areas of Finance, Origination/Structuring, Technology, Risk Management, Sales 
and Marketing, Trading, Valuation, and Accounting. 
The analyst program is also an avenue for providing the solid foundation of 
knowledge and skill needed in a competitive and dynamic global corporation.

that is always reinventing itself.  The opportunities are endless.


There will be 75 new hire analysts attending this orientation.  Other than 
the recruiting process, this is their first impression of Enron and Senior 
Management.  The first week of their orientation will consist of 
presentations given by all business units/operating companies.  Weeks two and 
three will consist of technical training (i.e., modeling, valuation, working 
styles, communicating effectively and computer training).  Additionally, we 
have social events scheduled to allow them to network with peers and 
management.  Additionally, I have attached a calendar of the orientation for 
your review.

Steve, let me know if you require additional information.  Thank you for your 
support in our new hire orientation efforts.

Regards,
Celeste Roberts

It is tenure at the level (eg vp or MD) not with organization.  The color 
scheme looks good.

all;
Attached are the screen shots to give you an idea how the red/green color 
coding for rating movement from mid year ratings will appear on the screen.  
Is this more of what you had in mind?   Let me know what you think.  G

Also, can you please confirm my understanding that the tenure color coding is 
TENURE AS A VP (AND MD?) and not tenure in the organization?

Subject: Talking Points re "reregulation" in California

As I promised this morning at the executive committee meeting, below are some 
talking points for your use.

Overall message:  the market is working, regulation is not.

In California, peak demand rose by 10% over the last 4 years while new 
capacity grew by only 2%.  But, as you would expect, the market responded by 
proposing 8,000MW of new generation - - more than enough to offset the peak 
demand growth.  The regulatory process, at both the state and local level, 
has failed to site this new generation.  The problem is regulation, not 
deregulation.

When San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices, 
Enron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego 
customers from price volatility and provided prices below their current 
summer levels (Enron's price was about $55/MWH).  After publication of 
Enron's offer, nine other companies made offers.  Again, the market responded 
where regulation failed.  San Diego has not accepted any of these offers 
because of regulatory/legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside 
of the PX (i.e. the spot market).

In markets where siting is easier, suppliers have moved to build additional 
generation.  Enron built 3 plants in response to the 1998 price spikes.  
Those plants were planned, sited and built in less that 12 months - - in time 
for the summer of 1999.  Where regulatory hurdles are lower, the market 
responds.

The solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition 
not reregulation.  Policy makers should:

Open the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it 
is needed.

Expedite interconnection of new generation.

Expedite siting of new facilities.

Give customers a choice, so that they have better access to demand side 
solutions.


Also attached is a more detailed discussion of California, prepared by Jeff 
Dasovich of our San Francisco office.

It's hard to formulate a position without more of the specifics, but I think 
our message should generally be:
We support providing immediate rate relief to small residential customers.  
We believe that relief is best provided by giving San Diego the ability to 
procure power on a fixed price basis from the market.  San Diego has offers 
in front of it now; those should be evaluated and the legislature and the 
commission should give San Diego the flexibility to accept one or more of 
them.  This is sounder than running huge deferrals (deficits) to be later 
recovered from consumers.
Rate relief should be accompanied by real reform.  Rate caps have bad long 
term consequences: they cause shortages.  Combining short-medium term rate 
relief with expedited siting of new facilities will address the near term 
problem while laying the proper groundwork for a long term solution.

Subject: Daily Update / Legislative Update - 8/23/00

This email reflects today's events in Sacramento. The information provided is 
subject to change because of constant flux. However it is important for us to 
provide this information for feedback and to caution as to new regulations 
that may affect some deals in the making .

Governor Davis, Assembly Women Susan Davis, and Senator Alpert had a press 
conference.

They will introduce a rate/bill stabilization plan for SDG&E and an 
expediting siting bill. There is no language as of yet. 

Although there is no specific language, the following elements may be 
included:

The stabilization plan will be applicable to residential and probably 
commercial customers in SDG&E
The bill cap may be set at $68 for residential.
The cap will be in place until the end of 2002
There will be language on expediting siting for generation plants  

Sam Wehn and Sandra McCubbin have been talking with the CEC executive 
director and several legislators about the siting portion of the bill. 

Any comments as to the bill cap proposal?

Subject: Update - Proposed Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes

Rick,

You will recall Steve Kean participated in a conference call on Nov 14 with 
John Lavorato et al to discuss emergency Pool Rule changes that the Power 
Pool intended to implement in two days.  We developed a 5 point action plan 
to deal with the proposed Power Pool rule changes that would have a 
significant impact on the value of Enron's PPA investment in Alberta.    
By way of update to Steve, you may wish to brief him that: 1) It appears the 
Power Pool will not proceed with the rule change designed to exclude 
importers from setting pool price.  They will proceed with dispatch risk rule 
changes but we have given input on those too and I am optimistic that Enron 
will be able to live with these rule changes, the final wording of which we 
should see on Monday, 2) We  have set up a meeting with the Minister of 
Resource Development (you, Rob Milnthorp and I will attend) on December 11 to 
encourage the Alberta Government to stay the course, and 3) This week we will 
finalize our "Lessons from other Jurisdictions" document (that Steve sent me 
materials to include in) and will provide it to the Alberta Government and 
Power Pool and then follow up with them.

Subject: Update - Proposed Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes

The attached memo provides an update on the status of the Power Pool's 
further consideration of the proposed rule changes.  In summary, it appears 
the Pool will not proceed with the proposal to exclude import offers from 
setting pool price but will recommend a rule that reduces ability of 
suppliers to become price takers on volumes that were originally priced too 
high to clear the merit order.  I will receive more specifics on the dispatch 
risk rule change on Monday.

Regards,

Rob

calendar.
Also, I would like you to set up a meeting with me, Cindy Olson, Beth Tilney, 
Kelly Kimberly, Mark koenig, Rick Causey, and Rick Buy.  I was thinking the 
easiest way to get us all together would be to get a room at a restaurant for 
6 or 6:30 some evening.  I have contacted Beth and Cindy already, so they 
know what it is about, and I will leave messages for the others.  I just need 
to check schedules for now.

Also,  I think it would be a good idea to have a get together after work once 
a month or so for the Public Affairs organization.  Nothing fancy . .  . 
Cadillac Bar or something similar. . .  spouses and significant others 
invited.  Talk it over with a couple of people in the group and let me know 
what you come up with.

Subject: Gas Controller's Association speaker (California Energy Crisis)

The Gas Controller's Association, of which I am the Assistant Secretary, is 
holding a meeting on April 19th at the Gulf South (Koch) Building.  We would 
like to present a speaker who can educate our members on the California 
Energy Crisis, and discuss/present any of the proposed solutions thereto.   
We would appreciate it if you could carve some time out of your very busy 
schedule.  If you are unable to make any commitments, could you recommend 
someone within the organization who would be as well-versed on the topic?

About our organization:

The mission statement of the GCA is to "create an environment that 
facilitates the exchange of current and practical information, while 
enhancing relationships and promoting goodwill between operating, scheduling, 
distribution, and others involved in the process of
moving natural gas."  In addition, the GCA provides scholarships to students 
who plan to obtain a degree in a field deemed to be 
"industry related" from local area high schools.

Thank you for your time,

Mary Poorman

Mark also forwarded a voicemail from Doty.  Doty goes into great length about 
his discussions with Gramm (both of them) and professes to have not only a 
good relationship but also the support of the Senator.  At this point, any 
reason not to get the letter prepared for Ken's signature?

Mark:  This is the article I mentioned in my voice mail.  For the record, I
have said early and often, that the inter-agency disputes among the
financial regulatory agencies (which the Administration of George H.W. Bush
inherited and did not create, by the way), are unacceptable and must be
avoided.  The Dems, of course, love to get this sort of thing going, as it
enables them to hold hearings on the need for further legislation to
re-regulate. The fact that this President's father came to the White House
in the denouement of a multi-billion dollar savings and loan crisis which he
did not create is also usually forgotten.

As I said in my voicemail and as the attached article confirms, I think
there is no substance to the rumor that Sen. Gramm would be opposed to my
nomination.  As one of the few who contributed generously to his own
Presidential Exploratory Committee in 1995-6, I think I stand in pretty well
with the Senator and we would work well together.  After our last meeting, I
think he would feel the same way.

Given the way the numbers came out, I guess we don't need the talking points, 
but we should still try to get to the bottom of this because we will be 
called on to comment to regulators and media.  Unless we have strong evidence 
to the contrary, it seems to me that wholesale markets are working .... they 
are open and they are competitive.  On the other hand, retail gas markets 
suffer from the same problems as electric markets ... they are not open, 
customers don't have effective choices and price signals don't get through, 
so there is no demand response when prices rise.  

On the points raised in the attachment, I'm still not sure I follow point 4.  
Also what does" electric disconnect" mean?

Leslie:  Looks good.  Just a couple of comments:

1. General
May want to point out that the roots of California's current gas woes are the 
same ones causing the electric problem---combined effect of California's 
"import-based" energy policy and the state's failure to invest in in-state 
infrastructure.  California imports about 25% of its electricity, but about 
80-90 percent of its gas supply.  California has failed to invest in the 
in-state infrastructure necessary to support increased gas demand over the 
last decade.  So we've got an interstate pipeline superhighway to the border 
and a dirt road of in-state transportation once you get into California.
The last bullet seems to suggest that manipulation may be taking place.  Can 
we support that suggestion, and is it one that we want to make necessarily?  
If we do suggest that manipulation may in part explain current prices, do we 
need to propose ways to eliminate it?  Otherwise, seems that we may be giving 
FERC ammunition to take action without trying to "steer" that action in the 
right direction.  Maybe I'm reading too much into the bullet.

2. Specific
Competition for gas coming to California has increased significantly.  The 
midwest (via Alliance) is competing away Canadian gas.  The Southwest 
(Nevada, Arizona) is competing away supply from the Southwest before it hits 
the California border.

I talked to Phil Cassidy.  The meeting dates cannot be moved, as you probably 
suspected.  I would suggest that we make calls to find out the availability 
of the congressional leaders given that they will likely be in recess.  
Gephardt has already declined.  Once we know their status, we may want to 
consider inviting key members of the Bush Cabinet.  We may want to also 
explore the availability of key Committee Chairs.  Phil also noted that we 
should consider having the President-elect during the evening program of Feb. 
21.  Let me know if you want us to handle next steps from DC.

Thanks -- I'm not on the VP PRC, but I will be in the group that reviews the 
results and does the MD ranking.  Hannon chairs the vp prc so you should make 
sure he has these too.  Also, Rick Shapiro is on the vp prc as are Scott 
Yeager, Steve Elliot and Ric DiMichele.

Also, I know you weren't thrilled with at least one outcome from Saturday's 
PRC.  If you want to talk about it or the process, give me a call.

Hi Steve--I don't know if you will be expected to represent me in the PRC, 
but I thought I'd send you my accomplishments in case you are.  Or for 
interesting reading anyway!

I'm looking forward to your discussion regarding the "reregulation threat" at 
the next meeting.  Below are some of my observations:

While it's premature to say we have an energy crisis, we are witnessing the 
triple threat of high summer gasoline prices, spiking electricity prices, and 
high natural gas prices for the upcoming heating season (I'll send along some 
of the data).
There is at least the potential for this to become a prominent national 
political issue:  Gore has focussed relentlessly on Bush's ties to "big oil" 
(which includes us by the way, though we produce nary a drop); and 
Congressional republicans have blamed the current administration for failing 
to have a coherent energy policy (though, at least so far, the dominant 
characteristic of the administration's policy has been a republicanesque 
reliance on the market).  
Notwithstanding the issue's potential to become political fodder and its 
prominence in the popular press, many Americans seem blissfully ignorant, at 
least on the electricity issue.  We did some focus group testing recently in 
Southern California -- a mere 15 minutes from the epicenter of the San Diego 
price quakes -- and most people knew nothing about it.  So, while the issue 
has the potential for political traction, it may not have caught on yet 
(except in places like San Diego and New York city.
The reaction in California has been to call for government intervention in 
electricity markets.  Investigations of out of state "price gougers and 
profiteers" have been undertaken and wholesale and retail price caps have 
been put in place.  They have not worked -- at least in wholesale markets.  
Suppliers are deciding to site plants elsewhere and when prices are high 
elsewhere in the West, power flows out of California to those other markets.  
Ironically, though I can't explain it in classical economic terms, the 
setting of rate caps in wholesale markets has had the effect of pulling 
prices up to the capped levels in offpeak times when there is more than 
enough supply.  For the most part, though, the caps and the other political 
reactions have been somewhat muted: policy makers have been reluctant to 
throw the deregulation plan out and start over, and the retail price caps 
have been relatively narrow ... so far.
Outside of California, the authors of other states' deregulation plans have 
distinguished their proposals from California's.  Regulators and legislators 
from such diverse places as Connecticut, Texas and Alberta have gone out of 
their way to defend their plans and explain why "California won't happen 
here."  For the most part, then, the reaction to California has been positive 
from Enron's perspective in states that have already deregulated.  There does 
remain some threat that aspects of the state plans (e.g. utility plant 
divestiture) may be postponed or cancelled.  The story is a bit more grim in 
states that were considering deregulation but have not gone forward with 
their plans:  I think it's off the agenda in most places.  The fact that most 
of the major markets (about 70% of total electric revenue) are already 
deregulated/deregulating is a blessing in that regard.
At the federal level there has been a combination of the "burn the village in 
order to save it" approach  -- allow some price caps to remove the pressure 
to reverse the whole deregulation program -- and a more positive call for 
comprehensive reform.
All in all, I believe we're OK so far and we need to look at this as an 
opportunity:  business is booming;  we sell protection from price volatility 
and the need for such protection is now plastered over the front pages of 
major newspapers.  On the public policy front we need to convert the 
controversy into productive action.  Our target has been FERC -- they are 
somewhat removed from the white hot rhetoric in California and they are a 
single commissioner's vote away from taking action to further open the 
market.
Enron's response:  Initially we hoped to feed information into industry 
groups and let them carry the message; our concern was that Enron -- a 
company which was in and out of the residential market in Cal. -- would not 
make the most attractive champion for the open market message.  We hoped that 
the new generators in Cal would take up the mantle.  It's fair to say that 
they fumbled the ball:  they are now locked in a pitched battle with the 
utilities over price caps and fall all to easily into the out of state 
profiteer label .... standing between Aunt Millie and rate relief.  They were 
also extremely slow out of the blocks with a more productive message.  We are 
now working the issue directly.  We are working the issue on a number of 
levels: 1) PR - we have good contacts in the press and have talked to 
numerous reporters and editorial writers.  As time goes on, the information 
and reporting has gotten somewhat better.  2)  Govt relations - we have been 
pushing for power plant siting legislation in California (the market wants to 
build capacity but the government won't let it).  This may be the best 
environment we'll ever see for streamlining the permitting process.  Also, in 
typical Enron fashion, we put a deal on the table.  We offered to sell power 
to the local utility at a price which would enable them to lock in stable 
rates for their customers at below current rates.  Our offer was followed by 
nine others and we tried to make something of the fact that the market was 
offering better solutions than California politicians.  SDG&E dropped the 
ball, unfortunately.  Instead of seizing the opportunity, they ended up going 
along with a government granted rate discount which will cause them to accrue 
a massive deferral account.  At the federal level we are contacting members, 
the DOE and FERC.  Here we are making a push for FERC action to finish 
"leveling the playing field" in wholesale markets so power can get from where 
it is to where its needed.  Additionally, we are developing a prepackaged 
system (including software) for nondiscriminatory open access (to take away 
any lingering excuses or delays).  3) Overall messaging -- we have been 
working with a well known political pollster to check our messages for their 
resonance at the grassroots level.  As we hone these messages we will be 
using them in the fora we are currently working.
Overall, we have more opportunity than risk in the current environment, but 
capitalizing on those opportunities continues to be a long shot.
An intersting rhetorical challenge for us is this:  much of the problem in 
power markets is blamed on high upstream fuel prices, particularly natural 
gas.  The gas market is open and structured pretty much the way we are 
advocating for electricity, so how can we maintain that the problem in power 
markets is an absence of open markets when the most open commodity market on 
the planet (natural gas) is producing such outsized prices?  The answer is 
somewhat complicated and therefore a bit unsatisfactory in the current 
debate:  gas prices are still lower in real terms than they were 
pre-deregulation;  long term prices are also lower than historical levels ( 
the curve is "backwardated" (sp?) meaning that prices in later years are 
lower than today so you can buy gas for 3 years at a price lower than current 
spot prices); and the economy is booming and driving up demand for basic 
inputs (this begs the question: why didn't the market react sooner and avoid 
the spike?).  When all else fails, a big part of the problem can be blamed on 
OPEC.  We haven't had this thrown at us yet, but we are trying to anticipate 
it and have answers at the ready.

 This is just the tip of the iceberg.  The issue is a great example of the 
intersection of our business interests with public policy debates and should 
promote a lively discussion when we get together.  Let me know if there is 
anything else you need.

this letter, Mr. Wu mentions that Dr. Kenneth Lay was a past recipient.

Well, you just called - so I won't complete this email!

I got a voicemail fro Ken.  He would be happy to meet with Freeman.  He is 
willing to work on other times, but suggested the following
After 3:00 on May 2nd (right after Ken's speech to the RGA) or late the day 
before or in the morning of the second (to do this though he would have to 
cancel his speech to the Texas Governor's business council but he is willing 
to do this if necessary)
His least preferred alternative in this general time frame would be early 
morning on the third.
Jeff -- could you coordinate with Rosie to get the time and place nailed down?

I am contacting you on the recommendation of Pug Winokur, who is on our Board 
of Directors.    Enron has formed an Advisory Council which consists of 
academicians, public policy thinkers and media, together with Enron 
executives.  I would like to invite you to address the group on E-Commerce 
issues at our next meeting  (Friday, September 8th in Houston).

Attached is a list of our Advisory Council members.




I think you will find this group interesting and thought provoking.

Please contact me at your earliest convenience at 713-853-1586.

1. Thank you for all your support on the Arena Proposition.
2. The following article reminded me to pass along a note about a PR/PA 
firm in California who Baselice & Associates worked with this year in 
passing Prop 35 (a contracting out initiative).  The firm is a full service 
firm named Woodward & McDowell.  They have been active in California 
legislative and initiative battles for some 20 years and I highly recommend 
them if Enron is in search of support with the electric deregulation fight 
out there.  Dick Woodward or Dave Fogarty can be reached at 650-340-0470.

If you have any questions, please call.

Calif Regulators,Grid Oper In Turf War Over Generation By JASON LEOPOLD Of 
DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES-California's electricity regulators and 
power-grid operator are locked in a turf war over who has the authority to 
order new power plant construction next summer to ensure the state has 
enough juice on hand when demand soars.
The California Public Utilities Commission says it can bring emergency 
power on line at a fraction of the cost that the Independent System 
Operator is expected to pay independent power producers for the same 
service.
Under it's plan, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co., Edison 
International's (EIX) Southern California Edison unit and Sempra Energy's 
(SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric Co. were ordered to submit documents by the 
end of November stating whether they can build and operate "peaking" plants 
by June 1.
The utilities weren't immediately available to comment.
On the other hand, the ISO - which is on the verge of signing contracts for 
440 peaking units with between 20 and 91 megawatts of electricity - says 
the commission's meddling could endanger any chance of additional resources 
coming on line in time.
"Any further interference on the state level could destroy the plan 
altogether," said an ISO source close to the issue. "There is no guarantee 
the utilities will be able to pull this off by next summer. And if the 
whole project is scrapped, you can expect there will be blackouts."
Interference by federal regulators has already cost the ISO two 
participants and nearly 600 megawatts in its peaking program.
Calpine Corp. (CPN) and Enron (ENE) initially agreed to build peaking 
plants for the ISO next summer, but withdrew their offers after the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission proposed capping the clearing price for 
California's wholesale electricity market at $150 a megawatt-hour.
The ISO, which operates one of the state's wholesale power markets and 
manages most of the high-voltage transmission grid, has already solicited 
and received bids from merchant generators for 1,800 megawatts of new 
peaking power for next summer.
Burned by the summer's power crisis and facing an 8,000-MW shortfall next 
summer, the ISO put out a request for bids in August. The ISO's board voted 
Oct. 30 to enter into the contracts, which it estimated would cost about 
$250 million a year for three years.
The state's Electricity Oversight Board, which oversees the performance of 
the ISO, and the Public Utilities Commission protested the decision on the 
grounds that the contracts were too expensive.
The commission is also questioning whether there is even a need for peaking 
power next summer and, if there is, whether the ISO should handle the 
solicitation.
"The question also arises as to whether the ISO - which is empowered only 
to operate the state's transmission system and which does not represent the 
state or its consumers - is the appropriate organization to plan, solicit 
and pay for the construction of new power plants across the state," the 
commission wrote in its Nov. 2 order.
Ind the end, the decision is up to state regulators. If utilities can come 
up with a cheaper alternative and if the regulators determine that 
additional generation is needed by next summer, then they will follow 
through with the utilities proposal.

Thanks.  I was glad to do it and would do it again... next time my computer 
will work.
I benefitted a great deal from what I heard from the group, especially

Steve . . . 

FYI -- we conducted a post-event survey on opinions about the HR employee 
meeting held last month and the HR management team thought you should know 
that participants rated your presentation very high.

When asked what should be kept the same next time, participants commented as 
follows about your presentation:
"I think a presentation from Corporate HR is of great value."
"Keep the presentations by the officers . . . to talk about the business."
"I liked having other people from ETS/Enron there to better understand the 
big picture and where Enron is going."
"Continue to bring in invited guests to keep the group apprised of Corporate 
activities. I liked the opportunity to hear both Stan and Steve--the field 
staff don't get as many opportunities to hear from corporate management."
"Visits by Steve Kean and Stan Horton. Their perspectives are very good . . ."

Clearly, your participation provided much value to the group and we 
appreciate very much your taking the time to come meet with us and share 
information. 

You should expect that we'll be asking you to come back again!

Regards, - Roger

What does this proposal imply about transmission pricing.  We have debated 
from time-to-time whether we would be better off with a pure "loads pay" 
transmission pricing scheme because it would leave fewer places for utilities 
to hide the ball (when they pay for transmission they are just transferring 
money from one pocket to the other) and it would allow us to reach the 
maximum number of counterparties for each MW (thereby increasing liquidity).  
Where do we stand?

These questsions seem to be focus on the modularity of the product.  This is 
fine from the vendors' perspectives, however, from a Tariff perspective, it 
hints at conceding to others' tariiffs/structures.  There should be a few 
questions that paint the entire Real Flow solution - even referencing that a 
tariff is available.

Also, can I assume the entities listed are endorsing eTransMart?  Or do they 
not even know their name is referenced here?

It looks like we are playing a smaller role than the WSJ article indicates -- 
i.e. a role commensurate with our level of interest.  I have talked with John 
several times about the relative importance of OPIC, ExIm and other funding 
organizations in light of the change in emphasis in our business.  As a 
result of those discussions we cut headcount and expenditures from the 
proposed budget for "01 and John has joined Linda Robertson's organization in 
the DC office (instead of being a stand alone effort).  Having said that, my 
view (based on the work John has been doing) is that we continue to have a 
considerable amount of work for him to do on the project finance front as a 
result of existing projects, projects we continue to pursue, and transfer 
issues associated with the asset sales.  Do you agree?

 This is not a battle to fight with OMB, but we have to show the agencies 
that we are supportive of  their programs and their budgets.  We are not 
going to lead the battle and in fact have not particpated in meetings on the 
hill.  But we are in negotiations with both EXIM and OPIC on Electrobolt and 
will need their support on our problem projects.  Also, Rebecca McDonald is 
on EXIM's private sector advisory committee.  If you need more lets talk.

Exporters Rush to Ex-Im Bank's Defense --- Lobby Campaign to Prevent Budget 
Cuts Seeks Help Of 100,000 Small Firms

WASHINGTON -- Angry and confused that a Republican administration has 
targeted one of their favorite programs for big cuts, America's largest 
exporters are appealing for help from lawmakers. 
Boeing Co., Caterpillar Inc., Enron Corp., Halliburton Co. and others are 
launching an aggressive lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill to protect the 
Export-Import Bank from budget reductions; the White House labels the Ex-Im 
Bank as corporate welfare.
"The administration has fired its shot, and now we're firing ours," said 
Edmund B. Rice, president of the Coalition for Employment Through Exports, an 
industry group that is leading the effort. 
Since they got wind of the proposed cuts a few weeks ago, business lobbyists 
have been trying to rally sympathetic lawmakers. And executives at Boeing, 
Caterpillar and other big companies plan to contact some 100,000 smaller 
suppliers that benefit indirectly from the $12.6 billion of export loans, 
guarantees and insurance that Ex-Im Bank provided in the last fiscal year. 
Those small companies, the executives hope, will create a groundswell of 
support in Congress for the Ex-Im Bank. 
"Companies large and small who have similar interests here are banding 
together to provide an educational effort so people understand the impact of 
this," said Chris Hansen, Boeing senior vice president for government 
relations. 
Corporate lobbyists also have dug up a speech that Vice President Dick 
Cheney, while chief executive of Halliburton, gave in 1997 praising the bank 
and scoffing at those who consider it a giveaway to big business. They plan 
to pass Mr. Cheney's comments to influential members of Congress this week. 
"We'll be circulating them very broadly," Mr. Rice said. 
A spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney had no immediate comment. 
Ex-Im Bank officials aren't talking publicly, avoiding the appearance that 
they are battling the White House to overturn the proposed 25% cut in the 
bank's $865 million operating budget for the current fiscal year, which ends 
Sept. 30. But an Ex-Im official said the topic has come up in conversations 
between key lawmakers and Ex-Im Bank Chairman James A. Harmon, who is soon to 
be succeeded by Mel Sembler, a Bush campaign fund-raiser and a 
shopping-center developer. 
At first, business lobbyists assumed administration budgeteers were just 
looking for savings anywhere they could find it. Before President Bush 
released his spending plan last week, companies appealed to Mitchell Daniels, 
head of the White House budget office, in an attempt to keep the Ex-Im Bank 
cuts out of the final proposal. 
The Ex-Im Bank's corporate clients include some of the country's largest 
political contributors. Boeing, the bank's largest user, received $3.3 
billion of financing last year. The Seattle aerospace company and its 
employees contributed $1.8 million to politicians and parties during the 2000 
election cycle, 61% to Republicans, according to federal election data 
assembled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Caterpillar, a Peoria, Ill., 
maker of engines and heavy equipment that secured seven Ex-Im Bank deals last 
year, and its employees contributed more than $500,000 -- 96% to Republicans. 
Company officials deny they wanted to leverage donations to try to secure 
political support for the Ex-Im Bank. 
Many lobbyists have come to the conclusion that administration officials -- 
those of a libertarian persuasion -- oppose Ex-Im Bank as a form of welfare 
for corporations. Indeed, the White House budget plan criticized the bank's 
operations as unjustified public subsidies for companies. "That makes it a 
much more serious issue," Mr. Rice said. "We're concerned that the 
administration seems to be turning its attention in this direction." 
Barring intervention from Mr. Cheney, business groups now have largely given 
up hope of convincing the White House to back down, planning instead to use 
their muscle to convince Congress to restore the Ex-Im Bank's funding. Bank 
officials and U.S. companies argue that, far from being a subsidy, the bank 
simply allows American companies to compete with European and Japanese firms 
that receive assistance from their own governments. 
"In many markets in Asia and Africa, the bank is absolutely critical to our 
ability to sell American-made products," said Bill Lane, Caterpillar's 
Washington director for governmental affairs.

[What's Brewing in the Real Estate Market] 
No Problem, Houston 
CENTURY DEVELOPMENT is about to announce plans to break ground on downtown 
Houston's third major office development in less than three years. In another 
sign of the strength of the city's energy sector, Century is finalizing a 
headquarters deal with Reliant Resources Inc. to take more than two-thirds of 
the project's 850,000 square feet, says Edwin Murphy, a Century senior vice 
president. 
Two other towers also are underway. In 1999, Hines began building a 1.2 
million square-foot tower for Enron Corp. and late last year Crescent Real 
Estate Equities broke ground on a 27-story tower that will be anchored by 
Ernst & Young. These three projects are the first major downtown office 
projects to get underway since 1986. 
The surge is part of a renaissance of downtown Houston, where new sports 
facilities, hotels, apartment buildings and restaurants have been mushrooming 
in recent years. "The new amenities have kept people from leaving and enticed 
people to come back," says Michael Hassler, of CB Richard Ellis.

Dutch Gas Competition Grows Despite Sluggish Reforms
By Germana Canzi
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

03/07/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- The Netherlands is emerging as an important testing 
ground for E.U. gas liberalization, as new trading hubs for competitive, 
short-term gas supplies from the U.K. and Norway emerge on the Belgian and 
German borders. 
However, much remains to be done. A group of large energy users and traders 
is preparing to confront Gasunie Thursday in a hearing organized by the 
regulator. The main issues of contention are the balancing system, which 
Gasunie conducts on an hourly basis, the extent to which transport tariffs 
are cost-focused and third-party access to storage facilities.
The emergence of competition in the Dutch gas sector is mostly due to the 
initiative of new market entrants who, despite a difficult regulatory 
environment, have managed to develop a market for short-term gas virtually 
from scratch. 
If liquidity improves in these emerging hubs, the Netherlands could become an 
important transit country for freely tradeable gas supplies to other 
countries in northwest Europe, as well as being an important market in its 
own right. However, the difficulty of implementing transparent third-party 
access systems in the Netherlands and in neighboring Germany casts a dark 
cloud over recent progress in competition. 
Since December, Enron Europe Ltd. (U.ENE), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), E.On AG 
(EON), RWE AG (G.RWE) and Electrabel SA (B.ELE) have been actively buying and 
selling gas, sourced in the U.K., the Netherlands and Norway, in a number of 
hubs between Emden in Germany and Emshaven and Oude Statenzijl in the 
Netherlands. 
David Gallagher, head of European gas trading at Enron in London, estimates 
that at least one trade a day of around 100,000 therms for a quarterly 
contract is done at the Oude Statenzijl hub, where the Gasunie pipeline 
system connects to the network of Wingas GmbH. 
An important element kick-starting short-term trading was the sale, in 
December 2000, of a 2 billion cubic meter a year Norwegian gas supply 
contract to five Dutch-based power generators. 
Robert van der Hoeven, head of fuel procurement at Electrabel, the owner of 
Dutch generator EPON, said his company uses most of the gas it imports from 
Norway for its plants in the Netherlands and trades the rest on a short-term 
basis in the Oude-Emden area. This pattern is common to the other Dutch-based 
parties to that contract. 
Trading in Dutch hubs received a further boost when Nederlandse Gasunie NV 
(N.NEG) decided, after months of wrangling with regulator DTe, to lower its 
transport tariffs by 6.5% from January 2001 and to unbundle its combined 
commodity and service tariff, the so-called CSS system, from July 2001. 
Gasunie now claims its pipeline system is fully open and transparent. To 
prove this, it says it has lost 30% of its customers in the eligible market, 
but that figure hasn't changed much since March 2000. Small wonder that 
critics say the switching figure doesn't necessarily indicate an ideal system 
of third-party access. 
According to energy consultants The Brattle Group, around half of the gas 
used by alternative suppliers goes through the 1 bcm/year Zebra pipeline from 
Zelzate to Zeeland, which was built by Dutch utilities a few years ago 
precisely because Gasunie refused to provide access on favorable terms. 
Shippers have complained that the hourly system used by Gasunie to balance 
the pipeline system raises the overall cost of shipping through its network 
significantly. Gasunie imposes a balancing charge which effectively forces 
shippers to pay for the extra gas brought into the system from storage sites, 
in addition to the capacity and transmission price. Critics say Gasunie has 
so far failed to unbundle these charges, although it agreed to do so in 
January. 
According to the Brattle Group, another controversial aspect of Gasunie's 
tariff system is that it is based on theoretical costs of constructing new 
pipelines rather than its actual costs. 
The DTe is also considering ways of reforming the storage system to make it 
competitive. BP PLC (U.BP) and Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij NV operate 
storage facilities and lease capacity to Gasunie through long-term contracts. 
The regulator is studying ways of allowing third parties access to storage 
facilities. Gasunie has so far shown little sign of negotiating more 
competitive tariffs with storage operators and passing on the benefits to 
customers, critics say. 
The growth of short-term trading in the Dutch gas market is also inevitably 
linked to its potential as a transit country for gas coming from the 
U.K.-Belgium gas interconnector and going towards the 82bcm-a-year German 
market. 
Market participants say liquidity at the Emden and Oude hubs has grown 
considerably since E.On and RWE started trading there earlier this year. 
However, the obstructive attitude of incumbents toward third-party access 
there has meant that so far most gas traded in the Netherlands has remained 
there.

WASHINGTON -- Angry and confused that a Republican administration has

Deal with state could take until 2002 to close

Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

LOS ANGELES (AP) - A tentative deal aimed at rescuing Southern California 
Edison from insolvency might not close in time to prevent the utility from 
begging creditors for more patience, Edison officials said Tuesday. 
The utility's tentative, $2.7 billion agreement to sell its power lines to 
the state could take until 2002 to be consummated, thanks to complicated 
legal issues and other paperwork, an Edison official told bondholders Tuesday.
Once the deal is signed, Edison will try to borrow against the promised cash, 
but Edison International Chief Financial Officer Ted Craver admitted the 
utility might have to ask creditors to simply wait for their money until it 
has the $2.7 billion in hand. 
Energy suppliers owed money by Edison did not immediately return calls for 
comment Tuesday. 
At least four groups of suppliers have sued Edison for millions in unpaid 
bills going back months. Edison and fellow utility Pacific Gas & Electric 
have said they have lost $13 billion on the open power market thanks to 
soaring prices paired with state-imposed price caps. 
PG&E's parent company was able to recently borrow $1 billion to pay its 
stockholders and its debuts. It did not use any of that money to pay PG&E's 
bills. 
Edison's disclosure, meanwhile, shocked state officials. 
Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, initially declined to comment 
on the status of the Edison deal, but eventually said, regarding its closure, 
"We're optimistic it will be sooner rather than later." 
The pacing would have nothing to do with whether fellow utilities Sempra 
Energy and PG&E also sell their transmission lines to California, Craver 
said. 
Among the things that could delay the deal's closing is Edison's need to find 
landowners on whose property its lines were built to assure no legal 
agreements are being violated by the sale. Edison would also have to pin down 
exactly what it would be selling to the state - terms that might not be 
decided until after a deal has been inked, Craver said. 
"Trust me," Craver said in a phone call after the conference. "There are a 
lot of legal-type documents - stuff that you and I ... would think of as a 
bloody nightmare." 
The disclosure comes at a time when an increasing number of power suppliers 
are suing the utility for millions in unpaid bills. 
Edison also disclosed Tuesday that two more lawsuits had landed in its lap - 
one by a group of wind-powered generators including Enron Wind, the other by 
two suppliers including New York-based Caithness Energy. 
Both suits were filed during the past five days, Edison Assistant General 
Counsel Barbara Reeves said. It was not immediately clear how much the 
complainants were seeking; neither Enron nor Caithness returned calls for 
comment. 
The two filings bring the total number of suits by renewable-energy suppliers 
against Edison to four, the utility said. The city of Long Beach and 
CalEnergy Operating Group, a geothermal supplier, have also sued for back 
payments. 
CalEnergy alone has said it is owed $45 million in November and December 
payments. 
The line sale, part of a multifaceted, tentative deal with the state that 
could save Edison from insolvency, could take anywhere from several months 
into next year, Craver said. 
The tentative deal, announced by Gov. Gray Davis Feb. 23, calls for the state 
to pay more than twice the book value for Edison's lines. 
It also would require Edison to sell cheap power to the state for a decade 
and for Edison to end its lawsuit against state regulators. The suit asserts 
that price caps imposed by the California Public Utilities Commission are 
illegal under federal law. 
Additionally, Edison's parent would have to return $420 million it collected 
from the utility over the past several years. The money was used to pay debt, 
buy back stock and pay dividends to investors. 
SCE, PG&E and Sempra have complained they are near bankruptcy because of 
soaring prices on the open market combined with the state-imposed price caps 
for consumers. 
Sempra and PG&E have yet to announce similar line-sale deals with the state, 
though they and the governor have said negotiations are ongoing. The total 
cost of the 26,000 miles of lines has been estimated at $4.5 billion to $7 
billion.

Sierra Pacific CEO Doubts SEC OK Of Enron Unit Buy-Report

03/06/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Sierra Pacific Resources (SRP) CEO Walter Higgins 
said in an interview last week that he doubts the company's $3.1 billion 
acquisition of Enron Corp.'s (ENE) utility Portland General Electric will be 
approved by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the Las Vegas Sun 
reported Tuesday. 
The SEC must find that Sierra Pacific is in a strong financial position 
before it will approve the deal, but the company is currently weakened by 
having lost millions of dollars in fuel and purchased power costs, Higgins 
said in the report.
A $311 million rate increase to cover those costs began March 1, but Higgins 
said that money would only pay back those expenses and wouldn't improve the 
company's stability to a level the SEC would find adequate, according to the 
report. 
The Public Utilities Commission can halt the rate hike and order refunds if 
it decides the hike isn't necessary. The PUC is holding hearings to determine 
the prudency of the hike, and members of the state's powerful casino and 
mining industries have filed to intervene. 
Sierra Pacific's plan to shore up its financial position through the sale of 
its 10 power plants, worth nearly $2 billion, may also be in jeopardy. The 
state Senate is considering a bill to block the sales, and Nevada Gov. Kenny 
Guinn recently sent a letter to the PUC asking that it reconsider its order 
allowing electric utilities to sell assets. 
Financial analysts have said that not allowing Sierra Pacific's two utilities 
to sell their assets would have a ripple effect on the company's financial 
position. The asset sales are tied to low-priced power contracts, and if the 
sales are canceled, the low-priced power will be gone as well. 
"If the divestiture is stopped...the state may be dealing with a much bigger 
rate increase," Steve Fleishman, Merrill Lynch utility analyst, told Dow 
Jones Newswires recently. 
Sierra Pacific is the parent company of electric utilities Sierra Pacific 
Power Co. and Nevada Power, which serve customers in the state's North and 
South, respectively.

Many Power Deals Announced by California Governor Still Not Final
By Jason Leopold

03/06/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Dow Jones Newswires 
LOS ANGELES -- Many of the long-term power-supply contracts announced by 
California Gov. Gray Davis this week remain under negotiation or are the 
subject of ongoing lawsuits, power suppliers said Tuesday.
The lack of finality to the deals raises questions about the state's success 
in covering its power needs, particularly going into what is expected to be 
an unusually tight summer. 
Generators said privately they were surprised the governor went ahead with 
his announcement Monday, given that many of the contracts haven't been 
signed. 
David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power, who negotiated the contracts on behalf of the state, conceded that 
details remain to be worked out. "This is not a done deal," Mr. Freeman said, 
adding that credit concerns are keeping generators from signing the deals. 
Gov. Davis announced Monday that California has secured 40 long-term 
contracts that will provide California with about 629 million megawatt hours 
of electricity over 10 years, at a price of more than $40 billion. A megawatt 
hour is roughly the amount of electricity needed to power 1,000 homes. 
Several of those forward deals, however, involve contracts originally held by 
Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp. 
(PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric at the California Power Exchange, 
previously the state's main power market. 
The governor seized those contracts earlier this year, just before the Power 
Exchange liquidated them to cover hundreds of millions of dollars in power 
bills the utilities had failed to pay. 
The contracts, which total about 1.3 million megawatt hours of electricity 
and have a market value of about $1 billion, according to market sources, 
have yet to be paid for or signed over to the state. Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), 
one of the suppliers that sold the contracts to Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed, has 
sued Gov. Davis for unlawfully commandeering those contracts. 
Although Duke has reached an interim settlement to continue providing power 
to the state Department of Water Resources until April 30, the company and 
the Davis administration still have to "develop a comprehensive long-term 
settlement to pay for the power supply contracts," said Duke spokesman Tom 
Williams. 
The governor went ahead with the announcement, because the California 
Department of Water Resources believes it will be able to finalize and sign 
the contracts over the next several weeks, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio 
said. 
Separately, several suppliers named in the governor's announcement Monday -- 
including Duke, Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Mirant Corp. (MIR), Sempra Energy, 
Enron Corp. (ENE) and Avista Corp. (AVA) -- said they have yet to sign final 
agreements with the state, although negotiations were ongoing. 
"We are working in good faith with the DWR toward a long-term contract," said 
Art Larson, spokesman for Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra. Mr. 
Larson said Sempra signed a terms of agreement with the water-resources 
department and expects to reach a final agreement over the next several 
weeks. 
Reliant said it has only signed a short-term contract with the state that 
expires in about two weeks. The company will only sign a long-term contract 
once it's paid more than $400 million owed by Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed, 
spokesman Richard Wheatley said. 
Mirant said it also won't sign contracts with the state until it's paid. 
Enron said it's reached agreement on terms with the state, but has some 
credit-related details to hammer out. "Everything's been agreed to except for 
some credit technicalities," Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. 
Meanwhile, small, independent power plants in California that are capable of 
generating 1,800 megawatts of power are shut down because their owners 
haven't been paid by the state's two main utilities, the California 
Independent System Operator said Tuesday. 
The decline in small-plant output has contributed to the state's power-supply 
problems the past two months. Partnerships involving El Paso Corp. (EPG), for 
example, shut down 350 megawatts of generation last weekend due to 
nonpayment, the company said Tuesday. 
SoCal Ed hasn't paid the owners of the smaller generators, known as 
"qualifying facilities," since early December, which means the generators are 
still owed for electric production in October, while PG&E has paid only a 
small percentage of its qualifying facility bills since its last full payment 
in early January. 
The plants, one-third of which are powered by renewable sources like wind and 
solar power, meet almost 30% of California's electricity needs. Almost all of 
the closed generators are fueled by natural gas, and many haven't been able 
to pay their gas suppliers and have been cut off from their gas supply. 
The California Senate Energy Committee plans to vote on legislation to create 
a new pricing system for all qualifying facilities this week. The proposed 
bill would cut the prices to qualifying facilities from about 17 cents a 
kilowatt-hour the past eight months to about eight cents, depending on the 
price of five-year natural-gas contracts the generators can sign. The plants 
that run on renewable resources would be paid 5.4 cents a kilowatt-hour.

US Natural Gas Prices Fall As Demand Slips In Most Areas

03/06/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. natural gas physical prices fell Tuesday as demand 
eased, except in the Northeast and Southeast areas of the country, traders 
said. 
Heavy snowstorms in the upper Northeast supported some pricing, as did cooler 
weather in Georgia, the Carolinas and the Florida panhandle.
Some storage buying occurred in Texas "if they could make it work," a trader 
said. 
"It was a pretty uneventful day," a Gulf Coast trader said late Tuesday. 
Also, because of the snowstorm in the Northeast, traders had purchased gas 
ahead of time to make up for needed load, he said. 
A scheduled work outage on Enron's Transwestern San Juan lateral in New 
Mexico was completed, and the return of a power plant in California 
alleviated demand in the West, traders said. 
At the Arizona-California border hub, buyers paid around $13-$33 a million 
British thermal units, West Coast traders said, down as much as $15 from 
Monday. 
At PG&E Citygate, prices were mixed, with buyers paying $9.75-$10.65/MMBtu, 
down 25 cents on the bid, up 15 cents on the offer. 
In the Midwest, Chicago Citygate prices fell 7 cents-8 cents to a range of 
$5.42-$5.53/MMBtu. Alliance Pipeline into Chicago traded around 
$5.47-$5.52/MMBtu, down 4 cents to 9 cents from Monday. 
The Nymex April natural gas futures contract settled at $5.315/MMBtu, down 
2.1 cents in a tight, range-bound, uneventful session that started late due 
to bad weather. 
Physical gas prices at the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana ended in a 
range of $5.25-$5.30/MMBtu, down 2 cents-6 cents from Monday. 
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line at Station 65 deals were made in a similar 
range of $5.26-$5.35/MMBtu, down 2 cents on the bid, unchanged on the offer. 
At Katy in East Texas, buyers paid $5.21-$5.30/MMBtu, down 5 cents-6 cents. 
At Waha, prices fell 9 cents-12 cents to a range of $5.15-$5.30/MMBtu.

I would like to exchange ideas on topics for the upcoming Enron Advisory 
Council meeting.  The discussion you led last time was particularly thought 
provoking and I'd like to extend an open-ended invitation for you to take the 
floor again on a topic of your choice.

We will have presentations from Gavyn Davies and Larry Lindsay on 
macroeconomic trends as well as the customary domestic political update from 
Bill Kristol.  The balance of the meeting will focus on markets which are, or 
could be, commoditized.  We will update the Council on new markets we've 
added to the Enron portfolio through Enron Networks, (most recently metals 
and paper).  A presentation by you on this, or another trend, would be most 
welcome.

Let me know what you think.

Andy -

Thanks again for allowing me to participate in this afternoon's discussion.
As I mentioned, I believe discussions of transmission issues must include
both jurisdictional and RTO.  I understand that the RTO discussion is more
difficult in the absence of paper.  For that reason, I have taken the
liberty of drafting language that I believe mirrors (at least my view) of
one possible construct of RTO Proposal I.

I hope you find this helpful.  I will bring copies to our meeting tomorrow.

		 Subject: Fiber Optic Public Lands Right-of-Way Status

The fat lady hasn't quite sung yet, but I thought it would be a good idea to 
give you a readout on the current status of the BLM/USFS fiber optic 
right-of-way issue.

In a nutshell, our strategy seems to have worked and we've won all the 
concessions we sought.  As you'll recall these were:

a) to get the BLM to withdraw any "interim" policies, the first of which 
split fiber cables into 144 different ROW certifications, and a later version 
that re-packaged the issue, mandating that ROW certificates be issued each 
time a fiber owner subleases or sells capacity on its line, with a 
retroactivity clause that added extra sting;
b) to get the Forest Service to retract its May 2nd memorandum which changed 
its fiber optic ROW policy from published fee schedules to individual 
"comparable" assessments (the first such assessment, which compared ROW fees 
in urban centers in downtown Portland and Seattle to Oregon forest lands, 
increased the cost of a segment of our FTV fiber build 150 fold);
c) to block both agencies from implementing any proposed or final rule in FY 
2001; and
d) to create an open rule making process that involves all interested 
stakeholders, including Enron.

Thanks to the considerable pressure we orchestrated from Congress and the 
Administration, BLM Director Fry and USFS Chief Dombeck have backed away from 
points a and b above, and have agreed to points c and d.   The language we 
inserted in the Interior Appropriations Bill, which has been agreed to by the 
Conferees, forces both agencies to revert back to the published fee 
schedules, prevents them from implementing any new policies in FY 2001, and 
forces them to work with industry and to come up with a common policy for 
future rent determination.

The reference in the opening sentence to gravitationally-challenged women is 
because the issue still hasn't quite closed.  The Interior Appropriations 
Bill may very well be vetoed.  But since our issue was settled at the staff 
level, and is now off the table, we're likely to remain safe from being 
re-examined and challenged.  In fact, any changes would likely only increase 
the strength of our hand: some members of our coalition are trying to insert 
even more detailed language in the report that prescribes exactly how the 
agencies will proceed to determine the new rental fee schedules over the next 
18 months.  Through outside consultants, we've had a series of constructive 
discussions with the agencies over the past two weeks that have forged 
agreements on timing and specific ways forward.   Details are forthcoming, 
but Enron would be involved closely in the process.  The agencies were 
clearly surprised by the clout we wielded, and are now more than willing to 
negotiate.

But the bottom line, again, is that we have stopped both agencies from 
implementing their costly interim policies or launching a rule making process 
either now (which they originally intended to do) or in the coming fiscal 
year.  And by engaging key Members of Congress and the White House, and 
organizing and leading the 20-member  Fiber Optic Public Land Right-of-Way 
Coalition, we've succeeded in branding Enron as a leader in the 
communications field.

		 Subject: Meeting with Governor Davis, need for additional 
comments/suggestions

We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA.  In attendance were Ken Lay, 
the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. 
spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his 
ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next 
week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  
Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on 
my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff 
Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our 
proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation 
based on the governor's comments:

Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that 
we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing 
communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to 
go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what 
the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more 
work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He 
talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail 
level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the 
benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he 
would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power 
(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented 
solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix 
the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.
Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also 
included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed 
interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a 
goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities 
to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate 
analysts and other "nonadvocates" to develop solutions to a number of issues 
including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  
He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas 
purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding 
some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.
His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously 
under serious consideration and some of which were mere "brainstorming".  
Some of these ideas would require legislative action.
State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of 
generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that 
they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This 
was a frequently recurring theme.
Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus 
basis to consumers.
Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in 
California.
State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more 
widely deploy distributed generation.
Expand in-state gas production.
Take state lands gas royalties in kind.
negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for 
addtional gas supplies.
Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant 
maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at 
any one time.
Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.
Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear 
more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be 
able to help out here).
Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made 
some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy 
some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation 
thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control 
approach with generators.
Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.
To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's 
thoughts and get them to Kari)
He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- 
not just the 5 one year strips.
He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.
He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the 
deal.
He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the 
forward contracting issues.
Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.

Another key point:  to avoid the mistakes of California, policy makers must 
make it easy to site and interconnect new generation.  In California peak 
demand rose by about 5500 MW from 1996 - 2000.  The market responded with 
porposed capacity additions of about 11000 MW.  Most of these facilities are 
working thier way through the tangle of state and local approvals.  The 
problems we saw in California did not need to occur if policy makers simply 
enabled the market to work.  Also, it's worth noting that the deregulated 
market did work.  Customers who signed with Enron saw a lower bill than 
prederegulation, Enron hedged its commitments and so our customers (and 
Enron) did just fine during the summer.  Deregulation worked; the problems in 
California can be directly traced to continued regulatory interference in the 
market.

Mark,

Here's my shot.  I did it in Revision mode so you can see the changes.  Note 
that Enron never got out of the retail market in CA and has gathered about 
1,000 MW of retail load -- we're bigger than all but two of the municipal 
utilities in the state.  Enron stopped marketing to residential consumers -- 
that's what all the  fuss was about in 1997.  Anyone else feel free to take 
your own shot.

Some of our people get asked on the phone about what is going on in 
California.  I have drafted the attached paper for their use.  It is intended 
to be simple and user-friendly.  Your thoughts on whether I achieved that 
objectvie are welcome.  More importantly, I need you to confimr that I got 
the story and facts correct, and that I have not said anything about the 
situation that you (Enron USA) would not want to say, or have not said, or if 
we have said something fundamentally different, I need to know that, too.   
thanks for taking the time to review.  mcs

Subject: Re: Daily Update / Legislative Update - 8/23/00  

It's hard to formulate a position without more of the specifics, but I think 
our message should generally be:
We support providing immediate rate relief to small residential customers.  
We believe that relief is best provided by giving San Diego the ability to 
procure power on a fixed price basis from the market.  San Diego has offers 
in front of it now; those should be evaluated and the legislature and the 
commission should give San Diego the flexibility to accept one or more of 
them.  This is sounder than running huge deferrals (deficits) to be later 
recovered from consumers.
Rate relief should be accompanied by real reform.  Rate caps have bad long 
term consequences: they cause shortages.  Combining short-medium term rate 
relief with expedited siting of new facilities will address the near term 
problem while laying the proper groundwork for a long term solution.

Subject: Daily Update / Legislative Update - 8/23/00

This email reflects today's events in Sacramento. The information provided is 
subject to change because of constant flux. However it is important for us to 
provide this information for feedback and to caution as to new regulations 
that may affect some deals in the making .

Governor Davis, Assembly Women Susan Davis, and Senator Alpert had a press 
conference.

They will introduce a rate/bill stabilization plan for SDG&E and an 
expediting siting bill. There is no language as of yet. 

Although there is no specific language, the following elements may be 
included:

The stabilization plan will be applicable to residential and probably 
commercial customers in SDG&E
The bill cap may be set at $68 for residential.
The cap will be in place until the end of 2002
There will be language on expediting siting for generation plants  

Sam Wehn and Sandra McCubbin have been talking with the CEC executive 
director and several legislators about the siting portion of the bill. 

Any comments as to the bill cap proposal?

Just had a preview meeting with Wade Cline and Neil McGregor (Pres. of DPC).  
They are very supportive of the effort and felt that, while "Jane, you always 
bring us such good news!" that the depth of analysis and real time concerns 
articulated was an excellent thing for the company.  In fact, they wanted a 
few more mitigants put in and then shot down, anticipating Jeff Skilling-type 
questions.  Thus, this regulatory risk idea if done in depth for each 
region/project, may be a bigger service for Enron than you guys had ever 
anticipated.  They also thought of one more tack to take on the renegotiation 
issue to figure out how far we could go.  Good deal.  (However, will still 
wear body armor/butt plate into the Sanjay meeting next Wednesday).

=09



Greetings All:

First, I am apologizing in advance for any typos in this email.  Schedule i=
s=20
very tight, but I wanted to make sure that everyone had it first thing this=
=20
morning, with some back-up info that I've included below.

Attached is the email that was sent to Ken Lay's office yesterday evening f=
or=20
delivery to Sen. Brulte.  It's of course confidential.  Few points:

I don't have Bev's email, so if you could please forward to her, that would=
=20
be appreciated.
As we discussed (Jim, Mike, Bev, Scott, Hedy) on our lengthy call on=20
Wednesday, I'm assuming that the plan is still to "wallpaper" Sacramento wi=
th=20
our proposed legislation.
This email does not contain the legislation.  Mike sent the "final" version=
s=20
of our legislation out yesterday, except for the siting piece, which I=20
believe Brian Cragg of Mike's office is finalizing today.
You'll note that we promise Senator Brulte in the email that we'll deliver =
to=20
his office today the proposed legislation.  Again, based on our call on=20
Wednesday, I'm assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposed=
=20
legislation to the rest of the world at the same time.
When we spoke on Wednesday, we decided that the Sacramento team would=20
determine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the same=
=20
time that we deliver the Senator Brulte. I'm assuming that you folks will=
=20
handle that end of things.  Please let us know at your convenience to whom=
=20
you've decided to circulate.
This email does, however, include a "summary" of our proposed legislation. =
=20
But I'm not certain that the summary included in this email is the=20
appropriate language to distribute "to the world," or if we'll need instead=
=20
to tailor some new language.  I think we all agreed that we need a "one=20
pager" to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the=
=20
package effectively.
We also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our=20
proposals.  We didn't finalize that plan.  Perhaps the Sacramento team coul=
d=20
propose a plan to do that.  Perhaps we could start with our friends in the=
=20
Direct Access coalition?
We also talked about the need at this point to engage in PR and to get the =
PR=20
machinery activated, also with the goal of effectively communicating our=20
legislative package/message.  We're in a meeting with folks today where we=
=20
can discuss getting that side of things going and Karen Denne has contacted=
=20
Marathon and they're pondering some things that we can do in the near term.
You'll note that there's a considerable amount of information about the DWR=
=20
credit issue.  As I recollect, we discussed the issue in depth on the call.=
 =20
You note that attached to the email is a "legislative fix" to AB1X that cou=
ld=20
solve the credit issue and an attached set of "taking points" related to a=
=20
second alternative to solving the credit issue:  a PUC order clarifying tha=
t=20
DWR will get its money for power purchase costs.
Note also that Steve Kean reminded me that we've got to continue to push to=
=20
get the utilities out of the merchant function.  Accordingly, I've put a=20
brief paragraph on that issue in the note to Brulte in the last section=20
(legislative solution) under the topic "create a real competitive retail=20
market in California."  To the best of my knowledge, we don't have=20
legislative language on that piece yet, and it seems that we'll need to=20
discuss it in considerably more depth before doing so.


If you have any questions about any of the materials in the email, please=
=20
don't hesitate to contact me or Jim or Sandi to discuss.  I can be best=20
reached to day by pager at 888.916.7184. =20

Thanks to all for helping pull this together.

Best,
Jeff

It was a pleasure speaking with you yesterday.  Based on our conversation,=
=20
this email includes the following:

An Enron contact to discuss developing small-scale generation on Tribal lan=

Our views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on h=

possible options for addressing the credit issue are 1) a California PUC=20

amendments to AB1X.  We believe that an amendment to AB1X is the preferable=

2. Key Barriers to Distributed Generation

Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges

Solution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took=
 a=20
step in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been=20
designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract=20
monopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit t=
he=20
elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than=20
1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for=
=20
California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc=
e=20
the risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose lifting the cap by=20
offering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o=
f=20
distributed generation.
=20
Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with=20
investor-owned and municipal utilities

Solution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is =
a=20
step in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20
interconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this=
=20
requirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20
generation.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when=
=20
interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome=
=20
through executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent=20
possible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th=
e=20
utility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be=20
accomplished through amendments to SB 27X.

Permitting and Air Quality Issues
Developers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs=
 or=20
greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an=
d=20
therefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20
generation faces. =20

Solution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru=
=20
D-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant=
=20
output apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facil=
ities.=20
In addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to=
=20
face local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial=20
interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects=
. =20
These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.

3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase=
=20
Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20

Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with=
=20
suppliers.
Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th=
e=20
goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.
However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk=
=20
concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.
We understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c=
redit=20
risk concerns.
Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and=
=20
is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to=
=20
both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements=
=20
going forward.

Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue

Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority
The language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20
charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our=
=20
analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20
California PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  =
As=20
such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat=
es=20
adequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.

Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018
The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public=
=20
Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are=
=20
=01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref=
use to=20
allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20
purchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr=
ee=20
to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that=
=20
DWR has entered into with suppliers.
=20
Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to=
=20
Recover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases
In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority=
=20
noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to=
=20
the specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl=
oy to=20
permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i=
s=20
extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu=
re=20
DWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it =
is=20
difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in=
=20
rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase=
=20
costs.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since=
=20
suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover=
=20
from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.

Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20

We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri=
sk=20
issues.  We have identified three options:

Amend AB1X
The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the=
=20
PUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur=
red by=20
DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary =
to=20
ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the=
=20
preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political=
=20
challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20
entitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)

Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20
through Contract Language
This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20
implement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo=
re=20
time to implement than the "legislative" fix.  We have attached electronic=
=20
copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC=
=20
would need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,=20
=01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)

Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk
As indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac=
cept=20
other forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,=
=20
cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have=
=20
indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR=
=20
prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through=
=20
contract amendments.

4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001

Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20
Associates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports=
=20
showing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They diffe=
r=20
only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  Al=
l=20
credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer=
=20
of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20
likely. =20

CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20
summer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our=20
estimates.  California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,=
 well=20
below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio=
n=20
in the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power=
=20
than other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20
unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t=
o=20
date. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t=
he=20
flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20
California=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to =
this=20
requirement. =20

Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early=
=20
draw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve=
re=20
supply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced=
=20
number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20
utilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren=
t=20
pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be=
=20
added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.

CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of=
=20
rolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more=20
optimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000=
=20
MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California=
=20
should view the CEC's "rosy scenario" with considerable skepticism.

5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California=
=01,s=20
Electricity Crisis

This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil=
l=20
deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing=
=20
bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.

As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's=20
crisis must focus on four issues:

Increase supply
Decrease demand
Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market
Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency

Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)
To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. =
=20
Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less=

Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment
To be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:

We estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in=

In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when=

Thanks for taking the lead on this.  Note Tim's question about handicapping 
the liklihood of approval.  Prices will move in the West based on these 
odds.  We need to have a better view than anyone else.

Subject: Re: ISO Market Stabilization Plan  

Tim,  although there's always a "chance" my impression is that the FERC won't 
buy the ban on exports, as this would appear to run afoul of the Commerce 
Clause and certainly goes counter to everything that FERC hopes to accomplish 
with their own Order 888 and 2000 initiatives.  I am less certain about the 
direction FERC will go on pricing, since even the staff has recognized 
stumbling blocks in their own recommendation and offers possible variants.  

The ISO has not submitted revised tariff sheets for approval yet, so it is 
unlikely they would try to implement their own plan in the near term.  If 
they try to do so without FERC approval, possible legal avenues might include 
the filing of a complaint at FERC, asking for fast track processing (this 
"fast" is measured in weeks, not days) and/or seeking injunctive relief in 
court (faster), which can be hard to obtain but not impossible, depending 
entirely on the circumstances.

Will keep you posted if I learn anything new on this.  Ray

Subject: ISO Market Stabilization Plan

The recent plan filed at FERC is horrible.  The two most aggregious parts are 
the cost based standing bids and the ban on exports.  I know that we are 
commenting on this proposal.  I am also looking for intellegence on whether 
the ISO proposal has any chance of getting approved by FERC.  If it is not 
approved by FERC, what can the Californians do?  California has ignored FERC 
before.  If they attempt to unilaterally implement changes what is the 
likelihood that the Feds step in to intervene?  If you hear anything on this 
matter please keep me posted.  The proposed plan will have a huge impact on 
the California market and we need as much advance notice as possible.

All--here's some thoughts on the RGA related events.  We currently have Ken 
scheduled to participate in an energy roundtable discussion on the afternoon 
of the 2nd with at least four governors attending that session--Kempthorne, 
Hull, Geringer and Ridge.  (Engler and Rowland are also attending the overall 
event, but they will be in a healthcare breakout session).  Kaufman and I 
thought that it would be particularly helpful for Arizona Gov Hull and Idaho 
Gov Kempthorne to hear Ken's remarks and have a chance to talk with him.  

I have also been working with Rosalee to schedule an early evening 
(6:00-7:00pm) meeting that night  with Exelon co CEO John Rowe. John Rowe 
will be in California for some investor meetings and well as attending some 
sections of the RGA events.  I have told my counterpart at Rowe's office that 
we would confirm Ken's availability on Monday morning.

If you do decide that Ken should attend the Davis meeting in Sacremento that 
day instead, we will just reconfigure a bit.  Paul and I will cover the RGA 
events and I will cancel the John Rowe get together. I would also want to 
talk about having Mr. Lay reach out to Hull and Kempthorne via phone sometime 
in the near future.  Same with Rowe.

I received a return call from Lelanie in Governor Davis' office this 
evening.  She said the Governor wanted to invite Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling to 
a meeting the Governor is having at 2:00 p.m. in Sacramento on May 2 with a 
lot of CEOs.  I still pressed for a one on one meeting on May 3 in 
Sacramento, but she told me the Governor wanted to have the one meeting all 
at once and his schedule was very tight on Thursday, May 3.   I transferred 
her to Sherri and called Ken.  Ken wanted me to try to get more specific 
information, which she shared that it is with generators - Sempra, Williams, 
CalPine, Duke, Dynegy, and Reliant.  She also said since the Governor has 
worked with Ken, she thought he might prefer that he attend.  Ken said to let 
you all know and be thinking whether we even want to do it.  He said one 
thought might be that he'd do that meeting and maybe Jeff could do the one in 
L.A. on May 2.

Talk to you Monday.

Just so we're all on the same page......Dasovich will arrive in Houston on 
Monday (mid-day) and will travel with Dr. Lay beginning on Wednesday (to 
Austin) and then on to LAX, Sacramento etc.  Steve said there really isn't 
time to have a pre-briefing so any questions that Ken has will have to be 
addressed enroute to CA.  

Rosalee....we're giving Steve the briefing book today so he can review over 
the weekend and we'll have a final copy to Ken before he departs next week.

Congratulations on your new position!
This all came up rather suddenly, at least as far as I can tell.  If you have 
any interest, I would like to talk to you sometime.

Per our conversation on coordination of our efforts on California and other 
jurisdictions, we have developed the following training program:

1.    Anti-trust -- we have completed anti-trust training in Houston for 
traders and have scheduled it in Portland and Calgary.

2.    Sales Practices -- this training has been completed in Portland and is 
being scheduled in Houston and Calgary.

3.    Anti-manipulation -- this training has been completed in Portland, but 
needs to be expanded to cover local law manipulation issues.  It also needs 
to be scheduled in Houston and Calgary. 

Also, the above training needs to be supplemented with training on local 
power pool rules.  There is a similar program being prepared in London.  A 
meeting is being scheduled so we can discuss these matters further.

What are our chances of final approval at FERC at the JUly meeting.  Jeff 
still thinks this is a third quarter close.  Do we have any chance of making 
that happen?

I would like to do this, but I have a speaking engagement the next day -- do 
the time zones work out so that I can do both or do I need to find a sub for

You might be interested to know that I gave Enron a big plug last week when I 
served as guest host on the evening
European news roundup broadcast from CNBC's London studios.

I am having lunch on Monday with Michael Isikoff, a newsweek investigative 
reporter.  He is doing yet another Ken Lay/Enron political influence story.  
One of the things he wants to talk about though -- and I think this is a good 
sign -- is Enron's climate change policy and how it compares to the 
administration's.  What I need from you, as soon as possible, is a timeline 
(what the Administration said when -- doesn't have to be down to the day); 
the Administrations position; and our position (and how they differ).  Borrow 
heavily from existing materials.

Subject: Transatlantic meetings

To the Executive Committee:

Attached is a note that has been sent to our managers regarding off-site and 
team-building meetings.  My impression is that our commendable efforts to 
build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get-togethers that 
require substantial travel.  Our challenge is that such gatherings are far 
more costly and time-consuming for us to attend than our Houston colleagues 
might realize.  Often, participating in these meetings takes an entire week 
for Enron Europe employees (especially if they are outside of Texas). 
Naturally, they may feel that this time of year (PRC time) is exactly the 
wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering.

These off-sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter, which 
compounds the difficulty; worse still are the times they occur at the end of 
Q2, since it also coincides and conflicts with the PRC process.

I would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the 
travel time and costs (both direct and indirect) when inviting international 
employees to off-site meetings in the US.  We appreciate the chance to be 
included in the broader Enron initiatives and to share ideas across 
organizations, but we are really trying to reinforce the message about 
managing expenses.

Thanks!

John Sherriff


(Letter sent to all Enron Europe VPs and direct reports)

We still have issues regarding Offsites and 'Team Building' exercises.  In 
particular, we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform 
other key work groups when workplace absences are pending.

In order to avoid misunderstandings, and to increase transparency, the 
following will apply with immediate effect:

Any Offsite or 'Team Building' exercise which any group (both commercial and 
non-commercial, and including John and myself)intends to undertake must be 
communicated, in advance, to all department heads. Issue to be identified 
include:  all participants who will out of the office, total costs of the 
exercise; and, where appropriate, work load coverage details.

John and I are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer 
that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends. To the extent that is 
not possible, we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is 
appropriately covered.

Trips to Houston and especially resorts in the US are far more difficult to 
justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved.  So please 
pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel.

Please communicate this policy to your staff.

Michael Brown

Steve -- great guidance.
Cynthia -- hope we're in time.
Jeff -- the fifth paragraph has some supply/demand figures for the early part 
of this week that I heard but can't track down the written source. Any

FYI:

Early next week, EES is filing an environmental permit for a gas fired or 
diesel 50 megawatt mobile, temporary generation
"facility" in Gallup, New Mexico.  We anticipate that we will use gas, but in 
either case, we will not pass the emmissions threshold.
Obviously diesel will provide less generation.   Enron currently has a gas 
compressor on site and we own the land.  
We are seeking to deliver the power to markets in the west. This will serve 
the Palo Verde region.  Jim Steffes has been
advising as to the local permitting processes.

I will keep you in the loop as we proceed.  We will probably look to permit 
other such generation facilities in the west.

Hi Steve,

I thought it might be nice to send Korn/Ferry (Bob Laughman and Trigg 
Bracewell) a thank you note. I've attached a first draft of two letters (one 
for each). Feel free to make any changes. I'm happy to send out once you've 
reviewed, or if you prefer to have Maureen make changes and send out, I'd 
just like a copy.

Thanks.
Lisa

Contestants must travel from Amarillo through Fort Worth, Dallas, Houston,
San Antonio, and back to Amarillo, through San Marcos and Lubbock... driving
a Volvo with a bumper sticker that reads:

"I'm for Gore, I'm Gay and I'm Here to Take Your Guns".

The first to complete the round trip is the winner.

I think the letter is well organized to get our message across that a
comprehensive solution is needed.  The only concern I have is the reference
at the end of the first paragraph to  "the crisis grows daily with no clear
resolution offering long term relief in sight."  In fact we do no have
several bills on demand side management, one by Wright on accelerating
repowering of power plants and allowing incentives for voluntary
conservation, at least a vehicle for utility cost recovery (AB-18X), and a
Bown bill to restore direct access rights compromised by AB-1X.  So I am
concerned that the legislative leadership would take some umbrage at the
notion that we dont see any of what they are doing as offering hope for a
long term solution.  Perhaps we could rephrase it to say that the piecemeal
elements of positive solutions that have been discussed or offered need to
be clarified and blended into a comprehensive proposal which has the
following elements....and then lay out our case.

Sandi, do you agree with my concerns?  Otherwise the elements of the letter
are fine, and track what we are trying to draft in terms of legislative
language.  I will break down the proposals into groups of issues for ease of
review, even though we may later want to consoliate the entire package.  

Please call if you have any more questions.  

Thanks, 
Mike Day

Subject: BLM/Forest Service Right-of-Way Update

The Senate voted on the Interior Appropriations Bill late yesterday.  Our 
amendment passed, which prevents either BLM or the Forest Service from 
enacting new fiber optic federal lands rights-of-way policies.  The BLM made 
a last ditch effort to defeat this in the Senate, but we had reached key 
Senators and staff and they got nowhere.

Action now moves to Conference, which for us means a focus on the House 
Conference members.  Scott and I will spend the next 2 days meeting with the 
key Republicans in the House.  We've already recruited the important 
Democrats.  Interior Approps Subcommittee Chairman Regula remains opposed, at 
least publicly, but we think we can get other Members to swing him.  We trust 
he'll come up with a sensible, face saving compromise on his own, eg, 
formally beginning a review process with his Subcommittee having oversight -- 
at this point, our language literally forbids BLM or Forest Service from even 
meeting to discuss the issue.

We continue, though, on several other fronts:

1. We have the New Dems writing OMB on the issue and several Senators and 
Congressmen writing BLM and USFS
2. We've increased the pressure on the White House, and are letting them know 
through very senior back door channels that in our opinion, BLM/Forest 
Service have not gotten the message.  Our position is that we'll be satisfied 
that they've changed their evil ways when the new assessment on the Mt. Hood 
EBS build is retracted.
3. We're preparing both Senate and House authorizing Committees for the 
longer-term issue next session.  We have no trouble finding champtions eager 
to own the issue
4. We're engaging the Western Caucus for same
5. Our adhoc coalition continues to grow in numbers and clout with over 20 
companies and associations now actively engaged.  Enron chairs this 
initiative, with a tangible side benefit being much increased visibility and 
stature as a serious communications player.
6. Scott is successfully engaging state and local officials to weigh in from 
the end-user perspective

BLM is on the retreat and has asked for a meeting, which we've refused.   We 
don't think they've given up though, and it's likely an issue of pride at 
this point.  So until the Approps process concludes we're continuing with the 
full court press.

Steve

Dear Ms. Clark,

Here is my question:

Would you allow our staff and customers to vote on Enron adopting the 
International Standards Organization Specification for formatting dates (i.e. 
"YYYY-MM-DD")?

Please let me know if you would like me to send you a list of the many 
advantages in using the ISO standards.

I asked Ken Lay this question a few years ago, but he thought we should use 
local customs; however, as we are becoming more international and more 
internet-based, the ISO standard is becoming more advantageous.

Thank you,

Subject: RGA request

Rick--you may have seen a recent  letter from Gov Jim Gilmore and the RGA 
requesting that we make an additional contribution in the next few weeks to 
the RGA for their polling/advertising/grassroots efforts on the upcoming 
November elections.  They list a fundraising goal of $1,660,000 (just a bit 
aggressive!)  If we are not able to make an additional contribution,  he asks 
that we renew our 2001 annual membership of $40,000 now instead of in January 
of 2001.  If we do anything, my recommendation would be to cut a check now 
for our annual membership (the downside of doing that, of course, is that 
they will hit us a number of times in 2001 for incremental contributions to 
specific events/causes).

I bring this to your attention for two reasons-one is that if I know Governor 
Gilmore, he will probably make a call directly to Ken Lay and you and Steve 
may want to have an answer available if Mr. Lay gets the call.  Secondly, 
what are your thoughts on my response to RGA?  My preference would be to not 
commit to any additional dollars, with a fall back that if Gilmore does call 
Lay and he wants to respond positively, we then commit to renewing our 
membership early.

Subject: Northeast Water Plant

February 26, 2001

I note that the HAWC and the Northeast Water Plant is on the Infrastructure 
Committee's agenda tomorrow at Houston City Council.

I am concerned about the proposed Azurix project with the Houston Area 
Water Corporation and the City of Houston. Two weeks ago I met with the 
Mayor and City Attorney on the Mayor's political business and they told me 
of their concern about the future of Azurix.  They wanted some assurance 
from Ken or Jeff that Azurix would be around as a part of Enron if it were 
awarded the Northeast Water Plant Project.  I believe they had some 
communications with Azurix officials but they really wanted to hear from 
someone at Enron.

I sent the word back to Enron through Joe, that someone high up should 
contract the Mayor and the City Attorney to give them whatever assurance 
they could concerning their concerns. I believe Joe discussed this with Steve.

Last Wednesday night I saw the Mayor and asked him if his request through 
me had any results.  Had he heard from Enron?  He said no, and that he 
needed to have some better feeling about the future of Azurix.

I assume we are working hard to get this project but based on my 
conversation I would think we need to give some communication to the Mayor 
from someone high up in the Enron organization.

George

The proposed purchase of the PGE and SCE's transmission grids have vastly 
different short term liquidity effects for PGE and SCE.   If the current 
proposal is at 2.3x book, and assuming the first mortgage bond holders want 
complete repayment in return for releasing their liens, the numbers (at 
12-99) fall out:

in millions                   PGE        SCE

Book Value                    1.43       1.90
Multiple of Book              2.3x       2.3x
Cash Price                   $3.29      $4.37

-First Mortgage Bonds        $3.35      $1.18
Resulting liquidity         ($0.06)     $3.19


Note that the first mortgage holders may release their liens in return for 
partial payment based on remaining value.  Nonetheless, PGE's situation is 
not as flexible.

Janine and Barb -- could one of you get in touch with John?

		 Subject: Help in Michigan

Once again, I come to you for help.  We were awarded a biosolids dewatering 
contract in Grand Rapids, Michigan about a month ago.  We had bid against the 
incumbent, a company called Synagro.  You may recall that Azurix is in 
litigation with Syangro over a busted acquisition, but the two events are not 
related.  In any case, we were low bidder, and the recommendation was made to 
award the contract to us.  Synagro has been working to get the award 
overturned, and appears to have been successful.  It is not yet clear whether 
they are going to award the deal to Synagro, or re-bid.  It is not even clear 
what the grounds are for overturning the award, which indicates that it may 
be pure politics.  

Do we have any good political consultants that could help us in Grand 
Rapids?  We do not have much of a presence in that area, and were responding 
to a publicly advertised bid.  Price and technical qualifications were the 
only issues.  Politics did not enter into it until now, so we were caught a 
little flat-footed.   

Any suggestions?
