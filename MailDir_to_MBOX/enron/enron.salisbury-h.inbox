We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

Heather,

  Do you know :
  If there are 3 strips in a deal that cover different time periods, say April 1 for a strip, April 2 for another strip, and April 3 - 31 for a third strip....if we plug in a price on only one of the strips, are the days from the other strips going to get valued properly?  

 In the instances that we have had, all three strips were filled in and Risk valued the deal properly; it was just CARP and UNIFY that were reading three times the MW Month amount, which I guess in the end is a simple problem.

 Holden brought up this point and I wonder the same...do you know?

Update...

The Internal Communications department has not yet released the original video. I don't have an ETA at this time.

I would like to have a feel for how many people are still interested in viewing this meeting. Please send me an email if you are interested in viewing the replay of the All Employee Meeting. I will then communicate with those who are interested. DO NOT select reply to all as it will go to all Calgary and Portland employees.


Regards,

Dan

Subject:	Viewing of All Employee Meeting

All,


The viewing of the All Employee Meeting today was not a complete success despite our successful testing yesterday. There were several IT teams (your local IT Support as well as Houston based Web and Network teams) that worked together to troubleshoot the audio and video feeds while watching the performance of your sites communication links with Houston to ensure your trading business was not compromised. I would like to provide you some history as well as go forward actions to provide better audio/video streaming services.

You may have noticed that the medium for viewing the meeting has changed from the previous IPTV application to a web based application. This new medium has been in the development stages with the production target of October 2001 which was set by business. Last Friday business approached IT infrastructure and advised that there would be an All Employee Meeting on Aug, 16 (today). This didn't provide much time for preparation and testing. During the troubleshooting for each of your sites, the Network team (Scott Shishido and George Nguyen) were able to determine some but not all causes to the poor performance. I will be meeting with the Web (Edward Ray) and Network (Steve Hardy and Scott Shishido) teams to determine what the action plan is for resolving the performance issues.

My understanding is that the meeting will be available for viewing if you wish to do so. I will be communicating to you when your site will be able to view this replay of the All Employee Meeting.

Please contact me if you have any questions or concerns.


Regards,

Dan Dietrich

FYI: Option Exercise in Enpower will handle the Index Forward as follows.
Do you use the Option Exercise for any other options?

       Option Exercise ver 3.0.0.24 is in P:\Powersys\stage.

       It should exercise Index Options to Index-Forward deals and it writes "HOUR"
       in term_strip_expiry_freq_cd in pwr_term_strip_rules table, so Portcalc
       can make difference between such an Index-Forward deal (from exercising an option)
       and an ordinary one.

Subject:	 Index Option

We have the approval from the business unit (Matt Motley) to implement Index Option deal type as such:

Index Option will be a physical option with a strike @ an Index.
For a BDay option expiry the analysis will work as follows:

The forward position will be valued taking the deal strip hours, these hours
will be valued against the scalars - the hours in the money compared
to the forward underlying price will be estimated as exercised. Only the hours
in the money will be evaluated.  For the day of exercise the hours evaluated will
be the hours exercised in scheduling. 

Daily the Option Exercise function in Enpower will create an Index Forward Leg
from the Index Option (expiry will be daily but the price will be hourly) @ a strike of the specified Index.

Liquidation:
Liquidation for the next day will be calculated using the actual exercised strip against the curve as the mid price.
The True-up will be index vs curve when the index is published.


This is how we would analyze each hour.  
The sum of each hour will be the value of the option.

For each hour:
HE7 = 
Strike = Forward Price (since Index is not available)
Underlying = Forward Price * scalar
Vol = Daily Vol
Rate = Libor
Time = same as daily (treated as a daily option for time)

Vo =f(u,s,v,r,t)
V = Intrinsic + Extrinsic

Matt I need written confirmation regarding the analysis of the new Deal Type "Index Option" for IT to implement.

will be valued against the scalars - the hours in the money compared

be the hours exercised in scheduling. 

Buy Call: Estimated Exercised hour will have a price above the mid
Buy Put: Estimated Exercised hour will have a price below the mid

Daily the Option Exercise function in Enpower will create an Index Forward Leg
from the Index Option (expiry will be daily but the price will be hourly) @ a strike of the specified Index.

Liquidation:
Liquidation for the next day will be calculated using the actual exercised strip against the curve as the mid price.
The True-up will be index vs curve when the index is published.

PGE has informed us that they have a couple of voice mail cards that are down.

WHAT THIS MEANS:

If a call that is going to voice mail hits one of these cards, the call will continue to ring without ever getting to voice mail. 

This is a random event as calls get routed to cards based on availability.

If this happens, the party would have to call back and try again, or get a hold of your admin to leave a written message.


THE FIX:

PGE will have cards here in the morning and will replace them on Saturday.  They are waiting to do this because it will require a system wide outage of voicemail.

The repair is currently scheduled for this Saturday, 10:00 PST and should last no more than 2 hours.


Please let me know if you have any questions.

Regards

Dave

In an effort to support our fellow citizens during this time of disaster we will be collecting donations for relief efforts in NY, DC and PA.
A designated collection box has been placed by the lobby area.  All donations will be double matched by Enron.

If we all donated what we have would spent on the complimentary lunch today or what we would spend on coffee tomorrow, matched double by Enron, it would really add up.  The money will be sent on Monday, September 24.

The funds will be donated to the following organizations, please pay by cash or check payable to an organization listed below or a relief organization of your choice.  We will take care of the appropriate matching donation forms.

United Way Sept 11th Fund, <http://september11fund.org/>
American Red Cross Disaster Relief, <http://www.redcross.org/>
NY Police and Fire Widows & Children Benefit Fund,  <http://www.nypfwc.org/>

Hi,

I want to let you know about a QuickBase database called "Pool Information Guide".  You can get there by clicking this link:

 https://www.quickbase.com/db/6545ewmy?a=i&pswd=dynicdfpr

Here's a quick description of the database:

"WELCOME to the "Pool Information Guide" and thank you for taking the time to register!  Please click "ADD RECORD" to fill in the template with your information.

This on-line database was designed to help all of us stay in touch this summer at Enron and beyond (and to save us from having to keep forwarding and updating spreadsheets).  Feel free to update your record and/or download the database as often as you like.  Please encourage your peers to register with the site so that we may all benefit from having one central reference point.

You can use this site to locate someone's desk, to find out who is working on projects of interest to you, to get the word out about your interests beyond your assigned project, to round up folks to discover Houston with, to see who is celebrating a birthday, or to plan a carpool or shared commute to the office.

You will notice that there are several required fields - these fields will be used by HR for their "book."  All Summer Associates & Analysts will receive a copy of this book, which will also contain our pictures.

Enjoy!
    John Walt

(Please direct technical questions to Laura Ann Jones at 3-1413 or laura.jones@enron.com)

Instructions in Short:
______________________

To ADD YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION:  Click on "Add Record" and fill in the template.

To PERUSE the database:  Click on "List"

To EDIT your record:  Click on "List" then "Edit"

To DOWNLOAD the database into Excel:  Click on "List" then "Spreadsheet".

To PRINT the database:  I highly recommend downloading the database and then printing as usual from Excel.  Printing from the web page only gives you part of the whole spreadsheet.

To SORT the database:  Click on one of the pre-defined "Views" to the left.  Email me if you want to sort by something new.

ps.  The reason we need to keep our attached pictures 10k or less is QuickBase is only free for databases less than a meg in size.

pps.  Please keep in mind that if you lose your password or want to invite other people to join the Pool Information Guide - just send me an email and I can help.  <laura.jones@enron.com>"

By the way, going to the link above will automatically add you (or anyone else) to the access list for this database, so be careful to whom you forward this e-mail! (This link will expire in 30 days.)

If you're not already a QuickBase user click this link anyway.  At the sign-in screen click the Register link.  When you're all done registering, QuickBase will bring you right to this database!

1.  We will post all of the numerical results on Enron's corporate intranet.  (Probably not the individual comments, though, because that would be way too much to read!)

2.  Our programs are based on what you want, so we need your feedback to assess how we're meeting your needs and where we can make improvements.

The survey will only take you about ten minutes or less, honest.  Thanks for participating.

Last night our main 'Server' failed, and we have been working since to restore service.
 
It looks like we lost NO data
 
For the time, you cannot get to your H:, P:, W:, R: (Local Drives)

Hey Guys.

The ISO cutting our off-peak imports from PV has been an ongoing problem. Now that we are doing congestion wheels again we can finally do something to avoid these cuts using congestion wheels. 

Normally the ISO will cut our Import and shift our load from NP15 (PGE1&2&3) across the path to relieve the congestion. If you submit a congestion wheel there cannot be $30 cong,  thus they will not cut your schedule going in at PV.  Instead of shifting your load the ISO will award your congestion wheel and everybody will be happy. It is important to make your wheel larger then your import to ensure that part of your import not getting cut. I would recommend to put in the max number of MW's you think you can buy in the North and get rid of in the Desert. Go big in the off-peak, we submitted 200MW wheels Saturday and I think its safe to do similar size most nights.

Friends and Co-Workers:

You are hereby cordially invited to a pre-holiday office lunch this Thursday at approximately 11:30 a.m, courtesy of the Trading Attorneys.

LEGAL NOTICE:  Christian Yoder and Steve Hall (hereinafter "we" or "our" or "us" ) intend to pay for the food (which will probably, but not necessarily, be pizza and salad) with post-petition Chapter 11 salary dollars that have already cleared our respective individual bank accounts and, therefore, by joining us in the meal ("Lunch") you will not be exposed to any retroactive claw-back risk by way of the Cash Account Committee.  We are also investigating the possibility of providing a limited quantity of a certain kind of beverage ("Beer") under a provisional waiver of the defunct pre-petition Company's drinking policies, subject to approval by the Estate's Liquor Control Board which is being sought on an expedited basis.       

We feel like making this modest holiday gesture for several reasons: 

1.  It has been a pleasure working with you all during the past year.
2.  We are optimistic about this office's prospects in the upcoming year.
3.  American Express forgot to cancel our Corporate Cards.

We hope you will join us for a free lunch as we look forward to a prosperous New Year.

Christian and Steve

Please keep in mind when entering NPC transmission into Enpower.  

Beginning July 2001, the ancillary services rate for
Nevada Power has been changed from $0.70 to $0.58539(roughly 59 cents) per
MWh. 

TOTAL = $0.58539 per MWh

Reserved transmission is $1.70 LLoad  $2.90 HVLoad

If the transmission is wheeled the .59 should be added to the reserved price and the amount entered should be:

$2.29  LLoad

$3.49  HVload

The problems I see are deals entered at prices of $4.10, $3.60, or $2.40 or deals have been entered in at the reservation charge even though they the transmission was used.

Here is amy's message forwarded.  looks like we actually flashed close to the correct amount. 
this looks like an accounting variance more than a DPR impact.

Virginia - 

In April Risk flashed ($67,580) for WAPA CRSP trans.  You were also given in April , DPR of $3,495.50. This would bring your books to reflect the true/finaled amonut of $64,084.50.  The DMS variance was strictly an accounting variance - we used that to adjust to what we accrued - which was the multiplying incorrectly piece.  So no more DPR - your books should be good for April WAPA CRSP trans.

Let me know if you have any more questions - A

Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.  We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, "Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company."

S&P also said, "[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales."

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.

We will continue to update you as new developments arise.  Thank you.

	In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities.

	Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group.    

	Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

There are several new computer viruses that are spreading rapidly on the internet.  The viruses target Windows computer users and arrives in e-mails with various subject lines like "Fwd:Peace BeTweeN AmeriCa and IsLaM!" The messages also contain attachments that can be directly executed by clicking on the attachment.  The most prevalent virus has an attachment named wtc.exe. 

If you ever get an email with an attachment that has an executable file, you should never launch the attachment.  At Enron, these file types are blocked automatically from entering our environment.  However, if you would connect to an external email service (i.e. Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc) while using an Enron computer or attached to the Enron network, you could infect our internal computing systems.  If you do, the virus could cause significant issues and prevent some of our systems from working effectively.

If you ever get an email that you are not sure about, simply delete the email and contact your resolution center to let them know how you obtained the message.  It is much better to be safe than sorry as we will be able to track down the origin of the virus in the Enron Network.

Thank you.

Please be aware that the last leg of transmission listed on tag #28010 is a dummy leg of transmission that needs to be placed on the tag in order to reflect Valley Electrics Load at Mead 230.  We use this dummy leg of transmission because Valley Electric does not have a PSE acronym in the OATI tagging system.  We have been creating tags such as this since the OATI tagging system has been in use and have not or should not be getting charged for using NEVP trani.  Please refer to the following tag numbers as examples:  22655, 22654, 26279, 26387.  Please note that each of these tags was approved by NEVP the control area and NEVP the transmission provider and therefore has been implemented.   It was our understanding that this was a practice agreed upon by NEVP and Enron in order to reflect Valley Electrics load at Mead.   My contact at Nevp is Jannella Battles.   Please, keep me in the loop as to what the result of this issue will be.

I do remember this deal, we were forced to bookout by some a-hole at pinwest because of the disaster and our inability to secure a scheule from DYPMI and Morgan who was upstream of AEP who was scheduling from home (as was I).  Tom  did the deal with Pinwest our buy for $40, and I did the deal with DYPMI our sale at Index.  I told the SW guys about this the following day, and in the mayhem, the deals probably did not get put in.  Holden and Tom and Mark were all aware of this at the time, and one of them may have also modified our deal with DYPMI.

They can throw those deals in, or I can.  Just let me know.

Cara,

I have a dispute  from Pinnacle West for Sept 12 at $40.  I've checked the sheets and the deal is in the sheet, but there is no deal number.  This leads me to believe that there isn't a deal in Enpower.  The deal is PV HV and Staci remembers the problem.    

Let me know when we can talk about this

Management and employees both have roles in meeting Enron's commitment to Equal Employment Opportunity, and Harassment Prevention.  To achieve Enron's vision, we need to recruit, select, retain, and manage the most talented people effectively.  We expect all employees to demonstrate Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence in the workplace.  Our efforts to achieve equal employment, and prevent harassment for all employees will guide us towards ensuring that each employee and organization is as productive, inventive, and competitive as possible in a world of changes.

Enron is an equal employment opportunity (EEO) employer.  In choosing to do business with federal, state, and city government agencies, Enron implements affirmative action plans (AAP) to recruit, retain, and promote women, minorities, individuals with disabilities, and covered veterans.  Our efforts are inclusive and based on sound business practices, individual qualifications and merit.  Employee and management conduct is expected to be inclusive and equitable in all aspects of the workplace, including recruitment, applicant screening, hiring, training, assignments, compensation, benefits, job performance evaluation, disciplinary action, separation, and the like.  There is no place at Enron for management practices that include bias, favoritism, discrimination, harassment, or conduct that otherwise violates the law or Company policy.

Enron's Harassment Prevention Policy was developed to prevent harassment and help all employees to maintain a productive and mutually rewarding work relationship.  Harassment of any type, including sexual harassment, is contrary to our policy and preventable with education and respectful personal behavior.  We want all employees to know what harassment is, how to prevent it and how to report it.  Our policy outlines these unacceptable behaviors and helps employees better understand work-related expectations and steps.  Every employee at Enron is expected to prevent harassment and report it if it happens.  

Enron's Fair Treatment Policy was developed to provide and maintain a work environment in which all employees are treated equitably.  Our goal is to resolve employment disputes promptly, informally and (where possible) at the lowest level.  Employees who believe they are treated unfairly are encouraged to discuss the matter with their immediate supervisor.  When a concern of unfair, unlawful or unsafe treatment is raised, it will be investigated thoroughly and promptly.  An effective resolution will be reached based on all the information.  The Company will take reasonable steps to ensure confidentiality, but must act on assertions indicating that a violation of policy or law has occurred.

Each of these policies is available for review at http://home.enron.com/resources.  Please familiarize yourself with these policies.  Enron expects and encourages every worker to report workplace issues of concern.  If you need to speak with anyone someone regarding these policies or if an incident occurs that concerns you, please talk with your supervisor, contact your Human Resources representative, or call Enron's Office of Labor and Employment Relations Department at 713-853-7573.  Management is expected to ensure retaliation does not occur.  In addition, Cindy Olson, as  is Enron's EEO officer.  As and  Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Community Relations, Cindy has the responsibility, authority, and full support of Enron to ensure that all employees can avail themselves of our policies.

Your support of respectful workplace relationships adds to a productive and rewarding work environment.  In turn, such personal and organizational success adds to Enron's business success.

Thank you.

SACRAMENTO - When the Creek Fire in Mariposa County broke through its

containment line Monday (August 20), 65 fire engines from across the
state were already staged nearby. They had been called in during the
previous night by the Governor's Office of Emergency Services (OES),
part of the 290 engines dispatched  statewide through California's
Fire and RescueMutual Aid System, coordinated by OES.

	OES called in engines from as far south as San Diego and as
far north as Mt. Shasta to a staging area in the city of Madera. The
wildland and structure-protection engines had been trickling in since

1 a.m. to be on hand as needed. All 65 were, in fact, needed at 11
a.m., when winds picked up and sent the 4,000-acre Creek Fire in
Mariposa County through its containment line.

	The Creek Fire moved north at about noon, leading to
evacuation orders affect 15-20 homes on Jackass Ridge Road and
additional houses on Harper Road. To the north, residents of
Groveland and Big Oak Flat were advised to evacuate as a precaution.
To assist the four communities, the American Red Cross opened a
shelter at the Coulterville Community Center in Mariposa County.

	In all, OES has committed 90 of its own engines, 200 local
engines (cities, counties and special fire districts) and 11
California National Guard helicopters to fight four California
wildfires.  Those fires are:

?	Creek Fire in Mariposa and Tuolumne counties at 4,000 acres,
50% contained with 21 OES and local government engines. Since the
fire started 5 p.m. on Saturday, it has injured 3 and threatened 3000

homes.
?	Ponderosa Fire in Placer County which is 2,440 acres and 50%
contained, with 80 OES and local engines. Since the fire started at 2

p.m., Friday, it has threatened 200 homes and led to at least 18
injuries.
?	Leonard Fire in Calaveras County, which is 3,000 acres, 10 %
contained, with 70 OES and local engines.
	Since the fire started at 2:15 p.m. on Friday, no injuries,
300 homes threatened, evacuations in progress.
?	Highway Fire in Fresno County which is 120 acres, 0%
contained, with 10 OES and local engines. Since the fire started at
6:45 p.m. on Sunday, threatening 12 homes and six outbuildings.

	OES coordinates state-level emergency preparedness, response,

recovery and mitigation for a wide range of natural and human-caused
emergencies and disasters.  As part of its responsibilities, OES
coordinates the state's Fire and Rescue Mutual Aid System.  Through
this 'neighbor helping neighbor' system, fire-fighting resources from

throughout the state can be called on to support  local governments,
and work with other state and federal fire agencies.

Deadline extended through Tuesday, Sept. 25 for disaster relief donations.  So far we have $2049 ($6147 w/Enron match!).

Thanks for your support!




In an effort to support our fellow citizens during this time of disaster we will be collecting donations for relief efforts in NY, DC and PA.
A designated collection box has been placed by the lobby area.  All donations will be double matched by Enron.

If we all donated what we have would spent on the complimentary lunch today or what we would spend on coffee tomorrow, matched double by Enron, it would really add up.  The money will be sent on Monday, September 24.

The funds will be donated to the following organizations, please pay by cash or check payable to an organization listed below or a relief organization of your choice.  We will take care of the appropriate matching donation forms.

United Way Sept 11th Fund, <http://september11fund.org/>
American Red Cross Disaster Relief, <http://www.redcross.org/>
NY Police and Fire Widows & Children Benefit Fund,  <http://www.nypfwc.org/>

I need some quick education on transmission.  In a paragraph or two can you explain how you go about deciding what transmission to buy for a given schedule.  

I need to get a take on the over all strategy when buying transmission.  Is it based mostly on price and location?

Thanks

The Enron Building in Houston will be closed for the rest of the day.  The offices in New York and Washington, D.C. have also been closed, and all employees have been accounted for.  We're asking all Houston-based employees not involved in critical operations to go home to be with their families.  We have every reason to believe the Enron Building is safe and secure.  Each Enron location has the discretion to determine what is in the best interest of their employees.  We know of no Enron employee or facility affected by today's tragic events.  Let's keep all the victims of these tragedies in our thoughts and prayers.

Good Morning, Mark. An early note about the weather. 

This remains a very difficult forecast for the Southwest and California. Today's models have pretty much flipped around from yesterday - that is to say that the hot models yesterday are now cool and the cool models yesterday are now hot. 

The three players on the field remain the ridge in the West, the incoming trof, or storm, in the Pacific early next week and Hurricane Julliette. The interaction of which is very crucial for the weather next week. 

Today's American/MRF model and the NAVY model brings the trof to the CA coast by Monday and brings Juliette in the SW. By doing this, it is painting strongly cooling temperatures in CA and the SW early next week. We'd be talking 80s & lower 90s (though humid) in PHX and Las Vegas with 70s in the load centers of CA. I give this scenario a 30% of happening - the coolest scenario. 

Today's European model, a good model in the West, has a compromise - strongly heating coastal California next Monday and Tuesday while bringing at least some of Juliette's moisture in CA/SW. This would only mean some cooling in the SW with a major increase in humidity and at least 2 days of hot, humid weather in California, even at the coast. This scenario is 40% likely now and would still mean strong loads early next week in CA and the SW. 

Today's Canadian model shows the ridge in the West dominate - holding off both Juliette and the incoming storm from the Pacific through next week. This would mean little change in PHX & Las Vegas and at least several days of near record heat in California. This scenario would represent the other hot extreme and I give this about a 30% chance to happen. 

The market will likely either follow the cool scenario altogether or be uncertain - Very few ball players will recognize the potential in this pattern. I am still leaning toward the idea that a 70% of decent heat and humidity in CA and the SW, but obviously with subtle uncertain details that make a huge difference in the weather its still too early to tell exactly. 

Please forward this to those in interest - please call if there are any questions or interest in a conference. 

- Dave Ryan

As in UBS AG:
AG means the same thing as "incorporated" or "inc."

>From a German dictionary:
AG [a  ge ]
(pl. -, -s) (f) (abbr) (= Aktiengesellschaft) plc (Brit);corp. (US);inc. (US).


For those interested in more German:
(incorporated company: Comm: Brit, US) Handelsgesellschaft f;
(limited liability company: Comm) Gesellschaft f mit beschr?nkter Haftung;
(Comm) private/public ~, Privatunternehmen nt/staatliches Unternehmen;

If anyone can actually pronounce these words, stop by.

A final word on the new DMS procedure. Mike feels it's important you know that Volume Management will thoroughly research each discrepancy before bringing it to your attention.

"Make sure they understand that we will exhaust all of our efforts before we send it over to them.  
All notes will be provided on the DMS telling them where we are and what we found out and where they should look," says Purcell.

So when the discrepancy shows up in your file, which you will check at the beginning of each shift, it is there because our back office professionals have hit an impasse and require your assistance to get through it. That means it's important.

Thanks,
Kate

Our Director of Corporate Travel has informed us that American Express will not be able to establish a new Corporate account for us at this time.  

Until we are able to obtain company-sponsored credit cards, when incurring company expenses it will be necessary to use personal credit cards or cash, which can then be submitted for reimbursement through the expense report system.   You may want to refrain from incurring any reimbursable expenses until we receive further assurances from the company that they have the processes in place to pay them.  As information becomes available about administrative operations, I will relay it to you.

Please contact me if you have any questions.

Due to the flooding, electrical and communications problems in Houston over the weekend, several Enron Information Technology systems experienced outages.  At this time all critical systems have been restored and should be operational.  

In the process of restoring service, several user and common data directories had to be restored from the backup tapes from Thursday evening.  Therefore, some of you may be missing data files on your H drive or M drive that you created or modified on Friday.  

If you have any questions or have any IT related problems, please contact the Resolution Center at x31411 for assistance.

Looks okay so long as Holden confirms that he want the delivery days to cover Sunday and Monday only.  I get Monday if the Monday is a holiday.  Holden, do you also want to cover a non-holiday Monday?

Leslie, 

Please take a look at this loadshape as well for Hoden Salisbury: 

OffPk 8hr  PPT 

The transaction is for the hours on each Delivery Day (i) beginning with the hour ending 0100 (12:00 am midnight) and concluding with the hour ending 0600 (6:00 am) and (ii) beginning with the hour ending 2300 (10:00 pm) and concluding with the hour ending 2400 (12:00 am midnight) (8 hours each day) Pacific Prevailing Time.  "Delivery Day" means a day during the term of the transaction that is a Sunday or Monday, including any day that is a NERC holiday.


Thank you, 

Chris

Although it will be tough to fill her shoes, Susan Rance (503/464-7086) will be coordinating with the rest of the credit department to help us address credit issues.  Please refer all questions and inquiries regarding credit to Susan.

Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

Per Matt, I have entered annuity deal# 872229.1 (STWROCK paying LTSW $2 MM) due to the revaluation of index option deal #804470.  Deal date 11/15/01.  Please let me know if you have any questions on the annuity entered.

Thanks,

Subject:	UAMPS deal transfer

Please note that there is a new deal entered today to transfer the BOM portion of the UAMPS deal from LT-SW to ST-WR per Matt's request. The deal details are:

Index-Option: 807382.1
Term: 10/8/01 - 10/31/01
(we use the same method to pick the hours as we use for the CSU option)
The MTM value calculated from this deal for ST-WR is $30,685.

For Monday strip:
Index-Forward: 807382.2
Term: 10/8/01 - 10/8/01
HE 11 - 10mws
HE 12-14  -  25mws
per Holden.

The BOM strips for the index-option deal #804470 in LT-SW have been zeroed out.

An annuity deal #807428 was entered for the difference between $2.5 MM (per Matt) and $30,685 = $2,469,315, for LT-SW Buy from ST-WR.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Samantha

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

AEP COMPLETES PURCHASE OF HOUSTON PIPE LINE COMPANY FROM ENRON
COLUMBUS, Ohio - American Electric Power (NYSE: AEP) announced that it has completed its purchase of the stock of Houston Pipe Line Company (HPL), an intrastate natural gas pipeline subsidiary of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE).  The acquisition includes inventory and a 30-year pre-paid lease related to the operation of the Bammel Storage Facility.  The $726.6 million for the transaction will be raised by issuing a non-controlling, preferred equity interest to private investors.  

The purchase, announced Jan. 11, 2001, was completed following clearance from the Department of Justice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. HPL owns, or leases, and operates one of the most extensive and flexible natural gas gathering, transportation and storage operations in Texas. HPL's intrastate system includes more than 4,400 miles of pipe with capacity of approximately 2.4 billion cubic feet per day and the operation of the Bammel Storage Facility, one of the largest storage facilities in North America with a capacity of approximately 118 billion cubic feet and significant injection and withdrawal capacity.

IN THE NEWS

Enron Tops Gas Market: Higher commodity prices and greater demand have generated record earnings for many gas marketers during the past quarter, making energy one of the few sectors gaining ground in the U.S. economy. Leading the pack is Enron whose gas volumes grew 30 percent, with 27.2 billion cfd traded on average by March 31.

=====================================

Course Title: 	Derivatives II (Energy Derivatives--Advanced Structures & Marketing)
Dates:		Wednesday, November 14th & Thursday, November 15th (2-day course--attendance required both days)
Time:		8:00am - 5:00pm
Location:		2WTC Oregon Room
What to bring:	Pen (or pencil) and paper
Other items:	Course materials provided at start of class
			Breakfast and Lunch will be provided both days

Course Description
This course builds on our Applied Energy Derivatives program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective.  Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring / marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.  Applied Energy Derivatives, or its equivalent is a prerequisite for this program; no other advanced preparation is required.  CPE Credits: Accounting & Auditing 2; Consulting Services 1; Management 1; Specialized Knowledge & Applications 12.

At the conclusion of this course, participants will be able to:
Decipher the role of the price curve, volatility, and time in determining the intrinsic value and time value of an option premium
Understand how a dealer 'trades volatility' and dynamically hedges an option
Recognize the limitations of traditional option pricing models when applied to energy
Annualize a periodic (e.g. monthly) volatility and vice versa
Create synthetic puts and calls using put-call parity to exploit mispriced options
Incorporate volatility term structures, "smiles and skews", in analyzing deals
Establish a delta-neutral hedge of an option and calculate the cost of changing prices on that hedge position
Comprehend the relationship between gamma and actual price volatility and its consequent implications for a dealer's earnings
Anticipate the irregular changes in gamma by stress testing option portfolios, thereby allowing more informed position management
Interpret an aggregated risk management report for an option portfolio and the positive or negative values for delta, gamma, theta, vega and rho
Structure an option on a swap to create innovative hedges for customers
Create extendable and cancelable fixed price deals
Embed a swaption sale to create sub-index physical supply to a user
Compare the merits and earnings opportunities among various alternatives available to a customer seeking to reverse an existing swap position
Determine the cash value of a swap terminated before its end date
Apply swaps with off-market fixed prices to monetize value in existing contracts or to provide for the cash/borrowing needs of a customer
Combine off-market swaps in complex structures: e.g. "blend-and-extend"

Change is inevitable (especially at Enron)!  Although the announcement of Jeff Skilling's resignation is a surprise and generally sad news, it is important to remember that our business here in Portland will not be affected by Jeff's departure.  Likewise, the leadership of Enron Americas and the broader Enron Wholesale Services management team remains unchanged by this announcement.  In summary, business as usual!

Subject:	USW Strike update

The current status is:

   As indicated previously there are many variables that prevent TransAlta
   from being able to predict how long we can maintain current output
   levels but we will advise in advance if changes from current operation
   are anticipated.  Coal blending impacts have resulted in some derates.
   The risk of disruption of coal supply or unit problems as a result of
   degraded fuel quality remains high.

   As with any labour disruption the situation could change quickly.

Regards,
Jim

The following additions and modifications to Stack Manager will be effective as of Saturday September 8, 2001.

Stack Manager Modifications

Inactivate All Stack - In addition to the individual Activate/Inactive Stack buttons, there is now an Inactivate All Stack button. Similar to the Suspend All button, this button will inactivate the trader's stack on all active products. Any existing top of stack limit orders will continue to post to the website and remain transactable. See screen shot below: Inactivate All Stack button on far right. 

	 

Please note that we have switched the positions of the suspend and inactivate buttons in Stack Manager.

Fill Order - If a product is set up as either Restricted Top of Stack or Top of Stack the trader now has the ability to automatically fill any order that is at the top of the stack. In order to fill a limit order that is at the top of the product's stack, which will appear in pink, the trader should right click anywhere on the stack window and choose "Fill order". The volume filled on an order will be that which is offered by the trader. In order to fill the complete volume of the order, the trader will need to adjust the volume in his stack.

Floated Stack windows - If the stack is inactive on a product, the price and volume fields on the my products tab will continue to be blank. On the depth window and floated stack window of these products the trader's prices will be in gray and italics. Children of products that have inactive stacks will not be gray and italicised in the floated stack windows and will not see the calculated prices.

No Auto Inactivate Stack - It is now possible to keep a product active even if the trader is not logged into Stack Manager. If the trader wishes to enable this functionality on the upper right corner of the product properties page the trader should choose "No Auto Inactivate when Stack Manager is down". 

Changes regarding Suspension of products

Stack Manager will inactivate products rather than suspend them in the following cases:

?	Market Close - If a product is active at the end of its trading hours its stack will automatically become inactive rather than suspending. In order to keep a product's stack active past the set trading hours, the trader should choose "Keep Awake" next to the trading hours section of the product properties page.
?	Auto Suspend now inactivates stack - On a product with the Auto Suspend function enabled to monitor the price changes on the product, the product's stack will be inactivated if the Suspend at level is reached. This feature can be used by checking the Enable box on the product properties page under the Auto Suspend section. 
?	Logging Out of Stack Manager- When you log out of Stack Manager without inactivating or suspending your products, the system will now inactivate your products rather than suspending them.

All,
	
We had a piece computer equipment that has gone missing.

The device is a network hub that looks like the attached picture.

It was hooked up to 3 computers over in the area of HR last night about 4:00 pm and was noticed to be missing about 6:00 am this morning.  If anybody know where it may have gone please let HR or myself know as soon as possible.


Regards 

Dave

We are currently using APS transmission to satisfy a LLH short position at Pinnacle Peak.  The revenue associated with the sale at Pinnacle Peak is $45/MWh.  The transmission is used to liquidate a long position at Four Corners 345 against the Pinnacle Peak short position.  The cost of the power purchased at Four Corners is $22.25/MWh.  Using the APS transmission is the most economic liquidation scheme at this time.  Our alternative would be to sell the length below the market value, and buy the short at above market value.  This assumes that we could find a willing buyer and seller. The spread between the purchase and sell price in this scenario is estimated at $5/mwh.  The cost of the APS transmission is $1.95/mwh.  

Salt River has the facility to provide the same service, but at this time they are unwilling to provide service to Enron.

Chip,

I have a new critical vendor with a prepetition invoice.  Arizona Public Service provides us critical transmission between the major trading points in the Southwest.  We owe them $43,708.60 for November transmission charges.  They will cut us if we do not pay.  I have explained that this payment needs to go through the creditor's cash approval process.

They can cut us starting tomorrow, but have agreed to a stay if we pay our December invoice of $8,071.20.  I will be faxing this invoice for immediate payment.

Steve

All,
	Tonight we are having the large 'TV' removed from the SE Corner of the floor and the one in the SW corner moved out of the walkway space.  

The removal of the large screen is due to how low it hangs and the hazard it presents to people walking in the area.  Since we do not use that screen, and we do not have a good place to put it, we will store it until a suitable use is identified. 

The smaller screen will be move North and East about 3 feet to get it out of the walkway.

Regards,

Dave

Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?"

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Thank you.

Bill; Spoke to Mike Cashell again this morning.  If you remember when we met with him this Spring, he mentioned that Idaho Power had the right to demand energy and or wheel through MPC's system that could cause them to be out-of-balance up to 25% of the time.  Starting yesterday Idaho initiated this process.  Mike has requested Idaho express their intentions on a preschedule basis where he in turn will notify you.  Today (6/22) and throughout the weekend MPC plans to be in a deficit position.  You might want to contact Mike (406) 497-4575 to work out a pre-notification process so as to help to identify "trends" so that our Real-Time group will be able to better anticipate MPC's needs.  Thanks,  John

PLEASE ENTER A PRICE INTO THE BUY FROM EL PASO - 679653 - AND NOTE THAT PRICE IN THE EL PASO MODEL. LAST TIME WE PAID BACK LINE LOSSES THIS DID NOT HAPPEN. 

Let me know if you have questions.

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Enron, according to Dr. Seuss...

They exercised and sold, exercised and sold.
And told all the employees to hold.
While they made billions, they continued to say
Our company will be the greatest someday.

But lo and behold it would not come to pass.
It was all a fraud and scam most would call crass.
"How could it be true?" we all asked.
"All we do is buy and sell gas".

But to make their personal billions
They had to keep in the dark their minions.
So they lied and cheated, stole and cajoled
Analysts, investors, workers and sold and sold.

But they found out the scam
And put the company in quite a stew.
They told Ken and Andy "we have lost confidence".
Little did they know, that confidence is what cons do.

The old man in charge said "we all trust Andy, he's fine,
He made me my fortune and never charged a dime!"
Andy got paid to manage illegal partnerships you see,
And for that he collected thirty m! illion as his fee.

But the pressure was on, and Ken had to act.
He told Andy, "You must go on leave"
Is he still on the payroll we asked?
We get no answer. Seems Andy will be there to the last.

Ken restated his books, and oh the looks that
Were on the faces of all but the crooks.
The books had been cooked! Not one year, not two, not even three,
They had been cooked a total of four.
And many suspect even more!..

He went into the elevator, that old gas trader.
He hit floor fifty, where his offices reside.
With two armed guards standing at his side.

And so he rose to the top of 1400 Smith
And went into the boardroom forthwith.
There were the ghosts of Fastow, and Skilling.
Where with their cronies they devised great scams.
How to deceive, cheat, and steal millions of clams.

And with one more scam to do
He picked up the phone and called his friend Chuck.
"Chuck", he said, " I'm in quite a jam, can! you please
help me I got caught in my scam".
So old Chuck bit a nd came to Kens side,
First with some money and took Ken as his bride.

But that old scoundrel had played too many scams
This one he could not hide as Chucks lawyers and guides
Went over Ken's books and found such a surprise.

There were no trades, there were no counterparties.
There were no assets, there was no Christmas party.
And so Chuck went to Ken and said "Your company
Is a sham. It was all lies. I cannot merge with you.
Your firm is a rotting carcass festering with flies!

And so Ken thought. He thought and he thought.
He will file Chapter eleven and fire a lot.
Four thousand to be exact.
We thought he has lost gazillions,
but prior filing he managed to bonus
his friends fifty eight Million.

And so we are told, the company will be back.
A shell of itself but not quite the same.
The shell is appropriate as we all know,
The core business of Ken is a shell game.

Attention: Portland & Calgary-based Outlook Users
The Global Messaging Team is proud to announce that beginning today, Monday October 15th, Portland & Calgary-based Enron employees that have been migrated to Outlook will be able to securely access their Enron Email from anywhere on the web. This means that if you can get on to the Internet, you can access your Enron Email with Outlook Web Access (OWA) without having to dial in to Enron's network. Please note that this is not available to those users still on Lotus Notes but will be available once they are migrated to Outlook. 
Once on the Internet, type mail.enron.com in your browser address window and supply your Enron network logon credentials as username and password. For example:
Username: jdoe4
Password: ********
Once you log in, Outlook Web Access opens your Enron Email mailbox. Outlook Web Access (OWA) allows you to send and receive mail, perform calendar tasks and manage your mail and contacts, as well as access your mailbox folders. At this time, Public Folders are not accessible via OWA.  Please keep in mind that Outlook Web Access is a browser-based version of what you might use in the office, so the functionality may be slightly different and some features of Outlook 2000 may not be available at all. Additionally, OWA is only supported using Internet Explorer 5.x only and not supported with Netscape.
Outlook Web Access is the standard Email package for connecting to your Enron mail from home, whether you are using an Enron-issued home PC, an Internet connection with your personal home PC, or your ClickAtHome PC. We will not support the use of the full Outlook installation for home use.
Outlook Web Access for some remote locations and European/APAC Enron sites is currently being addressed and will be available soon. At this time, OWA is only available if your mailbox resides on a Houston, Portland or Calgary mail server.

If you have any questions, please contact your local IT support.

There is a 25 mw heavy load schedule that BPA is generating (contract# 23299) and PGE sinks at system.   The schedule is going real-time because BPA transmission group did not build the proper account for this path.  We bought from BPA Deal # 308337.1 and sold to EPME Deal # 489735.1.  Please refer to EPME tag number #10416.  I spoke with Matt at BPA Power side who agreed this was a good schedule.  Be sure to call everyone in the path to check out.   

Thanks,
Stacy

Due to scheduling conflicts, the meeting has been moved to Friday October 5 @ 10:00, Mt. Bachelor.  Serena has also mentioned that there are some problems balancing the hour ahead and day ahead Enpower to Caps.  So my guess would be to re-group earlier.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
In early July, the EIM Fundamentals Siebel Team launched Siebel Episode II: Siebel Express Enhancements.  Siebel Episode II added a number of new fields and views to the Siebel database, which is currently available to each of the over 150 traders, originators and senior management at EIM. Siebel provides these users with the ability to store all of their accounts, contacts, potential deals and activities in a common, shared repository.  In early August, Enron Freight Markets will follow EIM's lead and launch Siebel Episode II to their front-office personnel.  

Enron Global Strategic Sourcing, in collaboration with Enron Net Works, recently executed a two-year agreement with SkyTel Communications, Inc. to provide users with one- and two-way local and nationwide numeric/alphanumeric pagers, advanced messaging service devices, and encrypted remote e-mail services via Blackberry? enabled devices.

Under this agreement, Enron will also receive special discount incentives including, 50% discount on Blackberry?-enabled hardware purchases through year-end 2001, trade-in allowances on select Research in Motion (RIM) units through year-end 2001, upload and download of contact lists from select pc-compatible hardware to new RIM devices, customized training for hardware and services featured quarterly, and monthly service costs that will be billed at 50% of normal rates for a limited time.

Personal toll free numbers, personal voice mail, operator dispatched text messages, pin-to-pin messaging and text-to-voice and text-to-fax service options will be available on select devices, including Motorola T900 and P935.

EA-Office of the Chairman
The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures in excess of $5,000 has enabled Enron Americas to better assess the business value of events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.  

EA has made some modifications to the process, which are described here.

The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to $500, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.

Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.

1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events with anticipated costs in excess of $500 must be reviewed by the Enron Americas Public Relations department and approved by the Enron Americas Office of the Chairman
2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and EA.

Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for various local sporting events and concerts.

If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.


IN THE NEWS

NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - As most players in a shrinking pool of online energy trading platforms struggle to stay alive, leader EnronOnline has a simple philosophy: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

The Internet arm of the energy marketing and trading giant Enron Corp., EnronOnline predicts it will increase its volume and says it can coexist with the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), the chief executive of Enron Networks told Reuters on Tuesday.

The innovative company is always evaluating its business environment, ready to remold itself according to market demands, but it is not pursing mergers or acquisition for now, according to Greg Piper.


UNITED WAY 2001
United Way Campaign:  Stay tuned...Enron kicks-off the company-wide United Way campaign on Monday, August 6.  It ends Friday, August 17.  EWS is shooting for 100% participation in this year's on-line campaign.

United Way Challenge:  To compete against the other business units, EWS must create a team of 7-10 people to build a model of Enron's attributes: Smart, Innovative, Bold, Ambitious, and United.  You will be provided with the building materials and you will have a total of 45 minutes to work along with your teammates to get your model completed.  The primary building material will be Legos.  After the competition, the Legos will be donated to local non-profit childcare centers.
On Friday, August 10 at 11:00 am, the teams will meet to begin construction and they have 45 minutes to complete their model of Enron's attributes.  At 12:00 pm, Ken Lay will host the judging competition with the winner decided using "The Applause Meter."
Each team must consist of 7 to 10 members from their business unit and must have at least 3 executives (i.e., Directors or above).  The model must be freestanding.  And, although Legos will be provided as the primary building tool, other materials may be used, so use your imagination.
Please call or e-mail Julie Clyatt if you are interested in participating.  She can be reached at ext. 3-3256.

In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be "Double Deducted" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence. 

    

Thanks, Tony Jarrett

State's mutual aid system allows one community to help another during

emergency

SACRAMENTO - As fire crews across California begin to contain and
control numerous stubborn fires, many local government strike teams
that were deployed this week through California's Fire and Rescue
Mutual Aid system are returning home to their local departments.

"Earlier this week as fires raged out of control in California, the
Mutual Aid system allowed California fire departments to come
together and rapidly contain the stubborn blazes," said Dallas Jones,

Director of the Governor's Office of Emergency Services.  "Mutual Aid

is basically the concept of 'neighbor-helping-neighbor' deal with
emergencies."

Currently, five large fires and complexes continue burning throughout

California.  In the early hours as these blazes evolved, local fire
crews quickly realized they would need additional resources and
requested assistance from OES.

At OES Headquarters, staff was quickly mobilized round-the-clock to
respond to the requests and deploy strike teams, in many cases, on an

"immediate need."  At its peak, OES deployed 26 strike teams of local

government and State OES engines, totaling more than 130 engines and
an estimated 520 fire fighters 

California's Fire and Rescue Mutual Aid System, administered by OES,
is designed to assist the California Department of Forestry and Fire
Protection, and federal wildland fire agencies, and local
departments.  The system is designed to ensure that additional
resources are provided to local jurisdictions whenever their own
resources are committed or insufficient for a fire.

Currently, only seven percent of the approximately 1,000 local
government engines available through the mutual aid system have been
used in Northern California.  Additionally, 10 percent of the State
OES' 110 engines are being used on the fire lines.

State OES engines are provided to local governments for use during an

emergency or disaster.	Under an agreement with the state, when
requested by OES, fire departments are required to dispatch the
engines, including personnel, within an hour to the scene of an
emergency or disaster in California.

When not in use during a disaster, local departments may use the
engines for mutual aid response, for neighboring cities and counties,

local multiple alarm fires, temporary replacement of out-of-service
engines, for training, and for other local needs.

Hello all!

As you are aware, Houston is asking all Enron employees to be involved in their United Way Campaign. While you are encouraged to take part, please keep in mind that we will be doing a Portland United Way Campaign to benefit our local community.  More information will be available in the next month or so.

In the meantime, you are more than welcome to donate to the Houston campaign in addition to your assistance with our Portland efforts. To access the Houston donation site, visit https://hrglobal.enron.com/. Your GIS ID (the "9-number" you used to access PEP) is your login.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

few minutes to impact the Greater Houston area in a positive way through a =
contribution to the United Way.  Further, if you have problems accessing th=
e system or don't have time, please call or e-mail Eric Thode (ext. 3-9053)=
 with your decision and he will log it in for you.  The system will then se=
nd you a confirmatory e-mail that you can check for accuracy and keep for y=
our records.

ACCRO Phase III - IV =20
We are pleased to announce that final acceptance has been received by our c=
lient Accroven SLR (50%Enron) from PDVSA-Gas (Venezuela's National Gas Comp=
any) for the facilities built and performance tested by our Accro Project T=
eam. Thus completing the final major milestone on what must be considered t=
o be one of EEOS's most successful projects.=20

Although contracted as one $320MM project, the work had to be managed as fo=
ur distinct jobs. The prime site, at Jose, consists of a grassroots 50,000 =
bpd NGL's Fractionation Plant plus Offsite Refrigerated Storage; the latter=
 facilities, being contained entirely within PDVSA's existing live plant, h=
ad to be built entirely under PDVSA's Hot-work Permitting system.  In addit=
ion, the site was under constant threat of disruptive action by very vocal =
and active Unionized workers. Thanks to the negotiating skills of our Site =
Manager, Tony Burke, they were shut-down only 25% as much as three adjacent=
 major projects .The secondary sites, at Santa Barbara and San Joaquin, con=
tained two grassroots 400MMSCFD Propane Extraction Plants. Not only did the=
ir remoteness cause significant logistical problems for equipment delivery,=
 but also both had significant labour relations problems peculiar to their =
own locations. San Joaquin suffered many days of Force Majeure delay caused=
 by the disruptive action by several local community groups protesting lack=
 of work.

Despite all the impediments of the local labour, logistics, and the usual c=
ustoms clearance issues, the construction was essentially finished on sched=
ule.

Commissioning and start-up brought new challenges with erratic feedstock qu=
alities testing both the design and the expertise of our start-up crews. It=
 is a tribute to both, that all performance tests were passed within 48 hou=
rs of receiving a reasonably stable supply and the design flow rates, and t=
hat the plants have remained online since, or available, with minimal hiccu=
ps, generating significant income for our client.

Congratulations Accro Project Team!
Bob Meckna, Tony Burke, Andy Trevino, Dennis Zitterkopf, Bill Johnson and t=
he rest of the team at site, in Houston, and from Teesside for achieving a =
remarkable success for which all participants can be proud; not only has th=
e client gotten plants that exceed performance, the team was able to bring =
home double the budgeted profit.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

EES Europe Clinches Long-Term Outsourcing Deal With Guinness
EES Europe has signed a 15-year agreement to own and operate energy assets =
at the Park Royal Guinness Brewery in London. The deal means EES will sourc=
e gas and electricity to provide steam, compressed air, chilled water and o=
ther industrial commodities to one of the largest breweries in Europe. EES =
will also have responsibility for managing a series of energy reduction mea=
sures at the plant, designed to improve performance and reduce costs. These=
 measures will include investment in new boiler, refrigeration, compressed =
air and effluent treatment plant.

Stuart Rexrode, Vice President of EES Europe, said: "Closing this deal was =
an outstanding effort by the entire team and is another example of the type=
 of innovative energy partnerships we are forming in the marketplace. This =
transaction, coupled with the Sainsbury's deal, has caused the industry to =
start taking notice of EES, and I am confident more customers will be knock=
ing on our door looking for similar structures."
Congratulations to everyone on the team for their dedication!

Enron signs first long-term dry bulk shipping freight origination deal with=
 major Japanese player
Enron's shipping freight team has signed a 10-year time charter deal for a =
178,000 tonne capesize vessel with Lepta Shipping (with a performance guara=
ntee from Mitsui & Co Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). The agreement has a notional valu=
e of USD60 million and a mark-to-market value of USD 5 million.  The new ag=
reement gives Enron the option to buy the vessel in Japanese yen after the =
third year and the time charter period itself can be extended by us by up t=
o an additional four years, if required.  The agreement takes effect from t=
he latter part of 2003 when the ship itself, currently being manufactured i=
n the Imabari shipyard in Japan or any similar substitute vessel, becomes a=
vailable.  "We are already in the process of onselling the first three year=
s of our time charter above the curve," announces Pierre Aury, who heads up=
 Enron's dry bulk freight team.  "This deal gives us a strategic long "days=
" position and we now expect to close further deals as a result of our driv=
e to commoditise more time charter transactions."  The team is already expl=
oring new time charter deals in the scarcer cape-size and handy-size vessel=
 market.  A combined effort between the legal, tax, credit, transport suppo=
rt and structuring teams was instrumental in helping to book this deal just=
 in time for Q2.  The shipping freight team is already working on a new str=
uctured deal with a major UK bank, so watch this space for future announcem=

Enron Credit Closes Deal with Enron's Shipping Desk
On 8 August, 2001 Enron's shipping desk bought a Digital Bankruptcy Swap (D=
BS) from Enron Credit in order to buy protection against a Japanese industr=
ial/trading counterparty.  Under the terms of the deal the shipping desk wi=
ll receive pay-out from Enron Credit when this counterparty becomes insolve=
nt under Japanese laws and therefore hedges the counterparty risk that the =
desk holds when transacting with this Japanese counterparty.  When the leve=
l of the shipping desk's mark to market profit rises above a certain amount=
, the desk will also have the ability to buy additional DBS protection.  Si=
milarly, if the desk's contract with the Japanese counterparty terminates e=
arlier, the desk can sell back any unused DBS cover to Enron Credit.

"We needed to increase our credit capacity with this counterparty in order =
to do more deals and then realised that Enron Credit could help us," said P=
ierre Aury who heads up the freight team. "Another driver was that we felt =
we needed to set a foot in the DBS market in order to go up the learning cu=
rve and develop shipping specific DBSs for the near future." "The hedge bet=
ween these two commercial groups is another milestone in Enron's internal r=
isk management.  With each commercial group having to optimise its capital =
at risk, the services and tools Enron Credit has on offer are an excellent =
complement to our already sophisticated RAC process," commented Ted Murphy,=
 Head of RAC in Europe.

Congratulations go to Andrew Feachem who originated the deal for Enron Cred=
it and Pierre Aury.

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

Hi Mike,

Starting July 2001, we have updated our energy loss rate for ancillary
services from $0.47644 to $0.45764. Apparently, we have been mistakenly
overbilling our customers by $0.0188 since March 2000. Therefore, a credit
will be issued in the July 2001 invoice for the differences for the period
from March 2000 to June 2001. Please update your total current ancillary
services rate to $0.6812(roughly 68 cents).

Thanks,

Jackson

EWS has been asked to sponsor the Center for the Retarded, for this year's Days of Caring.  We need your help to make this effort a success.  

What are the Days of Caring?

United Way Days of Caring began in 1992 with 800 volunteers from area corporations.  The Days of Caring for the year 2000 grew to over 7,000 participants from the Houston area.  During the annual Days of Caring, volunteers put their caring into action by working at agency locations.  Donors are able to see for themselves the work done by the agencies, meet those who are served and learn more about how their investment in the United Way impacts our community.

What agency are we sponsoring?

The Center - Serving Persons with Mental Retardation   

*	 Serving Bay Area and Fort Bend, Harris, Montgomery and Waller Counties  
*	 Provides opportunities for persons with mental retardation to maximize their potential for independence.   
*	 Services include: adult activity centers, education, community living options, employment and health services.   
*	 For more information, visit the website at: www.cri-usa.org <http://www.cri-usa.org> 

How long will I be away from the office? 

You have 2 shifts to choose from.  We will provide your transportation to and from the location.    

The morning shift will start at 8:15 a.m., Friday August 10th, with a kick-off from the Office of the Chair.  The bus will then leave at 8:30 a.m. and will drop you in front of The Center.    The bus will return you to Enron by 11:30 a.m. where you can grab your complimentary sack lunch from Chick-Fil-a. 

The afternoon shift will begin at 1:00 p.m. and last until 4:00 p.m.   

The Body Shop has been generous enough to let us use its shower facility for anyone who chooses an outdoor activity.

What will I need to do?

You have the option to sign up for a variety of activities.  These activities include Landscaping, Heavy Cleaning, Light Construction, Painting, Arts & Crafts, Playing Bingo, and Hosting a Party (providing baked goods, punch, and snacks).

Will I need to bring any equipment / supplies?

Depending on the activity you choose, you may be asked to provide equipment / supplies.  The necessity for supplies may range from construction paper and scissors to rakes, brooms, and gloves.  Your Business Unit representative will follow-up with more details.

Contest Information -

For everyone in EWS who participates in the Days of Caring, your name will be entered into a drawing  to win 1 of 5 American Express Gift Certificates. 

As I stated earlier, WE NEED YOU TO MAKE THIS EVENT A SUCCESS.

Per several conversations with Mirant (our upstream) and Pinwest (our downstream) the following situation occurred on July 19th between 2:30 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.   

Deal #694398 $41.00 our purchase from Mirant
Deal #693496 $40.75 our sale to Pinwest

Mirant(G)sp15-Ciso(t)sp15/pv5#scem_sp15_pv-Mirant-Epmi-Pinwest-aps(t)pv/ww#gf-Pinwest

Mirant was cut by the CISO per Dan at the Mirant Real-time group.  He was unable to re-supply an upstream.  Pinwest would not allow the schedule to flow on a real-time basis per Carla on the scheduling desk.  Enron agreed to bookout out with Pinwest and bill LD's to Mirant.   I spoke with Glen Ryan at Pinwest at about 3:30 to agree on a price at which Enron would buy back the power in order to bookout.  He said it would have to be the purchase price which was $345.00.   In a later conversation about 3:45, I told Pinwest that we would not agree to the purchase price of $345.00 and that the current market price was around $45.00 - $50.00 per mw hour.    They would not agree to the current market price and will bill us L.D.'s.

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

Hi Anna. Due to the amount of refunds the airlines got from all the

Dear All,

Today we have calculated and entered the annuity to account for CSU transfer from LT-SW to ST-WROCK for June 2001.  Here are the specifics:

Deal # 630226.1
Amount: $2,981,238
LT-SW will be paying ST-WROCK for the position transferred.  The economics will be reflected in your P&L as of 6/1/2001.

In addition to entering the annuity, I have zeroed out June 2001 strip in LT-SW deal # 573463.1 and added May strips in ST-WROCK deal # 576470.1.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Fran

Dear Fran:

  West Wing, West Wing 500 kV and West Wing 230 kV are all mapped to WSCC-S, but West Wing has a basis, B2, while the other two delivery points don't.   So if you want the other two  delivery points to use the same curves as West Wing, all you need to do is to associate them with basis B2 -- you should be able to do it through Global Facility.  

  Please feel free to give me a call if you need any assistance.  Thanks.

- Zhiyun

Subject:	curve mapping issues on deals
Importance:	High

Dear Zhiyun and Norman:

Due to legal reasons we are in the process of changing deals with delivery point of WestWing to either WestWing 230KV or WestWing 500KV.  However, in PortCalc if the delivery point is changed to WestWing 230KV or WestWing 500KV the deals will be valued against WSCC-S curve, not WestWing curve.  Due to this we have observed unfavorable prior day and curve shift; this is not what our traders expected and wanted the deals to be valued.  An example is deal#802862.1 in which delivery point was changed from WestWing to WestWing 500KV on 10/5/01 and we suffered a $294K loss due to the deal change.  (post id 13377 on 10/5/01 vs. post id 13337 on 10/4/01)

We would like the deals to be still looking at WestWing curve when delivery points are WestWing 230KV or WestWing 500KV.  Please change the mapping of the valuation in PortCalc so the traders can get their deal change and "unreal" curve shift back.  

Please let me know your timeline on this and if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Fran

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Your table shows a short of 25 RTC (vice HLH) at Pinnacle Peak.  In
addition, we are only buying 25 HLHat Mead 230, but have a short of 50 HLH??

This is everything for PNM.  We still need to buy 25mw heavy load at
Pinnacle Peak.  PNM did everything else.  I will send you a complete email
as soon as we procure the last piece.

If you were mapped to one of these printers and you still reside on the 3rd floor, you will have to choose another printer. Please feel free to get Chip or myself if you need any assistance.

They should be entered with the price in only one strip, however, once they fix CARP, we may not need to worry about this.......I'll let you know.  Heather has a call in to the CARP IT people.

So how should these deals be Enpowered in the future?  Cara has wisely warned me not to Enpower multiple strips to avoid this double counting.

Subject:	DPR on your PMA's

Mark, Tom, and Holden,

In reference to the DPR impacts of $ 132,000 (WAPA) and $133,000 (SRP) that you were expecting, here is an explanation of why you will not be seeing that in your PMA's:

The 2 deals listed below were put in as a MW month, each with 3 strips in the deal separating out April 1, April 2, and the rest of the month.  The reason for the 3 strips was to catch the April 1 time change from PST to PDT.  

deal #  539126: 3 strips @ 2216 = 199,500 charge for the month in CARP (true value is - $66,500).
deal #  538832: 3 strips @ 2180 = 196,200 charge for the month in CARP (true value is - $65,400) .


Typically, I provide you with a report that tells you what $ amount to look for coming thru in your PMA's, according to the changes that I am making on the back end.  You then see the change in DPR come thru on a PMA report that Risk provides for you.  

When these deals hit Settlements, we recognized that the CARP was calculating both deals at 3 times their monthly value (and since we are purchasing, that is a negative three times against your books).  When the above + DPR impacts didn't come thru in your PMA's, we started looking at the deals to figure out why they didn't.


Here is a discription of the Risk - Settlements process:
Risk values a deal on the day of liquidation.  Any intra-month changes, even if they happen after the day of flow, get trued up by Risk and changed in the DPR.  Anything that gets changed after the end of the month, Settlements recognizes as a DPR variance and reports this to Risk and you see it affect your DPR as reported in the PMA report.

So the question was: When it came to recognizing a variance in Settlements, why weren't we seeing a + amount back to your books for 2 of the strips that I zero'd out? 

Houston Settlements looked into it and were seeing that these deals were originally valued at ($66,500) and ($65,400), even though CARP was showing that they were calculating at ($199,500) and ($196,200) ....

Heather Dunton and I did alot of searching for the answer and we found that:  When Risk flashed these deals in April, they flashed them according to a single MW month charge.  Regardless of how many strips there are, the deal is set up as a MW month and should, therefore, calculate as one single charge for the month. 

We found that CARP is reading these incorrectly and causing the confusion, (as I was seeing that the deals were calculating 3 times because that is how CARP and UNIFY were reading the deal). 

 The IT people in Houston are now working on fixing that glitch.

When it comes to DPR, your book originally recognized an impact of (66,500) and (65,400), which is correct.  Since your April DPR was correct, you will not see an adjustment in your PMA's.  

I recognize that this is not gratification for the + DPR impact that you were expecting and I apologize for the confusion and mis-information that I gave you in my report.  This has, however, helped us to hi-light a technical error that will save us alot of work in the future. 

Thanks for your patience while we figured this out.
Let me know if you have any questions.

 Thanks,

 Virginia

Not too much has changed - the models are sure having a tough time resolving this split flow thing and its giving me headaches. So far, things are going according to plan. I feel confident that we will not see a major surge into the river basins but I continue with the idea that snow melt will occur along with somewhat higher snow levels and warmer rains in the Northwest.

SACRAMENTO--The Governor's Office of Emergency Services stepped up
its aggressive attack on Tuolumne County's Creek Fire Tuesday
morning, doubling the engines for a total of 205, with an additional
65 engines that just arrived to the scene from across the state at
about noon. 

What has now been determined to be a human-caused fire, has grown
from 4,000 acres and 50% contained as of 7 p.m. on Monday to 10,265
acres and 0% contained by 6 a.m. today. The communities of Big Oak
Flat, Groveland and Smith Station, all located along Highway 120 in
Tuolumne County - have been added to the list of cities with
evacuation order. Three homes have been destroyed, and an additional
3,000 are threatened. There have been two injuries reported.
Evacuations are being made to the Mother Lode Fairgrounds in Sonora
and the Coulterville Community Center.

OES continues to manage the Mutual Aid System resources on four
Northern California Fires. In all, OES has committed 420 OES and
local government engines (including 86 OES engines) and 11 California

National Guard helicopters to fight four California wildfires.	
Those fires are:

?Creek Fire in Mariposa and Tuolumne counties at 10,265 acres, 0%
contained with 270 OES and local government engines. Since the fire
started 5 p.m. on Saturday, it has injured 3 and threatened 3,000
homes.

?Ponderosa Fire in Placer County which is 2,750 acres and 90%
contained, with 75 OES and local engines. Since the fire started at 2

p.m., Friday, it has threatened 200 homes.

?Leonard Fire in Calaveras County, which is 3,155 acres, 20 %
contained, with 90 OES and local engines. Since the fire started at
2:15 p.m. on Friday, no injuries, 300 homes threatened, evacuations
in progress.

?Highway Fire in Fresno County, which is 1,000 acres, 0% contained,
with 5 local engines. Since the fire started at 6:45 p.m. on Sunday,
threatening 12 homes and six outbuildings. A Red Cross shelter has
been established in Dunlap.

OES-related resources committed include 320 local government fire
engines, which represent approximately 32% of all local government
engines available through the mutual aid system (there are approx.
1,000 total available).  There are also 86 OES engines currently
committed to the fires, which represents 78% of all OES engines
(there are 110 fire engines total).  

The OES Fire and Rescue Emergency Operations Center in Sacramento
remains activated to coordinate the response to the multiple
statewide fires 24-hours a day as needed.  OES' Inland Region and
State Operations Center are activated in support of local government
EOC activations. Representatives from OES Executive, Law Enforcement,

Inland Region and California Department of Forestry and Fire
Protection are co-located in the Fire EOC.

Holden,=20

My name is Stuart Wright and I am the Director of Marketing and Sales for F=
riedWire Inc.   I check our use log everyday and throughout the day and not=
ice that you are always among the most intensive users of our Traffic Repor=
t System.  I am very thankful for this and was wondering if you could tell =
me what you do at Enron and (since you are such a great user) if you have i=
deas for enhancing the Traffic Report?  We would value your feedback highly=
. =20
=20
We are building two new tools that you should be aware of.  One is a greatl=
y expanded version of the Traffic Report that will contain the real-time pr=
icing and news from a major provider of this information.  We will be annou=
ncing more on this shortly and plan to deliver the new version in September=
.  Additionally, FriedWire is building a PJM information module similar to =
the California tab now contained in the Traffic Report, which presents regi=
on-specific information; in the case of PJM, mostly the LMP and FTR informa=
tion. Following PJM, we will be developing similar detailed regional module=
s for NY/NE and ERCOT (in order).  A very rough draft of the information co=
ntent in the PJM Module is outlined here in the attached PowerPoint file.  =
Some of the features you see may not be available in the very first release=
, but we'd love to hear your opinion on what features would be most useful.=
   We debated internally over whether or not our first independently releas=
ed PowerSurge product should cover PJM or some other region.  We chose PJM =
despite the fact that the PJM ISO already does a decent job of presenting/s=
haring market information and because PJM is such a liquid trading region a=
mong many of our existing clients.  Our goal, however is to build a product=
 that is so much more powerful than the PJM information interfaces (such as=
 eData) that in selling the product we never get asked the question "why sh=
ould I buy this when I can get eData for free?"  That means a fair bit of w=
ork, but it's also the kind of work that we're good at: charting, geographi=
c displays, interface design, e-mail and wireless paging notification, and =
integrating various data sources.  Some of the areas we think will be valua=
ble and set us apart from eData are
=20
}          Combining real-time and day-ahead LMP data with the public FTR d=
ata to provide a real-time estimate of FTR value
}          Easy interface for querying FTR data for the sake of competitive=
 intelligence in the primary and secondary FTR markets
}          LMP charts and maps
}          Eastern Interconnect frequency monitoring
}          Histogram displays of historical and real-time load and LMP data
}          Mapping of planned and unplanned transmission constraints
=20
FriedWire would be especially interested in knowing Enron's interest in the=
 FTR features.  In fact, if you have a PJM expert that would be willing to =
talk to our lead product developer, we would be grateful.  We know that PJM=
 does very little with their display of the FTR information and we know tha=
t there is a lot of competitive intelligence to be gained from it, but we'r=
e not sure how many traders are interested in FTRs.  Our understanding is t=
hat there's not a lot of liquidity in the FTR markets and therefore, there =
may not be lots of money to be made/saved there.  We also are going back an=
d forth about how to market and sell the PJM data.  Whether we integrate it=
 straight into the Traffic Report or make it the first of a series of regio=
nal intelligence modules in a larger product called "PowerSurge" is current=
ly unknown.  Also, the pricing for the product is not yet determined.
=20
Take Care,=20

Thanks,

I submitted the wire for the $757,200 payable to PNM.  Just keep me posted
if you need anything additional to supply the remaining Pinnacle Peak.  I am
glad to hear that APS is giving us transmission.  I was afraid they would
cut us because of the late $43k.

We have a receipt from CRC at Mead to fulfill the other 25mw's.  Also we

This is everything for PNM.  We still need to buy 25mw heavy load at

 There was a supicious device found at Portland International Airport this morning and they have blocked off a section of PDX.  This is causing flight delays as well as gridlocked traffic on I 205.  If you have a departing flight today, you may want to check with the airline concerning its status.

CORRECTION per the bolded text below.

On Wednesday, October 31, I sent an email to all Enron employees worldwide in order to ensure that Enron employees retained documents that might be relevant to ongoing litigation.  New lawsuits have been filed that enlarge the scope of the information that Enron will need to retain. The following list includes both the topics in the earlier email and the topics related to the new lawsuits.

Houston has requested we sit down with them on the phone and go over all the in-the-money contracts we have.  By their count we have about 50.  They want to account for each and understand why we may not be delivering on them.

Ed Baughman will be sending his master list in advance of a 11:30 call in Mt. Bachelor.  Please send at least one representative from each of the regional desks to discuss the list.

Thanks,

Steve

Please plan to meet at 1:00 p.m. on Wednesday for an informal question/answer session.  The best place to gather is in the rows between Trading and Origination.  Chris Calger will not be in the office on Wednesday, so I will be conducting the session.

At this point I do not have any significant new information about our company status, but I will relay the latest information that I have.  I know there are many rumors swirling around right now.  I will try to answer any questions that people have.  It would be helpful if people would submit questions in advance.  Although this is not a requirement for asking questions, it would be helpful if you would email questions/rumors to Julie Kearney before the meeting.

Please let me or Debra know if you have any questions.

Utility Pushes Panel for Rate Hike in Utah 

By Steven Oberbec, The Salt Lake Tribune -- July 31 
PacifiCorp Chief Executive Judith Johansen on Monday told the Utah Public Service Commission (PSC) her company was devastated by the Western power crisis last year and needs a $118 million rate hike in Utah to help it return to financial health. 
	
Utah Power's parent company requested the rate increase in January and the PSC will hold hearings through Friday to consider the company's request. 
PacifiCorp wants the $118 million -- about $7 per month for an average Utah customer -- to cover the millions it spent last year to buy electricity on the wholesale market. The power was needed to meet its Utah customers' demand during peak usage periods. 
Johansen said PacifiCorp's power costs are almost double what it is allowed to charge its customers under existing rates. Without the increase, the company's credit rating may suffer. 
Credit-rating companies such as Moody's and Standard & Poors "have a very keen eye" on PacifiCorp rate cases in Utah and other Western states because they are concerned about the company's cash flow and overall liquidity, she said. 
A decrease in PacifiCorp's credit rating could make it more difficult and expensive for the company to finance new power plant construction needed to meet the growing demand for electricity in its operating territory. 
Yet throughout most of the past decade, PacifiCorp generated more power than it needed to serve its residential customers. It sold the excess electricity under long-term wholesale contracts. 
Those long-term contracts benefited the company's customers to the tune of $1.3 billion over the past decade, said Stanley Watters, managing director of wholesale energy services at PacifiCorp. 
Critics, however, contend the company at the same time adopted a business strategy to increase its wholesale power business and entered into long-term power supply contracts while relying on the spot market for the electricity. 
The strategy worked until the spot-market price for electricity soared last summer when PacifiCorp suddenly got caught in the squeeze. 
The question of who should pick up the tab for the company's wholesale power strategy lies at the heart of the rate case now before the PSC. 
"Their [wholesale] business strategy exposed ratepayers to enormous risk," said Dan Gimble, who serves on the staff of the Committee of Consumer Services that represents residential energy users and small businesses in utility rate cases. 
PacifiCorp, though, contends it wholesale market strategy was prudent and benefitted its retail customers by helping lower the cost of a kilowatt-hour of electricity 30 percent from 1985 to 1999. 
"Absent the high market prices we've seen, I don't think any of us would be here today," Watters said. 
Utah Power's customers will be able to tell the PSC what they think of the company's rate hike request at 5 p.m. Wednesday.

12:24 28Nov2001 RSF-WRAPUP 1-Enron near collapse after Dynegy pulls out

    By C. Bryson Hull
    HOUSTON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. <ENE.N> hovered on the brink of one of the biggest corporate collapses in U.S. history on Wednesday as its rescue by rival Dynegy Inc. <DYN.N> fell apart.
    Dynegy accused Enron of breaching the representations it made when the takeover agreement was negotiated on Nov. 9, invoking an escape clause that let it pull out of the deal.
    Shares of Enron, recently ranked No. 7 on the Fortune 500 list of the biggest U.S. companies, had already lost most of their value and all three major credit rating agencies had slashed their ratings on Enron's bonds to junk status by the time Dynegy made its announcement.
    The loss of investment-grade credit forces some $3.9 billion in debts to off-balance sheet partnerships to come due immediately, a major problem for a company that has spent most of the $5.5 billion it sought in recent weeks to stay afloat.
    It became increasingly clear, as Dynegy sought to renegotiate the deal, that Enron's complex and often indecipherable financial books were becoming a sticking point, sources close to the negotiations said.
    "While it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in difficulties, this does not reflect a failure of the merchant energy business," Dynegy Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said in a statement.
    Dynegy said it would exercise its option to buy Enron's Northern Natural Gas Pipeline with the $1.5 billion it and partner ChevronTexaco <CHV.X> put into the deal.
    A bad sign came earlier on Wednesday, as energy traders said operations had stopped at Enron's once highly lucrative online trading system, EnronOnline. The unit accounted for up to 90 percent of Enron's earnings, and was considered the jewel of the trading franchise that Dynegy coveted most in its planned $9.3 billion all-stock takeover.
    Enron, which touted itself as an agile risk manager, found its credit and debt had spiraled out of control as a series of partnerships designed to hide debt off of its balance sheet caused investors to lose faith in recent weeks.
    The partnerships, which included top Enron executives and are the subject of a U.S. Securities and Exchange investigation, provided financing in exchange for guarantees that Enron's stock stay above certain levels and its credit remain investment-grade.
    Enron shares plunged $2.95, or 71.3 percent, to $1.19, before the New York Stock Exchange halted trading ahead of Dynegy's announcement. They have fallen more than 98 percent this year.
    The stock peaked at $90.56 in August 2000, riding high on the cresting wave of the technology boom after Enron took its trading outfit online and promised to bring its business model into the broadband communications arena.
    "They (Enron) entrapped the sophisticates," said Robert Stovall, senior strategist at Prudential Securities, referring to what was once an almost fawning admiration for Enron by institutional investors. "I think this is going to become a classic case."
    Stovall, with nearly 50 years of working on Wall Street, said he could not recall any previous corporate unravelling that matches that of Enron.
    "You would have to go to pre-SEC days for that," he said, referring to the creation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the aftermath of the stock-market crash of 1929.

Subject:	NetcoOnline Launch Plans


We are getting ready for the launch of "NetcoOnline" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case:

Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch "NetCoOnline".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of "NetCoOnline" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of "NetcoOnline"

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, "NetcoOnline" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

Certain individuals in the Trading and Origination groups will be contacting customers on our Top 50 list to introduce the new company and begin the process of getting signed PA's. The NetcoOnline marketing team will work with Trading and Origination groups to make sure that all Master Users that previously had EnronOnline North American Gas and Power execution rights are contacted within one week of the PA and ETA being approved by the new buyer.  NetcoOnline Marketing will follow up with the Master Users to make sure PA's are signed and returned.

Good Morning,

EPE has agreed to pay a scheduling fee for all MWh we schedule for them and prepare on their sheet.  Greg Wolfe has included language in the contract that all deals we do directly with them need to be adjusted by .25 in our favor for scheduling fees.

Please talk to me if you have any questions about our new EPE scheduling deal, it is going to cause some changes on this side of the row.

Real Time deals typically don't get confirmed; however, Chris Foster's generation customers have requested that we confirm their deals, whether day-ahead or hour-ahead.

For us, this means we need to pay special attention to the box marked "Confirmation" when entering deals. I know you're all in the habit of marking "No" under this designation, so review the following counterparty names carefully and commit them to memory, because deals with these generators NEED TO BE CONFIRMED. 

	Harbor Cogeneration
	Delano Energy
	Atlantic Richfield Co.
	Sierra Forest Products
	Wheelabrator Martell
	Wheelabrator Shasta
	Sierra Pacific Holding Co.
	Gas Recovery Systems
	East Bay MUD

Attached is a list of these counterparty names and corresponding contact information. Feel free to print this out and keep it in a nearby notebook.

Please let Chris or me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate

Holden -
Can you take a look at this itinerary and see if it looks OK.  
If you want to change anything let me know.  

Also the Travel Agency said they didn't have a profile for you 
on file.  Does your AMEX card end with 41005?  If so then we have
the correct information for your card.

Good morning to all of you at Enron.
 
I wanted to make you all aware of two major new capabilities that FriedWire is soon to deploy.  One will be the new PJM intelligence module that will be an add-on to the existing Traffic Report.  The other is a brand new version of the Traffic Report itself that incorporates real-time electricity prices and news/commentary from THE major provider of this content.  FriedWire will be making some announcements shortly describing the strategic alliance between our firm and this content partner, and should be able to start showing the enhanced, jointly developed version of the Traffic Report in October.
 
Regarding the PJM module; we are now scheduling 30-40 minute, remote (Internet-based) overviews with clients who actively trade in PJM.  These will begin the week of September 24th.  If any of you or your colleagues would like to participate in a very informal session that looks at the capabilities of this new tool, please contact me and I can help set-up a date and time.  Some of the content and functionality in the PJM module includes:
 
}         Real time price and load charts that present current conditions in historical context
}         Real-time and day-ahead LMP data along with the public FTR data to provide a real-time estimate of FTR value
}         Easy interface for querying FTR data to provide competitive intelligence in the primary and secondary FTR markets
}         Tools for valuing FTRs in the monthly FTR auction
}         PJM load charts displaying PJM ISO load forecast bias
}         Eastern Interconnect frequency monitoring
}         LMP charts and maps
}         Customizable displays in the form of personalized Watchlists, tables and chart building tools
 
Thanks and contact me with anything you might need.
 
Take Care, 
 
Stuart Wright
Director
FriedWire Inc.

Good Morning,

In case you haven't heard, Enron's shipping me back to Houston to help lead a few new systems projects for the Ontario & PJM open access markets.  I wanted to thank everyone for all the help and fun times over the last 15 months.  My wife Carol and I have completely enjoyed our time in Portland and hope to make it back some day.  I hope I can still stay involved with you guys in the future working through the IT developers here in Portland.  Please look me up if you are ever in Houston.  My last day in the Portland office will be Wednesday, October 10.

Thanks,  David Poston

Always ensure you do not launch attachments or web links received from people you do not know. 

Always ensure that you do not access/launch/download any attachments from external (web-based) email service providers while you are using the Enron network.

Detection + Prevention = Protection!

I called 1-800-297-3276 and navigated thru the automated menu.

Someone came on line and helped me, the confirmed my point balance and and asked me what I wanted to get.  I told them and they did it on the spot.

They also referred me to this website

www.americanexpress.com/rewards

I am not suggesting a course of action, but rather relaying my experience

Good Afternoon,

We have just completed the first part of the application requested this afternoon that will zero-out the schedule strip volumes for deals selected through this new program.  The program I am sending you now only selects deals.  The ability to zero-out the schedules will be available in about an hour.  However, we want to get the program out to you guys as soon as possible so that you can find any potential bugs.

Thanks,  David Poston

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

West Power
On August 31, 2001, West Power Origination closed the sale of 100% of the membership interests in Southwest Power to Black Hills Energy Corp.  The sale to Black Hills concluded a two year strategy associated with the acquisition and expansion of the 50MW Las Vegas Cogeneration facility.   The 230MW Las Vegas II expansion project initiated in January 2000 consists of two, 2x1 systems utilizing LM 6000 PC technology in combined cycle. In May of this year, West Power Origination secured a 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply Company for the entire output of the expansion project.  The Las Vegas II expansion project is currently under construction and is scheduled to go commercial in September 2002.  This transaction utilized many of Enron's technical, financial and commodity capabilities.  Congratulations to everyone who made it a success.  

Enron Freight Markets
Enron Freight Markets closed its first firm sale of transportation with Penske Logistics. Penske is under contract for the operation and U.S. distribution of Whirlpool appliances.

News from the Global Flash

EES Europe Celebrates Pirelli Deal
EES Europe is celebrating another deal with an attractive brand name after clinching a three-year contract with Pirelli Cables and Systems, the world's leading energy cable manufacturer. The deal gives EES the right to match bids to supply gas and electricity to 18 manufacturing sites in Italy and the UK. EES will also assess opportunities for energy management programmes designed to increase energy efficiency at Pirelli's facilities.

Bob Manasse, Vice President Origination of EES Europe, said: "Congratulations to all those involved for securing EES another great deal which will strengthen our position in Europe and give us a valuable point of entry into the Pirelli tire organization and the recently acquired Telecom Italia."

German Gas Deal - First Municipality Transaction Signed in BEB Territory 
Congratulations are due to the Frankfurt and London-based gas teams who, in the face of tough competition from the Northern German incumbent supplier, BEB Erdgas and Erdoel (a jointly held Shell and Exxon subsidiary), succeeded in securing two gas supply agreements with the cities of Peine and Uelzen on 24th August. Securing transmission will be challenging due to the fact that BEB has the most onerous grid access terms in Germany. However, the gas team is hopeful these transactions will bring about a turning point in gaining access to customers within BEB's territory, which until Enron closed on these deals was considered to be the "heart land" of Germany. 

Enron Names New UK Coal-Hauling Freight Locomotive
On Saturday, 1st September, a ten-strong delegation from Enron's coal team traveled up to British Energy's Eggborough coal-fired power station to take part in the naming ceremony for a newly-acquired Class 66 freight locomotive, recently put into service by Enron business partner and rail freight specialist, Freightliner Heavy Haul.   Enron and Freightliner Heavy Haul signed a contract for UK coal transport in June 2000, effectively breaking the local monopoly in the rail transport of coal held by an incumbent rail freight company.  True to form, the introduction of competition has reduced rates and dramatically improved service levels.

Stuart Staley, Enron's international coal group vice-president, praised the dedication of the Freightliner train drivers and staff who have contributed to the success of the service for Enron. While Eddie Fitzsimons, managing director of Freightliner Heavy Haul Ltd noted:  'We only started running coal trains in December 2000 and we have now run more than 17,000 individual wagon journeys containing more than one million tonnes of coal, almost all of that for Enron.'

The coal team selected the name Don Raider from numerous entries received from an earlier Globalflash competition:  "The new locomotive was named Don Raider, after the river Don, a major river in South Yorkshire where a number of our customers are located," explains Tom Kearney, a director in Enron's international coal group who executed the original deal with Freightliner.  "Other "Raider Class" Freightliner Heavy Haul locomotives will be named at a later date, each bearing the name of a river which flows near to coal-fired power stations and major coal-importing ports."  

While mischievous Enron employees may think the name sounds suspiciously like a covert activity carried out by the new market entrants, we can assure you that would simply be speculation!   Congratulations again to the Coal team on securing this landmark deal.

In order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of EnronOnline we are rolling out several changes tonight, which will be in effect on Monday August 20, 2001. Some of these changes will affect Stack Manager while others affect the Website. A summary of these changes is listed below.

Stack Manager Changes

Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a " Top of Stack Entry" it will create back to back transactions; one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.

In order to turn on this functionality select the " Allowed Top of Stack" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the "Allowed"  option should be selected.

Please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out.

Restricted Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a " Top of Stack Entry" it will create back to back transactions one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.

In order to turn on this functionality select the " allowed as Restricted Top of Stack" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the "Allowed"  option should be selected. If a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the "Restricted Top of Stack" feature.

Advanced Filtering Ability on All Products Tab -  Drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the All Products tab in stack manager. In order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title. A drop down box with a list of attributes will appear. Highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter. To turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the " All" option from the drop down box.


Website Changes

New Submission Screen for Restricted Top of Stack Limit Orders -  The submission screen for  products that allow  Top of Stack or Restricted Top of Stack limit orders is as follows.
 

The submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction, while the button on the right will submit as a limit order.  In case of the Restricted Top of Stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box. 

Price of Limit Orders 

Modify Limit Orders
 Customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order. In order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on  at the top of the "Today's Orders" section. The price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product. Once the price is at the desired level click the "Set" button and the price will be modified. Another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order.  You will see a box with plus, minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order.

Expiration time for Limit Orders
Customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days. Currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours.

Float the Today's Orders Section
You can now float the " Limit Order " section. In order to do so, right click in the "Today's Orders " section and select the float window option. In order to make the window " Stay On Top " right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option.

Mid Market Client - Mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers, while including their desired margin on the trade, on EnronOnline products. In order to do so Click on the bid or offer price, a customised submission window will appear.  Select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit. For example if a customer wants to buy Nymex Sep 01 at 3.36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin, please enter 3.36 as the desired price and 0.01 as the margin. The system will trade the order when the EnronOnline offer for Nymex Sep 01 is at 3.35, book the trade at 3.36 and record the 0.01 origination amount.

Bids Open for Enron Trading Unit
By KRISTEN HAYS, Associated Press Writer 
HOUSTON (AP) - A U.S. bankruptcy judge has set in motion the bidding process for embattled Enron Corp.'s once-dominant trading operation, which some Wall Streets insiders say could fetch up to $1 billion. 
Enron said at a hearing Wednesday before Judge Arthur Gonzalez in New York that it would allow parties to bid for all or part of the wholesale trading unit. 
Enron lawyer Martin J. Bienenstock said none of the 14 potential bidders to come forward so far have expressed interest in bidding for Enron's book of contracts, which Enron values at $5 billion to $7 billion. 
Bids are due Jan. 7; an auction will be held Jan. 10. 
Bienenstock said bidders are wary of the potential liabilities in the contracts and that the short time frame does not allow for a full review of the books. The company, however, wants to complete the auction as soon as possible to avoid losing traders to other financial companies. 
In Enron's home base of Houston Wednesday, a federal judge ruled that a state court should decide whether Enron must give rival Dynegy Inc. a key natural gas pipeline. 
Dynegy claims Enron signed away its right to Northern Natural Gas Co. pipeline, a prized 16,500-mile system running between Texas and the Midwest, in exchange for $1.5 billion invested in Enron before a proposed merger of the two competitors collapsed in late November. 
Enron claims its smaller rival illegally terminated the $8.4 billion deal and therefore has no right to the pipeline. Enron and had argued that Dynegy's claim should be part of Enron's massive bankruptcy case filed in federal court in New York. 
U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon ruled that Dynegy's suit should be heard in state court because the company's claim was not a core element of the bankruptcy. Harmon noted that Dynegy could have sued Enron if the former energy giant didn't seek Chapter 11 protection. 
``It's what we predicted,'' said David Burns, a lawyer representing Dynegy in the lawsuit. ``If we don't have Northern Natural Gas turned over to us promptly, we will ask the court to provide an accelerated trial date on this.'' 
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined comment on the decision. 
Dynegy sued Enron in Texas state court in Houston the day after Enron filed one of the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcies in U.S. history Dec. 2 and sued Dynegy for $10 billion for breach of contract in New York. 
Dynegy and other creditors also have asked that the bankruptcy case be moved to Houston, where Enron, Dynegy and many of Enron's 800 or so creditors are based. Gonzalez will consider those requests Jan. 7. 
Also Wednesday, nearly 40 of some 4,500 Enron employees laid off after the company filed for bankruptcy gathered outside Enron headquarters here to discuss the company's severance policy and sign a complaint to Enron on the lack of information. 
Some carried signs that displayed the word ``Moron'' under Enron's logo and said ``What were they thinking?'' Others wore T-shirts that said ``The Execs Who Stole Christmas.'' 
Gonzalez on Dec. 4 $1.5 billion in short-term financing to keep the company afloat and fund $4,500 severance payments. 
Former workers received those checks last week, but revelations that nearly 600 employees deemed critical to Enron's survival received more than $100 million in retention payments upset those entitled to more money under Enron's severance policy, they said. 
The company's severance policy says eligible workers are entitled to a week's pay for each full or partial year of employment and another week's pay for each $10,000 they earned in salary, up to a maximum of 26 weeks. 
``We would like the company to honor its commitment,'' said Pete Chase, 31, who worked for Enron Energy Services for 18 months. 
Denne said the company cannot approve any severance payments above $4,500 for each employee without Gonzalez' approval. Employees can file claims with the judge for more severance pay. Instructions on how to do so are available on Enron's Web site (www.enron.com). 
``The next step for Enron is for its creditors to assess its financial condition and assets,'' Denne said. ``Every employee is absolutely free to file a claim.'' 
Enron, formerly No. 7 on the Fortune 500 with stock trading near $90 a year ago, plummeted into bankruptcy after revelations of hidden debt and overstated earnings in October siphoned investor confidence and prompted traders to flee from what was once the world's largest buyer and seller of natural gas. 
Dynegy abandoned a plan to buy Enron for $8.4 billion when it continued to reveal serious financial problems and Enron's credit was downgraded to junk. 
Dynegy shares rose $3.08 to close at $23.98 on the New York Stock Exchange. Enron shares were down 6 cents to 44 cents, also on the NYSE.

>From Enron Corp Business Controls


Operations in Enron's Crisis Management Center will cease at the close of business in Houston on September 12.  All inquiries or information pertaining to the events of the last two days should now be directed to Enron Corp Business Controls at 713.345.2804.  In the event immediate assistance is required after hours, the Business Controls telephone number will be answered by the 24x7 security desk which can have a representative from Business Controls return your call immediately.

With respect to employees stranded around the United States, we regret that these employees should make their way back to Houston or their home office as best they can via commercial airlines, train, or rental car.  Unfortunately, corporate and other private aircraft will not be flying until sometime after restrictions are lifted on commercial carriers.  Therefore, Enron corporate aircraft should not be counted on to provide assistance in this situation.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

EES Europe Lands First Outsourcing Deal
Congratulations to EES Europe who recently clinched their first outsourcing=
 transaction with supermarket giant, Sainsbury's.  The deal means EES will =
provide gas and electricity to all 493 Sainsbury's properties in the UK inc=
luding stores, offices and depots. EES will also manage a program of energy=
 reduction measures designed to improve energy efficiency at Sainsbury's fa=
cilities.

Stuart Rexrode, Vice President of EES Europe, said: "This was a sensational=
 team effort - a fantastic achievement for EES Europe and a truly groundbre=
aking transaction in the marketplace.  The whole group should all be extrem=
ely proud and I am confident that this is the start of many more outsourcin=
g deals to come."

EBS Europe
EBS Europe has just completed its 100th transaction. The transaction involv=
es a 12-month contract for an STM-4 circuit from London to Madrid. This cap=
acity is equivalent to approximately 830 DSL lines or Internet connections =
into the home.  Commenting on the achievement, Matthew Scrimshaw, President=
 of EBS Europe said, "This is just one of the many milestones that EBS will=
 achieve, as we continue to create a market for bandwidth trading and origi=
nation."

Pioneering International Coal Agreements Signed
Enron has signed a five-year agreement with Spanish utility HidroElectrica =
del Cantabrico for the import of at least 600,000 tonnes of steam coal per =
annum in Enron's first long-term coal import deal into Spain.  The agreemen=
t gives Enron full optionality with regard to sourcing, timing and quantity=
 of coal supply, which will be delivered via the port of Gijon in northern =
Spain and transported by rail and truck to a number of coal-fired power sta=
tions, predominantly in the north of the country.  Gijon itself could becom=
e a trading hub for Spain's rapidly expanding coal market. "Spain is experi=
encing strong demand growth for electricity generation and with an annual p=
roduction of only 17 million tonnes of expensive, low-quality coal at its d=
isposal, the country has a need for new, flexible sources of supply - so th=
ere's lots of opportunity for us to extend the scope of our agreement," say=
s Sam Grossman, Enron's coal group director who led the team which included=
 Katrina Bensadon and Janet Wood with support from the coal and freight tea=
ms.

In a separate agreement Enron's first foray into the US coal import market =
is delivering a cargo of Colombian coal to Dynergy via the Mississippi and =
two further cargoes of 45,000-60,000 tonnes to northeastern US utilities vi=
a Charleston, south Carolina.  With coal supplying the fuel for more than h=
alf of the USA's power generation and the domestic coal market showing high=
 prices - the Nymex coal price has doubled over the past year - this is an =
excellent time for Enron to help meet customer demand.  "This is a classic =
Enron deal exploiting optionality," says Sam Grossman.  "We were able to re=
direct one of our coal cargoes bound for Europe and find an alternative sou=
rce to fulfill the European order."  The import agreement is expected to en=
courage other counterparties into the US coal import market.  Congratulatio=
ns to Sam, Peter Bradley, Lenny Hochschild and the Enron freight desk.

To our customers and counterparts:

As of Sunday, November 18 our OASIS and E-tag servers are running on PPT.
The only business practices we are changing now, is that our OASIS
transmission products are all based upon PPT.  Our scheduling system/e-tag
server is also running on PPT.  However, we can and will continue to accept
e-tags in any timezone, as long as the profile has a valid OASIS
reservation.  We will also continue to check out with our counterparties in
the time zone that we have historically used with each neighboring control
area.  

The cost?  $4.79 for a tall, skinny latte' and a plain bagel with light
cream cheese for our programmer.

If you have any questions, please give me a call at 208-388-2243.

Thanks,

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
On Friday, June 22, Enron Industrial Markets closed Project Slapshot.  Project Slapshot emerged as Enron's solution to efficiently fund the Stadacona newsprint mill acquisition outside of the highly priced and restrictive pulp and paper capital and bank markets.  The primary goals were to 1) obtain low cost financing, 2) retain flexibility of the assets, and 3) minimize credit impact.  

Through the use of a derivatives package consisting of a warrant, a put, and a total return swap, EIM was able to redirect lenders exposure from operating, asset and commodity price risk to Enron credit risk. Consequently, our debt financing costs fell by over 400 bps.  Unlike other pulp and paper producers constrained by debt and operating covenants, EIM now has a significantly lower cost of capital plus the flexibility with its physical assets so that it may continue to revolutionize the pulp and paper industry without being burdened by restrictions typical in the industry. 

To alleviate the credit impact of purchasing a cyclical operating asset, we utilized our partnership with Citigroup, "Sundance," to spread some of the asset risk so that the acquisition would have minimal credit impact.  The credit derivatives package, together with the Sundance partnership, effectively enabled EIM to acquire its physical newsprint supply without bearing the heavy capital costs typically associated with this industry.  


Enron Freight Markets
On June 20, Enron Freight Markets (EFM) closed its first two major origination transactions; one with Werner Enterprises of Omaha, NE and the other with Covenant Transport, Inc of Chattanooga, TN.  Each deal was for the purchase of firm, over the road truckload capacity for a one-year term in the following lanes:

Los Angeles, CA to Oakland, CA
Los Angeles, CA to Chicago, IL
Los Angeles, CA to Columbus, OH
Los Angeles, CA to Newark, NJ
Oakland, CA to Chicago, IL
Chicago, IL to Atlanta, GA
Chicago, IL to Newark, NJ
Atlanta, GA to Newark, NJ

Shipments will commence Monday, July 2 with one truck leaving from each city each weekday.   After a three-week ramp up period, the volume will increase to as many as 3 trucks per city, per day.  

Each of the contracts also contains two options.  The first is Enron's right to extend the term for up to an additional twelve months.  The other is Enron's right to double the aggregate capacity for a period of 30 days up to 1 year.  EFM's Long Term Capacity Agreement represents a new approach to purchasing freight capacity in the transportation industry.  The firmness of the contract is a significant step in moving the industry from typical relationship -based contracts to more commodity-like contracts that allow buyers and sellers to explicitly value risk. 

Cuiaba & the Boliva Brasil Pipeline - Enron wins Award!
The first week in June, the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) presented Enron and Ken Lay an award for the seminal work the company has done with the WCS in Bolivia on conservation activities.  This included work on the Bolivia Brasil Pipeline, the Cuiaba lateral and the efforts concerning the Chiquitano Conservation program.  Congratulations to everyone involved!

IN THE NEWS

A Hand In Everything Enron Gets Rich In California.  But Has It Gouged Consumers?
"Enron has reinvented the energy business, fashioning itself into something closer to a brokerage than a power provider.  Formed in 1985 out of the junk bond merger of two old-line natural gas pipeline companies, Enron pushed relentlessly for deregulation, first in the natural gas business and later in electricity.  From the trading floors of its towering Houston office building, it rivals any Wall Street firm in sophisticated deal making." -- U.S. News and World Report, June 18

A Developmentor manager has an introductory VB class locally that he is trying to fill.  I took a COM+/2000 class from them in December, and they are first class.  How many of us would be interested (no commitment at this point)?
 
I believe this is Developmentor's 12/3 one-week course (see  <http://www.develop.com/dm/course.asp?id=10>)  It ordinarily goes for $1800 per person.
 
Mike N, can you give me some guidance regarding how much cost per person or how much cost total you would be prepared to pay.  Again, he is trying to fill up a class that is about to be cancelled, and I think he would be willing to negotiate.
 
Tim, would you or anyone on your floor have any interest in this?
 
Michael

Enron Benefit Plans 
Summary Annual Report    

The basic financial and insurance information on the back of this page, as well as the material below, provide a Summary Annual Report for the Enron Benefit Plans.  The annual report for each plan has been filed with the Internal Revenue Service, as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). 

NOTE:  You may receive a report for a benefit plan in which you are not a participant or under which you are not entitled.  Entitlement to benefits under any of the plans is based on the provisions of each plan.


Your Rights to Additional Information

You have the right to receive, upon request, a copy of the full annual report, or any part thereof, for any plan.  For insured plans, insurance information (including any sales commissions paid by insurance carriers) is shown in the annual reports.

To obtain a copy of the full annual report, or any part thereof, for any plan, write or call:

Enron Corp Shareholder Relations
1400 Smith Street
Houston, TX  77002-7311

(713) 853-6161

You also have the right to receive from the plan administrator, on request and at no charge, a statement of the assets and liabilities of the plan and accompanying notes, or a statement of income and expenses of the plan and accompanying notes, or both.  If you request a copy of the full annual report from the plan administrator, these two statements and accompanying notes will be included as part of that report.

You also have the legally protected right to examine the annual report at the main office of the plan (Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX  77002-7311) and at the U.S. Department of Labor in Washington, D.C., or to obtain a copy from the U.S. Department of Labor upon payment of copying costs.

All,
    
We have seen some symptoms of problems with the voicemail system.
 
The Problem:
The Message Waiting Indicator (MWT) on the Meridian phones is not lighting for several hours after new messages are received.
 
What we are doing about it:
I have contacted PGE Telephone Services and they have opened a trouble ticket to have the problem looked into.
 
The workaround:
If you are expecting messages or if you have not checked your messages in a while because you have not seen the MWT light, please proactively check your voicemail box by dialing x7600, hit the # key for you mailbox, and enter your password.
 
I will send out an update message when I have more news.
 
Regards

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Weather Risk Management
The Weather Desk is please to announce the completion of a large transactio=
n in Europe designed to protect construction workers from lost wages on day=
s when construction is halted due to adverse weather conditions.  Enron com=
pleted this deal with a European bank that in turn is selling this protecti=
on to a fund manager for construction workers. Under the terms of this tran=
saction, Enron will pay the bank when the number of "frost days" reaches a =
predetermined amount outlined in the contract. Frost days are calculated wh=
en the hourly temperature falls below the strike temperature. This innovati=
ve transaction is the first of its kind and presents many possibilities for=
 future contracts with companies whose earnings are dependent on the weathe=
r.

This transaction originated in the London office and was structured in the =
Houston office. Please call Sandeep Ramachandran at (713) 853-0964, Paul Mu=
rray at +44 (207) 783-4769 or Sanjeev Khanna at (713) 853-3849 for further =
information.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH


Update on France=20
During 2001 the French team has traded 30 TWh of power and closed about 2,4=
00 bilateral trades with various counterparties (26 trading counterparties =
and 9 origination counterparties, including French industrials). This is a =
huge 3,000% increase compared to last year, making France the second larges=
t power trading market in the Continent. Since French power was launched on=
 EnronOnline in April 2001 it has seen more than 800 trades totaling 4TWh, =
and so far Enron is the only company to trade French power online as a mark=
et-maker.  We currently quote online Peak and Baseload products, day-ahead,=
 weak-ahead, month-ahead, calendar years 2002, and 2003.=20

Power trading conditions have significantly improved in France since the Fr=
ench grid operator (RTE) introduced Programme Responsible Contracts at the =
end of 2000, allowing counterparties to trade blocks on the grid. Liquidity=
 has been increasing dramatically, as RTE has created an intra-day market, =
and has auctioned interconnector capacity, notably France-UK, and France-It=
aly.   Also the EC has asked EdF to auction 6,000MW of virtual capacity pro=
ducts, and Enron successfully participated in the first 1,200MW auction in =
September.  Enron will also participate in the Powernext spot exchange mark=
et for 1MW day-ahead peak and baseload products, along with 12 French and f=
oreign counterparties, when it is launched in early November.  A balancing =
market showing referenced market prices for balancing services in France is=
 expected to be implemented Q1 2002.

France's size and geographical position will make it a natural hub for trad=
ing on the Continent. The increase of physical, but also financial trading,=
 the sale of more Interconnector capacity and VPP products, and improved fu=
ture market mechanisms will contribute to the further development of the ma=
rket.=20

Congratulations to the French Team for this tremendous success!

Enron Signs Ground-Breaking Coal Deals in Korea and China
In a landmark deal, Enron has become the first ever trading company to win =
a coal supply contract into Korea. This is a watershed event in the Pacific=
 market, as all previous Korean coal tenders have required mine ownership f=
or participation.  Japanese industry newsletter Tex Report noted the signif=
icance of this event, writing: "This is the first supply by Enron to one of=
 the electric utilities of South Korea.  Taking this opportunity, Enron see=
ms to be planning to commence thermal coal exports in earnest to the Asian =
region, including Japan, from now on."  Under the contract, Enron's coal te=
am will deliver 250,000 tonnes of steam coal to Korea Southern Power Ltd, o=
ne of the five semi-autonomous generating companies created when the nation=
al company, KEPCO, split up last year.  Coal Group Vice President Stuart St=
aley said, "Same trend, different country.  As we've learned in Europe and =
the US, electricity deregulation necessitates change in fuel procurement pr=
actices.  Korea is one of the world's largest markets for sea-borne steam c=
oal, and this seems to mark the beginning of a fundamental change in their =
approach."=20

In a related deal, Enron has signed a multi-year purchase agreement with Ya=
nkuang Group, a major Chinese mining company.  This coal will not only be u=
sed to meet Enron's Asian supply obligations (including the Korean deal abo=
ve), but some of it may even reach Europe as a result of plummeting freight=
 rates.  Sydney-based Manager Jez Peters said, "This is big. China is going=
 to be the single largest factor affecting the international coal market, a=
nd this deal, along with our relationships with the other major Chinese exp=
orters, gives us great strategic placement." =20

Enron's European Weather Risk Management Team Signs Biggest-Ever Weather De=
rivatives Deal in Europe =20
Enron's European weather risk management team led by Paul Murray has sold a=
 five-year call option to a Dutch counterparty in Europe's largest ever wea=
ther derivatives transaction - which to Enron is worth a total of 50 millio=
n Dutch guilders (USD 20,600,000) in notional value.  A handful of other we=
ather derivatives traders were known to have gained pieces of the deal.  Th=
e overall transaction, brokered by ABN Amro, is a capital markets transacti=
on on behalf of a Dutch company which is hedging itself against 'frost days=
' when the weather is too cold for construction workers to be able to do an=
y building work - but still need to be paid - as is their right under Dutch=
 law.

The counterparty, which does not wish to be named, examined a number of alt=
ernatives to hedge their risk before deciding that a weather derivative wou=
ld suit their purposes best.  This indicates just how robust the European w=
eather market has become as a year ago a deal such as this was just would n=
ot have been possible."

Enron Signs Swiss Trading Joint Venture =20
On 1 October 2001 ewz, Switzerland's leading municipal power company of Zur=
ich, and Enron announced the creation of a trading joint venture that will =
be located in Zurich and will go into operation at the end of October 2001.=
=20

The JV will be equally managed by ewz and Enron and will focus on electrici=
ty trading, portfolio management and power plant optimization in the wholes=
ale markets in Switzerland and neighboring countries.  The JV combines ewz'=
s long-established extensive knowledge of the Swiss market and Enron's trad=
ing and risk management expertise.=20

"This is a groundbreaking deal for Enron on the continent as the JV will be=
 an ideal platform for additional partnerships in Switzerland and abroad. T=
his venture is also highly valuable because it will allow Enron to enter in=
to complex deals based on the JV's hydro-production/pump storage capabiliti=
es and intraday trading," said Peter Kreuzberg who is commercially in charg=
e of the risk and optimization aspects of the JV.

Although Switzerland has no energy law yet, the market is extremely importa=
nt on the continent because of its central location between Europe's larges=
t net exporter - France -- and its largest net importer - Italy - and its p=
osition south of Germany, which has the most liquid market. "Switzerland's =
large interconnector capacities makes it the ideal geographical location fo=
r trading," said Peter Heydecker, who will be Enron's co-CEO in the new JV.=
  "Most importantly, this JV will build trust towards Enron in the market a=
nd will make us part of the 'the 'inner circle of the utility club'."

This deal was the result of a great team effort, with substantial contribut=
ions from Lars Athenhofer, Michael Schuh, Mauro Renggli, Martin Bloch and C=
rispin Leick.

Dry Bulk Freight Group Steaming Ahead
Enron's global dry bulk freight group, headquartered in the London office, =
trades physical shipping freight capacity for dry commodities such as steel=
, iron ore, grain and coal as well as offering financial derivatives to hel=
p counterparties manage their risk exposure to this volatile market.  Physi=
cal and financial freight capacity is bought and sold as either 'time chart=
er' (think 'car hire for ships') or 'voyage contract' (more like a sea taxi=
 service).  Enron is the only true market maker in 'Forward Freight Agreeme=
nts' (shipping options) and trades both on the phone and through EnronOnlin=
e.

The growth of the group's traded volumes has been exponential. From a stand=
ing start in April 2000, the team has now traded more than 25 million tonne=
s of physical freight capacity with more than 40 million tonnes in OTC trad=
e ytd (2001).  Compare this to six million tonnes OTC the year before.  To =
help drive this growth the team has grown over the past 12 months to a tota=
l of 5 commercial people.

The group expects to top 120 million tonnes of total freight contracts trad=
ed (physical and financial) by year-end. Among an increasing number of new =
counter parties are the likes of RWE, EDF trading, TXU, Innogy, EON, Billit=
on, BHP and RAG.

Innovations being launched by the dry bulk team include:
Floating rate contracts for ship-owners, which are very attractive in the c=
urrent flat market, as rates are expected to pick up next year.
Pooling the requirements of ship-owners and cargo-owners that allow both gr=
oups to optimise their physical flows while decoupling them from price risk=
.=20
Interchangeability on time charter contracts, which allows owners to change=
 ship during an existing contract route, which is one of the key routes.
Ad hoc structures based on freight derivatives for financial institutions.

"All these new initiatives are designed to increase flexibility for our cou=
nterparties and drive liquidity into the shipping market," explains Pierre =
Aury, head of Enron's global dry bulk freight team.  "Our activities in the=
 dry bulk shipping sector present a classic example of how Enron's entry in=
to a historically inefficient market brings in new players, increases optio=
ns for trading, reduces transaction costs and of course, generates new reve=
nue streams for both ourselves and our customers."

AT noon o'clock PST I will need to ask that everyone please get out of CAPS 97 for routine maintenance. The historical and settlement databases will NOT be affected. The purpose for this maintenance will be to help with the locking issue that we have been experiencing lately. Could you let the rest of the people in your department, who will be affected by this, know that they will need to get out of CAPS at noon. Also, if this is going to be a MAJOR problem for anyone, please let me know so that I may be able to try to work out something different.

While there are a few people who are still making up their minds, the rest =
of the people in our office will be working for the Enron estate.  It is no=
t entirely clear to me right now what the management team for west power lo=
oks like for the Enron estate now.  As I understand it, there are two prima=
ry initiatives on the estate side that people in Portland may be a part of.=
  The first is the disposition of our development projects that are already=
 well under way.  Dave Parquet in San Francisco has been leading this effor=
t together with the Portland asset development team.  This effort has been =
ongoing since December.  The second is the disposition of our west power co=
mmodity positions.  Jim Fallon is in charge of this for the entire company.=
  People working on this for Jim include Don Miller, Paul Racicot, Brad Ric=
hter, Ed Baughman among others.  I have placed a call to Jim and to Paul to=
 get advice on how people in Portland should proceed.  I would recommend ta=
lking to Ed, Brad, Paul, or Don to get direction.  I have placed a call to =
several of these people to get direction and am waiting for a response.  I =
am hopeful that they will designate a lead person in Portland to coordinate=
 the power procurement and delivery efforts.

As most of you know, the physical separation between UBS Warburg and Enron =
has already begun.  People who will continue to work for Enron will be loca=
ted on the 4th Floor, while UBS Warburg will occoupy the 3rd Floor.  We hop=
e to make the moves to the 4th Floor by the end of this week.  Moves within=
 the 3rd Floor will take place the following week.

The UBS Warburg transaction is subject to one last pro forma regulatory hur=
dle.  While I don't have an exact date, I am told that it will likely be on=
 or about February 6th.

Finally, I want to once again thank everyone for their help and cooperation=
 over the last few weeks.  These have been really horrible times as the Enr=
on story continues to unfold in the news at the same time that people are f=
inding out about their future with Enron and UBS.  I know that this hasn't =
been easy for anyone.  I am deeply saddened overseeing the breakup of the a=
wesome team that we have put together.  Whether you are going to UBS, remai=
ning with Enron, or leaving the company, I wish everyone who worked on this=
 team the best in their future endeavors.  It has been a distinct honor to =
work with each and every one of you.

As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.

Organizational Matters
The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.

>From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

By now, you must have heard of "NETCO." This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.

As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.

Personnel Matters
As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.

Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp
Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.

Treasurer - Enron Corp
Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.

Corporate Development
Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.

Wholesale Services
The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.

Management Committee Departures
Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:

Michael Brown
Mark Frevert
Steve Kean
Mike McConnell
Jeff Shankman

Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.

We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.

Please note a new version of curve manager has been tested in the Stage environment which include below features:

1. We will be able to mark Swaption Volatility -- In the past (current version of curve manager you are using) we only have one set of volatility curves which is being applied to the calculations of both option and swaption deal types.  The new version of curve manager allow us the flexibility to more accurately mark volatility curves seperately for swaption deal type.  If you decided that you are not going to use this feature by not marking a seperate set of volatility for swaptions, our calculation system will by default use our option volatility curves.

2. In the past if you mark the long term (by month) price "change" column directly in the curve manager for certain month, the curve manager will automatically apply the same change to be the same price change for the same month in all other years.  In the new version, this "automatic" feature will be removed.  Please note if you mark long term curves by doing copy and paste from Excel rather than by marking the curve change directly in the curve manager, this "automatic" feature has not affected you in the past and will not affect you in the new version.

Risk has tested above changes to the curve manager successfully.  Please let us know as soon as possible if you have other concerns by Monday (10/22) or we will ask IT to release the new version.

Thanks,

Fran

Our new office supply house is Boise Cascade, and we just got the capability to place an order.  We plan to radically scale down the supplies we previously kept in stock, but we will maintain a rudimentary supply of the basics.  

If you need an office supply that is not typically stocked or if you would like to see the catalog, please ask Mollie or me.

	This message is for those of you with laptops.  We have had some problems with laptops being able to dial into the network using the modem since the upgrade to Outlook has taken place.  We believe that the installation of the Palm Pilots that happened at the same time is what has caused these problems.  

	For those of you with laptops that have not tested the ability to dial into the network using Ipass since the upgrade, please do so.  We have had a couple of people get stuck on the road with non functional modems and I want to try and catch the rest of you before you need the modem.  Please get with one of us in the IT dept to schedule time to help you test and or fix any problems you may have.

Thanks

Dave

As most people are aware, there are a variety of proceedings and investigations pertaining to the western wholesale power markets.  More than 50 market participants are involved in litigation on both the state and federal level.  We have no reason to believe that Enron has been singled out in any of these investigations.  

Each person in the Portland office needs to be aware of and comply with our data retention policies.  These policies are not new.  I have previously sent out e-mails delineating our policy.  This e-mail simply serves as a reminder.  

If you have any questions or concerns please let me know.


The purpose of this message is to update employees on the
status of the California Attorney General's order regarding the preservation
of business information.  Please NOTE THE IMPORTANT POLICIES DESCRIBED
BELOW.

Please continue to ahdere to the following business information retention policies:

(1) PERSONAL EMAIL: can be kept, discarded,
etc. at will.

(2) BUSINESS EMAIL: do not delete any
business email sent or received for 24 hours.  This 24 hour delay will allow
the network to save a backup copy of the email.  After 24 hours, BUSINESS
EMAIL may be kept, discarded, etc. at will.

(3) WORD PROCESSING FILES OR FILE FRAGMENTS:
do not delete any SAVED FILE or any FILE FRAGMENT.  This policy covers any
FILE or FILE FRAGMENT that you have saved on your hard disk or the network.

(4) DATABASES: do not delete any information
in DATABASES.

(5) EXCEL SPREADSHEETS: do not delete any
information in EXCEL SPREADSHEETS.

(6) CALENDARS OR SCHEDULING PROGRAMS: do not
delete any information.

(7) OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA: do not delete any
OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA.

(8) HARD DRIVE CAPACITY: in the event that
you run out of disk space on your personal computer, you may copy files to
the network (where they will be backed up), then delete the files from your
personal computer to create the work space you need.  DO NOT DELETE ANY FILE
BEFORE YOU HAVE COPIED IT TO THE NETWORK.


In our negotiations we have discovered no
reason to believe that Enron has been singled out for investigation by the
Attorney General.  We will update you as we learn more.

Thanks for your help in this matter.

Tim Belden

The following day ahead tag# 24395 for the 11th was denied by WACM because it was submitted after the 3:00pdt tag deadline.  Tag# 24365 was the predecessor and was approved by WACM.  Still, WACM refuses to approve TAG#24395.  Please copy this tag and submit it as a real-time schedule on the 11th.  Sorry for the inconvenience I received ZERO cooperation from the control areas.   Please check out with each control area when submitting the new tag.  Per Mary at WACM, I could not tag this schedule day ahead.  

Thanks,

Subject:	index option with index and delivery in different region

Hi Heather:

  Per our brief discussion last Friday, Alex asked me to put together a briefing on what research group thought was the easiest and reasonably accurate way to evaluate the index option when the index and delivery point were in different regions.

  Basically the research group think the option should be valued as a basis option for the whole period from the evaluation day to the expiration day, instead of for just one day ---- this is what we are doing in portcalc right now, except that the current evaluation is based on Craig vs. Rockie instead of Craig vs. PV.  The argument for that is that although the strike price won't be known till the last day, the whole price change process between today and then determines the final price.   I think Alex's example is quite eloquent:  say the basis difference between Craig and PV is zero today for 6/1/2002, it is very unlikely that the basis difference will still be zero on 5/31/2002.  If we evaluated as a one-day basis option whose basis price difference is one, the option value will be almost zero, and the option is underestimated.

  Put everything together, this is the suggested evaluation Research came up with:

  Underlying: forward hourly price for the expiration date in delivery region

  Strike: forward price for the delivery day in index region

  Time to expiration: time between evaluation date and expiration date.

  Alex and Zimin, please feel free to correct me if you find any error above.

  Thanks,

- Zhiyun

Please join the Real-Time Group in wishing Monika Causholli well as she moves into her new rotation with Enron Industrial Markets in Houston.  She has been an asset to the team over the past year and her skills will be missed.

The NWS winter outlook is finalized. I have provided a link. The NWS is basically bullish in the East and Southern Canada for cold weather while mild to bearish in most of the West temperature-wise. The precipitation forecast for the Pac NW Hydro Basins is regarded as "near normal" or 95-105%. 

Note - this is the first time in 10 winter seasons that the NWS is forecasting below normal temperatures from the Midwest into the Northwest for DEC to FEB. 

Also, the finalized versions of Earth Sat are in all of your drop boxes.

She missed the tax deduction for 2001, and she missed being a New Year's baby, but we'll probably keep her just the same.  Mom and baby are doing fine.  Dad is still assessing.

For those of you that were not on this weekend I would like to inform you of a new possibility for sales. Transalta buys at both SP 15 and Mead 230 in both cases they plan to export to Lugo/Victorville. Since they ask to buy this power transmission contingent we can wheel through the ISO from PV to Lugo (ISO ID LUGO_5_VICTVL). They will pay a premium to get the power at lugo and they will buy the power transmission contingent. Have fun with it.

As much as I'd like to, I can't get to every floor or to every location across Enron to talk with you about what is going on around the company.  So I'm doing the next best thing.  Beginning today, you can access a videotaped message from me about our second quarter results and our new strategy concerning Enron Broadband Services.  As you listen, I hope you find the information valuable and this new way of communicating easy and timely.  I plan to do this regularly, so watch your e-mail for future messages.  Thanks for listening and have a great day.

Holden see Scenario III for Demand Charge Frequency per MW/hr

Each strip is calculated.

demand charge per day = # of hours per day * demand charge volume in MW * demand charge price in $

So OffPeak would have 2 strips - one for HE1-6 and one for HE23-24

Does this help?  Let me know what we need to do w/ 707211.

The CARP IT people : hmmmm I don't know if they exist  - I got a kick out of that one!

Yes I do have a call into IT - they are working on a solution for CARP.
In the meantime when dealing with a Monthly Demand Charge - make sure only one strip contains the Demand Charge.
The reason we had the problem with April is because the system automatically created the 3 strips due to the time change.
So to avoid any problems until this has been fixed - if you have a deal with multiple strips - and have a Monthly Demand Charge / MW,
make sure only one strip has the Demand Charge Price entered.

I will keep you updated on this issue.
Let me know if you have any additional questions.

-Heather

They should be entered with the price in only one strip, however, once they fix CARP, we may not need to worry about this.......I'll let you know.  Heather has a call in to the CARP IT people.

Mark, Tom, and Holden,

In reference to the DPR impacts of $ 132,000 (WAPA) and $133,000 (SRP) that you were expecting, here is an explanation of why you will not be seeing that in your PMA's:

The 2 deals listed below were put in as a MW month, each with 3 strips in the deal separating out April 1, April 2, and the rest of the month.  The reason for the 3 strips was to catch the April 1 time change from PST to PDT.  

deal #  539126: 3 strips @ 2216 = 199,500 charge for the month in CARP (true value is - $66,500).
deal #  538832: 3 strips @ 2180 = 196,200 charge for the month in CARP (true value is - $65,400) .


Typically, I provide you with a report that tells you what $ amount to look for coming thru in your PMA's, according to the changes that I am making on the back end.  You then see the change in DPR come thru on a PMA report that Risk provides for you.  

When these deals hit Settlements, we recognized that the CARP was calculating both deals at 3 times their monthly value (and since we are purchasing, that is a negative three times against your books).  When the above + DPR impacts didn't come thru in your PMA's, we started looking at the deals to figure out why they didn't.


Here is a discription of the Risk - Settlements process:
Risk values a deal on the day of liquidation.  Any intra-month changes, even if they happen after the day of flow, get trued up by Risk and changed in the DPR.  Anything that gets changed after the end of the month, Settlements recognizes as a DPR variance and reports this to Risk and you see it affect your DPR as reported in the PMA report.

So the question was: When it came to recognizing a variance in Settlements, why weren't we seeing a + amount back to your books for 2 of the strips that I zero'd out? 

Houston Settlements looked into it and were seeing that these deals were originally valued at ($66,500) and ($65,400), even though CARP was showing that they were calculating at ($199,500) and ($196,200) ....

Heather Dunton and I did alot of searching for the answer and we found that:  When Risk flashed these deals in April, they flashed them according to a single MW month charge.  Regardless of how many strips there are, the deal is set up as a MW month and should, therefore, calculate as one single charge for the month. 

We found that CARP is reading these incorrectly and causing the confusion, (as I was seeing that the deals were calculating 3 times because that is how CARP and UNIFY were reading the deal). 

 The IT people in Houston are now working on fixing that glitch.

When it comes to DPR, your book originally recognized an impact of (66,500) and (65,400), which is correct.  Since your April DPR was correct, you will not see an adjustment in your PMA's.  

I recognize that this is not gratification for the + DPR impact that you were expecting and I apologize for the confusion and mis-information that I gave you in my report.  This has, however, helped us to hi-light a technical error that will save us alot of work in the future. 

Thanks for your patience while we figured this out.
Let me know if you have any questions.

 Thanks,

 Virginia

I do remember this deal, we were forced to bookout by some a-hole at pinwest because of the disaster and our inability to secure a scheule from DYPMI and Morgan who was upstream of AEP who was scheduling from home (as was I).  Tom  did the deal with Pinwest our buy for $40, and I did the deal with DYPMI our sale at Index.  I told the SW guys about this the following day, and in the mayhem, the deals probably did not get put in.  Holden and Tom and Mark were all aware of this at the time, and one of them may have also modified our deal with DYPMI.

They can throw those deals in, or I can.  Just let me know.

Cara,

I have a dispute  from Pinnacle West for Sept 12 at $40.  I've checked the sheets and the deal is in the sheet, but there is no deal number.  This leads me to believe that there isn't a deal in Enpower.  The deal is PV HV and Staci remembers the problem.    

Let me know when we can talk about this

 thanks

Hey Guys!

I went through all the templates and removed the RT prefix for all the templates. You can now sort them alphabetically making the process of finding the right template a lot easier. From now on please do no use the RT prefix when creating new templates.

As much as I'd like to, I can't get to every floor or to every location across Enron to talk with you about what is going on around the company.  So I'm doing the next best thing.  Beginning today, you can access a videotaped message from me about our second quarter results and our new strategy concerning Enron Broadband Services.  As you listen, I hope you find the information valuable and this new way of communicating easy and timely.  I plan to do this regularly, so watch your e-mail for future messages.  Thanks for listening and have a great day.

As part of our continuing communication we would like to inform you that a memorial scholarship fund has been established in memory of Chad Garren, who died during Tropical Storm Allison Friday night. "The Chad Garren Memorial Scholarship Fund" will benefit a student at Weatherford High School, Weatherford, Texas attending Texas A & M University. Chad was a Global Technology intern, working in ETS.  If you are interested in contributing to this fund, please send your donations to Community Relations EB1635a. Checks can be made payable to "The Chad Garren Memorial Scholarship Fund".  All donations will be matched by Enron, and it is not necessary to fill out a matching gift form.

Funeral services for Chad have been set for 10:00 am on Wednesday June 13 at the First United Methodist Church (301 South Main St.) in Weatherford, Texas.

On Saturday, June 9, Tropical Storm Allison left Houston in chaos dumping more than 20 inches of rain and flooding the city in a matter of hours. As of Sunday night, 17 people had died in the storm and many others are still missing. One of those who perished in the fatal flood was one of our employees, a summer intern in ETS and student at Texas A & M University, Chad Garren. Our condolences go out to his family and co-workers. At this time, Enron Community Relations and Aggies@Enron <mailto:Aggies@Enron> are planning to establish a scholarship fund in his memory.  More information on the fund will be forthcoming.

Enron has made a corporate contribution of $500,000 to the American Red Cross to aid in the victim relief effort. Enron employees are encouraged to donate to relief efforts and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.   Enron will match your contribution dollar for dollar and your donation will not be counted against your $15,000 annual limit.

Although Enron is supporting the American Red Cross, please feel free to make your donation to the non-profit organization of your choice that is offering aid to flood victims (they must provide proof of their 501c 3 status). Please send your check to EB1635a before Friday, June 15, and we will send it, along with a matching check to the appropriate agency.  On the memo line of your check, please make sure to write "Houston Flood Relief."  

We know that many Enron employees have been severely impacted by this devastating flood. Enron cares about you and your family and would like to make sure that your immediate needs are being met. If you have been displaced because of the flood, please contact the Community Relations hotline at ext. 37181 for assistance. Also, if you would like to help your co-workers who have been displaced, an account has been set up at the Enron Federal Credit Union to accept donations. Please bring/send your contribution to the Enron Federal Credit Union and make your checks out to Employee Flood Relief .

There are many agencies in Houston in need of volunteer assistance. If you would like to volunteer, please e-mail your name and extension to communityrelations@enron.com <mailto:communityrelations@enron.com>. Please note if you are willing to lead a project.

Again, our hearts go out to Chad's family and to all of you who have been impacted by this tragedy. Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

Hello all!

First, thank you for your generosity this holiday season, especially during this difficult time. Your gifts and donations will help bring holiday cheer into the lives of our three adopted families.

If you have chosen a gift tag from the tree: 
Please make sure your gift is clearly labeled with the recipient's name and a description of the gift. (We want to insure that all of the children have received gifts.) 
We ask that all gifts be wrapped and under the tree by Tuesday, December 18th. 
Also, if you have not already dropped the half of the gift tag into the red/gold box by the tree, please do so. This will not only allow us to keep track of who is purchasing what and for whom, but it will also enter your name into the drawing for Blazer tickets.

Once again, we appreciate your participation in our Enron Elves Event. If you have any questions or suggestions about ways we can help make our adopted families' holiday even more jolly, please let us know.

Happy Holidays!


----The Enron Elves Team----

Doesn't look like too much change - but this weather pattern is so conducive to precipitation in and West of the Cascades in the Northwest and British Columbia that I needed to up precipitation amounts there. Calfiornia should remain mostly dry and and most of the time mild to warm. Overall no split flow regime seen on the models through 15 days which will benefit western Canada and the northern 2/3 of the watershed areas for a little while until things change again.

Mark,
If you where to look at it from an Palo index basis, how would this look?  I think he wants to float with an index price but wants some feel for what type of basis to Palo we would use.   Its not really a firm bid since he is not really going to transact, so its really an indication of the market.  Kind of odd, but the better we make our price relative to Palo, the more likely we can get the business.  We should show him a strong bid subject to credit etc.   When the time comes to actually lock it in,  and most likely he will not since the units have no historical performance,  who knows what the market price  will be.

Mike

Subject:	We have length at Colstrip all hours on Monday, June 4

We are 7 MW long all hours at Montana System,  which is our buy from MPC, deal number 615780.1

The upstream is PSEI-DUKE-WWP-MPCO.

We put in a false schedule to Smurfit to get flat preschedule, and that tag is 23795.

When we get close to HE 0100 on Monday, that Tag needs to go away, and the energy needs to be sold.

Please don't say it was a false preschedule, just say that it was 'unexpectedly ramped down' or something.

Enpower accurately reflects the length at Montana System

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets
EGM's global crude and products group closed its largest trades to date wit=
h EOTT Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: EOT) on June 29,2001.  Enron Gas Liquid=
s, Inc. ("EGLI") is the counterparty to a 10-year toll conversion agreement=
 and a 10-year storage capacity agreement that also provides transportation=
.  The toll conversion agreement calls for EGLI to deliver a combination of=
 feedstocks (methanol, natural gas, and normal butane) to be converted into=
 various offtake products, primarily MTBE.=20

As a part of the 10-year conversion agreement, EGLI has the option to conve=
rt the facility into an Iso Octane plant.  The option to convert is EGLI's =
sole and exclusive right.  In addition, the call helps to mitigate the regu=
latory risk associated with the MTBE market.

Prior to the close of the 10-year conversion and storage capacity agreement=
s, Enron's corporate development group organized the sale of the hydrocarbo=
n-processing complex in Morgan's Point, Texas, and a liquids pipeline grid =
system to EOTT for approximately $120 million.  The asset sale was predicat=
ed on the agreements to be entered into between EGLI and EOTT. =20

These combined agreements represent EGM's largest transaction to date.

EGM Fundamentals
EGM Fundamentals welcomes Andrew Hill to the Houston office for a six-month=
 assignment from London.  Andrew joined EGM in March as a Senior Specialist=
 and has been instrumental in developing the growing range of EGM Fundament=
als publications such as Critical Mass and The Week Ahead.  In Houston, And=
rew will be working with Richard Lassander to manage analysis of the crude =
and products markets.  Prior to joining EGM, Andrew worked as a management =
consultant specializing in Latin America with Wood McKenzie.

EGM Fundamentals has begun analysis of domestic freight markets.  This new =
effort, managed by Jeff Andrews, is being coordinated with Matt Arnold's fo=
rward trading group in Enron Freight Markets (EFM).  Current analysis is fo=
cused on over-the-road trucking, following the initial commercial focus of =
EFM, and the development of diesel hedging strategies.  Related projects in=
clude modeling the seasonality of trucking demand and diesel fuel consumpti=
on and forecasting on-road diesel prices.  Within the next three to four we=
eks, analysis will begin of the intermodal freight network.  Interested par=
ties should watch the EGM Fundamentals intranet site (<http://egmfundy.corp=
.enron.com>) for updates.

East Power Origination
The Sand Hill Energy Center in Austin was dedicated on Wednesday, July 11th=
 at 10:00 am.  The $93.7 million project is the first peaking facility of i=
ts kind in Texas to be constructed with selective catalytic reduction pollu=
tion control equipment that reduces the nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission rate =
by 80 percent.  NOx emissions from the units are 5 parts per million (ppm),=
 which is considerably less than the amounts allowed by state and federal r=
egulations.  Congratulations to the development team!

IN THE NEWS

"For California to continue this bogus claim of $8.9 billion, I think just =
shows that they are not interested in any kind of a settlement," Enron spok=

is take responsibility for the problem they created."  Houston Chronicle, J=

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron Secures First Industrial Customer Gas Supply Deal In Germany=20
Congratulations to the German Gas Origination team for closing its first ph=
ysical supply contract with an industrial customer.  The customer, based in=
 Stendal, Germany, operates steam boilers for a milk factory and will be ta=
king gas from Enron for a contract of 9.3 MW of interruptible one-year base=
 load.

In connection with this supply contract the Continental Gas Trading team co=
mpleted a gas supply transaction, the first inside Germany by a non-incumbe=
nt player, with EnBW at Steinitz, to overcome capacity constraints expected=
 in Q3 this year.  Due to the fragmented gas industry in Germany, Enron had=
 to secure transport with no less than four network operators inside German=
y in order to close the gas supply deal.  "Although we are happy that we ha=
ve successfully secured all necessary transportation to fulfill our contrac=
tual obligations, it was quite a challenge to reach agreement with four net=
work operators -- while this was a transaction only within Germany, the neg=
otiation with the network operators was as complex as securing gas transpor=
t from Ireland through the UK and Belgium into France," commented Carsten H=
aack, who closed this deal together with Helge-Juergen Beil, Ulrich Finke a=
nd Gordon Smith from the German Gas Origination team.  Another important el=
ement of the deal is that the team succeeded in establishing the first tran=
sportation contract for VNG, Germany's largest German import company after =
Ruhrgas. "This contract will serve as a useful basis for future gas deals, =
especially in East Germany, " said Haack. "But more importantly, this deal =
will send a message to the market that once again Enron has proven to custo=
mers it can deliver on its promises and, of equal importance, that network =
operators had better take our transportation requests seriously!" he added.

ETOL Celebrates New Deals With Du Pont
Congratulations to Enron Teesside Operations Ltd (ETOL) for signing a serie=
s of deals with chemical giant Du Pont for supplies to its facilities at Wi=
lton International.

A new arrangement between the two parties means Enron will supply two milli=
on tonnes of steam and 30 MW of electricity a year to Du Pont's nylon plant=
s. New agreements have also been reached for gas supplies, and for the prov=
ision of a number of key site services including pipeline maintenance, secu=
rity and emergency response.

Paul Gavens, CEO of ETOL, said: "Securing an exclusive long-term supply agr=
eement of this nature with one of our largest customers is a fantastic achi=
evement for ETOL. The new arrangements extend the terms of our current cont=
ract for steam and power to 2010, restructure the pricing arrangements and =
offer the opportunity for adding value to both companies by optimizing the =
operation of their respective assets."


Enron's Northernmost Partner!
Enron Nordic Energy has entered into a partnership agreement with Varanger =
Kraft AS.  Under the terms of the deal, Enron Nordic Energy will assist Var=
anger in hedging its power sales, power prices and area prices.  The partne=
rship will also involve the development of a risk strategy for Varanger and=
 the provision of weather risk products relating to water flow and temperat=
ure risk.  In addition, the agreement will open opportunities for Enron to =
develop contacts with Varanger Kraft's Russian partners and the Russian mar=
ket generally.  Following a deal with Luster Energiverk, this is the second=
 such agreement closed by Enron Nordic Energy in recent weeks.

This is our first partner in the Nordic region with established relationshi=
ps in Russia, through its ownership of a grid connected to Russia.  Varange=
r has hydro power plants on the Passvik river near the Russian border.  As =
the Passvik river flows on both sides of the border, Varanger works in coop=
eration with Russian partners to manage the water storage.=20

FERC has set a meeting for Monday18 June 10 am PDT wherein it has noticed its California and WSCC-wide dockets.  The meeting has been timed in advance of congressional hearings (by Senator Joseph Lieberman) that were set for later in the week.

Expect FERC to respond to intense political pressure to expand its current price mitigation measures, possibly to a WSCC-wide scope or to all hours, or both.

As far as I know Hebert is still President of the FERC, which would speak to less intervention rather than more.

We will forward information as we learn it.

US FERC To Meet June 18 On Western US Electricity Prices
  
06/11/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 


WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has scheduled a special meeting June 18 to address pending matters involving electricity markets in California and neighboring Western states. 


The commission's meeting notice provides no details, except to list for discussion four cases involving price mitigation in, and the structure of, volatile power markets in California and 10 other Western states.


The meeting comes as members of Congress are placing enormous political pressure on the commission to take more drastic action to contain runaway electricity prices in the region. 


Last week, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., joined 21 Western-state congressional lawmakers to request an opportunity to appear before the commission to argue their case for cost-based price controls in the region's electricity markets. 


"At least twice, FERC has determined that the Western electricity market is 'dysfunctional' and that prices are 'unjust and unreasonable' under the Federal Power Act. Despite these findings, and contrary to the law, the commission has failed to bring these rates to just and reasonable levels," the lawmakers said in a letter to FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.

Hi Heather.

I am in SF today but will be back in the Portland office tomorrow (Thursday) morning. I do have two bikes that I can make available. One is a road bike and one is a mountain bike. Both are in good order.

The question will be how to get them to the Portland office from my house in Hillsboro. I'm sure we can work that out Thursday.

Jeff

The EnPower database will be down from 4 PM Friday afternoon (6 PM Houston) to 4 PM Saturday afternoon (6PM Houston).  The reason for this is the NETCO/Estate database and hardware split that is occuring this weekend.  

You must re-boot your machines following this shut down to access any EnPower applications.

Guys,

  I called PNM again today to inquire about the losses that are based on 3% of the market price that is determined by PNM's marketers.  Currently, they were priced at $100 market price times 3%, or $3 per MWh.

  Don at PNM transmission did not respond to me by yesterday as I had requested, and of course when I called him today, he is out until Monday.  So I talked to a Mark who could not give me much of an update.  

  The last time I talked to PNM, Don was going to take my request to have July's Market price that PNM was using for losses moved down to below the cap of $91.87.

  As of today, they have changed only August's transmission loss factor to the current cap price of $91.87 and posted this on their website as of this week.  

 I also asked why they let their marketers decide on a market price for losses when marketers are not supposed to be involved in transmission or transmission pricing.  Mark's response was that Losses are not ancillary and therefore, the marketers are allowed to suply information.  I will check into this.

I have left a message for Don to call me on Monday, as I would like to discuss the following items:
1. why they are unwilling to adjust the "market price" down for loss charges for July 2001 
2. how their marketers 'decide' on what market price they will use, ie- is there a formula?
3. Why they are using the cap price for August when prices are well below the cap

Please let me know if you have any more questions you would like me to pose to them when I speak with Don on Monday.


To view the changes to their website, go to :

http://www.swoasis.com/OASIS/PNM/data/listofproviders?PROV=PNM

>From the website: 
"Notice: The Loss Pricing for the month of August has changed from $100 to $91.87, which equates the change from $3.00/MWH to $2.7561/MWH. This is based on the FERC-Migated price outside of California."

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

=20

=20

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=

Arun in IT confirmed that the prior day curves are showing up correctly in the database, though they are showing up incorrectly on the front end curve manager.  He said it will take some time to fix the front end problems, and he expects the fix to be done by Monday.  He said since prior day prices are correct in the database, it should not mess up our calcs.  So as long as our traders make sure current day's prices are posted as they wanted, we will be fine.

Somehow today in the curve manager, prior day's prices column is not showing the prices as of yesterday, but showing prices based on today's price changes by the trader.  Driscoll first found out about it, and Arun is working on fixing the prior price now.  I'll let you know when he confirmed the problem is fixed.

An excerpt:
Operators at a San Bernardino County power plant owned by Reliant Energy Inc. say a complex plan to manipulate the California energy market began early last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the company's headquarters in Houston. 
According to the accounts of three plant operators, Reliant's operations schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease, then increase output at the 1,046-megawatt Etiwanda plant. This happened as many as four or five times an hour. Each time the units were ramped down and electricity production fell, plant employees watched on a control room computer screen as spot market energy prices rose. Then came the phone call to ramp the units back up. 
"They would tell us what to do, and we would do it," said one of the men, who only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear being fired. "Afterward, we would just sit there and watch the market change." 

Power juggling ramped up price 
Insiders say manipulation also strained equipment 
Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur, Chronicle Staff Writers <mailto:cberthelsen@sfchronicle.com>
Sunday, May 20, 2001 
?2001 San Francisco Chronicle </chronicle/info/copyright> 
URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/05/20/MN121438.DTL>
Large power companies have driven up electricity prices in California by throttling their generators up and down to create artificial shortages, according to dozens of interviews with regulators, lawyers and energy industry workers. 
Those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns that are depriving the state of much-needed electricity. The accounts are supported by an independent review of shutdown data by The Chronicle. 
The California Energy Commission calculates that an average of 14,990 megawatts of generating capacity, nearly a third of the state's total, was unavailable each day in April because of plant shutdowns, more than four times as much as a year ago. 
Such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as California enters another period of high demand, the warm spring and summer months of May to September, when electricity usage normally grows by a third. 
Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant shutdowns. And the California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid, says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of constricting supply. 
But an extensive investigation by The Chronicle has found that not only were generators shut down to boost prices but these "gaming" tactics contributed to the plants' deteriorating condition. 
"We suspected it," said Jim MacIntosh, the manager of grid operations for the ISO. "It was a sure factor in driving up prices." Such swings in unit output, he said, "would only make sense in a scenario when they're trying to game something. Otherwise, why would they do that? They're tearing their units up." 
Unusual phone calls 
Operators at a San Bernardino County power plant owned by Reliant Energy Inc. say a complex plan to manipulate the California energy market began early last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the company's headquarters in Houston. 
According to the accounts of three plant operators, Reliant's operations schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease, then increase output at the 1,046-megawatt Etiwanda plant. This happened as many as four or five times an hour. Each time the units were ramped down and electricity production fell, plant employees watched on a control room computer screen as spot market energy prices rose. Then came the phone call to ramp the units back up. 
"They would tell us what to do, and we would do it," said one of the men, who only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear being fired. "Afterward, we would just sit there and watch the market change." 
The workers said frequent and large swings in electricity output began at a number of California power plants just as the state's power crisis began in earnest. The workers and state power authorities assert the swings were one of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market. 
"It appears the control rooms are responsive to direction from the trading floors in Houston, rather than the reliability needs of the ISO," said Carl Wood, a commissioner with the utilities commission who is overseeing that agency's investigation into plant outages. "Instead of being responsive to demands for reliability, they're responsive to demands for profitability." 
Corporate denial 
Reliant officials adamantly deny using this tactic or any other mechanism to game the California energy market. They and other power companies, including AES Corp. and a partnership between NRG Energy Inc. and Dynegy Inc., have asserted that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging, decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet California's needs. 
While acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as frequently as every 10 minutes, company officials said it was done at the instructions of the ISO to maintain supply-demand balance. 
"As a part of routinely doing business within California and the California market design, we are required to do that," said Kevin Frankeny, an operations official with Reliant. "When the ISO (issues dispatch orders), they dispatch on a 10-minute basis. It can go up and down many times within an hour." 
Frankeny said he was not aware of any instances in which Reliant schedulers in Houston ordered dispatch changes without the ISO directing them to do it first. 
The ISO refused to comment on operations at any specific facility, but Stephanie McCorkle, an ISO spokeswoman, said the ramping tactics were used beyond dispatch instructions during periods of tight supply. And one of the plant operators said the orders to vary output came independently of the grid managers. "ISO was not calling Reliant every 10 minutes for that," said one of the operators. "Not for an individual unit." 
Officials with the California attorney general's office declined to comment on the legality of the ramping practice, citing a continuing investigation into whether wholesale energy prices are being manipulated. One source familiar with the state of various inquiries said the ramping, if proved to have been done to drive up prices, could violate the state's unfair business practices laws. 
Invisible practice 
How could companies such as Reliant tinker with output and not get caught? 
One of the plant workers said the practice was designed to be virtually invisible to regulators and grid operators. 
When power companies bid on hourly contracts, they agree to produce a certain amount of electricity over the given hour. Generators are paid based on an average of the spot market prices for that hour. By driving up the spot price, they can increase their hourly profits and still produce the total amount of energy required. 
The plant worker said the units would be ramped down immediately after their output measurement, which was performed at the top of each hour by the ISO. Then, he said, it was brought back up as the spot market price of electricity rose in response to the reduced output. By the time the ISO measured again, the output was back at the expected level. 
Another operator said the units were not always ramped up and down - that if the price reached a satisfactory level, generators would raise output and remain at that level as long as the price was right. Other times, if the price was low, output was brought down and kept down. 
The same operator said the amount of ramping appeared to be a matter of individual will of the company schedulers in Houston, with some being more aggressive than others. 
"What they would do, especially late at night, is if the price tanked, they would undergenerate," an operator said. "Then, mysteriously, the price would go up. 
"Then, if the schedule was at 70 (required megawatt hours of output), they'd say, 'Go up to 90.' That would cause the price to tank. And they'd say, 'Bring it down again.' " 
Rapid changes 
These fluctuations occurred within time spans of as little as 10 to 15 minutes, the operators said. But acceptable rates for bringing a unit from minimum to maximum levels when the plant was owned by Southern California Edison were more like 80 minutes, to avoid stressing the machinery, one of the workers said. Moreover, they were typically run at constant levels, which also reduced wear and tear. 
"They were basically ramping up as fast as they can, and then slamming the brakes on," said one of the operators. "They were increasing the fatigue on the units." 
ISO officials say they changed market operations last fall to crack down on gaming tactics, including instituting a so-called 10-minute market, rather than the hourly market, so that it could be more easily detected when companies were withholding power. 
But the ISO says generator outages have now become the primary tactic in driving up energy prices. 
A computer analysis by The Chronicle of shutdown data over a recent 39-day period shows Reliant and three other generating companies topped the list of plant shutdowns. Reliant also represented the largest amount of wattage lost among those companies. 
Plants owned by Reliant, AES, Mirant Corp. and Duke Energy Inc. accounted for more than half of the state's unplanned shutdowns, even though their generating capacity was no more than 25 percent of the state's total capacity from all sources. 
Reliant, one of California's largest and most profitable out-of-state generators, reported 319 shutdowns during the period in March and April. It was followed by Mirant Corp. of Atlanta (310), AES Corp. of Arlington, Va. (278) and Duke Energy North America of Charlotte, N.C. (261). 
Reliant's unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than 53,000 megawatts over the 40-day period, an average of 1,368 per day - enough power for 1.4 million homes for one hour. 
Its Ormond Beach plant in Oxnard, with one generating unit down for 26 days, 
accounted for more than 30,000 of those missed megawatts. However, an operator who worked in that plant said the outages there appeared to be the result of legitimate equipment failures. 
Reliant says there are valid reasons for its plants now to be in need of repair. They are old: At 48, Etiwanda is the oldest of Reliant's five California plants. And the company says routine maintenance was deferred so the plants could remain in service during times of high summer demand. 
But the operators said the issue is not so clear-cut. One problem at Etiwanda, a tube leak, had been present for about a month and was previously reported to management, they said, but it had not deteriorated much, it was operating at full capacity and there was no immediate need to take the unit offline because of the problem. 
Moreover, at the time of the shutdown, the ISO had expressly asked Reliant to keep the unit online, the operators said. Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant, denied that any Reliant unit was taken offline for unnecessary maintenance. 
Ramping may be rampant 
Sources say Reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice. A source familiar with the state utilities commission investigation said output logs obtained from AES' Alamitos plant also reflected production fluctuations. And an operator who has worked at the El Segundo plant co-owned by NRG and Dynegy said the practice was used there, although less frequently. The scheduling calls came from Dynegy's trading floor in Houston, rather than NRG in Minneapolis, he said. 
Steve Stengel, a spokesman for Dynegy, said changes in output at El Segundo were a normal function of changing demand levels throughout the day, and denied the company was engaged in gaming the California market. 
In a May 2000 report, the California Energy Commission cited Reliant's Etiwanda plant, as well as the Alamitos and El Segundo plants, as some of the "major beneficiaries of high real-time prices" that spring. 
One way to obtain those high prices, the plant workers said, was the simple method of demanding a sky-high price and refusing to deliver power if that price was not met. 
On one occasion, one operator said, Reliant ordered a unit at Etiwanda to be shut off because the ISO would not meet the price of $1,000 per megawatt hour, even though the legal price cap at the time was $750. 
"The operator said, 'It's our unit, shut it off,' " the source said.

Holden,

  Annuity # 685968.1 has been entered for $2250.00.  (LT SW books since that was the deal that was cut # 627566.1)
 I got the calculation as follows:

  Revenue lost in sale to WAPA Desert:  	          	-  $ 4,650.00
  Revenue gained from cut purchase from Mirant:  + $ 2,400.00
  Net 						+ $ 2,250.00   

  Please pass along this information to whomever needs it.

  Thanks,

  Virginia

LD Mirant for the loss of revenue due to cutting the schedule.  As long as we are kept whole financially then there should not be an issue.  Please let me know if you need any more info.  I assume that you will do the annuity but let me know if you want me to.

Subject:	WAPA cut on 6-2-01

Dear ST_SW Traders,

FYI - 
There was a cut on deal # 622350.1 on June 2, 2001 for HE 11.  It was a real time cut that reduced the schedule from 40 MW to 25 MW.  Mirant is at fault for the cut. (our up-stream is PAC).  
We originally thought that this got booked out between Mirant and WAPA, but when I spoke with Kathy yesterday, she informed me that there was no bookout and that they want to cut the schedule.  (the people involved during the cut were Geir at EPMI, Bob at PAC, Emily at Mirant, and Jackie for WAPA (Jackie is a control area dispatcher, so she cannot do bookouts for WAPA, hence there was no bookout)).  

We have agreed that to cut the schedule will be the best for now.  They do not plan on charging us LD's (she's checking with her boss to make sure.)  We will just reduce the schedules to 25 for HE 11.

It is up to you if you want to charge LD's to Mirant for the spread.

Just wanted to let you know and get your input.

Virginia

We regret to announce that Amy Fitzpatrick will be leaving Enron's Portland office in September.  Amy's husband, Simon, has accepted a job in New Jersey, and it didn't make sense for them to "commute" coast to coast.  Amy will continue to work here for the next month or two to hire her replacement and to make sure that her responsibilities have been completely handed over.  We really appreciate having such long lead time to effectuate this transition.

Amy has made tremendous contributions to our office over the last 14 months.  We really appreciate her efforts.  We realize that Amy has become integral to the efficient operation of the Portland office and want to make her transition as smooth as possible.  If you have any concerns or wish to get any issues on to the "transition list" please let your manager and/or Amy know.

To All Employees:

This morning Enron took a series of actions designed to stabilize our situation and preserve the value in our businesses:

-- We filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Contrary to popular belief, this does not mean we are out of business. What it does mean is that we have entered into a court-supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses, reorganize our finances, and explore various strategic, operational and financial alternatives, including the sale of non-core assets, in an orderly manner.


-- In connection with our filing for Chapter 11 reorganization, Enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly. Upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements, the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement Enron's existing capital and help the Company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business, including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today's filing.

-- We filed a lawsuit against Dynegy, alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for Dynegy's wrongful termination of our proposed merger. We are asking the court for damages of not less than $10 billion.

-- We also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company's wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure. As contemplated, this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from Enron's current wholesale energy trading team, and will conduct counterparty transactions through EnronOnline.

These are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow Enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business. From an operational standpoint, our energy businesses - including our pipelines, utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world, and will continue to do so.

As you know, the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost-savings program. This will entail a significant reduction in our work force. This is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day Tuesday, though in some cases notification will take longer.

For our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process, you will remain on the company payroll for now. In addition, we will submit a severance pay plan to the Bankruptcy Court for approval. This approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits. We will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the Court has made its determination.

I know these actions raise new questions about our company's future and what this means for each of us. Your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on Monday to discuss these events with you. In addition, you can access a copy of the press release on  <http://home.enron.com/>. We will also have a Q&A and other materials for you on Monday. While there is a great deal we simply don't know yet, we hope these materials will help answer at least some of your questions.

When decisions are made affecting our company, people, and operations, we will let you know as quickly as possible. There is still considerable value and opportunity in our business. The strategic restructuring process that we are beginning will allow us to preserve that value and those opportunities.

On behalf of the Board and entire management team, we greatly appreciate your patience, your professionalism and whatever support you can offer each other as we navigate through these tough times to a better future.

Ken

I wanted to commend the real time group for their efforts.  For the past 6 month, I've noticed a dramatic difference in the accuracy of deal entry in Enpower.  Accordingly, by the end of the day when I have to route, it has made my job that much easier.  In the past it would take hours to figure out what deals were entered incorrectly.  Now it is very rare that our position manager is off and this makes everyone's lives better!

Keep up the great work guys!!!!

Lisa

Chris and I would like to take this opportunity to update everyone on what =
has been happening on the floor(s) during the last couple of weeks and what=
 is likely to transpire in the weeks to come.  I'd like to begin by apologi=
zing for the lack of broad e-mail communications or floor meetings over the=
 last couple of weeks.  These have been very hard times and I know that peo=
ple have wanted information.  It has taken us nearly a week to sort through=
 who will be part of the UBS Warburg team and who continue with Enron. =20

In this e-mail I will explain: (1) who will be going to UBS Warburg, (2) wh=
o do the people working for Enron work for and what are they expected to do=
, (3) how will the physical separation between Enron and UBS Warburg happen=
, and (4) when will the sale of Netco to UBS Warburg be completed.  In addi=
tion to Chris Calger and me, the following Portland-based employees have ac=
cepted positions with UBS Warburg:

Last Name=09First Name=09Last Name=09First Name=09
Amador=09Susan=09Oh=09John=09
Anderson=09John=09Platter=09M=09

Mier=09Michael=09Yoder=09Christian=09
Nelson=09Kourtney=09=09=09

While there are a few people who are still making up their minds, the rest =
of the people in our office will be working for the Enron estate.  It is no=
t entirely clear to me right now what the management team for west power lo=
oks like for the Enron estate now.  As I understand it, there are two prima=
ry initiatives on the estate side that people in Portland may be a part of.=
  The first is the disposition of our development projects that are already=
 well under way.  Dave Parquet in San Francisco has been leading this effor=
t together with the Portland asset development team.  This effort has been =
ongoing since December.  The second is the disposition of our west power co=
mmodity positions.  Jim Fallon is in charge of this for the entire company.=
  People working on this for Jim include Don Miller, Paul Racicot, Brad Ric=
hter, Ed Baughman among others.  I have placed a call to Jim and to Paul to=
 get advice on how people in Portland should proceed.  I would recommend ta=
lking to Ed, Brad, Paul, or Don to get direction.  I have placed a call to =
several of these people to get direction and am waiting for a response.  I =
am hopeful that they will designate a lead person in Portland to coordinate=
 the power procurement and delivery efforts.

As most of you know, the physical separation between UBS Warburg and Enron =
has already begun.  People who will continue to work for Enron will be loca=
ted on the 4th Floor, while UBS Warburg will occoupy the 3rd Floor.  We hop=
e to make the moves to the 4th Floor by the end of this week.  Moves within=
 the 3rd Floor will take place the following week.

The UBS Warburg transaction is subject to one last pro forma regulatory hur=
dle.  While I don't have an exact date, I am told that it will likely be on=
 or about February 6th.

Finally, I want to once again thank everyone for their help and cooperation=
 over the last few weeks.  These have been really horrible times as the Enr=
on story continues to unfold in the news at the same time that people are f=
inding out about their future with Enron and UBS.  I know that this hasn't =
been easy for anyone.  I am deeply saddened overseeing the breakup of the a=
wesome team that we have put together.  Whether you are going to UBS, remai=
ning with Enron, or leaving the company, I wish everyone who worked on this=
 team the best in their future endeavors.  It has been a distinct honor to =
work with each and every one of you.

Regards,
Tim

In light of the tragic events that occurred on September 11, 2001, our concern is to support our employees through this difficult time.  We would like to take this opportunity to remind you of a resource available to you, Enron's Employee Assistance Program.  This service is available to you or any member of your immediate family to provide counseling services.

Please also be aware of any colleagues who may require assistance during this time and may not be able to seek help for themselves.

Holden-

  Do you reserve daily, weekly, or hourly transmission?  It looks like they are putting on charges for hourly ancillary and I don't think that these are hourly reservations.

Let me know ASAP.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

East Power Origination
On Friday, June 15, the Development Review Committee for Deerfield Beach, Florida, unanimously approved the 510 megawatt peaking power plant proposed for their city.  This approval followed on the heels of approval of the Developer's Agreement by the Deerfield Beach City Commission on Thursday, June 14.

Enron Industrial Markets
On Friday, June 8 Enron Industrial Markets closed transactions with Huntco Inc. under which EIM will provide inventory management services and will eventually provide more than 600,000 tons per year of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel products to Huntco Steel. The EIM project team developed a creative, 15-year structure that enhances Huntco's liquidity, reduces working capital requirements, and hedges their inventory position against directional price risk.  

In addition, EIM structured the acquisition of Huntco's cold mill and certain coil pickling operations.  A special purpose vehicle funded by third party equity now owns the assets, which continue to be operated by Huntco under an O&M agreement.  As part of the transaction, EIM purchased a 20-year call option on capacity at the cold mill located in Blytheville, Arkansas.  

These transactions with Huntco signal a fundamental change in the way steel is bought and sold in the United States.  They give Enron immediate access to physical steel and position Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways. Consummation of the Huntco transactions would not have been possible without the contributions of multiple Enron groups who enhanced value to Enron while significantly mitigating risk.

Due to problems with a Mirant downstream, I had to change a couple of paths late Monday.  The new and improved paths are:

LADWP-CISO(T)LDWP/SYL GF-LDWP(T)SYL/MALIN #LDWP00000178F-LA(T)SYL/MALIN LDWPCA0024-LADWP-MORGAN-BPA(T)MALIN/JD #10031F-BPA(T)JD/PGE #10031NF-MORGAN-AEP-EPMI-CAES-PGE.  Deal numbers 630912 and 556517.

IPCO-IPCO(T)IPCO/LGBP #79606F-IPCO-EPMI-MIRANT-SNOH-BPA(T)LGBP/JD #96092NF-SNOH-MIRANT-BPA(T)JD/MALIN #371697F-CISO(T)MALIN/NP15-MIRANT.  Deal numbers 524174 and 626428.

Both for 25mw on Light-load for 06/05.  I have made a tag, #24026, for the LA to PGE path.  It was made as a preschedule tag, but due to the lateness of it, BPA may deny it just because they can.  If that happens, EPMI real-time will have to make a real-time tag.  You can use my tag as a template.  Late breaking news - my tag went undelivered due to communication failure at PGE, so I faxed the tag to all the counterparties.  Mirant has made tag #5673 for the IPCO to NP15 path.  

All counterparties have been called as of 15:30 and are aware that these schedules are going real-time - that is, their real time groups will call the schedules in to BPA.  EPMI real-time will have to make sure this gets done with a reminder phone call to our counterparties.

I have spoken with PGE/Donna, AEP/Peggy, Mirant/Emily, and IPCO/Perry.  CAES (Conagra) had already gone home for the day and has no real-time.

Any questions?  Please call.

Thanks, Donald Robinson.

Recently, I asked you to "Lay It On the Line" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

First, let's take a look at the survey results.

I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were:

1.	Stock price
2.	The PRC
3.	Employee/internal morale
4.	External reputation and image
5.	"Walking the talk" of integrity and respect
_________________________________________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A "meltdown" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

I have updated the deal numbers 727040 and 737214 to how I think it should be valued.  When it comes down to it the differential will probably not be that large.  Let me know what the difference is now.

Below confirms that the transmission deals in April did calculate the correct
Demand Charge even though it created 3 strips.

Subject:	RE: Transmission Demand Charge

Heather,

This particular Transmission deal is basically 1 strip of a 1 month long deal.
It has been broken into 3 strips because of the daylight savings in April.
The demand Charge Frequency is MW per Month -- That means that Demand Charge Price (1,330) will be applied only once for the entire time of flow (4/1 to 4/30)
The Demand Charge Volume is 50.

The Demand Charge Price (1,330) will be applied to the Demand Charge Volume (50).
So the final Demand Charge will be:
	1330 * 50 = 66,500

 

Thanks!

Will I don't know if you are the person to ask - but I thought I would start with you.
I have a Transmission deal 539126 which was entered w/ a Demand Charge.
Frequency: MW Month
Demand Charge: 1330

The deal was for April 1-30.
Since the Strip was for April under PPT Enpower created 3 strips 
1) 4/1/01 - 4/1/01 HE1-2  50mw  Demand Charge: 1330
2) 4/1/01 - 4/1/01 HE4-24  50mw  Demand Charge: 1330
3) 4/2/01 - 4/30/01 HE1-24  50mw  Demand Charge: 1330


Everyone was worried that this would take the 3 strips and calculate the demand charge for each strip.
It appears this did just calculate one strip: so 1330 * 50 = 66,500
It was assumed this deal was going to calculate (1330 * 50) * 3strips = 199,500


Will what are your thoughts on how the monthly demand charge would calculate.
Do you think it will just take the mw value of one of the strips and calculate the monthly demand charge?

Thanks for your help on this,
Heather

Earlier this evening, the police were able to confirm to Enron that all of our employees who tragically died or were injured as a result of yesterday's explosion have now been identified.  This means we are now in a position to give you some information about the members of staff:


Graeme White
Graeme, 37, is in a stable condition at Middlesbrough General Hospital.  He has worked as an Operator Technician at Teesside Power Station since October 1999.  Graeme lives in Billingham and is separated with two children.

Paul Surtees 
Paul was Engineering & Maintenance Manager at Teesside Power Station and first joined the company in 1992.   He was divorced with a young daughter and lived in Hawthorn, County Durham.  Paul died in Middlesbrough General Hospital earlier today.  He was 40.

Andrew Sherwood
Andrew was an Operator Technician at Teesside Power Station and first joined the company in March 1999.  He lived with his partner in Hartlepool.  Andrew died at the scene yesterday. He was 36.

Darren Higgins
Darren was also an Operator Technician at Teesside Power Station and first joined the company in October 1997.  He was unmarried and lived in Normanby near Middlesbrough.  Darren died at the scene yesterday.  He was 28 and leaves a young son living in Poland.


We are continuing to offer as much support as possible to the families of these employees, as well as their friends and colleagues at the plant and associated sites across Enron.

We understand that the last twenty-four hours have been extremely traumatic for everyone concerned. We appreciate there are many questions that remain unanswered, but for the moment our thoughts and prayers are with those we have lost and their families and friends.

We will communicate more information about the incident as it becomes available.

John Sherriff and Michael Brown

In an effort to better organize the activities and minimize the expenses related to the Chapter 11 filing, we have formed the Bankruptcy Management Committee.  There are many outside firms representing multiple parties that will be requesting, among other things, certain tasks to be performed, filings with the bankruptcy court, financial analysis and general business information.  To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process.  The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly.  If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated.  All outside firms will be requested to notify a member of the committee prior to contacting other Enron personnel or outside parties, including the court and Creditors' Committee.

	Firm						Relationship

	Bankruptcy court (i.e. motions, etc.)		
	Creditors' Committee
	U.S. Trustee
	Ernst & Young					Accountants for the Creditor's Committee
	Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin		Financial advisors for the Creditors' Committee
Blackstone					Financial advisors for Enron
Batchelder and Partners				Financial advisors for Enron
Weil, Gotshal and Manges			Bankruptcy attorneys for Enron
Milbank Tweed					Attorneys for the Creditors' Committee
Andrews and Kurth				Attorneys for Enron Corp



The following are the members of the Bankruptcy Management Committee:

Ray Bowen - Chairman
Bob Butts
Jim Fallon
Dave Glassford
Dave Gorte
Mark Muller
Julia Murray
Lou Stoler

Initially, this committee will meet on a daily basis to organize all the bankruptcy related activities as well as to prioritize requests going to the Creditors' Committee and the court.  It is extremely important that the company provides accurate and timely information to the court, the Creditors' Committee and their advisors.  Accordingly, we request the assistance of all employees and outside firms in coordinating the bankruptcy efforts with this newly formed committee.

Please read the following carefully and retain this information for use whenever you trade on Bloomberg:

	1. Bloomberg charges a $15 FLAT broker fee.
	2. This fee applies whether you are the aggressor or receiver of a trade.
	3. This fee applies each time you make a trade on Bloomberg
		i.e. $15 per hit or lift, regardless of volume
	4. When you extend a Bloomberg deal in Deal Entry, account for each separate trade accordingly 	by adding $15 to any existing broker fee.
  ******	5. Because this fee is FLAT, select the "FLAT" button to the right of the broker fee. *****
	6. And most importantly, make a note in the "BROKER" box that the broker is in fact Bloomberg.

I know that many of you were never notified of the Bloomberg fee structure, but going forward we should see every trade done on Bloomberg showing up in the system as having been done with Bloomberg. The Confirms group in Houston has compiled a weighty list of "missing" hourly trades since the advent of Real Time Bloomberg trading. I believe these are all in the system, but possibly short a broker name and fee. This, going forward, should no longer be a problem.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding Bloomberg trading and/or fees. 

Thanks,
Kate

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.

NUGGETS & NOTES

Congratulations to Ann and Rodney Malcolm, vice president in EIM.  They are the proud parents of an 8 lb. 4 oz. baby boy named Scott.  He was born on Saturday, August 11, 2001.

EIM Trivia
Enron Industrial Markets currently owns two paper mills - Garden State Paper in Garfield, NJ and Papiers Stadacona in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada.  The combined annual newsprint capacity is 620,000 tonnes, which roughly translates to 137 billion square feet.  If you assume that the average width of a newspaper page is 25 inches, then this translates into Enron producing enough newsprint in a year to get us to Jupiter and half-way back to Earth.  Papiers Stadacona also produces approximately 100,000 tonnes per year of directory paper.  This translates into roughly 50 million telephone and trade directory books.  That's a lot of phone numbers!

This is to inform you that on January 25, 2002 the Honorable Arthur Gonzalez, United States Bankruptcy Judge for the Southern District of New York, entered an order as follows:

It is hereby Ordered that until further Order of this Court, Enron Corp., its affiliated debtors-in-possession in these jointly administered chapter 11 proceedings (collectively "Enron"), and Enron's employees shall preserve, and refrain from destroying or disposing of, any of Enron's records, either in electronic or paper form.

Obviously, any violation of this order will carry serious consequences.  We know that we can depend on you to comply with it fully.

Thank you.

Before I leave today, I just wanted to say what a great experience it has been working in Portland over the last 15 months.  I have learned so much and am amazed at what a motivated and talented team we have.  I will miss all of the friendships I have made and wish everyone the best of luck and success. 

If you are ever in Houston, please give me a ring!

Take care -
Amy

In just a few days we have collected $400, that equals $1200 after the Enron match!  We will be accepting donations tomorrow at the picnic and again on Monday.

Please see me if you have any questions regarding the match or charities.

Thank you for your generosity.  

Mollie


In an effort to support our fellow citizens during this time of disaster we will be collecting donations for relief efforts in NY, DC and PA.
A designated collection box has been placed by the lobby area.  All donations will be double matched by Enron.

If we all donated what we have would spent on the complimentary lunch today or what we would spend on coffee tomorrow, matched double by Enron, it would really add up.  The money will be sent on Monday, September 24.

The funds will be donated to the following organizations, please pay by cash or check payable to an organization listed below or a relief organization of your choice.  We will take care of the appropriate matching donation forms.

United Way Sept 11th Fund, <http://september11fund.org/>
American Red Cross Disaster Relief, <http://www.redcross.org/>

The following deals were done on eol, the upper time zone says PPT, but in the strip it says PST. These have all been changed


568049.1
568051.1
568052.1
568053.1
568054.1
568055.1
568056.1
568057.1




Why do these deals show up as physical at all? They are cross-portfolio deals.

I know we have had problems with them before,but I do not understand how a trade within the company is showing physical.

Thank you to everyone who participated in the Portland employee volunteer interest survey - we appreciate your feedback.

While monetary and in-kind gifts are important, hands-on volunteers are the lifeblood of any community agency. At Enron, we recognize that we are all stakeholders when it comes to the success of our communities. Over the years, Enron employee volunteers have provided helping hands, intellectual capital and skilled labor to non-profit agencies. We hope that by identifying some volunteer opportunities that interest Portland employees we will not only have the experience of contributing to the Portland community, but also build stronger teams within our own organization. We also believe that everyone will have some fun!

For those who have not yet had time to answer the survey, we did extend the deadline for one more week. Please take a few minutes and let us know what you think about volunteer opportunities by clicking on the link below. If you have questions about the survey, please send an e-mail to community-relations@enron.com.

Thank you,

Chris Calger and Tim Belden

A Developmentor manager has an introductory VB class locally that he is trying to fill.  I took a COM+/2000 class from them in December, and they are first class.  How many of us would be interested (no commitment at this point)?
 
I believe this is Developmentor's 12/3 one-week course (see  <http://www.develop.com/dm/course.asp?id=10>)  It ordinarily goes for $1800 per person.
 
Mike N, can you give me some guidance regarding how much cost per person or how much cost total you would be prepared to pay.  Again, he is trying to fill up a class that is about to be cancelled, and I think he would be willing to negotiate.
 
Tim, would you or anyone on your floor have any interest in this?
 
Michael

Attached is a copy of a sample letter which we are sending to selected vendors of Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries as an additional step toward implementing our commitment to conduct our business affairs in accordance with the highest ethical standards.

We are sending you a copy of this letter so that you will be aware that your vendors will be receiving this letter and so that you will be reminded that Enron does enlist the cooperation of its vendors in adhering to its Business Ethics Policy.

We appreciate your efforts in contributing to an Enron work environment of which we can all be proud.

******************************************************************************************************************************

SAMPLE 
November ____, 2001
OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN
<<Headquarter_Name>>
<<Street>>
<<City>><<State>><<Zip>>
<<Country>>
Dear Sir or Madam :
	Enron Corp. ("Enron") believes in conducting its business affairs in accordance with the highest ethical standards. As outlined in Enron's Code of Ethics, employees of Enron and its subsidiaries are required to comply with Enron's Business Ethics Policy which requires an employee to conduct himself/herself in a manner which is not detrimental to the best interests of Enron and which does not bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct consequence of his/her employment with Enron. Further, Enron's Business Ethics Policy states that no lavish entertainment or gifts are to be given or received by Enron employees for special position, price, or privilege.
 	Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but your cooperation in respecting these standards is also critical. Enron expects each of its vendors and contractors to maintain adequate records that document its work relationship with Enron. Enron's auditing department will routinely conduct business ethics compliance audits of certain vendors and contractors with whom Enron does business. Your recognition of our ethical standards allows Enron employees to work with you via arm's length transactions and avoids potentially embarrassing and unethical situations. If you ever become aware of variances from our policy, please advise:

 
	Your business relationship is important to us, and we look forward to maintaining that relationship with you.
Very truly yours,

The copier Coconut Telegraph has been out of service this morning.  It should be back up and running momentarily, but all jobs sent to it have had to be deleted.  If you sent a print job to Coconut Telegraph today, please be advised that you will need to resend or send to Barometer Soup instead.  We apologize for the inconvenience.  Thanks for your patience while we get this straightened out.

Holden I just looked at the Position Report Monthly and could see Cal'03 broken out monthly.
Please run it again and let me know if you can to.

Thanks,

Payables

Effective today, the responsibility for Accounts Payables has been moved to Global Strategic Sourcing under the leadership of George Wasaff.  He, along with the Accounts Payable team, is pleased to announce a number of system enhancements based on your valuable feedback.

Delegation of Authority 
iPayit now enables you to identify a delegate to code, review, or approve invoices on your behalf.  The system provides you with the flexibility to:
*  Identify a delegate as a coder, approver, or reviewer
*  Define the length of time that you would like to delegate your authority
*  Select whether the delegate will assume your approval amount, maintain their own approval amount, or assume a specific approval amount

Incorrect Company Code
Incorrect company code?  No problem!  The invoice will no longer return to Accounts Payable for correction before you are able to code the invoice.  iPayit enables you to select the correct company code and continue coding.

Additional Enhancements
*  In addition to Quick Forward, you can now Quick Approve invoices
*  Invoice comments can now be easily viewed from your in-box

Introducing iPayit
With so many new systems, you told us that it was easy to confuse Payables with iBuyit eProcurement.  To help clear up that confusion, we are pleased to announce that this new and improved version has a new name:  iPayit.  
*  To access iPayit, visit the iBuyit Portal or http://iPayit.enron.com.
*  Look for e-mail notifications from <mailto:ipayit@enron.com>.  

Sneak Peak
For a preview of the enhancements and how to use them, click on the link below:
http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/ipayitsyspres.ppt

This is just the beginning!  We have created a committee that is dedicated to improving the Accounts Payable process.  We hope to engage you in this effort and plan to actively seek your involvement and input.  We look forward to working with and hearing from you about future enhancements that will enable iPayit to play a valuable role in your invoice payment activities.

For invoice payment status please call the AP Call Center at (713) 853-7127 or toll free  (866) AP ENRON, or send an e-mail to <mailto:ipayit@enron.com>.

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

Friends and Co-Workers:

You are hereby cordially invited to a pre-holiday office lunch this Thursday at approximately 11:30 a.m, courtesy of the Trading Attorneys.

LEGAL NOTICE:  Christian Yoder and Steve Hall (hereinafter "we" or "our" or "us" ) intend to pay for the food (which will probably, but not necessarily, be pizza and salad) with post-petition Chapter 11 salary dollars that have already cleared our respective individual bank accounts and, therefore, by joining us in the meal ("Lunch") you will not be exposed to any retroactive claw-back risk by way of the Cash Account Committee.  We are also investigating the possibility of providing a limited quantity of a certain kind of beverage ("Beer") under a provisional waiver of the defunct pre-petition Company's drinking policies, subject to approval by the Estate's Liquor Control Board which is being sought on an expedited basis.       

We feel like making this modest holiday gesture for several reasons: 

1.  It has been a pleasure working with you all during the past year.
2.  We are optimistic about this office's prospects in the upcoming year.
3.  American Express forgot to cancel our Corporate Cards.

We hope you will join us for a free lunch as we look forward to a prosperous New Year.

Christian and Steve

The funerals of Andy, Darren and Paul, who tragically lost their lives in last Wednesday's explosion at Teesside Power Station, will be held this week at the following times:

Andy Sherwood	2.00pm, Wednesday, August 15
St  James Church, Hartlepool

Darren Higgins	9.15 am, Thursday, August 16
St. Andrews Church, Teesville, Middlesbrough

Paul Surtees		1.30 pm, Thursday, August 16
Easington Church of the Ascension, Easington Colliery

We know that everyone at Enron will want to remember the colleagues we have lost at this difficult time, and our thoughts and prayers are with their families and friends.

We are considering how best to commemorate the lives of Andy, Darren and Paul, and will be discussing our ideas with their families, in due course.

Graeme White is recovering in Middlesbrough General Hospital where his condition remains stable and we are continuing to provide as much support as possible for Graeme and his family.

The plant remains off-line and Enron continues to co-operate fully with the Health & Safety Executive's investigation into the cause of the explosion.

John Sherriff and Michael Brown

On Saturday, June 9, Tropical Storm Allison left Houston in chaos dumping more than 20 inches of rain and flooding the city in a matter of hours. As of Sunday night, 17 people had died in the storm and many others are still missing. One of those who perished in the fatal flood was one of our employees, a summer intern in ETS and student at Texas A & M University, Chad Garren. Our condolences go out to his family and co-workers. At this time, Enron Community Relations and Aggies@Enron <mailto:Aggies@Enron> are planning to establish a scholarship fund in his memory.  More information on the fund will be forthcoming.

Enron has made a corporate contribution of $500,000 to the American Red Cross to aid in the victim relief effort. Enron employees are encouraged to donate to relief efforts and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.   Enron will match your contribution dollar for dollar and your donation will not be counted against your $15,000 annual limit.

Although Enron is supporting the American Red Cross, please feel free to make your donation to the non-profit organization of your choice that is offering aid to flood victims (they must provide proof of their 501c 3 status). Please send your check to EB1635a before Friday, June 15, and we will send it, along with a matching check to the appropriate agency.  On the memo line of your check, please make sure to write "Houston Flood Relief."  

We know that many Enron employees have been severely impacted by this devastating flood. Enron cares about you and your family and would like to make sure that your immediate needs are being met. If you have been displaced because of the flood, please contact the Community Relations hotline at ext. 37181 for assistance. Also, if you would like to help your co-workers who have been displaced, an account has been set up at the Enron Federal Credit Union to accept donations. Please bring/send your contribution to the Enron Federal Credit Union and make your checks out to Employee Flood Relief .

There are many agencies in Houston in need of volunteer assistance. If you would like to volunteer, please e-mail your name and extension to communityrelations@enron.com <mailto:communityrelations@enron.com>. Please note if you are willing to lead a project.

Again, our hearts go out to Chad's family and to all of you who have been impacted by this tragedy. Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

As the United States begins to recover from the tragic events of September 11, it is important that Enron and its employees also begin the task of returning to "business as usual."   As a company with a global presence, returning to normal business practices necessarily involves travel.  
 The FAA has already implemented strengthened security measures for U.S. airports and air carriers to ensure air transportation is safe, secure, and ready to meet the needs of the traveling public.  We encourage all employees to return to their regular travel schedules.
We have no reason to believe that international travel is inherently unsafe at this time, although we strongly recommend -- in conjunction with the U.S. Department of State -- that all travel to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.   
Employees planning international travel can find updated security information on their country of destination on http://home.enron.com under the "International Travel" section of the Corporate Security website.  
All U.S.-based employees should continue to make their travel arrangements through Travel Agency in the Park at (713) 650-8080 or (800) 962-0248. Other employees should contact their local travel agency for assistance.

Hood To Coast Relay 2002

Enron North America will be sponsoring a Hood to Coast Relay Team for next year's competition (Aug. 23 & 24, 2002). The event, starting at Timberline and ending in Seaside,  is a great challenge and a lot of fun.  The team will be composed of 12 Enron employees, so if you are interested in participating in North America's most popular relay, spending a day and a half with your fabulous unshowered co-workers, eating bagels and bananas, and running on little if any sleep, or have a simply brilliant idea for a team name, please reply no later that October 20th.  For more details on the event, visit www.hoodtocoast.com.  
Run On.................................. Serena Bishop

Everyone,

As we stated earlier, this particular virus that is on the internet is causing a lot of issues for Corporations.  As a result, the companies who write anti-virus software are continuously updating their software.  As of this morning, another update has been made available to us.  This update does a better job of protecting your PC than the update we received last night.

At this time, it is extremely important that you again go through one of the procedures listed below to get the latest update.  

1.  Logout of the network and log back in or

2.  Click on START>PROGRAMS>ACCESSORIES>Norton AntiVirus Corporate Edition and then click the Live Update button.  This will pop up a screen where you will have to click the "Next" button and then a "Finish" button.  - If you are an EES user, this option is not available to you.  Please use option 1.

The proper version of the update pattern you need is:   (9/18/2001, version 30918BL) - You may need to restart the Norton Anti-Virus client if you want to visually insure that you have the latest update.

If you have questions or concerns, please direct them to your Resolution Center.

Let's try something a little bit different regarding Real Time deal disputes....

When Virginia and Mike receive a dispute from Houston, they'll file the pertinent information in a drawer (marked DMS) to the right of my desk, in a folder with your name on it. Please consult this folder at the beginning of every shift to determine whether you have any trades to clear up and how many. Sometime over the course of your shift, take a minute to address the discrepancy, make strides to resolve it. If it happens to be more complicated than an "intra-shift fix," talk to me so we can determine what needs to be done to expediate its resolution (pull tapes, pull our hair out, etc.)

The most important step of this new procedure is post-op - TELL SOMEONE WHAT YOU'VE DONE. Sign the corresponding DMS sheet and write a legible explanation of measures taken on the back. Return it to Virginia, Mike, or me. Whatever you do, don't leave without a trace.

I'd like to know if this sounds like a feasible plan; so feedback is welcome. In the meantime, this procedure will be effective immediately. Some of you already have disputes in your files.....Enjoy.

Thanks,
Kate

Stacy,

I have a tag that I think you made under West Desk.  (# 28010) The tag is showing 800 mw's of NPC (t).  The system doesn't have this transmission in it.  I'm checking out with NPC and I need to get your  ok or Holden's to put it in Enpower.

It seems that PNM is charging an unreasonable amount for losses.  Is there any way we could address this.

Guys-

   FYI  --  Public Service Company of New Mexico charges ancillary as follows:

  Schedule 1    Scheduling, System Control, and Dispatch Services -  $0.047 per MWh
  Schedule 2    Reactive Supply and Voltage Control - $0.066 per MWh
  Schedule 9    Loss Compensation Service - $3.00 per MWh.  This $3 is based on a $100 market price x 3%.  I have disputed this charge, arguing that the market (and as you mentioned the Cap) is well below $100.00.  I should be hearing from them soon and I will let you know when I do.  That could bring down  your total ancillary cost from July 2001 going forward.
  New Mexico Gross Receipts Tax - 5.75% of gross charges for the month.  This taxes applied to all schedules that remain within New Mexico. )For   example from Four Corners to San Juan).


Attached is a spreadsheet outlining this month's charges as of today (not accounting for any changes that may come in response to my dispute).

Let me know if you have any questions.

Virginia

As the southwest heats up, or the ISO goes into stages of emergency, or path 15 is congested north to south we will want to get power from the northwest utilities down to APS and so on in the southwest.  We can do this many ways but one that I have discovered that may have much capacity is as follows.

1.  NW Utility to PAC on BPA(T)
2.  PACW to IPC(T)@Enterprise(ENPR) on PAC(T)
3.  IPC@ENPR to PAC(T)@Borah Brady(BOBR) on IPC(T)
4.  IPC@BOBR to Four Corners(FC3) on PAC(T)
5.  Sink with anyone at four corners or buy tranny over to palo or mead.

I'm not sure how long there is going to be room but for monday there is 400mw of room on this path.


Enjoy,

Slinger

As we return to our regular business activities following last week's tragic events, we wanted to disseminate as widely as possible the following information on security and travel.  Updates will be posted as necessary under "bulletins" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com.

We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Enron's employees or facilities.  As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities.  We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804. 

All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings.

	We realize that, as Enron conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable.   Enron employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.   

	U.S. military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Pakistan, as well as in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Tajikistan.  Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against U.S. government or commercial facilities.  All travel to or through these countries should be canceled.

Most of the U.S.' busiest airports have implemented the FAA's stepped-up security measures and are open and operating, with the exception of Washington Reagan National Airport.  If you are traveling by air, allow plenty of time to check in under these new security procedures.  Contact your carrier directly to find out about flight schedules and specific boarding requirements.  You can find more information on the new security standards as well as a list of airports that have certified they can meet the new security standards on the FAA's website at http://www.faa.gov.

Dear Enron Employees:

I am saddened to inform you that there was an explosion and fire at our Teesside power facility in England at approximately 2:40 p.m. local time.  At this point, we know that two employees have died, and at least two others have been seriously injured. The area has been evacuated and the power station is currently off-line.  The cause of the incident is not yet known.  

Our hearts and deepest sympathies go out to the families of those affected by this terrible incident.  

Jeff Skilling

Can't make the live event?  No worries.  Go to eSpeak (http://ethink.enron.com/eSpeak/exec/default.asp) now and submit your question.  Calvin will try to answer it during his event and you can read the transcript later.


How do you feel about Enron's cost savings initiatives? Have you thought of some innovative ways to save money?  Talk amongst yourselves in eMeet  http://nahou-lnapp01.corp.enron.com/eThink/eMeet.nsf .



This week's ideas deposited into the Idea Vault include such interesting concepts as California time-of-day remote metering via broadband and prepaid gas cards.  Go to the Thinkbank (http://nahou-lnapp01.corp.enron.com/eThink/Thinkbank.nsf/HomePage?OpenPage) for all the details.

At Enron, we're good at a lot of things:  making markets, commoditizing products, managing risk, offering innovative energy solutions to customers - the list goes on and on.  However, one of the things we could do a lot better is watching our expenses.  We're all shareholders in this company, and we need to spend our company's dollars as wisely as we spend our own.

There are some simple, yet significant measures each of us can take to make sure we're careful with Enron's money.  The Policy Committee has approved and recommended the following:

?	Professional Services - This is our largest area of discretionary spending, at more than $600 million last year. "Professional Services" includes our contracts with outside law and accounting firms, contractors and other consulting groups.  To make sure that we are negotiating the best rates and terms of service for the company across business units, we are requiring all future professional service contracts and those up for renewal to be negotiated through or in consultation with Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS), effective July 1.  In addition, contracts for more than $5,000 must be pre-approved by the business unit senior executive or their designee and GSS.  For more information, see http://ibuyit.enron.com.

?	On-line expense reporting tool XMS - XMS, our online expense reporting tool, enables us to expedite, monitor and report expenses.  Effective July 1, all employees on domestic U.S. payroll will be required to use XMS for reimbursement of business-related expenses. To access XMS, go to http://xms.enron.com/.  

?	Enterprise wide portal - We currently have 122 internal web sites across the company.  The amount of technology work, marketing collateral, and other related costs required to develop and support so many portals is sizeable.  It makes sense to have one Enron portal so you can efficiently access content and services through a single, personalized channel that will make it easier for you to find information and perform basic tasks online.  This new company-wide portal, under the leadership of Tony Mends, will be launched in several phases beginning this fall.  

Another significant area where we can be more diligent in our spending is travel and entertainment.  Enron has long had travel policies in place.  As we have grown, we have not done as well as we should have in communicating those policies to new employees and reminding all employees to take advantage of the discounts we have negotiated.  The availability of discounts and booking services online should make it easy to save money for the company without sacrificing the comfort of employees who travel.  The following are common sense recommendations that we should all adhere to when traveling for business.  Any regular deviations from these travel policy recommendations will be reviewed by each business unit leader.

?	Air travel - Employees are requested to use either Travel Agency in the Park (TAP) or the GSS-approved preferred travel agency for your location - all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by GSS - or http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron, the new online travel booking service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same negotiated discounts.  Employees who fly in the United States should book non-refundable coach tickets, which are typically 65 percent less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a $100 fee.  For this reason, we strongly encourage all employees to purchase non-refundable domestic coach tickets when possible.

?	Lodging - GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate each business unit's individual hotel policy.  We recommend that you use Enron's list of preferred hotels to select accommodations that are in line with your business unit's policies.  You can view the list at http://travel.enron.com.

?	Car rental services - When renting a car for business travel, employees should use our preferred car rental agencies - National (U.S. and Canada) and Alamo (U.S.)- since the agreements we have negotiated are intended to protect you and Enron through the insurance coverage in our contract.  Visit http://travel.enron.com for details and updates to services available outside the U.S.

?	Off-site meetings - All domestic-U.S. off-site meetings and events with more than 10 people should be coordinated through GSS, which will negotiate preferred rates for Enron.  They can be reached at (713) 646-8311.

Because there are differences between business units and offices, each business unit leader will follow up this memo with a communication further elaborating on these policies as they apply to their business unit.

Each of us has a responsibility to make sure we do our part to ensure Enron retains its competitive edge.  These recommendations are some basic, sensible actions we can take company-wide, but it is up to every employee to look for cost saving measures and do what makes sense in your daily activities.  If you have an idea or a suggestion you would like to share with us, please e-mail us at recommendationsforcostsavings@enron.com.   A list of questions and answers about these policies is posted on http://ibuyit.enron.com/gss/ibuyit/csfaq.doc.  If you have additional questions, Policy Committee member Kevin Hannon will host an eSpeak on Tuesday, June 19 at 10 a.m. Houston time to discuss these cost saving recommendations.

If you are interested in borrowing a video tape of the PBS Frontline broadcast titled, "Blackout," please see me.  This video features interviews with Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling and other energy industry executives.

Best regards,
Anna

"California's power disaster has made 'energy' a front-burner issue for everyone. Through interviews with state and federal officials, power company executives, and average citizens, the documentary examines whether power companies and energy trading giants have capitalized on deregulation to make tremendous profits even as users suffer power shortages."

Dear Colleague,

This note is to inform you that, effective January 3, 2002, PIRA Energy

We hope not only that you have found value and use from our comprehensive

appreciated our close working relationship with Enron and we regret the
disruption. We certainly hope that we can restart a relationship with many
of you who will remain with Enron or move on elsewhere. Should it be the

TO:  All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan


Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.  

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. 

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the "Personal Data" option off the main log-in screen.  

If you have further questions, please contact a representative at the Benefits Service Center at 800-332-7979, option 3.

There is a 25 mw heavy load schedule that BPA is generating (contract# 23928) and SPP sinks at Humbolt.   The schedule is going real-time because SPP reported the transmission incorrectly to AVA transmission group.  We bought from BPA Deal # 486140.1 and sold to SPP Deal # 610573.1.  Please refer to SPP tag number #2848.  Be sure to call everyone in the path to check out.  

Thanks,

The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on "Disaster Relief"  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of "National Prayer and Remembrance," and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> 
o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/>
o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 


?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

Chip,

I have a new critical vendor with a prepetition invoice.  Arizona Public Service provides us critical transmission between the major trading points in the Southwest.  We owe them $43,708.60 for November transmission charges.  They will cut us if we do not pay.  I have explained that this payment needs to go through the creditor's cash approval process.

They can cut us starting tomorrow, but have agreed to a stay if we pay our December invoice of $8,071.20.  I will be faxing this invoice for immediate payment.

Steve

All, 

This weekend Houston experienced a flood that significantly impacted the IT environment, several Enron Information Technology systems experienced outages.  At this time all critical systems have been restored and should be operational.  

The Portland offices lost their connection to Houston for several hours (as did other Houston based companies due to power failures and Telco carrier failures). The following functionality was lost or severely impacted:

?	Email
?	Internet (CAISO access)
?	Houston file access
?	Houston based market data feeds
?	Tie lines and ring downs to Houston (Complete phone service has not been restored  in Houston and the circuits are very busy.)
?	Terminal Server Clusters, General and Trading. (CAPS, EnPower)

The above services have been restored.

While Houston was in the process of restoring service, several user and common data directories for Houston users and Houston based applications had to be restored from the backup tapes from Thursday evening.  Therefore, some of you may be missing data files on your M or O drives that you created or modified on Friday.  

Please contact me if you encounter any issues or have any questions.

Regards,

	David Steiner

Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses.

This reorganization will allow EGS to focus our resources on opportunities that present the highest value to Enron.  It will also accomplish the following:  1) enhanced synergies among our assets and personnel, 2) more effective prioritization of business opportunities, and 3) better management of Enron's asset-based businesses throughout the world.

Enron Global Services' energy asset portfolio includes the North American pipeline businesses of Enron Transportation Services (ETS), including Northern Border; the international pipeline, power and distribution operations of Enron Global Assets & Services (EGAS); Portland General Electric; EOTT Energy Corp; Enron Wind; Azurix and Wessex Water.  

Reporting to me as the heads of their respective business units are:
?	Jim Hughes, President & COO - EGS/International
?	Danny McCarty, Managing Director & CCO - ETS
?	Bill Cordes, President - Northern Border Partners
?	Peggy Fowler, President & CEO - Portland General Electric
?	John Garrison, President & CEO - Azurix
?	Dana Gibbs, President & COO - EOTT Energy Corp
?	Colin Skellett, CEO - Wessex Water
?	Adam Umanoff, President & CEO - Enron Wind

With the creation of EGS, we hope to enhance the efficient utilization of our commercial support services.  To accomplish this, EGS' staff and operational functions will be headed by:
?	Rod Hayslett, Managing Director & CFO 
?	Rob Walls, Managing Director & General Counsel 
?	Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Pipeline Operations and Engineering & Construction
?	Brian Stanley, President & CEO - EEOS
?	Steve Hotte, Vice President & CIO
?	John Ambler, Vice President, Communications & PR	
?	Gary Smith, Vice President, Human Resources

In addition, Rob Walls will continue to perform his role as Deputy General Counsel for Enron reporting to Jim Derrick.

Phil Lowry will be responsible for domestic pipeline operations, technical services and engineering & construction, as well as, international pipeline technical services and engineering & construction.  Brian Stanley will be responsible for technical services and engineering & construction for international power and distribution facilities.  

Below is an organization chart for Enron Global Services, which displays the changes described here.  We are confident this new organization will focus our talent and capital appropriately.  Please join me in supporting this management team as it strives to maximize Enron's return on its assets.

Cara.

I'm going home for the weekend and I thought I would let you know the
procedure to follow to get your schedules at MEAD scheduled real time.

These are the schedules that are in as a preschedule:
	TAG   0025726
	TAG   0025777
	MSCGO1 TAG MSCI113

The left over mw's, after these tags,  will all have to be submitted as a
realtime tag NO EARLIER THAN 4 HOURS BEFORE THE SCHEDULE RUNS.

You will have to call PSCO marketing realtime desk to tell them what you new
tags will be  303-308-6175.  They have a heads up from me as to what you
will call about.  If you do not call,  THEY WILL NOT PUT THE SCHEDULE IN, WE
WILL NOT GENERATE.

I understand EPMI's problem today.  I've been there when I worked for MIECO.
Our control area that we turn all our schedules into are kind of hard to
work with sometimes.  It is up to them weather or not a schedule gets put in
as a preschedule.  Before they go home every night, they must check out
preschedules with their adjacent control areas.  Since they work on an
hourly basis, and don't get bonuses,  they are not always willing to stick
around and wait on late tags.  Between 3:00pm and 4:00pm MDT, they take the
tags they have and start to check out with them.  Everything else must be
put in real time.  This sometimes makes our jobs harder but there is nothing
I can do about it.  I hope everything else goes well and these schedules get
put in.

Our Downstream is WWP deal # 339963.1

The path:

West Kootenai (G)-BCH(T)JUANITA/BCUS O#M335781A-WKPL-DYPMI-SNPD(T)BPA(T)BCUS/AVA O#96062 HNF-DYPMI-EPMI-WWP  

MONTH LONG TAG 26019

HE 0700-0800 we are warned by SNPD that the transmission MAY BE curtailed to Zero.

When I spoke with Susan at WWP she finds this very suspicious, as it was described to her as a "West of Hatwai" problem she is suspicious of this and is investigating.


Please get with DYPMI and get their re-supplied transmission before this schedule flows in the morning.

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Risk Markets (GRM) is pleased to announce the financial close of Project Ranch. This transaction involved an insurance wrap on a Volumetric Production Payment (VPP) consummated by Enron Capital Resources in February 2001. As part of this deal, Enron was able to successfully syndicate upstream reserve and operations risk to the insurance markets. The convergence of Insurance and Capital Markets is still a novel concept in the world of finance and Enron is proud to be one of the first companies to be involved in a transaction of this kind. Special mention should be made of the GRM deal team (Doug Jones, Rafi Khan, Tony Wolfe, Sebastien Saubier, Brian Cohen) and of the Global Finance team (Tim Proffitt, Nora Dobin, Chris Herron, Ying Liu) for their very hard work and dedication to the deal. 


Enron Engineering and Operational Services
Since May, EEOS has been providing operational support at the Cuiaba, Brazil facility, a 450 MW combined cycle plant.  Our team members have consisted of John Krupski and Yaser Tobeh from the Houston office, Don Schmidt from New Albany, Derrick Skerritt and Howard Peel from our Teeside operations in the UK.  

John, Yaser, Don, Derrick and Howard have been providing operational and maintenance support at the project, as well as providing mentor/coaching support for the staff. They have been instrumental in developing and implementing a team building approach at the facility and trying to instill a sense of ownership with the facility.  Additionally, they have been working closely with Simmens and our start-up team ensuring that the plant will be commissioned successfully on natural gas.  Gas commissioning started on August 5th, and to date we have had a successful run with one unit.  Thus the momentum has been building very quickly for the local staff to assume full operations sometime within the next 30 days.  EEOS will keep a small crew involved over the next six months, keeping a watchful eye on operations to make sure that things keep rolling along smoothly.

Enron Industrial Markets
The Forest Products Origination Group headed by Rob Saltiel develops transactions for forest products companies that can benefit from EIM's risk management and structured finance capabilities.  The goal is to advance Enron's desired physical and financial commodity positions in newsprint, pulp, recycled papers, linerboard and/or lumber while bringing commodity and capital benefits to customers.

Given the difficulties currently facing the industry, many companies are particularly interested in managing their earnings and balance sheets more tightly.  As a result, the originators are gaining access to industry CEOs and CFOs to develop their deal concepts.   Current deals under development include asset monetizations, supply/inventory outsourcing, pre-payments for physical supplies, and sculpted swaps.      


IN THE NEWS
HOUSTON (AP) - After a shakeup of its upper management ranks earlier this month, energy giant Enron Corp. solidified its leadership Tuesday by promoting two longtime executives. 
Greg Whalley was named president and chief operating officer while Mark Frevert was elevated to vice chairman. Both will join Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman of the board and chief executive, in the Office of the Chairman.
"Greg and Mark bring a wealth of talent and experience to the Office of the Chairman," Lay said. "In addition to having led Enron Wholesale Services, they have a collective 26 years of extensive experience across Enron's businesses and both played key roles in increasing our deliveries of energy and other commodities in North America and Europe."

Enron Wholesale Services Best Practice Tips
Skytel is Enron's Preferred Vendor for Paging Devices
Included in the Skytel agreement are numeric/alphanumeric pagers, advanced messaging service devices, and encrypted remote e-mail services via Blackberry? enabled devices.  Enron also receives special discount incentives through year-end 2001, such as 50% discount on Blackberry?-enabled hardware purchases and trade-in allowances on select Research in Motion (RIM) units.  Note:  Employees presently using both pagers and cell phones are encouraged to consolidate to one device by eliminating pagers and utilizing cell phones only.  Negotiations are currently underway to determine the preferred cell phone provider for Enron.

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

        I want to thank you for your cooperation in responding to my previous notice regarding the suspension of our document retention policy.

        Through the excellent work of our  IT group, we have now secured our electronic media as needed for litigation purposes.  Accordingly, except as noted below, we will now return to our normal electronic document retention policy.

        In order that we may capture all possible electronic information related to the litigation, please do the following:

        1.      If you have any voice mails that relate in any way to the LJM Deal or Chewco Investments L.P., including any accounting issues related to these transactions, please forward the voice mails to  x3-6800.

        2.      If you have any voice mails that relate in any way to Enron's public statements regarding EBS, Azurix, New Power Co., or any voice mail regarding financial transactions involving these matters, including accounting issues related to these matters, please forward the voice mails to  x3-6801.

        3.      If you have any e-mails that relate in any way to the LJM Deal or Chewco Investments L.P., including any accounting issues related to these transactions, please forward the e-mails to  LJM.Litigation@enron.com.

        4.      If you have any e-mails that relate in any way to Enron's public statements regarding EBS, Azurix, New Power Co., or any  e-mail regarding financial transactions involving these matters, including accounting issues related to these matters, please forward the e-mails to ClassAction.Litigation@enron.com.

Also, please forward all future e-mails and voice mails that relate to the above-referenced subjects to the appropriate e-mail address or voice mail box.  These procedures will ensure that our electronic documents and voice mails are properly preserved.

        Over the next month, our lawyers will be collecting our traditional files, i.e., written documents, for possible production in litigation.  In the meantime, please retain all of your hard-copy files that in any way relate to:

        1.      The LJM Deal 
        2.      Azurix 
        3.      New Power Co. 
        4.      EBS

        6.      Accounting for any Enron investments 
        7.      Any Enron public statement made to the investment public 
        8.      Any Enron public filing with the SEC or other regulatory bodies 

        Please err on the side of retention of documents.

Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

Hi everyone,

The Risk is in the process of adding the daily price for the front month into the existing price report. Besides the existing Region curves, we could also add several more frequently used Basis curves in this report if it's necessary. 

So we would like your input on what Basis curves you think would be helpful to be added to the new report. 

Thanks for your help and please let me know by the end of today.

Metropolitan Water District indicated to Holden this morning that they were unwilling to take delivery of January contracts due to the fact that the market price is below the contract price.

I show they are obligated to receive 50 MW LLH Mead 230 @ $24, and 50 MW LLH Mead 230 @ $22.5.

The manager there is John Lambec   213.217.7387

Can you advise us how to proceed, does this create a default situation?

To all who use Curve Manager,

	As you know, we have been experiencing technical difficulties with Curve Manager on Terminal Server. As of right now, please use Curve Manager locally. This application runs just as fast as on terminal server as it does locally. Also, it seems to be more stable running locally. However, if you DO experience difficulty running this application locally, please let me know ASAP.

thanks,

During the course of their investigation, Special Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be taking documents they believe may be important for their investigation from employees' offices.  The FBI has agreed to return copies of such documents. 

In addition, should you have an immediate need for a document requested by the FBI, please make a copy of the specific document and give the original to the FBI. Thank you for your cooperation.

For Short Term this is how the Sunday price works:

Sunday Peak price should be marked as is - we will value at whatever you mark for Peak.
6x8+24 price is not affected by the Peak price (only LT because it looks at what the Sunday price is marked @).

For Short Term - Portcalc (calculation system) will take your Sunday deal and value like a Peak day.
ie HE 1-24, portcalc will take your Sunday offpeak price for HE1-6,23-24 & your peak price for HE7-22.
So mark the price as you want it valued.

Portcalc uses 75% of peak for Long Term only.

They are looking into the Sunday scalars option..... I will keep you updated on that.

Arun could you help me decipher the proper way to mark Sunday.

I am working w/ the STSW desk on this.
Does Portcalc use 75% of what they mark for the Sunday (in the ON PEAK column)?
If so should Holden be marking that Sunday price a little higher if it will be valued at 75% of what he marks?
How is the Off-Peak (6x8+24 - since this is the short-term desk) price affected by how he marks Sunday Peak?

Thanks for your help,
Heather

With the departure of Greg Wolfe and Holli Krebs, it is necessary to reestablish responsibilities to assure our continued success.  To this end:

Chris Foster will assume responsibility for the Services Desk in addition to retaining overall responsibility for the Middle Market Coverage Group.  Although he will continue to provide leadership to John, Paul and Stewart in managing the Middle Market Coverage effort, Chris will focus his day-to-day efforts on our Services business.  

John Malowney, Paul Choi and Stewart Rosman will be taking a greater leadership role within the Coverage Group.  Within this coverage group, John Malowney will assume a leadership role for Industrials throughout the WSCC, Stewart Rosman will assume responsibility for public utilities, IOUs and public/federal utilities in the Northwest and Northern California and Paul Choi will cover these same sectors in the Southwest and Southern California.  Although each of these individuals will take the lead in assuring coverage for their market segment, it will be done on a collaborative basis to take advantage of individual relationships and talents and to make sure there is back-up if someone is out of the office.  Additional personnel will be hired in the Middle Market Coverage Group within the next month.  Job postings will be made shortly.

Bill Williams will continue to manage the Real Time Group and will now report to Tim Belden.

Lisa Gang will move into the Services Group to help manage our scheduling agreement with El Paso and provide support for other services arrangements.  This will be effective September 10.  Lisa Gang, Les Rawson, and Stan Cocke will report to Chris Foster and endeavor to expand our already successful Services business.
 
While we will miss Holli and Greg personally, I have complete confidence that the new energy and fresh ideas that their departure brings will assure our market leader position will not compromised.

Derivatives I - Applied Energy Derivatives
Presented by Paradigm Strategy Group

Date:  		Monday, June 4th and Tuesday, June 5th
Time:		8:00 am to 5:00 pm

This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today.  An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Participants attending this seminar will be able to:

Formulate customer hedge strategies based on a solid understanding of risk; its impact on capital structures and approaches to its mitigation.
Develop and interpret forward prices in the context of arbitration disciplines, as well as understand the divergences from these disciplines that are characteristic of energy prices.
Identify marketing opportunities through an understanding of both the forward curve and the distortions created by the physical system of production and transportation.
Assemble the pricing of a transaction from a benchmark price curve.
Devise cost-reducing deal structures for gas storage from an understanding of price curves and their components.
Exploit differences in locational pricing with insights into the relationship between basis and transportation/transmission.
Structure a natural gas and power swap to hedge a company's risk position, explaining its risks and benefits as a risk management tool.
Price a swap from the price curve and customize the structure to meet various customer needs including earnings, cash flow and embedded financing. 
Apply basis swaps to either mitigate locational risk or to achieve a more favorable risk/reward position by altering the index location.
Attain a fluency in language concepts and hedging application of options.
Package strips of options to create caps, floors and zero-premium collars.
Create structures that provide energy users with sub-index pricing using embedded options.

Friends and Co-Workers:

You are hereby cordially invited to a pre-holiday office lunch this Thursday at approximately 11:30 a.m, courtesy of the Trading Attorneys.

LEGAL NOTICE:  Christian Yoder and Steve Hall (hereinafter "we" or "our" or "us" ) intend to pay for the food (which will probably, but not necessarily, be pizza and salad) with post-petition Chapter 11 salary dollars that have already cleared our respective individual bank accounts and, therefore, by joining us in the meal ("Lunch") you will not be exposed to any retroactive claw-back risk by way of the Cash Account Committee.  We are also investigating the possibility of providing a limited quantity of a certain kind of beverage ("Beer") under a provisional waiver of the defunct pre-petition Company's drinking policies, subject to approval by the Estate's Liquor Control Board which is being sought on an expedited basis.       

We feel like making this modest holiday gesture for several reasons: 

1.  It has been a pleasure working with you all during the past year.
2.  We are optimistic about this office's prospects in the upcoming year.
3.  American Express forgot to cancel our Corporate Cards.

We hope you will join us for a free lunch as we look forward to a prosperous New Year.

Christian and Steve

Houston has requested we sit down with them on the phone and go over all the in-the-money contracts we have.  By their count we have about 50.  They want to account for each and understand why we may not be delivering on them.

Ed Baughman will be sending his master list in advance of a 11:30 call in Mt. Bachelor.  Please send at least one representative from each of the regional desks to discuss the list.

Thanks,

Steve

The FBI has uncorroborated evidence of possible terrorist attacks against the United States.  Reportedly, unspecified groups are targeting suspension bridges on the West Coast beginning Friday, Nov. 2 and continuing through Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2001.

No further information about this alleged attack is known at this time.  The FBI is attempting to verify the validity of this report.  In the meantime, California officials are increasing security at the state's suspension bridges, and the National Guard has been authorized to assign troops to protect the bridges.

We shared this information with our West Coast employees earlier in the day.  In the current circumstances, we are likely to see these bulletins fairly frequently.  We don't want to alarm you, but we do want to keep you informed, so we will continue to disseminate this information.

Guys-

   FYI  --  Public Service Company of New Mexico charges ancillary as follows:

  Schedule 1    Scheduling, System Control, and Dispatch Services -  $0.047 per MWh
  Schedule 2    Reactive Supply and Voltage Control - $0.066 per MWh
  Schedule 9    Loss Compensation Service - $3.00 per MWh.  This $3 is based on a $100 market price x 3%.  I have disputed this charge, arguing that the market (and as you mentioned the Cap) is well below $100.00.  I should be hearing from them soon and I will let you know when I do.  That could bring down  your total ancillary cost from July 2001 going forward.
  New Mexico Gross Receipts Tax - 5.75% of gross charges for the month.  This taxes applied to all schedules that remain within New Mexico. )For   example from Four Corners to San Juan).


Attached is a spreadsheet outlining this month's charges as of today (not accounting for any changes that may come in response to my dispute).

Let me know if you have any questions.

Virginia

Once again it is time to begin the nomination process for Enron's Chairman's Award.  

For those of you who are new to Enron, the Chairman's award is an employee-driven award designed to recognize Enron employees who make a difference in our organization by demonstrating our core values - Respect, Integrity, Communication, Excellence - in everything they do.  These individuals are the Everyday Heroes who make Enron a great place to work. They capture the spirit, the philosophy and the day-to-day business practices of our company in their work, their attitude and how they regard their colleagues.  

This award program will only be as successful as your participation in it.  All Enron employees can nominate fellow employees at any level - from the top down or the bottom up.  

Nomination forms will be available around the world.  Find the forms on your intranet site or at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  Direct any questions to mbx_chairmansaward@enron.com

The nomination process is simple.  Complete and submit the nomination form by Wednesday, October 10, 2001.  This year's Selection Committee will then review all nominations and present recommendations to the Office of the Chairman for final approval.

The Chairman's Award winner and finalists will be announced at the annual Enron Management Conference in San Antonio, Texas on November 16, 2001. 

I want to personally encourage each of you to think about your colleagues, their contributions to Enron and their adherence to our values.  If there is someone you know who is one of our many "everyday heroes" and you think they deserve to be recognized for their dedication and commitment to Enron's values, now is your turn to speak up?so please take the time to nominate someone you know for this very special award.

I look forward to learning more about our outstanding employees here at Enron and thank you for your participation.

This is the proposal of how we want to value the new UAMPS deal.
Just want to keep you in the loop.

Subject:	Index Option

Matt I need written confirmation regarding the analysis of the new Deal Type "Index Option" for IT to implement.

Index Option will be a physical option with a strike @ an Index.
For a BDay option expiry the analysis will work as follows:

The forward position will be valued taking the deal strip hours, these hours
will be valued against the scalars - the hours in the money compared
to the forward underlying price will be estimated as exercised. Only the hours
in the money will be evaluated.  For the day of exercise the hours evaluated will
be the hours exercised in scheduling. 

Buy Call: Estimated Exercised hour will have a price above the mid
Buy Put: Estimated Exercised hour will have a price below the mid

Daily the Option Exercise function in Enpower will create an Index Forward Leg
from the Index Option (expiry will be daily but the price will be hourly) @ a strike of the specified Index.

Liquidation:
Liquidation for the next day will be calculated using the actual exercised strip against the curve as the mid price.
The True-up will be index vs curve when the index is published.

We regret to announce that Rick Bergsieker has decided to leave Enron to pursue other interests.  Rick has led our commercial activities in the Middle East for the past several years.  Rick is a highly respected individual within the company as well as within the energy sector, and we will miss his contributions.

With Rick's departure, we are realigning the Global LNG group into the following four separate functional areas: Americas Origination, European and Pacific Origination, New Asset Implementation and Trading and Logistics.  These functional areas will report to Eric Gonzales who will be assuming lead responsibility for the Global LNG business unit.

Within the Americas Origination effort, Doug Arnell will take the group leadership for activities within the Atlantic Basin.  The priorities for Doug's group include the continued development of the Bahamas Terminal and the implementation of the Elba terminal agreement.  The current teams focused on the VLNG project and North American West Coast project are also part of the Americas effort and will continue reporting directly to Eric.

Clay Harris will expand his role to lead the European and Pacific Origination function from the London office.  Reporting to Clay will be the existing Pacific Origination team as well as the members of the London based LNG team.  

The New Asset Implementation group will be led by Greg Curran.  Greg's group will be focusing on the successful implementation of construction and initial operations of our LNG assets under development. 

The Trading and Logistics groups will continue reporting to Jonathan Whitehead. 

Please join us in wishing Rick well for the future, and congratulating Eric, Doug, Clay, and Greg on their new and expanded roles.

Mike McConnell & Jeff Shankman

Mark, Tom, and Holden,

In reference to the DPR impacts of $ 132,000 (WAPA) and $133,000 (SRP) that you were expecting, here is an explanation of why you will not be seeing that in your PMA's:

The 2 deals listed below were put in as a MW month, each with 3 strips in the deal separating out April 1, April 2, and the rest of the month.  The reason for the 3 strips was to catch the April 1 time change from PST to PDT.  

deal #  539126: 3 strips @ 2216 = 199,500 charge for the month in CARP (true value is - $66,500).
deal #  538832: 3 strips @ 2180 = 196,200 charge for the month in CARP (true value is - $65,400) .


Typically, I provide you with a report that tells you what $ amount to look for coming thru in your PMA's, according to the changes that I am making on the back end.  You then see the change in DPR come thru on a PMA report that Risk provides for you.  

When these deals hit Settlements, we recognized that the CARP was calculating both deals at 3 times their monthly value (and since we are purchasing, that is a negative three times against your books).  When the above + DPR impacts didn't come thru in your PMA's, we started looking at the deals to figure out why they didn't.


Here is a discription of the Risk - Settlements process:
Risk values a deal on the day of liquidation.  Any intra-month changes, even if they happen after the day of flow, get trued up by Risk and changed in the DPR.  Anything that gets changed after the end of the month, Settlements recognizes as a DPR variance and reports this to Risk and you see it affect your DPR as reported in the PMA report.

So the question was: When it came to recognizing a variance in Settlements, why weren't we seeing a + amount back to your books for 2 of the strips that I zero'd out? 

Houston Settlements looked into it and were seeing that these deals were originally valued at ($66,500) and ($65,400), even though CARP was showing that they were calculating at ($199,500) and ($196,200) ....

Heather Dunton and I did alot of searching for the answer and we found that:  When Risk flashed these deals in April, they flashed them according to a single MW month charge.  Regardless of how many strips there are, the deal is set up as a MW month and should, therefore, calculate as one single charge for the month. 

We found that CARP is reading these incorrectly and causing the confusion, (as I was seeing that the deals were calculating 3 times because that is how CARP and UNIFY were reading the deal). 

 The IT people in Houston are now working on fixing that glitch.

When it comes to DPR, your book originally recognized an impact of (66,500) and (65,400), which is correct.  Since your April DPR was correct, you will not see an adjustment in your PMA's.  

I recognize that this is not gratification for the + DPR impact that you were expecting and I apologize for the confusion and mis-information that I gave you in my report.  This has, however, helped us to hi-light a technical error that will save us alot of work in the future. 

Thanks for your patience while we figured this out.
Let me know if you have any questions.

 Thanks,

 Virginia

We're lending again.....

The STSW desk will be 20 mw short per the El Paso lending agreement, on peak @ 4C-345kv. The day-ahead sale price is $27.05. Please purchase to cover this position under the STWHOURLY desk and complete an inter-desk sale to STSW to tie out our positions. 

PLEASE NOTE: INTER-DESK SWAPS ARE NOT THE SAME AS ANNUITIES. YOU CANNOT NET THE DAY'S VOLUME AND SWAP OUT AT ONLY ONE HOUR. YOU MUST BUY AND SELL THE SAME AMOUNT EACH HOUR TO REMAIN AT ZERO EACH HOUR.

It's been awhile since we've done this, so here's a reminder of the procedure. Once you've purchased to cover this short in the real time market, you must sell back to El Paso @ $0 to keep our position net zero. Then reduce the day-ahead purchase price from El Paso (794022) to $2 to cover the lending service fee.

Please, please, please ask me if you have ANY questions about how to do this.

Here is the Q&A on the agreement and the press release.

 
Merger Q&A
Nov. 9, 2001 
THE DEAL
What are the deal terms?
The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange. 
The exchange ratio will be 0.2685. As an example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 269 shares of the combined company upon closing. 
Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares. 
ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock. ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately, and an additional $1 billion upon closing of the merger. 
Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock. 
Enron will have immediate access to the $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.
What approvals are required?
This merger will require SEC and FERC approvals, the approval of shareholders of both Enron and Dynegy, and expiration or termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period. In addition, various approvals are required due to the ownership of Enron's and Dynegy's wholly owned subsidiaries.
>From a business standpoint, are Enron and Dynegy now one company?
Not until closing, which may not occur for a number of months. Until that time we will continue to deal with one another on a commercial level as competitors, just as we have done in the past. In general, this means that we cannot share commercial information, coordinate commercial behavior, agree on prices, etc. We will act towards Dynegy the same way that we would act toward any other competitor.
When do you expect the deal to close?
The transaction is expected to close by the end of Q3 2002.
Why do you believe this is the best deal for shareholders?
The Board considered numerous options-stand-alone execution, private equity infusions, strategic partner infusion and a merger with a strategic partner. The Enron Board felt that the merger with Dynegy, coupled with the $1.5 billion equity investment, was the best opportunity for continued growth and shareholder value.
What is the ownership structure of the new company? 
On a converted basis, Enron shareholders will own approximately 36% of the new company, and Dynegy shareholders will own 64%. Post closing, the combined company is expected to have approximately 700 million shares outstanding.
What percentage of shareholder votes is required to approve the transaction? 
A majority of Enron shareholders must approve the transaction, and 2/3 of Dynegy shareholders must approve.
Has a new management team been identified?
Chuck Watson - Chairman and CEO
Steve Bergstrom - President and COO
Greg Whalley - Executive Vice President
Robert Doty - CFO
Watson, Bergstrom and Whalley will make up the combined company's Office of the Chairman.
Has Dynegy completed due diligence? Are they satisfied that the potential exposure is manageable?
Dynegy has completed significant due diligence and there is no due diligence out as such. Dynegy was fully aware of the matters reported recently with respect to certain financial statement restatements and related party transactions.
How will the Board seats be allocated?
When the merger is complete, the Board of Directors of the combined company will be comprised of no more than 15 members. Dynegy's designees will include three from ChevronTexaco. Enron will have the right to designate a minimum of three board members.
How will the merger impact customers?
We expect customers to benefit significantly from this combination. This combination provides a wider and more diverse platform to meet the energy needs of our customers with reliable delivery and predictable pricing. Customers will also benefit from broader supply-sources of the two companies.
Does this mean Northern Natural Gas is no longer a part of Enron?
No. Northern Natural Gas will remain an important member of the Enron family. If the merger is terminated Dynegy has a right to acquire Northern Natural Gas, subject to a repurchase right of Enron.
Is Dynegy buying Northern Natural Gas?
No, Dynegy is buying a $1.5 billion preferred stock interest in Northern Natural Gas and acquiring an option to acquire 100% of Northern Natural Gas in certain circumstances if the merger is terminated.
What percent of Northern Natural Gas will Dynegy own?
They will own preferred stock unless and until the merger is terminated and Dynegy exercises its right under certain circumstances to purchase 100% of Northern Natural Gas.
FINANCIAL ISSUES
Why is Enron merging at this price?
Enron's Board of Directors and management considered numerous options to best serve the interest of our shareholders, including: 
Stand-alone execution. 
Private equity infusion. 
Strategic partner infusion. 
A merger with a strategic partner.
The Board and management feel strongly that a merger with Dynegy, which included an immediate infusion of $1.5 billion in cash, offered the best opportunity for continued growth and enhanced shareholder value. 
Have you discussed the combination with the rating agencies?
Yes. The preliminary assessment by the rating agencies has been positive.
ENRON QUESTIONS
What are the immediate business benefits of the transaction?
This deal confirms the value of Enron's core business and strengthens the company's liquidity. This transaction enables the shareholders of both companies to participate in the upside of the combined enterprise.
What will happen to Enron Online?
It will continue as EnronOnline until the transaction closes.
How will you treat proprietary trading information prior to the deal close? What impact will this have on counterparty trading?
Until the deal closes they remain separate companies and will keep confidential trading information confidential.
What will happen to Enron's pending asset sales?
The asset sales we have previously announced are scheduled to move forward.
What happens to the SEC investigation?
As we have from the beginning, Enron will continue to fully cooperate with the SEC investigation.
What happens to the lines of credit Enron took out last week?
Enron drew down on $3 billion from existing credit lines and has obtained commitment letters on an additional $1 billion secured financing.
Will any Enron executives have a role in the combined company's senior management team?
Yes, Greg Whalley will serve as Executive Vice President and will join Dynegy's Office of the Chairman when the transaction closes.
What happens to Ken Lay?
Ken Lay will remain as Chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes. He will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.
Will Enron complete its new building?
Yes.
Is Enron's vision still to be the world's leading company?
Enron's vision will be revisited once the companies are merged.
Will this affect Enron's innovation?
A key strength of Enron and Dynegy has been their employees' innovation and we expect this to continue.
What will this do to our deregulation efforts?
Both Enron and Dynegy share the belief in open markets and competition. We believe our deregulation efforts will continue.
DYNEGY ISSUES
Dynegy profile:
Dynegy Inc. is a leading energy merchant and power generator in North America, the United Kingdom and Continental Europe. A Fortune 100 company, Dynegy in 2000 established its communications business, Dynegy Global Communications, which is engaged in providing network solutions and connectivity to wholesale customers worldwide..
What is ChevronTexaco's relationship to this deal?
ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock. ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion at the closing of the merger.
COMBINED
What will the new company's name be?
The combined company will retain Dynegy's name.
Who will be the CEO of the new company?
Chuck Watson, chairman and CEO of Dynegy Inc. will become the Chairman and CEO of the new entity.
Who will be president?
Steve Bergstrom, president and COO of Dynegy Inc. will become the President and COO of the new entity.
Will there be an integration team? Who will be on it?
The integration process will be focused on designing a strong and efficient organization. Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient transition. Details of the make-up of the team have not yet been determined.
Will the companies merge offices and where?
There are currently no plans to merge offices. Considering the size of a combined organization, however, office spaces will be evaluated at a later date.
COMMUNITY ISSUES
Will Enron Field be renamed?
The combined company will determine this.
Is Enron's contribution program continuing during this time?
The contributions program will still be a focus for Enron, but we have curtailed new giving for now.
What does this merger mean for Houston?
We believe that it is positive for Houston because two premier energy companies will join forces and remain in the city.
EMPLOYMENT ISSUES
Will Enron (or Dynegy) employees be laid off as a result of the merger?
The merger will be a long and complex process. Some elimination of positions is almost inevitable in this type of merger, and one of the key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure and resourcing of the merged company.
How many lay offs will there be?
Prior to the merger, we hope to address any need for employment reductions through attrition and reduced hirings. We cannot rule out involuntary separations, but we have not targeted a specific number at this time.
If I am laid off, either prior to the merger completion (or as a result of it), what will my severance package be? Will the severance plan change?
If an Enron employee is let go prior to the merger, and is eligible for benefits under the Enron Corp. Severance Plan, then the terms of that plan will govern. Post merger, employees will be eligible for benefits under whatever severance plan the merged company adopts. No changes to the severance plan have been made at this time.
What happens to our bonuses this year?
The 2001 bonus process will continue as usual and will be consistent with previous practice based on company and individual performance.
What will happen to my stock options?
Your vested unexercised and unvested options will be converted as follows:
The number of options will be converted on the same ratio as outstanding shares are converted. Your number of Enron options will be multiplied by 0.2685 to calculate the number of Dynegy options at close. At the closing of the merger, the strike price on your Enron options will be divided by the merger ratio 0.2685 to determine the strike price of the new Dynegy options.
Will there be salary adjustments as a result of the merger?
Both companies will continue our market-based approach to compensating employees. In addition, both companies have a strong pay for performance philosophy in regard to total cash compensation. Prior to the merger, there will be no changes in Enron's salary structure. Post merger, we will jointly determine our salary strategy and structure.
What will happen with benefits and retirement programs?
There are no anticipated changes to Enron benefit plans before the merger is completed. Upon completion of the merger we anticipate that there will likely be changes to ensure that one benefits strategy exists for the merged company.
Will the analyst and associate program at Enron continue?
As we bring both companies together, we will look into the possibility of combining both Dynegy's PACE program with Enron's Associate/Analyst program.
Where do I go if I have a question?
A detailed general Q & A on the merger is being prepared at present and will be posted on the Enron Update intranet page. Additionally, Enron and Dynegy HR teams are jointly preparing a detailed employee Q & A to address HR-related questions. This will be posted on the same website as the general Q & A. In the interim, if you have a specific question or concern you may email questions@enron.com. 
INTERNAL ISSUES
What will happen to non-Houston locations?
Decisions will be made about all locations in the coming weeks.
Will moves to the new building continue as planned?
Yes, at this time.
When will we begin seeing changes in our workplace?
Until the merger is completed it is unlikely you will see many changes in the workplace. As things change, we will share this information with you.
Will there be a year-end PRC?
We are still reviewing the year-end process.
Does Dynegy have a performance review process like Enron?
Dynegy has a similar performance review to Enron's.
Will there still be a Chairman's Award?
Yes.
Will any early retirement packages be offered?
There are no plans to offer such packages at this time.
Is there a hiring freeze? Will all open positions at Enron just remain open or be cancelled?
We are carefully evaluating every open position and only staffing those that are critical to the business.
INTERNAL - COMMUNITY RELATIONS
Will the VIP program continue?
We are currently evaluating this program.
Will the matching gifts program continue?
We are currently evaluating this program.
What happens to the Enron childcare center?
It will continue its current operations. We will re-evaluate operations after the merger.
What happens to ClickatHome?
We are currently evaluating this program.
If employees are laid off, will they be required to pay for their computers from the ClickatHome program?
Enron's current policy will remain in effect which states that individuals who leave as a consequence of involuntary termination are not required to pay back the cost of the computer, however, they are required to pay the taxes as stated on heir W2 form.
Will the Enron Body Shop remain open?
The Body Shop will remain open and continue with normal hours. Once the merger is nearing completion the program will be evaluated.
What does this mean for the United Way?
Both Enron and Dynegy are supporters of the United Way. The merged entity will also continue to support the UW. The company will match all employee contributions to the United Way as promised.

All

We had 2 service outages today, the External Internet and Email both became unavailable at about 11:00 am today, service was restored in after about 15-20 minutes.  The fact that both services went down at the same time is only coincidence.

Below are the basic causes for the outages:

The Internet outage was caused by an error in one of our Network Routers.  The device was rebooted and service was restored.

The Email outage was caused by a bug in Exchange that is remedied by rebooting the server.

Sorry for the inconvenience these outages may have caused.

We are pleased to announce the following organizational changes:

Enron Global Assets and Services

In order to increase senior management focus on our international businesse=
s, we are creating a new business unit, Enron Global Assets and Services (E=
GAS).  EGAS will be led by Kevin Hannon, Chief Executive Officer, and Jim H=
ughes, Chief Operating Officer.  Kevin will report to the Enron Corp. Offic=
e of the Chairman.  With the exception of the Wessex Water Company (which w=
ill remain in the Enron Transportation Services organization) and Enron Ind=
ia (discussed below), EGAS will include all of the assets and activities of=
 the former Enron Global Assets group and the Azurix organization.  EGAS wi=
ll include Enron's assets and merchant activities in South America.  In ord=
er to ensure continuity in the management of our South American merchant bu=
siness, John Lavorato will remain responsible for those merchant activities=
.  John will report to Kevin Hannon with respect to the South American merc=
hant business, and will continue to report to the Enron Wholesale Services =
Office of the Chairman for all other activities in his role as Chief Execut=
ive Officer of Enron Americas.

Enron India

Enron's significant interests in India are commanding increased attention f=
rom Enron's senior management.  We are pleased to announce that Rebecca McD=
onald will focus exclusively on Enron's business in India, as Chief Executi=
ve Officer of Enron India, reporting to the Enron Corp. Office of the Chair=
man.

Enron Broadband Services

With Kevin's departure from Enron Broadband Services (EBS), we are also mak=
ing a number of changes in the EBS organization.  Jim Fallon will now be Pr=
esident and Chief Operating Officer of EBS.  Paul Racicot, Marcello Romano =
and Fred Cohagan will maintain their EBS risk management activities within =
their respective regions.  Dave Cox will continue as Chief Commercial Offic=
er of EBS and will also join Ken Rice and Jim Fallon in the EBS Office of t=
he Chairman.  Finally, Rick Fehl will continue as Vice President of Network=
 Engineering and Chief Network Officer but will now report to the EBS Offic=
e of the Chairman.


Enron Principal Investments

In order to better develop and manage equity investment opportunities relat=
ed to Enron's core businesses, we are combining the existing investment gro=
ups in ENA, EBS, Enron Investment Partners and the Enron Special Asset Grou=
p into a single unit, Enron Principal Investments.  Enron Principal Investm=
ents will work with all Enron business units to identify, execute, and mana=
ge equity investments that leverage Enron's unique and proprietary knowledg=
e.  These investments may be in the form of venture capital, leveraged buy-=
outs, traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.  This new b=
usiness unit will be headed by Kevin Garland, Managing Director, and will r=
eport to an investment committee consisting of Dave Delainey, Ken Rice, and=
 Greg Whalley.=20

Enron Corporate Development

In order to improve coordination of Enron's corporate development activitie=
s, we are consolidating these activities under Andy Fastow, Executive Vice =
President and Chief Financial Officer.  Jeff Donahue, Managing Director of =
Corporate Development for EBS will now head Corporate Development across En=
ron.  Corporate Development leaders in the business units will have a dual =
reporting relationship to their business units and to Jeff.

One of Enron's most compelling challenges is the sale of certain assets or =
businesses that are no longer core operations.  Mark Metts, Executive Vice =
President of Enron Corp., will head up a new Special Projects group to spec=
ifically focus on the completion of some of these more challenging transact=
ions. =20

Please join us in congratulating all of these individuals on their new resp=
onsibilities.

Dear Enron Employees:

I'm sorry to report that a third Enron employee has died in the hospital as a result of injuries from yesterday's explosion and fire at Teesside Power Station.  To lose another employee is a devastating blow to all of us.  A fourth employee remains in the hospital and is in stable condition.  Please keep these employees and their families in your thoughts and prayers.  We will release their names as soon as all family members and relatives have been notified.

I'm in the U.K. now and will be visiting with the employees and families who've been affected by this tragic accident.  I will also visit the site and will meet with authorities in order to determine the cause of the explosion.  I will keep you posted on any new developments.

Dear Traders:

  Please be advised that the following worksheet is an estimated summary of transmission ancillary charges.  These charges are above and beyond the normal price for transmission and do not include transmission reservation charges in them.  To figure approximately how much each MW of transmission will cost when all charges have been applied, use the following worksheet, adding each of the 4 ancillary charges that apply to the transmission cost.

  For example:  

   I reserve 55 MW's of Sierra Pacific transmission.
 
  Scheduling Fees:   			(55 MW's x 0.1649) =   9.07
  Reactive Supply and Voltage fees: 	9.1692 x (0.45 x 55) x 0.0234 = 5.31
  Line Losses:				0.0234 x 55 MW's x (anticipate average energy cost so far this month; circa $45) = 57.92
				**Please note that if energy prices are higher, this line loss charge will be higher too;  ie - if prices are at $300, this charge will be 386.10**
 
   TOTAL ANCILLARY:			$ 72.30 for 55 MW's  = $ 1.315 per MW hour of transmission


   

Attached is the worksheet:

                             
Please ask me if you have any questions.


  Virginia

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

>From Kevin Hannon, Jim Hughes and John Lavorato

Our efforts to move our South American merchant business model to look like our North American and European models has been evolving quickly.  In the volatile Brazilian power market, Enron is poised to start-up the first merchant plant in the near future.  We are working on several structured transactions and are at the forefront in working with Brazilian regulators to create a viable deregulated power market.

To continue our positive momentum in South America, we have decided to change the leadership of the merchant business.  We have asked Orlando Gonzalez to become President and CEO.  In addition we have asked Brett Wiggs to join Orlando in the office of the chairman as Chief Commercial Officer.

Joe Kishkill has been involved in the South American business for many years and will be exploring other opportunities within Enron.  We would like to thank Joe for his contributions.  

Please join us in congratulating Orlando and Brett on their new duties.

Please refer to Enron Tag #23876.  The path is 

BHPLGS gen @ BHPLSYSTEM- BHPL (T) BHPL/STGL - BHPLGS - MEAN - LAPT(T)STEGW/DAVEJOHNSTON - MEAN - MIRANT- PPW(T)DAVEJOHNSTON/4C3- MIRANT- EPMI- APS(T)4C3/WW5 - EPMI- CRSPM1 - WALC(T)WW5/WW2- WALC(T)WW2/COOLADGE- CRSPM1 load @ COOLADGE.

We had problems getting the tag approved.  This is a good path and should flow.  Both the generating and load control areas have a copy of this tag and have agreed to implement this schedule real-time even if the tag is denied.  I spoke with Brandi at WACM (970) 461-7277 and Theresa at WALC (602) 352-2552.  

If there are any issues regarding how the load PSE should be represented on the tag, John Dake at WALC said the CRSPM1 was the appropriate PSE for these tags and there is no reason the schedule should be denied.   

You can reach me on my cell at 807-7861 if you have any additional questions.

Attached is a short memo and summary outlining changes to the Business School Loan Program for the Western Hemisphere. As many of you know, over the past couple of months we have taken a hard look at our approach to business school loans. The updated guidelines better serve Enron's business interests, eliminate credit exposure for the company, and potentially broaden the reach of the Loan Program. If you have any questions, please contact Ted Bland (x35275) who leads Career Development for the Program.

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Avista Corp. (AVA) has started the final, seven-day t=
est of its new 280-megawatt Rathdrum power plant unit 2 in Idaho, a source =
familiar with the plant's operation said Wednesday. The generator, which wa=
s generating near full capacity Thursday morning, will enter commercial ope=
rations if the final test is successful, the source said. The company would=
 only confirm that the unit is in tests and declined to estimate the start =
of commercial operations. The original schedule, set when construction bega=
n in March 1999, projected the plant would be on line in the fourth quarter=
 of this year. More recently, however, the company had pegged commercial op=
eration for August. A couple of previous attempts at the final, seven-day t=
est had to be abandoned. Avista spokeswoman Catherine Markson declined to s=
ay what problems had arisen. "It's just the normal start-up testing sort of=
 stuff. We're still way ahead of schedule, which is contracted with vendors=
 for Nov. 1," Markson said. -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4=

I invite you to provide feedback on the Analyst & Associate Program, using a very short, anonymous and confidential survey. In the very near future, you will receive an email from ramabile@execlead.com asking for feedback on your overall satisfaction with the Program, and your suggestion of one thing we should focus on for improvement. To insure confidentiality of your responses, Executive Leadership has been engaged to conduct and compile the results of the survey. 
The survey is designed to be completed in about two minutes, and your participation is important. We plan to do short surveys like this a couple of times each year, in addition to the all employee survey. As always, I invite each of you to contact me or anyone on my team if you'd like to discuss ideas or issues in person. 
Thank you in advance for your participation, 
Billy Lemmons

Dear Zhiyun and Norman:

Due to legal reasons we are in the process of changing deals with delivery point of WestWing to either WestWing 230KV or WestWing 500KV.  However, in PortCalc if the delivery point is changed to WestWing 230KV or WestWing 500KV the deals will be valued against WSCC-S curve, not WestWing curve.  Due to this we have observed unfavorable prior day and curve shift; this is not what our traders expected and wanted the deals to be valued.  An example is deal#802862.1 in which delivery point was changed from WestWing to WestWing 500KV on 10/5/01 and we suffered a $294K loss due to the deal change.  (post id 13377 on 10/5/01 vs. post id 13337 on 10/4/01)

We would like the deals to be still looking at WestWing curve when delivery points are WestWing 230KV or WestWing 500KV.  Please change the mapping of the valuation in PortCalc so the traders can get their deal change and "unreal" curve shift back.  

Please let me know your timeline on this and if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Fran

I regret to announce that Sean Crandall has tendered his resignation from Enron.  He has decided to return to his native land of Utah to join Duke Energy's trading team.  Sean made tremendous contributions to our trading floor during the past few years.  He will be sorely missed.  Please join me in wishing Sean the best in his future endeavors.

Subject:	Luscar/USW update

There have been few developments since the start of the strike so it has
been a while since the last update.  Below is the current status:

     The Alberta Labour Relations Board (ALRB) has determined that pickets
     on the plant gates as occurred during the first 3 days of the strike
     and disrupted TransAlta operations are not allowed.
     Luscar is fulfilling their responsibility to supply fuel to
     TransAlta's Sundance and Keephills plants through the implementation
     of their contingency plans.
     Inventories used to supply the units when mine operations are slowed
     remain at adequate levels.
     The most significant impact to date has been to coal blending
     operations.  Suboptimum blending results in derates.  Challenges in
     this area are expected to continue for the duration of the strike and
     likely several days thereafter.
     Risks to plant and mine operations from the strike exist.  Luscar and
     TransAlta have plans in place to address these risks but there are no
     guarantees that output will be maintained at current levels.  It is
     our objective to adapt operations to minimize the impact of these
     events which are outside of our control and to meet our PPA
     obligations as much of the time as possible.

We understand Luscar and the USW will be meeting later today.

Should the situation change as a result of the meeting or any other
consequential developments I will send another e-mail within a few hours,
including over the weekend.

Regards,
Jim

Enron Principal Investments (EPI), which was formed in the 2nd quarter, has completed its integration and the development of its new strategy.  This group will be responsible for identifying, closing, managing and exiting all non-E&P equity investments for Enron worldwide.  Kevin Garland will lead EPI, which includes Barbara Paige, Andrew Marsden, Kevin Kuykendall, Steven Sheldon, Michele Nezi Marvin and Mark Gandy.  Additionally, Dick Lydecker and the Special Asset Group will continue to report to Kevin.

EPI will pursue investments related to Enron's core businesses, where Enron has a unique insight into the market, company or technology.  Initially, this will be geographically focused in North America and Europe.  This group will rely heavily on the support and cooperation of the core business units to provide information and market insight.  

EPI may make investments in the form of venture capital, leverage buyouts, growth equity, or private equity in public companies.  The group will not make investments in seed stage companies, other funds, subsidiaries of larger corporations, or project equity.

Please join me in supporting the efforts of Enron Principal Investments.

Please stay tuned for more information!

If Delano is ramped down HE 7-10 and we buy to replace remember that we have to be below Delano's generation costs. We then split the upside with them. We might want to try to avoid HE 10 as it is a little risky. Keep it in mind

The outage will continue through the weekend for the 17.91 MW on the steam turbine.  I filed an outage report with the ISO for this period although the ISO has not returned it.

Group,

Per my earlier email, there has been one change.  Harbor's second unit (HRBGN_7_PL2X3), 17mw, will be down for maintenance on July 4th.  I have submitted an outage report to the ISO.

So, no action is required for this unit on 7/4.  The gas turbine, HRBGN_7_UNITS, 80mw, is still available.

Thanks,
Stan

Good morning 
 
Just wanted to give you a heads up that WTC voicemail was down for a short time this morning.  The link between WTC and the Qwest CO was down.  The link was reset and it seems to be back-up and working.
 
What happens when the link goes down:
 
1) The message waiting light won't go off after you retrieve your messages. If this occurs just have the person lift the handset, hear dial tone and dial,  113. This will clear the message waiting light.
 
2) The message waiting light is not on and you could have a message.    Have employees check their mailbox just in case they are expecting critical messages.  The next voicemail will activate the message waiting light.   
 
Please let me know if you have questions or concerns.

SACRAMENTO - Hundreds of local fire crews that saved homes from being

destroyed by wildfire this week are returning home today, after being

released by the Governor's Office of Emergency Services. State OES
engines will remain behind to finish what is hoped to be the final
stages of this month's wildfire fight. 

Today, with the fires nearing full containment, OES began sending
home local government engines from the Creek and North Fork fires.
Crews from the Leonard Fire will begin heading home tomorrow. The 261

engines will continue to depart the scene in parades of five,
scattered throughout the next several days, passing back across the
freeways to the 51 counties from which they came (see attachment). 

Of the nine large wildfires that started this month, it was the Creek

Fire, currently 85 percent contained, that dominated local government

and State OES Mutual Aid resources. For six days, the Creek Fire
roared across Tuolumne and Mariposa counties blackening 11,500 acres
and threatening to engulf homes in numerous communities. At its peak
deployment yesterday, OES had 260 engines and eight National Guard
helicopters on the fires.

Among its duties, State OES dispatches local government and state
fire fighting resources through the California Fire & Rescue Mutual
Aid System. The neighbor-helping-neighbor system is designed to
assist the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection,
federal wildland fire agencies, and local departments. It is also
ensures that additional resources are provided to local jurisdictions

whenever their resources are committed or insufficient for a fire.

The OES Fire and Rescue Emergency Operations Center in Sacramento
will remain activated 24-hours a day to coordinate statewide fire and

rescue efforts. At the center are representatives from OES Executive
Office, Law Enforcement Branch, Inland Region, and the California
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

The events of the last few days have been unsettling for all of us.  Some people on the floor have friends and families in New York and DC.  Many others have close business colleagues who work in downtown Manhattan.  In an effort to help people cope and deal with this terrible tragedy, we have asked Jill Nelson-Devord, an employee assistance counselor, to be on-site tomorrow, Thursday, 9/13 beginning at 8:00 am.  She will be in the Mt Rainier conference room and wandering the floor.  She is available to meet with any employee who may have concerns or questions.  Also, if you would like some advice on how you should be discussing this tragedy with your children, she is able to assist in this area as well.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, please let me know.

Amy

Karen Denne, vice president of Public Relations, received some interesting questions about Enron's dealings with the media in her eSpeak session on July 24.  Here's one of them:

I am new to Enron, and the "pie in the face" incident occurred just after I began working here. I have had several friends ask me about that. My questions are: 1) How did we "spin" this issue (i.e., the problems with Cal. AND the fact that we got pie thrown on one of our main players) 2) Was he mad about it, or did he laugh it off? 3) Is this a pie incident kind of a good thing, because it gets people talking about the issues and Enron or do we look silly?

Want to know how she responded?  Check out her full eSpeak transcript at http://ethink.enron.com/eSpeak/exec/default.asp.

John Lavorato confirmed that UBS is indeed the winner.  As I understand it, UBS has come to an agreement with Enron for the purchase of the North America Gas/Power Trading and Marketing organization.  We either have received or are expected to receive approval from the Creditors committee today.  Creditors Committee approval is considered likely as they have been in the loop on this transaction all along.  It will most likely go in front of the judge on Monday.  Approval from the judge is expected.  I have a meeting in the next couple of hour where I will get more details.  Stay tuned ...

Here is an update on new developments that have occurred over the past few days.

New Board Member & Committee Elected

Today, the Enron Board of Directors elected William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas, to the Board.  Bill currently holds the John Jeffers Research Chair in Law and the Hines H. Baker and Thelma Kelley Baker Chair in Law at The University of Texas School of Law, where he teaches tort, products liability, jurisprudence, legal process, civil procedure and contracts.  He received his J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1973.

Additionally, the Board established a Special Committee that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The Special Committee, to be chaired by Bill, comprises independent directors Frank Savage, CEO of Savage Holding LLC as chairman, Paulo Ferraz Pereira, executive vice president of Brazilian-owned investment bank Group Bonanza, and Herbert S. Winokur, Jr., chairman and CEO of Capricorn Holdings, Inc.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.

The committee has retained William R. McLucas, a former head of the Division of Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with the law firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering as its counsel.  Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering has retained Deloitte & Touche to provide independent accounting advice.

SEC Changes Inquiry to Investigation

We also reported today that the SEC has opened a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and were previously the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  This is not unusual and we welcome this investigation and are confident that this matter will finally be put to rest.

With so much publicity surrounding our company right now, I want to ask you to keep in mind that not all media reports are accurate or even based on factual information.  We are committed to communicating updates to you every day by voice mail, e-mail or both, so that you know the factual status of our company's situation.

We have created an Enron Updates Intranet site (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>) to keep you apprised of current events.  Please check back frequently for information and new developments.

I truly thank you for your continued hard work and support of our company.

Effective immediately, responsibility for the operational, environmental, safety and social audits of Enron facilities is transferred from Enron Transportation Services (ETS) Quality Management to Corporate Public Affairs under Mike Terraso, Enron's vice president of Environment, Health and Safety, and Chief Environmental Officer.  The current directors of Facility Audits, Chuck Goode and Steve Allen, will report to Mike and will be responsible for leading the corporate asset operations audits.  Technical experts from business unit operations and engineering will continue to serve on the multidisciplinary audit teams.   Audit responsibility for ETS assets will remain in ETS.

Although we hate to lose her, Holli has resigned from her position with Enron in Portland to pursue other career interests.  She will be coming in later this week or next to say her goodbyes, but other than that she will not be in.  Please refer any business or phone calls that you would have referred to Holli to me, or, in my absence, to John Malowney or Stewart Rosman.  

Thanks

As you are aware, there have recently been a number of virus attacks released and spread across the Internet. Although Enron continually readdresses and updates its virus protection procedures, new viruses will continue to be released and pose a threat to Enron's computing environment. Therefore, it is very important that all Enron employees understand their responsibilities in helping Enron stay virus free. 
If you receive a file via Email or any other means and you are unfamiliar with the sender or the purpose of the file, please do not automatically open/launch the file. One of the key elements of a virus attack is the innocent nature of its delivery.
Viruses can cause a significant amount of damage, including data loss and service outage. Viruses such as the Melissa, ILOVEYOU, AnnaKournikova, and the recent Nimda virus, caused organizations billions of dollars. Sometimes new viruses can breach the environment before the virus scanning software has been updated to detect & quarantine them. 
Every employee in the Enron organization has a responsibility to keep our computing environment virus-free.
If you believe you have a file that looks suspicious, delete it or contact your Resolution Center to obtain their assistance.

Here is today's update. Major pattern change still on the way, market consensus on this should be stronger today. California should get pounded with at least a few storms, but its still too early to tell how long this will last.

coal strike is still in effect, but 3 coal units in the province have come back in the 
last day.  demand for energy on the BC-Alberta intertie will decrease significantly 
relative to the past few days (should be close to zero by my calcs.)

     3.   Select the appropriate payroll period.
     4.   Click on the Continue button.
     5.   Click on the payroll period link under the Period heading;
     a new window opens.
     6.   Select the Open this file from its current location option.
     7.   Click on the OK button; this starts Adobe Acrobat Reader.
     8.   View your pay advice.
     9.   Click on the Print icon from the main toolbar.
   10.    Verify/change the displayed printer.
   11.    Click on the OK button to print the pay advice at the
     designated printer.  For more details on how to view & print
     your pay advice from eHRonline, see step-by-step
     instructions at http://isc.enron.com/site/doclibrary/user/

allowing you to view or print the information at your convenience.  You can
view a sample of the online pay stub by following this link to
http://hrweb.enron.com/, click on Payroll Services and then on Payroll

If you are unable to login to the Open Enrollment 2002 site online, you have another option:

Please call the Benefits Center directly at 800.332.7979.
Select option "5"
Enter the company number on your benefits worksheet (for most people, it will be 0741--not that same as the SAP company number)
Enter your login (Your SSN, followed by the "#" key)
Enter your password (Last 4 digits of your SSN, followed by the "#" key)
Use your worksheet to make your selections 

Please note: The system will walk you through the steps. It takes a little while, but HAVE PATIENCE--it's faster than waiting to access the system online!

If you have any questions, please stop by my desk -- I will be happy to assist you. 

REMEMBER: You have until 3:00pm to make your elections!

Hello all,

Amy would like to meet with each of you individually for about 45 minutes to assess your HR needs. Her schedule is fairly flexible; however, I would like to go ahead and get things set for either later this week, or early next week.

Please let me know what day and time you will be available to meet with Amy.

Thanks!

Preschedule had a heck-u-va day on Friday.  Due to many problems, some of our tags were not completed until after the 3pm preschedule deadline.  Apparently, some of our counterparties automatically deny late tags, though they may be corrections of tags made prior to the deadline.  In any case, we have a list of tags that have been submitted as real-time tags and the schedules should be treated such.  The tags and paths are as follows:

 Hello All,
            We have sucessfullly sorted some network issues in portland and the curve manager is ready to run on the
 local machine now. The terminal server can be used as a backup in case the curve manager fails on the local machine.
 I like to thank everyone for their efforts in getting this problem resolved.

 Regards

 - Arun

Effective today, you will notice many iPayit improvements.  iPayit is Enron's tool to code and approve invoices.  Your feedback has directly driven these changes, and the iPayit team and your business unit representatives are continuing to identify and prioritize future system enhancements.

Resolution Type
iPayit inbox now displays updated invoice status once all coding has been applied to the invoice.  The resolution type will display "Needs Approval".

"On Hold" Status Information
The reason a transaction is on hold and the expected resolution date can be viewed by hovering your cursor over the "On Hold" icon.

Improved Search Functions
* Streamlined search for Tax Jurisdiction Codes by entering one or more data points with fewer clicks.  You are no longer required to enter all four search criteria.
* New search boxes to generate Material Numbers and Descriptions and Functional Area Numbers and Descriptions.  You will no longer see the drop down boxes with truncated information. 

Advanced G/L Account Coding Combinations
You now have the ability to enter Balance Sheet Accounts 2, 3 series and Revenue/COGS Accounts 50, 51 series in invoice line item coding.

Dear Traders,

 I spoke with Don at Public Service Company of New Mexico again today regarding the Schedule 9 Loss Compensation Service charges.  He re-confirmed that the market price that is part of the Schedule 9 equation (Loss Compensation Service = # MW wheeled x market price x 3%) is a market price that he obtains from his marketers.  I re-confirmed that his 'marketers' are his traders, though I do not know whether these are Long Term, Cash, or Real-Time Traders.

 He is going to talk to his traders to find out where this price came from.  I brought up the point that there has been a price cap of $91.87 in the west and asked that he bring that point forward in his discussions.  

 He should respond to me on Monday 8-20-01, on which day the bill is due.

 I will keep you posted on my findings.

  Virginia

It is with regret that I have to announce that Jeff Skilling is leaving Enron.  Today, the Board of Directors accepted his resignation as President and CEO of Enron.  Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.  I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it.  I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.  I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors.
Now it's time to look forward.
With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.  I have agreed.  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible.  Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company.  We have the finest organization in American business today.  Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company.
On Thursday at 10:00 a.m. Houston time, we will hold an all employee meeting at the Hyatt.  We will broadcast the meeting to our employees around the world where technically available, and I look forward to seeing many of you there.

Subject:	Request for pre-petition payment to APS

The West Desk would like to make a pre-petition payment to APS of $43,708, in order to be able to acquire further APS transmission to Pinnacle Peak.  The transmission is required to serve a long-term, in-the-money contract.  APS is the only provider of transmission to Pinnacle Peak at this time, which may qualify APS as a "critical vendor" entitled to receive a pre-petition payment.

If we do not pay APS this money, Enron will have to buy energy at the market.  Mark Fischer estimates this will add approximately $3/MWh to the cost of delivering under this 25 MW/h, 3-year contract, compared with buying APS transmission.  This would represent a potential loss of $285,000 for this year, and as much as $1,000,000 over the term of the agreement.  

Mark has written up the details of the transaction below.

Let me or Mark know if you would like to proceed with this payment.

Steve

Subject:	APS Transmission prepetition payment

The particulars of the transaction:

We are obligated to deliver 25 MW of power to WALC at Pinnacle Peak through 12/31/04.

The company receives $45 for each MW delivered to WALC.

Pinnacle Peak is not a liquid trading hub.  There are only two utilities with facilities at Pinnacle Peak, WALC and APS.  

We are currently utilizing APS transmission to deliver energy to WALC during off peak hours. 

The cost of the APS transmission is $1.95.

The energy to satisfy this obligation is available at Four Corners under contract from El Paso Electric.  The energy from El Paso is contracted to be purchased through the end of this year under a prepetition agreement at a fixed price of $22.25.

The Transmission Service Agreement will be terminated by APS for nonpayment of  a prepetition obligation of $43,708.60.

APS is the sole party able to provide transmission to Pinnacle Peak at this time.

Absent the ability to purchase transmission from APS, the company will be forced to settle the WALC obligation at above market prices due to the illiquidity at Pinnacle Peak.  These costs could run as high as $5.  

The inablity to purchase APS transmission for $1.95 will increase the company's costs by as much as $3 over the term of the WALC obligation.

There are approximately 95,000 MWh remaining to be delivered to WALC for the remainder of 2001 on light load hours.

The increased cost to deliver would result in an additional expense of $285,000 for the remaining deliveries this year.

The increased cost for the entire term of the WALC agreement could exceed $1,000,000.

Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Honestly, I don't know - maybe a risk person could better answer.  All I know is we only give DPR in the amount of the variance between what they flashed and what we actualized ( finaled ) - Sorry I can't be of more help - maybe ask Casey Evans - A

Amy,

  For my own information, how does risk flash only ($ 67,580) worth of tranny purchases in April if EnPower was accounting for ($196,200.00) until the end of May?

Virginia - 

In April Risk flashed ($67,580) for WAPA CRSP trans.  You were also given in April , DPR of $3,495.50. This would bring your books to reflect the true/finaled amonut of $64,084.50.  The DMS variance was strictly an accounting variance - we used that to adjust to what we accrued - which was the multiplying incorrectly piece.  So no more DPR - your books should be good for April WAPA CRSP trans.

Let me know if you have any more questions - A

To Our Valued Traffic Report Clients,
 
Today, FriedWire's Traffic Report experienced a disruption in service as a result of network and general connectivity problems caused by third parties.  We apologize for this inconvenience and are working with all of our partners to insure that this does not happen again.  As always, we remain committed to providing you power markets information around-the-clock. 

Product Update 

FriedWire has just added significant new content and capability to the Traffic Report, which are outlined below.  Please contact us for brief, online tutorials on how to use the new features. 

NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Weather Forecasts 

    3-7 day Maximum Temperatures 
    6-10 day Outlook and Temperature Probability 
    8-14 day Prognostic Temperature Anomaly 
    Excessive Heat Outlooks (for the same time periods listed above) 
    Precipitation Outlooks and Anomalies 

***You may also be able to set up e-mail notification services to alert you when the new forecasts become available so that you don't have to continually check to see if the new data have been posted. 

Available Transmission Capacity 
FriedWire has developed a new interface that will allow you to search for available transmission by path.  The new geographic interface will allow you to choose a path and then view the detailed ATC offerings and then navigate to easily see reverse-path information, thru-path offerings, offerings from non-path providers and more. 

***E-mail and wireless text-paging notification services are now available along with the new ATC interface.  Now, you can be automatically notified when new ATCs are posted by providers or on paths that you track ongoingly.  You can custom define your alerts according to the provider, path, service increment, time period, class, etc.that you're interested in, as well as define when you want to be contacted (days of the week, time of day, times per day, etc.). 

The following additional product upgrades have been deployed: 

All hourly offerings are now reflected in military time designations. 
Hourly ATC selection reflected now as a range (i.e.; 13:00 - 14:00) instead of hour-beginning 1:00 PM. 
Eight new flowgates have been added for Sierra-Pacific Power and 74 for MidAmerican Energy.  They all have Intertie Profiles and can be located by selecting "View All Interties".  All will be located and plotted on the power flow maps in the next couple of weeks. 
 You can now add one (or multiple) e-mail and text-page addresses easily in order to get Alerts from the Traffic Report.  Simply click on the link that says "My Account" at the top right-hand corner of any Traffic Report screen and look for the link just to the right of the E-mail * input field that says Enter additional e-mails.  Go to the Add an E-mail Contact link at the bottom of the next screen. 

We hope you enjoy and find useful the new version of the Traffic Report.  Please stay tuned for more exciting additions in the near future. 

Sincerely, 

Bill Townsend 
President 
FriedWire Inc.

I do remember this deal, we were forced to bookout by some a-hole at pinwest because of the disaster and our inability to secure a scheule from DYPMI and Morgan who was upstream of AEP who was scheduling from home (as was I).  Tom  did the deal with Pinwest our buy for $40, and I did the deal with DYPMI our sale at Index.  I told the SW guys about this the following day, and in the mayhem, the deals probably did not get put in.  Holden and Tom and Mark were all aware of this at the time, and one of them may have also modified our deal with DYPMI.

They can throw those deals in, or I can.  Just let me know.

Cara,

I have a dispute  from Pinnacle West for Sept 12 at $40.  I've checked the sheets and the deal is in the sheet, but there is no deal number.  This leads me to believe that there isn't a deal in Enpower.  The deal is PV HV and Staci remembers the problem.    

Let me know when we can talk about this

Several changes have been made to Stack Manager and the website. These changes are outlined below and will be visible by all as of Monday September 3, 2001.


Stack Manager Changes

Activate/Inactivate Stack - This functionality allows the trader to pull a product's prices from the website without suspending the product. If the Top of Stack limit order functionality is activated for a particular product this should be used to pull the stack prices from the website without pulling the entire product; therefore, if there are top of stack limit orders against the product they will remain visible and transactable on the website. 

If a product's stack is inactivated the font for that product will be grayed out in stack manager. If the stack is active it will appear in black font.

To use this feature, select the product, right click and choose "Inactivate Stack". When you are ready to reactivate your prices, select the same product, right click again and choose "Activate Stack". There are also icons on the tool bar at the top of your screen which will Activate/Inactivate the stack of the highlighted product. See screen shot below for the icons.

					 

Changes to Product Properties - Currently when modifications are made to certain properties within the product properties screen, the product will be suspended and pulled from the website. Now instead of being suspended, the product's stack will become inactive. Once the changes have been made and saved to the properties of a product simply click the Activate Stack icon as discussed above.


Website Change

Restrictions on Top of Stack orders - If Top of Stack limit orders are allowed on a product, but the trader is not showing both a bid and offer, limit orders will not be able to be placed on that product.


If you have any questions please call me at 31787. Thanks.

Savita

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Weather Risk Management
The weather risk management group recently completed two deals. The first one was a four-year rainfall put that offered protection to an agricultural company from lower than normal rainfall levels. The second deal was a rainfall cap with Grubbs Construction Company. This option helps Grubbs shield their increased costs associated with above normal rainfall. Both deals were innovative and unique to these industries. Partho Ghosh was the originator for both transactions.

Enron Industrial Markets
EIM Steel closed 2 transactions with Duferco (an international steel producer having facilities in Belgium, Italy, South Africa and United States). The first transaction is a hedge against 201 with a 100,000 ton long position and 200,000 ton free calls for material already in Pennsylvania.  The second transaction provides a 20-year tolling right for 900,000 tons per year giving EIM Steel access to US Steel products in Western Pennsylvania.

Charity gets a time at bat from Enron
By GREG HASSELL (Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle/October 2, 2001)
When Houstonians gather at Enron Field this week, Barry Bonds' attempt to rack up 71 homers in a single season won't be the only unprecedented feat on display. 
Just above the scoreboard that will record any homers Bonds might send screaming out of the ballyard is a sign bearing the United Way logo. It looks ordinary enough, like the dozens of other ads that dot the stadium. 
But the last time the Astros played at home, the sign bore the Enron Corp. logo. Late last week Enron donated the sign to United Way, which will get the space through the 2002 season. It's the first time a naming rights sponsor of a modern U.S. stadium has donated a major sign to charity. 
According to advertisers familiar with rates at Enron Field, the sign is worth about $500,000 a year. Since Enron maintains a small logo on the sign, the actual value of the gift would be less. 
"This tells the world that, as powerful as Enron is, they put a lot of stock in what we do," said Jackie Martin, president of the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast. "That's beyond the power of dollars. It's priceless."

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron's Cross-Selling Initiative Starts to Pay Off
A major cross-selling initiative within Enron Europe is becoming increasingly successful, as more and more customers are encouraged to broaden their relationship with the company to increase the number of commercial opportunities. 

The initiative is being co-ordinated by Bob Manasse, Vice President Origination, EES Europe, and aims to maximise business relationships, develop multiple transactions and increase revenue with a single customer.

"The co-operation of the various Enron teams involved so far has been very positive and the work we've done with Pirelli (Ed. - see our second last edition of GlobalFlash!) is a good example of what we're able to achieve with cross-selling, " said Bob. "Pirelli had an existing relationship with Enron through the metals group and as that relationship has flourished, we've been able to secure plastics trades and a three-year EES deal for energy efficiency projects, with a right-to-match supply contract in Italy and the UK."

Pirelli is now discussing further opportunities with EnronOnline and Enron Credit. Similarly, Abbey National has agreed a deal with Enron Credit and is now discussing  potential deals with EES and the weather desk. 

Other big names Enron is targeting include: Siemens (discussions with EBS, EES, Enron Credit, EnronOnline, Enron Petrochemicals and Plastics, Enron Pulp and Paper), British Airways (discussions with EBS, EES, Enron Credit, renewables team, weather desk), Ford (discussions with EES, renewables team) and Safeway (discussions with EES and weather desk).

Work is also being done with the Global Sourcing Group to improve cross-selling by leveraging the existing relationships Enron has with its suppliers. For further information on cross-selling opportunities or ideas, please contact Bob Manasse (ext 34963) or Stephanie Hess (ext 34237).

Enron closes 6 year coal management deal in the UK with British Energy Plc. 
The innovative six-year deal provides total outsourcing of Eggborough's coal supply requirements. As part of this agreement, Enron will manage all of British Energy's existing contracts with UK coal mines (6 million tonnes) as well as provide an additional 3 million tonnes of international coal supplies. The virtual assignment of British Energy's contracts to Enron gives the UK coal team total operational flexibility in the form of weekly call and put options on all UK tonnes for the duration of the agreement.  In addition to taking advantage of quality and geographical basis spreads made possible by this arrangement, it will also add significant volumes to  Enron's growing rail transportation business. Stuart Staley captured the feeling of the coal team with the words "this is a business transformer". 

Congratulations to Riaz Rizvi, John Moran, Tiffany Cochran, Paddy Thuraisingham, Robert Quick, Paul Maley, Hector Godoy, Anastasia Karabatsos and the whole coal and freight team.

Enron's Shipping Freight desk supports Enron Metals with first freight deal
In a pioneering example of cooperation between two Enron groups, Enron's Freight trading desk in London has chartered a Handysize vessel for Enron Metals in Sydney to move 25,000 tonnes of alumina from Bunbury, Australia to China over a 30 day period.  "The advantage to the Metals group is that we can move an important cargo for one of our clients without letting the competition know we're doing it," explains Max Sobol, the Enron Metals trader, based in the Sydney office.   Michael Schoenig, based on the Freight desk in London, managed the port-to-port logistics for the cargo and adds:  "We were very pleased to be able to demonstrate our expertise in this fast-growing area of Enron's business.  We'd also be glad to speak to other groups within Enron who need to move freight around the world too."

Greece Power Licence Awarded
Congratulations to our South Eastern European team! The Greek Regulatory Authority for Energy (RAE) has announced that it will grant an electricity power trading licence to Enron's Greek subsidiary Enron Power MEPE. The five-year licence, which takes effect from October 1, 2001, allows Enron to approach customers consuming more than 100GWh of electricity up to a combined total peak capacity of 350MW. 

ATEL, CINERGY and ENEL were the only other successful recipients in this first-ever round of licences to be granted to external parties. Electricity will be imported through Greece's northern borders and via the new submarine Italy/Greece interconnector when it comes online at the end of 2001.

Cefn Croes Windfarm Project Clears Local Planning Hurdles
Enron Wind has cleared the final local planning hurdle with Ceredigion County Council in relation to its plans for a ?35 million windfarm at Cefn Croes in Wales. The council's planning committee had voted in favour of the windfarm itself but had reservations about the separate application for overhead power lines to connect the development to the National Grid. Joint developers Enron Wind and the Renewable Development Company revised and resubmitted their plans, winning the approval of councillors who voted 14 - 5 in favour of the new scheme.

The final decision on both applications will be made by the Department of Trade and Industry. The Cefn Croes windfarm, 16 miles outside Aberystwyth, would have an output of 58.5 megawatts from 39 turbines, and supply around one per cent of Wales's electricity.

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Good Afternoon,

Although Real Time is forced to live in a quasi-communal way, I would ask that you please do not treat the prescheduler desks as part of the commune.

Lisa, Stacy, and Susie all have their own labled chairs, and items on their desk.

If you need to logon to their computers, we ask that you please respect that these are their permanent desks and refrain from the following:

Failing to log off the computer when you leave.
Failing to clean up spilled food and used beverage items.
Adjusting chairs.
Removing the name stickers on chairs.
Removing items from desks without consent.

All of these issues have been a problem in the past, and I hope will not continue to be a problem in the future.

If you have questions or comments regarding this,  please feel free to talk with me.

Cara

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

EBS Joins EWS
Effective, July 12, EBS has become a business unit within Enron Wholesale S=
ervices.  All EBS commercial support functions will be integrated into thos=
e units within EWS, which enables us to better manage the resources and cos=
ts of the support functions.

All EBS commercial functions have been consolidated into the following unit=
s:
Europe - headed by Matthew Scrimshaw
Asia - headed by Anthony Duenner
Americas - headed by Rich DiMichele

Additionally, the North American EBS origination teams have been consolidat=
ed into one group, led by Stewart Seeligson.  North American trading and ri=
sk management will continue to report to Paul Racicot.  Paul will also over=
see the global portfolio from a risk management perspective.

Global Network Operations will continue to report to the EBS Office of the =
Chairman.

All EBS asset positions will continue to be reviewed and repositioned to mo=
st effectively meet the future needs of EBS and the Portland office will be=
 closed by October 1.


Global Strategic Sourcing
Effective July 1, a number of measures and recommendations have been implem=
ented to reduce expenditures associated with, among other things, travel an=
d entertainment, and professional services.  Global Strategic Sourcing ("GS=
S") will undertake this very important initiative and they would like to en=
list your support in the implementation of these new procedures.

This message will focus on Travel and entertainment.  Next week's message w=
ill focus on professional services.

Travel and Entertainment - Enron has a tremendous opportunity to save on tr=
avel and entertainment expenditures by making some relatively painless adju=
stments.

?=09Air Travel - Air transportation is the single largest component in the =
travel mix.  In recognition of this fact, a number of significant discounts=
 have been negotiated with all of the major carriers.  There are two separa=
te channels available to employees to access the Enron-negotiated fares.  T=
he first is Travel Agency in the Park ("TAP"), or the GSS-approved preferre=
d travel agency for your location, and the second is the new Enron-managed =
online travel booking service, ClickTrip, located at <http://clicktrip.enro=
n.com/enron>.

Over the coming weeks, GSS will be promoting training and usage of ClickTri=
p, as the primary method of booking domestic U.S. travel for a number of re=
asons.  First, excluding proprietary carriers like Southwest Airlines, Clic=
kTrip provides employees easy access to all travel and pricing options for =
their destination, including the Enron-negotiated fares.  Second, industry =
data shows that employees will generally make the most cost-effective trave=
l decision when presented with the relevant facts.  Conservatively speaking=
, we estimate that a 20% savings in airfare is attainable through the use o=
f this tool alone.  Third, it is relatively painless to use.  Fourth, Click=
Trip is accessible 24X7 from any internet-enabled personal computer and aft=
er-hours telephone support is available. If you have travel-related questio=
ns, please contact Tracy Ramsey at ext. 6-8311.
=20
One final air travel reminder worth promoting: For employees who fly in the=
 United States, use of non-refundable coach tickets generally runs 65 perce=
nt less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying=
 a $100 fee.

?=09Lodging and Car Rental - GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a n=
umber of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate your business=
 unit's individual hotel policy. Additionally, preferred car rental rates i=
ncluding insurance coverage with National (U.S. and Canada) and Alamo (U.S.=
) have been negotiated for your use.  More detailed information is availabl=
e regarding both programs through our travel site located at <http://travel=
.enron.com>.

Enron Industrial Markets - Forest Products
EIM began trading in the physical markets for Forest Products (newsprint, p=
ulp, recycled paper, and lumber) in August, 2000 and Steel in January, 2001=
.  Since then EIM has handled over 140,000 tons of recycled paper, 180,000 =
tons of newsprint, 150,000 tons of pulp, 160 million board feet of lumber, =
and 210,000 tons of steel.  Currently on a weekly basis, EIM is moving appr=
oximately 20,000 tons of forest products (newsprint, pulp and recycled pape=
r), 3 million board feet of lumber, and 10,000 tons of steel products throu=
ghout the world. =20

Due to much larger volumes of forward trading, EIM is expanding its physica=
l product delivery capabilities around the world to physically handle 5 mil=
lion tons per year.  The EIM Logistics Group coordinates the activities of =
customer service, supply and demand matching, scheduling of owned assets, a=
nd physical transport and warehousing.  These activities are primarily coor=
dinated through the Houston office, with additional resources in London and=
 Singapore.

Additionally, EIM owns paper mills in Quebec City and New Jersey which have=
 a combined production capacity of 750,000 tons of newsprint per month, and=
 a cold rolling steel mill in Arkansas with capacity of 400,000 tons per ye=
ar.  Each of these facilities includes Logistics resources that are coordin=
ated through the EIM Logistics Group.

Enron Global Markets - LNG
Enron Global LNG has enhanced its Atlantic Basin LNG supply portfolio with =
volumes from Nigeria LNG Limited (NLNG).  Enron Global LNG recently signed =
a Memorandum of Understanding with NLNG for delivery of 1 BCM/ year (billio=
n cubic meters) or (97,000 Mcf/day) from the NLNG Plus Project.  This is a =
two train expansion of NLNG's existing Bonny Island LNG production facility=
.  The expansion is scheduled for completion in 2005.  This deal represents=
 a major step in the establishment of Enron's global LNG network.

EGM - Finance & Structuring
On June 29, 2001, Enron Global Markets - LNG Group successfully completed t=
he divestiture of its 100% equity interest in Progasco, to CHDR, Inc. via a=
n all cash transaction.  Progasco sells and distributes LPG to commercial a=
nd industrial clients, and independent resellers, through a fleet of tanker=
 trucks, bobtail trucks and 13 filling plants throughout Puerto Rico.  CHDR=
, Inc. is the record and beneficial owner of all of the issued and outstand=
ing shares of stock of Tropigas de Puerto Rico, Inc. ("Tropigas").  Upon co=
mpletion of this transaction, Tropigas, hitherto the 3rd largest market pla=
yer will operate the newly consolidated entity and control a 35% market sha=
re, becoming the 2nd largest Puerto Rican LPG marketer.=20

The sale proceeds of approximately $14.3 million, have been split between P=
rotane (a wholly owned Enron Corp. Delaware subsidiary) and San Juan Gas (S=
JG), and were used to pay down inter-company debt owed to SJG and Pro Carib=
e.  The net (pre-tax) gain recorded on the transaction was $3.9 million.=20

The profitable sale of this strategic asset allows EGM to exit the retail p=
ropane business it inherited through the 1985 merger of three companies: Pr=
otane, Petrolane and Imperial Gas, and will enable Enron to better deploy t=
he cash received and more efficiently manage its Puerto Rican human resourc=
es.=20

EGM - Weather
The Weather group just completed a deal with People's Energy to protect the=
m against lower gas prices during a warmer than normal winter.  This innova=
tive winter protection was structured to manage People's exposure to both t=
he volume and price of natural gas.  Greg Penman and Bob Beyer, from the Ch=
icago office, were the lead dealmakers for this transaction.  Simlar deals =
with other counterparties are expected to come over the winter season.
Also, the Weather Group has started exploring new opportunities with EES.  =
To support this effort, Elsa Piekieniak has joined the group.  Elsa is look=
ing for several people to help her with this initiative.  If you're interes=
ted in a position, please contact Elsa.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

UPDATE ON ENRON EUROPE'S CONTRIBUTION TO 2ND QUARTER RESULTS
Congratulations to all staff for your contribution to another fantastic qua=
rter! =20

By now we hope you will have had an opportunity to read about Enron's Q2 ea=
rnings, which were released to the investment community in Houston on Thurs=
day, 12th July.  Overall the business has seen continued strong growth with=
 revenues increasing to over $100 million in the first half of the year up =
from $30 million for the same period last year.  Earnings per share this qu=
arter also exceeded analyst expectations and came in at $0.45 for the quart=
er up from $0.34 for the same period last year.

Equally important, however, is the vital role Enron Europe played this quar=
ter in contributing to the company's overall results.   We are seeing some =
terrific trends here in Europe - notably, on the wholesale side, the Contin=
ental, UK and Nordic power and gas teams keep going from strength to streng=
th as we see exceptional growth in volumes and transactions continue this q=
uarter.  Total physical and financial settled volumes for gas and power in =
Europe have seen an increase of 172% in the first six months of the year co=
mpared to the first six months in 2000 and the total number of transactions=
 per day has risen to 604 from 272 last year.  Specifically, UK power volum=
es are up 204% to 147 TWh in the first six months of 2001 from 48 TWh in th=
e same period last year.  Continental gas volumes have grown from 351 Bbtue=
/day in 2000 to 1,390 Bbtue/day in 2001 - a 296% increase - and Continental=
 power volumes have seen growth of 360% with volumes rising from 18 TWh in =
the first six months of 2000 to 83 TWh for the same period this year.  The =
growth in volumes is not simply limited to the UK and Continental markets, =
however, as Nordic power volumes have increased by 153% from 29 TWh to 73 T=
Wh in the first half of 2001.

The success stories are not just limited to gas and power trading, however,=
 and abound throughout the business:

Enron Energy Services
The retail business has experienced a real boost this quarter with the clos=
ing of EES' first, major "marquis" brand energy outsourcing transaction wit=
h supermarket giant, J. Sainsbury plc.  Of equal importance, Enron Direct's=
 business continues to grow with total customers now in excess of 160,000. =
 The success of Enron Direct's business model has translated into the devel=
opment of new business on the Continent in the Netherlands and Spain and, m=
ore recently in North America, with the 2nd quarter opening of Enron Direct=
 Canada. =20

Enron Credit
A year after Enron Credit's launch, the total life to date notional value o=
f transactions has surpassed $11.8 billion and in the 2nd quarter alone, En=
ron Credit generated $10.4 million in EBIT.  Further, more than 20,000 read=
ers per week view the Enron Cost of Credit (ECC) through independent public=
ations.  =20

Enron Australia
With 2nd quarter power volumes up 177% from the first three months this yea=
r, Enron Australia is gearing up for a strong growth year.  With the develo=
pment of a physical power position key to expanding Enron's power trading i=
n Australia, work began this quarter to identify and begin the initial purs=
uit of asset development projects.  Other businesses undergoing significant=
 expansion this quarter were coal, renewable energy credits and weather der=
ivatives.=20

Spain:  Arcos
The Arcos asset development project in Spain continues to make great progre=
ss with third party access to gas supplies for the power project being succ=
essfully negotiated this quarter, plus the project achieved another milesto=
ne in the permit/government approvals arena with the granting of its water =
concession in Q2.

UK:  ETOL
ETOL, a long-standing contributor to Enron Europe's earnings, generated yet=
 another profitable transaction this quarter with the signing of a series o=
f deals with chemical giant Du Pont for supplies at Wilton International. T=
he transaction further strengthens Enron's relationship with Du Pont, one o=
f ETOL's largest customers, and will extend the current steam and power sup=
ply contract through 2010. =20

Enron Metals
A year after entering the metals business, Enron Metals has seen increased =
volumes of 130% in its merchant and financial trading operations this quart=
er with volumes up to over 3.5 million tonnes as compared to just over 1.5 =
million tonnes in the 2nd quarter last year.  Not only has the team seen po=
sitive growth in volumes this quarter, but they have increased their share =
of trading on the LME by 50% and are making significant progress with Proje=
ct Salem - a major IT and systems improvement project that will streamline =
deal capture and risk management for metals transactions.  Finally, the met=
als team achieved a true home run this quarter when they closed a major ten=
-year origination transaction that, through the addition of smelting assets=
, will enable the metals team to improve its trading position.  The transac=
tion proved to be the perfect opportunity to leverage all of Enron's tradin=
g and origination capabilities and involved input from a number of groups a=
cross Enron.  =20

Looking to the future, we have every expectation that the strong growth we'=
ve witnessed in Europe for the first half of the year will continue through=
 end 2001.  So, in the words of Solomon Smith Barney analyst, Ray Niles, wh=
en talking about Enron's European wholesale operations results this quarter=
, "Europe is kicking butt and it's about a quarter of [Enron's] activity, n=
early double what it was last year.  And, that is a new market that is the =
size of the US." =20

Jim,
 
Glad to see to see we are doing transactions.  It would be much faster to communicate directly with the person doing the trades or supporting the trade.  I am a Mid-marketer on the commercial side and have no role in deal settlement.  
 
Thanks,
Chris

We will try to work with all of you the best we can, but please understand that it will be on a case by case basis. We have been asked to ensure that we meet these deadlines as often as possible.

Hi Guys -

  Here is a revised version of that charge split between the ST-SW and ST-WROCKIES books:

     

   FYI  --  Public Service Company of New Mexico charges ancillary as follows:

  Schedule 1    Scheduling, System Control, and Dispatch Services -  $0.047 per MWh
  Schedule 2    Reactive Supply and Voltage Control - $0.066 per MWh
  Schedule 9    Loss Compensation Service - $3.00 per MWh.  This $3 is based on a $100 market price x 3%.  I have disputed this charge, arguing that the market (and as you mentioned the Cap) is well below $100.00.  I should be hearing from them soon and I will let you know when I do.  That could bring down  your total ancillary cost from July 2001 going forward.
  New Mexico Gross Receipts Tax - 5.75% of gross charges for the month.  This taxes applied to all schedules that remain within New Mexico. )For   example from Four Corners to San Juan).


Attached is a spreadsheet outlining this month's charges as of today (not accounting for any changes that may come in response to my dispute).

Let me know if you have any questions.

Virginia

As you are all aware, Enron and UBS have entered into an agreement for the sale of certain assets of the wholesale gas and power trading organization.  As part of that agreement, the management of UBS may speak to you over the next several days about an opportunity in that new organization.  If so, we encourage you to consider such an offer. However, if you are not employed by UBS, you remain an Enron employee.  If you have specific questions regarding your employment arrangements and job responsibilities please contact Anne Labbe in Human Resources at 5-7809, or feel free to contact either Jim Fallon or Dave Delainey directly.

The Fall Associate and Analyst Recruiting Super Saturdays are scheduled for Saturday, Nov 10 and Saturday, Nov 17.  The candidates arrive on Friday, are given a tour of the Floor and then presentations will be held thereafter.   The November 10 Event will be Analyst-level candidates.  The November 17 Event will be Associate-level candidates.

Now, here's the real info!    :  )

On both Fridays (Nov 9 & Nov 16) we will be sponsoring a get together (Happy Hour) at the Heathman for all the Associates & Analysts .  This means FREE drinks and food from 4:30 PM ---> 6:30 PM.  This will give you an opportunity to meet the candidates, check them out and if necessary "sell" them on Enron.

We will be sending out more reminders and confirmations, but block out your calendars for these two Fridays.  Let me know if you have any questions!

We just experienced an outage of around 7 servers for 1.5 minutes.
 
Cause:
 
One of our master network switches crashed and rebooted itself making the device attached to them unavailable.
 
The Servers themselves did not crash, just there connection to the network.
 
The Network Team is looking into why this happened.

Do you like golf? 

Do you like kids?

How would you like to put the two together, AND 
earn a free day-pass to the 2001 Fred Meyer Challenge  
at The Reserve Vineyards & Golf Club?

--------------------------------------------------

Metropolitan Family Service (MFS) will be running several fund-raising activities during 
the Fred Meyer Challenge, August 5-7, at The Reserve Vineyards & Golf Club. 
Proceeds will help support MFS programs for children, families, and the elderly.

MFS needs your help! 
Volunteers are needed to help run these fund-raising activities!
Each volunteer shift is three hours in length and includes a lunch ticket, shirt, parking pass 
& credentials (for the volunteer day), as well as an additional day-pass to the Challenge.
At this time, volunteers are needed for Monday & Tuesday (7-10a, 10-1p, 1-3p shifts), 
although some Sunday shifts slots are still available (11-2p, 2-5p).

The duties are simple: 
greet and register participants, 
collect/handle money, 
keep scores, 
distribute prizes, 
and other easy tasks

You can have fun, work with kids, and 
help raise money for a great organization--all at the same time!

Are you interested? 
Please contact Tiffany Dean at MFS (tiffanyd@metfamily.org) or let me know (x8321).

Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."

He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."

Here is an update of some recent Enron developments.

Enron Europe Closes Certain Operations

Following Enron's credit rating downgrade yesterday and the impact that had on Enron Europe's ability to trade, Enron Europe has asked a court to appoint an Administrator.  What this means is that PricewaterhouseCoopers has been appointed the Administrator to handle the liquidation of the company's major physical assets and trading positions.  This action does not include Enron Credit, Enron Direct, Enron Metals, Teesside Power Station or the utilities and service businesses at the Wilton chemical complex.  It also does not include Wessex Water or power plants in Turkey, Italy and Poland.

Efforts are being made to preserve as much of the business as possible.  There is already interest by outside parties to buy Enron Europe's metals business, and negotiations are expected to lead to a successful deal in the near term.

This action will impact a significant number of Enron Europe's employees.  Every effort is being made to retain as many employees as possible who are part of businesses that may be preserved.

Enron Appoints New Board Member

Yesterday, Enron announced the election of Raymond S. Troubh to the Board of Directors.  Mr. Troubh will chair a newly-formed Special Litigation Committee of the Board to evaluate claims in shareholder and other derivative lawsuits.  He will also serve on the Special Committee set up to investigate all of the SEC-related matters.  Mr. Troubh is a financial consultant in New York City and has been a non-executive director of more than 25 public companies.  Board member William C. Powers, Jr. will also serve on the Special Litigation Committee.

Enron Evaluates Dividends

Today Enron announced that it is evaluating whether previously declared dividends will be paid on Enron common stock and other Enron equities.

New Enron Employee Q&A

A new Q&A has been posted to <http://home.enron.com/updates/> based on recent developments and employee concerns.

Please note that Risk has changed the mapping of WestWing 230KV and WestWing 500KV deals to be valued against WestWing curve now.  The "unreal" curve shift you observed on your 10/5/01 P&L has been corrected on your 10/8/01 P&L.  Please let us know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Fran

Importance:	High

Dear Zhiyun and Norman:

Due to legal reasons we are in the process of changing deals with delivery point of WestWing to either WestWing 230KV or WestWing 500KV.  However, in PortCalc if the delivery point is changed to WestWing 230KV or WestWing 500KV the deals will be valued against WSCC-S curve, not WestWing curve.  Due to this we have observed unfavorable prior day and curve shift; this is not what our traders expected and wanted the deals to be valued.  An example is deal#802862.1 in which delivery point was changed from WestWing to WestWing 500KV on 10/5/01 and we suffered a $294K loss due to the deal change.  (post id 13377 on 10/5/01 vs. post id 13337 on 10/4/01)

We would like the deals to be still looking at WestWing curve when delivery points are WestWing 230KV or WestWing 500KV.  Please change the mapping of the valuation in PortCalc so the traders can get their deal change and "unreal" curve shift back.  

Please let me know your timeline on this and if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Fran

At the all-employee meeting two weeks ago, I talked about the major challenges that I believe Enron is currently facing and what we are doing to address these issues.  I also reviewed with you our vision for Enron to become "The World's Leading Company," and what that means to me.

Your management team and I remain committed to this goal and are confident that by working together, we can achieve this vision.  After the all-employee meeting, a number of you came forward to voice your concerns about what you saw as additional challenges for Enron, and for that, I thank you.  We have already begun working on many of the concerns you expressed.  Now, I would like to hear from more of you about what you see as the most critical issues facing Enron in the next twelve months.  In other words, "Lay It on the Line" for me by completing the attached survey.

I assure you that your individual answers to this survey will remain confidential.  The new Management Committee will use this information to help us identify immediate action steps to address your key concerns.  We will communicate the results to you, both positive and negative, and what we plan to do about them, as soon as we can.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets is again teaming up with The Society of the Plastics Industry Inc. trade association to organize its second educational seminar on risk management for the industry. It will be held from 8:30 a.m. to 12 p.m. on Thursday, Nov. 15, at Plastics Encounter in Atlanta, Georgia International Convention Center. 

Enron's risk management services provide plastics processors with customized financial products to help them manage their raw material and energy costs.  Risk management products can protect processors from extreme price movements, minimizing earnings volatility and facilitating cash flow predictability.  They also enable processors to increase pricing flexibility for their customers.   Plastics Encounter Atlanta, formerly known as Plastics Fair, is a plastics industry trade show with a strong conference component and unique networking opportunities. EGM will have a booth at Plastics Encounter.

Enron Global Liquids
Enron Global Liquids will begin trading physical polypropylene and polyethylene plastics.  This marks a huge step forward toward bringing a complete portfolio of solutions to this vibrant, cyclical, ubiquitous, 200 billion pound, industry. This is a great example of how EGL can apply the extremely successful Enron model (with physical, price risk management, and financing elements) to its commodity markets.
  
The company will trade all commodity grades of polypropylene and polyethylene, the products used to manufacture such everyday items as packaging, grocery sacks, car bumpers, gas tanks, berber carpet, shampoo bottles, and bread bags among thousands of other items.


IN THE NEWS
UK: ANALYSIS-LME members survey hard choices ahead.  
By Martin Hayes; 10/18/2001 from Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.
LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange (LME) faces stormy times a year after demutualisation as members ask where their future lies - with electronic screens, on an open-outcry trading floor or even in some other type of business. 
The debate is happening as the global metals industry gathers in London for the LME's annual dinner week, which this year will be a subdued affair.
"LME week will struggle to surprise against a backcloth of military action in Afghanistan, dismal economic data, forlorn price sentiment and optimists rarer than hen's teeth," analyst Nick Moore of J.P. Morgan Securities said. 
A veteran trader said, "It is going to be a less-populous affair this year. The people that have to do their annual deals will still be there, but we have noticed that people are not traveling unless they have to." 
The downturn in the economic cycle has hit the world's largest non-ferrous metals market hard. Years of volume growth have ended, prices have fallen to lows and shrinking revenues and commissions have pared many brokers' profits. 
MitsuiBussan has scaled back activities and no longer makes markets, ScotiaMocatta has left the floor and blue-blooded N.M. Rothschild has simply quit the non-ferrous metals business. 
LME trading remains dominated by the price discovery mechanism of the open-outcry official rings, but electronic systems have made deep inroads over the past year. 
"The trade is rapidly being condensed into the three screen mediums. Enron, Spectron and LME Select," a director at one broker said.

Do you ever get the feeling that the idea you posted into the Idea Vault isn't looked at by anyone or going anywhere?  Well, listen to this.  Steve Gullion, EES IT manager, deposited an idea about economic data derivatives.  And guess what?  The Xcelerator liked the idea so much that they are now working on a business plan.  
Go to the Thinkbank (http://nahou-lnapp01.corp.enron.com/eThink/Thinkbank.nsf/HomePage?OpenPage) now and post the idea that has been brewing in your brain!


We've all heard Jeff Skilling say we need to "earn our way out" of the current Enron share price slump.  One way we can accomplish this is by doing a better job of managing company expenses.  Ask Kevin Hannon, CEO of Enron Global Asset Services and Policy Committee member, all your questions about how we can earn our way out, together.  Tuesday, June 19 on eSpeak at 10 a.m. Houston time.

Can't make the live event?  No worries.  Go to eSpeak (http://ethink.enron.com/eSpeak/exec/default.asp) now and submit your question.  Kevin will try to answer it during his event and you can read the transcript later.


After Kevin's eSpeak, we'll be opening a category in  eMeet http://nahou-lnapp01.corp.enron.com/eThink/eMeet.nsf called "Cost Savings Initiatives" so you can continue talking amongst yourselves and helping Enron save.  (And if you've got some great cost saving ideas, don't forget you can put them into the Idea Vault in the ThinkBank!)

Subject:=09Loss Tag Reminder

Transmission Customers:

The Western Area Colorado Missouri control area (WACM) has just implemented=
 a new scheduling package and thought this would be a good time to offer a =
reminder about how loss energy tags for delivery to WACM are to be complete=
d.

1.  Please ensure that "WACM" is the last PSE on the tag.  This is importan=
t as it provides proper credit to the Transmission Customer for losses deli=
vered.
2.  In the 'Comments' field, please put the words "WACM Losses".  If the ta=
gs are for a real-time transaction from the previous week, please indicate =
the date; i.e., "WACM Losses for MM/DD/YY".
3.  Prescheduled transactions require a concurrent tagging of loss energy t=
o WACM.
4.  Real-time transactions require a return of loss energy to be accomplish=
ed same day, next week, same profile.
5.  It is allowable to combine losses due in any day/week/month/season on a=
 single tag if that is easier for you to do so.  WACM calculates the amount=
 of loss energy due from a Transmission Customer per day based on preschedu=
led transaction losses due on Day 0, plus real-time transaction losses due =
from day -7.

We are working with WACM Operations staff to see if, with the new schedulin=
g software implemented, we will be able to accept real-time transaction los=
s energy concurrent with the real-time transaction.  If we are able to effe=
ct that change, it will be posted on OASIS and we will get an e-mail off to=
 you immediately.

In the meantime, if you have any questions, please give me a call or send a=
n e-mail.

SACRAMENTO - Today, the Governor's Office of Emergency Services
reports that it has pulled together the largest contingent of
firefighting resources in California history since the Malibu fires
of 1993.

State OES has deployed firefighters from within 51 of California's 58

counties to battle this month's wildfires (see attachment). The 1,500

firefighters make up the second largest mass of firefighters deployed

by OES to a single incident since the Southern California Fire Siege
of October 1993. That month, OES called out 810 engines to battle
193,814 acres. This month, OES has called out 368 engines to battle
more than 100,000 acres.

State OES pulls together local government and state fire fighting
resources through the California Fire & Rescue Mutual Aid System. The

neighbor-helping-neighbor system is designed to assist the California

Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, federal wildland fire
agencies, and local departments. It is also designed to ensure that
additional resources are provided to local jurisdictions whenever
their resources are committed or insufficient for a fire.

Today, 160 fire fighters that OES dispatched to the Ponderosa Fire in

Placer County are returning to their homes in El Dorado, Contra
Costa, Nevada, Placer, Sacramento, Yolo and Solano Counties.

In all, 368 local government and State OES engines deployed by OES
remain on four fires along with eight California National Guard
helicopters. Those fires are:

?Creek Fire in Mariposa and Tuolumne counties at 11,565 acres, 60%
contained with 211 OES and local government engines. Since the fire
started 5 p.m. on Saturday it has threatened 3,000 homes.

?North Fork in Madera County at 2,710 acres, 10% contained with 10
local government engines. Since that fire started on Monday, it has
destroyed two homes, and led to evacuation orders on 210 homes.

?Highway Fire in Fresno County (Sequoia National Forest), which is
1,275 acres, 0% contained, today, with 15 OES and local engines.
Since the fire started at 6:45 p.m. on Sunday, it has destroyed three

homes, and four out buildings. 

?Leonard Fire in Calaveras County, is 3,800 acres, 30 % contained,
with 90 OES and local engines. Since the fire started at 2:15 p.m. on

Friday, three structures have been destroyed: 1 home and two
outbuildings. Evacuations have been ordered for numerous communities.



The OES Fire and Rescue Emergency Operations Center in Sacramento
remains activated 24-hours a day to provide statewide coordination of

fire and rescue efforts. Representatives from OES Executive, Law
Enforcement, Inland Region and California Department of Forestry and
Fire Protection are co-located in the Fire EOC.

Chris Calger and I will be holding a series of meetings with employees today and tomorrow to communicate what we know about how the merger with Dynegy will impact the West power operations in Portland and San Francisco.

Chris will meet with his team this morning at 9 AM in the Mt. Hood conference room.  All employees who report in to Chris' organization should attend this meeting.  In addition, Structuring, Renewables, Human Resources, and the 4th Floor Legal team should plan to attend Chris' meeting.

Tim will meet with his team this morning at 10 AM in the Mt. Hood conference room.  All employees who report in to my organization should attend this meeting.  In addition, Risk, Credit, IT, Government Affairs, and the 3rd Floor Legal team should plan to attend Tim's meeting.

If you are unsure which meeting to attend please ask.

We realize that many people are out today due to the Veteran's Day holiday (no cash trading or scheduling today).  We will have another meeting tomorrow morning for people who were unable to make it to meetings this morning.  We will announce the time and place of that meeting soon.

We recognize that the last couple of weeks have been unsettling for many people.  Our goal over the next couple of days is to get back to business as usual.  There are no mandatory layoffs planned for this office.  Chris and I met with John Lavorato, Louise Kitchen, and Greg Whalley over the weekend.  Their marching orders were clear -- go back to Portland and get back to work!  As we mentioned in the all-employee meeting a few weeks ago, this office has a reasonable cost structure and is very profitable.

Subject:	PUC Press Release Announcing Deal with Edison
Importance:	High


PUC and Edison Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising rates
The California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California Edison (Edison) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC.  The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers' costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state's role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time.  The terms of the Settlement Agreement include:
?	Edison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt.  The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment.  The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month.  The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap.
?	Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner.  If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in 2004.  Edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since Edison's annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, Edison's shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment.
?	Edison will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt.  Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers.
?	The PUC can direct Edison to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt. 
?	The PUC agrees not to lower Edison's retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered.  However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs.
?	The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if Edison's back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003. 
?	There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities.
?	Edison may make up to $900 million in capital expenditures annually.
"This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for Edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power, while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California," said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC.  "The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers."
This agreement settles a November 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by Edison against the PUC, in which Edison claimed that the Commission's actions in not providing sufficient retail rates, violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property.  Under this agreement, Edison will release the PUC from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the Commission's decisions implementing AB 1X, AB 6X, and the TURN accounting proposal.

Subject:	California Update--10.02.01:Part 2:  PUC Approves Edison Bailout

In another surprise move, the PUC approved an Edison bailout today on a 5-0 vote.  This item was not on the Commission's agenda other than as a placeholder regarding "litigation."  We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edison's SVP of Regulatory Affairs and here's a summary:

The Commission will keep current rates in place through 2003
Any "overcollection" resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $3.3 B in Edison's past due accounts (the so-called "undercollection")
If Edison collects the $3.3B prior to 2003, then rates can change
If Edison has not collected the $3.3 B by the end of 2003, the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder.  Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005.
Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $3.3 B undercollection.
Edison can keep 10% of any refunds received after the $3.3B is paid off.
Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $3.3B.
Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk.
Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs (i.e., if DWR's costs go up, the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edison's rates)
The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edison's capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structure
Edison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1) the "filed rate doctrine" and 2) the so-called "TURN" accounting method, which effectively kept the rate freeze in place.
Edison agrees to "cooperate" with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers.
The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the "special" session that the Governor recently announced

We will report back with additional details as soon as we get them.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	California Update--10.02.01:  PUC Turns Down Davis' Proposed Rate Agreement with DWR

In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC.
The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood.
Davis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis' proposed rate agreement.

What is Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC?
It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers.
It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.

What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis' proposal?
With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts.
The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably.
It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months.
Under the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California's General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January.
In short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds.
Safe to say that today's PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to "solving" California electricity crisis in shambles.

What Next?
A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support.
The bill would create a "dedicated rate component" on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue.
Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the "dedicated rate component" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget.
The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result.
All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill.  The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.
Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.
Given today's vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.

Update on Edison Bailout
Still appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another "special" session next Tuesday.

If you have any questions, just let us know.

Best,
Jeff

Dear ST_SW Traders,

FYI - 
There was a cut on deal # 622350.1 on June 2, 2001 for HE 11.  It was a real time cut that reduced the schedule from 40 MW to 25 MW.  Mirant is at fault for the cut. (our up-stream is PAC).  
We originally thought that this got booked out between Mirant and WAPA, but when I spoke with Kathy yesterday, she informed me that there was no bookout and that they want to cut the schedule.  (the people involved during the cut were Geir at EPMI, Bob at PAC, Emily at Mirant, and Jackie for WAPA (Jackie is a control area dispatcher, so she cannot do bookouts for WAPA, hence there was no bookout)).  

We have agreed that to cut the schedule will be the best for now.  They do not plan on charging us LD's (she's checking with her boss to make sure.)  We will just reduce the schedules to 25 for HE 11.

It is up to you if you want to charge LD's to Mirant for the spread.

Just wanted to let you know and get your input.

Virginia

In this incredibly difficult time, giving to others may seem implausible, if not impossible.  It can, however, lighten our burden as we help others.  

After much thought, we have decided to go forward with our Enron Elves Event. In partnership with the Salvation Army, we have adopted three underprivileged families. Enron Elves is an opportunity to provide gifts for children who would otherwise go without.   

The official Enron Elves Tree has been erected and will soon be adorned with holiday gift tags.  Each gift tag contains a gift idea for a child.  

If you would like to participate in Enron Elves, here's what you do:
?	Take a candy cane gift tag from the tree
?	Sign your name to one side of the folded gift tag and place the signed tag in the box by the tree 
?	The other gift tag needs to come back attached to the wrapped gift 
?	Bring the wrapped gift and place it under the tree

All gifts need to be wrapped and under the tree by December 18.  We will then hold a prize drawing, including Blazer Basketball tickets, for those employees who participated.  

Thank you for considering those in need during this holiday season.

SACRAMENTO - Following a tour of the fire scene in Weaverville today,

Governor Gray Davis recognized the heroic efforts of the men and
women that have been deployed to fight the Oregon Peak Fire and
numerous other fires that have plagued the state in recent weeks. 

'The men and women fighting this fire here today, and the thousands
of others that have been on the fire lines this season, are heroes,'
Governor Davis said. 'I commend you for commitment to leave your
families and help fight these brutal fires.'

Currently, 996 firefighters are battling the 1,680-acre blaze in
Trinity County. Approximately 200 of the firefighters are from local
departments outside Trinity County. They were dispatched yesterday by

the Governor's Office of Emergency Services (OES) through the
California Mutual Aid System.

Over the past two weeks, the Governor has directed OES to dispatch
more than 1,700 firefighters from 51 of California's 58 counties to
help battle blazes throughout Northern and Central California. Not
since the Southern California Fire Siege of October 1993 has OES
dispatched more firefighters in a single month. This month, OES has
called out nearly 400 engines to battle 189,839 acres in 35 fires.

In June, the Governor outlined his fire action plan for what was then

expected to be a landmark fire season. The resources announced then
that are helping today include:

?Assignment of 27 new OES fire engines to local fire departments
throughout California; 
?Four retrofitted S2-T air tankers that are the critical component of

the CDF's initial attack capabilities to keep fires small. The S2-T's

carry 50 percent more water and travel 50 percent faster than the
earlier S2-A models; 
?An additional firefighter added to 180 California Department of
Forestry (CDF) fire engines;
?Activation of five additional conservation camp crews, adding 100
firefighters to CDF's hand crews;
?Ten previously closed lookout towers are now staffed round the
clock;
?A Forward Looking Infra Red (FLIR) aircraft added to the CDF fleet
enabling CDF to map large fires in smoky conditions. The technology
can also be used to detect wildfires from the air while they are
small; and
?Participation of the California National Guard to ready its aircraft

and ground support equipment for immediate response to major wildfire

incidents.

State OES pulls together local government and state fire fighting
resources through the California Fire & Rescue Mutual Aid System. The

neighbor-helping-neighbor system is designed to assist the California

Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, federal wild land fire
agencies, and local departments whenever their resources are
committed or insufficient to fight a fire. 

As directed by the Governor, OES will continue to operate its command

center in Sacramento 24-hours a day to coordinate overall statewide
response to the California wildfires.

Hello Everyone,

	On Tuesday, Oct 2nd, a trainer from Reuters will be here to train us on the new Reuters Kobra application. This application will replace Telerate so it is pretty important to attend this training so that you can pull in the market data that you need.

	Here is how I've setup the schedule.  On Tuesday morning, around 9:30 the non-trading folks (Maria, Jeff R., Julie, Kourtney, Tim H, and Jeff Oh) will attend a class that should only take about one hour. After that, the trainer will spend time at each of your work stations giving you some personal instruction and answering any questions.

	On Tuesday afternoon, around 2:30, the trading folks (Mike Swerzbin, Tom Alonso, Mike Driscoll, Matt Motley, Mark Fischer, Bob Badeer, and Tim Belden) will attend the class. Again, this should only take about an hour.  After that, the trainer will spend time at each of your work stations giving you some personal instruction and answering any questions.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me or come by my desk.

Regards,
Paul Kane

Several generators will have energy available for the weekend because day ahead prices did not reach their thresholds so they scheduled less than the amount available.  If Real TIme prices do exceed their thresholds, please call them and buy their power and ramp them up.  Sunday looks like it will happen for a good piece of the peak hours so focus on Sunday.  You will need to inc their gen schedules.

Saturday
Delano:  			15 MW Off Peak Only.  Price Threshold  $45.  Pre-schedule 30 MW, increase to 45
Wheelabrator Martell		6 MW Off Peak Only.  Price Threshold  $50.  Pre-schedule 7MW, increase to 13
Wheelabrator Shasta		2 MW Off Peak Only.  Price Threshold  $70.  Pre-schedule 0 MW, increase to 2

Sunday 
Delano:  			15 MW All Day.  Price Threshold  $45.  Pre-schedule 30 MW, increase to 45
Wheelabrator Martell		6 MW All Day.  Price Threshold  $50.  Pre-schedule 7MW, increase to 13
Wheelabrator Shasta		2 MW All Day.  Price Threshold  $70 Pre-schedule 0 MW, increase to 2


Monday
Delano:  			15 MW Off Peak Only.  Price Threshold  $45.  Pre-schedule 30 MW, increase to 45
Wheelabrator Martell		6 MW Off Peak Only.  Price Threshold  $50.  Pre-schedule 7MW, increase to 13
Wheelabrator Shasta		2 MW Off Peak Only.  Price Threshold  $70 Pre-schedule 0 MW, increase to 2

In addition, it is possible that any of these units, or Harbor could be dispatched by the ISO pursuant to the FERC order.  This will probably not occur as the ISO will not need their energy over the weekend, but if it does, we should relay these instructions to the generator, ramp them up and put a deal in the system as we would a supplemental.  This should be a pass through for EPMI.

Thanks

Chris

I changed the following deal entry errors for the $15 flat Bloomberg Broker Fee.
These deals were entered as $15/mw instead of flat.

Holden,
Please forward me your credit card number(s) and any relevant frequent traveller information so that we can set up a profile.
Also, I unfortunately needed to book you in two different hotels in Denver. I booked Paul in the Hotel Monaco for two nights, and you in the Monaco for the second night. I have found you another hotel down the street from the Monaco for the first night. I hope that is ok.
Thanks,
Anna

Tomorrow, Grace begins her vacation to Hawaii (lucky gal!).  She will be out of the office for a little over a week.   During this time, I will also be out of the office for Assoc/Analyst recruiting for several days.  To insure that an HR resource will be available for you, Josie Jarnagin will be in our office for the next two weeks.

Josie worked with me at EBS as our HR Coordinator.  She is familiar with all of the Enron systems including payroll, SAP and Benefits.  Josie will be able to answer questions, problem-solve with you and help support our team.

Please drop by and say "Hello" to Josie.

Given all of the recent news about California-related litigation, I thought that it would be a good idea to hold an information session for people on the desk about what is happening with Enron on this front.  I have asked Richard Sanders, who is ENA's chief litigation lawyer, to make a special trip to Portland to talk to us about it.  He will be prepared to review the foundation of all of the current lawsuits that are ongoing and what these lawsuits mean to Enron and to us as traders and marketers.  

I strongly encourage you to come to this meeting as I think that you'll find it very useful. 

Date:  Thursday, June 7
Time:  3:30 p.m.
Place: Mt. Hood
Re:      Update by Richard Sanders

Please confirm with Debra that you have received this and that you intend to attend.  Let me know if you can't make it.

Many of you have requested more time in which to submit your nominations for the 2001 Chairman's Award. In response to your requests, the deadline has been extended to Friday, October 12.

Please take this extended opportunity to nominate that special individual who is your everyday hero and a role model who exemplifies Enron's core values of Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence.

This award represents how important Enron's core values are to the company. The success of this award program is determined by Enron's most valuable asset, you, the employee. Employees at any level can nominate fellow employees from anywhere within the Enron family - from the top down or the bottom up. All of those employees who have been nominated in the past are eligible to be nominated again this year and there is no limit to the number of nominations you may submit. Simply complete a nomination form and submit it by Friday, October 12, 2001. Forms can be obtained by visiting your intranet site or at home.enron.com and in Houston they are available in the elevator lobbies. In addition, this year we have a new way you can nominate that everyday Enron hero. Simply pick up the phone and dial 713-345-2492, follow the simple and quick instructions and leave your nomination by phone.

The finalists for the award, the Chairman's Roundtable, and the Chairman's Award winner will be honored at Enron's Management Conference in San Antonio on November 15.

Thank you for your participation.

It may show up in two billing cycles. You may dispute the charge by calling American Express, so that they can deduct it from your balance due.
Let me know if it doesn't show up in two billing cycles.

I regret to inform you that Ken Rice and Kevin Hannon have decided to leave Enron to pursue other opportunities.  Most recently, Ken had been assisting in the transition of Enron Broadband Services to Wholesale Services.  Kevin recently left Broadband Services to lead our Global Assets business.

In addition to building a wholesale model for the trading of bandwidth as a commodity, Ken and Kevin made significant contributions to the development of our wholesale business.  I am grateful to both of them for their outstanding service to Enron.

I am pleased to announce that effective immediately Stan Horton, chairman and CEO of Enron Transportation Services, will assume additional leadership responsibility as chairman and CEO of Enron Global Assets, excluding the South American merchant business, which will continue to report to John Lavorato.  Stan is a 28-year veteran of the company with a proven track record of outstanding results.  Enron Global Assets will continue to function as a separate unit headed by President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Hughes, who will report to Stan.

Please join me in supporting Stan in his expanded role and in wishing Ken and Kevin the very best of success in their new endeavors.

Enron's General Counsel sent out an e-mail this morning defining data and document retention policies relating to SEC Investigations and Shareholder Class Action lawsuits.  The e-mail, which appears below, goes on to explain that we should otherwise return to "our normal electronic document retention policy."

I want to remind everybody that the new document retention requirements are in addition to this office's current document retention policy.  Specifically, the policies that we have agreed to with the California Attorney General remain in effect.  As a reminder, I have included our policy below.  Each person in the Portland office needs to be aware of and continue to comply with our data retention policies. 

If you have any questions or concerns please let me know.


The purpose of this message is to update employees on the
status of the California Attorney General's order regarding the preservation
of business information.  Please NOTE THE IMPORTANT POLICIES DESCRIBED
BELOW.

Please continue to ahdere to the following business information retention policies:

(1) PERSONAL EMAIL: can be kept, discarded,
etc. at will.

(2) BUSINESS EMAIL: do not delete any
business email sent or received for 24 hours.  This 24 hour delay will allow
the network to save a backup copy of the email.  After 24 hours, BUSINESS
EMAIL may be kept, discarded, etc. at will.

(3) WORD PROCESSING FILES OR FILE FRAGMENTS:
do not delete any SAVED FILE or any FILE FRAGMENT.  This policy covers any
FILE or FILE FRAGMENT that you have saved on your hard disk or the network.

(4) DATABASES: do not delete any information
in DATABASES.

(5) EXCEL SPREADSHEETS: do not delete any
information in EXCEL SPREADSHEETS.

(6) CALENDARS OR SCHEDULING PROGRAMS: do not
delete any information.

(7) OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA: do not delete any
OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA.

(8) HARD DRIVE CAPACITY: in the event that
you run out of disk space on your personal computer, you may copy files to
the network (where they will be backed up), then delete the files from your
personal computer to create the work space you need.  DO NOT DELETE ANY FILE
BEFORE YOU HAVE COPIED IT TO THE NETWORK.

        3.      If you have any e-mails that relate in any way to the LJM Deal or Chewco Investments L.P., including any accounting issues related to these transactions, please forward the e-mails to  LJM.Litigation@enron.com.

Good Evening,

We just completed the Chapter 11 application to zero-out the schedule volume on selected deals.  The new executable is located at  o:\portland\westdesk\california scheduling\chap11.exe.

We did some preliminary testing with Phil Platter and all looks good.  We will migrate the new application to production on Monday using the traditional method so that it will be accessible from the Enpower toolbar.

Phil can show you how to create the short-cut.

Thanks,  David Poston

INTEROFFICE MEMO

From: John Lavorato & Dave Delainey

To: All of ENA and EES

Re: ENA and EES Industrial SIC Codes

As Enron continues to build its origination and customer business in the US, it is becoming increasingly important that both ENA and EES target the appropriate industries and customers with our respective value propositions.  Double coverage and duplication waste resources and damages Enron's reputation in the market place.  It is also important that the right product, solution and sales technique are utilized to ensure the maximum benefit for our customers and Enron.

Consistent with the past, EES will be focused on those SIC codes or industries that are less energy intensive and are less sophisticated in their management of energy.  ENA shall continue to target and cover those industries and customers that are very energy intensive and employ significant process load.  We ask that both organizations respect the boundary.  In those few cases where this policy is not appropriate, please over communicate to ensure close coordination between ENA and EES before customer contact. 

Effective immediately in the US and regardless of total energy consumption or number of sites, the following SIC codes have coverage responsibility in ENA.  All other industrial and commercial SIC codes and activity will be managed by EES.

ENA SIC Codes:

Primary Metals Mining and Extraction 
Oil and Gas Extraction
Paper and Forest Products
Chemicals - except for pharmaceutical, biotech and small specialty chemical that will be EES customers
Refining
Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
Plastics and Rubber Manufacturing
Fertilizer
Rail
Auto - restricted to the Big Three - Ford, GM and Daimler-Chrysler
Cement
Aerospace - restricted to Boeing, Raytheon, GE Aircraft, Allied Signal, Hamilton-Sundstrom
Large Agricultural Processing

As per our conversation, please create 2 new delivery points in EnPower -- West Wing 500 kV and West Wing 230 kV.  When these have been created, please deactivate the current West Wing delivery point.

Please let me know when this has been done so that I can create the new EnronOnline delivery point requested by the West desk.  Give me a call if you have any questions or comments.

DAILY BRIEFING -- Can UBS Tame Enron's Wild Traders?
Daily Briefing: NEWS ANALYSIS 
By Emily Thornton in New York, David Fairlamb in Zurich, and Stephanie Anderson Forest in Dallas 
Back in November, Dynegy (NYSE:DYN <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=dyn&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/d/dyn.html>) had what sounded like a great idea: Buy Enron's flagship trading business in natural gas and electricity, and immediately become the dominant force in those markets. Dynegy fled when Enron started to collapse under an avalanche of scandal. Now, Zurich [Switzerland]-based UBS Warburg (NYSE:UBS <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ubs&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/u/ubs.html>) is making the same bet, albeit for a lot less money. 
The question now: Will the conservative bank be able to impose Swiss order on the rogue Texas company's traders? On one level, the deal doesn't seem completely farfetched. Enron's gas and electricity trading actually seems to have made money. Other bankers who checked it out estimate the trading operations racked up $3 billion in pretax profits over the past two years [see BW, 2/11/02, ``Enron: How Good an Energy Trader?'']. 
Still, UBS had good reason to go for a deal that gave it 67% of future pretax profits for a pledge only to pay the salaries of 625 Enron employees. Obviously, the Enron name is mud, and getting people to trade with the company will be difficult enough. But managing Enron's swaggering traders -- its core asset -- could turn out to be even harder. 
CULTURE CLASH. Enron may be on its last legs, but its masters-of-the-universe culture lives on, say insiders. ``Even after going down in flames, a lot of these people have undiminished confidence in their ability,'' says a former Enron trader who asked not to be named. Competitors doubt that people who earned as much as $1 million a year in the freewheeling, high-risk Enron culture will be grateful to become a small piece of UBS's massive fixed-income business. 
Although many have signed contracts with UBS that prevent them from leaving Enron for an undisclosed period, ``they're all exploring their options,'' says one banker privately. Indeed, some traders are talking about trying to buy the trading unit back from UBS after it gets going again. UBS says it's not worried about rogue traders. ``We're confident in the people we have hired,'' says Michael Hutchins, global co-head of credit fixed income at UBS Warburg. 
For the scheme to work, however, UBS must persuade Enron's traders to accept its risk-management practices. And that will be tough: One reason Enron's traders made so much is that they took big risks. Analysts estimate that Enron was willing to put as much as $66 million at risk on a trade, vs. $12.2 million at Dynegy or $16 million at Duke Energy. UBS Warburg is willing to put up to $131 million at risk in all of its deals with a single trading partner, but insiders says its energy traders won't be allowed to risk ``anything like that'' on a single trade. UBS'ers abide by tighter controls than at Enron. 
``SMOOTHING ELEMENT.'' UBS officials insist that they have no rosy delusions about the investment. That's partly because they had been researching the energy-trading business for more than a year as a way of diversifying the bank's trading income. ``Earnings in the energy-trading business do not depend on developments in the capital markets, so they could work as a smoothing element,'' says UBS President Peter A. Wuffli. 
That's in fact what motivated UBS to send a small team down to Houston when Enron put the business up for sale after the bankruptcy filing. Even after federal antitrust authorities give the final go-ahead, the Swiss bank says it plans to take things slowly. ``We don't know how quickly this is going to start up,'' says UBS CEO John Costas. ``We'd be happy in the first year if this business is half as big as it had been historically.'' 
Still, anything associated with Enron is arguably fraught with risk at any price. ``It's not clear how successful UBS is going to be,'' says Jeff Dietert, an analyst at investment bank Simmons & Co. in Houston. ``And I think UBS knows that. That's why it wasn't willing to pay anything up front.'' 
Some industry insiders doubt that Enron's traders will prove to be exceptional under the new rules. But UBS isn't about to change its own way of doing business. ``Entering into energy trading does not mean extending our appetite for risk,'' says Wuffli. Swiss family Enron? Don't bet the chalet on it.

Holden, thanks for accepting our invitation to the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta!  You'll have a great time. 

As promised, I am enclosing additional information on making your trip here October 7-9, 2001.  I will also be needing some information from you.

1.  Please email me, call me or fill out the attached form and fax it back to me with your travel information as soon as you know it, so we can arrange times to meet you at the airport. 

2.  In October, Albuquerque can be very cool.  Please bring a light jacket and/or sweater, and some warm clothes, as many of the events we will be hosting are outside.

3.  You will be lodging in a Class a RV on site at the Balloon Fiesta, with one of our other guests.  There will be 3 RV's that we have secured for our guests (6 guests in all), and these RV's will be parked in our own reserved area of the Balloon Fiesta.  This way, there will be no "early rising" to attend balloon events, as some of the start times for ascension events are 5:45AM - 7:00 AM!  And you will be in midst of all of the excitement.  These RV's are top of the line: roomy, comfortable, and well-stocked with all the necessities (snacks, drinks, toiletries, sheets, blankets, towels).

4.  All meals will be hosted by us, either at local restaurants or they will be professionally catered to our area. 

We will also host an outing to Santa Fe; sightseeing and museums, or you can play golf instead (please indicate in your reply if you will be renting clubs or bringing your own).    We would also like to treat you to a balloon ride (weather permitting) if you are so inclined.  Just please note it on the attached sheet.

And last but not least, we would like you to provide us with your sweatshirt size so we can send you home with an official Balloon Fiesta sweatshirt.

I have attached to this email a form that you can either fill out and fax back to me or use it as a guide to answer all the questions that I am requesting through email.  Of course, you can still call me at 505/855-6202.  If you plan to fax this information to me, the number is 505/855-6240.

<<RSVP Form.doc>> 

All of us at PNM's Wholesale Power Marketing are thrilled that you are coming!  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.

Regards, 


Sandy Stephens

I am pleased to announce the following changes in the Global Risk Management Operations organization: 

Bob Hall will lead operations for Enron Americas. Bob previously served as one of the business controllers for gas operations for Enron Americas, with direct responsibility for Gas Logistics and Volume Management.  The leadership team reporting to Bob will include Peggy Hedstrom (Calgary Operations), Jeff Gossett ( U.S. Gas Risk and South America Operations), Stacey White (U.S. Power Risk), Leslie Reeves (U.S. Gas and Power Confirmations and Settlements), and Bob Superty (U.S. Gas Logistics). 

Brent Price will continue to lead Operations for Enron Global Markets and fulfill his dual role as Chief Accounting Officer for Enron Global Markets. 

I am very pleased to announce that Kevin Sweeney will lead Operations for Enron Industrial Markets.  Kevin brings to his new role extensive risk and operations experience from stints in our Houston, London and Singapore offices.  Kevin fills the role that was previously held by Brenda Herod, who will now report directly to Beth Apollo. 

Beth Apollo will be the Operations Project Manager for the assimilation of EES Wholesale. This will include Deal Capture, Risk Analysis,  Confirmations, and Global Data functions which have been moved into EWS under Global Risk Management Operations.  Successfully leveraging the infrastructure to support the EES business plan will also require close coordination with Gas Logistics, Settlements and the Operational Analysis (OA) process, and Beth will actively coordinate operations efforts with these teams and the commercial teams.  I have asked Beth to project manage the effort to look for opportunities to streamline and improve systems, processes and controls, and to consider alignment, where it makes sense, with existing EWS processes.  Reporting to Beth will be Scott Mills, with a focus on Deal Capture, Risk Analysis and Confirmations, and  Brenda Herod, with a focus on invoicing control guidelines and reporting requirements. 

Beth will also continue to manage the Global Services function, which includes the consolidated DPR process and Global Operations Standards, led by Shona Wilson, and the Global Data function which is lead by James Scribner.

Mike Jordan will continue to lead operations for Enron Europe, working closely with me and other EWS operations leads to insure the proliferation of best operational practices worldwide for Enron.   

Thanks for your continued support especially in exploring and seizing commercial opportunities to strengthen our contributions to Enron.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Freight Markets
Despite an eroding economy and increasing scrutiny of Enron, Enron Freight Markets finished a record month in October, completing more than 4,000 transactions (50% growth from September) and adding over 200 new counterparties.  Volumes were especially strong in the last 10 days of the month.  One of the big sources of transaction growth was increased volume from other major freight intermediaries, substantially bolstering EFM's efforts to develop a wholesale market.

Enron Global Markets
Coal 
Increased liquidity in the prompt months has brought more players into the spot rail market. Traditionally a thin market in the OTC market, the coal group is capitalizing on increased interest by introducing several new EOL rail products. On the CSX rail line, there will be two 12,500 btu products with different sulfur contents - 1.2 pound (or compliance) and 1.6 pound. The CSX contract will be FOB rail in the Big Sandy or Kanawha rail districts. On the Norfolk Southern rail line, there will be two similar 12,500 btu products, however, FOB rail in the Thacker or Kenova rail districts. The coal group intends to bring these products on line within a week for the cash book, and hopefully extend them to the forward markets.

Enron Industrial Markets
Lumber
Enron's Lumber Trading Group recorded a record 33 transactions on Clickpaper.com for the week ended November 11, 2001 for a gross notional value of approximately $1,200,000. This compares to the group's prior weekly average of 5 online transactions with a notional value of approximately $140,000.

The increase in activity is due to the launch of the Lumber Group's New Futures-Like Fixed Price Forward Contracts, which began trading last week.

"We are very excited about the overwhelming market acceptance of our new Forward Contracts which we expect will revolutionize the way lumber is traded" says John Jacobsen, a manager with EIM's Lumber Trading Group.  We expect to see continued increases in our online trading activity as we start actively marketing them. What makes this week's activity even more promising is the fact that the cash market has been fairly quiet due to the uncertainty surrounding a softwood lumber dispute between the US and Canada."

Enron Wholesale Services Best Practice Tips

Ordering/Locating SkyTel/Blackberry Items in the iBuyit eProcurement Catalog
Pagers and Accompanying Service Plans:
EWS eProcurement users should go to the catalog under Office Supplies. Enter "Skytel pagers" as the Quick Search text. Tip:  All users must select a service plan in addition to the pager.

Handheld Devices:  
EWS eProcurement users should go to the catalog under IT Hardware. Enter "Blackberry" as the Quick Search text.  Tip: No need to select a separate service plan. A service plan is combined in the catalog with each handheld device.

Information Required When Ordering SkyTel Items
Pagers and Handheld Devices:  The user's EID* and name are required for all SkyTel items. After adding the item(s) to the Shopping Cart, the requester must click the Line Item Details icon (magnifying glass) and enter the user's EID and name under the Purchase Order Text tab. The order cannot be processed without this information. This will ensure that the ongoing monthly service plan charges are assigned correctly to the user's cost center.
*If EID is unknown, users should go to eHRonline to view their EIDs. 
Tip: If you wish to swap out a pager for a handheld device, make sure to include your existing pager phone number in the PO Text.


NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Update on Enron Europe 
Following on from last week's memo on the health of the business, here's a snapshot of the activities we are pursuing currently to provide customers and investors with confidence in our business:

We are continuing to work on trading liquidity, which to date is going well.  We are transacting with most of our counterparties, but we are spending a significant amount of commercial and commercial support time working on putting credit agreements in place.  These credit agreements tend to focus on netting out exposures between different Enron business units (for example UK gas and UK power) and providing collateral arrangements whereby neither one of us can owe more than a pre-agreed amount without starting to "pay as you go".

During these tough times, our priorities right now are to: 
       -	Preserve cash (as our credit rating has been downgraded, our ability to keep maximum cash liquidity is critical).
       -	Insure that we are getting paid when we should get paid.  In other words, we are focusing efforts on accounts receivable that should have been paid and are now  overdue (something that is always important, but even more so now).
 -	Reduce our expenses to the greatest extent possible.
 -	Keep making money.

So please let us know how we can help you help us get the job done.  Remember, the key thing for Enron at present is that we put all our efforts into making money, keeping costs down and ensuring that all cash due to us is collected on time.  Focusing on the business at hand will be critical to helping us demonstrate our overall strength.

Enron Nordic Energy Restructuring
Enron Nordic Energy last week took steps to restructure its operations with respect to Finland.  Moving forward, Enron Nordic Energy will continue to service the Finnish market from its Oslo office, offering a range of products including portfolio and risk management services.  This move is not indicative of a withdrawal of Enron's business from the Finnish market, but rather has been initiated in an effort to rationalise Enron's functions and services in the region.  

Enron Succeeds in Completing its First Bi-Lateral Power Transaction Inside Italy 
Congratulations are due to the Italian desk for concluding its first power transaction inside Italy.  The team succeeding in buying 5MW of peak energy for December 2001 from Italian wholesaler, Energ.it, and are selling it to Enel Trade, the trading arm of the incumbent energy company, ENEL.  Energ.it is mainly active in Sardinia and off-takes power from the AES plant in Ottana, Sardinia.  "Although this is only a small deal it demonstrates the market's appetite to transact." says Daniela Uguccioni, Enron's Italian power trader.

"Due to the slow progress of liberalisation in Italy, we are still limited to doing back-to-back transactions such as this, however this is definitely a step in the right direction" adds Paul Mead, Director of Regional Power Trading.  "The exciting part of this deal is that ENEL will now trade with us inside Italy, something we have been trying to do with them for years."

New Online Metals Product
Last week saw the launch by Enron Metals of online 'averaging' contracts for Copper and Aluminium.  'Fixed for Float' and 'Month on Month' averaging contracts are now available for the 'nearby months' (i.e.up to three months ahead) providing a useful tool for hedgers.  The introduction of this product online, which is of particular interest for producers and consumers, came in response to customer demand.  The initial response has been positive as last week saw the first trades and we are already seeing requests for the product to be made available for other metals.

Polish Power Market Gathers Momentum as Enron Signs Second Master Trading Agreement
Enron Poland, which recently closed its first-ever OTC transaction with Poland's largest generator PKE, has signed a second Master Trading Agreement with one of the top ten regional distribution companies, Energa Gdansk.  The agreement will provide the basis for future bi-lateral electricity transactions.  "We hope to close our first deal with Gdansk in Q4", says Jarek Dybowski, Enron's director of power trading in Poland. 

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS FROM DOWN UNDER
Power Desk Sees Promising Market Growth
In the energy market, Enron Australia continues to build its presence year-on-year.  Enron Australia's results at the end of the third quarter showed a 50% increase in volumes, an 80% increase in transactions, and a 300% increase in P&L.  The advent of a competitive ancillary services market in Q4 provides scope for increasing the power team's activity further by the end of the year.

Pacific Solar REC Trade
Enron Australia has secured a renewable energy deal with Pacific Solar, a company that is developing solar photovoltaic systems for the rooftops of the world. The transaction gives Enron the right to purchase all of the renewable energy certificates (RECs) generated by the PV units sold in Australia. Pacific Solar is also selling its systems in Europe though Italian company, Eurosolare. The deal is the first exclusive offtake agreement Enron has secured in the nascent Australian REC market.

Jim,

In speaking with Ron Moulton of WAPA (Phoenix office) I have gathered the following information:

Signatories to MOU for WesTrans for-profit transco are, currently: SRP, APS, PNM, TEPCo, El Paso.  Pending, Texas/New Mexico, awaiting authority from their management.  There are no Colorado entities signed on, Excel Energy, which owns PSCO will most likely be an ITC and operate under one of the RTOs.

The Filing Utilties are meeting TODAY (10/4) with all four FERC Commissioners and FERC staff for a pre-filing briefing.  It is Ron's opinion that it is the intention of the filing utilities to position themselves as THE RTO for the west.  They feel that the first in to FERC has the best chance to form opinion and policy.

WAPA has not yet signed due to what they feel as a responsibility to their customers to complete cost-justification and environmental impact studies.

Kind Regards,

Dave

Jim,

FYI, I have spoken to Bill Dunn, the DSTAR consultant.  He has been retained by the PTOs in the desert southwest to help them complete their tariff for filing by the end of next week (Oct 12 - confirmed by Bill)

Bill's sense is that the PTOs are filing by the 12th becuase they DO want to influence the FERC on the model for the west.  This follows the PR envy scenario against the RTO West group that they have been showing since mid year.

If this is the case we need to very carefully review their LLC and TCA agreements as well as the congestion management appendix.  The others are important too, but these are the ones that are key.  Bill noted that he had issues with the PTO documents as issued and the PTOs told him that they have addressed most of his concerns.  Bill Dunn has been very good in helping make the documents as unbiased as the PTOs would let him, but we need to be vigilant.

Kind Regards,

Dave

FYI:  Bill noted that Fiona Wolf would be a panelist during FERC week.

Dave --

Do we have a strong preference for what DSTAR utilities should do?  I think that we want to communicate with OMTR and others at FERC to push a single RTO in the West (leaving CA) outside.  Also, having the Transco originally within the RTO West makes alot of operational sense and should not limit the economics of the Transco.

To All,

Below is a message from Jack King the Chair of the DSTAR Board, which describes the dissolution of the DSTAR board due to the withdrawal of funding from the PTOs in the region.

The information I received on Wednesday from Cary Deise of APS was, on Monday the PTOs voted to withdraw funding of DSTAR (as noted below).  The big 5 in the region, APS, TEPCo, PNM, SRP and WAPA have, or plan, on signing a Memorandum Of Understanding to file with FERC on October 12 a complete tariff to form a for-profit TransCo called WesCo, or WestTrans, which will be based on the documents that we have been reviewing.  Cary noted that there are several possibilities for the proposed TransCo, one was to join TransConnect in the northwest and join RTO West, simply join RTO West, or develop their own compliant RTO.  Below Jack King states that the PTOs would be forming a for-profit RTO, that was NOT the impression I got from APS.  

I will keep you posted of any developments.  If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call.

Kind Regards,

Dave

Message from Jack King, Chair of the Desert STAR Board of Directors:
I have been informed by the Transmission Owners that they plan to move
forward with a filing at FERC in the near future to create a for-profit
Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) and that they do not intend to fund
any future activities of Desert STAR.  Without funding, the Desert STAR
Board of Directors feels that it has no choice but to start dissolving
Desert STAR.
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thank all of the
stakeholders for their support of Desert STAR and to wish all stakeholders
the best of fortune in this evolving environment.

On sunday we had a problem with PSCO, they tried to back out of a purchase from El Paso since they claimed they were picking up the power at the FC 230 bus instead of the 345 bus.  Also there is an issue with the schedule being until further.  This once again highlights our need to be as clear as possible on ALL aspects of the deals that we do.  All new people should have a discussion with myself or another senior member as to the differences between the FC's busses, N. Gila vs. Devers and other points on the grid that you are unsure of.

thanks,

ryan

Sorry about the confusion.

Thanks for your help,

This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

Hello all!

We thought we would clarify the Parking & Mass Transit options:

1) Three options are available:

2WTC/Outside parking lots
- Those who park at 2WTC will continue to be set up with monthly parking deductions
- Those who park in outside lots pay out-of-pocket and submit reimbursement for up to $89.00 per month

Tri-Met
- No out-of-pocket expense or paycheck deduction.

Daily Validations
- Employees may park at any location and submit reimbursement for up to $89.00 per month.

2) You may choose only ONE of these available options.
- If you selected the mass transit option, you must pay out-of-pocket (with no reimbursement) for parking fees incurred on days you choose to drive into the office.

3) If you would like to change your parking/mass transit option, please contact Grace or Julie.

If you have any questions, please let us know.

Thanks!
Your HR Team

Subject:	Parking & Mass Transit Resolution

We have reached resolution regarding the parking and mass transit issue.  Until notified otherwise, the parking and mass transit subsidy will continue as an employee benefit. 

For those who have a payroll parking deduction, your deduction has been stopped.  No deduction should occur on 12/31/01 payroll.  In addition, you should receive a credit for the deduction taken for the 12/15 payroll.  

For those who incurred any out-of-pocket parking costs during the month of December, you may expense up to $89 for reimbursement.  

Beginning 1/1/02, parking and mass transit will continue as follows:

WTC Parking:  You should receive your parking pass in the mail. Payroll deductions will begin on the 1/15/02 paycheck. (No Action Req'd)

Outside Parking Lots:  Park at lot of your choice and pay out of pocket.  Request reimbursement of up to $89 per month. (No payroll parking deduction will occur)

Tri-Met and MAX employees:  Passes are available for January.  If you would like to pick up your pass, please see Debra Davidson.   

NOTE:  Extra Tri-Met passes are available.  If you would like to select mass transit as your parking option, please notify either Grace or myself before Friday, 12/21/01 EOB and we will insure a monthly pass is available.

Validations:  We will no longer validate parking passes, however, you are able to reimburse up to $89 per month for daily parking.

If you have any questions, please let us know!

With the formation of the Management Committee we are discontinuing the Enron Executive Committee.  Instead of weekly Executive Committee meetings with a subset of Enron's Managing Directors, we will hold quarterly meetings which will include all of Enron's Managing Directors.  These meetings will allow a wider dissemination of information and views and will enable more substantive discussions about the opportunities and challenges we face.

The members of the Management Committee will continue to meet each Monday at 11:00 a.m. (Houston time).

Attached is a short memo and summary outlining changes to the Business School Loan Program for the Western Hemisphere. As many of you know, over the past couple of months we have taken a hard look at our approach to business school loans. The updated guidelines better serve Enron's business interests, eliminate credit exposure for the company, and potentially broaden the reach of the Loan Program. If you have any questions, please contact Ted Bland (x35275) who leads Career Development for the Program.

As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. 

Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670.

At Enron, diversity is one of our strengths, and we respect and embrace all people of all faiths and beliefs.  Please continue to keep our employees who have been impacted by this tragedy in your thoughts and prayers.

Subject:	Pending FERC Order, West-wide Mitigation

The following report is comprised of what was discussed at the Commission meeting held yesterday and additional intelligence gathered from FERC staffers after the meeting.  We are awaiting the final order and will update this report as soon as it issues. Generally, the order is expected to expand the scope of the Commission's April 26 Order, and this report will highlight the differences.

Geographical Scope-  Mitigation is extended to cover all 11 western states.

Term- The term of the order will be extended to cover 2 summers.  We expect the order to issue today.  If so, the order will take effect at midnight tonight and continue in effect until 9/30/02.

Spot Market- Defined as sales of 24 hours or less, transacted on the day of delivery or the day prior to delivery.

Must Sell- To prevent physical withholding, the plan will require all sellers to offer all their available power in real time.  All California generators, even those not subject to FERC price regulation, will be required to sell into the ISO's real time market.   Sellers in the rest of the WSCC are similarly required to sell, except that they are not required to sell into California and can choose their spot market.  They will be required to post available power on the Western Systems Power Pool board.  Hydroelectric facilities will continue to be exempted.  

Price Mitigation-  Expanded to be in place 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Applies to all sellers, including marketers and non-public utilities.  The plan retains a single market clearing price auction for the spot market, based on marginal cost bids. The proxy price formula is changed in several respects:

	1.	Gas price will be the average of the mid-point of the monthly bid week prices as reported in Gas Daily 		for Malin, SoCal Gas Large Packages and PG&E City Gate.
	2.	O&M increases from $2 to $6.
	3.	Fuel start-up and emissions costs are eliminated from the formula and uplifted from the ISO (i.e. these 		costs will be recovered from the ISO, but will not go into setting the proxy price).
	4.	Similarly, a credit adder of 10% will apply, only in CA. 

A reserve deficiency in CA (7% or less) also triggers mitigation for the rest of the WSCC.  The applicable price during reserve deficiency periods is the proxy price outlined above.  During times when no reserve deficiency exists, the mitigated price will be 85% of the highest price calculated in the last Stage 1 emergency.  This price will be in effect until the next Stage 1 emergency.  Sellers can bid higher than the proxy, with justification, during periods of reserve deficiency or when no reserve deficiency exists; PROVIDED THAT MARKETERS MAY NOT BID ABOVE THE PROXY PRICE.  FERC will consider the entire portfolio of a seller who seeks to justify a higher price than the proxy.  Generators may seek cost based rates for their entire portfolio in CA if they so choose (i.e. no cherry picking).

Demand Side Management- The plan originally set forth in the April 26 order is expected be removed in this order. 

ISO Reporting- ISO will need to report on a quarterly basis as to the status of building supply in CA. 

Comments- Comments will be sought on the issue of whether the price mitigation formula should be adjusted in response to expected varying load conditions due to seasonal changes.

Settlement Conference-  The settlement judge will convene a settlement conference on the refund issue no later than June 25 (next Monday) and the parties will have 15 days to settle.  A report from the judge to the Commission is due 7 days thereafter (for a total of 22 days).

Issues that are NOT expected to be addressed in the order include confidentiality, ISO board issues, ISO scheduling penalty application, and market based rate authorization.  The Order is not finally issued as of yet, and the status of the foregoing items could change upon issuance of a Final Order.  We will keep you posted.

This just came to me today.  This information is widely available to corporations and law enforcement around the country.  It will likely hit the media in the next day or so.  This is all the information that is available.

Enron Corp. Business Controls/Corporate Security received the following information via the National Threat Warning system.  While we do not wish to unduly alarm employees, the specificity of the information dictated immediate dissemination to our West Coast offices.  

THE FBI IS IN POSSESSION OF UNCORROBORATED INFORMATION INDICATING THE
POSSIBILITY OF ADDITIONAL TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES,
SPECIFICALLY THE WEST COAST.  REPORTEDLY, UNSPECIFIED GROUPS ARE
TARGETING SUSPENSION BRIDGES ON THE WEST COAST.  SIX INCIDENTS ARE TO
TAKE PLACE DURING RUSH HOUR BEGINNING FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 2 AND CONTINUING
THROUGH NOVEMBER 7, 2001.

NO FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS ALLEGED ATTACK IS KNOWN AT THIS TIME.
THE FBI IS ATTEMPTING TO VERIFY THE VALIDITY OF THIS REPORT.  RECIPIENTS
WILL BE UPDATED AS EVENTS WARRANT.

RECIPIENTS WHO RECEIVE OR DEVELOP INFORMATION RELATED TO THIS MATTER
SHOULD IMMEDIATELY CONTACT THEIR LOCAL FBI OFFICE.

We will keep you apprised if we receive any further information.

Thank you.

Heather,

I participate in this every year with my previous employer. Since moving from Eugene I now commute on the MAX. I would like to commute with my bike on MAX and perhaps the think to do is ride to the MAX and get off the train a few miles outside town and ride in. Do you know if the  Bicycle Transportation Alliance has coordinated with TriMet on this event?  

In any case, count me in. I'll be riding every day.

Jeff

Tim and Steve,
	As mentioned by Tim, another alternative would be to not make the prepetition payment and just use the market to settle these obligations.  If the cost of the payment is factored into the cost of the transmission and compared to the cost of a market settlement, the company would benefit by not making the prepetition payment for approximately the next 32 days worth of deliveries.  After this time the company would incur additional costs to deliver at Pinnacle Peak for the remaining term of the WALC obligation.  The term of the WALC agreement is through 12/31/04 and is in the money during LLH for the entire term.

Tim
We are currently using APS transmission to satisfy a LLH short position at Pinnacle Peak.  The revenue associated with the sale at Pinnacle Peak is $45/MWh.  The transmission is used to liquidate a long position at Four Corners 345 against the Pinnacle Peak short position.  The cost of the power purchased at Four Corners is $22.25/MWh.  Using the APS transmission is the most economic liquidation scheme at this time.  Our alternative would be to sell the length below the market value, and buy the short at above market value.  This assumes that we could find a willing buyer and seller. The spread between the purchase and sell price in this scenario is estimated at $5/mwh.  The cost of the APS transmission is $1.95/mwh.  

Salt River has the facility to provide the same service, but at this time they are unwilling to provide service to Enron.

If you have any further questions please contact me.

Chip,

I have a new critical vendor with a prepetition invoice.  Arizona Public Service provides us critical transmission between the major trading points in the Southwest.  We owe them $43,708.60 for November transmission charges.  They will cut us if we do not pay.  I have explained that this payment needs to go through the creditor's cash approval process.

They can cut us starting tomorrow, but have agreed to a stay if we pay our December invoice of $8,071.20.  I will be faxing this invoice for immediate payment.

Steve

Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Som=
e of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personne=
l) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, =
there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all th=
e steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our faciliti=
es and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi=
ty, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business con=
trols organization.  You can contact this organization through their websit=
e (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email =
(CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John B=
rindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Pleas=
e feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, =
or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for t=
he Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be ins=
tituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?=09As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron =
Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?=09Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid =
picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S=
. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identif=
ication).=20

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing=
 in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca=
rd.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. o=
r foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identifica=
tion) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?=09Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b=
adged contractor at all times.

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo=
yee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby receptio=
n area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointm=
ent.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to=
 the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected=
, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the =
escorting employee or badged contractor.

?=09Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their =
workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Secu=
rity (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y=
ou or hold doors open, allowing "tail gating" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit=
uted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times=
 in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi=
pment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand the=
se measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. =09


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommenda=
tions:

?=09While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommend=
s that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to str=
ongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pak=
istan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Geo=
rgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that =
planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Ara=
bia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?=09For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate securit=
y recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent =
reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being question=
ed and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a re=
sult, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the Uni=
ted States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry th=
eir passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest=
 that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card=
 as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immi=
gration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National=
ity Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her "regi=
stration" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanen=
t Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Cros=
sing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not his=
torically been asking domestic travelers for "registration" documentation, =
but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it=
 would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c=
urrent lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corpor=
ate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Doesn't look like too much change - but this weather pattern is so conducive to precipitation in and West of the Cascades in the Northwest and British Columbia that I needed to up precipitation amounts there. Calfiornia should remain mostly dry and and most of the time mild to warm. Overall no split flow regime seen on the models through 15 days which will benefit western Canada and the northern 2/3 of the watershed areas for a little while until things change again.

John,

As far as supplying ENA, there are opportunities to do deals immediately:  ENA continues to supply all of its in-the-money contracts by purchasing energy from counterparties on a pre-pay basis.  The contract is under the WSPP.  Call Mallory (3811) to sell in California, Crandall (3815) or Scholtes (3807) for NW, and Salisbury (3910) for SW.  If you have any legal questions, call Dale Rasmussen (8863).

Best, 

Steve

  FERC is holding a week-long conference on Regional Transmission Organizations in Washington  DC.  The conferences will generally be broadcast from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. PDT.  A copy of the conference agenda and broadcast sound to the conference will be near my desk (behind Tim Belden).  The picture will be on the far-right big screen.

Thanks to Dave Steiner for setting this up.

All:

For those people wanting to learn more about Var calculation and application, I've put a copy of JP Morgan's RiskMetrics documentation on the P: drive under \MidMarketing\RiskMetrics. Of the five documents, Part 2 probably gets most directly at the questions that were being asked in Matt's seminar.

Please be aware that there is an email circulating the Enron messaging environment !!!

The infected email has the following characteristics :
Subject :	Hi
Body :		Hi, I found a cool site! <web link> It's really cool!

An alternative version of the infected email also have an Excel spreadsheet attachment.

If you receive this email, DELETE it immediately. DO NOT CLICK ON THE WEB LINK. DO NOT LAUNCH THE EXCEL ATTACHMENT!

Please note that opening the email automatically via the "preview pane" does NOT launch the virus.

The Enron global messaging service has taken the necessary steps to ensure all internet email sent to your Enron internet address is virus free. But there are ways that you can ensure viruses do not make their way into our environment  :

Always ensure you do not launch attachments or web links received from people you do not know. 

Always ensure that you do not access/launch/download any attachments from external (web-based) email service providers while you are using the Enron network.

Detection + Prevention = Protection!

Thank you.

Bill; Mike Cashell (MPC's Transmission Mgr.) just phoned me concerned, beca=
use MPC's Real-Time group requested EPMI purchase energy for them under our=
 existing Energy Imbalance structure, and was notified by our Real-Time gro=
up that due to the newly implemented FERC price cap, we were have difficult=
y securing any resources.  Just to clarify things, we are settling MPC's Ch=
oice customers Energy Imbalance position, and PP&L Montana has the right to=
 any length resulting from MPC's "domestic" load Energy Imbalance.  In othe=
r words MPC is settling two separate Energy Imbalance accounts, so during t=
he hour they may be turning energy back to PP&L Montana, while at the same =
time finding themselves short for the Choice loads.  During the recent bull=
ish pricing conditions, Choice customer were leaving themselves long, as of=
 late, MPC is experiencing the Choice customers doing the opposite, positio=
ning themselves short.  The net result is that MPC will most likely be expe=
cting us to fill a short position from this point on, so I'd really like to=
 see what we can do to honor their requests, mindful of the favorable posit=
ion we've enjoyed over the last several months. Let me know if you'd like t=
o discuss this further, or better yet if you've got a workable solution to =
the problem.  In the meantime, thanks again to you and your staff for the o=
utstanding performance thus far in dealing with MPC.   John

Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.

SACRAMENTO - The Governor's Office of Emergency Services dispatched
on an 'immediate need', four additional strike teams; totaling 20
local government engines, to the Emigrant Gap fire off Interstate 80.

 The fire is currently burning out of control, threatening structures

and has the potential of jumping 
I - 80.  

Of the four teams, two originate from Sacramento County, one from
Placer County, and one from Calaveras County

Throughout Northern California and Nevada, eight fires have burned an

estimated 92,000 acres so far.	In addition to the recent group of
four strike teams, OES has also deployed 79 other State OES and local

government fire engines, two state-of-the-art OES satellite
communication trailers, and numerous fire and telecommunications
staff to the Northern California fire lines.  

The local and state-owned equipment has been dispatched through
California's Fire and Rescue 
Mutual Aid System, administered by OES, to assist the California
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, U.S. Forest Service, and
local departments.  The system is designed to ensure that additional
resources are provided to local jurisdictions whenever their own
resources are committed or insufficient for a specific fire.

Among the 99 engines deployed, 20 are State-owned OES Engines.	These

engines have been provided to local departments by OES.  Under an
agreement with the state, when requested by OES, fire departments are

required to dispatch the engines, including personnel, within an hour

to the scene of an emergency or disaster in California.

When not in use during a disaster, local departments may use the
engines for mutual aid response for neighboring cities and counties,
local multiple alarm fires, temporary replacement of out-of-service
engines, for training, and for other local needs.

If you have not yet volunteered, we still need people and would really appreciate your help.  Below is some information about the project we will be working on.  I will send more details to the definite volunteers.  

If we can't have your time, we would still like to borrow your tools.  Also, we are collecting food and baked goods to take to this man, who's only food is from Meals on Wheels (healthy stuff).

I look forward to your responses letting me know how you'll be able to help.  If you have questions, please call me at 3-0322.

Below is information about the house you will be volunteering at on Wednesday, August 8th.  Please send me a list of all the AA volunteers, as well as the ones who will be staying all day.

This house is in need of outside repairs.  Mr. Elvin Rayes is an older man and lives there alone.  He is a veteran and is very proud and doesn't want to accept charity.  However, he is going to let us help him with the outside.  He was very nice when I met him on Sunday and I told him that all the people coming over to help were excited they didn't have to go to work for the day.  This made it seem like we were doing more of a favor for ourselves versus for him.  He liked that.  This house really needs a lot of TLC

I would suggest everyone wear old clothes they don't mind painting in and their GREEN United Way t-shirts (shorts are fine but jeans may be better for those who want to mow - this is Houston and it's summer).  Below is a safety note one site leader sent out to his team.  You may want to forward this to your AA volunteers.

Safety First!!!

Let's make sure we are all safe. We all want to go home just like we get there - no injuries!!
A few safety rules:

If you see someone working unsafe - either tell them, or tell me immediately (so I can tell them)!
Plan your work, and discuss it with your work crew.
Don't hurry, use common sense.
Use the right tool for the job
Be careful lifting, lift with your legs, not your back.  If item is heavy or bulky, get help! - Don't be macho.
Be sure to wear safety glass or goggles when appropriate (weed eating, power saws, grass mowing, etc).
Wear work gloves
Make sure ladders are secure, and either tied down or someone stabilizing the base.
Be aware of people around you and what they are doing.

Tasks

Here are the main tasks at the Ettrick house.  Once everyone gets out there, we can shift the work according to everyone's preference as long as the work gets done.  People may work on more than one task depending on progress, congestion, and what people would like to do.

Replace rotten outside trim boards
Replace garage door (rotten on bottom)
Trim trees with chainsaw - especially in the back yard
Replace soffit screening
Clean bathroom - 2 people
Yard work - trim hedges, mow and edge
Replace screen door
Caulk around the windows
Scrape old paint and paint outside
Replace window screens
Replace doorbell

Tools

Here is the list of tools.  Bring what you have and make sure to put your name on it with a permanent marker.  Please let me know if you are missing any tools and I will do my best to get them there.  It may be good for people that have tool boxes just to bring them if they can.  It always seems like there will be something they will need that isn't there.

The particulars of the transaction:

We are obligated to deliver 25 MW of power to WALC at Pinnacle Peak through 12/31/04.

The company receives $45 for each MW delivered to WALC.

Pinnacle Peak is not a liquid trading hub.  There are only two utilities with facilities at Pinnacle Peak, WALC and APS.  

We are currently utilizing APS transmission to deliver energy to WALC during off peak hours. 

The cost of the APS transmission is $1.95.

The energy to satisfy this obligation is available at Four Corners under contract from El Paso Electric.  The energy from El Paso is contracted to be purchased through the end of this year under a prepetition agreement at a fixed price of $22.25.

The Transmission Service Agreement will be terminated by APS for nonpayment of  a prepetition obligation of $43,708.60.

APS is the sole party able to provide transmission to Pinnacle Peak at this time.

Absent the ability to purchase transmission from APS, the company will be forced to settle the WALC obligation at above market prices due to the illiquidity at Pinnacle Peak.  These costs could run as high as $5.  

The inablity to purchase APS transmission for $1.95 will increase the company's costs by as much as $3 over the term of the WALC obligation.

There are approximately 95,000 MWh remaining to be delivered to WALC for the remainder of 2001 on light load hours.

The increased cost to deliver would result in an additional expense of $285,000 for the remaining deliveries this year.

The increased cost for the entire term of the WALC agreement could exceed $1,000,000.

FYI -

We will NOT be confirming hourly trades for generators or any other counterparties until further notice. The logistics of the process are still being worked out. In the meantime, keep checking "No Confirm" on all deals.

Bloomberg deals are another story. They do get confirmed everyday. However, the people in the Confirms group know this inherently and do not need the added validation of a "Yes Confirm" checkmark. What they do need is a clue as to which deals have been done with Bloomberg, and the best way to convey this is by typing "Bloomberg" next to the word "Broker" in your Deal Entry screen.

If this is unclear, please let me know. 

Thanks,
Kate

This sheet is as complete as possible, and I am worried about it due to the following circumstances;

1.  The Dispatch sheet that comes to Real time was 25 MW flat on Sunday and LLH on Monday more than all the preschedules that were tagged today.

2.  The Four Corners values on that dispatch sheet changed between 5:15 and 5:42, from 10 mw long to flat. I tried to resolve the four corners schedules with PSCO, who  
told me they did not have a purchase from EPE in July.  I tried calling numerous people at their office and cell phone numbers and got forwarded to Enron each time. Lisa had a buy resale with PNM at four corners, but that booked out and did not seem to match the 10 long that I saw in the dispatch sheet.  I spoke with Pete, who assured me that the sale to PSCO was good for the summer.  

3.  I still was unable to resolve the 25 mw difference between the tags and schedules that we knew, and what the dispatch sheet said we should have for preschedule.  No EPE representative was available to tell me what they were expecting for the schedules, and I was referred by a Dispatch person to call on Saturday and speak to Carlos when he came in at 4 pm.  I was very uncomfortable doing this, and so in my desperation called Roger at home, who after some discussion with Steve at his home confirmed that the extrat 25 flat Sunday and LLH Monday was a deal that is supposed to begin on July 3.  I trust his assesment, and have removed the extra schedule from the sheet.



Between all of the preschedulers today at Enron, we have spent over 6 hours dealing with the EPE schedules today.  

The sheet is as complete as I possibly can find justification for.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Freight Markets 
Enron Freight Markets signed four capacity contracts with three new counterparties to finish the third quarter.  Three of the capacity deals were for options that will allow EFM to take up to 49 million truck miles along 11 different shipping lanes through 2003.  The contracts will be used to meet current customer needs, as well as to expand the foundation of products offered by the mid-marketing and trading groups.


IN THE NEWS 
The Fittest 50: Winner Profile 
Power the Web: Using a small energy trade site as a springboard, Enron transformed itself into a master of e-markets. 
Darwin Magazine BY DAINTRY DUFFY
http://www.darwinmag.com/read/100101/power.html <http://www.darwinmag.com/read/100101/power.html>

Enron launched its online energy marketplace in November 1999. Still, many longtime customers were wary of the change. "I had one guy that I was talking to for three to four months, and I couldn't get him to trade online," recalls Larry Gagliardi, director of marketing for the crude oil and refined products business. "Finally, I talked him through it: 'Put the little arrow on the sale price, click and you're done,'" Gagliardi says. "The next day he did five trades with us. The next week he did 20. The following week he did 40 in one day, and I had to call him and tell him to slow down."

An extreme case of love at first site? Perhaps. But the simplicity-and the lack of red tape and paperwork-of EnronOnline has rocketed the company to success.

Since launching the site, Fittest 50 winner Enron has not only revolutionized the energy markets but pioneered the Web as a supremely easy place to buy and sell commodities. EnronOnline now encompasses 30 commodity markets, from forest products and plastics to broadband and weather futures, and currently averages a whopping $3 billion in transactions per day. "EnronOnline is one of the leading examples of the right way to apply technology," says Bruce D. Temkin, group director at Cambridge, Mass.-based Forrester Research. "While other dotcoms tried to invent new business models, or made them up, Enron has done a great job of [using technology to] extend its business model."

I've entered the following deals per the lending agreement with El Paso. We'll be short 50 mw at Palo tomorrow, and this energy will need to be procured in the hour-ahead market. Please adjust our purchase from El Paso (699933) to a price of $4 after purchasing energy elsewhere, or to the appropriate price plus $4 if you purchase from El Paso. Thank you for your careful attention to this process.....

699933 - STWBOM buys EPE
	 PV/HLH
	 25 MW @ $60

699942 - STWBOM sells STSW
	 PV/HLH
	 25 MW @ $60

699944 - STSW buys EPE
	 PV/HLH
	 25 MW @ $60

If you have questions, ask me, and I'll give you answers.

Thanks,
Kate

Group,

We are short 50 mws for tomorrow at PV through lending with EPE.  25 mws will be under ST-SW, 25 mws will be under ST-WBOM.

We are also short 65 mws for tomorrow at SP-15.  25 mws will be under ST-WBOM, 40 mws will be under ST-CALI.

Both schedules are HE 7-22.  All deals should be under appropriate books.  Please take extra time with the EPE lending.  We would like to do this size throughout August and want to make sure they have no problems.  Details regarding prices and deal numbers will be coming from Kate.

Thanks,
Bill

We currently have an opening(s) in the Utility Risk Management (URM) group reporting to Steve Swain.  Based upon the candidate skill level, the opening(s) will be at the Specialist, Sr. Specialist or Analyst level.

Responsibilities will include:
Building and maintaining forward price curves for a number of utility tariff rates across the WSCC.
Tracking and analyzing URM's portfolio of retail positions.
Preparing daily reports for management that analyze various factors contributing to changes in positions, P/L, hedges, etc.
Performing research and analysis on legislative and regulatory changes that could impact our price cuves and/or positions.
Working closely with the Retail Gen desk to coordinate activities involved in managing EWS's overall retail position.
Research to support the development of effective hedging strategies for the various risk exposures inherent to the URM book.

The ideal candidate(s) will possess sound Excel modeling skills (including at least superficial knowledge of Visual Basic), some familiarity with database systems and/or experience collecting and analyzing large amounts of data, excellent organizational skills, and a solid understanding of financial statements.  While some experience with regulated tariffs and utility cost of service modeling would be helpful, it is not necessary.

If you are interested in this opportunity, please let Julie Kearney know by close of business on Friday 10/5.

Holden,

Do you ever call in NPC (t) with out a reservation.  NPC has two blocks of 400 mw's for the 27th and 28th and I don't know who did it and it is not in Enpower.  It looks like it could have been preschedule with the shape of it.  There isn't anything in the real time sheet.

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Good Morning.
 
WTC voicemail is down.  The link between WTC and Qwest is not working.   PGE has reported the problem at 5:50am and we are waiting to hear what's happening.    
 
Quick reminder on what can occur when voicemail goes down and what your might experience when the link comes back up:
 
1) The message waiting light won't go off after you retrieve your messages. If this occurs just have the person lift the handset, hear dial tone and dial,  113. This will clear the message waiting light.
 
2) The message waiting light is not on and you could have a message.    Have employees check their mailbox just in case they are expecting critical messages.  The next voicemail will activate the message waiting light.   
 
Please let me know if you have questions or concerns.

Please note that there is a new deal entered today to transfer the BOM portion of the UAMPS deal from LT-SW to ST-WR per Matt's request. The deal details are:

Index-Option: 807382.1
Term: 10/8/01 - 10/31/01
(we use the same method to pick the hours as we use for the CSU option)
The MTM value calculated from this deal for ST-WR is $30,685.

For Monday strip:
Index-Forward: 807382.2
Term: 10/8/01 - 10/8/01
HE 11 - 10mws
HE 12-14  -  25mws
per Holden.

The BOM strips for the index-option deal #804470 in LT-SW have been zeroed out.

An annuity deal #807428 was entered for the difference between $2.5 MM (per Matt) and $30,685 = $2,469,315, for LT-SW Buy from ST-WR.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Samantha

Holden, thanks for accepting our invitation to the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta!  You'll have a great time. 

As promised, I am enclosing additional information on making your trip here October 7-9, 2001.  I will also be needing some information from you.

1.  Please email me, call me or fill out the attached form and fax it back to me with your travel information as soon as you know it, so we can arrange times to meet you at the airport. 

2.  In October, Albuquerque can be very cool.  Please bring a light jacket and/or sweater, and some warm clothes, as many of the events we will be hosting are outside.

3.  You will be lodging in a Class a RV on site at the Balloon Fiesta, with one of our other guests.  There will be 3 RV's that we have secured for our guests (6 guests in all), and these RV's will be parked in our own reserved area of the Balloon Fiesta.  This way, there will be no "early rising" to attend balloon events, as some of the start times for ascension events are 5:45AM - 7:00 AM!  And you will be in midst of all of the excitement.  These RV's are top of the line: roomy, comfortable, and well-stocked with all the necessities (snacks, drinks, toiletries, sheets, blankets, towels).

4.  All meals will be hosted by us, either at local restaurants or they will be professionally catered to our area. 

We will also host an outing to Santa Fe; sightseeing and museums, or you can play golf instead (please indicate in your reply if you will be renting clubs or bringing your own).    We would also like to treat you to a balloon ride (weather permitting) if you are so inclined.  Just please note it on the attached sheet.

And last but not least, we would like you to provide us with your sweatshirt size so we can send you home with an official Balloon Fiesta sweatshirt.

I have attached to this email a form that you can either fill out and fax back to me or use it as a guide to answer all the questions that I am requesting through email.  Of course, you can still call me at 505/855-6202.  If you plan to fax this information to me, the number is 505/855-6240.

<<RSVP Form.doc>> 

All of us at PNM's Wholesale Power Marketing are thrilled that you are coming!  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.

Regards, 


Sandy Stephens 
Assistant to Duane Farmer

Steve & Christian,

After talking with the Southwest desk here is what is happening with Azusa.

 Deal #831407.1 Paloverde Heavy Load 10mw Purchase from Azusa at $32.50  1/1/02 thru 3/31/02
 Deal #537901.1 Paloverde Heavy Load 10mw Sale to Azusa at $139.00         1/1/02 thru 12/31/02

	These two deals are the only ones active for January  and are being performed on.  They are booked out financially. All other deals I found are for Q3 '02 and beyond.  

I hope this clarifies some things.

As most of you know, American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston to Los Angeles was hijacked yesterday and then crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York.  We are very sorry to report that we believe an Enron employee was on board that flight.   Nick Humber, a director in Enron Wind's commercial origination group, was listed on the flight's manifest, and although his family has not received official confirmation that he boarded the flight, they have been unable to contact him.  Nick was based in Boston and was traveling to Los Angeles for a meeting.  We have talked with Nick's family and offered our full support.  Please continue to keep Nick's family and everyone affected by this horrific event in your thoughts and prayers.

This information was sent by Tim Belden and Chris Calger earlier in the year. I am sending it again for the benefit of our new hires and as a reminder to be responsible while enjoying this evening's event.

============

Over the last couple of years we have had numerous social events including holiday parties, post-quarterly meeting outings, and going away parties. While I hope that people thoroughly enjoy themselves, I ask that you keep in mind that we all have to act professionally and responsibly during and after these events. I have been working with Chris Calger and Amy FitzPatrick to put together some guidelines for company-sponsored social events:

The company will provide soft drinks, beer and wine. You may choose to order other beverages at your expense.
Functions will run for a specified period of time. If there is an open bar, we will establish a time certain after which Enron will not pay for any additional drinks.
If you require assistance getting home, please contact a taxi and submit the fare for expense reimbursement with no questions asked. The last thing in the world we want is to have people break the law or put their safety and the safety of others in jeopardy.

============

PLEASE NOTE: We now have cab vouchers available for our company events. Please check with your admin assistant to obtain a voucher, or see me at the event--no questions asked.

Thanks,
Grace

We understand that the recent cases of Anthrax contamination and the possibility that biological agents such as Anthrax may be used in a terrorist attack are raising great concerns among Enron employees.  Many government and commercial facilities in the United States have already received Anthrax threat letters containing powdery substances.  Most of these have, however, been determined to be false alarms.  We have no reason to believe that Enron has been or will be the target of an Anthrax attack, but we want to provide all employees with background information on Anthrax and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

If you have additional questions or concerns, please contact Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.

The most important thing to remember is:  Do not panic.  To infect someone, the Anthrax organism must be rubbed into abraded skin, swallowed, or inhaled as a fine, aerosolized mist.  Infection can be prevented after exposure to Anthrax by early treatment with the appropriate antibiotics.  Anthrax cannot be spread from one person to another.

Following are guidelines for identifying and dealing with suspicious letters or packages:

What constitutes a suspicious letter or parcel?  (Remember, these are only guidelines.  Use your best judgment when determining if a letter or package is suspicious.)

--  It is marked with the word "Anthrax."
--  It has a non-identifiable powdery substance on the outside.
--  It is unexpected or from someone unfamiliar to you.
--  Is addressed to someone no longer with your organization or is otherwise outdated.
--  Has no return address, or has one that cannot be verified as legitimate.
--  Is of unusual weight, given its size, or is lopsided or oddly shaped.
--  Has an unusual amount of tape on it.
--  Is marked with restrictive endorsements such as "personal" or "confidential".
--  Has a strange odor or stain.
--  Shows a city or country in the postmark that does not match the return address.

What do I do if I receive such a letter or package that I believe contains Anthrax?
--  Do not shake or empty the contents of any suspicious envelope or package.
--  Place the envelope or package in a plastic bag or some other type of container to prevent leakage of contents.
--  If you do not have any container, then cover the envelope or package with anything (e.g., clothing, paper, trash can, etc.) and do not remove this cover.
--  Leave the room and close the door, or section off the area to prevent others from entering (i.e., keep others away). 
-- Wash your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder to your face.
--  Notify your local building security official or an available supervisor.  Have them call 911 to alert the local police authorities.
--  List all people who were in the room or area when this suspicious letter or package was recognized. Give this list to both the local public health authorities and law enforcement officials for follow-up investigations and advice.  
If you open an envelope or package and a suspicious powder spills out:
--  Do not try to clean up the powder.  Cover the spilled contents immediately with anything (e.g., clothing, paper, trash can, etc.) and do not remove this cover! 
--  Leave the room and close the door, or section off the area to prevent others from entering (i.e., keep others away).
--  Wash your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder to your face.  Report the incident to your local building security official or an available supervisor.  Have them call 911 to alert the local police authorities. 
--  Remove heavily contaminated clothing as soon as possible and place in a plastic bag, or some other container that can be sealed.  This clothing bag should be given to the emergency responders for proper handling. 
--  Shower with soap and water as soon as possible.  Do not use bleach or other disinfectant on your skin. 
--  If possible, list all people who were in the room or area, especially those who had actual contact with the powder. Give this list to both the local public health authorities so that proper instructions can be given for medical follow-up, and to law enforcement officials for further investigation.

Casey when you moved the CSU deal # 573463 from the Exotic Book (13982) to Enpower - where did you receive the strike prices?


The STSW desk looks at the contract for the Strike price, which has the following:

10/1/00-9/30/01 = 28.082
10/1/01-9/30/02 = 28.9245
10/1/02-9/30/03 = 29.7922

Deal Entry has

10/1/00-9/30/01 = 27.832
10/1/01-9/30/02 = 30.0345
10/1/02-9/30/03 = 31.2522



Do you happen to remember where these prices had come from?

After slugging it out with the ISO last week I think we understand the protocols for communicating with them re: unit outages.  We need to communicate with 2 different groups:  the Generation Outage Desk and the Real Time Desk.  First, we fill out an outage report and send it to the Generation Outage Desk.  When the outage is over or the period of the outage changes, we are required to telephone the Real Time Outage Desk.  That phone number is 916/351-2488.  When the calls come in to Real Time from the ISO asking about the outages, they are following up on reports we have filed to see if our outage is ending as planned.

The Services Desk will be responsible for communicating with both the Generation Outage Desk and the Real Time Outage Desk, but Real Time should try to be aware of all outages and be able to communicate with the ISO when they call.  Services will communicate outages to Real Time.

Thanks

Chris

Amy-
I show DMS #'s 10444 and 10445.
I'll enter these in the system today, although we do not agree with the loss charge from DMS 10444.  I have been disputing this directly with their transmission department.  We will pay the bill as is so as not to incur any late charges but there is a great possibility that we will need to future-adjust for a $500 credit from them as we are not in agreement with the $ 6120.

Thanks,

 Virginia

Holden, Mark, and Tom-  FYI - I called Don again and he is "out" til Thursday.  I was given the name of John Montoya to contact.  Do you know who he is?

Guys,
 
  I need a copy of your PMA's for May, June, and July (or whatever document you have from Risk) that is showing improper debits and credits to your book.  I have an appointment with Risk at 2 pm and I will try to get this all sorted out today, but I need to know exactly what you're seeing.

Sean asked me to look into the timing of price cap decisions.  Here's what it looks like:

November 7th		Commission meets but highly unlikely that they adress NW price cap
November 9th		Written comments due to FERC
November 13th ish	FERC posts agenda for November 20th meeting
November 20th		FERC likely issues order on NW caps

Tim, the issue is not on the agenda for the Commission's meeting on November 7.  This is no surprise, however, since written comments are still pending and not due until November 9 (Alan is preparing ours with my back-up).  Pat Wood said at the last Commission meeting that he doesn't wish to issue significant orders between meetings, so it is unlikely that FERC will act before its next scheduled meeting.  There is time pressure because winter is advancing.  Therefore our educated guess is that the order would issue at the next meeting following submittal of the comments, to be held on November 20.  The meeting agenda for this meeting will be available on the 13th or 14th; as soon as it issues we will let you know if it appears on the agenda.  In the meantime, if we hear anything more definitive we will let you know right away.  Ray

When is FERC going to rule on this?

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Subject:	USW/Luscar strike update

A memorandum of agreement has been reached between the USW and Luscar.  A
ratification vote is likely to occur over the weekend although the USW are
in control of that aspect and they face logistical challenges  in
conducting the vote.  If the vote were to occur, and if the it resulted in
ratification it is anticipated workers would be on the job by Tuesday with
it taking several more days to restore normal operations.

I will provide another update if I receive word of the outcome of the vote
before Monday (which I may not as, again it is the USW that are in control
of this).

Regards,
Jim

?	Customers will not be allowed to transact with themselves on physical transactions. If a top of stack limit order has been placed on a physical product the counterparty or desk that placed the order will not be allowed to transact on it.
?	If a customer or desk has top of stack limit orders at different prices on both the bid and offer and subsequently moves the price of one so that they are at the same price, both orders will be cancelled. The customer would have effectively transacted with himself.

Please call me if you have any questions. Thanks.

Concur Expense (XMS)
Common Questions


1.  Where can I find online documentation on Concur Expense?
Answer: Documentation on Concur Expense is stored in the ISC Document Library.   Go to the following link:
http://isc.enron.com/site/doclibrary/user/default.asp  and click on the XMS - Concur Expense folder on the left.

2. How can I sign up for Concur Expense training and how much does it cost?
Answer: Go to the following link: http://iscedcenter.enron.com/docentlm/login.htm.  Log in using your Enron email address.  Enter your birth date as the password in the following format: MMDDYYYY.  Under the Courses section, select Concur Expense (XMS).  This will show the training schedule.  Click the Enroll button to sign up for a class.  The cost is $250.

3. Will old XMS expense reports be converted to the new Concur Expense system?
Answer: No.  History data was not converted to the new system because of our move to an Application Service Provider (ASP) solution for Concur Expense.

4. How can I view my old expense reports?
Answer: Call the ISC Customer Care group at 713-345-4727.  The ISC will be responsible for printing out old expense reports and forwarding them to you.  Other options are being reviewed to allow you to view old expense reports.

5. Are there any Enron specific help instructions for Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes.  If you log into Concur Expense, you will see a link to Enron Help on the Concur Expense home page under the Company Links section.  Also you will see a button for Enron Help at the top of the screen when entering expense reports.

6. Is Enron's Travel Policy available in Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes. If you log into Concur Expense, you will see a link to Travel Policy on the Concur Expense home page under the Company Links section.  Also you will see a button for Travel Policy at the very top of the screen when entering expense reports

7. What if I am unable to see any of my credit card charges in Concur Expense?
Answer: Since there are a number of factors that could cause this problem, it is best to call the ISC Customer Care group first.  The ISC will research the problem and get back to you with an answer.

8. Does Concur Expense have a time-out feature?
Answer: Yes.  Concur Expense will automatically time out after 20 minutes of inactivity.

9. How do I enter foreign currency into Concur Expense?
Answer: Go to the ISC Document Library described in #1 above.  Go to the XMS - Concur Expense folder.  Next go to the Special Procedures folder and following the directions stated in the document called Add a Foreign Currency Expense to an Expense Report.

10. Are there any other sources to quickly get me started using Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes.  Concur Expense provides a Quick Tour for new users.  Log into Concur Expense and click the Help button in the top right corner of the screen.  Then click the button labeled Quick Tour at the top of the help screen.  The ISC intranet home page also contains some helpful information.  The following link summarizes some of the topics discussed above:  http://isc.dev.corp.enron.com/site/XMSchange.htm.

11. Can you quickly describe some of the internal changes in the new Concur Expense system?
Answer:  There are minimal changes in the new upgrade.  Here is a list:
?	The first screen only has one tab instead of two
?	New expense types were added
?	Attendees and approvers will now be printed on the expense reports
?	Manager and receipt dunning notices will be sent out
?	The statistical order and statistical WBS element fields have been separated out


Please direct all other questions to the ISC Customer Care group at 713-345-4727.

Subject:        Request for Proposals - PacifiCorp Eastern Control Area 



The regulated merchant arm of PacifiCorp is requesting proposals from entities who are capable of supplying electric resources delivered to PacifiCorp's Eastern electrical control area.  Responses to this Request for Proposals ("RFP") are due prior to 2:00 p.m. Pacific prevailing time on October 19, 2001.  Both supply-side and demand-side resources capable of being scheduled for delivery on a day-ahead and/or hour-ahead basis are welcome to bid and those resources capable of accepting schedule changes during the day and/or hour of delivery will be ascribed the highest value.  Resources not capable of being scheduled for delivery in advance are welcome to bid under this RFP, however, they will not be valued the same as resources capable of meeting their pre-scheduled amount with a high level of consistency. In addition, resources that are capable of providing either the spinning or non-spinning component of operating reserves are also encouraged to bid under this RFP. 

Please review the RFP carefully.  Your proposal will be considered separate from any existing wholesale purchase, electric service or DSM agreements you currently have in place with PacifiCorp. Entities bidding must have either FERC status for resource delivery or be capable of delivering resources under existing regulated restrictions and appropriate retail tariffs.  PacifiCorp intends to pursue definitive agreements with entities that provide PacifiCorp with the best combination of resource characteristics and evaluated resource costs, including credit risk factors.

The RFP provides a contact number for questions and shows a schedule for submittal.  Please note that a Notice of Intent to Propose form must be returned by October 1st in order to bid. There will be a pre-bid conference scheduled in early October.  We look forward to your interest and proposals.  If you still have additional questions, do not hesitate to contact Lisa Lynch, Project Management Office at (503) 813-5669.

Holden this is not in Production yet.
I will keep you updated when everything is ready to use the Index Option deal type as well
as the Option Exercise function to exercise the option.

       Option Exercise ver 3.0.0.24 is in P:\Powersys\stage.

       It should exercise Index Options to Index-Forward deals and it writes "HOUR"
       in term_strip_expiry_freq_cd in pwr_term_strip_rules table, so Portcalc
       can make difference between such an Index-Forward deal (from exercising an option)
       and an ordinary one.

Subject:	 Index Option

We have the approval from the business unit (Matt Motley) to implement Index Option deal type as such:

Index Option will be a physical option with a strike @ an Index.
For a BDay option expiry the analysis will work as follows:

The forward position will be valued taking the deal strip hours, these hours
will be valued against the scalars - the hours in the money compared
to the forward underlying price will be estimated as exercised. Only the hours
in the money will be evaluated.  For the day of exercise the hours evaluated will
be the hours exercised in scheduling. 

Daily the Option Exercise function in Enpower will create an Index Forward Leg
from the Index Option (expiry will be daily but the price will be hourly) @ a strike of the specified Index.

Liquidation:
Liquidation for the next day will be calculated using the actual exercised strip against the curve as the mid price.
The True-up will be index vs curve when the index is published.


This is how we would analyze each hour.  
The sum of each hour will be the value of the option.

For each hour:
HE7 = 
Strike = Forward Price (since Index is not available)
Underlying = Forward Price * scalar
Vol = Daily Vol
Rate = Libor
Time = same as daily (treated as a daily option for time)

Vo =f(u,s,v,r,t)
V = Intrinsic + Extrinsic

Subject:	Index Option

Matt I need written confirmation regarding the analysis of the new Deal Type "Index Option" for IT to implement.

Index Option will be a physical option with a strike @ an Index.
For a BDay option expiry the analysis will work as follows:

The forward position will be valued taking the deal strip hours, these hours
will be valued against the scalars - the hours in the money compared
to the forward underlying price will be estimated as exercised. Only the hours
in the money will be evaluated.  For the day of exercise the hours evaluated will
be the hours exercised in scheduling. 

Buy Call: Estimated Exercised hour will have a price above the mid
Buy Put: Estimated Exercised hour will have a price below the mid

Daily the Option Exercise function in Enpower will create an Index Forward Leg
from the Index Option (expiry will be daily but the price will be hourly) @ a strike of the specified Index.

Liquidation:
Liquidation for the next day will be calculated using the actual exercised strip against the curve as the mid price.
The True-up will be index vs curve when the index is published.

Tomorrow night at 5:30 the Exchange Mail Server will be taken down for upgrading and standardization. From 5:30 to about 8:30 our mail system will be down.

I have had the two realtime traders working tomorrow night migrated to a Houston server so that they will continue to be able to send and receive email during the outage.

If anyone absolutely needs email during the outage, please let me know as soon as possible.

Matt - Zhiyun needs to make some code changes before I can move Craig to Palo in Enpower (she needs
to treat Craig as a separate region from Palo so the deal will value as a Basis Option).  Therefore I will not be changing this until she is ready.
I will keep you updated.

For the term of the UAMPS deal -  Rockies is marked flat to Palo - so I ran the Intrinsic & Extrinsic evaluation.
Once we change Craig to Palo in enpower and the correlation, we can revalue.

MTM = 1,243,586
Intrinsic = 712,104
Extrinsic = 531,483

Please make sure that all of your deals are correctly entered in Deal Entry as confirmation - "no."  There are quite a few coming over to our system as "yes" agreement.  This is a problem because it is very easy to mistakenly send a confimation letter to the counterparty on hourly trades -they always call confused when that happens.  Most of the time, I change these to no confirm, however, there are several everyday now and it really slows us down when volumes are high.  

Thanks so much for your help!

Subject:	Important - Position Manager Rollout

It is now time to roll out the new position manager into production.  By replacing our current excel based curve files and west tot position files we will dramatically increase the reliability of our risk systems.  For example, twice in the last week the Portland Risk Group and Houston's technology group had to work late into the night because of Access database problems.  By switching to the new Position Manager / Curve File tool, we will be able to eliminate those Access databases and increase the reliability of the Portcalc.

I have been using the new position manager for the last month and really like it.  It is really fast and flexible.  You can save a bunch of different profiles.  Information can be easily exported to excel.

On June 27th we will no longer be using the existing curve files and west tots.  We will only use the new position manager to submit data to our risk systems and receive data from our risk systems.  You can continue to use whatever file you want to build your curves, but the curves must be loaded into the new position manager and uploaded through the new position manager.  Normal Lee will be up here next week to help us during the transition period.  Starting today we should begin running in complete parallel.  Sometime next week we should cut over to the new position manager and if any issues come up Norman will be here to help.

I appreciate your help with this.  I know that it's a pain to switch, but I am confident that the new position manager, once we are comfortable with it, will be better for everyone.  Sanjay's development team has done a great job with this tool and is prepared to fully support us during this rollout.  Quality of life should improve for both the risk group and the technology team.  Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

As you should now be aware the preschedulers were unable to get all of their tags in by the tagging deadline on Friday.  Cara has left a color coded sheet of delayed tags that the real time group must implement between 4 hours  and 1 hour prior to the power flowing.  Please take a look at this sheet when coming in on shift.  Also, there are two tags that need special attention tomorrow (7/2) evening.  Tag numbers 25843 and 25870 have been printed out and attached to Cara's list.  These two tags were flowing through the CISO and needed to be checked out day ahead by PacifiCorp and the ISO.  Unfortunately the ISO and PAC needed real tags not delayed tags in order to allow PACs schedule to flow.  Therefore per my discussion with Dick Dowdy at PAC, he has created a tag showing the total of 35 MW coming out of his system (tag # 9152Y) in order to check out with the ISO.  
THE REAL TIME GROUP MUST DO THE FOLLOWING ON THE PAC TAGS: 1. send the delayed tags out prior to the times indicated on Cara's sheet but no sooner than 4 hrs prior to energy flow.  2.  On the pacificorp tags referenced above, please call PAC after sending the delayed tags and tell them to kill their tag number 9152Y.      3. Call the ISO to inform them of the tag change and give them the delayed tag numbers.  4.  call PSCO and inform them you have submitted the tags.  

Please make sure this is happens !    If this is not taken care of the schedule won't flow and  Enron will be charged liquidated damages by PacifiCorp.  If you have ANY questions regarding these tags or any other tags on Cara's list, do not hesitate to contact Cara, Bill, or myself on this matter.  


Cheers,  
GUZ

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

This is just to let everyone who is using the New Curve Manager in Enpower:
The Curve Manager is having a problem in Terminal Server 2. (NAHOU-TRDTS2) The problem is currently being diagnosed by both the Enpower Team and Terminal Server Team in Houston. As Soon as it is fixed, I will let everyone know. For now you can use any other terminal server session (i.e. TRDTS1, or TRDTS03 - TRDTS5) for running the Curve Manager.

I am pleased to announce that the Enron Board has elected Paula Rieker as corporate secretary, effective immediately.  She will replace Rebecca Carter, who has served in that role since 1999.  Paula will have dual reporting responsibility to me and to Jim Derrick, executive vice president and general counsel.

Paula joined Enron in 1990 and has experience in a variety of functions, including assistant treasurer for Enron Corp., vice president and chief financial officer of Enron Global Power & Pipelines, and vice president of Financial Initiatives in Accounting.  Most recently, she has been managing director of Investor Relations, where she has worked for the past four years.  Paula will continue in a dual role with IR through mid-October.  Paula has a bachelor's degree in finance from Texas A&M University, and she is a Certified Public Accountant.

Rebecca has been with the company for 11 years and served in a variety of capacities.  I want to thank Rebecca for her many years of service to Enron.  I am sorry she has decided to leave, but am grateful she will stay on through the end of January to ensure a smooth transition of her duties.  

Please join me in congratulating Paula on her new responsibilities and in wishing Rebecca well in her future endeavors.

There is a 25 mw light load schedule that Aquila Canada is generating and AVA sinks at there system.   The schedule is going real-time because Aquila reported the transmission incorrectly to BPA transmission group.  We bought from Aquila Deal # 508908.1 and sold to WWP Deal # 162508.1.  Please refer to Aquila tag numbers #167799 and #167797.  Be sure to call everyone in the path to check out.

We just experienced an outage of around 7 servers for 1.5 minutes.
 
Cause:
 
One of our master network switches crashed and rebooted itself making the device attached to them unavailable.
 
The Servers themselves did not crash, just there connection to the network.
 
The Network Team is looking into why this happened.

The following message is from the World Trade Center Leasing office.  Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

This is to advise you that the World Trade Center is presently having water testing done by the City of Portland. These tests are causing mineral sediments to come through the pipes. There is no cause for alarm, and thank you for all the calls. The water is not pleasant to look at, yet it is drinkable, the tests show the water to be very safe. Hopefully by Tuesday morning, if not earlier, the water should be back to normal. For those of you who wish to have clear water to drink, please feel free to come to suite #250 where we have filtered water available. 	
This is something that is done once a year and is out of our control. Thank you for being patient.

Holden & Lisa -

Per Holden, I've changed deal 630176 from a price of $170 to $197. Terms and reasons are as follows:

	6/4/01
	STSW buys EPE
	49 mw/HLH
	
The other side of this deal is a sale to El Paso for $204. Kathy questioned the invoice she received from Houston this month, because the breakdown of transmission costs and fees we had given her (regarding buy-resales done by your desk on 6/1, 6/2, and 6/4) amounted to a spread of $14.06. The deals we entered into our system, and subsequently billed El Paso for, amounted to spreads of $14.06 for 6/1, 	$11.06 for 6/2, and $34 for 6/4. To remedy this, and extend a gesture of apology for the mistake, we've changed our buy from El Paso on 	the 4th to a price of $197, leaving a spread of $7 to cover our transmission costs. 

I've explained this to Kathy at El Paso and Amy in Settlements, and wanted to give both of you a record of the change as well. Please let 	me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets
Washington, DC -- The Society of the Plastics Industry Inc. (SPI), the trade association representing one of the largest manufacturing industries in the United States, announced that it has entered into a strategic alliance with Enron Global Markets LLC (EGM), to jointly promote price risk management financial products that will help plastics processors in managing financial risks associated with resin price volatility.

Through this agreement, SPI members will have direct access to EGM's experience in the plastics industry and to the financial products the company currently offers to the market. In addition, SPI and EGM will offer special seminars uniquely tailored to the needs of the SPI membership on effectively managing price risk. As part of Enron's partnership with SPI, we will conduct a series of industry-specific risk management seminars.  

Companies in the plastics industry today face a number of challenges such as rising costs in raw material and energy, and economic factors beyond their control including slow demand.  Financial products being offered by EGM can, for example, fix or establish a maximum resin price for a given period of time, thereby allowing the companies to make better business decisions and improve financial stability.

EGM Crude and Products Fundamentals
The EGM Crude and Products Fundamentals team is proud to announce the launch of its new "Morning Briefing" report.  The report is aimed at providing traders, mid marketers and originators with a detailed yet concise overview of factors impacting the oil and products markets in the previous 24 hours and how these factors are likely to affect the market in the coming day.  In addition to market moving news items, the report contains key market data such as prices, MMBtu curves, refinery outages, open interest analysis and various other market driving information.  The report is updated by 7.30 a.m. each day and can be found on the Crude and Products Fundamentals intranet at <http://egmfundy.corp.enron.com/crude/> under In House Analysis, Morning Briefing.

Such activity includes change in credit rating, bankruptcy filings, high risk shut-off notices, health and safety concerns, possible litigation, etc. File the relevant information by either phone or e-mail and note it as an URGENT ISSUE to enable the Business Center to act immediately.  

EWS Business Analysis and Reporting
Enron Wholesale Services (excluding Net Works) has nearly 1350 invoices totaling almost $12 million waiting for coding and approval in the iPayit system.  Over 900 invoices have been in the system greater than 30 days.  Although a company-wide task force is working to improve the entire process, each of us needs to do our part to ensure accurate and timely payment to our vendors. 

Following are the statistics on invoices in the system greater than 30 days:

ENA	443 invoices totaling $4.3 million
EBS	358 invoices totaling $4.6 million
EGM	 87 invoices totaling $262,000
EIM	 33 invoices totaling $123,000 

If you purchase items that generate invoices (including cell phones, pagers, etc.), or if you are responsible for coding and approving invoices, you will receive an e-mail notification that an invoice has arrived in your iPayit inbox.  You must log on to iPayit and take the appropriate action.  No one else can process the invoice for payment while it is in your iPayit inbox.  

We expect EWS to stay current and process the invoice within 5 days of notification.  We will continue to monitor the status of accounts payable and expect to see significant improvement by the end of September.

If you need assistance processing outstanding invoices, please contact Christa Winfrey at christa.winfrey@enron.com. 


IN THE NEWS    

Judge Delays California Refund Report Until March 8

Washington, Sept. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The judge who will recommend whether Enron Corp., Duke Energy Corp. and other power sellers owe California as much as $8.9 billion in refunds for electricity sales has postponed his recommendations until March 8.

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative judge Bruce Birchman said today that California's grid operator needs more time to collect information about power sales during the October-through-January refund period. This is the second time he postponed his report. Birchman originally said he would make his recommendations to the commission by Nov. 5, then delayed it to Dec. 13.

California demanded the refunds, charging that the power sellers inflated electricity prices. Power providers blame the fourfold increase in the average price of power in California from January to June compared with a year earlier on supply not keeping up with demand.

``I'm not surprised the judge is having trouble finding evidence because I don't think that refunds are due from anybody,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron Commences Authorization Process for New Power Plant in Italy
Enron has begun an application procedure to get the necessary consent to develop a natural gas fired combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power station of up to 1,200MW on a 10-hectare site 1.5km from Roveleto di Cadeo, in the Comune of Cadeo, in the Province of Piacenza (NorthEast Italy).  The following consents must be received before Enron's proposals for a power station can be implemented:

- Decree of Environmental Compatibility from the Ministry of the Environment, 
- Authorization to construct and operate the plant from the Ministry of Industry
- All other necessary local and national permits for construction and operation of the plant, including administrative authorizations and power and gas line connections.

The authorization process is expected to take around two years, such that construction could begin in early 2004, with operation 30-36 months from construction start.  However, the decision to proceed with construction of the project will remain contingent on further developments in the liberalization of the Italian power and gas markets.

 "This is the first time one of our Italian asset development projects has moved forward since our jointly-owned Sarlux IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) plant in Sardinia went into full commercial operation in December 2000," says Ross Sankey who is leading Enron's Cadeo project team.  "We're pleased to have identified such a suitable site for a new power plant and continue to assess other similar opportunities."

GasMarktFax Stirs "Trouble" in German Incumbent-dominated Gas Market
Following on from a recent GlobalFlash! report on the launch of GasMarktFax by the German origination team we are pleased to provide the following update on the impact the product is beginning to have on the German gas market:  

European Spot Gas Markets reported on Thursday, 13 September, that Ruhrgas will decrease prices for their Stadtwerke and regional gas companies as of 1 October.  The article mentions that it is clear that Ruhrgas is taking competition seriously and that last month's release of Enron's GasMarktFax provided Stadtwerke with the opportunity to compare their standard price to Enron offers.  "Pricing pressure pushes incumbents to lower their tariffs," said Helge-Jurgen Beil, director with the German origination team, who lead the GasMarktFax initiative.  "However, it is important to note that incumbents try to crowd out marginal supplies and abuse their dominant supplier position.  Grid access is still cumbersome and only very few customers have a real choice," Helge-Jurgen added.

Enron Signs First Trading Deal in Poland
Enron's Polish team have signed the company's first ever trading deal in the country - which is also the first transaction entered into by a Polish power trading company based on the EFET (European Federation of Energy Traders) Master Trading Agreement.

The 50MW deal is with PKE, currently Poland's largest generator by installed capacity, responsible for around 17% of total energy production in Poland.

The deal with PKE is effectively a series of 51 call options, each one of them being a separate option for 50MW of baseload power for any given calendar month. Enron is the buyer of this series of options. The first month for which Enron will have a call option will be October 2001, and the last will be December 2005. The exercise date for each option is 26 days before the beginning of the delivery month. The strike prices follow a pre-determined schedule.

"This pioneering agreement sets new standards of power trading in Poland," declares Jarek Dybowski, Enron's director of power trading in Poland.

"This deal has set a precedent and created a platform for us to further break into the bilateral wholesale electricity trading market in Poland," adds Jarek Astramowicz, Enron's vice-president and head of the Polish office.  A big thank you to Jarek Dybowski, Tomasz Krzyzewski, Sid Cox, Marcus Zwinger, Pat Cini and Jason Clatworthy and all the others who helped make this deal possible."

EBS Celebrates Neos Deal
Congratulations to EBS who secured a deal with Neos, a company that specialises in providing bandwidth within London and other UK cities (known as metro connectivity). The transaction gives Enron instant access to London's metro network, which expands Enron's coverage. The agreement involves a  ?3 million take or pay commitment over ten years, with Enron receiving fixed prices and degradation for the capacity.
 
Marcello Romano, Vice President Bandwidth Trading, is delighted: "We needed to close a strategic deal to increase our metro coverage. Not only has this been achieved but the team negotiated well below market prices."

Launch of Nordic precipitation index
In another first for Enron, this week saw the launch by Enron Nordic Energy of a precipitation index based on rainfall levels in a number of locations.  The index will serve as a new weather trading instrument bringing more choice to the weather market and thereby promoting market liquidity.  Given the close relationship existing between precipitation levels and power prices in the Nordic region, the index will be of interest to both power traders and large hydro producers.  The index will serve as a new trading instrument enabling power traders to add to and refine their positions.  For the large hydro producers, the index will provide a benchmark for hedging their risk against fluctuations in rainfall.  The index will be based on a large number of locations available throughout the Nordic region, with 27 locations in all (19 in Norway and 8 in Sweden).

On the very day of the index launch, we were able to announce the completion of a deal with Norsk Hydro whereby we have constructed a specific index enabling Norsk Hydro to hedge its production volumes throughout the Nordic region.  

Given the amount of hydroproduction in the Nordic region - approximately 99% (116TWh/yr) in Norway and 50% (64TWh/yr) in Sweden - the index is likely to be of significant interest in the Nordic market.  In Norway and Sweden, about 70% of the supply side is hydro and the volume of this supply can deviate by around 10% from normal (and by up to 30% during extreme years).  The subsequent impact on prices is huge and the variation in produced volumes is of great concern to hydro producers.

Holden - below is the response to our position manager questions.
Let me know if you would like me to follow up on any of these.
Also have you seen the report screen for position?
You can save profiles of the reports you run, so you don't have to set it up everytime - it is very neat!!! 

1) How should the Traders mark their dailies (6 x 8 or 7 x 8)

         The daily values which the traders mark in the excel sheet is treated as 7 x 8 in portcalc even though the excel sheet displays it as 6 x 8. So in order to
         make sure that portcalc values the deals the same way as before, it is necessary for the traders to paste the 6 x 8 values in excel into the 7 x 8 column 
         of the position manager. This exception is only applicable to the daily portion of the off peak curve.


2) Is there a way to fill down on cells like you can in excel?

         There is no way of doing this right now. I'll make sure that we include this feature in future versions.


3) Is there a reason Rockies is set up as a region? - It is a basis to Palo - should
we set this up as a basis so they can mark this (currently it is flat to Palo)

      It is treated as a region by portcalc. It will adversely affect the portcalc result if we treat this as a basis.


4) When I go to mark the Basis - each one shows up twice in the drop down.
(ie Mead, Mead, Mona, Mona ........)

       I'll fix it ASAP

5) How are we supposed to be marking Sunday's?

    Currently Sundays are a percentage(75) of the peak curve. Only the front two months can be edited in the system. Rest of the values are automatically computed.
 
Also is there going to be a manual on the position managers for reference?

    We are in the process of writing a manual for the position manager.


Thanks Arun,
Heather

Tom/Mark,

Thanks for taking the time to review the introduction.  The purpose of the document will be for all parties in the west (TO's and participants) to discuss and address commercial seams which, if left unchecked, could develop with the implementation of RTO West and DSTAR.  The introduction is intended to be a summary of the needs of the market and discuss the development of good base-business practices west region-wide that the RTO's can use to implement common methodologies.

Kind Regards,

Dave

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like "Industry Overviews" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
"We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,"  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan

ht derivatives will be benchmarked against published indices for the three =
routes on the 'Baltic International' (BITRA) and International Independent =
Tanker Rate Assessment (IITRA) exchanges to help ship-owners (including oil=
 companies), charterers, traders and even banks with exposure to the shippi=
ng market, mitigate the volatility of the freight element of tanker voyages=
 traveling from Singapore to Japan (30,000 tonnes), the Caribbean to the US=
 Gulf (70,000 tonnes) and Rotterdam to New York (33,000 tonnes).  Derivativ=
es for the three routes will be managed out of the Singapore, Houston and L=
ondon offices respectively.  "Volatility of the tanker freight market has b=
een as high as 62% on some routes," explains Scott Moncrieff, Enron's direc=
tor of Liquids Freight Trading, based in London.  "This has increased the i=
mportance of freight in relative terms on most tanker routes"=20

"In nine months we have already traded more than 3 million tonnes of paper =
freight, with a value of more than USD 14 million on the existing 80,000 to=
nne Sullom Voe (North Sea) to Willemshaven (Germany) route, and we expect t=
o achieve similar levels of interest on our three new routes.  The tanker f=
reight market is estimated to be worth more than USD 15 billion annually, a=
nd with increased liquidity being brought to the sector because of more pla=
yers entering the market there's plenty of opportunity for us to build our =
business."

The tanker freight team is also very heavily involved in the physical chart=
ering of tanker vessels in Europe, The Americas, Arabian Gulf, Mediterranea=
n, Far East and US West Coast, utilizing both the spot shipping market and =
Enron-controlled 'time-charter' vessels.

Nordic Pre-Pay Deal
The Nordic origination team has closed their first municipality power pre-p=
ay deal in the last week. This is the first deal to be completed based on a=
 financing structure that Enron Nordic Energy negotiated with Den Norske Ba=
nk earlier this summer. The deal is an important reference for municipaliti=
es that are interested in raising cash without selling their ownership in l=
ocal power companies.

Steel Products
In March 2001 the European Steel Group commenced operations as an expansion=
 of the successful effort underway in North America.  The group offers both=
 physical and financial commodity grade steel products and serves as the on=
ly market-maker for a commodity market that is larger than that of crude oi=
l.  The mission is to introduce the concept of indexation and financial con=
tract to an industry where price transparency and risk management are virtu=
ally non-existent.  Physical and financial contracts for hot rolled and col=
d rolled steel are currently on offer via EnronOnline.  Interest from Europ=
ean producers and end-users is keen with the first financial transactions e=
xpected to close by the end of Q3.=20

Since the team's inception they have successfully completed transactions wi=
th counterparties in Kazakhstan, Egypt, and China amounting to nearly 50,00=
0 metric tonnes of steel. =20

Forest Products
Enron's European Forest Products group is now trading physical market pulp =
to complement the financial derivatives products already offered for the la=
st 2 years, increasing the volume under contract by 30%.=20

Over the past six months, the group has recruited physical pulp traders to =
handle its day-to-day physical pulp trading business.  "We have sourced lon=
g-term physical supplies of "market pulp" from around the world which will =
complement the financial derivative products we have already been offering,=
" explains Martin Holmes, Director of Enron's European Forest Product Opera=
tions.

By trading both physical and financial contracts, Enron is pioneering more =
creative pricing in the industry by offering physical and financial cash an=
d forward prices, as well as being the only market maker to quote longer da=
ted swaps.

The group is also actively looking at structured finance opportunities incl=
uding a number of inventory deals. These opportunities have arisen as the b=
enchmark pulp price for Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft (NBSK) has fallen =
by 45% over the past 6 months, leaving producers with high levels of pulp i=
nventory in warehouses.

On 2nd July, the group launched the first standard contract for Bleached Eu=
calyptus (BEK) pulp on EnronOnline, and is actively marketing to industry b=
rokers to adopt the contract as the benchmark index for pricing. The contra=
ct meets the commodity specifications of the BEK contract on the London Pul=
pex futures exchange, where Enron is the only market maker for all pulp fut=
ures contracts offered.

In addition to my current role of leading ENA's Wholesale Gas Structuring, I have been asked to take on ENA's Retail Gas Structuring for EES.  

I have asked Mark Breese to take the lead on all EES related activity effective immediately.  Mark will maintain a lead role on a couple of important wholesale transactions that are ongoing, but he will not be taking on any new wholesale deals.  Eric Moon will retain his lead role on all West Region deals and will take the lead on all new East Region deals.  Eric Boyt will retain his lead role for all Upstream and ECR deals, and will back up Eric Moon on new East Region deals as needed.  Santiago Garcia (Associate) has chosen to stay in Gas Structuring for his third rotation to contribute his needed experience to the team.  Finally, several Associates and Analysts are being added to Gas Structuring to handle increased Wholesale deal flow and the EES effort.

Mark Breese, Melissa Solis and I have moved to the 14th floor and we will office at the following locations:

	Mark Breese	EB-1457a
	Ed McMichael	EB-1456c
	Melissa Solis	EB-1456d

We are moving to the 14th floor to initially be closer to the EES business as well as free up space on the 32nd floor.  This move is temporary as all Gas Structuring (wholesale and retail) will be located together on the 6th floor in the new building.

The Fall Associate and Analyst Recruiting Super Saturdays are scheduled for Saturday, Nov 10 and Saturday, Nov 17.  The candidates arrive on Friday, are given a tour of the Floor and then presentations will be held thereafter.   The November 10 Event will be Analyst-level candidates.  The November 17 Event will be Associate-level candidates.

Now, here's the real info!    :  )

On both Fridays (Nov 9 & Nov 16) we will be sponsoring a get together (Happy Hour) at the Heathman for all the Associates & Analysts .  This means FREE drinks and food from 4:30 PM ---> 6:30 PM.  This will give you an opportunity to meet the candidates, check them out and if necessary "sell" them on Enron.

We will be sending out more reminders and confirmations, but block out your calendars for these two Fridays.  Let me know if you have any questions!

Group,
Some heads up for this weekend.  For CAPS problems see Mike Tully, his contact info is below.  Also, the generators should have their supps submitted already, but if you decide to sell them real-time be sure to withdraw their supplemental bids.  We are still short at Mead 230.  From HE 1 on Saturday to HE 22 at $50.34 at Mead 230 going to CRC (remember this schedule ends HE 22 on Friday before starting back up HE 1 on Saturday).  Finally, you may have already seen it in Kate's email but BLOOMBERG TRADES ARE FLAT BROKER FEES PER TRADE (WITH NO MW DISTINCTION), PLEASE CLICK OFF THE PER MW TOGGLE NEXT TO THE FEE.

Thanks and call me with any problems.
Bill

Hi Kate,
Melissa Murphy just notified me that there will be a list of about 10 counterparties (we do not have the list yet) to whom we will need to start sending confirmation letters for hourly deals.  That is no problem at all, except that I just pulled up the first two (Chris Foster specifically wanted us to confirm these two today) and they have the wrong energy type.  They should be CAISO energy.  These are deals #640353, and #640338.
I know that the hourly traders are not in the habit of making sure that these energy types are correct, but if we are going to confirm these, they need to make an effort to do so.  Will you please forward this to them and make sure that all of them are aware how important this will be for documentation purposes?
Thanks so much!
Kim

Hey guys,

  Just FYI- I entered transmission deal # 696342.1 for $192.19 to account for line losses on PAC transmission for the month of April.

  Please see me if you have any questions.

Hey Guys, 
Please check congestion for all imports coming into California for Flow Date: Monday 11.12.0, on Sunday, 11.11.01, during the interim market            (about 11AM).  STSW is especially concerned with the PV import.  To check CONG, see the OASIS Web Site: http://oasis.caiso.com/, transmission tab, DA Interim: Branch Group Congestion Usage Charges.    If there is congestion during the interim market in excess of .02, please call me @ 503.804.7982.  Thanks, Serena

From:  Mark Frevert, Chairman & CEO
      Mark Haedicke, Managing Director & General Counsel
 
Subject:  Confidential Information and Securities Trading
 
To keep pace with the fluid and fast-changing demands of our equity trading activities, Enron Wholesale Services ("EWS") has recently revised its official Policies and Procedures Regarding Confidential Information and Securities Trading ("Policies and Procedures"). These revisions reflect two major developments: (1) our equity trading activities have been extended into the United Kingdom, and (2) in an effort to streamline the information flow process, the "Review Team" will play a more centralized role, so that the role of the "Resource Group" is no longer necessary.You are required to become familiar with, and to comply with, the Policies and Procedures. The newly revised Policies and Procedures are available for your review on LegalOnline, the new intranet website maintained by the Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department. Please click on the attached link to access LegalOnline:
 
<http://legalonline.corp.enron.com/chinesewall.asp>
 
If you have already certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, you need not re-certify at this time, although you are still required to to review and become familiar with the revised Policies and Procedures. If you have not certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, then you must do so within two weeks of your receipt of this message. The LegalOnline site will allow you to quickly and conveniently certify your compliance on-line with your SAP Personal ID number. If you have any questions concerning the Policies or Procedures, please call Bob Bruce at extension 5-7780 or Donna Lowry at extension 3-1939.

There are no changes...
 
 
There will be no substantial heat in California  this week. In fact, temperatures wil actually average below normal for  Monday-Wednesday before warming at the end of the week. Although there is some  possibility of above to much above normal temperatures in California and the  Desert Southwest, it seems more likely that at least a partial start to the  monsoon thunderstorms will occur. Since the normal high is 104 in Phoenix, I  would opt for 1-2 degrees above normal as an average for the week. 
 
The Pacific Northwest will see below normal  temperatures for the next 10-14 days on average. 
Above normal precipitation for the time of  year...
 
Dave

Jeff Richter will be transitioning off of the Short Term California trading desk and on to the EES Risk Management team during the next several weeks.  Jeff will be taking an important leadership role, joining the management team with Don Black and Rogers Herndon.  Jeff, Don, and Rogers will report jointly to me and Kevin Presto.  While Jeff will be sorely missed in his current role managing the Short Term California desk, his trading and technology skills are sorely needed on the EES side of the business.  Over the next couple of weeks we will sort out the new responosibilities on the Short Term California desk.

I would like to thank everyone that contributed to the Beach Bowl 2001 for ALS.  My grandmother passed away from this debilitating disease in 1986 and since then there has been only one small breakthrough in the treatment.  Hopefully with your donations and those of others we can make a difference for those suffering from ALS. It means a great deal to me that you were able to help out even though the event was so far away from Portland. Thank you again for your support and I miss everyone.

1.  When you buy from the imbalance(Services 2mw for HE 17-22) please make sure that you buy from the correct zone(i.e.  if finals have sp load dec'd then the buy from the imbalance in enpower needs to be in sp).  Day shift, assumed the ISO would make a buy from NP and for 3 hours they dec'd SP load.  Even better if you know that you are going to buy from the imbalance then submit a schedule that is BALANCED,  in this case they should have created a new load zone in SP under the Services book and inserted a -2 for HE 17-22.  As always we don't want to buy from the imbalance but if all other options have been exhausted then at least submit your preferred zone to purchase from rather than leaving the ISO to roll the dice and force balance you how ever they want.

2.  Unless I have been informed incorrectly, we should be accounting for bloomberg fees as a fee rather than sticking it the price.  This should make the SAR and settlements just a little easier.

Agency has deployed 130 engines to fire lines

SACRAMENTO - The Governor's Office of Emergency Services is working
day and night at its headquarters and in the field to rapidly deploy
additional fire crews to the Northern California fire lines.

As of now, OES has dispatched 130 state OES and local government
engines to battle numerous stubborn  blazes including the Emigrant
Gap fire in the Tahoe National Forest near Interstate-80.

At OES Headquarters, resource requests are being managed by the State

Emergency Operations Center and the Inland Region Emergency
Operations Center, which have been activated. Fire & Rescue, Law
Enforcement, Telecommunication, and Operations staff of OES are all
active in this effort at headquarters and in the field.

Emigrant Gap Fire is one of more than seven Northern California fires

being closely monitored by OES. Combined, the fires have burned
approximately 107,000 acres. All fires combined bring the total
OES-coordinated response to 26 fire engine strike teams working
107,000 acres (see chart for participating cities and counties)
alongside other local, federal and state agencies. 

The local and state-owned equipment has been dispatched through
California's Fire and Rescue Mutual Aid System, administered by OES,
to assist the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection,
and federal wildland fire agencies, and local departments.  The
system is designed to ensure that additional resources are provided
to local jurisdictions whenever their own resources are committed or
insufficient for any fire or rescue operation.

Each strike team consists of five fire engines - with three to four
firefighters per engine - and one strike team leader per team. 
	
Four of the seven fires are being battled by local firefighters
called to duty by OES under the Mutual Aid system:

Arun is going to have to bring down the Curve Manager due to these issues:
No 10/31/01 or 11/1/01, due to this ST is having to mark 12/1/01.
Arun is going to fix these issues: he will have to bring it down and then back up.
In about 20min (10:45) please log out and login -> then check to see what needs to be remarked.

Subject:	 Index Option

We have the approval from the business unit (Matt Motley) to implement Index Option deal type as such:

Index Option will be a physical option with a strike @ an Index.
For a BDay option expiry the analysis will work as follows:

The forward position will be valued taking the deal strip hours, these hours
will be valued against the scalars - the hours in the money compared
to the forward underlying price will be estimated as exercised. Only the hours
in the money will be evaluated.  For the day of exercise the hours evaluated will
be the hours exercised in scheduling. 

Daily the Option Exercise function in Enpower will create an Index Forward Leg
from the Index Option (expiry will be daily but the price will be hourly) @ a strike of the specified Index.

Liquidation:
Liquidation for the next day will be calculated using the actual exercised strip against the curve as the mid price.
The True-up will be index vs curve when the index is published.


This is how we would analyze each hour.  
The sum of each hour will be the value of the option.

For each hour:
HE7 = 
Strike = Forward Price (since Index is not available)
Underlying = Forward Price * scalar
Vol = Daily Vol
Rate = Libor
Time = same as daily (treated as a daily option for time)

Vo =f(u,s,v,r,t)
V = Intrinsic + Extrinsic

Buy Call: Estimated Exercised hour will have a price above the mid
Buy Put: Estimated Exercised hour will have a price below the mid

Daily the Option Exercise function in Enpower will create an Index Forward Leg
from the Index Option (expiry will be daily but the price will be hourly) @ a strike of the specified Index.

Liquidation:
Liquidation for the next day will be calculated using the actual exercised strip against the curve as the mid price.
The True-up will be index vs curve when the index is published.

For the past several weeks, we have been working diligently to receive the parking subsidy from Houston.  However, due to the bankruptcy filing Enron has not been able to process checks.  

For the month of December, you will be personally responsible for your parking. This includes all parking lots (Lot 108, Lot 303, the WTC parking garage) and any parking validations.  

If you have been parking in Lot 108, Lot 303 or Lot 2WTC, your responsibility begins 12/1/01.  For those parking in other lots, we will be unable to reimburse employees for the month of December.

For those who have a payroll parking deduction, we will stop the deduction on the 12/31/01 pay period.  Grace and I are working on a resolution plan for the monies that were deducted incorrectly, so please be patient as we work through the various issues. 

It has not been determined whether Enron will continue to subsidize parking but you will be notified as soon as we receive information from Corporate.

We sincerely apologize for the insufficient notice and the inconvenience that this may have caused.  Again, thank you for the patience.  We are all trying to do our best in a difficult situation!

The carpet in our office is scheduled to be professionally cleaned on the evening of Wednesday, June 6.  The Facilities office at World Trade Center is requesting we pick up trash cans, floor mats, boxes, etc., from the floor so they can effectively clean most of the carpets.

Therefore, before you leave work on Wednesday, June 6, PLEASE pick up trash cans, floor mats, boxes, etc., from the floor so the carpet can be cleaned.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Group,

There are two new paths for EPE information.

The first is for EPE schedules:
This path is P:/Trading/Real Time/El Paso Schedules/Admin/El Paso Schedules/2002/Feb02/EPE_FEB_02

The second is for the EPE models:
M:/Electric/EPE/EPE 2002/Models/February02/...

The estate will be settling CAPS each day (creating DA and HA finals) beginning on Friday. 

Please work closely with John and Dave to get all problems resolved as quickly as possible.

Thanks,
Bill

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

An old scam has surfaced recently with renewed vigor.  The Nigerian-419 fraud letter, so called because it violates section 419 of Nigerian law, is sent in many variations, by surface and airmail as well as by fax and email.  Generally the form it takes is to ask the unsuspecting victim to provide their bank account information in return for a promise to deposit a very large sum of money into that account under some pretext.

Employees should be advised that any information given will be used to further promote the scam through the emptying out of bank accounts, counterfeit and forged checks being written against the accounts, and for other illegal purposes.

If you receive what you believe to be one of these letters, forward it to Mike Hicks (Michael.Hicks@enron.com).  Corporate Security maintains a file on them, and works with the US Secret Service to reduce the number of letters received by our employees.

For more information on these letters, please email or call Mike at (713) 853-6198.

I will confirm deal numbers with the desk.  Its our understanding (per the 1:30 CST call) that we are continuing to make deliveries to WALC, which is WAPADESERTSW, and Edwards AFB, which is believed to be WAPADESERTSWAFB.  We will definitively identify WAPADESERTSW and Edwards deal numbers.

and 98773	Western Area Power Administration-Desert Southwest Region (USAFB)	WAPADESERTSWAFB

were terminated as well only the desks of two deals  852890 and 853003 should be changed
from EPMI Long Term Southwest to EPMI - West Performance 


Casey, can you do that with Deal Entry for me please so I can avoid one long procedure for two deals.

Thanks,

 Stephen,

Now we have the question
if the deals with

29894	Deseret Generation & Transmission Coop.	DESERETGENTRAN

or 

      47358	Western Area Power Administration-Desert Southwest Region	            WAPADESERTSW
and 98773	Western Area Power Administration-Desert Southwest Region (USAFB)	WAPADESERTSWAFB

had to be on the list


As a matter of fact we are talking for fixing maximum 6 deals:
(Deseret Generation & Transmission Coop. was not changed in two only)

Deal No
552607	Western Area Power Administration-Desert Southwest Region		EPMI - West Performance 
622299	Western Area Power Administration-Desert Southwest Region (USAFB)	EPMI - West Performance 
638076	Western Area Power Administration-Desert Southwest Region (USAFB)	EPMI - West Performance 
705583	Western Area Power Administration-Desert Southwest Region		EPMI - West Performance 
852890	Deseret Generation & Transmission Coop.				EPMI Long Term Southwest
853003	Deseret Generation & Transmission Coop.				EPMI Long Term Southwest

which could be done with Deal Entry as well


Thanks,
Kroum

WAPA Deseret is probably associated with Deseret G&T.  I suspect WAPA is purchasing power on behalf of the G&T to meet its obligations.

Kroum,

Hopefully this helps:

WALC - WAPA Lower Colorado - Western Area Power Administration-Desert Southwest Region
WAMP - WAPA Municipal Power-NP15 - Western Area Power Administration - Sacramento Area Office
WAPA Deseret - Western Area Power Administration-Desert Southwest Region (USAFB)	

It looks like the only one you haven't run is the WAPA Sacramento Area Office.

Let me know if you have any more questions.  Thanks.

Steve

We are 7 MW long all hours at Montana System,  which is our buy from MPC, deal number 615780.1

The upstream is PSEI-DUKE-WWP-MPCO.

We put in a false schedule to Smurfit to get flat preschedule, and that tag is 23795.

When we get close to HE 0100 on Monday, that Tag needs to go away, and the energy needs to be sold.

Please don't say it was a false preschedule, just say that it was 'unexpectedly ramped down' or something.

Enpower accurately reflects the length at Montana System

Please note a new version of curve manager has been tested in the Stage environment which include below features:

1. We will be able to mark Swaption Volatility -- In the past (current version of curve manager you are using) we only have one set of volatility curves which is being applied to the calculations of option deal type but for swaptions our calculation is using the volatility in the deal entry.  The new version of curve manager allows us the mark a seperate volatility curve for swaption deal type, for informational purpose only at this stage.  Our calculation system will continue to use the volatility specific to each swaption in deal entry until further notice.

2. In the past if you mark the long term (by month) price "change" column directly in the curve manager for certain month, the curve manager will automatically apply the same change to be the same price change for the same month in all other years.  In the new version, this "automatic" feature will be removed.  Please note if you mark long term curves by doing copy and paste from Excel rather than by marking the curve change directly in the curve manager, this "automatic" feature has not affected you in the past and will not affect you in the new version.

Risk has tested above changes to the curve manager successfully.  Please let us know as soon as possible if you have other concerns by Monday (10/22) or we will ask IT to release the new version.

Thanks,

Fran

          This Sunday, starting at 5:00 AM, Emergency Power Systems for the WTC Complex will shut down to test the emergency backups. 

This will not affect critical systems (computer room, phones, or the Real Time Group), as they are on both UPS and Generator. 

It will affect many of the non - critical computers and office machines on the 3rd and 4th floors of Enron. 
Please make every effort to power down all of your PC's and monitors when you leave for the day. Also, if you could help with a machine or 2 in your immediate area we would appreciate it. 

The IT group will be coming through around 4-4:30 today to power down equipment not in use and I will be in before the outage on Sunday to complete this. 

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the IT dept. at any time. 
Regards

I would like for this product to trade for Sunday and Monday together.  It would be like the Sunday-Monday light load product that now exists except we are stripping out the HE 7-22 on Sunday.  Therefore I would like to include the non-holiday Monday.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Also, any word on the Pinnacle Peak delivery point?  We do not need to provide a bus as this is a common delivery point.
 
Thank You,

Looks okay so long as Holden confirms that he want the delivery days to cover Sunday and Monday only.  I get Monday if the Monday is a holiday.  Holden, do you also want to cover a non-holiday Monday?

Subject:	Bloomberg Fees

I spoke with Bloomberg's Paul Callahan.  He confirmed that all daily trades are a $15 flat fee.  On the case of a spread trade like we executed yesterday the $15 flat fee still applys.  Although a spread trade implies two trades, only $15 is charged for the whole package.  Please let me know if you have any more questions.  Also, what do we need to do to change the default in Enpower to better reflect the fee structure.  I believe that term trades are still on the old rate basis.

Thank You,
Holden

E-Survey Response

We recently asked you to participate in the EFCU 2001 E-Survey.  More than 3,000 Enron employees took the time to respond to our survey.  Your honest opinions and time are appreciated and will help us continue to bring you products and services that you deem important in your life, as well as the service that you expect.

We are pleased to report these areas where you have had a positive experience (based on Good, Very Good, and Excellent ratings), in comparison to last year's ratings:

				2001	2000
	Friendliness		88%	84%
	Courtesy		89%	84%
	Knowledge/Training	86%	80%
	Range of Services	87%	82%
	Saving Interest Rates	66%	60%
	Loan Interest Rates	65%	58%
	Quality of Service	88%	84%
	Communications	84%	79%
	Web Portal		72%	N/A
	Service Wait Time	79%	68%


Of course, there is always room for improvement.  Based on your written comments, we have determined these areas where we would like to improve:

ATM Access - We are working with various vendors to develop a program that offers you more free ATM access options and hope to be able to offer this program soon.  We will let you know as soon as a program is available.  In the meantime, members are encouraged to get cash one of these ways to avoid fees:

-  Use your VISA Check Card to get cash back at merchants.  These are fee-free transactions.
-  Use our ATM in the lobby of the Enron Building or 3 Allen Center, or try the approximate 100 fee-free ATMs in the Houston area that display the Select ATM logo (visit enronfcu.com for locations).	
-  Visit one of our Service Center branches (visit enronfcu.com for locations).
-  We will also waive our fee on 3 unaffiliated ATM transactions per month.


Phone Accessibility - In January 2001, we established a phone center to answer incoming calls to our main number.  An automated system initially prompts you, but the option to speak to a live operator is available.  Your call may be forwarded to an EFCU representative, and you may get voice mail.  In this instance, we will return your call as soon as possible.

Should you get voice mail, it will help us process your request more efficiently if you leave your name, phone number, member number and the nature of your call.  You may also contact us via e-mail at efcu@enron.com, and we will respond as soon as possible.


Wait Lines - Unfortunately, due to space constraints, we are unable to expand our financial services area (new accounts) right now.  We do recognize that this does at times cause a back up and apologize for the inconvenience.  We are making plans to expand when possible.

We added several tellers this year to help the traffic flow in the teller area and are now filled to capacity at all stations.  As you know, the teller lines are sometimes heavy on paydays.  To help minimize your wait time, here are a few other options to handle your transactions:

-  Make deposits & withdrawals at our ATMs in the Enron Building Lobby or 3 Allen Center.  Deposits are retrieved between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m. and are posted the same day.
-  Make deposits at our Night Drop Box on the 3rd floor of the Enron Building, outside of the EFCU front doors.  The Night Drop Box is checked throughout the day and transactions are posted the same day if received by 5:00 p.m.
-  Sign up for Direct Deposit.  It's convenient, fast and safe.  Go to ehronline.enron.com to sign up.
-  Sign up for QuickLink - Internet Account Access.  QuickLink is free and allows you to verify cleared checks and posted deposits, transfer funds and more, all from the convenience of your computer.  Sign up at enronfcu.com.
-  Sign up for QuickTeller - Automated Phone System.  QuickTeller is also a free service that allows you to perform all of the same functions as QuickLink, but by telephone.  Go to enronfcu.com to sign up.

Thank you again for your feedback.  We look forward to the opportunity to bring you more of the latest financial services as they become available in the market.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

We have reached resolution regarding the parking and mass transit issue.  Until notified otherwise, the parking and mass transit subsidy will continue as an employee benefit. 

For those who have a payroll parking deduction, your deduction has been stopped.  No deduction should occur on 12/31/01 payroll.  In addition, you should receive a credit for the deduction taken for the 12/15 payroll.  

For those who incurred any out-of-pocket parking costs during the month of December, you may expense up to $89 for reimbursement.  

Beginning 1/1/02, parking and mass transit will continue as follows:

WTC Parking:  You should receive your parking pass in the mail. Payroll deductions will begin on the 1/15/02 paycheck. (No Action Req'd)

Outside Parking Lots:  Park at lot of your choice and pay out of pocket.  Request reimbursement of up to $89 per month. (No payroll parking deduction will occur)

Tri-Met and MAX employees:  Passes are available for January.  If you would like to pick up your pass, please see Debra Davidson.   

NOTE:  Extra Tri-Met passes are available.  If you would like to select mass transit as your parking option, please notify either Grace or myself before Friday, 12/21/01 EOB and we will insure a monthly pass is available.

Validations:  We will no longer validate parking passes, however, you are able to reimburse up to $89 per month for daily parking.

If you have any questions, please let us know!

FYI -

We've added Burke (Mid-Columbia) as a new delivery point in Enpower. I know some of you have already traded at this point, so if you have a record of the deals you've entered, it might be a good idea to go back and correct the delivery point to read "Burke."

Thanks,
Kate

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS 

Enron Global Markets - Coal and Emissions Trading 
The first Enron Online synfuel trade occurred this past week, establishing EnronOnline as the only online marketplace for synfuel.  The purpose of bringing synfuel on EnronOnline is to provide market transparency between the coal/synfuel spread.  

The coal cash book, which began trading only two months ago, has traded over 2 million spot tons.  The fundamental purpose of this book is to capture short term market discrepancies, while also adding liquidity to the spot market to further long term trading and marketing of coal.  

Enron Energy and Operational Services - ENA Solid Fuel Initiative 
ENA started development of a Coal Initiative late last year to support the electricity trading desk and to provide Enron with a hedge in the event that the cost of natural gas continues to escalate above current long term projections.  Because of the culture shock associated the use of the words  'Enron' and 'coal' in the same sentence, consideration was been given to changing the name to DNG (Dense Natural Gas); however, we went with Solid Fuel Initiative.

This initiative is developing multiple sites throughout the country where ENA feels there is the greatest opportunity for long term corporate benefit.  The primary areas are Texas, Florida, southeastern Ohio and the central Rocky Mountain Area.  There are 2 principal areas currently being aggressively pursued:  Brownsville, TX and Brighton FL.  In Brownsville, the Team secured formal Owner approval to lease a 600 acre site near the Brownsville Ship Channel.  This approval will allow the formal permitting activities to proceed without delay.

A 500 MW facility is being considered for Brownsville.  As conceptualized, it will consist of two - 250 MW (net) CFB units (Circulating Fluidized Bed) Boilers. The boilers will be fired by petroleum coke (petcoke) and use a technology that will generate electricity in the most environmentally friendly way currently possible.  One of the advantages of locating this facility near Brownsville is that it remains a steady growth area and there is already serious interest by others to take substantial initial base load capacity.  There is further synergy with other developing projects in the area that could lock down additional base capacity.  As stated the plant is initially 500 MW, but will be designed to be expanded to a 1000 MW facility.

The EEOS team is starting to grow and currently includes Hilda Akin & Cheryl Kent, Project Admin Assistants, Bill Fox as PEM, and Paula Solomon as PCM.  As the project develops there will be more team members required.  In addition, as the Florida opportunity develops we plan to establish a separate team.   

eSource 
eSource, Enron's research group, recently posted on its website a Forrester report as well as analyst reports for various industry and companies.  These reports are free and available to all Enron employees on the eSource Hot Topics page at http://esource.enron.com/hot_topics.asp <http://esource.enron.com/hot_topics.asp>.  To date, over 1,600 employees have downloaded "Spending Wisely on Private Hubs", a report valued at $2,000.  Over 1,100 employees to date have viewed the analyst reports, provided by Investext.  The reports, which are updated continuously, are presented in folders by company and industry.  New folders are being added upon request.  To submit a suggestion for a new folder, please complete the suggestion form at http://esource.enron.com/suggestion.asp <http://esource.enron.com/suggestion.asp>.  

Watch for the new eSource bulletin, The Source.  It will feature frequently requested searches, tips on finding information, new products, services, and events.

Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's information needs, eSource has arranged for analysts and bureau chiefs of various organizations and publishing houses to offer seminars to Enron employees.  

Enron Freight Markets 
EFM signed a firm contract with Streamline Shippers Association last week to provide truckload capacity for one-year with EFM's option to extend the contract for up to an additional year.  Streamline transloads international shipments that enter the U.S. through the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles.  Streamline then consolidates the shipments into full truckloads destined to the major population centers throughout the country.  EFM will begin moving shipments to northeast destinations this week.

Enron In Talks With 3 Financial Companies For Joint Venture 
Updated: Monday, December 3, 2001 06:52 PM ET 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. is negotiating with three financial institutions of "impeccable creditworthiness" regarding a joint venture aimed at restarting its trading operation, said Martin Bienenstock, a lawyer for the company. 
Enron expects to announce its joint venture partner within weeks, according to Bienenstock. 
The joint venture would use that institution's financial means to guarantee that Enron would pay its bills. 
Also Monday, at a court hearing Enron announced $1.5 billion in debtor in possession financing from a syndicate led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. 
The company said that it needs about $250 million for immediate operating needs. Currently, Enron has about $500 million in cash.

As of 6/2/01, our lawyers have not signed any agreement with CERS, and therefore we still are not allowed to trade with them.

Because I have to go to a PRC meeting all Day, and Donald will be out that Day,  here is the plan:

Stacy moves to MidC to train with Donald all next week, 

Cara schedules the Rockies all next week

When Donald Returns, he trains with Cara until he is ready to take over, and then takes the Rockies.


We wanted to do it anyway, now we have a reason.

During the past few days several people have approached us wondering why we=
 are continuing to do college recruiting and continuing with the floor buil=
d out given the state of the company today.  We appreciate people's concern=
s about adding people and spending money at a time when we ought to be redu=
cing unnecessary expenses.  Let us begin by saying that we share these conc=
erns and are not hiring people or undertaking significant capital expenditu=
res without a great deal of thought.  We would also encourage people to tal=
k to their manager or either of us if you don't understand why we are doing=
 certain things.  In short, we have decided to continue with the college re=
cruiting, although we have not yet decided how many, if any, we will hire. =
 We have decided to delay the beginning of the floor build out for a couple=
 of weeks.

Why Are We Continuing With College Recruiting?
During the last few years we have made tremendous progress establishing a p=
resence for Enron broadly and the Portland office specifically with leading=
 schools in the northwest.  This past year we finally reached critical mass=
 and had tremendous success in our recruiting efforts.  Although we are unc=
ertain about our hiring needs this year, we feel that it is in our best lon=
g term interest to continue having a presence with the schools in the north=
west.  We have already made presentations and done initial screenings at mo=
st schools.  We have identified the best people from each school and have a=
lready made plans for them to come to our office for two super Saturdays.  =
The cost to us to finish this process is not large compared to the benefit =
that we gain from honoring our commitment to the schools and students as pa=
rticipants in their on-campus recruiting programs.  We also realize that it=
 is a hard year to be coming out of school looking for a job.  It is our be=
lief that students would rather interview with us even if the possibilities=
 of employment may be somewhat diminished.  Finally, we would like to empha=
size the point that we have not yet committed to hiring anybody.  We will i=
nterview people, identify the best candidates, and make hiring decisions ba=
sed on the needs of the office.  Before extending offers we will consider t=
he potential impact that it could have on people in this office and Enron e=
mployees in other offices who have been redeployed.  Stated another way, we=
 don't intend to hire a bunch of new people if there are people within Enro=
n who could fill positions or if it would put the jobs of the people alread=
y here at risk.  We may end up postponing hiring decisions until we are mor=
e certain about the state of affairs in the company.

How Will the Floor Move Play Out?
We have decided to postpone the floor build out for a few weeks.  While we =
still think that it makes sense for the office, we have decided to pause fo=
r a couple of weeks before we start to spend significant amounts of money o=
n this.  When talking to the build out team today it became clear that dela=
ying would accomplish several goals.  First, it allows us to get final arch=
itectural plans in place and firm quotes from contractors so that we can mo=
re precisely peg down the costs before moving forward.  Second, it gives th=
e build out team breathing room to iron out more of the details of the move=
.  Finally, it buys us a little more time to decide whether or not it makes=
 sense to do this project given the state of affairs of the company right n=
ow.  While we still think that we are going to move forward with this proje=
ct, it seems like buying a couple of weeks of time is the right thing to do=
 right now.  In about two weeks we will reconvene with the build out team w=
ith firm budget numbers and make a decision to either move ahead, cancel, o=
r delay again. =20

As always, we will try to keep people updated on things as soon as new, rel=
iable information becomes available.  We recognize that this is a very hard=
 time for everyone.  Please try to stay focused on the job at hand and keep=
 up the success of this office.

As the November elections approach, I encourage everyone to exercise your right to be heard and to make a difference through your vote.  To do so, you'll need to have a valid voter's registration.  If you do need to register, please visit your county's website or call your county election officials to learn the procedures and timing.

For Houston-based employees:
The deadline for voter registration in Texas is October 9.  Voter registration forms are available at the InfoZone in the lobby, but if you choose to mail your form please allow enough time for the postal service to deliver your form.  See the following list if you need to obtain election information pertaining to Harris and surrounding counties.

Subject:	New from FriedWire...


Good morning to all of you at Enron.
 
I wanted to make you all aware of two major new capabilities that FriedWire is soon to deploy.  One will be the new PJM intelligence module that will be an add-on to the existing Traffic Report.  The other is a brand new version of the Traffic Report itself that incorporates real-time electricity prices and news/commentary from THE major provider of this content.  FriedWire will be making some announcements shortly describing the strategic alliance between our firm and this content partner, and should be able to start showing the enhanced, jointly developed version of the Traffic Report in October.
 
Regarding the PJM module; we are now scheduling 30-40 minute, remote (Internet-based) overviews with clients who actively trade in PJM.  These will begin the week of September 24th.  If any of you or your colleagues would like to participate in a very informal session that looks at the capabilities of this new tool, please contact me and I can help set-up a date and time.  Some of the content and functionality in the PJM module includes:
 
}         Real time price and loadcharts that present current conditions in historical context
}         Real-time and day-ahead LMP data along with the public FTR data to provide a real-time estimate of FTR value
}         Easy interface for querying FTR data to provide competitive intelligence in the primary and secondary FTR markets
}         Tools for valuing FTRs in the monthly FTR auction
}         PJM load charts displaying PJM ISO load forecast bias
}         Eastern Interconnect frequency monitoring
}         LMP charts and maps
}         Customizable displays in the form of personalized Watchlists, tables and chart building tools
 
Thanks and contact me with anything you might need.
 
Take Care, 
 
Stuart Wright
Director
FriedWire Inc.

Hi Lynn,

According to my records, I do not see where we used  our WAPA transmission on May 12th or May 20th.

I do see purchases from WAPA at Midway on those days, but losses are not billable to Enron on those purchases as the energy was purchased at Midway.

My tags are as follows:

May 12th. Day total of 370,  tag 22299

May 20th,  Day total of 55,  Tag # 22803

If your records indicate that we used WAPA transmission on our own account for those days, please provide me the OASIS number that was assigned to this transmission.

Thank you

Cara

Attached please find an Excel spreadsheet depicting the losses Enron owed WACM, and amounts deficit for May 2001.

The one spreadsheet contains day to day transactions "EnronMay2001.xls" and the other "EnronMaybilldetail.xls" contains calculations of the shortages, with the amount billable being depicted, $6,295.97.

Please feel free to call me if you have questions or concerns or have tag information that may alleviate some of these charges.

This will appear on the May bill to be issued within the next week or so.  Thank you.

Dear Colleague,

This note is to inform you that, effective January 3, 2002, PIRA Energy
Group will terminate delivery of the Energy Retainer Services, which we
have been providing Enron for almost a decade.  This action is based on
the instructions we received from your company last month. Your Online
password will be deactivated and your emails will cease.

We hope not only that you have found value and use from our comprehensive
fundamental analysis of oil, natural gas, and electricity markets, but that
you have enjoyed working with PIRA and its staff.  We have certainly
appreciated our close working relationship with Enron and we regret the
disruption. We certainly hope that we can restart a relationship with many
of you who will remain with Enron or move on elsewhere. Should it be the
case that you require continued delivery from, and Online access to, PIRA's
services, please respond to this email or contact Jeff Steele at
(212) 686-6808, or jsteele@pira.com.

To all of you, we wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.

Regards,

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ."  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."

As you may know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former
officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and state court. Some of
the litigation claims relate to the performance of the Broadband Services
Division.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests
in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to
preserve documents that might be used in the litigation.

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended
immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings,
e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way
relate to the performance of the Broadband Services Division, including, but
not limited to, the demand for bandwidth, the Company's efforts to create a
trading market for bandwidth, and the creditworthiness of participants in
the market for bandwidth.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement
of federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal
penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously. In the
meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone
other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.

If you have any questions, please contact Charles Schwartz at Vinson &
Elkins L.L.P. at 713-758-3852.

It appears that the following email may not have been clear.  You have to copy all documents yourself.

1.  Each person will have to move any data over personally from the old H drive (which is now Z:) drive to their new H drive.  
2. The Z: drive (old H:) will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

O Drives:
1. For the old O or M drives go to O:\ESTATE\ O (or M ? pending location of data) and copy to the new common O.  The Estate O and M will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

Do not delete anything and only copy information which is complies with the policy.  Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply.

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts."
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

Holden,

  Can you (Mark or Tom) provide any off-the-top-of-your-head information about El Paso?  Marina is doing a project in school and had the following question:

Virginia,

I am doing homework now, and I need your help. For my finance class, we are 
investing for real a 1 million $ in the stock market, my sector is Energy 
and I am doing a recommendation on Thursday this week. I am trying to decide 
between 2 stocks: one is El Paso Corp, the other one is Philips Petroleum. I 
know we do business with El Paso. Any valuable info that you can provide me 
with will be a great help (i.e. are they a good customer, how are they doing 
in your opinion, that type of info).
Sorry to bother you with this but it is really important. I will be making 
my presentation in front of the Trustees of the fund.

Thanks,

Marina

From: Governor's Office of Emergency Services

SACRAMENTO - This evening, the Governor's Office of Emergency
Services has dispatched 11 new strike teams (55 engines) to fires
burning throughout Northern California.  This includes 35 local
government and State OES engines that were dispatched to the Emigrant

Gap fire on an 'immediate need.'  Additionally, State OES has
activated its Inland Region Emergency Operations Center and State
Operations Center in Sacramento to coordinate response to the
Northern California fires.
	
Each strike team consists of five fire engines - with three to four
firefighters per engine - and a strike team leader.  The latest
strike teams are being dispatched from the following locations.   

EMIGRANT GAP FIRE
1 OES Strike Team 

1 OES Satellite Communication Trailer

Local Government Engines
Colusa County
Stanislaus County (2)
San Joaquin County 
Nevada County
Tahoe Basin


MODOC COMPLEX FIRE
Local Government Engines
Alameda County
Tahoe Basin

BLUE FIRE
1 OES Strike Team

Local Government Engines
Shasta County
 

Throughout Northern California and Nevada, eight fires have burned
upwards of 100,000 acres so far.  In addition to the recent group of
11 strike teams, OES has also deployed 99 other State OES and local
government fire engines, two state-of-the-art OES satellite
communication trailers, and numerous fire and telecommunications
staff to the Northern California fire lines.  

The local and state-owned equipment has been dispatched through
California's Fire and Rescue 
Mutual Aid System, administered by OES, to assist the California
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, and federal wildland fire

agencies, and local departments.  The system is designed to ensure
that additional resources are provided to local jurisdictions
whenever their own resources are committed or insufficient for a
specific fire.

Are you creative? Do you have a great imagination? Can you create something out of nothing? Are you fast on your feet?
If you answered yes to any or all of these questions, then I have a challenge for you!
We are looking to create a team of 7-10 people to build a model of Enron's attributes: Smart, Innovative, Bold, Ambitious, and United.  You will be provided with the building materials and you will have a total of 45 minutes to work along with your teammates to get your model completed.  Oh, did I mention that your materials will consist only of Legos?  That's right - LEGOS. 
Here is the layout -
			Friday, August 10th
			11:00 a.m. 	Teams assemble to begin construction.
			11:45 a.m. 	Construction is complete.
			12:00 p.m. 	Ken Lay will host - The Applause Meter. The winning team will then be recognized by Mr. Lay and he will 					follow up with an e-mail to all Houston employees.
Here are the guidelines -																
			1.  Teams must consist of 7-10 members from your Business Unit.  I need to have at least 3 executives (Directors, Vice 				     	     Presidents, or Managing Directors) to this team.   
			2.  The model must be free-standing. 
			3.  Your choice of other materials may be used!
Be sure to encourage your co-workers to come and cheer you on!  Please give me a call or e-mail me if you are interested in participating.  After the competition, the Legos will be donated to local non-profit child care centers.
Thank you,
Julie Clyatt

We are 25 mws long HE 7-22 at palo verde in the real-time position manager.  I printed a forward obligation report for the 20th and that report does not reflect this length.  After checking every deal at PV for the 20th against the forward obligation report it appears that our deals have been entered correctly.   I discussed this with Holden and he agrees there is no reason we should be long at PV for that day.  Therefore, the correct position at PV for the 20th is flat.  The length is false.  If you are aware of any deals that may have caused the real-time position manager to reflect this length, please let me know.

Thanks,

For your information, the World Trade Center is not allowing trucks from the postal service, UPS, Federal Express, etc., into the building; and therefore we will not be able to receive or send mail or overnight packages.  The mailroom personnel said we would be contacted when those services resume.

You guys might need to know this?..



        Five (5) Questions Most Feared By Men:

         1. What are you thinking about?
         2. Do you love me?
         3. Do I look fat?
         4. Do you think she is prettier than me?
         5. What would you do if I died?

         What makes these questions so difficult is that
         every one is guaranteed to explode into a major argument
         if the man answers incorrectly (i.e.,tells the truth).
Therefore,
         as a public service, each question is analyzed below, along
with
         possible responses.

     ____________________________________________________

         Question # 1: What are you thinking about?

         The proper answer to this, of course, is: "I'm sorry
         if I've been pensive, dear. I was just reflecting on what a
         warm,  wonderful, thoughtful, caring, intelligent woman you
are,
         and how lucky I am to havemet you."

         This response obviously bears no resemblance to the true
answer,
         which most likely is one of the following:

            a. Baseball.

            b. Football.

            c. How fat you are.

            d. How much prettier she is than you.

            e. How I would spend the insurance money if you died.

         Perhaps the best response to this question was
         offered by Al Bundy, who once told Peg, "If I wanted you to
         know what  I was thinking, I would be talking to you."

    _______________________________________________


        Question # 2: Do you love me?


        The proper response is: "YES!" or, if you feel a more
        detailed answer is in order, "Yes, dear."

        Inappropriate responses include:

          a. Oh Yeah, shit-loads.

          b. Would it make you feel better if I said yes?

          c. That depends on what you mean by love.

          d. Does it matter?

          e. Who, me?

     ____________________________________________________

        Question # 3: Do I look fat?

         The correct answer is an emphatic: "Of course not!"

         Among the incorrect answers are:

         a. Compared to what?

         b. I wouldn't call you fat, but you're not exactly thin.

         c. A little extra weight looks good on you.

         d. I've seen fatter.

         e. Could you repeat the question? I was jus thinking
            about how I would spend the insurance money if you died.

    ___________________________________________________

         Question # 4: Do you think she's prettier than me?

         Once again, the proper response is an emphatic:
         "Of course not!"

         Incorrect responses include:

         a. Yes, but you have a better personality

         b. Not prettier, but definitely thinner

         c. Not as pretty as you when you were her age

         d. Define pretty

         e. Could you repeat the question? I was just thinking
            about how I would spend the insurance money if you died.

     ____________________________________________________

        Question # 5: What would you do if I died?

         A definite no-win question. (The real answer, of course,
         is "Buy a Corvette and a boat").

         No matter how you answer this, be prepared for
         at least an hour of follow-up questions, usually
         along the these lines:

         WOMAN: Would you get married again?

         MAN: Definitely not!

         WOMAN: Why not-don't you like being married?

         MAN: Of course I do.

         WOMAN: Then why wouldn't you remarry?

         MAN: Okay, I'd get married again.

         WOMAN: You would? (with a hurtful look on her face)

         MAN: ( makes audible groan )

         WOMAN: Would you sleep with her in our bed?

         MAN: Where else would we sleep?

         WOMAN: Would you put away my pictures, and replace
         them with pictures of her?

        MAN: That would seem like the proper thing to do.

        WOMAN: And would you let her use my golf clubs?

        MAN: She can't use them; she's left-handed.

        WOMAN: - - - silence - - -

        MAN: shit.

Per our discussion - let me know if we need to look into this more to clarify.

Options:
Whether the option is in/out of the money - the delta will be calculated as an effective position per each $1 price change.
For example what we were looking at for October:  The Current Strike in deal entry is $30 - since the mid price is lower than that - when we take 
the scalars into effect and calculate an hourly price it is rarely in the money for CSU to exercise this option.  Therefore your delta is so low.


Forwards:
Your delta position should be the same as your notional position.


I will let you know about the CSU strike in deal entry.

Heather

I will be holding an information session on the midyear PRC process.  The purpose of the information session is to provide an overview of the PRC process from selecting reviewers to final PRC meetings in Houston.  New employees may find it useful as I will try to explain how the process works and will attempt to provide some useful background.  People who have been here for a while may also find it useful.  This year I am on the company-wide Performance Review Committee, so I have had the opportunity to provide input into the process and sit in on PRC meetings throughout the company.  I will discuss changes to this year's PRC process and share my observations of how the system works throughout the company.  Most importantly, I want to answer any questions that people have about the PRC process.

Date:  Wednesday, August 8
Time:  2:00 p.m.
Place:  Mt. Hood
Subject:  PRC Process

Let me or Debra know if you have any questions.

Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.

We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap.  Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.  Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.

Thank you for your patience.

BEWARE -

Effective today, we will be taking over BOTH - not just the standard ONE - phone lines for El Paso during off peak hours and on weekends. This means we'll get calls that would previously have been directed to Roger and Steve's cell phones. All calls will still ring in on the EL PASO line. Please read the e-mail in Lotus Notes titled "EPE MARKETING AVAILABILITY" for details. 

And let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate

The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures in excess of $5,000 has enabled Enron Americas to better assess the business value of events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.  

EA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this memo.

The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to $500, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.

Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.

1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events with anticipated costs in excess of $500 must be reviewed by the Enron Americas Public Relations department and approved by the Enron Americas Office of the Chairman
2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and EA.
3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the form.
4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the EA Office of the Chairman for final approval.

Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for various local sporting events and concerts.

If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.

Thank you for your cooperation.

All,


The viewing of the All Employee Meeting today was not a complete success despite our successful testing yesterday. There were several IT teams (your local IT Support as well as Houston based Web and Network teams) that worked together to troubleshoot the audio and video feeds while watching the performance of your sites communication links with Houston to ensure your trading business was not compromised. I would like to provide you some history as well as go forward actions to provide better audio/video streaming services.

You may have noticed that the medium for viewing the meeting has changed from the previous IPTV application to a web based application. This new medium has been in the development stages with the production target of October 2001 which was set by business. Last Friday business approached IT infrastructure and advised that there would be an All Employee Meeting on Aug, 16 (today). This didn't provide much time for preparation and testing. During the troubleshooting for each of your sites, the Network team (Scott Shishido and George Nguyen) were able to determine some but not all causes to the poor performance. I will be meeting with the Web (Edward Ray) and Network (Steve Hardy and Scott Shishido) teams to determine what the action plan is for resolving the performance issues.

My understanding is that the meeting will be available for viewing if you wish to do so. I will be communicating to you when your site will be able to view this replay of the All Employee Meeting.

Please contact me if you have any questions or concerns.


Regards,

Dan Dietrich

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

Good Afternoon Folks

I am sure this will come up in a month or so. 

We bought 20 mw from Mirant at 4 Corners for 9/27 and 9/28.  Mirant cut the schedule for 9/28 because they could not get transmission.  We are accepting this cut. We re-supplied our downstream and no LD's are to be billed per Mark and Holden.

I changed the volume to Zero in scheduling, and wrote a note there.

Lemmie know if there is trouble with this.

Also note - because these deals are being confirmed using the information supplied in Deal Entry, they must be correct in Deal Entry as well as scheduling.

Kate:  you might want to also tell the hourly desk if they change something on one of these deals in scheduling they also have to change it in deal entry or the confirm will be wrong and we will get phone calls from the customer.

Thanks,
Melissa

Subject:	Real Time Confirms - PLEASE READ

Real Time deals typically don't get confirmed; however, Chris Foster's generation customers have requested that we confirm their deals, whether day-ahead or hour-ahead.

For us, this means we need to pay special attention to the box marked "Confirmation" when entering deals. I know you're all in the habit of marking "No" under this designation, so review the following counterparty names carefully and commit them to memory, because deals with these generators NEED TO BE CONFIRMED. 

	Harbor Cogeneration
	Delano Energy
	Atlantic Richfield Co.
	Sierra Forest Products
	Wheelabrator Martell
	Wheelabrator Shasta
	Sierra Pacific Holding Co.
	Gas Recovery Systems
	East Bay MUD

Attached is a list of these counterparty names and corresponding contact information. Feel free to print this out and keep it in a nearby notebook.

Please let Chris or me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

FYI--

The information below is an excellent overview of the procedures our administrative personnel will be using when handling and distributing your mail into mail folders.  However, all administrative personnel in the Portland Enron WTC offices have received a hard copy of the guidelines and procedures issued by Oregon Department Administrative Services.  This four-page document has detailed guidelines and instructions for mail/parcel handling.  If you would like to get a copy of these guidelines, ask your administrative assistant or you can contact Debra Davidson to get a copy.  The World Trade Center Mailroom has informed Debra that they are also screening mail for lumps, powdery substances, unusual written comments on envelopes, etc.  If they detect a suspicious piece of mail or package addressed to our office, they will notify us as well as the proper authorities.

If you have any questions or concerns, please see me or Debra Davidson.

Subject:	Anthrax and other Biological Agent Threats

We understand that the recent cases of Anthrax contamination and the possibility that biological agents such as Anthrax may be used in a terrorist attack are raising great concerns among Enron employees.  Many government and commercial facilities in the United States have already received Anthrax threat letters containing powdery substances.  Most of these have, however, been determined to be false alarms.  We have no reason to believe that Enron has been or will be the target of an Anthrax attack, but we want to provide all employees with background information on Anthrax and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

If you have additional questions or concerns, please contact Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.

The most important thing to remember is:  Do not panic.  To infect someone, the Anthrax organism must be rubbed into abraded skin, swallowed, or inhaled as a fine, aerosolized mist.  Infection can be prevented after exposure to Anthrax by early treatment with the appropriate antibiotics.  Anthrax cannot be spread from one person to another.

Following are guidelines for identifying and dealing with suspicious letters or packages:

What constitutes a suspicious letter or parcel?  (Remember, these are only guidelines.  Use your best judgment when determining if a letter or package is suspicious.)

--  It is marked with the word "Anthrax."
--  It has a non-identifiable powdery substance on the outside.
--  It is unexpected or from someone unfamiliar to you.
--  Is addressed to someone no longer with your organization or is otherwise outdated.
--  Has no return address, or has one that cannot be verified as legitimate.
--  Is of unusual weight, given its size, or is lopsided or oddly shaped.
--  Has an unusual amount of tape on it.
--  Is marked with restrictive endorsements such as "personal" or "confidential".
--  Has a strange odor or stain.
--  Shows a city or country in the postmark that does not match the return address.

What do I do if I receive such a letter or package that I believe contains Anthrax?
--  Do not shake or empty the contents of any suspicious envelope or package.
--  Place the envelope or package in a plastic bag or some other type of container to prevent leakage of contents.
--  If you do not have any container, then cover the envelope or package with anything (e.g., clothing, paper, trash can, etc.) and do not remove this cover.
--  Leave the room and close the door, or section off the area to prevent others from entering (i.e., keep others away). 
-- Wash your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder to your face.
--  Notify your local building security official or an available supervisor.  Have them call 911 to alert the local police authorities.
--  List all people who were in the room or area when this suspicious letter or package was recognized. Give this list to both the local public health authorities and law enforcement officials for follow-up investigations and advice.  
If you open an envelope or package and a suspicious powder spills out:
--  Do not try to clean up the powder.  Cover the spilled contents immediately with anything (e.g., clothing, paper, trash can, etc.) and do not remove this cover! 
--  Leave the room and close the door, or section off the area to prevent others from entering (i.e., keep others away).
--  Wash your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder to your face.  Report the incident to your local building security official or an available supervisor.  Have them call 911 to alert the local police authorities. 
--  Remove heavily contaminated clothing as soon as possible and place in a plastic bag, or some other container that can be sealed.  This clothing bag should be given to the emergency responders for proper handling. 
--  Shower with soap and water as soon as possible.  Do not use bleach or other disinfectant on your skin. 
--  If possible, list all people who were in the room or area, especially those who had actual contact with the powder. Give this list to both the local public health authorities so that proper instructions can be given for medical follow-up, and to law enforcement officials for further investigation.

Holden & Lisa -

I'm forwarding this message from Settlements in Houston to give you an idea of what they need regarding your EPE marketing deals from the end of May, beginning of June. Can we send Amy something outlining your service fee so she can give Kathy an invoice with all the relevant information? I'd like your help on this so I don't misrepresent what was done. Let me know when you get a free moment.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate - I need to provide Kathy more info. on the buy/resale deals that we have in EnPower for June, but not on the model.  This is the invoice I am sending her ( attached below ).  She needs to know who it was bought from, rate, and if there is a service fee.

I gave her all the info. I see - but that doesn't seem to help her.  Can you help me find what she needs.  

Also, on these buy/resale deals.  I need to know at the first of the month that these deals are there.  Otherwise, Kathy never has them in her checkouts with me; thus I see them as something we have in EnPower, not in the model, and not in El Paso's numbers.  I then research them and put them in DMS.  Then later find out they needed to be checked out on and included in our invoice.  These deals are too after the fact; so we need some system that yall let me know they are there.

Thanks
Amy

If this is for transmission I need to know who it was bought from and at
what rate and also if there was a service fee attached to it.

The breakout on the invoice doesn't give any detail useful to me.

How well do you know our Code of Ethics?

"It is a condition of employment that each employee accept the responsibility of complying with the foregoing policies.  The Company will require each employee of the Company to complete and submit a statement in a form designated by the Company pertaining to such employee's compliance with the policies set forth in this booklet.  The Company reserves the right to request any employee to complete and submit such statement at any time or as frequently as the Company may deem advisable."
(Enron Code of Ethics, July 2000, page 62)

What does that mean?

In layman's terms, everyone employed by Enron agrees to all the policies and standards listed in the current Code of Ethics (July 2000).

Who does it apply to?

The Code of Ethics applies to all employees, third party contractors, guests and licensees of Enron.  Additionally, employees are responsible for their family members and/or personal household who use, own, or have access to Enron's communication services and equipment -- including telephones, fax machines, computers, computer modems, long distance telephone services, cell phones, voice mail, pagers, e-mail, mail and delivery services.

What about my privacy?

Don't expect privacy when using Enron's equipment or services -- whether the activity is business or non-business related.  For example, don't use Enron's equipment to send or receive personal messages that you don't want monitored or accessed by the government, third parties or Enron.  In a nutshell, if you want privacy, don't use Enron's equipment.

Are there repercussions for non-compliance?

Yes.  An employee who violates any of the policies in the Code of Ethics is subject to disciplinary action, including suspension or termination of employment, and can include legal action if Enron believes it to be appropriate under the circumstances.

With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


UBSWenergy Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).		

Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Japan
Enron Japan Closes Its First Yen Based Dubai Crude Oil Swap (11 Oct)
This groundbreaking deal involved Enron Japan purchasing 12,500 barrels of =
Yen-priced March Dubai swaps from Japanese trading house, Kobayashi Yoko. E=
nron Japan purchased the Dubai swaps (Dubai being the marker crude oil in t=
he Asian region) in US$ from Enron Singapore and hedged out the FX risk int=
ernally, offering the customer a yen-based product which best suited its re=
quirements.

This deal highlights the large and (as yet) untapped demand amongst Japanes=
e trading houses and end users for oil risk management products. During the=
 5 months since Enron Japan started its crude and product marketing activit=
ies, it has developed relationships with numerous customers that are lookin=

IN THE NEWS

In these challenging times, Enron deserves our thanks=20
Houston Chronicle, October 28, 2001  By BILL WHITE=20
Enron and its employees have blessed Houston, and many Houstonians should n=
ow take the time to say "thanks" when the company has experienced some high=
ly publicized challenges. Enron attracted thousands of great people to Hous=
ton and changed Houston's economy forever. The company's management encoura=
ged their employees to be active citizens, and those folks responded by mak=
ing a big difference in their community.=20

Enron's lead in shaping a nationwide market for electricity gave birth to a=
 multibillion-dollar new industry, with Houston as its hub. Even while it c=
ompeted hard to win in the marketplace, Enron's example helped show other n=
atural gas pipeline and trading firms how to move into the even bigger mark=
et of electricity

This explosive growth attracted bright young people -- and they in turn hel=
ped fuel an explosion in residential growth in Houston's downtown. This, in=
 turn, helped revitalize downtown's retail and restaurant scene. Enron's co=
nstruction of a large Class A office tower, still going up, is a milestone =
in Houston's growth, an official end to more than a decade of large amounts=
 of vacant office space.=20

Enron's corporate success reflects the stories of so many of its employees =
who have lived the American dream. Enron rewarded innovation, while many fi=
rms afraid to alter the old formula wondered why their leadership eroded. Y=
ear after year, top executives throughout the country voted Enron our natio=
n's most innovative corporation. Enron recognized, even when financial mark=
ets do not, that innovative firms are secure enough to accept occasional fa=
ilure and the inevitable price of other successes.=20

And so if Enron experiences problems, it will learn from them, just as stro=
ng people do. Let's not prejudge Enron's current challenges. The more than =
a decade of my life that was dedicated to trying cases against companies wh=
o hurt consumers and investors taught me both to insist on the truth but ne=
ver to jump to premature conclusions based on a headline or a news story.=
=20
Throughout its years of success, Enron folks have never forgotten to find s=
o many ways to make the firm's hometown of Houston a better place to live a=
nd work. As Enron enters a new phase of its life, let's not forget to expre=
ss thanks and steady support.=20

NUGGETS & NOTES

Portland Bikes to Work
In September, the Portland Office participated in the 2001 OREGON BIKE COMM=
UTE CHALLENGE sponsored by the Bicycle Transportation Alliance (BTA).  BTA =
is a non-profit organization working to promote bicycle use and to improve =
bicycling conditions throughout the state of Oregon. More than 185 business=
es and public agencies across the state and SW Washington registered for th=
e competition to see which among them could tally the most bike commutes ov=
er the course of the month.  Within our category of companies (100-400 empl=
oyees), Enron came in first place with a total of 21% office ridership.  Th=
is was a terrific turnout (second place was under 13% ridership).  The Enro=
n participants had a blast - we broke into teams to challenge each other wi=
th total miles and total trips.  A website was created for our teams to tra=
ck the number of trips and watch the competition.  Overall, Enron participa=
nts completed 1113 commutes for a total distance of 4645 miles, saving 258 =
gallons of gasoline.  Bicycling Magazine recently named Portland "Best Bicy=
cling City in North America".  Many thanks to Heather Dunton for leading En=
ron's participation.

As we discussed during our September 7 meeting, attached is a matrix
showing the 10 Northwest Aluminum Direct Service Industries (DSI's).
Since the curtailment agreements BPA has with Alcoa and Columbia Falls
are confidential, am not privy to all their terms. However, I think the
overall status is pretty accurate.

We can use this chart in our October 8 meeting to discuss possible DSI
candidates for Enron services. Please let me know if you need any more
information.

I would like to talk to you about the Rockies, and just how you see it progressing.  I need to do some workload mitigation stuff, and wanted to pick your brain this afternoon if I can.

I am starting Susie taking care of Midway as of tomorrow, and am thinking about moving the Mead responsiblities to the COB scheduler because COB is so small.

Holden,

Can you look at this deal, 602737.1.  It's not comming through on the CARP report even after I schedule it and PNM is wondering why. 

 Also, a purchase for $58 27 mw's isn't in the system and they are seeing it.

I'm not sure how Parking and lending deals are entered in the system, but somthing looks out of wack

Subject:        Request for Proposals - PacifiCorp Eastern Control Area 



The regulated merchant arm of PacifiCorp is requesting proposals from entities who are capable of supplying electric resources delivered to PacifiCorp's Eastern electrical control area.  Responses to this Request for Proposals ("RFP") are due prior to 2:00 p.m. Pacific prevailing time on October 19, 2001.  Both supply-side and demand-side resources capable of being scheduled for delivery on a day-ahead and/or hour-ahead basis are welcome to bid and those resources capable of accepting schedule changes during the day and/or hour of delivery will be ascribed the highest value.  Resources not capable of being scheduled for delivery in advance are welcome to bid under this RFP, however, they will not be valued the same as resources capable of meeting their pre-scheduled amount with a high level of consistency. In addition, resources that are capable of providing either the spinning or non-spinning component of operating reserves are also encouraged to bid under this RFP. 

Please review the RFP carefully.  Your proposal will be considered separate from any existing wholesale purchase, electric service or DSM agreements you currently have in place with PacifiCorp. Entities bidding must have either FERC status for resource delivery or be capable of delivering resources under existing regulated restrictions and appropriate retail tariffs.  PacifiCorp intends to pursue definitive agreements with entities that provide PacifiCorp with the best combination of resource characteristics and evaluated resource costs, including credit risk factors.

The RFP provides a contact number for questions and shows a schedule for submittal.  Please note that a Notice of Intent to Propose form must be returned by October 1st in order to bid. There will be a pre-bid conference scheduled in early October.  We look forward to your interest and proposals.  If you still have additional questions, do not hesitate to contact Lisa Lynch, Project Management Office at (503) 813-5669.

Last week was the hardest week that our office has ever experienced.  When I look down the list of people who were laid off I see the names of some very talented people.  Things have unfolded so quickly -- the reality of the situation is settling in for me, and probably many of us, today.  

Again, I wanted to express my thanks and gratitude to everyone on our floor -- both current and former employees.  In the interest of keeping people informed about who is here and who is gone, below is a complete list of layoffs done last week within the west power team.

This e-mail is to confirm what we discussed and decided at today's trading meeting.  Going forward, we are splitting the fundies meeting into two parts.  The first part will be from about 1 until 1:30 with Tim H. reviewing all of the routine fundamental slides.  The second part of the meeting will include only the people on this e-mail.  During that part of the meeting, which will run from approximately 1:30 until 2:30, we will discuss specific trading matters.

If there is anyone who works for you that has been going to the fundies meeting but will not be attending the smaller trading meeting please let them know about the new approach.  We remain committed to sharing the fundies information with a broad group people while trying to create a time and place where the smaller trading team can talk through trading issues.

Thanks,
Tim

There is a computer virus currently infecting the Houston office that is very serious.  If for any reason, your system shuts off and reboots itself, don't do anything to the computer and come and get one of us in IT.

Thank you for your cooperation

You might ask Sean or Diana.  See what they think.. I know of the schedulers  Dave and Bonnie, but I don't think they will be much help.

The deal was done between Mark and Janice at SRP.  I heard him make the call.  Also, do you have any more avenues with PAC tranny like a supervisor or something.  I am not really in a position to negotiate with anyone.  They all claim that they can't change the Oasis system.
