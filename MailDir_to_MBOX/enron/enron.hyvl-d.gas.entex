Wes - I spoke with Barbara Gray in Legal last night.  Unless Entex consents, 
the Entex contract can only be assigned to an Enron affiliate.  However, 
Barbara thinks we can assign this contract (plus any other on-system ENA 
sales contracts) to an Enron affiliate, then sell this affiliate along with 
HPL stock to the buyer.  Barbara or Dan, if there are major impediments to 
this strategy, please let me know.

regards,
Patrick

Brenda,

Can you send me a copy of Bruce's response.  Also, we need to meet on Entex 
this week as you suggest.  In my discussions with Bruce, he feels that Entex 
can account for all of their gas nominations/takes - and that these 
nominations are not related to intra-month price volatility.

We discussed having an initial meeting next week.  Then, if it makes sense, I 
think we should involve MidCon in the discussions as their imbalances seem to 
be a key factor in Entex changing their nominations.   These meetings would 
be to seek to develop a working protocol that we could use to improve 
communication and establish more definitive criteria for changing 
nominations.  

The end game would be a final meeting with Entex senior management to agree a 
solution to past sins and a way forward.

Brian

Brenda,

Matthew reviewed Coogler's responses and brings up the following questions.

We can do one-of-two things at this point.  We can either add the Reliant
responses to our audit report as "Auditee Responses", or we can have Enron
provide answers and possibly have us do some additional work.  The additional
work is dependent on Enron's answers to the questions.

Please advise.

Rick and Fred:

I hope things are going well up in Salt Lake City.  I have gone through all of
Bruce's numbers today.  I have come up with a few questions that Enron needs 
to
answer.

1. Reliant claims that in East Texas the cut off for complementary customers 
is
30 Mcf/ day,  does Enron agree?
2. Reliant claims that the "New Technology Contract" overrides  or is an
exception to the Enfolio Master Agreement.  Does Enron agree that this is a
legitimate exception?
3. Reliant claims that all off the industrial mis-classified gas in the 
Houston
Division is under "special contracts" with special pricing, and even though 
they
are using less than 100 Mcf /day they receive a lower price of 2.71 per MMBTU.
Does Enron agree that this is a legitimate exception?
4. In the Houston Division it appears that Louisiana Pacific only uses gas for
heating in the winter, about three months out of the year.  Is there total
divided by three to find their average usage, or is it divided by 12?  Bruce
divided by three, we divided by twelve.  They are a customer all year, and are
not a new customer, or a customer that has left.
5. Does Enron want to give Reliant leeway on the 100 Mcf rule?  What will the
actual cut off be?  Bruce backs out 137,000 Mcf that was close, but not quite
100 Mcf.

These are the issues that I see.  The first three questions are things that
Enron may have to ask Bracewell and Patterson.  We were not notified of any of
the special contracts that he mentions.  Let me know what I need to do.  If 
you
guys have questions for me, it might be easier if we all got on the phone and
spoke about it.  Thanks,

Matthew

Barbara,
I had a chance to look at this again and I have left a note for Dan (he 
wasn't in his office) indicating that if by "I think we should involve MidCon 
in the discussions" Brian intends a joint meeting among ENA, MidCon and Entex 
to discuss the correction fo nomination irregularities, I think that's an 
acceptable proposal.  If, however, Brian intends a private meeting between 
MidCon and ENA to discuss our respective contractual obligations to Entex, 
then I think Dan needs fo advise Brian of the risks attendant to such a 
meeting.  

Do you agree?

 Please see Brian Redmond note to Brenda below regarding meeting with MidCon 
to talk about their imbalances with Reliant Energy.  This could possible open 
both parties up to a torturous interference argument with Reliant Energy.  Do 
you agree?  If so, we need to nix meeting idea.

I visited with Mr. Bruce Lilly, Foreman for the San Jacinto River Authority, 
yesterday to discuss the possibility of HPL leaving the 2" NGO pipeline on 
the wooden supports that cross the San Jacinto River Authority's fresh water 
canal behind the NGO  plant.  Mr. Lilly's response to my request was no, the 
River Authority will not agree to allow the wooden supports to remain under 
any circumstance.  The River Authority believes the existing crossing is a 
hindrance to their operation and maintenance of the canal and they want it 
removed.  ExxonMobil's design for the new concrete crossing allows the River 
Authority to operate and maintain the canal with fewer obstacles.

You asked me the term of OxyChem's Natural Gas Odorizer's committment to 
Entex.  I don't know the answer - I'll have to contact OxyChem to find out.  
But I'm not ready to do that yet - I don't want to stir the waters until we 
have more information on this line relocation.  I would rather Entex 
contacted NGO first, once we have figured out what we will do.  Does anybody 
know the term and nature of HPL's committment to Entex with respect to NGO?

Whats the load to NGO?  If, as I now am finding out, it is apparently 
insignificant and we find that we have very few rights to claim a) 
compensation or b) staying where we are versus moving at our cost then maybe 
we just dont continue service.  John is working on the ROW issues and we'll 
soon get more educated.

Subject: Re: Natural Gas Odorizers - Baytown feed to Entex

Too much missing information!  For what reason is Exxon installing a new pipe 
support structure across the San Jacinto Water Canal?  Is it in poor 
condition and needs to be replaced, thus mandating our need to move?  Is the 
Water Authority requiring the move and why?  Is the existing structure going 
to stay and is that acceptable to the Water Authority and Exxon?  Will Exxon 
allow us to remain in the same location even though they are building a new 
structure?  What is the condition of our pipe on the existing rack?  Don't we 
already have a permit with the Water Authority for the existing pipeline?  Is 
the Water Authority a City of Baytown organization and therefore falls within 
the City's control on franchise permits, fees, issues, etc?  

Once you have the answers to the above questions, then get us together so we 
can formulate a plan.  Lee, what is the existing term of their commitment to 
Entex?  Is Oxy OK with a short term shut down to get all this connected once 
in place or do they need continuing operations?  Due to the time constraints 
on replacement, we need quick answers.  Brad, you are on point to quickly 
pull this together.

I have spoke to both Tom Shelton and Dan Hyvl about the franchise tax 
situation with the city of Baytown.  Tom referred me to Dan.  Dan said that 
as long as HPL does not need to get a permit from the City of Baytown to 
either cross a public road or to cross the San Jacinto Water Authority water 
canal, then we would be okay.  I do not believe that any relocation will 
involve a new road crossing, and if it turns out that we need to get a permit 
from the City of Baytown to cross the water canal, then we should ask either 
Exxon or Entex to get that permit.  If we plan to take this NGO business from 
Entex, then we need to work with Exxon.  Exxon did offer to construct HPL's 
2" line across the new bridge.  If HPL is going to replace the line, then we 
might take Exxon up on this offer since they would have to get all the 
permits for this work.  Those permits would, of course, need to be 
transferrable to the owner and operator of the pipeline, which, in the end, 
would be HPL.

FYI - Natural Gas Odorizers is wholly owned by OxyChem, a large industrial 
customer (over 100,000/d total in Texas) with several plants that HPL serves 
(I am the OxyChem rep).  Two years ago, OxyChem tried very hard to get HPL to 
connect to them directly and cut out Entex, but we did not do it because of 
the franchise tax issue.  The last OxyChem rep was fairly p.o.'d about us not 
connecting.

So, we would score lots of points with OxyChem (as in, more business at the 
large volume plants) if we could connect directly to them,  What's our next 
step?

Please include me in any meetings

Subject: Natural Gas Odorizers - Baytown feed to Entex

We should seriously question why HPL should pay for the relocation of the NGO 
line as referenced in the report attached.  Entex gets the full benefit of 
this customer and probably should fund this project.  If they won't, then 
maybe we should pursue this customer direct while we are in the progress of 
replacing the pipeline.  We probably also have franchise related issues with 
the City of Baytown on this.  Tom, please determine what course of action we 
need to take from a franchise perspective.  Then call a meeting of the above 
group along with Blevins and Ducote (if appropriate).

We have now been informed by the accounting gurus that  we can go ahead and 
transfer the Entex contract to the purchaser of HPL and not have to undo the 
marked to market position.  As a result, we will transfer the Entex contract 
as well as the other contracts which cannot be in HPL to a new Enron and sell 
the stock in the new sub along with the HPL stock.  There will be no need 
for  a back to back contract.  However, we will need to unwind the cash 
monetization transactions involving the Entex contract, as well as the one 
involving the Union Carbide contract. (there may be others and we are 
checking on them now.)

Dan, since you are the guru of these unwindings and whether there are others 
which need to be unwound I am forwarding this to you.  Dan, also please let 
me know what Ducote has accomplished with Entex

I wanted to update each of you on a number of matters:

1.  On Tuesday of next week we plan to give copies of the Proposed Stock 
Purchase Agreement and Lease (sublease) to the interested bidders.  The first 
data room visits are scheduled to occur on Thursday the seventh.   Chris is 
going to circulate a revised draft of the Stock Purchase Agreement to 
everyone later today and everyone on the Enron team should have their 
comments to me by Friday evening.  

2.  With respect to the lease, in response to David's inquiry regarding 
section 3.06, I think we should leave in all the parts of 3.06.  With respect 
to subpart (v) would it be possible to leave it in but just handle the issue 
of title etc as a rep.  Also, I would like to add a change of control 
provision to the Lease and provide for a parent guarantee from an entity with 
a credit rating acceptable to Enron.  I have yet to receive AnnMarie's 
comments and questions, but I think you should go ahead and generate a new 
draft for distribution Friday and AnnMarie will have the opportunity to 
comment on the revised draft.  I would ask that the revised lease be reviewed 
by Trina Chandler and Ed Osterberg as well.  Gail, please give me a call and 
we can coordinate getting the revised draft lease to the appropriate 
parties.  

3. With respect to the unwind descriptions and the right to use agreement, I 
would appreciate an update and an estimate on when the unwind descriptions 
and a draft of the exclusive Right to Use agreement would be available.

4.  We have now been informed by the accounting gurus that  we can go ahead 
and transfer the Entex contract to the purchaser of HPL and not have to undo 
the marked to market position.  As a result, we will transfer the Entex 
contract as well as the other contracts which cannot be in HPL to a new Enron 
and sell the stock in the new sub along with the HPL stock.  There will be no 
need for  a back to back contract.  However, we will need to unwind the cash 
monetization transactions involving the Entex contract, as well as the one 
involving the Union Carbide contract. (there may be others and we are 
checking on them now.)

That is all for now.  I will keep you posted as things develop (and change!).

Dan, 
Per my earlier conversation here are the details.

The original contracts are 078-27105-302 (NGMS & Entex) and 058-27105-301 
(HPLC Mktg & Entex) .  The NGMS contract in Section 8 allows 1 year to 
recover volume changes and the HPLC Mktg contract in Section 8 allows 2 years 
to recover volume changes.  Per our conversation today, the contract 
provisions override the state law and Entex should not be invoiced the 
additional volumes.

Janet, since we cannot rebill Entex do you still want us to reallocate and 
then write off the dollar amounts.
This would enable us to be in sync from a physical volume side.   Please let 
me know.

Howard, I believe the contract reads that we have up to 2 years to re-invoice 
so could you explain the 4 year Statute of Limitations.  I am not familiar 
with it and if we do have a legal right that overrides the contract then we 
should explore this option.

Also,  what is the standard operation procedure?  Are we reconciling the 
entire system and re-invoicing everyone whether it is for or against the 
pipeline?

Subject: Entex 1997

Janet,
Here is short note to update you on the questions you had on 1997.

This came about due to a project that Volume Management is working on for 
Brenda Herrod in reconciling the 1996-1998 Unaccounted For.

In comparing the measurement volumes at the various meters that make up the 
aggregate meter 2000, it was discovered that some of the measurement volumes 
had changed.  The Entex analysis  has been done for 1998 and had one 
adjustment for June 1998 of 14,660 additional invoiced to Entex.  The 1997 
analysis was done within the last month and this is when the discrepancies 
were found.  I have done a preliminary analysis for 1996 and the only 
material volume appears to be in April 1996 of 8,296 additional volume 
needing to be invoiced to Entex.  The 1996 will be completed by Mid March. 

I sent Ami the 1997 analysis to ask her how she wanted to address the issue 
of whether or not you wanted to go back to Entex.    

The Statute of Limitations is 4 years, so both the 1996 and 1997 adjustments 
would fall within this timeframe.

Please contact me if there are any other questions or issues.
HC

As we discussed.  

I am not sure what my new e-mail address is going to be - during the AEP

as soon as I get it fixed.  In the meantime, if you send out paper would you

Location: Clark meter 1511
Date:  June 2001
Volume: 5,000 a day
Price:  HSC -.015
Final price with swap pay out of 208,875 equates to:

HSC minus   -  .015 (location diff)
  -1.3925 (swap value)
  
  -1.4075

HSC minus $1.4075 = final price.  


Ed, would you please put this in your system, I won't do a deal ticket for 
obvious reasons. Greg, you will need to get with legal to get a contract to 
Entex.  We do have an Enfolio in place.

Thanks all,
Janet

them and use those as the guidelines.  Well, she noticed that he had crossed 
out some stuff on the Entex master that he or some other attorney had agreed 
to previously on another Master we have with them.  She said she would finish 
reviewing the Entex Master and coordinate the contract with Maggie Ortiz in 
our Contracts Administration group.  Maggie and Theresa have established some 
communications and I thought I'd let our contract group work with theirs.

I will be out of the office the next two weeks.  If you have any questions, 
please speak with Maggie or Julie Meyers.  Julie is now handling all Texas 
business.

thanx

Janet,
 I agree with Kyle, however, Ducote indicated that Bruce told him that they 
wanted it in Entex Gas Marketing Company.  They sent us draft paper for a 
spot gisb, however, we don't normally put long term firm under the gisb so, I 
redrafted the transactions under the Master Firm Purchase Sale agreement 
which they are reviewing.  I recall that Joe Casas called me to say that 
Entex had some comments concerning the fact that they did not record phone 
conversations and only wanted us to record the portion of a call that was 
specific to a deal.  So far, I have not received those comments from Joe.

Dan, Is Entex Gas Marketing correct?  Ducote said to refer to the GISBY 
contracts for the proper name (which you may have done).

Janet,

 Can you let me know what you find out regarding that $1 million dollar pmt 
to Entex for extending the deal?  The Transaction Agreement #4 & 5, the 
buy/sell, nets out to the $1million due Entex.  Since this payment is for 
extending the deal,  shouldn't the Transaction Agreement  be between ECT & 
Reliant Energy - Entex and not Entex Gas Marketing? I will be out this 
afternoon, so could you just email me?

Thanks,
Kyle

Ami,

As discussed earlier, the issue is whether all of the Delivery Points 
appearing on Exhibit C to the 76 Agreement, as amended, are subject to the 
audit of General Service Customers, or whether the audit should narrow the 
focus to the Houston, East Texas and Gulf Coast Divisions.  Stated 
differently, the issue is whether quantities of gas required by General 
Service Customers in the Beaumont Division or the South Texas Division should 
be considered part of the Basket.

Transaction No. 1 - Revision No. 1 under the ENFOLIO Agreement states that 
the DCQ obligations apply  to "Customer's Houston, East Texas and Gulf Coast 
Divisions."  Therefore, although this Transaction identifies the Delivery 
Point(s) as those appearing on Exhibit C to the 76 Agreement, the intent was 
to exclude Beaumont and South Texas.  In an earlier conversation today, Dan 
Hyvl confirmed that the foregoing was the appropriate analysis of this 
Transaction.

Based on this call, it would appear that, although Exhibit C to the 76 
Agreement lists multiple Delivery Points, the intent was to limit the 
Delivery Point to the Customer group referenced in the heading of the 
applicable ENFOLIO Agreement.

Dan further stated that the boundary lines were redrawn at some time prior to 
December 29, 1998 (the date of the Restructuring Agreement).  We have not 
seen documentation evidencing these changes.  In addition, it was discovered 
that the "Texas Coast Division" (referenced on Exhibit C, as amended) is 
actually the "Gulf Coast Division."  Dan mentioned that it would be prudent 
for all parties to outline definitive boundaries of divisions for future 
clarification.  Finally, he stated he would meet with you personally to 
discuss these issues with you further.

I hope you find this information useful.  If you have any questions or 
comments, please do not hesitate to call me or Aaron Roffwarg at (713) 
221-1117.

I need some further clarification.  As I understand it, some, if not all, of 
the meters that reside in Beaumont and South Texas Divisions are included in 
Exhibit C.  Are we saying that the "extend and blend" transaction excluded 
some volume previously included?  That is inconsistent with the analysis 
performed when the renegotiated transactions were analyzed and booked. 

I have asked Arhur Andersen for a copy of the amended Exhibit C so I can 
fully understand.  Maybe that will help clear my confusion also.

Dan, thanks for your submission of all the contracts, I've not been able to
devote all of my time to them, but they are in varying stages of
completion.  This will be a short week with the holiday, so I wanted to
touch base with you and let you know that we probably will not be able to
address these contract issues until the week of Nov. 27th.

I hope you have a safe and happy Thanksgiving.

I have been sitting on the amendment you drafted which was to add several 
city gates while removing others as part of the Rosenburg transition.  Since 
we cannot find economic support for the Pheasant Creek City Gate, please 
delete this from your draft (to be effective 10/1/99) and resubmit to me for 
execution.  Upon Entex's execution of the Bill of Sale on Rosenburg, which we 
have been waiting for their comments for several weeks, we will then be 
prepared to execute this revised amendment.  Jim, can you prompt up Entex's 
response to the Bill of Sale so we can move this along?

Yes. I believe that is correct. I will review the documents with regards to 
true assignment to a third party beyond assigning to an affiliate. But the 
transaction was structured to give Enron complete commercial flexibility with 
regards to restructuring or renegotiating the contracts. The sale is a bit 
more than a restructuring but the remedy is likely to be the same. Either 
Enron will retire the outstanding amounts under the monetization or give an 
indemnity for any losses associated with the transfer. The banks will likely 
accept either. Could you give me an idea of when the actual sale (cash 
changing hands) would likely take place. If we close with conditions 
precedent that are not likely to be met before 2001, I am less concerned 
about the negative funds flow issue of prepaying the financing. Regardless, I 
would imagine the outstanding amount under those contracts is getting quite 
small through five years of amortization. Thanks.

Subject: Monetized Contracts

Joe,
 Yesterday when we talked, I noted that Enron is considering selling certain 
pipeline and contract assets, certain of which contracts may have been 
previously monetized.  This is to confirm that the contracts which were 
monetized as a part of CASH II, being the contracts with Union Carbide, Texas 
Utilities Fuel Company and Southern Union Gas Company, and the two contracts 
with Entex, a division of Noram Energy Corp. (now Reliant Energy Entex, a 
division of Reliant Energy Resources Corp.) could, if necessary,  be assigned 
to an Enron subsidiary and that subsidiary could be sold to a third party 
without necessarily having to unwind the prior monetizations.  Please advise 
if this is not correct?  I will notify you with the specific contract 
information if these contracts are included in any sale to a non Enron entity.

 Assuming that the system btu reported annually is representive of the Btu of 
the gas being purchased, the procedure that you have set forth will work.  
The question is how is the system btu determined?  Is it a total recap of the 
measured mcfs including both purchase and transport?

Have you seen the fully-executed copy of the subject Agreement with Enron 
North America Corp.?
 It is not listed in the Tracking List.   I was faxed an unexecuted copy by 
Reliant.   I understand Reliant
now has received a fully-executed copy, but we do not have this contract set 
up in Global.    

Will  you track this down with Legal and route it to me for briefing, as I am 
handling all Reliant and
Entex related contracts.

Thank you

I have been sitting on the amendment you drafted which was to add several

we cannot find economic support for the Pheasant Creek City Gate, please 
delete this from your draft (to be effective 10/1/99) and resubmit to me for 
execution.  Upon Entex's execution of the Bill of Sale on Rosenburg, which we 
have been waiting for their comments for several weeks, we will then be 
prepared to execute this revised amendment.  Jim, can you prompt up Entex's 
response to the Bill of Sale so we can move this along?

Barbara,

Its pretty clear from Brian's message to Brenda Herod of 9/26 that he has had 
meetings with Entex's Bruce Coogler (or at least "discussions") and that he 
intends to have more meetings (perhaps this week). 

I would like to know if there is anything you want me to do about this matter 
or if I should pass your advice on to Dan Hyvl.  I haven't been involved in 
any Entex or regulatory advisory matters with Brian to this point, I simply 
received an e:mail from Dan asking for a second opinion.

Please let me know.

I don't think Brian, the President of HPL should be having any meetings with

person; similarly, we should not be asking for a meeting with Entex.  If 
ENTEX wants to schedule a joint meeting,it might be okay to 
attend............depending on the subject matter...........ANYTHING HAVING 
TO DO WITH PRICING SHOULD NOT BE DISCUSSED...........i BELIEVE MORE FACTS

I had a chance to look at this again and I have left a note for Dan (he 
wasn't in his office) indicating that if by "I think we should involve MidCon 
in the discussions" Brian intends a joint meeting among ENA, MidCon and Entex 
to discuss the correction fo nomination irregularities, I think that's an 
acceptable proposal.  If, however, Brian intends a private meeting between 
MidCon and ENA to discuss our respective contractual obligations to Entex, 
then I think Dan needs fo advise Brian of the risks attendant to such a 
meeting.  

Do you agree?

Brenda,

Can you send me a copy of Bruce's response.  Also, we need to meet on Entex 
this week as you suggest.  In my discussions with Bruce, he feels that Entex 
can account for all of their gas nominations/takes - and that these 
nominations are not related to intra-month price volatility.

We discussed having an initial meeting next week.  Then, if it makes sense, I 
think we should involve MidCon in the discussions as their imbalances seem to 
be a key factor in Entex changing their nominations.   These meetings would 
be to seek to develop a working protocol that we could use to improve 
communication and establish more definitive criteria for changing 
nominations.  

The end game would be a final meeting with Entex senior management to agree a 
solution to past sins and a way forward.

Brian

Brenda,

Matthew reviewed Coogler's responses and brings up the following questions.

We can do one-of-two things at this point.  We can either add the Reliant
responses to our audit report as "Auditee Responses", or we can have Enron
provide answers and possibly have us do some additional work.  The additional
work is dependent on Enron's answers to the questions.

Please advise.

Subject:  Coogler's Response

Rick and Fred:

I hope things are going well up in Salt Lake City.  I have gone through all of
Bruce's numbers today.  I have come up with a few questions that Enron needs 
to
answer.

1. Reliant claims that in East Texas the cut off for complementary customers 
is
30 Mcf/ day,  does Enron agree?
2. Reliant claims that the "New Technology Contract" overrides  or is an
exception to the Enfolio Master Agreement.  Does Enron agree that this is a
legitimate exception?
3. Reliant claims that all off the industrial mis-classified gas in the 
Houston
Division is under "special contracts" with special pricing, and even though 
they
are using less than 100 Mcf /day they receive a lower price of 2.71 per MMBTU.
Does Enron agree that this is a legitimate exception?
4. In the Houston Division it appears that Louisiana Pacific only uses gas for
heating in the winter, about three months out of the year.  Is there total
divided by three to find their average usage, or is it divided by 12?  Bruce
divided by three, we divided by twelve.  They are a customer all year, and are
not a new customer, or a customer that has left.
5. Does Enron want to give Reliant leeway on the 100 Mcf rule?  What will the
actual cut off be?  Bruce backs out 137,000 Mcf that was close, but not quite
100 Mcf.

These are the issues that I see.  The first three questions are things that
Enron may have to ask Bracewell and Patterson.  We were not notified of any of
the special contracts that he mentions.  Let me know what I need to do.  If 
you
guys have questions for me, it might be easier if we all got on the phone and
spoke about it.  Thanks,

Matthew

Ellen,
     I received your voice mail and your email this morning.  I made each
of the changes from your email to the two contract documents.  Please
review and if acceptable, please start the execution process by printing
two originals of each document.  Once signed by Reliant, please forward to
me and I will have ENA sign their contract and I will attempt to get
Enovate to sign and return their contract and the two transaction
agreements to me for forwarding one fully set to you.  Please call if you
have any questions.  My phone number is (713)853-6895.

I don't think Brian, the President of HPL should be having any meetings with 
Entex................if someone is to meet with Entex, it needs to be an ENA 
person; similarly, we should not be asking for a meeting with Entex.  If 
ENTEX wants to schedule a joint meeting,it might be okay to 
attend............depending on the subject matter...........ANYTHING HAVING 
TO DO WITH PRICING SHOULD NOT BE DISCUSSED...........i BELIEVE MORE FACTS 
NEED TO BE MARSHALLED.

Barbara,
I had a chance to look at this again and I have left a note for Dan (he 
wasn't in his office) indicating that if by "I think we should involve MidCon 
in the discussions" Brian intends a joint meeting among ENA, MidCon and Entex 
to discuss the correction fo nomination irregularities, I think that's an 
acceptable proposal.  If, however, Brian intends a private meeting between 
MidCon and ENA to discuss our respective contractual obligations to Entex, 
then I think Dan needs fo advise Brian of the risks attendant to such a 
meeting.  

Do you agree?

 Please see Brian Redmond note to Brenda below regarding meeting with MidCon 
to talk about their imbalances with Reliant Energy.  This could possible open 
both parties up to a torturous interference argument with Reliant Energy.  Do

Brenda,

Can you send me a copy of Bruce's response.  Also, we need to meet on Entex 
this week as you suggest.  In my discussions with Bruce, he feels that Entex 
can account for all of their gas nominations/takes - and that these 
nominations are not related to intra-month price volatility.

We discussed having an initial meeting next week.  Then, if it makes sense, I 
think we should involve MidCon in the discussions as their imbalances seem to 
be a key factor in Entex changing their nominations.   These meetings would 
be to seek to develop a working protocol that we could use to improve 
communication and establish more definitive criteria for changing 
nominations.  

The end game would be a final meeting with Entex senior management to agree a 
solution to past sins and a way forward.

Brian

Brenda,

Matthew reviewed Coogler's responses and brings up the following questions.

We can do one-of-two things at this point.  We can either add the Reliant
responses to our audit report as "Auditee Responses", or we can have Enron
provide answers and possibly have us do some additional work.  The additional
work is dependent on Enron's answers to the questions.

Please advise.

Subject:  Coogler's Response

Rick and Fred:

I hope things are going well up in Salt Lake City.  I have gone through all of
Bruce's numbers today.  I have come up with a few questions that Enron needs 
to
answer.

1. Reliant claims that in East Texas the cut off for complementary customers 
is
30 Mcf/ day,  does Enron agree?
2. Reliant claims that the "New Technology Contract" overrides  or is an
exception to the Enfolio Master Agreement.  Does Enron agree that this is a
legitimate exception?
3. Reliant claims that all off the industrial mis-classified gas in the 
Houston
Division is under "special contracts" with special pricing, and even though 
they
are using less than 100 Mcf /day they receive a lower price of 2.71 per MMBTU.
Does Enron agree that this is a legitimate exception?
4. In the Houston Division it appears that Louisiana Pacific only uses gas for
heating in the winter, about three months out of the year.  Is there total
divided by three to find their average usage, or is it divided by 12?  Bruce
divided by three, we divided by twelve.  They are a customer all year, and are
not a new customer, or a customer that has left.
5. Does Enron want to give Reliant leeway on the 100 Mcf rule?  What will the
actual cut off be?  Bruce backs out 137,000 Mcf that was close, but not quite
100 Mcf.

These are the issues that I see.  The first three questions are things that
Enron may have to ask Bracewell and Patterson.  We were not notified of any of
the special contracts that he mentions.  Let me know what I need to do.  If 
you
guys have questions for me, it might be easier if we all got on the phone and
spoke about it.  Thanks,

Matthew

I have submitted essentially the same edits to your contract that were

review these changes and call me with any questions or concerns.  Stacy
Dickson was kind enough to offer her assistance as well.

You may reach me at (713)207-3266 with any questions or concerns.  I look

Hi Dan:

Just an update to let you know the status of the agreements between Reliant
and Enovate and Enron.  They are both being routed internally prior to
execution.  However, due to the "Notices" section missing from the Enovate
contract, Legal has asked that I forward that to you for execution prior to
Reliant's execution.  I hope that this is not a problem.

Dan, I don't want this contract to get misdirected, Enron's so large and
that could easily happen.  Could you please send me your direct mailing
address so that I may send it directly to you for your further handling?
Thanks, I appreciate so much your help in getting these two agreements
completed.

YOu can either call me or email me your direct mailing address and I'll
send you the Enovate contract as soon as I receive it.

Thank you,
Ellen

Please execute final document for the limited agency agreement and I will 
walk it over to Bruce next week.

Also, I need a contract  for the following transaction:
 ECT selling to Entex Gas Marketing Company
 Nov 99 - March 00
 Katy tail gate  (both packages)
 10,000/d firm at HSC minus .1725 Nov 99 - March00 
 10,000/d firm at the greater of  HSC minus .02 or $2.00 with ECT's right but 
not the obligation to recall (not sell this package) if  the first of the 
month IF HSC is $3.00 or greater.


Call me with any questions.  5388

Oh yes, since we will not know what IF HSC is until after the beginning of 
the month, we have agreed to notify Entex of our intentions one day after 
NYMEX close by Noon.   

Thanks and may the force be with you

Ellen,
     You are correct.  I do not have the information at this time.  Can you
execute without the information.  I will get Enovate to fill in the
information when I send them the contracts for their signature.    Dan

Dan, the only thing I'm missing on the Enovate contract is the

plug it in.

Thanks so much for your help.

Ellen,
     I received your voice mail and your email this morning.  I made each
of the changes from your email to the two contract documents.  Please
review and if acceptable, please start the execution process by printing
two originals of each document.  Once signed by Reliant, please forward to
me and I will have ENA sign their contract and I will attempt to get
Enovate to sign and return their contract and the two transaction
agreements to me for forwarding one fully set to you.  Please call if you
have any questions.  My phone number is (713)853-6895.

I have not had a chance to print out and review the follow, but judging from 
its sensitive nature, I felt it best to put you in the loop and seek your 
counsel as soon as possible.

Steve,
 Please see Brian Redmond note to Brenda below regarding meeting with MidCon 
to talk about their imbalances with Reliant Energy.  This could possible open 
both parties up to a torturous interference argument with Reliant Energy.  Do 
you agree?  If so, we need to nix meeting idea.

Brenda,

Can you send me a copy of Bruce's response.  Also, we need to meet on Entex 
this week as you suggest.  In my discussions with Bruce, he feels that Entex 
can account for all of their gas nominations/takes - and that these 
nominations are not related to intra-month price volatility.

We discussed having an initial meeting next week.  Then, if it makes sense, I 
think we should involve MidCon in the discussions as their imbalances seem to 
be a key factor in Entex changing their nominations.   These meetings would 
be to seek to develop a working protocol that we could use to improve 
communication and establish more definitive criteria for changing 
nominations.  

The end game would be a final meeting with Entex senior management to agree a 
solution to past sins and a way forward.

Rick and Fred:

I hope things are going well up in Salt Lake City.  I have gone through all of
Bruce's numbers today.  I have come up with a few questions that Enron needs 
to
answer.

1. Reliant claims that in East Texas the cut off for complementary customers 
is
30 Mcf/ day,  does Enron agree?
2. Reliant claims that the "New Technology Contract" overrides  or is an
exception to the Enfolio Master Agreement.  Does Enron agree that this is a
legitimate exception?
3. Reliant claims that all off the industrial mis-classified gas in the 
Houston
Division is under "special contracts" with special pricing, and even though 
they
are using less than 100 Mcf /day they receive a lower price of 2.71 per MMBTU.
Does Enron agree that this is a legitimate exception?
4. In the Houston Division it appears that Louisiana Pacific only uses gas for
heating in the winter, about three months out of the year.  Is there total
divided by three to find their average usage, or is it divided by 12?  Bruce
divided by three, we divided by twelve.  They are a customer all year, and are
not a new customer, or a customer that has left.
5. Does Enron want to give Reliant leeway on the 100 Mcf rule?  What will the
actual cut off be?  Bruce backs out 137,000 Mcf that was close, but not quite
100 Mcf.

These are the issues that I see.  The first three questions are things that
Enron may have to ask Bracewell and Patterson.  We were not notified of any of
the special contracts that he mentions.  Let me know what I need to do.  If 
you
guys have questions for me, it might be easier if we all got on the phone and
spoke about it.  Thanks,

Matthew

Dan,

We have previously provided you with hard copy of a rough draft of the 
schedule of purchase and sale contracts which support the Triple Lutz 
financial statements.  When assembling our data, we typically select a common 
counterparty name to attach to all business with those counterparties that 
have multiple entities - thus "Reliant Energy - Entex" in our schedule 
captures all business with the following counterparties:  Reliant Energy - 
Entex, Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc., Entex Gas Marketing Company  and 
Reliant Energy Services, Inc.  The spreadsheet attached sets forth the exact 
counterparty name and contract type for each of the "Reliant Energy - Entex" 
contracts included in the schedule of purchase and sale contracts previously 
provided to you.  Please also keep in mind that the schedule provided to you 
only covers purchases and sales that hit HPLC's general ledger during the 
period from 5/99 to 4/2000.

I have been sitting on the amendment you drafted which was to add several

we cannot find economic support for the Pheasant Creek City Gate, please 
delete this from your draft (to be effective 10/1/99) and resubmit to me for 
execution.  Upon Entex's execution of the Bill of Sale on Rosenburg, which we 
have been waiting for their comments for several weeks, we will then be 
prepared to execute this revised amendment.  Jim, can you prompt up Entex's 
response to the Bill of Sale so we can move this along?

Will Enovate cause us to become "undone" or what?  Today, one of our
Accountants asked me to change the address for Enovate to the Enron,
Houston address.  Just the day before, I had set contracts up in our gas
management system and used the Notices/Correspondence/Invoices section from
the Enovate contract to complete the areas of the contract that would feed
the Accounting module as well as the Contracts module, this being the
Chicago, Illinois information.  So, I politely told the Accountant that the
info in the gas management system was correct as entered.  He (the
Accountant) had spoken with an Accountant from ENA (Doug Nelson at
713/853-0560) and Doug told him that the invoices, etc. should go to
Enovate c/o Enron at 1400 Smith, Room EB3718, Houston, TX 77002.  Do you
have any objection to changing this in the contract?  Please advise, we'd
like to do what would best streamline this process.

Well Dan, hopefully, this will be ironed out one day soon and everything
will run smoothly.  Thanks again for your help.

Subject:  Enovate, L.L.C. Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement

Dan:

I have a dilemma and I'm almost too embarrassed to ask you to help me
resolve it.  As a matter of policy in this department, we are to stress the
fact that we "need" "financially firm" language in all contracts.  When the
Trader requested a contract with Enovate, he was not clear about his
trading intentions and it was assumed that "financially firm" "needed" to
be in the contract.  It seems that this language is now holding up the
execution process of the Enovate LLC contract.  The Business Unit wants
"financially firm" out and "firm" substituted.

The definition for "firm" that they want in the contract is the standard
definition for "firm" that is in the GISB as follows:

"Firm" shall mean that either party may interrupt its performance without
liability only to the extent that such performance is prevented for reasons
of Force Majeure; provided, however, that during Force Majeure
interruptions, the party invoking Force Majeure may be responsible for any
imbalance charges as set forth in Section 7.2 related to its interruption
after the nomination is made to the Transporter and until the change in
deliveries and/or receipts is confirmed by the Transporter.

I believe the only other place in the contract that "Financially Firm"
appears is on the first page, Article 2. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT:, second line,
would you please change that occurrence of "Financially Firm" to just
"firm"?

Dan, can you help me with this without trashing the whole contract?  On the
first page, we can line through "Financially" and initial, and then just
the definition page on the first page of APPENDIX "1" would have to be
redone to replace "Financially Firm" with just "Firm".

Please let me know if this is able to be done.

Thanks and I'm so sorry,

Dan, Is Entex Gas Marketing correct?  Ducote said to refer to the GISBY 
contracts for the proper name (which you may have done).

Janet,

 Can you let me know what you find out regarding that $1 million dollar pmt 
to Entex for extending the deal?  The Transaction Agreement #4 & 5, the 
buy/sell, nets out to the $1million due Entex.  Since this payment is for 
extending the deal,  shouldn't the Transaction Agreement  be between ECT & 
Reliant Energy - Entex and not Entex Gas Marketing? I will be out this 
afternoon, so could you just email me?

Thanks,
Kyle

 Why is it that all sells to Reliant Energy - Entex are billed under ECT & 
not HPLC?  I have two spot deals billed to Entex Gas Marketing under HPLC.  
Should these two deals been billed under ECT or is it ok to have a billing to 
Entex Gas Marketing under HPLC?  Could you let me know.

Hi Dan:

Just an update to let you know the status of the agreements between Reliant
and Enovate and Enron.  They are both being routed internally prior to
execution.  However, due to the "Notices" section missing from the Enovate
contract, Legal has asked that I forward that to you for execution prior to
Reliant's execution.  I hope that this is not a problem.

Dan, I don't want this contract to get misdirected, Enron's so large and
that could easily happen.  Could you please send me your direct mailing
address so that I may send it directly to you for your further handling?
Thanks, I appreciate so much your help in getting these two agreements
completed.

YOu can either call me or email me your direct mailing address and I'll
send you the Enovate contract as soon as I receive it.

Thank you,
Ellen

Dan:

I have a dilemma and I'm almost too embarrassed to ask you to help me
resolve it.  As a matter of policy in this department, we are to stress the
fact that we "need" "financially firm" language in all contracts.  When the
Trader requested a contract with Enovate, he was not clear about his
trading intentions and it was assumed that "financially firm" "needed" to
be in the contract.  It seems that this language is now holding up the
execution process of the Enovate LLC contract.  The Business Unit wants
"financially firm" out and "firm" substituted.

The definition for "firm" that they want in the contract is the standard
definition for "firm" that is in the GISB as follows:

"Firm" shall mean that either party may interrupt its performance without
liability only to the extent that such performance is prevented for reasons
of Force Majeure; provided, however, that during Force Majeure
interruptions, the party invoking Force Majeure may be responsible for any
imbalance charges as set forth in Section 7.2 related to its interruption
after the nomination is made to the Transporter and until the change in
deliveries and/or receipts is confirmed by the Transporter.

I believe the only other place in the contract that "Financially Firm"
appears is on the first page, Article 2. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT:, second line,
would you please change that occurrence of "Financially Firm" to just
"firm"?

Dan, can you help me with this without trashing the whole contract?  On the
first page, we can line through "Financially" and initial, and then just
the definition page on the first page of APPENDIX "1" would have to be
redone to replace "Financially Firm" with just "Firm".

Please let me know if this is able to be done.

Thanks and I'm so sorry,

Ellen Dailey

Good Morning Dan:

Hope your Thanksgiving was safe and happy.

Legal and Credit have returned the contracts from final review and the only
two edits we would ask are as follows:

Page 2 - ARTICLE 4 DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES
     4.1 Early Termination:  At the top of page 2, second column, please
delete the reference to arbitration of the Termination Payment and perhaps
use something like "good faith efforts by both parties......".

Page 1 of Appendix I - DEFINITIONS
     Following the definition for "Delivery Point(s)" and before the
definition for "Force Majeure", please include the definition for
"Financially Firm".
     "Financially Firm" shall mean that the parties have agreed that the
performance obligation of Seller to delivery and sell and Buyer to receive
and purchase is only excused if it is physically impossible for a party to
deliver or receive Gas in accordance with its obligations under a
Transaction because Gas is not available (at any price), or cannot be made
available (at any price) via transportation (at any price) to the Delivery
Point(s) to enable performance consistent with the terms of a Transaction.

Dan, please call or email me if anything is unclear and it's my
understanding that these same edits would be mirrored in both agreements,
the Enron North America one as well as the Enovate contract.  My phone
number again is 713.207.3266.

Thanks,
Ellen Dailey

 All of the sales to Reliant Energy Entex and/or Entex Gas Marketing Company

two deals that you have under HPL so that we can get them documented under

Should these two deals been billed under ECT or is it ok to have a billing to 
Entex Gas Marketing under HPLC?  Could you let me know.

Thanks,
Kyle

Jim called this morning to inquire about Coogler's response to the 3BCF.  I 
have forwarded a question to AA, and when I hear back, I'll get a meeting 
scheduled.

Brenda,

Can you send me a copy of Bruce's response.  Also, we need to meet on Entex 
this week as you suggest.  In my discussions with Bruce, he feels that Entex 
can account for all of their gas nominations/takes - and that these 
nominations are not related to intra-month price volatility.

We discussed having an initial meeting next week.  Then, if it makes sense, I 
think we should involve MidCon in the discussions as their imbalances seem to 
be a key factor in Entex changing their nominations.   These meetings would 
be to seek to develop a working protocol that we could use to improve 
communication and establish more definitive criteria for changing 
nominations.  

The end game would be a final meeting with Entex senior management to agree a 
solution to past sins and a way forward.

Brian

Please read the attached summary of Coogler's response to the audit 
findings.  I would like to get the group together later this week to 
determine next steps.  

Jim, Dan and Janet:  I would appreciate you all paying special attention to 
the claims.  Do you all know what Bruce is referring to?  If you all can do 
some research before the meeting, I think we'll be able to get to our next 
steps quicker.  Thanks.

Brenda,

Matthew reviewed Coogler's responses and brings up the following questions.

We can do one-of-two things at this point.  We can either add the Reliant
responses to our audit report as "Auditee Responses", or we can have Enron
provide answers and possibly have us do some additional work.  The additional
work is dependent on Enron's answers to the questions.

Please advise.

Rick

Rick and Fred:

I hope things are going well up in Salt Lake City.  I have gone through all of
Bruce's numbers today.  I have come up with a few questions that Enron needs 
to
answer.

1. Reliant claims that in East Texas the cut off for complementary customers 
is
30 Mcf/ day,  does Enron agree?
2. Reliant claims that the "New Technology Contract" overrides  or is an
exception to the Enfolio Master Agreement.  Does Enron agree that this is a
legitimate exception?
3. Reliant claims that all off the industrial mis-classified gas in the 
Houston
Division is under "special contracts" with special pricing, and even though 
they
are using less than 100 Mcf /day they receive a lower price of 2.71 per MMBTU.
Does Enron agree that this is a legitimate exception?
4. In the Houston Division it appears that Louisiana Pacific only uses gas for
heating in the winter, about three months out of the year.  Is there total
divided by three to find their average usage, or is it divided by 12?  Bruce
divided by three, we divided by twelve.  They are a customer all year, and are
not a new customer, or a customer that has left.
5. Does Enron want to give Reliant leeway on the 100 Mcf rule?  What will the
actual cut off be?  Bruce backs out 137,000 Mcf that was close, but not quite
100 Mcf.

These are the issues that I see.  The first three questions are things that
Enron may have to ask Bracewell and Patterson.  We were not notified of any of
the special contracts that he mentions.  Let me know what I need to do.  If 
you
guys have questions for me, it might be easier if we all got on the phone and
spoke about it.  Thanks,

Matthew
