Subject:	RE: Motion To Reject Gas Transportation Contracts

This morning I had the opportunity to discuss the issue of Transportation Contract rejection with David Zdunkewicz of Andrews and Kurth.  He and his partner Jeff Spiers have been advising other Enron divisions regarding the contract rejection process.  

I am told that a motion has been filed with the bankruptcy court requesting that shorthand procedures be established for the purpose of allowing the various Enron Debtors to reject executory contracts.  That motion is apparently slated to be heard on January 7.  The attached template describes the information that must be filed with the court and forwarded to the creditors' committee and to the relevant counterparty whose contract is being rejected.  Assuming that the order is approved, we'll be able to start rejecting transportation contracts as early as January 8.  

Kelli and Maria,

In order to expedite the process, could you please fill out the attached template, providing the information requested. 

Please call with any questions.

Thanks for your help.

Attached is an e:mail that I forwarded to Jeff Speirs, a bankruptcy attorney with Andrews and Kurth who will be assisting with the mechanics of rejecting the out of the money transportation agreements that you all have identified.  I imagine that we will need full company names, contact persons and addresses in order to place the different pipes on notice of the motion to reject.  Could you please coordinate the gathering of this information so that we will be in a position to act on it as soon as possible after New Years?  Thanks for your help.

Jeff,

I am an Enron Wholesale Services attorney who is advising on ENA gas transportation matters.  Elizabeth Sager suggested that I contact you about assisting me with the preparation of a Motion to Reject the bulk of the executory transportation service agreements that ENA has with interstate pipeline companies.  

The attached spreadsheet summarizes the terms of said transportation agreements; please note that the first sheet of the spreadsheet file describes the 5 transportation contracts that ENA wishes to assume; the remainer are out of the money transportation and storage arrangements that ENA desires to reject.  Please review the attached and let me know if it contains sufficient information with which to proceed with the preparation of the Motion.  

I imagine you will have plenty of questions. . . . I myself have a number of questions regarding the agency relationships shown on the spreadsheet, as well as ENA's right or need to reject those Service Agreements under which ENA has heretofore released pipeline capacity to third parties.  

I look forward to speaking with you about these matters as well as determing the timeframe for rejecting these contracts.

DTI have reached a 637 settlement with it's customers, they have filed with FERC for approval, the first pipeline to reach a settlement. The settlement includes the netting and trading of imbalances, intraday recalls on released capacity, and other GISB mandates that took years to implement but in reality have no application to the industry.
Liquidity has increased on the system, TTT volumes have increased from 3 Bcf/d to 5 Bcf/d over the last year with a 5:1 ration of physical to traded volumes. 
The interconnect with Empire @ Lysander currently flowing 30-60,000dt/d has a maximum capability of 100,000dt/d.  Empire is now allowing secondary deliveries to Lysander therefore volumes have increased at the location.  Note:  Empire recently bought out by Union from ANR.
DTI have an new pipeline project called Green brier.  A new company will be started that will consist of DTI as part owners and operators and other equity interests.  The new pipeline will flow 600,000 dt/d from Cornwell (interconnect with Tennessee and DTI) and run down through VA, into Granville County, NC.
DTI are offering winter only (30cents) and summer only (13cents) service, the project is designed to compete with Transco's Momentum expansion into Zn4.  
DTI have remarketed all the 55 Bcf of GSS that was turned back over the past year and also reconstructed for 90% of the 2.2 Bcf/d of transport.
Another project they are looking to release to the market is an expansion of deliveries to Leidy in conjunction with Marketlink.
DTI have a current transportation offering, Lebanon to Leidy capacity 29,100dt/d, for one year starting 11/1/01.  DTI are looking and will probably get max rates (approximately 30 cents).
DTI will be increasing the transportation fuel rates from 2.28% to 2.78% as per a TCRA settlement recently agreed to by it's customers.  The net effect of this will be a small reduction in the delivered quantity at the delivery locations and a small amount of stranded receipt point capacity on peak days.  This news has not been released to the market, I'm not sure when this will take effect.

Ed,
We received invoices for MRT transport for DEC 01. We did not use this transport to deliver to keeper markets. Do we pay this bill?? I am assuming we don't but wanted to verify with you.

Please note that I have transposed the payment and the credit due to MichCon for the February 2002 Storage Invoice.  The Payment to MichCon should be $14,350 and the credit should be $20,950.

Sorry for the mistake.  I guess I need some time off for good behavior.

Subject:	MichCon Storage Post Petition Payment Approval

I need Legal's authorization to pay Michigan Consolidated Gas Company for the post petition storage withdrawal costs & monthly administration charges associated with Sylvia Pollan's deal to sell 50,000 Dth/day from ENA's MichCon storage contract to CMS Marketing Services and Trading Company for January 1, 2002 through March 31, 2002.  ENA sold the January gas for $2.755/Dth, the February gas for $2.385/Dth, and the March gas for $2.385/Dth.  Jeff Hodge approved the original sale to CMS and was involved with negotiating with MichCon on this and a number of other matters.

ENA put up a $60,000.00 deposit to MichCon on January 10th to maintain our credit-worthiness and keep the storage agreement active so that ENA's storage balance could be sold to CMS.  That deposit will be used to pay $20,950.00 of the total $35,300.00 February 2002 storage bill and $39,050.00 of the $39,050.00 March 2002 storage bill.  Since Sylvia did not complete getting the storage payment authorization approved prior to leaving the company, this is now my mission.  

ENA must pay the January 2002 storage invoice of $39,050.00 by March 11, 2002 or MichCon will suspend the agreement and will not accept any withdrawal nominations until payment is received.  The storage agreement terminates on March 31, 2002.  If ENA has a remaining storage balance at the termination date, MichCon's tariff allows the pipeline to cash-out the balance at Index minus $0.50 per Dth.  If storage withdrawals are not accepted by MichCon after March 11th, ENA would also not be able to deliver volumes to CMS for the balance of the month of March and $2.385 million of sales revenues would be at risk.

Please approve:

$39,050.00 payment to MichCon by March 11, 2002 for January 2002 Storage Invoice
$20,950.00 payment to MichCon by March 24, 2002 for February 2002 Storage Invoice ($14,350 of deposit to be shown as invoice credit)
$0.00 payment to MichCon for March 2002 Storage invoice ($39,050 of deposit to be shown as invoice credit)

Joe,  Thanks for the heads up.  We need to get information from you and others regarding EES capacity so we can compile the list to assume and cure post-petition claims or reject and terminate/release.  We have already initiated this effort for EES and need to move to completion this week.

Chris, Maria, Kelli - Please gather the information we already have and plan on getting together at 11:00 AM today to discuss.  If you have any questions, please ask.
Ed

Don,
I was contacted by Mike Stoll with MRT Pipeline regarding our FirmTransport Agreements. We have 2 agreements of 3583/day ending 5/31/04 and 577/day ending 10/31/04 totaling 4160/day delivering to LeClede. This LDC is not on the Top ten list and we are incurring demand charges daily. They offered to take back the transport at max rate which is what we paid. I don't think it is something of value and we should go ahead and release it back to them. They will draft up the paperwork and send to me for review. What do you want to do?
Thanks,
Joe

NGI Summaries on several projects attached, please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information--SMC

Williams: MarketLink Phase 1 Is Open for Business 
Williams said Wednesday that it has completed the first phase of the Transco pipeline system's MarketLink expansion project, which will provide much needed incremental natural gas transportation capacity into the northeastern United States. The company added that this project represents the first interstate pipeline expansion completed to serve the New York metropolitan area since 1992. 
"Williams Gas Pipeline-Transco has provided reliable, economic gas transportation services to the Northeast for over 50 years and is committed to meeting the growing energy requirements in the region," said Gary Lauderdale, senior vice president and general manager, Williams' Transco pipeline. "This area, which includes Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York, continues to experience a need for additional natural gas to serve residential, commercial and power generation facilities. MarketLink will help meet this need." 
The MarketLink project, which received the go-ahead from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on April 26, 2000, is being constructed in two phases. The first phase was completed and entered into service on Wednesday. It will deliver an incremental 166,000 Dth/d of natural gas. The second phase of the project, which will be placed in service in November 2002, will deliver an additional 130,000 Dth/d to the region. 
"Phase 1 of MarketLink will provide much needed capacity to the region in time for the winter heating season," said Mario DiCocco, Williams' Transco pipeline director of operations for the Princeton division, which covers New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. "We will begin construction of Phase II next spring." 
Williams pointed out that there are more than a dozen new gas-fueled power plants currently in the permitting process in New Jersey alone. Gas transported by MarketLink is expected to fuel new efficient power plants that are needed to meet the region's growing electricity needs and help meet Clean Air Act standards

Islander East Receives FERC's Preliminary Determination 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a preliminary determination on non-environmental issues to the Islander East Pipeline Co. LLC to build a 40-mile pipeline that will bring natural gas from Connecticut to Long Island, NY. 
Duke Energy Gas Transmission (DEGT) and KeySpan Energy Delivery Long Island (KEDLI) first announced its plans for the proposed line in January.  The proposed pipeline project will be equally owned by the two companies under Islander East Pipeline LLC. 
Originating from DEGT's Algonquin Gas Transmission's system, the pipeline --- made from 24-inch and 30-inch diameter pipe --- would extend from Connecticut across Long Island Sound to Wading River, NY, and other points on Long Island, where it would connect with KEDLI. The companies believe the time is right for Islander East because it would have access to almost every major supply basin in North America, including the recently developed Sable Island off the coast of Nova Scotia in Atlantic Canada. Its backers said it would be possible through Algonquin's proposed interconnection with Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline. 
The companies said that they expect to have the pipeline operating in 2003, initially providing 250,000 Dth/d of natural gas to the Long Island and New York City energy markets, enough to heat 600,000 homes. 
However, the Islander East project is not the only game in town. Following the Islander announcement, El Paso Corp.'s Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. revealed a project that would provide up to 450,000 Dth/d of new transportation capacity from the company's interconnection with joint facilities of Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline LLC. and Portland Natural Gas Transmission System Co. in Dracut, MA, and terminate in Suffolk County on eastern Long Island.
Tennessee said its project will deliver to various local distribution companies and their facilities, including Yankee Gas Services, Connecticut Natural Gas, Southern Connecticut Gas and KeySpan Energy Delivery Long Island, as well as directly to proposed power generating plants along the way. 
Also throwing its hat into the ring back in April, Iroquois Gas Transmission System LP announced an open season yesterday for Zone 2 firm transportation capacity for delivery on its proposed Eastern Long Island Expansion.
Iroquois proposes to construct 20 miles of 24-inch diameter marine pipeline from Milford, CT, to Shoreham, Long Island, and points farther inland as the market demands.

Maritimes Phase III, HubLine, Iroquois' Eastchester Receive Final FERC Nods 
FERC issued final certificates Wednesday morning to the Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline Phase III expansion project and related HubLine expansion by Algonquin Gas Transmission. The integrated expansions will increase transportation of Atlantic Canadian gas to the Boston area. In addition, Iroquois' Eastchester project received a final green light from FERC. The $174 million Eastchester project will add 230,000 Dth/d of capacity to the Iroquois system to increase deliveries mainly to New York City power generators. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission denied rolled-in rate treatment for Eastchester, stating that, contrary to Iroquois' claims, the project's cost actually would exceed its revenues, requiring existing firm shippers to subsidize a portion of the project. Iroquois had said the project would provide $2.8 million in annual net financial benefits, but FERC found that it actually would cost existing shippers $2.9 million. As a result, the Commission left the rates to be settled in a future proceeding. 
The 33-mile pipeline extension will connect Iroquois' existing system in Suffolk County with Consolidated Edison's system in the Bronx. Iroquois hopes to complete the extension by November 2002. It signed 10-year precedent agreements for the capacity with five shippers: Virginia Power Energy Marketing (20,000 Dth/d), Mirant New York Management (60,000), KeySpan Ravenswood (60,000), Consolidated Edison Energy (30,000) and Orion Power Holdings (60,000). ConEd, KeySpan and Orion will use their capacity to serve power generation load. FERC also said the pipeline must finalize its agreements with shippers prior to moving forward with construction. 
Iroquois Gas Transmission System is a partnership of 10 U.S. and Canadian energy firms and is owner of a 375-mile interstate pipeline extending from the U.S.-Canadian border at Waddington, NY, through western Connecticut to Long Island, NY. 
The companion expansion projects of Maritimes & Northeast and Algonquin call for Maritimes to construct an extension in a southeasterly direction through several Massachusetts counties to the East Coast where a new Algonquin line would connect and extend offshore down the coast through Boston Bay to a connection with Algonquin's existing system at Weymouth on the south side of Boston Harbor. The two pipeline projects are designed to supply up to 230,500 Dth/d to the gas-starved New England region and are targeted for service by November 2002. 
The so-called Phase III extension of the 600-mile Maritimes pipeline, which imports Atlantic Canadian gas to the Northeast from the Sable Offshore Energy Project offshore Nova Scotia, will include 24 miles of 30-inch diameter pipeline and one mile of 24-inch diameter pipeline, extending from Methuen, MA, through a number of counties to a connection with Algonquin's proposed extension in Beverly, MA. The project, which has an estimated price tag of $133.9 million, would provide firm transportation service to serve growing markets on the east end of Algonquin's system. 
Algonquin's HubLine project, which has a projected cost of $127 million, will include about 29 miles of 24-inch diameter pipeline, extending offshore from an interconnection near Beverly with Maritimes' proposed Phase III project to an interconnection with Algonquin's existing I-9 lateral in Weymouth. Algonquin also plans to build a 5.4-mile, 16-inch diameter lateral from the proposed pipeline to a wastewater treatment plant owned by Massachusetts Water Resources Authority on Deer Island.

Following up on a "to do" that I took on last Friday, and in response to Chris' prompting of yesterday--thanks Chris--attached is a generic form of the short term capacity release agreement that we entered into with Transwestern for remainder of January business.  

Please feel free to forward this form to other pipelines who are inquiring about short term releases for February business.  Please note that is contains a 50/50 sharing of upside if the pipeline releases the capacity for more than ENA's contract rate.  Delete that feature before sending, if you don't what to offer such an incentive.

Okay, not sure who, if anyone, cares or needs to know BUT . . . . 

Stingray Pipeline Company (34271) has been changed to Stingray Pipeline Company, L.L.C. (200104). This change created a new Global Counterparty number so it prompted manual changes to the Pipeline Name & Pipeline Counterparty data within Global Facilities. It also prompted the need to move (via assignment within Global Contracts) all service related agreements from the old GCP record to the new GCP record. I left both names on the Global Record, BUT due to system controls can only have 1 listed with the role of "Pipeline". This role was assigned to the "new" name & the old name (which is now a suspended GCP record) was made "Alternate Payee". This was a "guess" role - - - - and I have no idea of how the service side is impacted or at what level it validates the Global record attached to the deal. All contract services are the same on each record, but the role of "Pipeline" now resides with the new GCP.

Can you either let all those who need to know - - - know & let me know who/how should I share information like this in the future. You got a Transportation Greenie (just 'learned' how to change pipeline names today) over here.

Thanks so much!!

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) in Canada is levied on sales of gas at a delivery point in Canada and where the gas will not be exported from Canada. The buyer pays the seller the amount of the  GST which is a per cent of the purchase price.  The seller, in turn, remits the amount of the GST to the appropriate Canadian authority.  In structuring the deal, be sure that you make it clear that the Contract Price does not include the GST.   If the gas it to be exported the buyer needs to notify that the gas is "zero-rated"  so it is not subject to the GST.
 
Wade - Do you know who in settlements is handling GST payments?  I hope we still have someone who can do that.  
 
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.    Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.  According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.  Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".  The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.  Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!  So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that applies to this deal. 

Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.  Before I sell the gas, I will 

        1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 
        2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.

Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.  Are there any special tax issues to address?

Yes we picked up the ANR transport directly and as for he others I do not know if they are release or not. I would assume if they are not in our name then they would be released capacity from the contracted party or successor. We may have picked some capacity up with the purchase of the PG&E book last year. Call me at x52503 as we can discuss.
Maria-Our contact at MRT is Mike Stoll at 314-991-7405 and he contacted me and wants to buy the agreements back asap at Max rates which is what we own them at I believe. 
My ANR contact is Joyce Quinten @ 882-676-2603. 
PEPL contact would be Mark Wilke at 713-989-7574( I spoke with the nominations rep and she said Mark sent a letter  that I have not seen)

Hello!

A few pending questions regarding central transportation contracts.

1. PEPL and MRT contracts - Are these capacity release, agency, or do we own them?  The ANR agreements indicate that we own those. The MRT agreements appear to state that they were released. If these are release contracts have they been recalled?

2. Can you provide the contact name and title, the address and the fax number for the ANR, PEPL and MRT. We need to provide notification of turn back for the contracts that we own.

Thanks a lot. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Maria

Hi Chris

Pursuant to our conversation, the last nom activity was:

1250-05 (2,017 Dth/d):
"jcollins" zeroed out the nom on 12/04/01 for the 12/05/01 gas day and
forward

1250-08 (35,679 Dth/d):
"jcollins" zeroed out the nom on 12/04/01 for the 12/05/01 gas day and
forward

I forgot to give you Ivy's number when we spoke.  Call her at
203-944-7020 and she will walk you through the capacity release process
on Iroquois OnLine.

take care

At 12:55 pm, I received a call from Gene Nowak, one of Trailblazer's capacity release coordinators, to notify ENA that the pipeline will not allow ENA to post our capacity for temporary release on Friday, January 25th.  This is "Trailblazer's decision for now, however, they will look at it again on Monday".


History - Action Item from the 9 am meeting on Friday -- Release the Trailblazer capacity for 2/1/02 through 9/30/02 with no prearranged bidder
  
At 11:00 am on Friday, January 25th, I tried to post ENA's Trailblazer capacity for temporary release through the  pipeline's website.  I was not able to electronically access the contract, and post the contract for capacity release.  It appeared that ENA was locked out from using the capacity release portion of the website.  

I notified Steve Van Hooser of the situation and he called Emory Biro to discuss the issue.

After Trailblazer returned my call, Gene Nowak confirmed that the pipeline had blocked ENA's ability to release the Trailblazer capacity.  This began earlier in the week after my Tuesday afternoon conference call with Joan Solund and Andy Edling.  TBPL wanted to make sure that there was no misunderstanding about their legal stance that contracts had to be assumed, prior to posting the capacity for release. 

I restated ENA's position that we wanted to exercise our contractual right to release this capacity as per TBPL's tariff and the FERC's regulations.  We wanted to have the posting happen Friday afternoon so that the four business day posting requirement could be met and the capacity be awarded effective February 1, 2002.  I also told Gene that we were not allowed to make the release that ENA was prepared to address this issue with the FERC.  Gene confirmed the details of what our proposed release and went to discuss the situation with his supervisor.  I told him that Steve was probably already talking to Emory.

At 11:40I left a phone message with Mark Kissell informing him of what had happened and what was our intention if we were denied posting the capacity for release.

Jim,

As requested, Enron North America Corp. is confirming that Sacramento Municipal Utility District has acquired Parcel 8887.0 and a portion of Parcel 8889.0 through the capacity release process.  Both of SMUD's bids are not contingent on satisfying any conditions, therefore, the capacity described below should be awarded effective February 1, 2002.  

Parcel 8887.0:

	10,000 Dth/day 		Kingsgate to Malin	02/01/02 through 10/31/05	100% of Max Tariff Rate	(approx $0.298595 per Dth)

Parcel 8889.0:

	10,000 Dth/day 		Kingsgate to Malin	02/01/02 through 10/31/08	100% of Max Tariff Rate	(approx $0.471975 per Dth)


Unfortunately, no one bid on the remaining 42,500 Dth/day of capacity in Parcel 8889.0, or the 10,099 Dth/day of capacity in Parcel 8885.0 which terminates on 10/31/02.

Call me if you need anything else,

Per Mark Ellenberg, there is no need to do anything at this stage.  Just let them expire and they'll be considered unsecured claims.

We have two firm transportation agreements on Tennessee Pipeline.  The long term Boston Gas capacity release and a short term contract which expires on 1/31/2002.  The monthly demand charge on the short term capacity is $15,200.00.

Do we need to reject the short term capacity before it expires?  To my knowledge, we did not flow any gas on this contract for December or January.

Don,
I was contacted by Mike Stoll with MRT Pipeline regarding our FirmTransport Agreements. We have 2 agreements of 3583/day ending 5/31/04 and 577/day ending 10/31/04 totaling 4160/day delivering to LeClede. This LDC is not on the Top ten list and we are incurring demand charges daily. They offered to take back the transport at max rate which is what we paid. I don't think it is something of value and we should go ahead and release it back to them. They will draft up the paperwork and send to me for review. What do you want to do?
Thanks,
Joe

Hi All--

Attached is the Inside FERC summary of the FERC's order in the Transco 1Line / Order 637 proceeding and in the Texas Gas cash-out proceeding.

Transco is saying they won't implement "prior to April 1" but haven't decided on an implementation and training schedule as of yet. .The Order did not specify a date by which Transco had to implement.  Transco will have to make another filing to comply with this Order, so it may still be a little while before everything is finalized.  Given that the FERC did not speak to the cost of the system in this order (almost $80m), it's likely that the dollars will be subject to the on-going negotiations taking place in Transco's RP01-245 rate case proceeding.   I'll coordinate with Tammy to insure that we've got the necessary EDI testing plan in place and that we make the necessary Unify changes.

On Texas Gas, this represents a minor win for us--we had argued that Texas Gas' proposal was not consistent with Order 637 and that they should adopt a more "Transco-like" scheme that creates uncertainty w/o creating undue penalties.  Texas Gas will have to refile & we'll have another go-round between the marketing companies/producers and the LDC's on the Texas Gas system.  Will keep you posted.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

=============================================================================================================
TRANSCO GETS GREEN LIGHT TO IMPLEMENT 1LINE SYSTEM, OTHER RATE CHANGES

Capping a long-running debate over the 1Line proposal, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., with only a minor exception or two, received approval from FERC to implement a new online, interactive computer system. Last month's ruling also went a long way toward completing Transco's effort to comply with orders 637 and 587.  The 1Line system was proposed to enable Transco and other subsidiaries of The Williams Cos. Inc. to put in place new practices and services, including ones related to compliance with orders 637 and 587.

According to Transco, its new scheme cannot be supported by its existing computer systems. But the commission last spring said it was not satisfied with Transco's proposal and asked for a more detailed explanation of how 1Line complies with orders 637 and 587 (IF, 2 April, 16). Looking at the 1Line plan from an order 637 and 587 perspective, FERC in the Sept. 27 order (RP01-236, et al.) found most of the scheme to its liking. It accepted Transco's proposal to change the capacity-release bidding and awarding processes, to incorporate pooling services in its tariff as a new pooling rate schedule, and to provide that any adjustments to a demand bill will be included in a subsequent demand bill, rather than the subsequent commodity bill.

The commission approved Transco's proposal on scheduling equality, which allows shippers acquiring released capacity to submit a nomination at the earliest opportunity after the acquisition of capacity. To raise its comfort level about the provision, FERC directed Transco to change the tariff to permit a shipper's nomination to coincide with the notification of the capacity release transaction and to remove restrictions on the releasing shipper's ability to specify when the release will become effective. FERC also generally was pleased with the provision directing customers to indemnify and hold harmless Transco against all claims. In response to one protester, the commission told the company to remove language that would force customers to indemnify Transco's affiliates as well.

On order 637 matters, FERC was mostly sympathetic to Transco's positions on issues such as imbalance services, operational controls and penalty revenue sharing.
FERC was less enthused with Transco's preferred approach to interaction between the pipeline's segmentation and discounting policies. Refuting the claim that it already complies with order 637 on this issue, FERC directed Transco to add language to its tariff creating a presumption that Transco can rebut a segmenting shipper's right to retain a discounted rate as long as Transco demonstrates that a segmented or secondary point is not similarly situated to point identified in the original transaction. Transco also must add a procedure to its tariff that requires requests to retain discounts to be processed within two hours.

FERC also accepted Transco's existing imbalance cash-out tolerances and tiered cash-out mechanisms, but wanted more information on proposed unauthorized overrun penalties. The pipeline has not ad-equately justified "why such substantial overrun penalties should apply on non-critical days," said the
commission. FERC rejected Transco's proposed transportation charge for imbalance trading, which the pipeline said was needed to recover what it asserts are lost transportation charges. The commission ruled that "Transco has failed to demonstrate that imbalance trades between zones necessarily results in a loss of transportation revenue." But the commission went on to say that it "may be willing to reconsider a remedy if Transco can show that shippers are abusing imbalance trading" to avoid certain charges.

Transco also was directed to justify its proposal to prohibit shippers from trading transportation imbalances and operational balancing agreement imbalances. FERC said that "it is not clear from Transco's explanation why OBA imbalances are so different from shipper transportation imbalances that the two cannot be traded."

=============================================================================================================
FERC ACCEPTED TEXAS GAS' PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE IMBALANCES on its system by revising its cashout mechanism, while rejecting the proposed use of high/low daily pricing for cashouts. The revamped mechanism, which was developed during and after a technical conference, would enable Texas Gas Transmission Co. to "remove the incentive to engage in price arbitrage on its system," FERC said.

To stop customers from gaming its system, Texas Gas in March proposed (RP01-278) a plan to create a new monthly imbalance tier that would not be subject to cashouts, to eliminate pool-to-pool transfers in the calculation of customer imbalances, and to do away with the provision allowing a processor replacing
plant volume reduction to have its imbalances cashed out at 100% of the applicable index price. Seeing the need for the proposed changes, the commission noted that Texas Gas "has demonstrated with its data a close correlation between the imbalance and price arbitrage that has been taking place for years and has not subsided."

However, FERC rejected the idea of changing the applicable cashout price index at all tier levels to a percentage of either the highest or lowest daily price during the month. Directing Texas Gas to drop the proposed language, the order explained that daily high/low index prices "may unduly increase penalties for imbalances, which is contrary to order 637."

The order went on to say that "a less draconian measure" may be appropriate. For instance, Texas Gas could propose a mechanism "that would inject an element of uncertainty regarding the eventual price" if it wanted to provide "an incentive for shippers to remain in balance," FERC said.

Phil,

For the MichCon storage payment that is to be paid on 3/25, please change the note and delete that the payment request is still pending.  I gave my stuff to Doug on Thursday night and Rita was finishing up the wiring form last night.  

For the $5313 payment for the Bear Creek storage et. al. that is shown to be paid on 3/25, we need to delay the payment until we can resolve the pricing and volume questions with the pipeline.  I recommend that it be delayed until say 3/29.  There is a chance that the payment will be lower than $5313 once we get everything resolved.  Is there a problem if the payment is reduced right before it goes out the door?

Ruth

I have released the Boston Gas capacity on Tennessee, contract 29667, and Iroquois, contract 1250-08, to Boston Gas, non-recallable, subject to bid (per Boston Gas's request), for Feb 1st for one month only.

Other transport notes;

To serve the Lilco deal, we need supply on Texas Eastern, Tennessee, and Transco.

Texas Eastern is trying to decide how to handle the cash out exposure.  There is no commodity expense on the type of agreement I am requesting but there is the possibility of cash out.  I think the exposure to Texas Eastern is minimal and it could be that Texas Eastern just wants to be difficult to work with.

We can still flow gas on our Tennessee pooling contract.

We need an IT contract on Transco.  Transco requires a prepayment or a letter of credit using the following formula, MDQ x 90 days x max it rate from Zone 1 to Zone 6 ($.5169).  I believe the Lilco volume on Transco is about 21,000 dth/day.  Therefore, we would need to give Transco a letter of credit for about $977,000.00.

I also believe that we could do a buy/sale on Transco and Texas Eastern and bypass the pooling process.


Donna, Victor,
I like to keep scheduling informed of all activity on my pipes.  I plan on copying Ruth, Kathy, Maria, and Kim on my emails.  Who should I include from scheduling?

Thanks

Because the names of the 2 pipeline tracking spreadsheets were so similar and somewhat confusing, I changed the name of one of them.

The spreadsheet that lists the pipelines and the numerical status of the pipeline is now named "Pipeline Status Summary" - (formerly Pipeline Contact List) - it is still located in the transportation directory.

The file that contains the detailed contract information by pipeline is still named "Pipeline Contract List"


If you have any questions, please let me know.

Maria

Transport Team

It appears that in our efforts to collect information from the pipelines we are duplicating some efforts. 

Rita Wynne's team is also actively collecting and reviewing pipeline invoice information. She has suggested that we coordinate with her team to more efficiently gather the information and keep the pipelines from getting bombarded with requests. The pipelines have been assigned to specific people in her group.

We should continue to contact the pipelines and request a list of their active agreements, inform them of our intentions to work with them and let them know that someone in our group is in the process of confirming outstanding invoice information with them as well  and would appreciate their cooperation. We should then work directly with our internal contact to determine the status of the invoice claims.

Rita will need a prioritized list of the pipelines. We can get together as a group and decide on the best way to prioritize the list.  I will provide her with the same list that PW will get - "Pipeline Status Summary" so that she can get a feel on were we stand with each pipeline. She will also have access to the detailed contract list were we are tracking the dollar amounts for each agreement.

Thanks
Maria

Steve,

This email is to notify Columbia Gas Transmission of Enron North America's intention to exercise our right of first refusal for the subject contracts.  By this notification, Enron does not agree to continue the agreements beyond the current expiration date or match the highest value bid in any subsequent auction.  If you have any questions concerning this notification, please feel free to call me at (713) 853 - 7276.

Thanks for your help,

John

Chris

Since you are not using the smaller contract at all, and it is a true
Enron contract (as opposed to capacity release), you can release that one
as well, to anyone.  We may be able to help you find a home for it.  The
liability right now is about $27,000 a month.

Call me to discuss.

I spoke again this morning to Pamela Brumbaugh at Texas Gas Transmission about contract #T018176.       This contract was acquired by capacity release from SIGCORP ENERGY.    Since ENA failed to pay the bill for November 2001 production,   then TGT's tariff allows them to go back to the original contract party -- SIGCORP ENERGY to get payment.    So TGT reversed the demand charges on our invoice and in turn sent an invoice to SIGCORP for this November 2001 production demand payment.    Thus it would appear that eventually ENA would have to make payment to SIGCORP Energy,   but as this winds thru the bankruptcy proceedings,  this issue will need to get clarified.

Chris Spears -- please put a copy of this email in your TGT files.

Chris,
We tried to get Ed Michael, Bob Hall, Ruth, Kim, Kathy, etc.... together last week for a quick overview of what business is still on-going .... but had to cancel.  I think we need to try to get that meeting rescheduled.  By the way...Kim will be leading Logistics for wholesale business that will continue with the estate.  Once she determines what business is out there, she can then allocate out to the team.  This is one item we were hoping to nail down in last weeks meeting.  We'll be sure to include you when its rescheduled.   Thanks!!!

Chrissy, Right now Clarissa is doing Tennessee.  Meredith, Robert and Chris O are doing Transco, Tetco and Iroquois as a team.  Going forward Donna will have to let you know of her plans for handling this on the estate, but we'll help out anyway we can. I have cc:'d them on your note THANKS.

Subject:	Transportation notes for Feb

I have released the Boston Gas capacity on Tennessee, contract 29667, and Iroquois, contract 1250-08, to Boston Gas, non-recallable, subject to bid (per Boston Gas's request), for Feb 1st for one month only.

Other transport notes;

To serve the Lilco deal, we need supply on Texas Eastern, Tennessee, and Transco.

Texas Eastern is trying to decide how to handle the cash out exposure.  There is no commodity expense on the type of agreement I am requesting but there is the possibility of cash out.  I think the exposure to Texas Eastern is minimal and it could be that Texas Eastern just wants to be difficult to work with.

We can still flow gas on our Tennessee pooling contract.

We need an IT contract on Transco.  Transco requires a prepayment or a letter of credit using the following formula, MDQ x 90 days x max it rate from Zone 1 to Zone 6 ($.5169).  I believe the Lilco volume on Transco is about 21,000 dth/day.  Therefore, we would need to give Transco a letter of credit for about $977,000.00.

I also believe that we could do a buy/sale on Transco and Texas Eastern and bypass the pooling process.


Donna, Victor,
I like to keep scheduling informed of all activity on my pipes.  I plan on copying Ruth, Kathy, Maria, and Kim on my emails.  Who should I include from scheduling?

Thanks

Just another quick interesting note:  I have letters from Duke, Dominion, and National Fuel where these pipelines were terminating our service due to lack of credit.  All of these letters were received back in Nov and Dec of 2001.  I gave them to Daniel to scan and the files are now in the appropriate pipeline directories.  However, since these are scanned, they are "pdf" files and not "doc" files.  I use Adobe Acrobat to access these files.  So just keep it in mind that there may be other documents besides word and excel files.

Subject:	Pipeline Note ideas

Attached are my first notes on Tennessee pipeline.  RUTH, you need to read these notes and render and opinion <== that's an accounting term.

Of course all rules are made to be broken but here are some ideas

1.  Put the notes in a word document and save it with the following naming scheme
		Notes_(pipeline name).doc 

		Example ==>  Notes_Tennessee.doc

2.  Save the document under the pipeline directory, 
		o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy Folder/Transportation/(pipeline name)/Notes_(pipeline name).doc

		Example ==>  o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy Folder/Transportation/Tennessee/Notes_Tennessee.doc

	Since we are just starting the process on most of the pipelines, we will need to create new directories for most of the pipelines.

3.  At a minimum, put the date you are making the notes, I don't think the time is so important.  I put in the time when its conversation, I just put in the date when I spend a couple hours working on something.  Ha - me work a couple of hours!!

4.  Put your initials at the end of the note so we know who made it.

5.  When you put someone's name in the document, put their phone number and tell us who it is, at least the first time you mention their name if that person is not someone we all deal with.  usually this would be the person your are speaking with at the pipeline.  First person that comes to me and says "buy me a pop" gets $.60.

6.  Last and certainly optional, I like to use the Comic Sans MF font because its more pleasing to the eye than the Times or Romans stuff but feel free to do your own thing.

NGPL agreed to allow ENA to sell our NGPL storage gas to Oxy on February 7, 2002.  This gas sale was completed using 1) in-ground inventory transfers to Oxy at the various storage locations and 2) the release of ENA's storage contracts (i.e. K# 114786 & K# 114846) at the maximum rates beginning on February 7th through the end of each of the terms of the agreements.  I need your help on making sure everything is accounted for properly.  Going forward, this is what the NGPL NSS Storage invoices should look like:


K#114786 (18,283 Dth/d MDQ @ $3.07/Dth/mo through 4/30/02)

February 2002 Invoice of $56,128.81 will also show a credit of $44,100.97 for the capacity release to Oxy for February 7-28.  Net amount due NGPL is $12,027.84.
March 2002 Invoice of $56,128.81 will also show a credit of $56,128.81 for the capacity release to Oxy for March 1-31.  Net amount due NGPL is $0.00.
April 2002 Invoice of $56,128.81 will also show a credit of $56,128.81 for the capacity release to Oxy for April 1-30.  Net amount due NGPL is $0.00.
	
	
K#114846 (13,333 Dth/d MDQ @ $3.07/Dth/mo through 6/02/02)

February 2002 Invoice of $40,932.31 will also show a credit of $32,160.93 for the capacity release to Oxy for February 7-28.  Net amount due NGPL is $8,771.38.
March 2002 Invoice of $40,932.31 will also show a credit of $40,932.31 for the capacity release to Oxy for March 1-31.  Net amount due NGPL is $0.00.
April 2002 Invoice of $40,932.31 will also show a credit of $40,932.31 for the capacity release to Oxy for April 1-30.  Net amount due NGPL is $0.00.
May 2002 Invoice of $40,932.31 will also show a credit of $40,932.31 for the capacity release to Oxy for May 1-31.  Net amount due NGPL is $0.00.
June 2002 Invoice (Two Days) of $2,728.82 will also show a credit of $2,728.82 for the capacity release to Oxy for June 1-2.  Net amount due NGPL is $0.00.


Phil & Maria -- ENA's "Payment # 3 for NGPL Storage" will be revised to $20,798.81 and is due on March 19th or 20th.   The increase from our earlier estimate is due to taking a few more days to complete the Kinder Morgan Master Plan.

Kim & Chris -- Technically for February we should have put in Sitara tickets for the capacity release credit.  I told Kim just to put in the net amounts for Feb 02.  You get the same answer and it seems like a very simple solution.  Please get together and work out how the remaining months should be done.  Let me know what you decide.

Thanks for your help,

Ruth

Subject:	Possible Change to GRI Rates in Jan 2002

The Gas Research Institute has filed a proposal to revise the GRI surcharges from the level previously authorized in the 1998 Settlement.  GRI's filing has not been approved yet, but the Settlement provides for an adjustment under certain circumstances so there is a good chance it will be.  We will advise you of the outcome when FERC issues an order on GRI's proposal.  The new rates would still be below the current rates.  Both sets of rates are provided below for your convenience.



Rates (cents per Dth)	Current 2001	Settlement 2002	New Proposal 2002	
Commodity	0.7	0.5	0.55	
High Demand*	9.0	6.0	6.6	
Low Demand*	5.5	3.7	4.07	
Small Customer	1.1	0.8	0.88	
  				

*refers to high load factor or low load factor customers.

If FERC approves this proposal, the rates for 2003 will likely change from those in the Settlement as well.

Hey guys...

The file is now saved as a shared file. All the changes discussed in the meeting have been done.

The file is located O:/gas structuring/bankruptcy folder/transportation/Pipeline contact List

If you have any questions or problems with the file, let me know.

FYI...the breakout of the pipelines turned out pretty equitable.
	Chris 	17
	Robin	23
	Ruth	21
	Maria 	21

Robin/Chris - I will show you the format that I have been using to track the individual information for each pipeline after lunch. We can work on reformatting it, making changes or scrapping it and creating a new format - whatever works for the team.


Maria

Hey Rita..

Since the volume is so small and does match the amount listed in TXOK it is highly possible that this an error. I would say that we just need to correct are volumes to reflect the actuals Ruth provided, especially since I cannot identify where the original numbers on the spreadsheet first came from.

Phil...Chris any thoughts on the matter???

Thanks for the schedule Maria.  I don't know if it matters that much, but for the ENA storage on NGPL, the numbers are off a little according to the pipe statements and the email from Ruth on March 20th.  I show the volumes to be as follows:

NGPL - LA :  1,336,843
NGPL - TX:    758,666
NGPL - TXOK:  472
  Total          2,095,981

The difference from your schedule other than the distribution between points is the 472 which appears to be double counted.  Maybe my numbers are off, but just thought I'd mention it.  Let me know what you think.

Location:	MPC/Dry Creek Storage/2-02125-1

Rita, there is a storage contract 7010 in Unify for MPC.  I assume this is the contract that needs to be pathed in Unify to withdraw the storage gas.  Do you get any statements from MPC?

		o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy Folder/Transportation/(pipeline name)/Notes_(pipeline name).doc

		Example ==>  o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy Folder/Transportation/Tennessee/Notes_Tennessee.doc

	Since we are just starting the process on most of the pipelines, we will need to create new directories for most of the pipelines.

3.  At a minimum, put the date you are making the notes, I don't think the time is so important.  I put in the time when its conversation, I just put in the date when I spend a couple hours working on something.  Ha - me work a couple of hours!!

4.  Put your initials at the end of the note so we know who made it.

5.  When you put someone's name in the document, put their phone number and tell us who it is, at least the first time you mention their name if that person is not someone we all deal with.  usually this would be the person your are speaking with at the pipeline.  First person that comes to me and says "buy me a pop" gets $.60.

6.  Last and certainly optional, I like to use the Comic Sans MF font because its more pleasing to the eye than the Times or Romans stuff but feel free to do your own thing.

Chris,
I believe Hector Alatorre has told you about the letter of credit that is
needed.  I have attached the format for Transco.  If you have any questions
please let me know.  Thanks.

Here is a draft diagram that lays out my proposed Transportation Contract Evaluation Process.  I have tried to show the entire span of transportation and pipeline services contracts and how the decision-making would be completed.  Of course, the interruptible agreements would only be rejected/terminated after it was determined that they were no longer needed for commercial purposes.

Please view this diagram as a supplement to the Administrative Protocols that Mark Ellenberg is finishing up.  

What is the next step in getting this issue in front of the committee?

Ruth

Shemin,

I was reading in today's Gas Daily that FERC Chairman, Pat Wood, had an "open-mind" about extending the temporary waiver of ceilings on capacity release transactions past September 30, 2002.  The article also said that this is a different position than his earlier stance.  It also said that one of the Commissioners did not favor an extension because of the potential to contribute to price swings for gas.

Ruth
