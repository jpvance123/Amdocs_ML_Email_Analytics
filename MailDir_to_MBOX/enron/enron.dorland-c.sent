Anne,

I still haven't received any pay stubs since I have been in Houston. Can I 
get copies of those somehow? Could you send my something in the inter-company 
mail so I can see if my mail stop has been really been changed? I haven't 
received any mail of any kind which seems kind of weird. 

Thanx 

Chris Dorland

(P.S. thanx for the PRC info.)

I have never done a houseboating trip but they sound like a lot of fun. Was 
the weather good? Houston was hot. Very hot. I better get used to it though 
because I'm moving there. That is why I have been so crazy lately. I am going 
down there to trade power in the North East. Pretty crazy shit. I gotta hop 
but I'll write more later.

Chris

In response to this e-mail. The guy who had the party is Rob Milnthorp. He is 
the Pres. and CEO of Enron Canada. John Disturnall is our option trader. Jon 
Mckay runs Canadian trading and is my immediate boss.

I must have missed this one.

I have to run a bunch of errands today and pick up some decorations for my 
buddy's wedding this weekend so I can't go golfing. That sucks. It is so nice 
outside. Maybe I'll work up the energy to go for a run later. Probably not. I 
am such a lazy piece of shit lately. I am definately going to go running now. 
Self depreciation has motivated me. I need to buy some rollerblades. Where 
did you get yours? Cowan says that K2 are really good and relatively 
inexpensive. Any thoughts? Maybe I'll look for rollerblades when I'm out this 
afternoon. You should be proud of me. I was able to stay out of the bottle 
all weekend. Quite an accomplishment don't you think. One hour to go. Someone 
shoot me!

I'm done!

I have tied out positions as of June 6 trading. I have to set up the 
economics page but that shouldn't take long.

What about reversals from our currency book? Which way do the reversals from 
the other books go?

The cash deals aren't all in the model (June 1 - June 6) because the physical 
position doesn't balance but I will talk to Mike about that.

I can see a light at the end of the tunnel. Hopefully this makes things 
easier on you.

Thanx for all your hard work!

Chris

Congratulations!  For an unprecedented five years in a row, Enron has been 
ranked the "Most Innovative Company in America" by Fortune magazine.  In 
addition, for the first time, Enron has also been ranked #1 in "Quality of 
Management," topping General Electric and Omnicom Group, and our "Employee 
Talent" has been ranked #2, behind Goldman Sachs and ahead of Cisco 
Systems.   America's most admired management team is paired with the best and 
brightest employee talent.  That winning combination has led to Enron's 
five-year "Most Innovative" sweep.  The "Most Admired" list will appear in 
Fortune's Feb. 21 issue, available on newsstands Feb. 8.

You are the reason we have achieved such consistent recognition.  You bring 
the innovative ideas to Enron and create new business opportunities.  You 
contribute to our quality management team.  And you are the outstanding 
employee talent that makes Enron such an exciting and successful company.

Keep up your outstanding work, and we look forward to even greater 
achievements in 2000!

I do not suck at writing e-mails. You just can't appreciate the sense of 
humor one develops in my line of work. It's borderline madness. I should be

H town is good. Work is crazy but I like my new role. The weather is nice vs. 
snow in Cow town. How are things with you? Are you still commuting across the 
country? What is your buddy at William's name? Do you know what region he 
trades? Getting busy now better hop.

Keep in touch,

Varsity called and the water pump needs to be replaced. 

It is going to be $700. I told them to go ahead and fix it.

Hope that's OK.

Kevin,

October 2 sounds fine. I am going to try to be there earlier than that but I 
am sure I will be in and out of the office taking care of bullshit. Will the 
package they are sending include info. on movers? I want to book them as soon 
as possible.

Ricardo,

I will be joining the East power desk at the beginning of October and I am 
trying to get up to speed on the PJM market. Kevin Prestor thought you would 
be able to help me find some data. I am looking for the following historics 
in excel format (send as much data as you have and feel free to include 
anything else that you think might be relevant):

- Daily prices for PJM( West), Cinergy, NEPP, NYPP, TVA and ERCOT
- HDD's and CDD's for Philedelphia, Allentown Washington DC, Baltimore, 
Pittsburg, Newark, New York City, Cinncinati and any other cities that are 
relevant ?
- Supply outage data for PJM
- Daily Import / Exprot data for PJM
- Historic daily nat gas prices Transco Zone 6 ( NY and Non-NY), Chicago, ... 
???

Again, please feel free to make any suggestions. I am very new to the world 
of power and it is likely that I have overlooked something very obvious.

Thanx,

Chris Dorland

Torrey/Mark,

Below is the error message Chris gets when logging in to EOL. If we hit Yes 
it keeps coming back with the same error. (Sometimes it works though... you 
figure it out). If you hit No, the browser session freezes up.

We have done the following:

Uninstalled/Reinstalled Shockwave
Reinstalled browser


Please look at this ASAP since he needs to be able to see the customer screen.

Thanks,

Attila

I am 80% going to the rodeo on Thursday. It is the Enron customer party that 
day. As for Nashville North I don't know if we are going there or somewhere 
else after. I am a huge bed wetter when it comes to drinking on school 
nights. I likely won't be going out again until Friday or Saturday. Am I 
going to get an eye infection if I continue to wear your sunglasses around 
town? I hope not. Chicks dig me in those glasses.

I guess the question is whether the cost of pending lawsuits is priced into

The wedding was great! Too much fun. Once again I'm hung over on a monday. No 
great stories except that I nearly wiped out while walking down the aisle. I 
tripped on a cord to a video camera. Mildly embarrassing. My friend was a 
rock. I think I was more nervous than him. Ft. Mac is a total shit hole. On 
my tombstone it wil read " He went to Ft. MacMurray, once."  No Houston for 
me. Thank god. I have to go to a party at my boss's on Saturday. I think I 
might try to play golf as well. I will be taking it very easy. No more booze. 
My liver hurts.

Subject: Canada Intra-Month Currency Issues.

Jeremy,
In the last few months our intramonth books have seen very large swings in 
their P&L due simply to currency positions.  The traders want to be able to 
hedge this risk but the problem is that there are no reports in ERMS that 
meet their currency information requirements.

We need reports similar to those reports which we are able to produce for our 
term books

Crv Shift (Implicit)  - to show price curve shift by pub code
Curr Hedge   - to show currency curveshift by month
Implicit Position Report  - to show gas and USD positions by month
Top Page Canada  - to correctly bucket price curveshift verses currency 
curveshift

We need these reports to work for all of our intramonth books (physical, 
financial, gas daily).  

physical postids:  accued: 698871, MTM: 698872
financial postid:     698876
gas daily:   698877


All of these reports currently work for our term books (698669) but none of 
our intramonth books (there reports come out blank)

This issue  is of CRITICAL importance to us - our IM book is seeing 
SIGNIFICANT swings in p&l due to currency exposure.  We had originally asked 
for currency reports from you approx 6 months ago (requested by Walt).  We 
now need this ASAP.

The most important IM book which we need reports for is the IM financial book 
and the most important report we need in the Implicit Position Report.
I understand that this will take a considerable amout of your time but this 
is VERY important to the profitability of Enron Canada.  Please call be to 
dicuss a timeline.  

Kathy (403-974-6735)

Scott,

The ROM gas daily deal that I did with IM-Central-Transport on Friday appears 
to be booked backwards. The trader from Houston called me this morning.

The deal # is NB9860.1. Could you see that it is booked properly. 

Thanx,

Chris

I am sorry I was short with you on the phone. The gas market is a total shit 
show and our economics are out by $1M . I worked until midnight last night 
and I am very tired. We should buy an ice cream cake from DQ and cook some 
steaks on Saturday after golf. Danny and I can leave after dinner or first 
thing in the morning on Sunday. I hope your (and my) work week improves. See 
you tommorow!

Subject: Fortune Most Admired Ranking

Congratulations!  For an unprecedented five years in a row, Enron has been 
ranked the "Most Innovative Company in America" by Fortune magazine.  In 
addition, for the first time, Enron has also been ranked #1 in "Quality of 
Management," topping General Electric and Omnicom Group, and our "Employee 
Talent" has been ranked #2, behind Goldman Sachs and ahead of Cisco 
Systems.   America's most admired management team is paired with the best and 
brightest employee talent.  That winning combination has led to Enron's 
five-year "Most Innovative" sweep.  The "Most Admired" list will appear in 
Fortune's Feb. 21 issue, available on newsstands Feb. 8.

You are the reason we have achieved such consistent recognition.  You bring 
the innovative ideas to Enron and create new business opportunities.  You 
contribute to our quality management team.  And you are the outstanding 
employee talent that makes Enron such an exciting and successful company.

Keep up your outstanding work, and we look forward to even greater 
achievements in 2000!

How's it going? Did you have a good time in Victoria? I have been running 
around like a chicken with my head cut off trying to get ready to move. Went 
to Red Deer this weekend and played a little golf. Pretty relaxing. I have so 
much shit to do. I better hop.

Kerri,

This is a test. If you receive this message I correctly wrote down your 
e-mail address. 

How was your birthday? Were you reasonably well behaved? How is your week 
shaping up? We should grab a coffee one night soon.

Give me a call or w/b

Nav,

How are you doing? What are you doing? I am still working for Enron. I have 
been trading nat gas for about 3 years. I am moving to Houston at the end of 
the month. In my next life I am going to be trading electricity in the NE US. 
Should be interesting. Crazy volatility. I will probably have a heart attack 
at 26 but that's life. Hope things are going well for you.

Kim,

Can you contact Mikie Rath regarding my 401K plan. I haven't received 
anything from Northern Trust and would like to get set up. I would like begin 
contributing as soon as possible. 

Thanx,

Chris

(PS The way it was explained to me the $10 500 / annum contribution limit is 
only for personal contributions and does not include company matching, is 
this correct?)

I talked to Keith Holst who went through this process a couple of years ago 
and he said that a lady named Janice Priddy in Houston set up the paperwork 
for him.

I am organizing a bachelor party and am interested in information on group 
rates and facility availability. 

Our group will require 5-7 tee times, dinner and cocktails. I am hoping to 
book for one of the following Saturdays:

June 24, 2000
July 8, 2000
July 15, 2000
July 22, 2000

Information on transportation to Red Deer would also be appreciated.


Thank you!

Brad,

Can you change my address in your system (and with fund companies) to my mom 
and dad's address. I haven't heard from this nurse yet and I am leaving next 
week. Please be sure to let me know if any of that Clarica transfer doesn't 
go smoothly.

Thanx,

Chris

This file contains a list of FX swaps that need to be transfered from Lavo's 
currency book to our new currency book. 

Once the deals have been transferred the corresponding annuities need to be 
killed from Lavo's and our financial books.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanx,

Chris

Margaret,

Thank you for all you help getting my Visa application prepared. Do you know 
what documentation I need to have with me at the border? I was planning on 
bringing the following:

Passport
Driver's License
Birth Certificate
University Transcripts

Is there anything else that I need to bring?

Some of my questions. 

What is the difference between the 401K plan and savings plan?

How much does Enron contribute / match for each plan?

What is the max. annual 401k contribution?

Thanx,

Chris

Jill,

All is well in Houston. Finally getting settled in. Work is crazy. Trading 
power is not for the faint of heart. This is susposed to be the quiet season 
and I can't believe the volatility. How are things with you? All is well I 
trust. I will have to come for a visit some time to escape the Houston heat. 
Better go but keep in touch!

Dad,

When are you buying mom a new Jeep? I need to sell my truck and do it fast. I 
was thinking I could trade it in towards mom's new one and that might be the 
best way to get at least decent money for it. Just a thought.

How was your holiday? You missed some beautiful weather. My best friend's 
stag was on saturday and I still feel like shit. I guess I deserve it for 
drinking 200 beers. From what I recall I had a good time though. Tonight I am 
going to bed at 8pm. I can't wait.

Morgan,

Heard through Bugg your in SF now. You should rethink coming up to Kelowna 
for May long. 

Thinking of going to the bay area to visit some friends sometime soon. Send 
me your number and I'll give you a call. 

Any good stock ideas? Check out MSIA on the Nasdaq OTC board. This could be a 
Qualcomm.

Gotta hop,

Chris Dorland

Dale,

The short description for the above product should read CAN Gas Swap Nit 
Daily as opposed to Can Gas Swap Nit Monthly. 

I don't know why the description changed from when I set it up. Would it be 
easier for me to set up another product and kill this one?

Let me know.

Thanx,

Chris

"Mr. Launer's tip for investors who don't have the time to do exhaustive
research: Look for companies such as Enron and El Paso whose stocks are
trading at price-earnings multiples that are lower than their long-term growth
rates."

The one thing that scares me about Enron is the P/E, regardless of earnings 
growth. Our earnings growth has been so strong it is like a treadmill that 
keeps getting faster and faster. At some point you fall on your ass. That 
being said, I have never sold a share of Enron stock or exercised an option. 
We always seem to find ways to reinvent ourselves and make money appear from 
nowhere. Investment in Enron should be treated with the same caution as 
investing in Cisco or any other new economy stock that challenges traditional 
valuation methods.

How are things going? Learning lots? Went to the rodeo and then to Nashville 
North yesterday so feeling a little fuzzy today. I'm not doing anything today 
but tommorow I am going to the rodeo and then to a big industry party so that 
should be good for a headache. Friday I'm going to the Chick Wagon party and 
Saturday to Nashville North with the boys. Weather has been good and looks 
like that will continue. Did you find a gym yet?

Mike,

Hope you found a great place to live. It is ridiculous how expensive flats 
are in London. Thank god your making pounds now.

Tahoe was too much traveling for that short of a stay.  Good weather, good 
friends, beautiful scenery, all right snowboarding, shitty food, cheesy 
casinos and too much time in fucking airports. That about summarizes the 
weekend. 

Laird is doing fine. Things have been relatively slow and the market is very 
choppy. I've been pretty quiet. No major axes to grind. Just trying to look 
for the next big trade and keep from getting my head ripped off on EOL.

You have to go out for Middle Eastern food. Go to The Lebanese Restaurant. I 
think it is on Oxford street but I'll find out for sure. Also try Ranoush 
Juice for a falafel.

Good luck and keep in touch!

Chris

Dawn,

How long does it usually take Blue Cross to refund $ for the flexible 
spending account? I sent in a claim form a month ago and haven't seen 
anything yet. The reason I'm concerned is that when my brother moved he did a 
change of address and my mail has been screwed up ever since.

Thanx,

Chris

Hello to the Houston Gang,

I was mistakenly posted as a reviewer for Ricardo Perez. Either Chris is  
trying to pass himself off as his charming younger brother again or IT has 
messed up our emails on the PEP system.  Please contact IT support:

Things are crazy. I still don't have a moving date or work visa but every one 
assures me I have lots of time. I would go to a store like future shop or 
look on the internet at chapters.ca. All electronics / stereo shops have them 
now. Make sure you get one with lots of memory. Take it easy.

Kerrie,

This is a test. If you receive this message I correctly wrote down your
e-mail address.

How was your birthday? Were you reasonably well behaved? How is your week
shaping up? We should grab a coffee one night.

Give me a call or w/b

Do you have any plans for July 29th? If not, would you like to come to Ryan's 
stag? You could play golf with Darryl Brown, Ryan's dad and their friend Dave.
I think those guys are going to play golf and then come to dinner afterwards. 
Let me know either way.

Hi Andrew!

How are things in London? I am talking to MH right now and he says you are 
getting a little tired of school. I don't blame you one bit.

I need a vacation. I bet you do to. What do you say to a little Amsterdam 
trip in April? I think we deserve it. 

What do you think of MH changing companies? I think he should get out of that 
business altogether. He will hate NB just as much as ML inside 6 months.

Take care,

Chris

Do you have a name and/or phone number of someone? I also don't know what 
information I need to have in order to exercise. Could you give me a call 
(x6910) and help me out. 

Thanx,

Mike,

Good to hear you arrived safely. Reno was very average. Too much travel. I 
guess you know all about that.

Hope that work is going well. I am trying to take it relatively easy on Rob.  
Benson's email is Rob.Benson@enron.com, if that doesn't work try

Robert.Benson@enron.com. Let me know if those don't work.

Gotta hop! 

Keep in touch,

Chris

The stag was a total monkey show. We played golf and pool, ate some dinner, 
took in the ballet and the hit the bars. I did manage to get a couple of 
rounds of golf in between all the drinking. I actually played pretty good. 
Houseboating sounds like fun. I've never done that. I am so on the wagon. I 
can't express to you how little I'm going to drink this weekend. Lots of 
golf.

Yo Mama`s so fat ....



Your mama is so fat:
When she hauls ass she has to make two trips.
When she dances she makes the band skip.
When she was diagnosed with the flesh eating disease the doctor gave her

13 years to live.

She puts mayonnaise on aspirin. (<- clearly the winner)
Her cereal bowl came with a lifeguard.
When she goes to the zoo the elephants throw her peanuts.
Her high school graduation picture was an aerial photograph.
Her driver`s license says "Picture continued on other side."
She has to iron her pants on the driveway.
The back of her neck looks like a pack of hot dogs.
Yo mama`s so fat, all the restaurants in town have signs that say:
"Maximum Occupancy: 240 Patrons OR Yo Mama"
Yo mama`s so fat, when she ran away, they had to use all four sides of
the milk carton.
Yo mama`s so fat, instead of Levis 501 jeans, she wears Levi`s 1002`s.
Yo mama`s so fat, when she gets in an elevator, it HAS to go down.
Yo mama`s so fat, she was born with a silver shovel in her mouth.
Yo mama`s so fat, she`s got smaller fat women orbiting around her.
Yo mama`s so fat, she could sell shade.

According to the people at the PEP help desk I don't exist. Maybe that's why 
I don't get mail or paystubs?

Scott,

I think your EOL report was incorrect regarding the Henry Hub gas daily deals 
from Mar.28th.

Mike and I had a total of 3 sales at 2.945

2 done by Mike

EOL ID #'s
132116
132569

and 1 done by me

EOL ID #
132967

The trade I did was done late in the day and you might have missed it.

We added the deal back to our model. 

Let me know if there are any problems.

Chris

Dianne,

I didn't get my spreadsheet from Friday. No biggie I just used the average of 
my buy and sell from stack manager in my model but I would like to have the 
actual deals.

Thanx,

We are going to have a meeting to discuss S/D in Alberta and the west 
Wednesday at 3:30 in the computer training room downstairs. The focus of the 
meeting will be to fine tune our very rough summer forecast for the "X" (NWP 
Sumas to La Plata B and PGT Kingsgate to Malin).

Everyone is welcome. Free hotdogs and donuts for the first 100 customers! 
Bring the kids, we've got fun for the whole family.

Lloyd,

I would like Ricardo and I to sit down with Kevin and go over how our PJM 
load forecast model works. I want to use it, or a version of it, for day to 
day sensitivity analysis. I haven't met Kevin yet so if you could mention 
this to him I would appreciate it. I would also like to sit down with you 
some time this week to talk about PJM fundamentals and co-ordinating our 
analytical efforts. I want to get a feel for what we have done and set some 
goals as to what needs to be done. Let me know if one afternoon this week 
works for you. 

Thanx,

Chris Dorland

It is a 1997 Grand Cherokee Laredo, 55 000 km's, V8 loaded. I think it is

The have Mike's Hard and stuff like that. I generally never go out during the

hangovers. I'm not going to the rodeo on Friday but I am going to the chucks 
that night. Tonight I rest.

Lon,

The last couple of days the April basis market on our morning sheet has been 
the financial curve rather than the physical.

We should use the physical curve for the prompt month comparison analysis as 
it is more relevant as the index gets set.

Thanx,

Chris

Subject: Your Chapters.ca Coupons ...



Dear Chapters Customer,

Included in this e-mail is the electronic coupon we told you about during 
your recent visit to Chapters.ca.
By following the steps listed below, you will be able to receive $5 off your 
next purchase on the site!
A $10 minimum order amount before tax and shipping applies to this offer.

Your coupon number is:

ETYLE618IG636980185

?  First, return to www.chapters.ca
?  Select your title(s) by adding them to your Chapters.ca Shopping Bag.
?  When you're ready to pay for your order, go to the Shopping Bag page.
?  On this page, you'll find a space for your coupon number.
?  Enter your coupon number here, then click "Checkout".
?  On the next page (the Order Summary), you'll see that your $5 coupon will 
be applied to your purchase.
?  Click "Purchase" to complete your order.
?  Minimum purchase of $10 applies (minimum amount refers to order sub-total).

Before redeeming your coupon, please read
the following carefully:

1. These coupons expire on the earlier of either midnight
on September 30, 2000 or the date Chapters Online terminates the offer,
whichever comes sooner. Limit of one coupon per customer.

2. Chapters.ca coupons can only be redeemed with orders
placed through the checkout process. Coupons cannot be redeemed
with QUICK BUY orders.

3. Chapters.ca coupons do not have a cash value and can
only be redeemed on this Web site. These vouchers will not be
accepted at any Chapters, Coles or SmithBooks  stores.

4. You can redeem only one coupon per order. You cannot combine
the value of several coupons for use with one order. Chapters.ca
coupons are worth the amount indicated upon delivery to you.

5. Only the person to whom the coupon was issued (the person
who received the coupon by e-mail), can redeem it. At present,
coupons are non-transferable.

6. The order is free if the value of your purchase - including
shipping - is less than the value of the coupon. No cash back,
refund or "change" is given for a redeemed coupon.

7. In the case of a multiple-item order, the value of the coupon
is applied against the title or titles which can be shipped
immediately.  Any remaining coupon value is then deducted from the total
of the back-ordered items.  If a back-ordered book is unavailable, a new
coupon equal to the redeeming value of the original coupon can be issued to 
you.
Please e-mail us at info@chapters.ca for details.


If you have any questions about redeeming your coupons,
please send an e-mail to promotions@Chapters.ca.


Thank you for visiting Chapters.ca!

Attached is a forecast for the rest of the summer for the X (NWP and PGT).

We should try to have a conference call with the west desk to discuss as soon 
as we can.

I am wondering if you know which moving company Enron uses to move people to 
Houston. Despite the fact that I haven't seen the formal offer I think I 
should book a  mover so I don't get stuck. Let me know if you know or if 
there is someone in Houston I should talk to (Jennifer?). 

Thanx,

Chris

Brad,

I don't know if you've heard but I am moving to Houston at the end of 
September. I need to know how much I have contributed to my RRSP through you 
this year so I can maximize my annual contributions before I go. Can you 
figure this out and let me know. 

Thanx,

When you download MP3 files you should download them in 128 kps format. That 
is CD quality sound and you can get about 30 minutes of music on 32MB of 
memory on an MP3 player. You can sort by that format on Napster.

Hey buddy,

 What were you doing in Mexico?  Must have been really nice!  As far
as tomorrow is concerned, I think that we may have a few drinks before the
club scene, so you are more than welcome to stop over for a few. I would love
to introduce you to some of my "single" friends.  Actually, pretty much all
of them are single right now. (Teehee). Anyhow, I imagine that we will begin
at about 8 or so, hope to see ya there. I live in Marda Loop in the SW. It's
just off off Crowchild. My address is #2, 2106, 35th ave SW. Exit onto 33rd,
and it's easy from there. If you have any ques'ns, call me @ 249-1571.
Depending on which way you come, it is really easy to find. You can also get
there by 14th, or 17th, but in either case, you will still turn onto 33rd.
Talk to you soon!
T

Mine has 32 MB. You need way more that that. You can buy memory cards for

Margaret,

Just wondering how my Visa was coming along? I had a confusing conversation 
with Jeanne in relocation services this morning. The way I understand the 
moving process is that my household goods have to leave Canada at the same 
time or after I leave the country. She seemed to think that I had to go to 
the US and then return to Canada before my goods could leave Canada. Can you 
shed some light on this?

Thanx,

Chris Dorland

Mike,

How are things going? I trust that you are adjusting relatively easily. 

Things have been relatively quiet lately. Doing a little snowboarding and 
watching lots of movies. Trying to drag my lazy ass to the gym at least 4 
days a week. So far I'm at one in a row. Things are looking good for a repeat 
today.

Laird popped by today and brought us some lattes and saw the office. For all 
your hard work we are actually getting some term business done with Optimum 
now.
I think Lambie helped them out there.

Take care,

Chris

I don't know if Dan wants to play on Saturday, I forgot to ask. Is there room

If no, I will probably try to get a game with Brad and Darren Easy on Sunday.

No problem.

The walk to work in the snow was invigorating at 6:45. Just kidding, it 
wasn't that bad.

Big news around here today. Lavo is moving to Houston.

Enron Teams With  Compaq to Provide Capacity for One Million Simultaneous 
Broadband Streams of  Windows Media Player
10:55 EDT Monday, April 10, 2000

    HOUSTON, April 10 /PRNewswire/ -- Enron Broadband Services, Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) and a leader in the delivery of
high bandwidth applications, announced today an alliance with Compaq, the
largest supplier of computer systems in the world, to enable Microsoft Windows
Media solutions over Enron's fiber optic high-bandwidth network.
    With this agreement, the Enron Intelligent Network(TM) and distributed
Compaq ProLiant servers will provide unprecedented levels of performance and
quality of service for Windows Media applications.  The Enron Intelligent
Network offers high quality of service, reliability and network control for
the delivery of TV-quality streaming video to the fastest growing media
customer base -- broadband Internet users.
    Enron and Compaq have teamed to make this breakthrough in video quality
easy for broadcasters and content providers to enhance the Internet experience
for their customers.  In live demonstrations this week at the National
Association of Broadcasters' show in Las Vegas, NAB 2000, the companies will
showcase how their combined technologies make this possible.
    Enron's video streaming services and the Enron Intelligent Network
optimize Media Player for broadband content, and Enron has selected Compaq as
the preferred platform for Windows Media Server.  As a part of Compaq's
NonStop(TM) eBusiness solutions strategy, Compaq Professional Services is
partnering with Enron to provide a wide range of systems integration services
in conjunction with the newly formed alliance.
    "We are pushing the technology envelope and setting new standards daily,"
said Joe Hirko, CEO of Enron Broadband Services.  "To ensure a highly
reliable, scalable, industrial-strength network on an ongoing basis, Enron's
distributed infrastructure design is continually evolving.  This requires a
regimen of testing and benchmarking.  Compaq has been an invaluable, trusted
partner in helping us further extend Enron's multiplatform capabilities."
    Compaq and Enron engineering teams worked together to simulate the high
volume loads of a live streaming media web event with as many as 10,000 users
streaming broadband Windows Media from a single ProLiant server farm.  They
then translated the results into the Compaq architecture and system design for
Enron's network and collaborated on product testing, quality control and
deployment.
    "Broadband applications are here now and represent a rapidly growing
requirement from Compaq's service provider and enterprise customers," said
Ashok Shah, Vice President North America, Compaq Professional Services.  "We
are pleased to be working with Enron on next generation broadband application
design and delivery in media and entertainment, as well as in areas such as
distance learning, health care and multimedia customer centers.  Enron is an
important reference to our 27,000 Compaq services professionals as we provide
technology leadership and expertise to our client engagements."
    Enron and Compaq will work together to implement Microsoft Windows 
2000internally as well as in product development for future product 
iterations.
The two organizations will collaborate on the development of strategy and best
practices for large-scale, high-volume Windows Media applications and
deployments for service providers and enterprise customers.  Additionally,
Enron will team with Compaq to provide high-bandwidth capability for Compaq
customers.

Kramer,

How are things going? We are thinking of coming to SF on a golf / party trip 
sometime in the  next few months.

Things in Calgary are relatively unchanged. No chicks. Work is going great. 
Cowan and I are trading Alberta and having a great time. 

Poker and buying electronics have become the hobbies of choice around here. I 
am terrible at poker but good at buying electronics.

Take it easy and w/b,

Dorland

Kim,

I received the benefit book and will look through it tonight. Do you know the 
name of the lady I am susposed to be in contact with at Enron relocation 
services? She called me yesterday but I have forgotten her name. I am 
wondering if I need to have my visa done before she will book the movers. In 
regards to my visa, I have gathered pretty much all the info. that Margaret 
needs with the exception of University transcripts. I had to order those and 
probably won't get them untill early next week.

Thank you for all your help!

Subject: Market Opening Dates

Hey Chris,

I am doing some research on historical prices in surrounding power markets 
and I am trying to determine the wholesale market-opening dates for NE power 
markets. I am also interested in dates when locational marginal pricing (LMP) 
was implemented (if at all).

I was able to get dates for every market but Cinergy and ECAR. Please let me 
know if you can tell me who to contact, and/or if someone in Houston can dig 
this up for me.

I don't mean to be a burden, but Jeff Borg was hoping I could come up with 
this for a 3:00pm meeting today.

Thanks bro,

Dan

Ryan,

Good to hear things are going well. I am still with Enron but I am in the 
process of moving to Houston. I'm going down there to trade electricity so 
that should be interesting change from nat gas. No wife. No house. No liver. 
That's about it. Hope India was a good time. 

Keep in touch!

Yo Mama`s so fat ....



Your mama is so fat:
When she hauls ass she has to make two trips.
When she dances she makes the band skip.
When she was diagnosed with the flesh eating disease the doctor gave her

13 years to live.

She puts mayonnaise on aspirin. (<- clearly the winner)
Her cereal bowl came with a lifeguard.
When she goes to the zoo the elephants throw her peanuts.
Her high school graduation picture was an aerial photograph.
Her driver`s license says "Picture continued on other side."
She has to iron her pants on the driveway.
The back of her neck looks like a pack of hot dogs.
Yo mama`s so fat, all the restaurants in town have signs that say:
"Maximum Occupancy: 240 Patrons OR Yo Mama"
Yo mama`s so fat, when she ran away, they had to use all four sides of
the milk carton.
Yo mama`s so fat, instead of Levis 501 jeans, she wears Levi`s 1002`s.
Yo mama`s so fat, when she gets in an elevator, it HAS to go down.
Yo mama`s so fat, she was born with a silver shovel in her mouth.
Yo mama`s so fat, she`s got smaller fat women orbiting around her.
Yo mama`s so fat, she could sell shade.

I will be moving to Houston by the end of the month. I am actually going to 
be trading electricity so that should be an interesting change from nat gas.
We will have to hook up once I get settled. How much longer are you going to 
be in Boston? How far is Dallas from Houston? 

Keep in touch!

I made it home. The flight was OK. Shitty movies.

I am very tired today. Tough getting going this morning.

Better get going. Enjoy the rest of your vacation.

I was not hung over yesterday. I had 3 beers and went home. How about that 
for self control? I watched women's gymnastics olympic trials on saturday 
night and did some laundry. What a loser I am. I am going to Sylvan this 
weekend. My friend Meghan is moving to Sydney Australia and Saturday is her 
going away party. Meg's cabin parties are  generally epic gong shows. I need 
to rest up this week. I bought in-line pants at the Gap yesterday. Now if I 
get some rollerblades I'll have the official pants. I don't think you need to 
take your rollerblades in to get the wheels rotated every week. Can't you do 
it yourself? I could probably even do it and I'm the most mechanically inept 
person in the world.

Kathy,

Could we sit down for about a half an hour this afternoon. I Have some 
questions about how our new FX book is going to work and how to transfer 
current positions into this book.

Let me know when you have a few minutes ( any time after 2pm).

FX is a total fucking mess in Calgary. I have actually thought about the 
problems a little bit. Call me if you want to talk about specifics (x3-1663). 
Things in Houston are good. The weather is great now. Year round golf is 
nice. Power is a total shit show. The volatility is crazy and this is the off 
season. I need to get rested up for the summer. Take it easy

I was wondering if you sent my visa documents yesterday or today. I will be 
out of the office this afternoon but I would come back if my visa documents 
are going to me here.

Thanx,

I was wondering why I wasn't getting any mail. Could  you please send me that 
stuff through intercompany mail. I need to pay that insurance bill soon. If 
they can't straighten it out I'll send you your mail a couple times a week 
through inter-company mail.

Peace out!

Can you come and see me when you get in. We need to do more to tie out the 
risk in our physical book than agree on the number of molecules we are long 
or short. My model breaks out the positions by every type of risk profile. We 
need to produce a report from the Intra-month book that we can use to tie 
out. If that doesn't exist we should talk systems about creating it. 
Hopefully this will prevent any future blow ups.

Thanx,

Chris

Just thought I'd send a quick note to keep in touch and let you know what
I've been up to.  This is a picture from one of my first assignments in
March of last year during spring break in Panama City Fl.  The nice young
lady in the picture is, along with all of the other "competitors", wearing a
BIGWORDS T-Shirt.  Wilson, I'll defer to Grump for a joke.

My next assignment is the national cheerleading championships in Orlando Fl
in two weeks.

Hope everything is going well for you guys,
Talk to you later.

Kathy,

I have not forgot about that.  Currently I am working on another 
project(development of a program which will allow automating the process of 
copying multiple postids and update the related info (such as dates and 
expert clause in port_calc) so that user won't have to do that manually on a 
daily basis). 

I'll get back to the report issues after I am done with that.

BinBin,
I am having trouble running new calc's in the test environment.  I want to 
run the implicit position report for our entire book and see how it compares 
to our excel models (post id 834931/836743/839620... anyone will to).  The 
reports I print in Stage are always blank.  I can run calc's using the 
implcit command but I can not print reports on the new postid.

The top page request in an old request but the expicit report request is a 
new one.  I need to be able to look at the positions this way as well as the 
implicit way.

Kathy

Kathy,

The port_calc  version you have now when run from the port_calc screen in the 
egsstage environment doesn't include the changes for the "Implicit reports" 
related functionalities. This is because the current setup is for a testing 
version which is being used by the Houston currently.

To solve this problem, we have just put a run script : 
/home/kreeve/port_calc/run_implcit in your directory: /home/kreeve/port_cal.

For the testing, cd to /home/kreeve/port_cal,  then run the script:  
run_implcit  postid (you need to set up a postid for the test run).

To get the reports, you can still use the port_calc screen brought up in the 
egsstage environment (you can bring it up by typing: runmt on the command 
line)

postid 747584 is still available in the production environment, to run the 
test version of port_calc in egsstage, you need to have a data set in the 
egsstage database.


By the way, Are the issues you attatched in the reports(explici report and 
top page report) new requests ?

Please see the attached issues regarding the reports.


Also, under esggsate I can not seem to bring up only old calc's (including 
747584), in order to copy/amend them.  I need to test other types of deals so 
I need to be able to bring things up postid's in portcalc.  Any ideas what 
might be wrong?  Note that I can print reports from the reportscreen.

Back from Mexico. It was a much needed rest. Saturday sounds great but I

Tasha.

Good to hear from you. I have been quite busy. I am out of town all of next 
week but we should get together some time.
In terms of careers I don't have much in the way of ideas. Have you thiught 
about sales of some sort. I think you would be good at that. Not necessarily 
business to consumer sales but perhaps business to business sales. Just a 
thought.

Hey Dad and Chris,

How's it going? I was just wondering if I could ask for you and mom's help on 
a few things before the end of the summer. First, I want to start advertising 
my Jeep for sale, so I was hoping you might spruce it up a bit for me. It 
just needs a good cleaning inside and out (i.e. Lazerwash) before getting its 
picture taken for the ads. Also, the sticker on the rear window should be 
removed and it probably wouldn't hurt to have it Mr. Lubed one more time.

There are a couple of other things, but I think you said not to worry about 
them: Windshield is very cracked and tint on back window has a scrape on it. 
Don't worry about $$$ because whatever it costs you, I'll reimburse you from 
the proceeds.

I was thinking I'll list it in the Red Deer and Calgary Auto/Canada Trader 
magazines. If you call them, they set up an appointment with you to take a 
picture and get the vehicle listed. I have their phone numbers in both Red 
Deer (346-1969) and Cowtown (250-2122), but I think we should get the surfing 
machine tuned up first.

Second, I was hoping I could get a few things sent out here asap. As I 
mentioned before, I want to get involved in some adventurous stuff on the 
weekends, if possible. I found that I can take my Advanced PADI scuba here in 
one weekend, so I was hoping to get my fins, mask, snorkel and booties sent 
out here. I think they are in the basement. 

I would also love to get that box of movies from Chris and my golf 
clubs/shoes, si possible. Don't worry about the golf clubs if they are a 
hastle though b/c I probably wouldn't use them more than once or twice.

I hope this is not a big inconvenience to you guys. I just wanted to get the 
ball rolling on this before the summer's end.

Thanks alot and I'll talk to you soon,

Dan

Did you notice the stock market is a little lower today. The fucking nasdaq 
is down 10 % today and the dow  was down almost 5% at one point. The TSE was 
down 770 to 8880 at one point. I think that a lot of margin positions got 
squeezed out of teck length. I say buy the solid stocks CSCO, LU , MSFT, ENE 
all look great.

Good to hear from you. I won't be needing my blubber where I am. I moved to 
Houston at the end of September. Things here are good. I'm trading

I never did make it to Toronto this summer. Hope things are going well for

Subject: NGTL Linepack Purchase - Jan 17 to 25



Chris,

The purchase agreement is on its way over today but I would like to
confirm our plans.  NGTL will buy 50 Tj per day from Enron January 17 to
24, and 15 Tj on January 25 to complete the purchase for a total of 415
Tj.  We are flexible but I need like to lay out a schedule in advance.

Have a good week-end and feel free to call me (541-4726) if there are
any questions.

I accidentally entered a X-Alta storage deal twice on Friday. I have already 
taken it out of our model it now needs to be killed in Tagg and Sitara.

The Tagg deal # is NE4430.

Let me know if there are any problems.

Thanx,

Chris

Paul,

I would like the following data (and anything else you can think of):

Daily Power Prices

- PJM West / East (Others?)
- NYPP  
- Cinergy
-TVA
- any other markets that you think are relevant

Temperatures (Max, Min, Mean)

- Philadelphia
- Allentown
- Pittsburg
- Washington DC
- Newark
- Baltimore
- NYC

Gas Prices

- Transco Zone 6 Non- NY and NY
- What other pipes are close to the above cities? 

Supply (Generation)

- Any information you have on generation in PJM (by plant) including:
 - Fuel type
 - Capacity (typical production vs. maximum production)
 - Efficiency (heat rates) / Marginal production costs 
 - Historic outages
 - Forecast Outages
 - Who owns / operates the facilities?
 - Reserves ?
(I am trying to understand what the supply curve for PJM looks like but I am 
not sure if I am asking the correct questions. What parts of the puzzle am I 
missing?)

Demand (Load)

- Historic load information for PJM

Interchanges

- What are the historic imports and exports in and out of PJM
- What are the costs associated with wheeling power in and out of PJM ? 


Thank you for all your help and please include any other info. you think may 
be relevant.

Kramer, 

Cowan is trading Alberta cash and I'm trading the front of the curve. Lavo 
still trades the term in Alberta but is never around. As for Benny, after an 
unfortunate incident at September's craw fish boil, he has moved to Houston 
to trade power. No shit! 

Drop me a line with a number where you can be reached. I have an idea, like 
everyone else in the world, for an internet start up and want to pick your 
brain about the process of doing a business plan, getting VC $'s and such. I 
don't know if you know much about that stuff but your thoughts would be 
greatly appreciated. I have a friend in the Internet group at Goldman Sach's 
and I've talked to him about it but I want insight from someone inside the 
industry.

There is a revolution going on and I think I am the only one not getting rich 
off of it. 

Check out enron stock (ENE). We announced an alliance with Sun Microsystems 
to build a bandwidth network and the stock has doubled in a month. Not bad 
for a small Texas pipeline company. You would need a sand blaster to get the 
smile off of Lavorato's face. However I don't think I'm going to retire on my 
Enron options any time soon.

Gotta hop!

Dorland

(PS You should send Wilson a Bigwords t-shirt. The Jannon's would do the logo 
justice.)

I never get any good jokes which is why I haven't been sharing any. I am 
having a shitting week. Sick and tired. I can't wait for the weekend. I am 
going to sleep and golf. Where are you going on vacation? There aren't many 
weekends left in the summer and that sucks! Out of the weekends that are left 
I have two weddings and one stag, a trip to Houston and a trip to Toronto. I 
am never going to play any golf.

How's your day going?

Have a look in your humidor tonight. I brought you 13 Monte Cristo #4's ( I 
got a great deal). 

When I put them in there I noticed that you humidor seemed a little dry you 
might want to fill it up.

2 1/2 weeks to Mexico.

No not yet. You need to really think about this because things will move very

What questions? I accidentally deleted your e-mail from yesterday and don't 
remember any questions. I hadn't seen the jokes before but they were pretty 
funny. The sports ones were pretty good. The others were pretty tasteless, so 
they were my favorites. I feel much better today. I'm already getting psyched 
up for the weekend. I am going to play golf and not drink. I hate alcohol. I 
am on the wagon. For good this time. At least for a week anyway.

Chris

Just thought I'd send a quick note to keep in touch and let you know what
I've been up to.  This is a picture from one of my first assignments in
March of last year during spring break in Panama City Fl.  The nice young
lady in the picture is, along with all of the other "competitors", wearing a
BIGWORDS T-Shirt.  Wilson, I'll defer to Grump for a joke.

My next assignment is the national cheerleading championships in Orlando Fl
in two weeks.

Hope everything is going well for you guys,
Talk to you later.

Have you ever been to a movie on a Tuesday? I can afford the extra $4 to sit 
in a theater that isn't totally packed with 14 year old kids. The Klumps 
starts at 7:15 at Eau Claire. How does that sound? My friend's wedding is in 
Ft. Mac. That is why I'm going there on thursday.

How are you doing? Did you have a good stampede? I had a great stampede but 
got a nasty cold. Work is going good. Do you know Ryan Flemming? He went to 
Riverglen and is a pretty good friend of mine. Anyway, he is getting married 
August 12 so I've been pretty busy organizing his stag and getting ready for 
his wedding. Went to Red Deer this weekend and saw my parents. Did you know 
my brother moved to Toronto? I need to find a smaller place but for now I'm 
staying in Kensington. That is all that is new in my life. We should hit a 
patio and have a drink one night. 

Take it easy,

Chris

Subject: New USERID

Chris,

We have set up a new USERID for you which has all of the same trading rights 
as the old one and is working fine down here. The USERID is ADM40092 and the 
default password on it is "WELCOME6". Just let me know if you have any 
trouble at all with it in the morning. In the meantime, Mark Dilworth and Jay 
Webb are still looking over the old USERID to see what exactly is happening 
with it.

Torrey

Jay,

I can't seem to suspend my product without hitting the stop sign with the 
hand on it. The red stop light isn't showing up and when I right click on the 
product the suspend product option is faded and I can't select it. How can I 
fix this? Let me know. 

Thanx,

Chris Dorland

Howdie,

What's the new job? I'm good for sushi any day next week (Tues-Fri). Give me 
a call or e-mail me. 

I'm off to Kimberly snowboarding this weekend. I've done some good 
snowboarding trips lately (Lake Tahoe and Fernie).

Not making big $$$$$ lately but things are looking up. Going to Santa Fe 
grill for lunch (mmmm!).

You need to come check out my new home theater system, it's crazy!

See you next week,

Chris

Kim,

Could you please explain (pretent you are talking to a 4 year old) the 
details of the following.

a) Health care coverage provided by Enron and any costs associated with that 
coverage including:
 - Medical
 - Dental
 - Vision
Is this enough coverage? Is there supplemental coverage available? What is / 
is not covered? 

b) Life / Accidental Death and Dismemberment / Disability Insurance 

  - What (if any) is provided coverage?

c) What programs concerning retirement saving (company matched savings, 
pension benefits ect...) will I participate in?

 - What are these programs? 
 - How do I sign up?

d) I am told I should opt out of social security. How does that work?

e) What is my vacation allocation? How do unused vacation day work in the US? 

f) In Canada, we have a "Health Spending Account" of $1000 / year that we can 
allocate towards eye glasses, health club memberships ect...
 
 - Does a similar program exist in the US?

g) I will be required to file 2 tax returns (Canada and US) in 2000. Will 
Enron cover the cost of having those returns prepared?

h) Is parking at the Allen Center covered in the offer? If not, could it be? 

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.

Chris Dorland

I am starting to wade through it. The US health care system is very different 
from the Canadian but the Enron coverage seems quite comprehensive.

Is that Microwave that you gave Dan really expensive? 

All the guys at work are saying I shouldn't bother having it fixed I should 
just buy a new one.

I haven't called Northern Trust yet. I will call them this afternoon. With 
regard to the benefits I don't think I have received the 2001 benefits 
package yet but I will check. If I don't want to change my coverage do I have 
to fill anything out?

Just thought I would drop you guys a note and let you know that I am coming 
to Houston on Thursday night. I will be in the office Friday morning but I am 
planning to do a bunch of running around after the cash market slows down. 
See you in a couple of days.

Andrew,

Nice to hear from you. Hope all is well in the UK. The millenium came and 
went and I think I had a good time. 

I understand MH has formally resigned his position at ML. Good for him. That 
is a shit business with no future. The broker is the buggy whip of the 
financial 

services industry. 

I have another friend moving to London soon so I have another reason to 
visit. I have to run but I'll keep in touch.

Take care,

Chris

I don't care what we do. I am going to go for a couple of drinks after work 
but nothing out of hand.

Mike called me and said he wanted to hook up with Johnny tonight. I don't 
really want to go back to Red Deer to go out.  

Give me a call at work.

When I think of sunnies I think of those little glasses you wear in tanning 
beds. Your sunglasses are fine. I wore them while I was hangin' around the 
house last night. My neighbors think I am a total freak. Maybe it wasn't the 
sunglasses but the "Sweatin' to the Oldies" I was blaring on my stereo all 
night . I think Richard Simmons is a totally misunderstood genius. I am so 
bored. I'm going to the rodeo this afternoon so that should be good. Better 
get back to doing NOTHING!

I went to Kelly Blue Book on the internet and they provide 2 values for used 
vehicles, a trade in value (what you might expect to get for a vehicle from a 
dealer on trade in) and a retail value (what you might expect to pay for a 
vehicle from a dealer). The following were the values it came up with for a 
Jeep exactly like mine in Montana (closest state).

Trade In - $15330 USD ($22750 CND)
Retail - $20945 USD ($31061 CND)

The retail number seems way too high. I think something like $23 000 to 
$25000 would be fair.

Let me know what you think.

Chris

Kathy,

Could you find out what the breakdown between the $CND and $US monthly index 
positions transfer to our book were for the month of March. 

I just want to double check that it is being represented properly in our 
currency positions.

Thanx,

Chris

Lavorato never let his people put their titles on business cards until they 
became managers. It doesn't really matter. I never really understood why he 
cared. I think they look more professional with titles. You should ask Jan.

Margaret,

I have completed all of the information and am awaiting my University 
transcripts. The copy in my HR file is missing and I have ordered some but 
this may take 2-3 days. Should I send the other info. and forward the 
transcripts when I receive them or wait and send it all together?

Let me know,

Chris

Dear Ann Landers:

I am a sailor in the merchant navy. My parents live in Mississauga and one
of my sisters, who lives in Toronto, is married to a natural gas trader from
Calgary. My Father and Mother have recently been arrested for growing and
selling marijuana and are currently dependent on my two sisters, who are
prostitutes. I have two brothers, one who is currently serving a life
sentence in a Winnipeg prison for the rape & murder of a teenage boy in
1994, the other is currently being held in the Kingston jail on remand for
charges of incest with  his three children.

I have recently become engaged to marry a former Thai prostitute who indeed
is still a part time "working girl" in a brothel, however, her time there is
limited as she has recently been infected with an STD. We intend to marry as
soon as possible and are currently looking into the possibility of opening
our own brothel with my fianc, utilising her knowledge of the industry
working as the manager. I am hoping my two sisters would be interested in
joining our team. Although I would prefer them not to prostitute themselves,
it would at least get them off the streets and hopefully the heroin.

My problem is this: I love my fianc, and look forward to bringing her into
the family and of course I want to be totally honest with her.

Should I tell her about my brother-in-law being a gas trader?

Could you cancel my PAC plan after the September contribution.

I have thought more about the leverage idea you suggested and want to talk to 
you. Can I give you a call later this afternoon? What time are you going to 
be in the office until? What is you home phone number. I will be at the 
office late tonight working on move shit.

Just thought I would let you know that we have a prowler in our midst. I had 
about $30 worth of change (loonies and twoonies) taken from my desk drawer 
between Friday and this morning.

Could have been the smed guys, the cleaning staff or the Easter bunny for all 
I know. 

Just thought I would mention it because Milly said he had the same thing 
happen to him last week.

Mike,

What's going on? I'm coming home Nov.22 for a few days. Ryan and I are going 
to go snowboarding on Friday the 24th. You should come. I am really happy 
with my car. It is a silver/black IS 300. I was suffering a little post 
purchase anxiety but I'm over it. Fuck it! You live once. Things here are 
pretty good. It helps having a couple of good friends who have been here a 
while. How are things in Calgary? I hope you have pictures from Halloween. 
Send me you address and phone #'s. I lost my old address book. I am loving 
this palm pilot. You have to get one of these things. I am going to buy a 
playstation sometime this week. Should I buy Tony Hawk 1 or 2? Better hop. 
I'll call you one night this week.

Chris

BinBin,
I am having trouble running new calc's in the test environment.  I want to 
run the implicit position report for our entire book and see how it compares 
to our excel models (post id 834931/836743/839620... anyone will to).  The 
reports I print in Stage are always blank.  I can run calc's using the 
implcit command but I can not print reports on the new postid.

The top page request in an old request but the expicit report request is a 
new one.  I need to be able to look at the positions this way as well as the 
implicit way.

Subject: Re: IM Position reports  

Kathy,

The port_calc  version you have now when run from the port_calc screen in the 
egsstage environment doesn't include the changes for the "Implicit reports" 
related functionalities. This is because the current setup is for a testing 
version which is being used by the Houston currently.

To solve this problem, we have just put a run script : 
/home/kreeve/port_calc/run_implcit in your directory: /home/kreeve/port_cal.

For the testing, cd to /home/kreeve/port_cal,  then run the script:  
run_implcit  postid (you need to set up a postid for the test run).

To get the reports, you can still use the port_calc screen brought up in the 
egsstage environment (you can bring it up by typing: runmt on the command 
line)

postid 747584 is still available in the production environment, to run the 
test version of port_calc in egsstage, you need to have a data set in the 
egsstage database.


By the way, Are the issues you attatched in the reports(explici report and 
top page report) new requests ?

Please see the attached issues regarding the reports.


Also, under esggsate I can not seem to bring up only old calc's (including 
747584), in order to copy/amend them.  I need to test other types of deals so 
I need to be able to bring things up postid's in portcalc.  Any ideas what 
might be wrong?  Note that I can print reports from the reportscreen.

John,

Where are we at on credit with these guys. 

They won't sell me gas because they say we need to increase Enron Canada's 
parental guarentee.

This is costing me deals and I need to know what is going on soon.

Thanx,

Chris

I am leaving in a 2-3 weeks. Pretty much as soon as I can get all my shit 
together. Nice timing on my part. No winter for Chris. I'll think of you in 
the snow when I'm on the golf course.

I told Paul that you called him yesterday so abruptly because you didn't want 
to waste his time while you got tests done for arthritis. I told him I told 
you to call him back and at least hear what he has to say. He said they are 
looking for people and based on what I told him an interview was a formality.

How's it going? Hear you are working pretty crazy hours. Went to NN with the 
boys on Saturday and played golf in Kananaskis yesterday so all in all a good 
weekend. I have a post stampede cold so I won't be doing much other than work 
and sleep for a few days. Take it easy and write back when you get a minute.

Saturday was really fun. Golf was great. Mike and Andrew's group was by far 
the drunkest foursome. Dinner was good and then we went to the Sutter club to 
play pool. That is when things got out of hand. We got Ryan a bright yellow 
T-shirt with "NOBODY KNOWS I'M A LESBIAN" written in big block letters. Call 
me tonight and I'll give you all the gory details. My head still hurts.

It's great that your coming to Calgary to study for a couple of months. 
You'll have to work extra hard in June so you can kick back during Stampede. 
Things here are pretty much unchanged. Working quite a bit and doing a little 
snowboarding and beer drinking on the weekends. Things could definately be 
worse. Going golfing in Playa del Carmen in a couple of weeks. That should be 
fun. Looking forward to chilling out by the pool for a week and doing 
nothing. This year has been a roller coaster ride for my trading profits and 
I need a break. Met a really cool girl recently. Will advise if anything 
interesting devolops there. It's a beautiful Sunday afternoon and I have no 
idea why I am at work. I think I'm going to go to the driving range. Take it 
easy and w/b!

Subject: I Am Canadian



   My name is Bob, and I am Canadian.

   I am a minority in Vancouver, Banff, and every casino in this country.

   I was born in 1972, yet I am responsible for some Native's great great
   grandfather who screwed himself out of his land in the 1800's.

   I pay import tax on cars made in Ontario.

   I am allowed to skydive and smoke, but not allowed to drive without a
   seat belt.

   All the money I make up until mid July must go to paying taxes.

   I live and work among people who believe Americans are ignorant.

   These same people cannot name this country's new Territory.

   Although I am sometimes forced to live on Kraft Dinner and don't have a
   pot to piss in, I sleep well knowing that I've helped purchase a nice
six
   figure home in Vancouver for some unskilled Chinese refugee.

   Although they are unpatriotic and constantly try to separate, Quebec
   still  provides my nation's Prime Ministers.

   95% of my nation's international conflicts are over fish.

   I'm supposed to call black people African Canadians, although I'm sure
   none of them have ever been to Africa, or east of Halifax for that
matter.

   I believe that paying a 200% tax on alcohol is fair.

   I believe that same tax on gasoline is also fair.

   Even if I have no idea what happened to that old rifle my grandfather
   gave me when I was 14, I will be considered a criminal if I don't
register
   it.

   I DO know Jeff from Toronto.

   I often badmouth the United States, and then vacation there three times
   a year.

   I'm led to believe that some lazy ass unionized broom pusher who makes
   $30 an hour is underpaid and therefore must go on strike, but paying $10
an
   hour to someone who works 12 hour shifts at forty below on an oil rig is
fair.

   I believe that paying $30 million for 3 stripes (The Voice of Fire) by
   the National Art Gallery was a good purchase, even though 99% of this
   country didn't want it, or will ever see it.

   When I look at my pay stub and realize that I take home a third of what
   I actually make, I say "Oh well, at least we have better health care
than
   the Americans"

   It must bail out farmers when their crops are too wet or too dry,
   because I control the rain.

   My National Anthem has versions in both official  languages, and I don't
   know either of them.

   Canada is the highest taxed nation in North America, the biggest
   military buffer for the United States, and the number one destination
  for fleeing boat people.

   I am not an angry white male.  I am an angry broke taxpayer.

   My name is Bob, and I am Canadian

Brad,

I'm on dope. I was looking at the wrong bank statement. The $700 number 
sounds correct. Can you sell that stuff for me please. I'll give you a cheque 
this weekend to top up my RRSP.

Thanx,

Chris
