Hi Christie,

when do you sleep? 2 am, ugh!

ok,  you were correct, my invitation was to those people within Enron that 
the students talked with before interviewing competitors, and it was an 
invitation to the presentation only.  I didn't think any of them would be 
invited to the dinner, and probably none will even come to the presentation.  
The invitation did elicit one request for the final report though, so maybe 
it wasn't a complete waste.  

I didn't realize that the dinner had turned into a box visit.  that sounds 
great.  I wish the group could have made it to dinner before the first game, 
that would have made the whole slumming experience better.  Now they'll get 
the royal treatment at Enron Field.  It'll be great.

Vince invited 4 people from Rice:

Dennis W. Loughridge, Director of Energy Consortium; lounghrid@rice.edu
Carrie Miller, Director of MBA Program; cmiller@rice.edu
Deborah Barrett, Inst. Communications, barrett@rice.edu
Dr. Wil Uecker, Associate Dean for Executive Education,uecker@rice.edu

Loughridge wrote back saying he'll come, I don't know about the others

Here are the 6 students emails:

"Ritwik \(Ronnie\) Ghosh" <ghoshr@rice.edu>, "Ivy Ghose" <ghosei@rice.edu>, 
"Luigi Calabrese" <luigical@rice.edu>, "Pravas Sud" <pravas@rice.edu>, "Syed 
\(Farhan\) Iqbal" <iqbal@rice.edu> 
<cwomack@rice.edu>

your 2 from Rice makes a total of 12 from Rice, I guess

let me know if you would like me to do anything else related to Monday
look forward to seeing you then

ken

As faculty advisor to the Finance Club, Prof. Barb Ostdeik is encouraging
all members to take advantage of a great opportunity to learn more about
trading operations from two very respected individuals in the industry.
Keith Anderson of BlackRock, Inc (JGSM 1983) and Dexter Senft of Lehman
Brothers & TradeWeb LLC (Rice 1974) have visited the Jones School to give
this lecture and students have raved about them. Albert Wang's Fixed Income
and Advanced Investments classes are required to attend, and James Weston
recommends for his Applied Finance students and any first years taking
Investments next year to be there.

When:
9:45 a.m. d 11:15 a.m.
Wednesday
April 18

Where:
Room 117
Herring Hall

Presentation/Discussion Topics:
Trading Tactics d phone trades vs. electronic trading
Evolution of e-trading in fixed income markets
The future of the trading desk
Buy-side vs. Sell-side issues

Speaker Profiles:

Keith Anderson, Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer, Fixed Incom=
e
of BlackRock, Inc., is co-head of the Fixed Income Operating Committee,
Chairman of the Investment Strategy Group and a member of BlackRock=01,s
Management Committee.   Mr. Anderson is responsible for global fixed income
strategy, asset allocation and the overall management of client portfolios.
He coordinates a team of thirty-two portfolio managers and more than
twenty-five credit and quantitative analysts.

Mr. Anderson is a member of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, whic=
h
meets quarterly in Washington, D.C. with the Secretary and Staff of the U.S=
.
Treasury to advise them on the financing and management of the Federal debt=
.

Prior to founding BlackRock in 1988, Mr. Anderson was a Vice President in
Fixed Income Research at The First Boston Corporation, working in mortgage
securities and derivative products strategies.  Mr. Anderson with Criterion
Investment Management Company where he had primary responsibility for a $2.=
8
billion fixed income portfolio.

Mr. Anderson has authored numerous articles on fixed income strategies,
including two articles in The Handbook of Fixed Income Options: "Scenario
Analysis and the Use of Options in Total Return Portfolio Management" and
"Measuring, Interpreting, and Applying Volatility within the Fixed Income
Market".




Dexter Senft is a Managing Director with global responsibility for Fixed
Income electronic commerce for Lehman Brothers. During his eight years at
the firm, he has also managed or co-managed Lehman=01,s Fixed Income Resear=
ch,
Quantitative Research, Counterparty Credit and Global Economics departments=
.

Mr. Senft is the former Chairman of TradeWeb LLC, a consortium-owned
electronic bond trading system whose volume currently averages over $10
billion per day, and of which Lehman Brothers is a founding shareholder. He
remains on TradeWeb=01,s Board, and chairs TradeWeb=01,s trading protocol
committee, which oversees the rules that govern the electronic flow of
information within the system.

Mr. Senft also serves on the Bond Market Association=01,s Committee for
Alternative Trading Systems, as well as its Online Bond Steering Committee
and he chairs the subcommittee on e-commerce protocols and standards.

Prior to EJV, Mr. Senft spent 17 years at The First Boston Corporation (now
part of CS First Boston), where he was a Managing Director and head of Fixe=

articles on mortgage securities, fixed income derivatives, and quantitative
portfolio management, and his work continues to be among the readings for
CFA applicants. In 1983, Mr. Senft led the product team that created the
first CMO for Freddie Mac.


This is regarding the e-trading/bond market session
arranged for April 18.  As part of the 1st year finance elective, you may
have already been informed by James Weston (Were you?) but I need to get
the info out to more 2nd years as well.

Do you usually send out your speaker announcements to all faculty,
students, and staff?

Albert Wang's Fixed Income and Advanced Investments classes are required to
come and James Weston will be encouraging 1st years that took the finance
elective to come.

These guys are pretty good - they came a few years back.

Thanks.

Please respond to Dear Vince,

I was wondering if you were able to open the attachment with my resume this
time. Rumor has it that you are currently hiring people for your group. Is
this true?

Sincerely,
Helen

Ronnie,


regarding the parking situation downtown 
The closest parking garage with visitor parking is the one at Allens Center.  


your agenda, to define
- what the scope of the project is
- what do you expect of the project -- in other words what are you trying to
find out from the study, this will help define the scope
-discuss a timeline
-tools that we can use at Enron
-are there any projects at Enron (past or present) that we can draw on or
build on

sounds good.  Do you all have the original scope Vince wrote up?  Although it 
is broad, its a good beginning for your scope.  Once you flesh-out the scope, 
we'll see if any existing reports can be found that may be helpful.


regarding industry research 

check out red herring and other online resources.  

see you later

Mr. Kaminski,

You will need to speak with David Kilgore at kilgore@rice.edu or by calling
David at 713-348-5378 regarding getting set up in EMBANET and if you can
have access the database from the outside.

Hi Christie,

when do you sleep? 2 am, ugh!

ok,  you were correct, my invitation was to those people within Enron that the students talked with before interviewing competitors, and it was an invitation to the presentation only.  I didn't think any of them would be invited to the dinner, and probably none will even come to the presentation.  The invitation did elicit one request for the final report though, so maybe it wasn't a complete waste.  

I didn't realize that the dinner had turned into a box visit.  that sounds great.  I wish the group could have made it to dinner before the first game, that would have made the whole slumming experience better.  Now they'll get the royal treatment at Enron Field.  It'll be great.

Vince invited 4 people from Rice:

Dennis W. Loughridge, Director of Energy Consortium; lounghrid@rice.edu
Carrie Miller, Director of MBA Program; cmiller@rice.edu
Deborah Barrett, Inst. Communications, barrett@rice.edu
Dr. Wil Uecker, Associate Dean for Executive Education,uecker@rice.edu

Loughridge wrote back saying he'll come, I don't know about the others

Here are the 6 students emails:

"Ritwik \(Ronnie\) Ghosh" <ghoshr@rice.edu>, "Ivy Ghose" <ghosei@rice.edu>, "Luigi Calabrese" <luigical@rice.edu>, "Pravas Sud" <pravas@rice.edu>, "Syed \(Farhan\) Iqbal" <iqbal@rice.edu> 
<cwomack@rice.edu>

your 2 from Rice makes a total of 12 from Rice, I guess

let me know if you would like me to do anything else related to Monday
look forward to seeing you then

ken

Mr. Fastow,

I'm writing all of our participants and confirming plans for the upcoming
corporate finance meetings on May 4-5 here.  As a reminder, you are slated
to sit on the executive option/equity dilution panel on Saturday
morning.  Dave Yermack from NYU, the number one expert on this issue, is
presenting at that session.  (Again, serving as a panelist should require
little preparation on your behalf.)

Also, you and your wife are welcome to attend the dinner on Friday evening,
May 4.  It will be held in the Baker Institute across from the business
school.  Tom Copeland is our speaker - (I think he plans to focus his
remarks on real options).  Vince Kaminski  has told me he will be at the
dinner, however his wife is out of town and will not be.

Please call me direct if I can be of any help or assistance.   I look
forward to seeing you soon.  I've attached a copy of the program along with
a name rooster of those planning to attend.


Dave Ikenberry

Hi, Vince:

We are considering a preliminary list of speakers for Rice/Enron Seminar Series in Finance for Fall 2001 and Spring 2002.  Do you have any persons in mind that you and your group want to include in the list?  Finance faculty will meet to finalize the list later.

Thanks,

Albert

P.S.: Is Ronnie Chahal still around?  She is currently in my Enron distribution list with email address: rchahal@ess.enron.com.  I have received an error message indicating a failure of delivering email to her address.

Thank you, Vince.  We look forward to another successful seminar series.

I will check into getting a mug design and get cost figures for you.  We'll
get something done this summer so that we are ready to go for the fall.

Hi guys,

Vince talked with Christie and they both are available next Tuesday (game day) at 9 am.  Can you meet then to start preparing an outline?

Also would you be up for a presentation at the research group's lunch meeting next Thursday?  Vince will be out, but you'll undoubtably get some interesting questions from others at the meeting, if your up for it.  Let me know soon, and we can schedule you for next Thursday.

talk to you later

Please respond to Hello Vince and Kenneth,

My teammates and I would like to schedule a time with you to discuss our
presentation materials.  We would prefer to meet with you sometime on
Thursday so that we can have the weekend to include any changes that you may
suggest, but we will accommodate your schedules.

Thank you for all of your help,

Perfect.  Thanks, Vince.

In all likelihood, it would be just fine, it is just not customary for job
talks to include others.  Again, since you are a member of the Risk
Management Chair Search Committee (you may not know of this official
capacity, but I believe it is the case), we by all means hope that you will
be able to attend the seminar as well as dinner.

I will get details on the schedules to you early next week.

Vince,

Many thanks for the invitation.? I'm leaving for a conference in New Orleans 
today and won't be in town.? However, I'd love to join you if dinner should 
happen again in the future.

Thanks again for all your support and interest in the ALP program.? I feel 
confident that this will be a great project.

Vince:

I have attached the general design we are proposing for the Enron Seminar
Series mug.  We have a little refinement to do - spacing here and there a
couple type-o's but this is the idea.  If you like it, we will put an order 
in.

I'll put out an announcement on the seminar schedule shortly.  So far the
fall line up includes Will Goetzman - Yale, Lenard Mirman - Virgina, Jeff
Pontiff - U. of Washington, George Allyannis - Darden, and Charles Lee -
Cornell.

Thank you.

Hi Judith!

I  have a special parking ticket for Malcolm and Gil to use in Dr. Gillis's car.  Then, I'll have a car pick up Gil when he's ready to leave the game--we'll take care of everything (thanks for offering)--we're really looking forward to the event!

Best regards for a great weekend!

Christie:

Could you please fill me in on the logistics?  Dr. Gillis and Gil Whitaker
will
be at the APL project presentation at Enron at 4 p.m..  Further, they both
plan
to attend the dinner at Enron Field.  However, Dr. Gillis must skip the
game due
to an early morning breakfast the next day.  Will you provide special parking
at the dinner/game?  I think Dr. G and Gil will go together, then I will have
Dr. Gillis picked up by limo, at approximately 8:00 p.m.  Does this sound
feasible?

Christie,

This is one of the communications regarding Rice CFOs conference.

Andy requires some gentle persuasion.

Hi Vince,

I may have missed something, however don't believe I have received any
communication recently from Andy Festow about this upcoming May 4-5 corp.
fin. conference.  I hope he is still planning to come, yet I don't know as
of now.

I have Andy penciled in as a participant on a "panel" that is discussing
equity dilution from stock option compensation (the role of panelist should
require little, if any, preparation time).   Of course, I want Andy to
come, however he is concerned about his ability to attend, I probably
should identify another person or two to serve on the panel.

Dave.

I left you a message regarding The National Forum on Corporate Finance

They would be delighted if you could serve as a panel  member
at this conference.

Here are the coordinates of the professor at Rice who

Thanks.

One other person that I forgot to mention -- Praveen Kumar.  I don't know
exactly what he does, mostly theory stuff I guess.  Any way, he is also
really good and highly respected in the profession; probably ranks right up
there with (but second to) Bong-Soo.

Christie,

Shirley reserved room 49C1 for Monday 4:00 p.m.  presentation.

Can you  issue the formal invitation to our guests with the game/dinner
details? I don't have all the details regarding the Enron Field
box and time. I am out most of the day on Wednesday but we can
discuss the details on Thursday. 

Hope to see you on Saturday at  the concert.

Hi Vince,

After we hung up the phone yesterday, I sent you an email as we
agreed.  However today I looked in my "outbox" and see that nothing was
sent to you.  Thus, I'm trying again.  If this is redundant, sorry.

Attached is a copy of the Corporate Finance Forum I am trying to
organize.  Any comments or suggestions you might have would be
appreciated.  I look forward to Enron getting involved in this project if
at all possible.

Secondly, I am confirming the dates for the two visitors for the Risk
Management chair.

Philippe Jorion,  Seminar on 2/15 and dinner on 2/14
Andrew Karolyi, Seminar on 2/23 and dinner on 2/23.

Lets try to go flying sometime soon

Thanks for your help and support,

Dave

Vince, I finally joined a team that only had two members.  It looks like our
paper will only be about 13 to 15 pages.  We were wondering that since our

possible relax the length requirement?

Thanks,

E-mail is perfect.  It allows me to just dump your grades directly into our
database.  I do then sign a hard copy (indicating that I am signing in
proxy for you) to hand over to the registrar.  If you prefer, you could fax
the information as well (713-348-5251).   Thank you for your help! - Pam

Vince:

Our PR staff has put together a great design for the Finance Seminar
mugs.  We need to get a clean copy of the Enron logo, if possible.  The
design is in Adobe Pagemaker if your people can find a logo that can be
pulled into that format.  They can send it directly to me and I will make
sure it gets to the right place.

Thanks so much.

Hello Mr. Fastow,

Sheridan Titman from UT-Austin and I are both delighted you will be able to
participate in the conference we are organizing here at Rice.  Attached is
a revised overview of the organization - the second page contains an
up-to-date list of the firms involved.

Also, I'm attaching a draft of the actual program.  After each
presentation, I have a panel of three or four people who will can respond
to some of the points or issues raised in each discussion.  These remarks
will be very informal and ad hoc and thus should require no preparation on
your part.  Reaction to this format has been good and I think it will be a
great way to stimulate discussion/debate.

I have you penciled in to serve on one such panel on Saturday morning, May
5.  The topic deals with handing the dilution arising from executive stock
options and involves the top academic expert on executive stock options,
David Yermack from NYU.

Let me know if you have any concerns about this or if a conflict
arises.  Also, I will be e-mailing some registration materials to you in
the next week.

I look forward to seeing you soon.

Dave Ikenberry.

Hi Andy

I don't recall sending the above attachment.  If so, please pardon my
redundancy.

Attached is some registration details for the upcoming corporate finance
conference here at Rice.  When you get a moment, if you could have someone
on your staff return it that would be great.

Each topic is followed by "panel" discussion.  We have you slated to serve
on the panel dealing with"Equity Dilution from Option Compensation" and
will feature work by David Yermack from NYU.  Stu Gillan from TIAA/CREF
will be serving on the panel with you along with John Blahnik from Delphi
Automotive.

Please call me direct if I can be of any help or assistance.

Rice/Enron Finance Seminar Participants:
Luigi Zingales will present a paper co-authored with Raghuram G. Rajan, entitled "The Great Reversals: The Politics of Financial Development in the 20th Century."  The full text of the paper is available in PDF form on the seminar website:http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~jgsfss The baton for organizing the seminar series has been passed from Barbara Ostdiek to myself.  If you have questions regarding the series, please contact me (wangfa@rice.edu or 713-348-5404).
As we have done in the past, we will post the abstract and a downloadable version of the paper (if available) to the website a week or two before the seminar.  The website will also provide a link to the speaker's homepage so you can access his or her biographical information.  If the paper is not available at the website, I will send a hardcopy to interested Jones School faculty, to Felecia Jones (Economics), Sorin Sorescu (University of Houston), and Vince Kaminski (Enron). 
I will e-mail an announcement before each seminar, reminding you of the seminar date, time, and location.  The distribution list will include everyone that receives this e-mail.  Please let me know if you would like to be deleted from the mailing list or if you know of someone who should be added.

Barbara,

I called Vlady Gorny and explained that the presentation by Jorion is not 
offered
under the umbrella of the  seminar sponsored by Enron and that it is a 
closed meeting for the School faculty.

I don't think that Enron would open its job interviews to Rice observers
who expressed interest and I made this comment to Vlady. He is OK with this.

You can let his program director know that I have explained   to Vlady
that it is a meeting for limited audience and that he does not expect to be 
invited.


Please, let me know the details of the dinners.

Vince

The baton for organizing the seminar series has been passed from Barbara 
Ostdiek to myself.? If you have questions regarding the series, please

available at the website, I will send a hardcopy to interested Jones School 
faculty, to Felecia Jones (Economics), Sorin Sorescu (University of Houston), 
and Vince Kaminski (Enron). 

I will e-mail an announcement before each seminar, reminding you of the 
seminar date, time, and location.? The distribution list will include

Jack,

This is up to the MBA program. 
I have no problem if they agreed to it.
The only constraint is the space and we
shall have to address the issue on Thursday
during the first class.

Drilling currently operates three land rigs along the
Texas Gulf Coast and is constucting a fourth.  I have
received permision from the EMBA program to audit the

Vince, I finally joined a team that only had two members.  It looks like our
paper will only be about 13 to 15 pages.  We were wondering that since our
team is less than half the size of some of the other teams, if you could
possible relax the length requirement?

Thanks,
Brian Nelson

Good to hear from you.  Things are going pretty well hear, but busy with the
end of the semester coming up.

As for U of H, I guess there are several possibilities depending on what
Shane wants to do.  The best researcher in their group by far, in my
opinion, is Bong-Soo Lee.  But he does more general asset pricing stuff.
Minnesota econ phD, really smart.  Their main derivatives guy is Rabon
Rabinovich.  He's done some good work in the past but not very active in the
last five or ten years.  Or, you could go with Ron Singer or Art Warga
(Art's more respected and more active).  These guys are more senior, more
general, and do more research than Ramon -- I would guess that they tend to
be the workhorses in terms of advising PhD students at u of h.

In any case, please destroy this info as soon as you digest it.  I would
hate for my candidate assessments to ever get passed along to the good folks
at u of h.

Students, Faculty, and Staff,

Don't forget to participate in the Coffee Colloquium this morning (4-25-01)
from 9:45 to 10:45 held outside room 124.  This will be the last Coffee
Colloquium of this academic year.  Hope to see you there.

The Coffee Colloquium is an informal gathering which will allow faculty,
administration, and students an opportunity to talk, exchange ideas and get
to know each other better.  The Jones School Coffee Colloquium will be a
regular gathering every Wednesday (same time, same place) unless there is
another scheduled event (Dean's Lecture, exam day, holiday).  We usually
have coffee, tea, juice, soft drinks, and some light snacks available to
all who participate.

I have attached the general design we are proposing for the Enron Seminar
Series mug.  We have a little refinement to do - spacing here and there a
couple type-o's but this is the idea.  If you like it, we will put an order 
in.

I'll put out an announcement on the seminar schedule shortly.  So far the
fall line up includes Will Goetzman - Yale, Lenard Mirman - Virgina, Jeff
Pontiff - U. of Washington, George Allyannis - Darden, and Charles Lee -
Cornell.

Thank you.

As faculty advisor to the Finance Club, Prof. Barb Ostdeik is encouraging
all members to take advantage of a great opportunity to learn more about
trading operations from two very respected individuals in the industry.
Keith Anderson of BlackRock, Inc (JGSM 1983) and Dexter Senft of Lehman
Brothers & TradeWeb LLC (Rice 1974) have visited the Jones School to give
this lecture and students have raved about them. Albert Wang's Fixed Income
and Advanced Investments classes are required to attend, and James Weston
recommends for his Applied Finance students and any first years taking
Investments next year to be there.

When:
9:45 a.m. - 11:15 a.m.
Wednesday
April 18

Where:
Room 117
Herring Hall

Presentation/Discussion Topics:
Trading Tactics - phone trades vs. electronic trading
Evolution of e-trading in fixed income markets
The future of the trading desk
Buy-side vs. Sell-side issues

Speaker Profiles:

Keith Anderson, Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer, Fixed Income
of BlackRock, Inc., is co-head of the Fixed Income Operating Committee,
Chairman of the Investment Strategy Group and a member of BlackRock's
Management Committee.   Mr. Anderson is responsible for global fixed income
strategy, asset allocation and the overall management of client portfolios.
He coordinates a team of thirty-two portfolio managers and more than
twenty-five credit and quantitative analysts.

Mr. Anderson is a member of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, which
meets quarterly in Washington, D.C. with the Secretary and Staff of the U.S.
Treasury to advise them on the financing and management of the Federal debt.

Prior to founding BlackRock in 1988, Mr. Anderson was a Vice President in
Fixed Income Research at The First Boston Corporation, working in mortgage
securities and derivative products strategies.  Mr. Anderson with Criterion
Investment Management Company where he had primary responsibility for a $2.8
billion fixed income portfolio.

Mr. Anderson has authored numerous articles on fixed income strategies,
including two articles in The Handbook of Fixed Income Options: "Scenario
Analysis and the Use of Options in Total Return Portfolio Management" and
"Measuring, Interpreting, and Applying Volatility within the Fixed Income
Market".




Dexter Senft is a Managing Director with global responsibility for Fixed
Income electronic commerce for Lehman Brothers. During his eight years at
the firm, he has also managed or co-managed Lehman's Fixed Income Research,
Quantitative Research, Counterparty Credit and Global Economics departments.

Mr. Senft is the former Chairman of TradeWeb LLC, a consortium-owned
electronic bond trading system whose volume currently averages over $10
billion per day, and of which Lehman Brothers is a founding shareholder. He
remains on TradeWeb's Board, and chairs TradeWeb's trading protocol
committee, which oversees the rules that govern the electronic flow of
information within the system.

Mr. Senft also serves on the Bond Market Association's Committee for
Alternative Trading Systems, as well as its Online Bond Steering Committee
and he chairs the subcommittee on e-commerce protocols and standards.

Prior to EJV, Mr. Senft spent 17 years at The First Boston Corporation (now
part of CS First Boston), where he was a Managing Director and head of Fixed
Income Research and Product Development. He is a widely published author of
articles on mortgage securities, fixed income derivatives, and quantitative
portfolio management, and his work continues to be among the readings for
CFA applicants. In 1983, Mr. Senft led the product team that created the
first CMO for Freddie Mac.


This is regarding the e-trading/bond market session
arranged for April 18.  As part of the 1st year finance elective, you may
have already been informed by James Weston (Were you?) but I need to get
the info out to more 2nd years as well.

Do you usually send out your speaker announcements to all faculty,
students, and staff?

Albert Wang's Fixed Income and Advanced Investments classes are required to
come and James Weston will be encouraging 1st years that took the finance
elective to come.

These guys are pretty good - they came a few years back.

Thanks.

HI Vince,
As always, I enjoyed having dinner with you.  Its always interesting.

Per your recommendation from last night, you should have received a note I
just sent to Andy Fastow.

If you can fit it into you schedule, Sheridan and I would appreciate having
you attend the conference, the conference dinner and reception.  Also, if
you would like to participate on Saturday only, that is a possibility as
well.  Whatever might work with you.

Regards,

Dave

Thank you for meeting with the students from Rice University's Jesse H. Jones 
Graduate School of Management in April.  The students greatly appreciated the 
opportunity to talk with you.  Your perspective and insights into EOL and its 
competitors helped the students gain much more useful information in their 
interviews with eNymex, HoustonStreet.com, ICE, DynegyDirect, and other 
energy e-commerce platforms.

The students will present the results of their research next Monday (May 7) 
at 4:00 p.m. in room 49C1.  We would be delighted if you can attend their 
presentation.  If you cannot attend but would like a copy of their final 
report, please feel free to let me know and I will make sure you get it.

Thanks again for your help.

Graders usually follow the following guidelines:

- Half of the class gets A- and above;
- The other half of the class gets B+ and below
-  Instructors seldom ever give grades below B-, but it happens in rare cases
- The highest grade possible is A+

Christie,

This is one of the communications regarding Rice CFOs conference.

Andy requires some gentle persuasion.

Hi Vince,

I may have missed something, however don't believe I have received any
communication recently from Andy Festow about this upcoming May 4-5 corp.
fin. conference.  I hope he is still planning to come, yet I don't know as
of now.

I have Andy penciled in as a participant on a "panel" that is discussing
equity dilution from stock option compensation (the role of panelist should
require little, if any, preparation time).   Of course, I want Andy to
come, however he is concerned about his ability to attend, I probably
should identify another person or two to serve on the panel.

Dave.

Hi Vince

That's great - delighted you'll be participating. I've put you down as the
chairman for stream 1, day 1 on 9 May 2000.

By the way, is your job title still VP, Head of Research at Enron North
America? I need to know for the brochure.

If I don't speak to you before the new year, I wish you a very Merry Xmas
and a Happy New Millennium!

Emma

Andy,

I am sending you a draft oof a proposal regarding national forum for top 
finance practitioners and
academics. The idea came from a professor at Rice University who
has already received a commitment from a number
of most distinguished CFOs. 

Please, read the outline and see if you would be interested in joining this 
forum.
I shall be glad to help to arrange  a meeting with Prof. Ikenberry.

Good morning:

The Research Group will have 5 Rice students, who are working on an 
Enron project for their Doctorate, coming to Enron for approximately
1 week.  They will be sitting in a conference room located on the 19th
floor Research area.

We need to get them internet access (to be applied to one computer), with
one logon id and password.

Will you please let me know what I need to do to get this accomplished?

They will be coming this Thursday, April 5th.

Thanks!

Thank you for meeting with the students from Rice University's Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Management in April.  The students greatly appreciated the opportunity to talk with you.  Your perspective and insights into EOL and its competitors helped the students gain much more useful information in their interviews with eNymex, HoustonStreet.com, ICE, DynegyDirect, and other energy e-commerce platforms.

The students will present the results of their research next Monday (May 7) at 4:00 p.m. in room 49C1.  We would be delighted if you can attend their presentation.  If you cannot attend but would like a copy of their final report, please feel free to let me know and I will make sure you get it.

Thanks again for your help.

Hi guys,

Vince talked with Christie and they both are available next Tuesday (game 
day) at 9 am.  Can you meet then to start preparing an outline?

Also would you be up for a presentation at the research group's lunch meeting 
next Thursday?  Vince will be out, but you'll undoubtably get some 
interesting questions from others at the meeting, if your up for it.  Let me 
know soon, and we can schedule you for next Thursday.

talk to you later

We tried to use both the Enron logo and the Rice University seal.  It just
didn't work.  There seemed to be a few problems.  The first was color - as
is, the mug will be black with metallic gold text; introducing the other
colors was distracting.  Our admissions department uses a black and gold
mug that is quite stunning and, it seems to go with "finance."  That was my
motivation.  The second problem was that the logos themselves, even if it
made sense to do them in gold, made the design too busy - a lot of the
appeal in these "word" mugs is the clean, linear look.  Finally, I think
lack of company and competing business school logos increases the chances
that the academics who come to present their work at our workshop will
display this mug on their desk or on their shelves.

I think the mug will look quite stunning and I think the display of finance
terms will make it an interesting conversion piece - I've never seen
anything like it in academics, let alone in finance.  I think Enron's
sponsorship of the Seminar Series will get noticed when people follow their
interest in the mugs to say "What is this?  Where'd this come from?"

I'm hoping this version will be acceptable to you for our first shot at
this.   Please advise.

Hi Judith!

I  have a special parking ticket for Malcolm and Gil to use in Dr. Gillis's 
car.  Then, I'll have a car pick up Gil when he's ready to leave the 
game--we'll take care of everything (thanks for offering)--we're really 
looking forward to the event!

Best regards for a great weekend!

Christie:

Could you please fill me in on the logistics?  Dr. Gillis and Gil Whitaker
will
be at the APL project presentation at Enron at 4 p.m..  Further, they both
plan
to attend the dinner at Enron Field.  However, Dr. Gillis must skip the
game due
to an early morning breakfast the next day.  Will you provide special parking
at the dinner/game?  I think Dr. G and Gil will go together, then I will have
Dr. Gillis picked up by limo, at approximately 8:00 p.m.  Does this sound
feasible?

Hi Vince,
We have tentatively re-scheduled Philippe Jorion for Monday, March 19.  He
will likely come for dinner on Sunday, March 18 and return to California on
March 19.  Would dinner on the 18th and/or a seminar sometime on Monday the
19th work with your schedule?

Thanks, Dave

Dear Vince,

I was wondering if you were able to open the attachment with my resume this
time. Rumor has it that you are currently hiring people for your group. Is
this true?

Sincerely,
Helen

Andy,

I am sending you a draft oof a proposal regarding national forum for top 
finance practitioners and
academics. The idea came from a professor at Rice University who
has already received a commitment from a number
of most distinguished CFOs. 

Please, read the outline and see if you would be interested in joining this 
forum.
I shall be glad to help to arrange  a meeting with Prof. Ikenberry.

Vince

I am sending you a draft of the outline  of the course on energy derivatives.
I would  appreciate your comments before I finalize it.

By the way, did we agree on the time schedule for the class?
Tuesday or Thursday evening would work for me.

Hi, Vince:

We are considering a preliminary list of speakers for Rice/Enron Seminar

mind that you and your group want to include in the list?? Finance faculty 
will meet to finalize the list later.

Thanks,

Albert

P.S.: Is Ronnie Chahal still around?? She is currently in my Enron

Here is your latest roster. We are up-to-date on all changes but, of
course, the students may still drop/add up to the second week of module 5.
When the time comes, please check your roster carefully and make sure that
the people on the list really are attending your course. Mistakes happen so
I just would like to make sure we have a correct record.

As always, let me know if you would like the excel folder with e-mail
addresses. I don't send them at the same time to avoid overwhelming our
e-mail system. Thanks for your help!

Subject: Liz Demers research seminar


Dear faculty

Bob Westbrook and the accounting group has asked me to put together a
continuing series of research workshops in accounting. My intention is to
invite four or five researchers from around the country to present
workshops on topics of interest each year. These are in addition to the
normal recruiting seminars that we will have. The researchers will be a
combination of senior and junior researchers. In addition to adding to our
own research culture, the seminars should help promote the Jones School in
the academic accounting community.

My intention is to invite people that are doing very interesting work that
will be of interest to a large portion of the faculty. Given the small size
of the accounting group, success of the seminars is dependent in part on
the participation of faculty from other disciplines.

Our first seminar will be on February 16  from 10:30-12:00 and will be
conducted by Elizabeth Demers, a Stanford PhD and presently an assistant
professor at Rochester.  Her paper is titled " A Rude Awakening: Internet
Shakeout in 2000" and co-authored with Baruch Lev ( a senior accounting
researcher at NYU).

The work should be of particular interest to faculty in Finance and those
interested in the valuation of internet companies and the value of
intellectual capital and non financial information. I expect that it will
be a very interesting seminar. Liz will arrive Thursday late afternoon and
be here all day on Friday. I invite any of you who would like to meet with
her or join us for a meal, to please let me know.

I will appreciate it if you could plan on attending at least some of our
seminars. I hope that the topics and presenters will be of interest.

Thanks for your support.

I don't know if you noticed that we have Tim Bollerslev on the seminar
schedule for December 8.  In order for Tim to get back to North Carolina on
Friday, we need to move the seminar time.  I thought that the Enron folks
might be interested in his talk so I wanted to get you input on a new
time.  I know that 3:30 is best but would over the noon hour be second best
or would 2:00 be better?

Thanks.

Vince,

19C is available and reserved for 9 am to 10:30, Wednesday.  

Would you like me to try and arrange a tour for the students or should we 
wait until we know more about their interests?  

Are their some other Enron folks you would like to invite for Wednesday?

A copy of Paul Schultz's paper, "Who Makes the Market," is now
available.  The paper to can be obtained (by Monday for sure) from Felicia
Jones (Economics), Latha Ramchand (University of Houston), and Vince
Kaminski (Enron) or Barbara Ostdiek (everyone else).

Paul's seminar is Friday, March 30, at 3:30 in Room 201 (note the room 
change).

The abstract of the paper is copied below:

Abstract

"I provide evidence that Nasdaq dealers make markets in the stocks in which
they receive order flow.  Several variables used to proxy for the stocks
that individual market maker's brokerage customers would trade, including
trading volume, location, underwriting participation and analyst coverage,
are significant determinants of market marking activity.  Informational
advantages may also be a factor in the market making decision as evidenced
by dealers specializing in stocks in specific industries.  Some potential
problems that arise when researchers ignore the integration of market
making with brokerage, securities analysis and underwriting businesses are
discussed."
