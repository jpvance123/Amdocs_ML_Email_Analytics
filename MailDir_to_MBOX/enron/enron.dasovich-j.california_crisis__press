Attached is an article about deregulation, price volatility, California power 
issues and how EES and other energy management type of companies are helping 
with solve these problems. 



Attached is an article about how PG&E is offering incentives to its larger 
customers in California that which asks them to use less energy, in turn the 
customers are guaranteed to be blackout free. There is a little controversy 
over this issue because the incentive is not offered to small business or 
residents.

We have developed an intranet site/database for information tracking purposes 
for the California Power Issue. The intranet site will be placed on the 
home.enron.com webpage by Tuesday morning for all Enron employees to access. 
However, today, this comprehensive database is available to you for your 
California Power Issue needs. 

The database has been populated with the latest information that I have 
received concerning this topic and has been broken down in three categories:
California Power Issues, National Power Issues and Secured Documents. It has 
then been broken down further into subcategories.

The secured documents sections will only be accessible to those that are 
receiving this e-mail. Please let me know if you believe others should have 
access to this information. The secured document section contains all the 
information that I have received that Luntz Consulting has helped us develop, 
i.e. principals, statements, speeches and facts, as well as, talking points 
and other statements developed internally. These documents can be easily 
switched to open access to all Enron employees if you believe that these 
documents should not be restricted.

To access the intranet site you must be logged on to the network and then go 
to this link:  http://nahou-lndev02d.corp.enron.com/GovtAffa.nsf  (It is best 
if you copy this link and paste it in your internet Explorer or Netscape 
browser.)

Once you are at this site you will  be able to access all articles and 
information that I have collected/received concerning the California Power 
Issue. You can navigate the site by using the links on the left hand side of 
the screen. While navigating this site, keep in mind that the actual 
interface will be changed before we go live on Tuesday morning. 

To access the secured documents, click on secured documents and type in your 
user name, which is the same as if you are logging onto the network, and then 
type in your password, which is the same as if you are logging onto the 
network. However, if you have difficulties entering this site, you will need 
to change your Lotus internet password. Which is very simple to do and which 
you will need to do regardless if you decide to use this site or not, it is 
all part of the current computer migration. To change your internet password, 
go to this link  and then hit the edit person key. Go to the last field that 
says internet password and type in whatever password you would like, 
preferably your current network login password. (In the internet password 
section you will see a bunch of numbers and letters, delete those and enter 
your new network password.) 

There are still some bugs that will be worked out by Tuesday, but I thought 
since this is such a fast moving issue it was best to get this tool out so it 
could be used when needed. If you have any questions, please call me at 
713-853-4382.

Thanks,

Gavin

Reuters Article: 8/30/2000
Hopes for a smooth national transition to deregulated electricity markets 
have faded this summer, thanks largely to soaring prices in California where 
a free market proved nothing close to free.

- A seemingly noncontroversial bill that would continue a state 
energy-efficiency program faces a surprise obstacle: Gov. Gray Davis. 
The measure by Assemblyman Roderick Wright, a Los Angeles Democrat, would 
extend for 10 years a 3.5 percent surcharge on all electric-utility bills in 
California. 

Many other articles have been posted onto California Intranet Site.

Attached are some articles concerning further development and elaboration on 
the California power crisis and testimony to the Senate Energy, Utilities and 
Communications Committee by the CEO of CAL-ISO concerning the power 
issues/problems.

Testimony before Senate Energy, Utilities & Communications Committee And the 
Assembly Utilities & Commerce Committee
By Terry M. Winter, President and CEO
California Independent System Operator
August 10, 2000




An August 10th article from Natural Gas Intelligence that talks of the 
defensive posture the California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) has 
taken concerning the accusations that Governor Davis' emergency electricity 
report had made about the new deregulated market. 



An article from Natural Gas Intelligence talks about the vote, on July 31st,  
by the California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) Board to move the 
price cap to $250. The pros and cons of the price cap are mentioned, as well 
as other remedies for the power situation. Also, there are several comments 
in the article from California Senator Steve Peace on how "dysfunctional" the 
market is and why it should be restructured.

Utilagent Now Provides 20% Electricity Savings for California Residences. 


?

PR Newswire 



(Copyright (c) 2000, PR Newswire)

PISMO BEACH, Calif., Sept. 6 /PRNewswire/ -- Utilagent, a California based 
utility services company, announced that it now provides a 20% electricity 
savings for all PG&E, Edison, and SDG&E residential accounts throughout 
California. The savings come directly from the actual cost of the electricity 
and is deducted from the "electric energy" charges as shown on one's utility 
bill. 
"California residents have seen their electricity bills skyrocket instead of 
decline and view this deregulation process as a confusing, dismal failure", 
says Robert Kramb, manager of Utilagent. "In addition, except for microscopic 
print found on electricity bills, regarding alternative suppliers, little has 
been done by the Public Utilities Commission and utility companies to educate 
Californian's about their purchase options. Utilagent has simply decided to 
take the guesswork out of the process." 
?


Utilagent provides Californian's with an on-line approach for the 20% 
savings. Their web site http://www.electricityderegulation.com uses a 
one-page, one-minute, sign-up form where a resident enters their utility 
information and payment option. The entire process is done on-line, and there 
are no fees (either switching or cancellation), no deposits, and no long-term 
contracts. 
"Utilagent scours the utility market place for the best programs that provide 
the best utility savings for the most people, and we are pleased to promote 
Utility.com as the ESP (electric service provider) in California. Those 
signing up through Utilagent receive their same electricity and utility 
services as they have in the past, but pay 20% less for their electric 
energy, the way electricity deregulation is meant to be", claims Kramb.

A scathing AP article against Governor Davis concerning his inaction with the 
California crisis. Davis is facing two issues. Sign the current rollback bill 
that is going through the legislature and upset the energy industry, or veto 
the bill and have many voters upset at him. Governor Davis is aware of the 
upcoming elections for members in his party, as well as the 2002 governor 
election and knows that his decision may cost himself and other members of 
his party election wins. Also, there is now talks that during August 21st PUC 
meeting the governor will suggest rate rollback for San Diego  to July 1998 
rates. This is a complete 180 degree turn from his August 3rd PUC meeting 
where he said he would steer clear of rate rollbacks or freezes and push for 
only a rebate.


Attached is a personal interest type story providing the general publics view 
of the whole California power situation.

North Carolina Residents Debate Deregulation of Electricity 
Paul B. Johnson

09/05/2000 
KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: High Point Enterprise - North 
Carolina 



Copyright (C) 2000 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World 
Reporter (TM) 
?

?
Donald Ratliffe doesn't know the intimate details over the complex debate 
over whether to deregulate the sale of electricity to millions of customers 
in North Carolina. 
But the 57-year-old mechanic from Kernersville said he does know enough to 
boil the issue down to a proverbial phrase if it ain't broke, don't fix it. 
?


"Anytime they've seemed to deregulate something, it becomes a big mess," 
Ratliffe said, referring to the deregulation of fields such as the airline 
and telephone industries. Change can be good, but it's not always good." 
Answering questions recently as part of an informal survey of men and women 
in the Triad, Ratliffe said the current monopoly system for electric service 
suits him. 
"When you think about what you get for your money, it's still a great buy," 
he said. 
Ratliffe was one of the people interviewed recently by the High Point 
Enterprise on their thoughts about whether the state should reform the 
$8-billion-a-year electric industry. Members of the Study Commission on the 
Future of Electric Service in N.C. have spent the past three years dealing 
with analysts, lobbyists and industry representatives on how to approach the 
intricate issue. In April, the 29-member commission approved recommendations 
that include deregulating the sale of electricity starting in 2005, with full 
implementation in 2006. The commission will resume its meetings in Raleigh 
Sept. 14, with the goal of coming up with legislation that could be proposed 
for the 2001 General Assembly session. 
State legislators will have the final say on whether to deregulate an 
industry that has functioned under a monopoly system for virtually a century. 
The response of people answering questions posed by the Enterprise was 
similar to the opinions expressed two years ago when eight public hearings 
were held across the state on electric deregulation. Approximately 1,850 
people attended the meetings, according to a report prepared for the 
commission. 
"Many people expressed serious concerns about restructuring, without 
expressing a definite opinion either `for' or `against' it," reported the 
consultant that prepared the commission's report on the information gathered 
at the hearings. 
The debate over deregulation carries special significance for High Point 
because of the monumental level of municipal power debts. 
The study commission hasn't come up with a specific plan to address the $5.5 
billion debt. The city of High Point has municipal power debts of 
approximately $430 million, the fourth-highest amount among the 51 towns and 
cities in the state that run their own electric distribution systems. 
Several proposals considered by the commission would compel the 51 cities and 
towns to sell their power distribution systems, with the revenue going toward 
debt relief. 
For Avis Murphy of High Point, the topic of deregulation prompts her to 
envision potential benefits and pitfalls. 
The 25-year-old retail manager said having more options to pick her family's 
power provider should lead to better service and prices because of 
competition. 
But she can also see people being taken advantage of if the government 
doesn't have some oversight to prevent price gouging. Murphy suggested having 
what would amount to a social safety net if deregulation takes place, such as 
putting a cap on how much rates can go up during a certain period of time 
among companies providing service. 
Many men and women interviewed by the Enterprise said they didn't want a 
deregulated electric industry to become a day-to-day telemarketing and sales 
pitch drudgery. 
Lou Damron of High Point and her friend enjoying lunch rolled their eyes when 
asked if they would mind getting telemarketing calls from power companies as 
they do now from telecommunication companies. 
"Whenever they do something like this, it always gets more complicated," said 
59-year-old retiree. "I like the way it is now I don't have to worry about 
it." 
Retiree Johnnie Alexander of High Point said that she wouldn't want 
deregulation to interfere with her ability to have an equalized payment plan, 
which allows her to keep her payments the same through the year. 
"I like the way it is now," the 67year-old woman said. 
Some people expressed an interest in deregulation if it would lead to better 
prices. 
Competition could be an improvement because companies would offer lower rates 
to lure customers, said 69-year-old retiree John Cochran of High Point. Also, 
a competitive market may compel more companies to build new power plants to 
meet the demand of a growing base of customers, Cochran said. 
"It always a better when there's an open marketplace," said 26-yearold 
financial specialist Phillip Carter of Advance, who works in High Point. "I'm 
a firm believer in capitalism and the free market." 
One challenge that officials face in reforming the electric industry is the 
wide disparity in the customer base and amount of electricity used per 
customer in North Carolina. 
Of the approximately 4 million electric customers in the state, 87 percent 
are residential customers. About 12 percent are commercial customers, meaning 
owners of shopping centers and office buildings, with about 1 percent 
industrial customers, such as manufacturers. 
However, the vast majority of electricity is used by the least number of 
customers. 
For example, for Carolina Power & Light Co., less than 1 percent of its 
customers use 25 percent of the power that the utility generates. Put another 
way, of CP&L's 1.2 million customers, the top 50 virtually all industries use 
25 percent of the utility's energy, CP&L reports. 
The disparity in the scope of customers and in how much electricity various 
types of customers use make it challenging to come up with a competitive rate 
structure where all types of customers benefit, said Charles Harman, a Duke 
University mechanical engineering professor. 
"What's going to happen with deregulation is that people with market clout 
are going to be able to negotiate better deals than people without market 
clout," said Harman, who has an expertise in electric industry issues. 
That means ordinary people may find that deregulation won't have any 
noticeable effect on what they pay each month to a utility, Harman said.

Wattage Monitor Service Teams Help Lower Electric Bills 

SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 21 /PRNewswire/ -- As summer temperatures continue to
heat up and electricity prices do the same, Wattage Monitor Inc.
(OTC Bulletin Board: WMON) offers consumers an escape by locating a
competitive supplier that can lower their bills.
    Customers of San Diego Gas & Electric can choose to buy electric power
from 14 other companies besides their regulated utility.  Most of these
competing companies allow Wattage Monitor system users to switch to their
service automatically.  And there are savings to be had.  In some cases
competing suppliers are offering as much as $120 per year in savings or more.
    "With the surge in power prices has come great interest in saving on
electric bills," notes Gerald R. Alderson, President of Wattage Monitor.  "In
response we have expanded our service, sent consumer service teams to
San Diego to help consumers choose a supplier and have made it easier to
switch on-line at http://www.wattagemonitor.com or through our toll-free 
service
reached by calling 1-888-WATTAGE," he added.
    The California electricity market is in a significant transition from a
regulated market to a competitive one.  But like telephone long-distance
service, a consumer must switch to a competing supplier to lower their bill.
As consumers increasingly become aware that they have a choice and switch,
competition is expected to produce even greater savings.  But consumers must
act to realize the savings available.
    Wattage Monitor is a nationwide, free to consumers service that offers
residential and commercial electric consumers their specific electric service
options through its website http://www.wattagemonitor.com or its toll-free 
service
888-WATTAGE.  Consumers may also easily and conveniently enroll with the
supplier of their choice.  Competing electric suppliers' rates and services
are posted by zip code.  Simple, straightforward, comparative and all in one
place.

Attached is an article from the San Diego Union-Tribune stating that a good 
solution for the power crisis is energy conservation through the use of 
real-time meters. By using the real time meters, consumers will have better 
knowledge of energy prices and be less likely to use as much power during 
peak times, thus bringing demand into line with current supply. Is there a 
way for EES or the New Energy Company to take advantage of this type of 
opportunity through their energy management products?

Following is an excerpt from a LA Times article illustrating a different, 
more negative point of view concerning deregulation compared to earlier 
articles I had sent. 
The whole article is attached at the bottom. 

 
Overconfident lawmakers even inserted as Section 330A of the Public Utilities 
Code: "It is the intent of the Legislature that a cumulative 
rate reduction of at least 20% be achieved not later than April 1, 2002, for 
residential and small commercial customers from the rates
 in effect on June 10, 1996."

Fat chance! And under deregulation, with production of electricity in 
independent hands, separated from the major utilities,
 there is a division of responsibility: When things go wrong, it is nearly 
impossible to assess whom to blame.

So where do we go from here?

Already, while ostensibly resisting re-regulation, utility officials are 
suggesting they need help. This is not surprising. Deregulation
 is one of the most oversold concepts in American life. Without a continued 
government hand, things frequently run off the tracks.

When John E. Bryson, chief of Edison, came last week to The Times to meet 
with reporters and editorial writers, he expressed 
mystification that market prices have been so high, even at times when demand 
is relatively low.

He called for a federal investigation of the price levels.

In the meantime, he and aides suggested, some price ceilings might be 
temporarily 
in order.

I suspect they might not be all that temporary.

If after joining in a $40-million utilities campaign to defeat a quixotic 
ballot initiative that would have stifled
 deregulation, Edison leaders are now proposing so much regulation, it shows 
not only a commendable candor but also 
how grim they realize the immediate prospects are.

U.S. lawmakers should give federal regulators more authority to help right 
the shaky electricity industry restructuring process, according to a former 
U.S. congressman. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and not individual state agencies, 
should oversee the siting process for new power plants and interstate 
transmission line developments, former U.S. Rep Phil Sharp, an Indiana 
Democrat, said Tuesday at a Chicago conference.

DON'T BLAME DEREGULATION FOR SUMMER'S `BROWNOUTS' 
THE ECONOMIST\

This has been a miserable summer in California. Thanks to a surge in 
electricity consumption, Californians and other Americans have endured 
several power failures. 
Since brownouts were rare in the past, some wonder if recent steps to 
liberalize the power market are to blame. Politicians are meddling, 
arbitrarily imposing rate freezes and price caps. This week President Bill 
Clinton offered federal subsidies to poor people and small firms hit by 
higher power prices in California. 
?


A growing chorus is arguing that electricity deregulation has gone too far 
and too fast. The problem is just the opposite. The real culprits behind this 
summer's power failures are the muddle and hesitation surrounding the 
introduction of competition in much of America. 
In places such as Britain, Scandinavia and Australia, which began 
liberalizing long ago, the transition to competitive power has been orderly 
and free of mishap; consumers there enjoy reliable power, lower prices and 
better service. 
California's deregulation has failed to yield such gains largely because it 
neglected a variety of market realities. 
Companies will invest in generation only if the rules of the game are clear. 
In America, they seldom are. That is partly because of the country's federal 
structure, which has left the states to take the initiative in electricity 
deregulation. 
About half have opened up their markets, but each has its own peculiarities. 
This patchwork, plus changing environmental regulation, explains why so many 
utilities have avoided building new plants for years. 
State governments should base reforms on clear and consistent rules. The 
federal government also needs to bring order to interstate power trading. 
Regulators must break the monopoly of the aging and overloaded distribution 
system. 
Merely generating more power at big central plants far from markets means 
little unless it can reach consumers - and bottlenecks on the grid mean that 
not enough of it does. Expanding distribution capacity is often impossible in 
crowded urban areas, and elsewhere people dislike new power lines. 
Dramatic advances in technologies such as fuel cells and microturbines, which 
generate power efficiently and cleanly on a smaller scale, may make up the 
shortfall. But regulators still tend to imagine that power will flow in one 
direction only: from big plants to small consumers. 
To ease the bottlenecks, they should follow the recent move by New York state 
to facilitate access to the grid for small micropower plants. 
The other area of reform is the hardest but also the most crucial: the 
consumer market. 
In the long run, liberalization and competition will deliver lower 
electricity prices for companies and households alike. However, in many 
places, retail prices remain fixed by government fiat. 
There is a case for protecting domestic households from price volatility 
until a genuinely competitive retail market emerges. However, the zeal with 
which politicians have introduced arbitrary price "rollbacks" suggests that 
they may turn any exception into the rule. 
This would be a mistake, for unless consumers see fluctuations in prices 
(especially at peak times), they have no incentive to conserve power or shift 
their use off-peak. 
The right way forward is to allow retail prices to fluctuate with market 
conditions. This will encourage consumers to use power more judiciously and 
speed the arrival of such innovations as fixed-price "energy service" 
contracts, which promise outcomes such as certain levels of heating, rather 
than merely delivery of a set amount of electricity. 
Price transparency will also allow micropower plants to buy and sell power on 
the grid as demand dictates, so improving the grid's reliability. 
In fits and starts, America is heading toward the promise of competitive 
energy markets. Consumers in Pennsylvania, for example, now pay $3 billion a 
year less for their electricity than they did before 1999. 
The populism and shortsightedness of its regulators and politicians must not 
stop California from getting there, too.

CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- Stumbling points in California's deregulated power 
markets this summer need to be explored urgently to avoid nationwide 
electricity restructuring problems, a key U.S federal regulator said Tuesday. 
"There is a crisis of confidence in our electricity markets," said Bill 
Massey, a commissioner with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
addressing a Chicago conference. 
There is concern that California's early restructuring problems will throw 
into disarray deregulation progress in other states. 
?


"As California goes, so goes the country," Massey said. 
Heat waves have sparked strong demand in California this summer, and a lack 
of adequate power supplies have led to soaring wholesale power prices. 
Customers in San Diego have been exposed to these price surges, and many have 
seen retail rates more than double.

GOVERNOR DAVIS PRESSES FERC FOR ACTION ON WHOLESALE POWER RATES: Calls on
Federal Regulators to Reduce Prices, Issue Refunds

GOVERNOR DAVIS NAMES KAHN CHAIR OF THE GOVERNOR'S CLEAN ENERGY GREEN TEAM



OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 12, 2000

GOVERNOR DAVIS PRESSES FERC FOR ACTION ON WHOLESALE POWER RATES
Calls on Federal Regulators to Reduce Prices, Issue Refunds

SAN DIEGO - At a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) hearing today
in San Diego, Governor Gray Davis reiterated his call to federal regulators
to intervene "to the fullest extent possible" to lower electricity prices in
California.

"FERC bears responsibility to ensure that a workably competitive market
exists before California consumers and California's economy are subjected to
unconstrained, market-based electricity prices," said Governor Davis in a
statement read by Energy Oversight Board Chairman Michael Kahn.
"Consequently, I renew my prior request that the Commission act with utmost
speed to intervene to the fullest extent possible to restore wholesale
prices to fair levels and to remedy harms that have resulted from the
exercise of market power."

Governor Davis noted that he and state lawmakers have taken dramatic action
in recent weeks to provide rate relief. "While these actions should provide
short-term rate predictability and longer-term benefits to customers in
terms of improved supplies, the fundamental problem of exorbitant wholesale
prices still exists and remains the responsibility of FERC to address," said
the governor. "No combination of state actions can substitute for federal
action to ameliorate the problems of California's wholesale markets."

Governor Davis has taken the following actions in reaction to rising
electricity prices in San Diego:

On June 14, he called for emergency reduction of electricity use by all
state facilities in the San Francisco Bay area in response to electricity
emergency and rolling blackouts.

On June 15, he called on chairpersons of the Public Utilities Commission
(PUC) to analyze the conditions that led to electricity shortages in the San
Francisco Bay area the previous day, including a statewide perspective on
the price and delivery of electricity. Report was completed, submitted to
the governor and released on August 2.

On July 27, 2000, Governor Davis called on federal and state regulators to
take swift action to extend the caps on wholesale electric rates in
California and provide San Diego ratepayers with million of dollars in
refunds.

In letters written by the governor to two state regulatory agencies and two
California-based panels charged with overseeing California's power market,
he called for a coordinated state effort to urge federal regulators to take
strong measures to reduce power rates in both the short- and long-term.

On August 2, 2000, Governor Davis issued three Executive Orders designed to
reduce energy consumption by state government and speed up the time it takes
new power generating facilities to win approval from state agencies.

On August 9, 2000, Governor Davis called on the Public Utilities Commission
(PUC) to establish a two-year plan that would cut electricity rates by
nearly half for residential and business customers of San Diego Gas &
Electric.

The governor also reached an agreement with the California Grocers
Association that will save enough electricity to provide power to between
50,000 and 60,000 homes during periods of peak demand, as grocers agreed to
reduce power consumption by 10 percent during Stage One emergencies.

On August 10, 2000, Governor Davis wrote a letter to President Clinton
urging him to expedite FERC's investigation to determine whether current
electric rates in San Diego were unjust.

On August 22, 2000, Governor Davis called on President Clinton to release
emergency funds from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)
to the state to help low-income Californians pay their rapidly-rising
electricity bills.

On August 23, 2000, President Clinton responded to Governor Davis' request
by releasing $2.6 million in emergency funds to help low-income Southern
Californians cope with the surge in their electricity bills. The President
also asked federal regulators to speed up their investigation into the
operation of U.S. power markets and urged the Small Business Administration
to use its credit programs to help small firms hurt by the price increases.

On August 23, 2000, Governor Davis reached agreement with legislators on
legislation to provide relief to San Diego ratepayers. The governor signed
two bills into law on September 6, 2000.

Please see attached letter (below).

SEPTEMBER 12, 2000

STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS

TO THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION CONCERNING ITS INVESTIGATION OF
WHOLESALE PRICE ESCALATION IN CALIFORNIA

The Summer of 2000 has confronted California with an electricity crisis that
seriously threatens the safety, health and well being of citizens and
businesses throughout the state. At the heart of the crisis is the
extraordinary run up in prices for wholesale electric energy and ancillary
services, accompanied by deteriorating service and reliability. In San
Diego, electric customers' bills have more than doubled this summer,
threatening permanent harm to businesses and the health and welfare of
residential customers in the warm southern climate. All remaining California
electric consumers are faced with similar prospects as their legislated rate
freeze periods come to an end. In San Francisco we saw rolling blackouts for
the first time in our history.

As soon as the dimensions of the crisis became evident, I directed
California regulators, including the Public Utilities Commission and the
Electricity Oversight Board, and the Independent System Operator, to take
immediate steps to identify and implement specific measures to mitigate the
damage, including restoring price caps at Summer 1999 levels. I am happy to
report that those measures have been adopted, although not without
considerable resistance from self-interested parties.

In recent weeks, I have worked with the California Legislature to enact
further relief within the existing framework of options now available to the
state. These include provisions to stabilize retail rates, expedite
generation licensing where possible, implement targeted demand reduction and
demand response and remove constraints in transmission and distribution
systems. I have also established a task force comprised of key state
officials which is developing measures to increase energy efficiency and
alternative supplies and to expedite permitting by state agencies.

While these actions should provide short-term rate predictability and
longer-term benefits to customers in terms of improved supplies, the
fundamental problem of exorbitant wholesale prices still exists and remains
the responsibility of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to address.
No combination of state actions can substitute for federal action to
ameliorate the problems in California's wholesale markets.

A joint report submitted to me on August 2nd by the Chairman of the
California Electricity Oversight Board and the President of the California
Public Utilities Commission concluded that exorbitant wholesale prices in
California result from wholesale market dysfunction and the exercise of
market power by sellers. Subsequent reports by the Market Analysis
Department and the Market Surveillance Committee of the California
Independent System Operator reach the same conclusions. Subsequent behavior
of wholesale electric prices during August confirms their conclusions, and
subjects California to further economic damage. While I remain hopeful that
California wholesale markets may ultimately become competitive and become
capable of serving the interests of consumers and the public, I cannot and
will not accept the liabilities to California that result from the current
situation for even a short period. I intend to take any and all steps
necessary to restore economic stability to the electric service
infrastructure of California.

FERC bears the responsibility under its organic act to assure just and
reasonable wholesale electric rates. FERC bears responsibility to ensure
that a workably competitive market exists before California consumers and
California's economy are subjected to unconstrained, market-based
electricity prices. Consequently, I renew my prior request that the
Commission act with utmost speed to intervene to the fullest extent possible
to restore wholesale prices to fair levels and to remedy harms that have
resulted from the exercise of market power.

Attached are more articles that speak of the current California power crisis.

Mercury News Article primarily dealing with Governor Davis' view on the 
situation and what he is doing to help solve the issue. Davis has a three 
part plan: investigate price gouging, ask PUC to set up two-year plan to cut 
rates in half and asked for voluntary conservation. 

Asking Clinton to speed up a federal probe of apparent electricity 
price-gouging by out-of-state power producers and called on state regulators; 
A spokesman for the independent energy producers said his group welcomed a 
federal investigation, saying it would determine that ``California simply 
does not have enough generating and transmission capacity.'' 
To stabilize skyrocketing utility bills in San Diego; Davis called upon the 
Public Utilities Commission on Wednesday to set up a two-year plan to cut 
rates nearly in half for residential and business customers of San Diego Gas 
& Electric.  Davis described his proposal as ``a rate-stabilization plan'' 
designed to lower bills. ;Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility 
Reform Network, a consumer group, criticized Davis' plan. She said consumer 
groups want the Legislature to freeze rates in San Diego at July 1999 levels. 
Volunary actions: Davis joined with grocers to announce a voluntary program 
to conserve power on extremely hot days, meaning lights in Bay Area 
supermarkets would be dimmed and air conditioning dials set higher to cut 
power use by 10 percent. 
Davis contends that deregulation will work out, perhaps in three or four 
years, when a dozen or more power plants in the pipeline start generating 
electricity. 



Mercury News article states it is not time to re-regulate the markets and 
provides the following solutions to solve the crisis.
Matters will improve when California has: 
-> More sources of power. 
-> A more sophisticated electricity market. 
-> Smarter consumers -- that is, consumers with the information they need to 
be thrifty. 
Also the article talks of the Power Exchange (PX) and the Independent System 
Operators (ISO) and how these two groups are making the prices higher; i.e 
market imperfections that result from the uniqueness of electricity as a 
commodity and the immaturity of the new exchanges are enabling producers to 
obtain higher prices than the underlying conditions dictate. 
Article concludes by saying the deregulated market is just beginning and with 
a few adjustments will work out fine


Mercury News article speaking of a new report commissioned by Governor Davis 
on the energy crisis. The article is primarily about the following issues.
A report commissioned by Gov. Gray Davis concluded that deregulation is ``not 
working,'' and recommended a series of actions, including asking the federal 
government to help control prices. 
The report was written by the president of the California Public Utilities 
Commission and the chairman of the California Electricity Oversight Board and 
made 30 recommendations to help ease the threat of power shortages and price 
spikes. 
Report suggested that  the state-mandated freeze on utility rates, which is 
tentatively in place for PG&E customers through March 2002, might need to be 
extended further. 
The report also suggested the upgrading power transmission lines into San 
Francisco and  hooking up businesses to a central command center via the 
Internet, so their lobby lights and air conditioning could be turned off 
automatically when state power supplies were low. 
Two key state agencies, the Independent System Operator and the Power 
Exchange, were criticized in the report. It accused the ISO and the Power 
Exchangeof being unresponsive to the needs of consumers, in part because 
their boards include people with ties to power companies. It also complained 
that they did not provide key pricing and other data requested by the 
report's authors to assess the state's energy problems.
Also in the article is a repsonse by the ISO and PX to the claims made in the 
governor's report.

EDITORIAL 

CONSUMERS GET DEREG HOMEWORK

?
WITH ELECTRIC DEREGULATION coming Jan. 1, Ohioans are about to be bombarded 
with information about how to buy their power. Soon, companies will be able 
to compete to sell electricity, although Dayton Power & Light still will 
transmit electricity to area homes and stores. 
Prices, now regulated by state government, will be set by the market. No one 
knows precisely what will happen. What is known: The issues are technical. 
Some who understand them, such as power companies, have neither incentive nor 
obligation to guide consumers to the best deal. 
?


That's why the Ohio General Assembly ordered a five-year, $33 million 
consumer education effort. It was designed by the Public Utilities Commission 
of Ohio; the Ohio Consumers' Counsel, the state agency meant to be a liaison 
between utilities and their customers; and the Ohio Electric Utility 
Institute, representing utilities. 
Their "Ohio Electric Choice" campaign includes a 12-page consumer guide, a 
toll-free hot line and, starting Oct. 1, a Web site, www.Ohio 
ElectricChoice.com. 
Any objective help for electric power consumers has to be to the good. But 
here are a few facts also worth remembering: 
* Power companies hope to retain as many residential customers as possible; 
their marketing should be viewed with that in mind. 
* Consumer groups fought to have the new law let people band together to 
negotiate better rates. Local governments are among the most logical 
bargaining agents - but they must get voter approval to assume that role. 
Dayton Power & Light officials have characterized this as "government getting 
involved in private industry," but it remains among individuals' best hope of 
achieving any bargaining power with utilities. Residents should demand that 
their local government officials discuss providing this essential service. 
Change often can be confusing; this is no exception. But at least Ohioans 
have been given a place to start their education as painlessly as possible. 
Now they should remember that while learning to choose may be annoying, it 
still may be preferable to leaving the choice - and the benefits - to someone 
else.

- California Gov. Gray Davis on Wednesday signed emergency legislation to cut 
electricity rates in San Diego where a tripling in customers' bills this 
summer has sparked a public outcry. 


Enron Corp. (ENE) executives Wednesday called for swift federal action to 
reform the U.S. wholesale power market and avert chronic power-supply 
problems nationally, such as the high-profile woes that plagued the 
California electricity market this summer. 



California Utilities Reap Huge Profits Amid Record-High Energy Bills 



In the seemingly long-ago 1990s, when California had electrons to spare and 
energy was the last issue on most people's minds, San Diego Gas & Electric 
tried to expand a 700-megawatt power plant in Chula Vista--and met with stony 
indifference from local government types. 
The attitude bespoke the not-in-my-backyard opposition that such projects 
typically have faced around the state. SDG&E shelved the plan. 
But the current is flowing the other way now: The state is in the midst of an 
electricity crisis, and the San Diego bedroom community is urging the plant's 
new operator not just to keep the facility running but, indeed, to make it 
bigger.

State officials approve electricity deregulation plan

CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - Most state residents will see a 5 percent drop in 
electricity rates next month, the first step toward a 15.5 percent decrease, 
under a plan approved Tuesday by state utility regulators. 
The Public Utilities Commission hasn't yet issued a written order, but voted 
unanimously to approve an amended plan that conforms with the wide-ranging 
deregulation bill the Legislature passed this year. 
?


Public Service Company President Gary Long said if there are no appeals, and 
no problems in the details of the written order, customers should be seeing a 
16 percent rate drop by the end of the year. 
Part of that reduction will be a 5 percent cut by Oct. 1. 
Most New Hampshire homeowners would save about $13 off a typical monthly 
electric bill under a 15.5 percent rate decrease. 
Granite State Electric and the New Hampshire Electric Cooperative already 
have restructured themselves to allow their combined 100,000 customers to buy 
power from other companies.

California governor signs 2 measures to deal with power crisis

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Legislation meant to ease the burden of power rate 
spikes in Southern California and help avert future energy shortages in the 
state were signed into law Wednesday by Gov. Gray Davis. 
One measure spreads energy price increases over several years, and the other 
speeds the approval process for new power plants. Davis deferred action on a 
third, politically delicate bill, which would use taxpayer money to defray 
the costs of rate increases in excess of 10 percent. 
?


"This is not the last step we have to take to solve this problem, but it's a 
very important first step," the Democrat said. 
Opponents said the governor was approving merely a stop-gap solution for the 
state's energy crisis. 
"It is a quick political fix that puts on layaway today's high energy costs 
until 2003 or 2004," said Doug Kline, a spokesman for San Diego Gas and 
Electric. "The law is designed to get the politicians past the next 
election." 
Both measures would take effect immediately if they receive endorsement from 
the Public Utilities Commission, which meets Thursday, the governor's office 
said. 
San Diego residents have seen their electric bills soar since rates were 
deregulated in June. Deregulation was meant to lower prices, but demand for 
electricity has outstripped supply because of a growing population, a booming 
high-tech economy, and less power available from neighboring states that 
haven't deregulated. 
The utility commission last month cut rates for most San Diego residents by 
43 percent in response to outcry over rising prices. 
Under the first measure, rates for residential users would be capped at 6.5 
cents per kilowatt hour, dropping the average monthly residential utility 
bill from $120 to $68. Customers would receive rebates for energy use for 
which they were charged more than 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour after June 1. 
The measure seeks to avert causing San Diego Gas and Electric losses, but the 
company said customers would face rate hikes in 2003 or 2004 to make up for 
projected losses of $839 million stemming from the new law.

Enron President: Summer Power Market Woes To Widen Dereg Gulf 
By James Covert 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
?
09/06/2000 
Dow Jones Energy Service 



(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
?

?
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The disasters that have hit states with deregulated 
retail power markets this summer are likely to widen a regulatory gulf 
between those states and the rest of the country, said Jeffrey Skilling, 
president of Houston-based Enron Corp. (ENE). 
Wholesale power price spikes this summer sent bills for retail customers of 
Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric Co. soaring to two to three 
times their previous levels, as deregulated market prices were passed on to 
them. In New York, bills for customers of Consolidated Edison Co. (ED) of New 
York jumped by more than 40% under a similar arrangement, although the summer 
was by some accounts the mildest in more than a hundred years. 
?


These developments haven't done much for the reputation of electric 
deregulation in states that have thus far sat on the sidelines, Skilling 
said. 
But the states that have already set the ball rolling - including deregulated 
and disaster-ridden California - will probably step up their efforts to 
develop and repair their flawed markets, Skilling told an energy conference 
on Wednesday. 
"If a state hasn't already deregulated, they're going to be more hesitant to 
do so at this point," Skilling said. "But if they've already started, there's 
no going back. They've got to deal with the problem." 
Skilling puts about 40% of the U.S. retail markets in the former category, 
predicting that their skittishness will necessitate federal prodding if those 
markets are to become deregulated in the next few years. 
In the meantime, Skilling said he sees a nunmber of "quick fixes" on the 
regulatory side that could do much to improve wholesale market conditions for 
the other 60% that have started down the rocky road of deregulation. And with 
political pressure mounting, regulators at both the state and federal levels 
are becoming quicker about pushing these through, he said. 
These include the streamlining of power plant siting processes, and the 
elimination of monopolized power transmission systems through the creation of 
independent transmission companies and operators. 
That will improve the access of generators to power-starved markets in 
California and elsewhere, and ultimately help reduce prices, Skilling said. 
"California has added 5,000 or 6,000 megawatts of demand over the past four 
years," Skilling said. "We've got 11,000 megawatts of generation that's been 
proposed, and we're going to need to step up the process for getting that 
cited." 
Another important part of developing young retail markets is to introduce 
customers to real-time pricing, so that they can track the fluctuations of 
the volatile wholesale power market on a real-time basis, and better manage 
their risk, Skilling said. 
"Real-time pricing is essential for the the development of any retail 
market," Skilling said. "That's when we're going to start to see the peak 
(power demand) shaving and customer savings."

SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The timetable for deregulation of Nevada's 
electricity market will be examined at a special meeting Sept. 13, called by 
Gov. Kenny Guinn (R) with state Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Chairman 
Don Soderberg, a spokesman for Guinn said Wednesday. 
Nevada's electricity market was to open to competition last March but Guinn 
delayed the timing because final rules weren't in place.

The state's new timetable now calls for deregulation to be phased in for 
various classes of utility customers from Nov. 1, 2000, for big industrial 
companies, to residential consumers by the end of 2001. 
Soderberg told Reuters the timetable is subject to the governor's approval. 
"I have no indication that he is uncomfortable with the schedule, but we will 
meet to discuss all issues on deregulation," he said. 
The state PUC has studied the power problems Nevada's neighbour California 
has grappled with since electricity deregulation went into effect in 1998. 
Soderberg said, however, that California's problems, which are based mainly 
on supply and demand factors, don't necessarily mean that Nevada will delay 
further.
