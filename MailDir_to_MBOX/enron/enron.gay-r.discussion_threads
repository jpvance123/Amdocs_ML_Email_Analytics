Jose, I think the supplemental info you have provided is outstanding and 
helpful to the lenders in understanding the overall picture and the history.  
However, its focus is not the central concern of the lenders at this point as 
I understand it.  The lenders and their counsel are concerned specifically 
about third party liability meaning, I believe, lawsuits or claims from 
parties who did not receive power because Cuiaba failed to generate.  
Therefore, I think the questions which Tozzinni needs to address are along 
the lines of:

1) If EPE is required to sign the agreements by ANEEl, What is the extent of 
damages that could be claimed in the context of such agreements?

2) Could any consequential damages be assessed?

3) Could EPE excuse itself from the legal proceedings on the basis of the bid 
documents, the PPA or other agreements with Furnas, Electronote or Eletrabras?

4) How would the economic equilibrium process work in the case of a judgement 
which was payable by EPE?  Could the process be expedited to avert a 
liquidity crisis?

5) Could EPE be denied access to the grid as a result of failure to cover a 
spot market price assessed by the MAE stemming from an unscheduled outage?  

6) Similarly, could EPE incur penalties or be denied transmission if they 
failed to contribute in accordance with the shared liability provisions of 
the agreements?

7) Will we need to sign the agreements for other reasons (such as access to 
back-up power) which would be excluded from the protections by Furnas under 
the PPA?

9) Could Furnas deny or delay reimbursement if the amount is not recoverable 
by them or while they are awaiting word on a claims recoverability?

10) A question for insurance - Does our Business Interuption insurance 
protect us in any of these instances?  (Note: the US$20MM Sponsor liquidity 
facility provides some comfort to the lenders)


John, stop me if you think I am off track.  If you have other questions which 
you think need to be addressed please continue ....

Rob
I just realized that Monday is a holiday for  us so we will not be able to
have our conference call then.

We have scheduled one between the lenders and Bob Shapiro for Tues. am.
(2/20).   I propose that we schedule one after that with you, KFW & OPIC at
10:00am Tuesday.    The timing of all of this subject to no conflict with
Frank's schedule, and he is out today.

Let me know if 10am on Tuesday works for you and your team.

Have a good weekend.
Barbara

Cliff,
Did we ever produce this?  I thought we decided to wait and see if we were 
going to use bonds.  If it exists, is there any reason why a potential buyer 
of Cuiaba should not see it?

Tracee - There is documentation on the KFW hedge as you know.  The only thing 
we could provide on the OPIC loan is a requirement of the lenders to be fixed 
which would be in the CTA if it was required in this instance (or the other 
OPIC documents).  It could be that the only requirement was in the OPIC FOGA 
which originally required us to be fixed within 12 months of funding.  
However, we modified this and now we must select either a Citibank bank loan 
which would be fixed prior to funding by a swap or if we issue bonds they 
will be fixed rate.  Please see FOGA.

Rob said there are no agreements in place so we need to provide a written

In addition we were asked to provide a copy of the Citibank offering memo for

I was just trying to touch base after the lender call this morning and 
debrief.  I thought you and John were great, particularly John's step-in on 
the heat rate/degradation issue.  Thanks to both of you.

I also wanted to visit on the latest plan for the ridges.

Thirdly, I wanted to discuss your thoughts on the achievability of our 
positions with SCC and Siemens.

Finally, we should circle up on the TAA once we get Cliff's response.  He led 
me to believe that we really had little to fear in the discussion I had with 
him.

Regards

Rob

Joe,

Late last year Lucy Ortiz gave me your name as the contact regarding gas 
sales under the APEA contract.  I have also been coordinating with Randy Gay 
in our Houston office regarding payments and deliveries.

We have been notified by Coral Energy, representing the City of Glendale, 
that effective December 1, 2000, Glendale wants to receive their entire 
quantity (4,178 MMBtu/d) at the Nova Inventory Transfer ("NIT") point.  This 
point is located in Alberta and will be supplied by Enron's Calgary office.

Can you please notify Chase Manhattan, for purposes of settling the swaps 
associated with this transaction, to settle at NIT for December 2001 and 
beyond, unless another notice is issued to us.

If you no longer have responsibility for managing these issues, could you 
please forward this to the correct person.

Thanks,

Laird Dyer (415.782.7805)

Subject: revision to Path Manager Auto Refresh

Based on feedback from multi-scheduler pipes, the refreshing of paths can 
tend to slow down the other scheduer on the same pipe.  This is especially 
noticeable when many paths are changed at once.  Even if it takes 1 - 2 
seconds to refresh a path, changing 20 - 30 paths could cause the other 
scheduler on that pipe to wait for 30 - 45 seconds.

We are developing a revised Auto Refresh option to let the scheduler pick 
whether they want Deal changes or Path changes (or both or neither).  To the 
scheduler, it will simply be a change on the Path Manager filter to replace 
the "Auto Refresh" checkbox with two checkboxes:
 - Auto Refresh Deals
 - Auto Refresh Paths
Once selected, this will be the default selection for the duration of that 
Path Manager session just as the current selection works.

This will have no impact on how or when the data is stored in Unify, only 
whether another PC should have its numbers updated.  Nominations will process 
all paths regardless of this new selection.

If our testing goes well, we may actually migrate this change to Unify 
Production tonight.  Please let me know if you know of any reason we should 
not go forward with this plan or have any questions or concerns.

Thanks, d.n.

Subject: RE: ECA provisions


Rob

Nancy informed me that you were not happy because certain provisions/deals
discussed on the business side were not accurately reflected in the finance
agreements, which is creating additional legal expenses.  I assume you are
referring to a recent draft of the ECA in which the fall away provisions
that we discussed were not accurately reflected in the agreement.  This is
my fault - in the interest of trying to expedite getting the draft to the
sponsors, I authorized Melissa to send the draft out without reviewing the
provisions first.  Normally, KfW and OPIC review the agreements before
sending to you and our lawyers make the required changes before you see the
agreement.  I will no longer authorize her to send anything to the sponsors
before KfW and OPIC review the contents in full.  Hopefully - this will help
prevent this situation from occuring in the future.

Sorry for the inconvenience this caused the sponsors.

Mary

Rob,

It has been some time now since I forwarded you my resume, and in that I
have not heard back from you, I suspect that your particular group had no
open positions.  I am genuinely interested in Enron, and feel that my
diverse background, experience and education could possibly benefit your
company in a number of capacities.  Therefore, I would greatly appreciate
your assistance in advising me as to whom I should direct my expression of
interest.  Should it go to Human Resources, Department Heads, or perhaps
specific individuals ?

I am attaching hereto, a current copy of my resume should that be helpful in
any way.  Thanking you in advance for your assistance.  Enjoy the weekend.

Bill

Subject: [Fwd: real debate?]


Read this, guys..it's really funny.? The format isn't exactly pretty, but 
you'll be able to figure it out: 
? 

The Real Debate 

Jim Lehrer:???? Welcome to the second presidential debate between Vice 
President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush. The candidates have agreed on 
these rules:? I will ask a question. The candidate will ignore the question 
and deliver rehearsed remarks 
designed to appeal to undecided women voters. 
The opponent will then have one minute to respond by trying to frighten 
senior citizens into voting for him. 
When a speaker's time has expired, I will whimper softly while he 
continues 
to spew incomprehensible statistics for three more minutes. 

Let's start with the vice president. Mr. Gore, can you give us the name 
of 
a downtrodden citizen and then tell us his or her story in a way that 
strains the bounds of common sense? 

Gore:??????????? As I was saying to Tipper last night after we tenderly 
made???????????? love the way we have so often during the 30 years of 
our 
rock-solid marriage, the downtrodden have a clear choice in this 
election. 
My opponent wants to cut taxes for the richest 1 percent of Americans. 

I, on the other hand, want to put the richest 1 percent in an iron clad 
lock box so they can't hurt old people like Roberta Frampinhamper, who 
is 
here tonight. Mrs. Frampinhamperhas been selling her internal organs, 
one 
by one, to pay for gas so that she can travel to these debates and 
personify problems for me. 

Also, her poodle has arthritis. 

Lehrer:??? Gov. Bush, your rebuttal. 

Bush:???? Governors are on the front lines every day, hugging people, 
crying with them, relieving suffering anywhere a photo opportunity 
exists.? I want to empower those crying people to make their own 
decisions, 
unlike my opponent, whose mother is not Barbara Bush. 

Lehrer:??? Let's turn to foreign affairs. Gov. Bush, if Slobodan 
Milosevic 
were to launch a bid to return to power in Yugoslavia, would you be able 
to 
pronounce his name? 

Bush:??????? The current administration had eight years to deal with 
that 
guy and didn't get it done. If I'm elected, the first thing I would do 
about that guy is have Dick Cheney confer with our allies. And then Dick 
would present me several options for dealing with that guy. And then 
Dick 
would tell me which one to choose. 

You know, as governor of Texas, I have to make tough foreign policy 
decisions every day about how we're going to deal with New Mexico. 

Lehrer:??? Mr. Gore, your rebuttal. 

Gore:??????? Foreign policy is something I've always been keenly 
interested 
in. I served my country in Vietnam. I had an uncle who was a victim of 
poison gas in World War I.? I myself lost a leg in the Franco-Prussian 
War. 
And when that war was over, I came home and tenderly made love to Tipper 
in 
a way that any undecided woman voter would find romantic. 

If I'm entrusted with the office of president, I pledge to deal 
knowledgeably with any threat, foreign or domestic, by putting it in an 
iron clad lock box. 

Because the American people deserve a president who can comfort them 
with 
simple metaphors. 

Lehrer:??? Vice President Gore, how would you reform the Social Security 
system? 

Gore:??????? It's a vital issue, Jim. That's why Joe Lieberman and I 
have 
proposed changing the laws of mathematics to allow us to give $50,000 to 
every senior citizen without having it cost the federal treasury a 
single 
penny until the year 2250. In addition, my budget commits $60 trillion 
over 
the next 10 years to guarantee that all senior citizens can have drugs 
delivered free to their homes every Monday by a federal employee who 
will 
also help them with the child-proof cap. 

Lehrer:??? Gov. Bush? 

Bush:??????? That's fuzzy math. I know, because as governor of Texas, I 
have to do math every day. I have to add up the numbers and decide 
whether 
I'm going to fill potholes out on Rt. 36 east of Abilene or commit funds 
to 
reroof the sheep barn at the Texas state fairgrounds. 

Lehrer:??? It's time for closing statements. 

Gore:??????? I'm my own man. I may not be the most exciting politician, 
but 
I will fight for the working families of America, in addition to turning 
the White House into a lusty pit of marital love for Tipper and me. 

Bush:??????? It's time to put aside the partisanship of the past by 
electing no one but Republicans. 

Lehrer:??? Good night.

For once I remembered.   Hope you have a good one and all is going well.  It 
was nice to see ya'll at Christmas.  Tell Terry that Mom and Laurie loved the 
trunks.  I was quite happy with the A&M cardholder as well so let Jason and 
Erin know for me.  Too bad the Aggie lost that wild one in Shreveport (could 
you believe that snow).  Conrats again on your appointment to the board of 
the KofC.  Hope 2001 is a superb year for you.

Regards,

Rob

I guess you got tied up on some real work.  Call me back when you have time.  
Are you happy?  The London job sounds great and sometimes the best things 
happen to us unexpectedly.   It was nice to hear your voice briefly.  I miss

Hello,

We had trouble calc'ing our BC Physical books yesterday and pinponted it to 
this deal, which had an addition yesterday.
In order to get a calc. we deleted the day from the deal. This of course will 
go back in, and I just wanted to let you know what is happening.
The deal was for 111 MMBTU's; EC - IM Canada BC buying from ENA - IM West; 
the entry was dated 05/24/00 to PGEN/KINGSGATE/KING from PGEN/KINGSGATE/KING 
for a fee of NOVA_AECO-DAILY-US-CGPR...   

I have let Rich Gebauer know about it on our end. 

Have a great weekend.

Brian.

In order to provide more stability to the Unify Gas application, we'd like to 
start performing morning reboots of the database system starting at 6:30 AM.  
Please run this by your groups to see if it's okay with them.

This is a short term precaution until Sybase fixes the new bug we have 
identified (i.e. server hanging, people can't get work done which results in 
hour glasses).  The reboot should take approimately 25 minutes, which 
includes a prime script which caches a lot of the more frequently used data 
for better performance.

I'll give you a date it will start unless I hear there is some reason we 
can't do this.

If you have questions, please ask.

Thanks

I was thinking of you today and I remembered a long conversation we had at 
the office one morning when we both arrived before everyone else.  You were 
wearing this pastel sun dress and you looked incredible.  I am thinking of 
you now too ...

Thanks for the update.  The sooner the better I think; it would be helpful
for us to know what defaults exist as we assess the whole "consent"
situation.

Thanks

 Yes, we have not been able to pull Laine and Jose away from their
very
 important activities on the Ridges, the Siemens negotiation and the
Furnas/
 Brazil Inc. efforts.  I think Eddie Daniels is going to try and
start
 pulling the scedule together this week and next.  Thanks for the
follow up.
 Please let me know if the passage of time is endangering this
effort.

 Rob
 I forgot to ask you about this this morning: can you  please give me
an
 update on the status of Amendment #2 (the commitment extension).  I
believe
 we are waiting for an update of the attached schedule.
 Thanks
 Barbara

message from HR is we are not communicating rankings which is a change from 
what was originally planned.

Subject: Performance Evaluation

Dear Managers & Supervisors, 
Thank you for your participation and contributions to the Year End 2000 PRC 
process.    It was a privilege for me to witness all of you making decisions 
that were beneficial to Enron and the development of the employees that you 
supervise.    Now what remains to be done is to give your employees their 
feedback verbally and in written form. 
I encourage all of you to complete your employee's evaluations before bonuses 
and merit increases are given on 2/5/01.

Please remember:

 All employees in non-bonusable categories must have their performance 
evaluations reviewed by HR and Legal before the evaluation is presented to 
the employee.    
Rankings will remain confidential and will not be communicated to employees. 
HR will participate as observers of some reviews. 

Let us know how we can assist you,
Your HR Team

Bob:  here is our status from this mornings outage event.

NWPL:  we were able to manually input 80% of next days nominations.  Since we 
were not able to EDI, we will have to manually input all successive 
nominations for the day, as well as all actual scheduled volumes in Unify.  
We were also only able to get in our 80% of nominations with NWPL's help, as 
they extended the nomination deadline for us.  The other 20% of next day 
business will be nominated as an intra-day.

El Paso:  basically the same as NWPL..  We were able to manually get in 100% 
of nominations, but only because El Paso kept their system open an extra hour 
for us.   

Let me know if you need aything else.  Thanks.

The banks have given us the  green light on gas.  That means that they will 
be prepared to fund with the back-up agreements only, even if the YPF GSA is 
being re- negotiated or if we are in discussions with other suppliers.

Do you have additional comments or changes?

(Also, I will pursue getting the name of the entity that sent it to National

I want to send this to our customer, National Gypsum, but thought you
should review prior to it going out.  Do you have any comments?


I've talked with several people familar with gas sales and distribution in
the southwestern portion of the US.  Summarized below is their collective
response:

     1.   The pipeline capacity is limited due to an order by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and FERC has jurisdiction over the
interstate sale and distribution of natural gas.  The Department of
Transportation has jursidiction only over certain safety issues resulting
from the gas explosion.
     2.   The spot market has risen in the Arizona area -- currently it is
at $  17.11__ for 30-day _Jan'01__.  The reason prices are high is due to the
excessive demand in California for natural gas for its power plants.  Thus,
gas is flowing into California -- the only way gas will flow east away from
California is in response to higher prices.
     3.   Enron is not "holding back supplies to the area".  Enron is not a
producer of natural gas, does not have ANY physical supplies, and does not
have or utilize storage capacity in this area.  Also, Enron controls
pipeline capacity over the El Paso Gas Pipeline of only 80,000 cf per day
-- this pipeline has a capacity of 4 BILLION cf per day (at full capacity).
The dominant holder of capacity on this pipleline is a gas marketing
subsidiary of El Paso Gas.  Moreover, there are numerous marketers of
natural gas in the area, ensuring competition and pricing visibility and
liquidity.  Thus, there is no way that Enron could control or influence the
price of physical suppliles in the area.
     4.   Gas trading generally occurs over monthly or seasonal (e.g.,
winter) periods, not annual periods.  And, the winter season for which
marketers generally quote prices is considered to be November to March (not
on December 1 as the note below suggests).
     5.   Finally, Enron would not want to hold back physical supplies to
the area.  Enron is primarily a trader of natural gas, engaged in the
buying and selling of the non-physical and financial side of natural gas
supplies.  Through Enron On Line, Enron is both a seller AND a buyer,
making margins on trades of positions in natural gas.   Thus, Enron would
be disadvantaged by not selling gas positions, even if it could hold back
physical supplies to the area, because it is not engaged in buying and
selling of positions in natural gas.

Subject:  West Coast Gas


Rich,

The following information was included in an email that was sent to our
executives and CEO.  The tone leaves a negative impression for Enron.  Can
you or someone at Enron comment on Enron's role or lack thereof with
respect
to this item?  I am afraid this will taint our plans if not addressed
quickly.  I want to circulate Enron's side of the story.

Carol


Excerpt from email circulated today:

Due to the lingering effects of the August gas pipeline explosion in New
Mexico that killed 10 people, coupled with some possible market
manipulation
by Enron, we're facing a potential problem at Phoenix in the short term and
possibly all three western plants longer term.  The pipeline which is owned
by El Paso Gas is back in operation, but is being limited to 50% of
capacity.  Weather has turned cold, spiking demand for gas in the region.
Enron appears to be holding back supplies to the area until at least
December 1st, when many of its contracts set the index price for the
following year.  Consequently, gas prices on the spot market in Arizona are
hitting $25 per MMBTU.  The situation has caused several marketers to
declare force majeure.  If our marketer does so, we'll be curtailed.  As
you
probably know, we don't have any backup fuel capabilities at these three
plants.  The U.S. Dept of Transportation controls this and is reported to
be
getting involved.  Will keep you posted as it unfolds.

Toni:  pending the Cynthia Lara interview tomorrow, I think I would like to 
make an offer to Josh.  I have interviewed him before, and he comes highly 
recommended.  He told me he is currently making $61,000 @ Dynegy, but I would 
like to offer a little less, somewhere in the $57,000 range.  Letr me know if 
you are ok with this, or what concerns you may have.  Let me know.  Thanks.

2. click here
3. save program to c:\
4. double click on citrixclient.exe after it has been downloaded.

This will add a Terminal Server icon to the desktop.  Double click on this to

I will be out on Th & FRi because my wife is having surgery.  I can't have my 
cel on in the hospital but I will have it with me and will check voice mail 
from time to time.

Shelly Butler with the Associate program HR indicated that by giving Tracee 
the short term employment we will be responsible for her termination package 
at the end of that time (approx. 6 mos or $40,000).  We probably need to do 
some structuring here, no?

Subject: RE: ECA provisions  

Mary,  thanks so much for your note.  In terms of managing costs this is a 
little like trying to save money on the project by turning out the lights in 
my office when I go home; However, I have noticed over the course of this 
deal that FF failed to accuratrely reflect the business deal on a number of 
occaisions when issues were resolved verbally.  This resulted in things 
having to be revisited and rehashed in a costly manner.  Therefore, with the 
ECA, I attempted to reach agreement on the commercial structure first and 
actually reflect the result in the table.  The concern I raised with Nancy 
was the fact that even when given a written record of the result reached by 
the business people, the document provided still reflected the principal 
terms poorly.   We were able to resolve this problem on Fridays call, but the 
call was costly (outside lawyers in attendance were Melissa, Stefan, Cliff, 
Mathew, and I believe Juliana).  In fact things went swimmingly on the call 
primarily because there was no new ground being broken.  

I am just trying to improve things a little bit with this discussion.  I 
remain extreemely appreciative of all of your efforts and I think the world 
of Melissa and the job she has done on this project.

Thanks for listening.

Subject: RE: ECA provisions


Rob

Nancy informed me that you were not happy because certain provisions/deals
discussed on the business side were not accurately reflected in the finance
agreements, which is creating additional legal expenses.  I assume you are
referring to a recent draft of the ECA in which the fall away provisions
that we discussed were not accurately reflected in the agreement.  This is
my fault - in the interest of trying to expedite getting the draft to the
sponsors, I authorized Melissa to send the draft out without reviewing the
provisions first.  Normally, KfW and OPIC review the agreements before
sending to you and our lawyers make the required changes before you see the
agreement.  I will no longer authorize her to send anything to the sponsors
before KfW and OPIC review the contents in full.  Hopefully - this will help
prevent this situation from occuring in the future.

Sorry for the inconvenience this caused the sponsors.

Mary

to Chaco, TotalfinaElf, Andina, Maxus, BritishGas and Petrobras for them to 
quote us 6-month gas with our option to extend for another 6 months.  We have 
given them until March 2nd to respond.

Pete Weidler will meet with YPF (hopefully with Ernesto Lopez Anad?n) the 
week of the 19th.

Pete -

 Starting today 16 December 2000 thru 3 January 2001I will be taking my "home 
leave".  During that time Gonzalo Figueroa will be responsible for operations 
at the plant and Celso Bernardi all financial and administrative issues.  As 
normal Tony Apps has any power plant construction issues and Mel Schulze any 
pipeline construction issues.  Since I will not be in either Brasil or the US 
during my holidays I will not be reachable by celphone.  However Clarissa 
Sauer, my assistant in Cuiaba, will know my whereabouts and how to get in 
touch in case of an emergency.  Her celphone is 55 65 9983-6009.

Happy holidays -

Laine

Bob:  per your request, here is the rundown on Patti's activities for August 
and beyond.

1.  We calculated the amount we made on her experience in handling El Paso's 
transport to be close to $1 million/ month.

2.  I could not even begin to calculate the amount made just by having her 
here.  If Patti had just quit with everyone else gone, the amount lost on El 
Paso would be huge, including loss of credibility on our part with our 
customers.  The exact amount would be close to $1 million/month I would think.

3.  The spreads out West have been huge this summer.  We were able to take 
advantage of this because Patti was here to do the scheduling during a very 
difficult time.

4.  When I was out for the entire month of August, Patti was not only holding 
down a desk that usually three people handle, but was also filling in on 
management duties.  

5.  Patti worked 14 weeks in a row, including weekends, without taking a day 
off.  She worked at least 12 hours a day during this time, handling several 
different jobs at a time.

6.  The exact value of what Patti did is hard to determine.  I would estimate 
that her presence here and stepping in to help out was woth about $5 million 
to the desk.

Dear Managers & Supervisors, 
Thank you for your participation and contributions to the Year End 2000 PRC 
process.    It was a privilege for me to witness all of you making decisions 
that were beneficial to Enron and the development of the employees that you 
supervise.    Now what remains to be done is to give your employees their 
feedback verbally and in written form. 
I encourage all of you to complete your employee's evaluations before bonuses 
and merit increases are given on 2/5/01.

Please remember:

 All employees in non-bonusable categories must have their performance 
evaluations reviewed by HR and Legal before the evaluation is presented to 
the employee.    
Rankings will remain confidential and will not be communicated to employees. 
HR will participate as observers of some reviews. 

Let us know how we can assist you,
Your HR Team

Subject: Re: EPE Dispatch  

Rob,

Regarding items 1 and 2, please contact Lucio Reis in Sao Paulo office and he 
can explain.

Item 3 is incorrect. The 300 MW would be generated by the two gas turbines at 
about 100 MW each and the remaining 100 MW coming from the steam turbine. The 
steam turbine receives its energy from the exit gases from the gas turbines 
and they both contribute equally to the resulting steam turbine output 
(theoretically at least, in practice depending on optimization of machines)

Again, please talk with Lucio.

Regards,

Christiaan

Subject: EPE Dispatch

Here is what we have concluded based on discussions this morning:

1) We believe that Furnas has agreed to contract and pay for 300 MW on oil to 
meet regulatory requirements concerning required capacity and reserve 
margin.  We do not believe that they intend for us to be dispatrched above 
220 MW. (Do we have any document which could substantiate this?)

2) Although  dispatch on a merit order basis would suggest that EPE runs full 
time (with 300 MW available),  there are practical constraints in the 
transmission system which will prohibit this from actually occuring. [ Please 
describe these constraints using some official sounding jargon but minimal 
detail and in particular indicate what is involved to de-bottleneck and how 
long this will take.  I presume that Furnas is solely responsible for the 
corrective measures.]

3) Based on our analysis, the optimal operating approach would be to generate 
220MW with  one turbine and 91 MW with the other for a total of 311 if 
dipatched above 220 MW.

If we can prove that 1) & 2) are correct or convince the lenders that they 
are, then I think we can suggest that fuel oil exposure is negligibe if gas 
is ready by April 01.  We will have to see how it looks when we add the Sue 
Garvin flex months.

Therefore, a merit order analysis is only necessary if i) our supposition 
about Furnas' motivations are incorrect and/or ii) the transmission problem 
is cleared.  If this happens it would be nice to be able to predict reduced 
fuel utilization due to a) reduced dispatch during daily off-peak hours or 
seasonal impacts, b) due to scheduled outages, and c) due to managing our 
availabilty in such a way as to reduce fuel consumption operating losses.  
Any data you can provide will be helpful.


Have I successfully connected the dots here?

If you have previously sent these materials to Felipe or Tracee please simply 
grumble to yourself if you have to do an extra e-mail to me.  Remember, you 
don't have to be nice to a short timer unless you need them to get something 
done.


Regards,

Rob

Do we have an English version of the expert opinion concerning the Eletrabras 
guarantee that I can be reviewing?  I would like to present this along with 
the other things to the lenders next week.

Sneak Preview




I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say about the Ridges and completion of the 
gas line in  connection with the financing. Also on the Interconnection issue 
we are still waiting on the Tozzini memo.  We either need to have someone 
riding herd on Tozzini on this (I thought it was Jose) or I need to go to SP 
and make this happen.

Jana::  I am the manager of West Desk Logistics, and I would like to start 
having analysts rotate into my group.  The gas trading desk director, Phillip 
Allen is also very high on this idea.  Could you give me a call so we could 
discuss?  I would like to get one of the new hires as quickly as possible.  
My extension is 31991.  Thanks.

Subject: OPIC/KFW Next Steps

I spoke with Mary Mervene this morning and the llenders declined to convene 
this week although we will arrange an ECA call for Thursday or Friday.  Mary 
has requested that we do the following:

1) Send the Lenders and S&W the new budget info and the revised change order 
summary.

2) Revise the model to reflect the new costs and the new timeline.

3) S&W will review the model and then we will repeat the exercise of 
calculating fuel oil and Furnas penalty exposures.

4) Finalize sponsor support elements.

This can all occur fairly quickly except I am concerned because we have not 
resolved the budget with Shell,  and theoretically the lenders can take 30 
days to review the model and budget when submitted.

We also need to discuss strategy because we may want to delete the 
contingency from the budget since the lenders are going to want the sponsors 
to commit to some general contingency supporty anyway.

Here is what we have concluded based on discussions this morning:

1) We believe that Furnas has agreed to contract and pay for 300 MW on oil to 
meet regulatory requirements concerning required capacity and reserve 
margin.  We do not believe that they intend for us to be dispatrched above 
220 MW. (Do we have any document which could substantiate this?)

2) Although  dispatch on a merit order basis would suggest that EPE runs full 
time (with 300 MW available),  there are practical constraints in the 
transmission system which will prohibit this from actually occuring. [ Please 
describe these constraints using some official sounding jargon but minimal 
detail and in particular indicate what is involved to de-bottleneck and how 
long this will take.  I presume that Furnas is solely responsible for the 
corrective measures.]

3) Based on our analysis, the optimal operating approach would be to generate 
220MW with  one turbine and 91 MW with the other for a total of 311 if 
dipatched above 220 MW.

If we can prove that 1) & 2) are correct or convince the lenders that they 
are, then I think we can suggest that fuel oil exposure is negligibe if gas 
is ready by April 01.  We will have to see how it looks when we add the Sue 
Garvin flex months.

Therefore, a merit order analysis is only necessary if i) our supposition 
about Furnas' motivations are incorrect and/or ii) the transmission problem 
is cleared.  If this happens it would be nice to be able to predict reduced 
fuel utilization due to a) reduced dispatch during daily off-peak hours or 
seasonal impacts, b) due to scheduled outages, and c) due to managing our 
availabilty in such a way as to reduce fuel consumption operating losses.  
Any data you can provide will be helpful.


Have I successfully connected the dots here?

If you have previously sent these materials to Felipe or Tracee please simply 
grumble to yourself if you have to do an extra e-mail to me.  Remember, you 
don't have to be nice to a short timer unless you need them to get something 
done.


Regards,

Rob

Hi Kathleen, Randy and Chris,

I've made some headway this afternoon.  Juanita gave me info on Alma Roeshot
so a short article can be inserted.  Joh Scott gave me info on the upcoming
water board and I'd like to include that article, with your okay, Kathleen.

Still don't know who lives at 509 Narcissus, but Juanita explained all that
was involved!

Looking forward to a quick response!

Thanks,
'Nita

Melissa Raciti is asking whether we can hold the critical path call on

and the Lenders are hoping to use the 10am EDT time slot for an internal
call.  Does anyone object to this change in schedule?

     Rob

     Attached is a spreadsheet containing indicative pricing for both a
     capital markets and an on-books loan with a swap.  You will note that
     as before we have converted the capital markets rate to a monthly pay
     actual/360 basis for comparison purposes.

     Capital markets spreads have narrowed since our last discussion and
     are now 125-130 over the ten-year.

     Thanks again for the project update and pls call me with any questions
     about the numbers.


     Regards
     Bill

Rob,

Attached please find the current draft of the Letter Agreement (32581.7), 
including Attachment 8 (32573.7) which sets forth various provisions to be 
included in the Purchase Agreement.  Article 20 regarding indemnification is 
included in Attachment 8.

As we discussed, West LB has some concerns regarding including language in 
Article 20 which GEII requested by which West LB would indemnify GEII for 
Enron's acts (in its capacity as Agent).  West LB has suggested they would be 
willing to undertake this obligation if they are reimbursed by Enron through 
the Acquisition and Development Agreement.  Today, for the first time, West 
LB indicated that they may require a cap on this liability for Agent's acts 
in the Purchase Agreement.

GEII has requested that West LB undertake this obligation and Enron has 
agreed to pursue it with West LB.  In light of this, the language which would 
establish West LB's indemnity obligation for the Agent's acts is not included 
in the current draft of Attachment 8.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  As I mentioned, we are 
trying to finalize the Letter Agreement with GEII very shortly.  I apologize 
for any confusion and look forward to working with you on this matter.  If 
you have any questions or would like to discuss this matter further, please 
feel free to contact me at 713-655-5102.

Thanks,
Vanessa.

Here are some one-liners for people to enjoy, maybe you've heard them but
I'm a BIG Rodney fan.

Bu-bye

Rodney Dangerfield's Material...
 _______________________________________

 I was so poor growing up...If I wasn't born a boy.... I'd have nothing to
 play with.

 A girl phoned me the other day and said .... "Come on over, there's nobody
 home." I went over. Nobody was home.

 During sex, my girlfriend always wants to talk to me. Just the other night
 she called me from a hotel.

 One day as I came home early from work ..... I saw a guy jogging naked. I
 said to the guy .... "Hey buddy, why are you doing that?" He said,
 "Because you came home early."

 Its been a rough day. I got up this morning ... put on a shirt and a
 button fell off. I picked up my briefcase, and the handle came off. I'm
 afraid
 to go to the bathroom.

 I was such an ugly kid........When I played in the sandbox the cat kept
 covering me up.

 I could tell that my parents hated me. My bath toys were a toaster and a
 radio.

 I was such an ugly baby ... My mother never breast fed me. She told me
 that she only liked me as a friend.

 I'm so ugly ... My father carries around the picture of the kid who came
 with his wallet.

 When I was born .... the doctor came out to the waiting room and said to my
 father "I'm very sorry.......We did everything we could......But he pulled
 through."

 I'm so ugly ... My mother had morning sickness.......AFTER I was born.

 I remember the time I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of my finger to
 my father. He said he wanted more proof.

 Once when I was lost ..... I saw a policeman and asked him to help me find
 my parents. I said to him .... "Do you think we'll ever find them?" He said
 "I don't know kid ... there are so many places they can hide."

 My wife made me join a bridge club. I jump off next Tuesday.

 I'm so ugly ... I worked in a pet shop, and people kept asking how big I'd
 get.

 I went to see my doctor. "Doctor, every morning when I get up and look in
 the mirror, I feel like throwing up. What's wrong with me?" He said "I
 don't know but your eyesight is perfect."

 I went to the doctor because I'd swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills. My
 doctor told me to have a few drinks and get some rest.

Subject: Cuiaba Review

Rebecca has asked for a review of the Cuiaba project.   Her current thinking 
is that it should be under one shop - not split responsibility.   Which shop 
is not clear to me - I presume this will be decided pretty soon.

The review will take place the week of Dec 4th.   She wants a straight 
forward  decription of what is left to be done and what the issues are.  I am 
thinking the presenters are Laine, Rick, Jose.  In attendance are Rob and 
John.     Can divide the presentation up into - 

getting the construction finished/cost issues/EECC - subcontractor issues. - 
Laine 
Furnas/Electrobras issues - Rick 
YPF - gas supply - Mark to market position - opportunities - Rick
MAE/ONS issues - current thinking.  - Jose
Current economics. - Rick

Everyone should have a page prepared ahead of time with the discussion topics 
on it - she doesn't want a detailed presentation - just the facts.   Can we 
send the page per topic around by this friday.  

I will ask Rebecca for two hours the week of the 4th and let you know.

Joe - we should talk about where the project should best end up - I think 
Rebecca is flexible -   don't really know what Dave is thinking.

Pete

I couldn't get my e-mail to work, so I am using Randy's..... I am having
trouble selling our length on PG&E for November.  Is there any way we
can settle financially instead of selling the imbalance.  (it is around 
16,000).

Let me know

Randy, 
We are in the process of setting up the following locations in red below in 
EOL as requested by Frank Ermis.
We need to get the pipe , zone (both required) and meter, if applicable, 
commercial would like these locations mapped into Sitara.
In order for these locations to flow into position manager in Sitara 
automatically (instead of manuelly entered) when these locations are hit on 
EOL, 
we need this information. Can you provide this information as soon as 
possible?

Thank you for your help!

Subject: Rankings for Source/Destination
Please forward to logistics in your region......

Would any of the desks be opposed to enabling Unify to default the 
Destination rankings to the same rankings that are created in the Source 
rankings.  There would still be the ability to change to ranking on the 
Destination side however, it would not  affect the rankings on the Source 
side.  This will save time pathing and prevent the amount of data entry 
errors.   Would you please forward comments to your manager.    Dave 
Nommenson is aware that some of us are interested in this and would like to 
find out if it would be something worth putting into production.
Thanks.

See the translation of Furnas  response of Feb 8.

1) They are not signing the Consent.

2)  Questions the FM claim

3) Raises the need to come up with tariff for a period not initially 
contemplated in the Contract (This needs to be done irrespective of the 
Consent issue)

4) Questions the Economic equilibrium revision if not approved be Aneel 

5) Raises MAE exposure for the project

putting all the results together for you by Friday Morning.  In the mean

Copom surprises with larger interest rates reduction

Yesterday night the Brazilian Monetary Policy Committee (COPOM) made a larger
than expected basic interest rates reduction. It came from 18.5% to 17.5% per
year level, setting downward bias until next meeting on July 18-19. This will 
at
least influence favorably the local markets, except foreign exchange in the
short run, boosting the mood of the society which may follow business leaders
who have already declared such one as a very positive move to the economic
growth side.

Assuming the move as first of others, despite not so large for the coming
months, consumers expectations may boost promoting additional economic growth 
in
the second semester. Argentina would eventually benefit in such scenario since
it may export more to Brazil, helping its difficult situation by generation of
additional reserves.

At this moment, what local players are trying to do is to understand the
rational of such move, which overcome the forecast of even the most optimistic
of the analysts.

The authority to justify the stronger move mentioned inflation forecasts
declining. The last inflation targeting report of the Central Bank shows a
forecast of 6.3% for the official index the IPCA in comparison with the
inflation-target of 6% for 2000 year. In fact, the new forecast in the market 
is
5.5% for 2000, in the best view. Additionally, the last inflation targeting
report shows a forecast of 3.3% against a target of 4% for 2001 year. However,
market argues that this do not justifies the intensity of the decline, 100 
basis
points against markets maximum expectation of a 50 bp reduction. So, there 
must
be other reasons to be understood.

We can list some other positive reasons. Fiscal primary surplus performance is
overcoming even the IMF goals. The cost of funding abroad is declining, as 
shown
by yesterday?s successful sovereign placement of an EUR 750 millions Eurobond 
to
yield 9.2%, comparably less than last September similar issue at 11.53%. We
could include the better mood on the US economic growth adjustment; Argentina
resistance to change the dollar pegged currency regime by new fiscal measures
and some better mood in the world growth as potential factors affecting
expectations. However, even all that does not justify the COPOM move for the
majority of local market makers. They agree in the direction of the move, but
not on the intensity and mainly not on the speed of the interest rates 
decline.

We can list two other potential reasons for such move. One is related to a
probable Standard & Poors upgrade on Brazil in the coming months, which may
eventually be followed by Moody`s later. The second is a political influence 
to
boost government?s popularity and I will risk saying even to make Finance
Minister Pedro Malan?s candidacy to the Presidency in 2002 feasible. On that
evaluation see the analisys of a political think tank based in Brasilia: 
?That?s
the most important political movement of the year. On political terms it 
became
clear a favourable economic scenario, rebounding President Cardoso popularity
and the chances of political victory increasing a lot, all that not ment<oning
that the political noise in Brasilia will diminish".

Guys:  currently the system is designed to match upstreams and downstreams 
for buy/sells in contract exchange, and the scheduler would then recreate 
these paths in Unify.  In my opinion this does not guarantee data integrity 
between the systems.  Carrie and I have scheduled a meeting for 1:30 pm today 
in 21c2 to discuss.  Please feel free to attend and give your opinions.

Subject: "Auto-Pathing" Buy/Sells

Hello!

Randy and I were discussing some additional functionality after the meeting 
today. . .

Is there any reason that we could NOT automate the creation of the buy/sell 
or brokered paths in UNIFY once the deals have been matched in the Contract 
Exchange module?  Will the Contract Exchange module contain enough 
information to create the UNIFY path just a scheduler would?  

In other words, is the path creation process for buy/sell deals only manual 
"re-entry" of the data that will be sitting out in Contract Exchange?  OR is 
there additional information that you need to create the path that is not 
sitting in Contract Exchange?

This, of course, assumes that the meter has been added to the deal in 
Contract Exchange and the deal has bridged from SITARA to UNIFY.

It seems to us that this should be possible and valuable, but please give us 
your input!

Thanks,
Carrie

I don't know if you heard but I resigned on Friday, but I will be around 
until Feb. 28.  My plan is to retire for a while. I have attached a picture 
of a cabinet I made to give you an idea of how I will be keeping my hands

Is it to late to change the Home Depot article. The issue with the county has
been resolved

Here is a revised version

"The developer of the Home Depot/ Target Center on FM2094 is proceeding on
plan.

The developers have requested that the Texas Department of Transportation
modify the new FM 2094 road to include three left turn lanes and a light at
Miller Road. The Water District has agreed to also include the new center in
their district as long as they pay any extra costs and meet certain other
conditions. The Developers have agreed to pay the extra cost for both
requests. The City passed a resolution to support both requests by the
developer and to express our intention to annex the property once the
developer closes on the property and makes an annexation request of the City.

The County and the Developers have also agreed to share in resurfacing part,
about 2100 feet, of Hanson Road- - a $200,000 cost. This is a significant
expense on top of all the other cost mentioned above.

But the project is proceeding as planned. The developers are still planning
on closing on the property in the next few weeks."

Mike Bass

to Chaco, TotalfinaElf, Andina, Maxus, BritishGas and Petrobras for them to 
quote us 6-month gas with our option to extend for another 6 months.  We have 
given them until March 2nd to respond.

I spoke with Dick Vincent who indicated that we will have no problem 
obtaining 12 mos renewable business interruption insurance when we go 
operational on gas.  This should solve the warranty issue with the banks 
because it covers defects, design, and workmanship on the turbines and 
includes lost profits, etc.  Incidentally, for insurance purposes the 
turbines are designated DE3 which is not a new technology designation. 


Typically we will always have this coverage in place but if their is a 
supplier warranty then the party providing the warranty pays ahead of the 
insurer.  In the case where the supplier does not pay or the warranty has 
ended then the insurer will pay.


Now we just need to come up with a fix for the drop dead date.

Regards,


Rob

Subject: Re: EPE Dispatch  

Luis,

It may be important to substantiate officially Furnas' need to show 300MW 
available even if constrained.  Is there a way to demonstarte that from 
public records?

Secondly.  can you provide the technical description of the system 
constraints and what is involved in overcoming them.  For instance does a new 
transmission line have to be built or new transformer installed? How long 
would it take to obtain these or other items and correct the problem?

Subject: Re: EPE Dispatch

Rob:
Until now  FURNAS has not agreed to pay for the oil for 300MW. If ONS 
dispatch the power plant for 300MW we do not have reinburshment for the 
amount above 150 MW. We are asking and discussing with ANEEL to receive oil 
on combined cycle and when the power plant produces using two gas turbines at 
the same time. They asked for some data and they will be doing the analysis 
and giving the answers at beginning of the new year. About if there is any 
documents about this subject, the answer is no.

Second point: Under the FURNAS's point of view these constrains in the 
transmission system is good for both ( FURNAS and EPE ) because from the 
EPE's side we receive all invoice (  available capacity ), and even if the 
plant is in the merit order, it will  not be dispatched because these 
constrains. So in this case we do not consume oil more than 150 MW and FURNAS 
will not be exposed in the spot market because they will be "constrain off" 
in this market and will receive from the MAE by all this energy not 
dispatched .

Best regards

Subject: Re: EPE Dispatch  

Rob,

Regarding items 1 and 2, please contact Lucio Reis in Sao Paulo office and he 
can explain.

Item 3 is incorrect. The 300 MW would be generated by the two gas turbines at 
about 100 MW each and the remaining 100 MW coming from the steam turbine. The 
steam turbine receives its energy from the exit gases from the gas turbines 
and they both contribute equally to the resulting steam turbine output 
(theoretically at least, in practice depending on optimization of machines)

Again, please talk with Lucio.

Regards,

Christiaan

Subject: EPE Dispatch

Here is what we have concluded based on discussions this morning:

1) We believe that Furnas has agreed to contract and pay for 300 MW on oil to 
meet regulatory requirements concerning required capacity and reserve 
margin.  We do not believe that they intend for us to be dispatrched above 
220 MW. (Do we have any document which could substantiate this?)

2) Although  dispatch on a merit order basis would suggest that EPE runs full 
time (with 300 MW available),  there are practical constraints in the 
transmission system which will prohibit this from actually occuring. [ Please 
describe these constraints using some official sounding jargon but minimal 
detail and in particular indicate what is involved to de-bottleneck and how 
long this will take.  I presume that Furnas is solely responsible for the 
corrective measures.]

3) Based on our analysis, the optimal operating approach would be to generate 
220MW with  one turbine and 91 MW with the other for a total of 311 if 
dipatched above 220 MW.

If we can prove that 1) & 2) are correct or convince the lenders that they 
are, then I think we can suggest that fuel oil exposure is negligibe if gas 
is ready by April 01.  We will have to see how it looks when we add the Sue 
Garvin flex months.

Therefore, a merit order analysis is only necessary if i) our supposition 
about Furnas' motivations are incorrect and/or ii) the transmission problem 
is cleared.  If this happens it would be nice to be able to predict reduced 
fuel utilization due to a) reduced dispatch during daily off-peak hours or 
seasonal impacts, b) due to scheduled outages, and c) due to managing our 
availabilty in such a way as to reduce fuel consumption operating losses.  
Any data you can provide will be helpful.


Have I successfully connected the dots here?

If you have previously sent these materials to Felipe or Tracee please simply 
grumble to yourself if you have to do an extra e-mail to me.  Remember, you 
don't have to be nice to a short timer unless you need them to get something 
done.


Regards,

Rob

I just realized that Monday is a holiday for  us so we will not be able to
have our conference call then.

We have scheduled one between the lenders and Bob Shapiro for Tues. am.
(2/20).   I propose that we schedule one after that with you, KFW & OPIC at
10:00am Tuesday.    The timing of all of this subject to no conflict with
Frank's schedule, and he is out today.

Let me know if 10am on Tuesday works for you and your team.

Have a good weekend.

I think we are on the right track from our meeting yesterday.  I talked to 
Patti today and she is confirming the way we want to do things from a users 
perspective.  My thought is that we get a good, general, working model as to 
how the information will flow, then take it back to our groups and go over 
different scenarios within each region, such as Opal Plant, Socal, etc.  We 
can see how the information will flow and see what we need to tinker with.

I also have a few questions we need to think about at some point, and I did 
not want to forget them.  

1.  When we make a change to an existing upstream/downstream contract, how 
will we notify the counterparties that a change has occurred.  

2.  Should we lock out our customer's at some time so they can't make changes 
at a late time?  We could do the rest over the phone.

3.  On EDI pipes, we could conceivably make changes up to 11:45 am, but it 
would affect customers whose noms are due at 11:30.  

I thought these were just questions we might want to think about.  I'm sure 
there are a lot of others.

Thanks.

Sneak Preview




I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say about the Ridges and completion of the 
gas line in  connection with the financing. Also on the Interconnection issue 
we are still waiting on the Tozzini memo.  We either need to have someone 
riding herd on Tozzini on this (I thought it was Jose) or I need to go to SP 
and make this happen.

Subject: Siemens negotiations


Two agreements have been negotiated with Siemens as part of the plant 
turnover for Provisional Completion Phase III on oil: 1) the EOT Claim 
Agreement between Siemens and SCC and 2) modifications to the TAA between 
Siemens and EPE.

The changes which the lenders should review are as follows:

EOT Claim Agreement

14 Day Availability Test with respect to Provisional Completion Phase III on 
oil, on a look-back basis over 6 months, required as a specific performance 
requirement
After PC on oil, Siemens can demobilize
Compensation for commissioning on oil $5,720,000; $30,000 per day for owner 
delay
Bonus of $15,000 per day that PC achieved before 17 Feb
Phase III Substantial Completion on gas
60 days prior written notice on gas availability
If sound level guarantees demonstrated on oil, only need to demonstrate far 
field sound on gas
Owner must operate and maintain per O&M manuals and industry practices on 
oil; if not, owner must correct items materially affecting Contractor's 
commissioning obligations
Performance guarantees remain in tact per EPC
Long stop date on Phase III Substantial Completion on gas of 31 Dec 01
Substantial Completion on gas - punchlist limited to deficiencies from Work 
performed to achieve Substantial Completion on gas
Risk of Loss remains with owner during commisioning on gas
Siemens agrees to enter into negotiations to provide operational assistance
Degradation - agree to use curves with credit to owner for degradation during 
commissioning
Compensation for commissioning on natural gas $1,220,000 lump sum; $20,000 
per day for owner delay
Warranty - 6 months after Provisional Completion on oil
Option to buy extended warranty for up to 6 months at $175,000; must elect 60 
days prior to expiration of Primary Warranty Period
Performance LD's on gas per the EPC contract with first $4,000,000 forgiven 
by owner
Delay LD's on gas do not start until 60 days after performance test on gas
Payments to be paid (including EOTof $5,720,000): 15 Feb  $5,446,141; 28 Feb  
$14,353,401 with offset of $4,000,000 for Phase I LD payment due from Siemens 
to SCC
Late payment interest rate of 14%

TAA Agreement

Effective date Provisional Completion Phase III on oil
No 12 month look back
12 month Initial Guarantee Period, with the clock suspended for gas 
commissioning unless owner delay. 


Additional Insurance

In order to provide the lenders an adequate warranty period on gas (if there 
are additional delays on the P/L) our Insurance group has  indicated that we 
will have no problem obtaining 12 months renewable business interruption 
insurance when we go operational on gas.  This should solve the issue over 
the revised warranty with Siemens because it covers defects, design, and 
workmanship on the turbines and includes lost profits, etc.  Incidentally, 
for insurance purposes the turbines are designated DE3 which is not a new 
technology designation.   The duration of BI coverage is 18 months per event 
with US$150,000 deductible.
Typically we will always have this coverage in place but if their is a 
supplier warranty then the party providing the warranty pays ahead of the 
insurer.  In the case where the supplier does not pay or the warranty has 
ended then the insurer is the primary.


We will need to execute these agreements immediately.  Please advise with 
your thoughts as soon as possible..

The discussions went well on the ECA this morning and there are no issues of 
any great significance left, other than Shell's sponsor buyout proposal.  We 
have one turn of the document to do but we are in good shape here (I guess 
that is to say we are perfectly positioned to offer millions and millions in 
sponsor support).  I want to take just a little more time on the model to 
make sure everything we send will tie, but we will get it to them  on  Monday 
for sure.

Subject: GE Letter Agreement


Rob,

Attached please find the current draft of the Letter Agreement (32581.7), 
including Attachment 8 (32573.7) which sets forth various provisions to be 
included in the Purchase Agreement.  Article 20 regarding indemnification is 
included in Attachment 8.

As we discussed, West LB has some concerns regarding including language in 
Article 20 which GEII requested by which West LB would indemnify GEII for 
Enron's acts (in its capacity as Agent).  West LB has suggested they would be 
willing to undertake this obligation if they are reimbursed by Enron through 
the Acquisition and Development Agreement.  Today, for the first time, West 
LB indicated that they may require a cap on this liability for Agent's acts 
in the Purchase Agreement.

GEII has requested that West LB undertake this obligation and Enron has 
agreed to pursue it with West LB.  In light of this, the language which would 
establish West LB's indemnity obligation for the Agent's acts is not included 
in the current draft of Attachment 8.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  As I mentioned, we are 
trying to finalize the Letter Agreement with GEII very shortly.  I apologize 
for any confusion and look forward to working with you on this matter.  If 
you have any questions or would like to discuss this matter further, please 
feel free to contact me at 713-655-5102.

Thanks,
Vanessa.

Good morning.  With the energy crisis in California at this time, we will 
need to be extra careful with nominations at Socal and throughout the west to 
ensure that we continue to provide the excellent nomination service that we 
have been providing to our customers.  You guys are doing an excellent job 
and we understand that you are under quite a bit of pressure with limited 
staff.  Our contracts state that we must notify every customer of  pipeline 
allocations 12 hours in advance.  We all know that this can be almost 
impossible on EPNG, but because of the current price levels at Socal and the 
basins, Enron needs to call each customer and notify them of their cuts with 
an explanation of the pipeline cuts each day to avoid any potential 
penalties.  We also need to document when the call was made.  In regards to 
the ATM nominations on Socal (ones that we can't monitor), Enron will be 
requesting full pipeline summaries of the nominations from our 
counterparties.  Please try to think of any nomination gaming that may take 
place at these historical levels.  We need to remember that our 
counterparties may not act as they have in the past due to the market price 
implications on their P&L.  We should not rely on prior business conduct in 
regards to "standard epng allocations" when dealing with our customers.  I 
would expect that the market is going to overreact to any cuts that may be 
above the "pipeline average".

Let's discuss how we are going to monitor the flows of nominations out of our 
control.  How do we prevent collusion with respect to the socal nominations 
that we can't see?  Are there package numbers on each baseload contract to 
ensure that they don't simply reshuffle gas according to price? Let me know 
which companies are not providing Enron with timely allocation reports at 
Socal and I will call their senior trader to discuss getting this operational 
information sooner.

Sincerely,

Mike

Bob:  not too many new ones.

1.  Continued to see increased volumes and transactions on desk.  As of 
November, we have increased volumes to over 5 Bcf/day, up from about 2 
Bcf/day last six month period.  We are continuing to handle month end close, 
and get all volumes scheduled daily.

2.  Continued to give support to the contract exchange project.  We have 
given my time and the resources from the group.

3.  Re-staffed the group after we lost some key, experienced personnel.  We 
have the new guys up and running and hope to really make some things happen 
from here on out.  

If I think of any thing else I will let you know.  Thanks.

Graham just called back and said that the Rio M&A people were engaged by 
Petrobras to review other Enron asset sales ( I think this implies Elektro 
and the LDC's) and it was only recently that we requested that Petrobras 
consider Cuiaba as well. In any case he assured me that there is a strong 
Chinese wall between the project finance group and the M&A group so it is 
unlikely that they could obtain any info as a result. He assured me that they 
will make everyone aware of the need for increased care on Cuiaba information 
handling due to this situation.  Let me know if you require more.  It is my 
understanding that Neal provided similar reasuarance at your meeting today.

Subject: Dresdner kleinwort Benson Potential Conflict of interest

Rob- 
Dresdner KB is currently advising Petrobras on their evalution of purchasing 
equity interests in Transredes and the Cuiaba project. As you know DKB was 
also hired by Enron as the financial advisor to the Cuiaba project. We have 
about 800k to pay DKB at financial closint. Can you check to see  how DKB 
does not have a conflict of interest in this work. They need to either cease 
all work on the Petrobras transaction or terminate their work and rights to a 
fee for Cuiaba. Let me know what you think or if you need any more info

On Friday we distributed  RFPs for securing bridge gas.   Letters went today 
to Chaco, TotalfinaElf, Andina, Maxus, BritishGas and Petrobras for them to 
quote us 6-month gas with our option to extend for another 6 months.  We have 
given them until March 2nd to respond.

Pete Weidler will meet with YPF (hopefully with Ernesto Lopez Anad?n) the 
week of the 19th.

Hi Mike,

Thanks for the update.  Unfortunately, the Civic Club is unable to run the
article in The Islander, because of its political nature.  President Kathleen
Gay reviewed the article, as it was previously written, and advised me last
night that it is against Civic Club policy and bylaws to be involved in
political issues.

If you have questions or comments, please contact Kathleen.

Randy,

Here's my resume.  Thanks taking the time to look over it.  I am very eager
to work at Enron and learn more about the energy industry.  As you can tell
from my resume,  I don't have the typical business background, however I am
willing to learn and thrive on challenging situations.

I have actually interviewed with you before for this type of position, and
look forward to meeting you again.

Thanks again,
Mike Montgomery

Two agreements have been negotiated with Siemens as part of the plant 
turnover for Provisional Completion Phase III on oil: 1) the EOT Claim 
Agreement between Siemens and SCC and 2) modifications to the TAA between 
Siemens and EPE.

The changes which the lenders should review are as follows:

EOT Claim Agreement

14 Day Availability Test with respect to Provisional Completion Phase III on 
oil, on a look-back basis over 6 months, required as a specific performance 
requirement
After PC on oil, Siemens can demobilize
Compensation for commissioning on oil $5,720,000; $30,000 per day for owner 
delay
Bonus of $15,000 per day that PC achieved before 17 Feb
Phase III Substantial Completion on gas
60 days prior written notice on gas availability
If sound level guarantees demonstrated on oil, only need to demonstrate far 
field sound on gas
Owner must operate and maintain per O&M manuals and industry practices on 
oil; if not, owner must correct items materially affecting Contractor's 
commissioning obligations
Performance guarantees remain in tact per EPC
Long stop date on Phase III Substantial Completion on gas of 31 Dec 01
Substantial Completion on gas - punchlist limited to deficiencies from Work 
performed to achieve Substantial Completion on gas
Risk of Loss remains with owner during commisioning on gas
Siemens agrees to enter into negotiations to provide operational assistance
Degradation - agree to use curves with credit to owner for degradation during 
commissioning
Compensation for commissioning on natural gas $1,220,000 lump sum; $20,000 
per day for owner delay
Warranty - 6 months after Provisional Completion on oil
Option to buy extended warranty for up to 6 months at $175,000; must elect 60 
days prior to expiration of Primary Warranty Period
Performance LD's on gas per the EPC contract with first $4,000,000 forgiven 
by owner
Delay LD's on gas do not start until 60 days after performance test on gas
Payments to be paid (including EOTof $5,720,000): 15 Feb  $5,446,141; 28 Feb  
$14,353,401 with offset of $4,000,000 for Phase I LD payment due from Siemens 
to SCC
Late payment interest rate of 14%

TAA Agreement

Effective date Provisional Completion Phase III on oil
No 12 month look back
12 month Initial Guarantee Period, with the clock suspended for gas 
commissioning unless owner delay. 


Additional Insurance

In order to provide the lenders an adequate warranty period on gas (if there 
are additional delays on the P/L) our Insurance group has  indicated that we 
will have no problem obtaining 12 months renewable business interruption 
insurance when we go operational on gas.  This should solve the issue over 
the revised warranty with Siemens because it covers defects, design, and 
workmanship on the turbines and includes lost profits, etc.  Incidentally, 
for insurance purposes the turbines are designated DE3 which is not a new 
technology designation.   The duration of BI coverage is 18 months per event 
with US$150,000 deductible.
Typically we will always have this coverage in place but if their is a 
supplier warranty then the party providing the warranty pays ahead of the 
insurer.  In the case where the supplier does not pay or the warranty has 
ended then the insurer is the primary.


We will need to execute these agreements immediately.  Please advise with 
your thoughts as soon as possible..

All,

I just wanted to give you a heads up on this, since it will in the future 
have an impact on your groups.  We are in the process of working with IT to 
develop several enhancements to unify that will enable us to at first obtain 
the reports to more accurately book various types of deals such as storage 
and agency deals.   The second phase will be to automate unify so that the 
recording of the deals can move directly from unify to SAP.  The end goal is 
to have unify and the GL as close as possible mirror what is in sitara and 
the P&L, thus minimizing UAF and OA exposure.  

One of the items that is to be addressed during these enhancements is to have 
the desk associated with each of the deals in unify.  This will allow us to 
split pipelines across desks for end reporting uses just as we do in the 
P&L.  We are also hoping to move to a process where we will be settling on 
all of our desk to desk deals through the actualization process which will 
reduce the UAF exposure.  How this will impact your groups is that once we 
move to this phase, we will need to have all desk to desk deals be assigned a 
meter and pathed as a buy/sell so that these deals will flow into unify.  

I know that this will cause additional work on your end, so I wanted to give 
you at least some forewarning that this topic would be coming up over the 
next few  months  and as much preparation time as possible.  Please feel free 
to let me know of any concerns or ideas that you might have.  As I said 
before, we are only just now beginning talks with IT to develop these 
enhancements, so I would foresee that this will not be an issue for a month 
or two.  

Thanks for all your help!  

Kathy

I was reviewing the pictures you sent.  You are not only an adventuress but 
also a Goddess.  Happy Valentines day.

I turned Pete down on the offer to stay.  I guess I'm just ready to move on 
and this feels pretty dead end here.  But I'll try and catch up with you from 
time to time if I can.

Mr. Gay,

My name is Daniel Lisk, your new Gas Scheduler.  I'm slated to begin work on
the Monday the 18th, and must say I am VERY excited to get started.  It will
be an honor to work for Enron.  I know I am just beginning a long and
productive career with an amazing company.

I received your email address from Molly Magee.  I had a few questions
regarding Holiday plans and start-day preparation and she directed me to
this email address.  I know you are very busy, so please reply at your
convenience.

My first question regards holiday planning.  If I remember correctly, it was
mentioned someone was working or on call one weekend a month.  It may be too
early to tell, but if I'm scheduled to work that weekend (December 22nd -
25th) I would like to make plans accordingly.  My mother in Missouri can be
very persistent (aka annoying) and wants to know my plans.

Also, I would like to put my name first on volunteers to work that weekend.
However, I understand my lack of experience may prevent me from accepting
that responsibility this soon.  If I will not be working, may I ask that you
tell me what days I will have off.  I need to know if I should buy a plane
ticket, get my car serviced for the drive, or make plans in Houston.

Finally, I've bought a training video covering Excel and begun reading a
book titled "Trading Natural Gas", by Fletcher J. Sturm (former senior
trader of natural gas derivatives for Enron Capital and Trade).  I want to
start contributing from day one and would like to know if there is anything
I can do to facilitate that.  Any other programs, books, push-up and
crunches, you could suggest would be aggressively pursued.

I look forward to seeing you again next week Mr. Gay.  My schedule on Monday
appears to be; "New Hire Training" from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm.  If possible, I
can be on your floor early to observe, leave for training from 8 to 4, then
return at 4:10 pm and stay until the close of business if you like?

Thank you.

Respectfully,



Daniel D. Lisk

Pete,

The F/M relief sited may not apply in all instances because technically we 
may have failed to preserve our rights by not notifying Furnas for 6 months.  
They have responded as such although they have not assessed any penalties to 
date.  The real test is may 4 when we are supposed to be in Phase 3 on Gas.

Subject: Re: Period after commissioning on oil - PPA availability penalties 
vs. diesel cost exposure  

Pete,

 There are two types of penalties under the PPA for the account of EPE (the 
latter can be used as a hedge to diesel cost exposure and we don't have any 
penalties right now)

(1) Delay penalties in being unable to provide the guaranteed capacity of 480 
MW on gas starting May 4, 2001 (this is where the Force Majeure extension is 
able to provide relief). The penalties here are calculated as R$ 400 per 
delayed MW per day. 

(2) Penalties due to capacity shortfall (basically - are we able to meet 
dispatch requests). If the moving average of the monthly average of the 
projects equivalent availability, calculated in accordance with provisions of 
annex-7 of the PPA, is less than 92%, a penalty shall be assessed in the 
amount of monthly capacity portion of the tariff for each phase times the 
guaranteed capacity for the phase multiplied by (92% - moving average of the 
monthly availability).

Penalties type (1) does not apply in the concept analyzed as it relates to 
delay in gas (Force Majeure Claim issue). 

Refusing a dispatch request above 220 MW has an impact on penalties type (2) 
(guaranteed capacity is 300 MW). Given that the plant currently has a moving 
average of the monthly availability of about 99.7%, there is a margin built 
up that can be used to accept an availability hit by refusing a dispatch 
request above 220 MW. Therefore, to avoid the huge fuel costs associated with 
being dispatched above 220 MW, the PPA availability penalty concept can be 
utilized as an alternative. If we continue to decline to be dispatched above 
220 MW for a long period however, the built up margin will be reduced and 
eventually we'll have to pay penalties because the 12-month moving average 
moves below 92%.

Please let me know if additional questions

Stacy Dickson called, and she said penalties for non-performance in the past 
have been handled by supplying information to Legal and they will then write 
a letter to the counterparty stating that per the contract you were supposed 
to deliver X but you didn't perform, so now you owe us $Y.  I asked her what 
she would need to do this and she gave me the following list of items.  
Please coordinate getting this to her - the spreadsheet you prepared may 
already have the volume comparison, prices, and penalty calc in it - we just 
need to get copies of the confirms and contracts.  Let me know if you have 
any questions.  Thanks.

Hi Kathleen, Randy, Chris, and Trish,

Attached is the text of the August issue of The Islander.  The headings will
be lined up when Trish adds the art and ads.  A calendar, also, which is in
the next e-mail.

I'll appreciate your comments by the end of tomorrow, Monday.

There are open issues which I sure hope get resolved before printing:

1.  I'm waiting for a reply from Mike Bass regarding tenses on the Home Depot
article.  Don't know if there's one developer or more and what the name(s)
is/are.

2.  Didn't hear back from Ted Weir regarding minutes for July's water board
meeting.  I think there are 2 meetings minutes missed, 6/22 and July.

3.  Waiting to hear back from Cheryl Hanks about the 7/6 City Council and 6/7
BOA meetings minutes.

4.  Don't know the name of the folks who were honored with Yard of the Month.
 They're at 509 Narcissus.

I'm not feeling very good about the missing parts but need to move on
schedule!  I'm also looking for a good dictionary to check the spellings of
ettouffe, tree-house and orneryness.  (Makes me feel kind of ornery, come to
think about it!)

Please let me know if you have revisions.  Hope your week is starting out
well.

Let me know what the procedure is (i.e. do I interview, will an anlyst just 
be assigned to me, etc.)  I had already talked to Mason Hamlin before, and he 
opted for another rotation, although he was perffectly acceptable to me.  So 
let me know what I need to do and when I could expect an analyst.  Also, a 
new hire analyst is acceptable.  Thanks.

Subject: Re: EPE Dispatch  

Rob,

Regarding items 1 and 2, please contact Lucio Reis in Sao Paulo office and he 
can explain.

Item 3 is incorrect. The 300 MW would be generated by the two gas turbines at 
about 100 MW each and the remaining 100 MW coming from the steam turbine. The 
steam turbine receives its energy from the exit gases from the gas turbines 
and they both contribute equally to the resulting steam turbine output 
(theoretically at least, in practice depending on optimization of machines)

Again, please talk with Lucio.

Regards,

Christiaan

Subject: EPE Dispatch

Here is what we have concluded based on discussions this morning:

1) We believe that Furnas has agreed to contract and pay for 300 MW on oil to 
meet regulatory requirements concerning required capacity and reserve 
margin.  We do not believe that they intend for us to be dispatrched above 
220 MW. (Do we have any document which could substantiate this?)

2) Although  dispatch on a merit order basis would suggest that EPE runs full 
time (with 300 MW available),  there are practical constraints in the 
transmission system which will prohibit this from actually occuring. [ Please 
describe these constraints using some official sounding jargon but minimal 
detail and in particular indicate what is involved to de-bottleneck and how 
long this will take.  I presume that Furnas is solely responsible for the 
corrective measures.]

3) Based on our analysis, the optimal operating approach would be to generate 
220MW with  one turbine and 91 MW with the other for a total of 311 if 
dipatched above 220 MW.

If we can prove that 1) & 2) are correct or convince the lenders that they 
are, then I think we can suggest that fuel oil exposure is negligibe if gas 
is ready by April 01.  We will have to see how it looks when we add the Sue 
Garvin flex months.

Therefore, a merit order analysis is only necessary if i) our supposition 
about Furnas' motivations are incorrect and/or ii) the transmission problem 
is cleared.  If this happens it would be nice to be able to predict reduced 
fuel utilization due to a) reduced dispatch during daily off-peak hours or 
seasonal impacts, b) due to scheduled outages, and c) due to managing our 
availabilty in such a way as to reduce fuel consumption operating losses.  
Any data you can provide will be helpful.


Have I successfully connected the dots here?

If you have previously sent these materials to Felipe or Tracee please simply 
grumble to yourself if you have to do an extra e-mail to me.  Remember, you 
don't have to be nice to a short timer unless you need them to get something 
done.


Regards,

Rob

Subject: Questions re: Siemens Negotiations




Rob - We've reviewed your memo which sets forth general points of your
negotiations with Siemens.  Following are comments and questions regarding
certain negotiated points:

EOT Claim Agreement

Owner must operate and maintain per O&M manuals and industry practices on oil;
if not, owner must correct items materially affecting Contractor's 
commissioning
obligations

We observe that while this point places reasonable responsibility on the Owner
to correct problems that were a result of their commercial operations, it is
introduces an opportunity for the Contractor to place unfounded blame on the
owner for affecting the Contractor's ability to commission.

Risk of Loss remains with owner during commissioning on gas

We understand that the Facility is under the care, custody and control of the
Owner and that the Facility is currently operating under the insurance 
coverage
intended for the commercial operating period (versus the construction period).
Please confirm that there is no reason to be concerned about insurance 
coverage
if a problem arises resulting in material damage attributable to Contractor
action during commissioning on gas.  We are also advising the Lenders to have
this point reviewed by an insurance advisor.

Degradation - agree to use curves with credit to owner for degradation during
commissioning

During our last conference call it was indicated that the first choice was to
test to determine degradation and the alternative was to agree on a set of
curves.  It appears that Siemens was unwilling to agree to the test approach.
We observe that the curves used to determine owner credit may be biased to the
benefit of Siemens.  We trust that your operations experts will diligently
review the basis for the curves.

Performance LD's on gas per the EPC contract with first $4,000,000 forgiven by
owner

Please explain the rationale behind forgiving $4 million of Contractor LDs.

Delay LD's on gas do not start until 60 days after performance test on gas

During our last conference call it was indicated that there would be a stand
down until 7/1/01 when gas is available, no LDs would be paid related to oil
firing performance, and that the LD clock would start if gas commissioning is
not complete within 60 days.  We do not understand the above negotiated point.
Please confirm that our understanding is correct or clarify your negotiated
point.

TAA Agreement

No 12-month look back.

We assume that this negotiated point is related to the time period factored 
into
the availability calculation for purposes of determining whether or not an
extension or additional work by the Contractor has been triggered as a result 
of
dropping below the availability standards.  Please explain how this negotiated
point affects the mechanics of the TAA and also please explain how 
availability
will be calculated.  As we noted during our last conference call, we are
concerned that Siemens believes that the availability value is not reduced if
maintenance work is being performed during periods when the Facility is not
being dispatched.

12 month Initial Guarantee Period, with the clock suspended for gas
commissioning unless owner delay.

We interpret the above negotiated point to mean that the 12-month clock for 
the
initial guarantee period stops during commissioning regardless of how long it
takes the Contractor to commission on gas (unless delays are attributable to
Owner) and re-starts after Contractor has successfully completed the 
performance
testing on gas.  Please confirm that our understanding is correct.

In order to provide the lenders an adequate warranty period on gas (if
there are additional delays on the P/L) our Insurance group has  indicated
that we will have no problem obtaining 12 months renewable business
interruption insurance when we go operational on gas.  This should solve
the issue over the revised warranty with Siemens because it covers defects,
design, and workmanship on the turbines and includes lost profits, etc.
Incidentally, for insurance purposes the turbines are designated DE3 which
is not a new technology designation.   The duration of BI coverage is 18
months per event with US$150,000 deductible.

Stone & Webster is advising the Lenders to have an insurance advisor review 
this
point.

Thanks in advance for your response.  Hope all is well.

Regards,

Bradley

Subject: Siemens negotiations


Two agreements have been negotiated with Siemens as part of the plant 
turnover for Provisional Completion Phase III on oil: 1) the EOT Claim 
Agreement between Siemens and SCC and 2) modifications to the TAA between 
Siemens and EPE.

The changes which the lenders should review are as follows:

EOT Claim Agreement

14 Day Availability Test with respect to Provisional Completion Phase III on 
oil, on a look-back basis over 6 months, required as a specific performance 
requirement
After PC on oil, Siemens can demobilize
Compensation for commissioning on oil $5,720,000; $30,000 per day for owner 
delay
Bonus of $15,000 per day that PC achieved before 17 Feb
Phase III Substantial Completion on gas
60 days prior written notice on gas availability
If sound level guarantees demonstrated on oil, only need to demonstrate far 
field sound on gas
Owner must operate and maintain per O&M manuals and industry practices on 
oil; if not, owner must correct items materially affecting Contractor's 
commissioning obligations
Performance guarantees remain in tact per EPC
Long stop date on Phase III Substantial Completion on gas of 31 Dec 01
Substantial Completion on gas - punchlist limited to deficiencies from Work 
performed to achieve Substantial Completion on gas
Risk of Loss remains with owner during commisioning on gas
Siemens agrees to enter into negotiations to provide operational assistance
Degradation - agree to use curves with credit to owner for degradation during 
commissioning
Compensation for commissioning on natural gas $1,220,000 lump sum; $20,000 
per day for owner delay
Warranty - 6 months after Provisional Completion on oil
Option to buy extended warranty for up to 6 months at $175,000; must elect 60 
days prior to expiration of Primary Warranty Period
Performance LD's on gas per the EPC contract with first $4,000,000 forgiven 
by owner
Delay LD's on gas do not start until 60 days after performance test on gas
Payments to be paid (including EOTof $5,720,000): 15 Feb  $5,446,141; 28 Feb  
$14,353,401 with offset of $4,000,000 for Phase I LD payment due from Siemens 
to SCC
Late payment interest rate of 14%

TAA Agreement

Effective date Provisional Completion Phase III on oil
No 12 month look back
12 month Initial Guarantee Period, with the clock suspended for gas 
commissioning unless owner delay. 


Additional Insurance

In order to provide the lenders an adequate warranty period on gas (if there 
are additional delays on the P/L) our Insurance group has  indicated that we 
will have no problem obtaining 12 months renewable business interruption 
insurance when we go operational on gas.  This should solve the issue over 
the revised warranty with Siemens because it covers defects, design, and 
workmanship on the turbines and includes lost profits, etc.  Incidentally, 
for insurance purposes the turbines are designated DE3 which is not a new 
technology designation.   The duration of BI coverage is 18 months per event 
with US$150,000 deductible.
Typically we will always have this coverage in place but if their is a 
supplier warranty then the party providing the warranty pays ahead of the 
insurer.  In the case where the supplier does not pay or the warranty has 
ended then the insurer is the primary.


We will need to execute these agreements immediately.  Please advise with 
your thoughts as soon as possible..

Hey guys:  just to follow up after our discussion this morning on unfinaled 
invoices, the following will be our procedures.

10th day of month:  invoices sent out
1st business day after 10th:  we will get the unfinaled invoice report from 
settlements and start working on clearing all discrepancies.  We will have 
all discrepancies cleared by the 5th work day after the 10th.
25th day of month:  purchase stuff goes out.
1st work day after 25th:  unfinaled invoice report from settlements, same 
timetable to clear all discrepancies.

Remember:  a discrepancy will consist of anything that could hold an invoice 
from going out the door.  
We need to be very receptive to other groups in helping them clear these up.  
We know more about these deals than anyone, so let's be helpful.
Let's also try to clear these up in a way so as to avoid causing these 
problems in the future, if we can.  

Thanks in advance for everyone's help.

Subject: BRS Accomplishments - 2000


Rob, listed below are my key accomplishments for 2000:

1) TGS:

-Key member of TGS Finance Committee; attended quarterly meetings, 
participated in major financing decisions and made recommendations to TGS 
and/or ESA management. 

-During 2000, assisted TGS finance staff in refinancing $300MM of 
non-recourse debt in two separate transactions;  a 3 year $150MM bank FRN, 
and a 3 year $150MM Eurobond issue.  Role included helping evaluate lead 
arranger proposals and term sheets, selecting lead arrangers and participants 
and participating in road shows representing Enron sponsorship.  Successfully 
raised $300MM during a very challenging time in Argentina as well as a very 
difficult time for the U.S. capital markets (i.e., Eurobond completed 
immediately following the largest single drop in history of the NASDAQ).  

2) TRANSREDES:

a) $10MM Liquidity Facility:  Lead approval and documentation effort for 
$10MM Enron-provided credit facility to provide liquidity for oil spill clean 
up expenditures and  Cuiaba construction cash calls.  Prepared DASH, managed 
approval process wtih RAC and TRSA management, and lead documentation to 
closure.  Loan was successfully repaid with proceeds from the Cuiaba buy-out 
transaction.  Credit facility allowed TRSA to avoid a severe liquidity crisis 
which could have stopped the clean up process and put its concession from the 
Bolivian government at risk.

b) Buy-out of TRSA's interests in the Cuiaba Project:  Selected for lead role 
in Enron's buy out of 50% of TRSA's interest in the Cuiaba Project for $40MM 
(Enron's share).  Prepared DASH and ESA risk committee and Enron Corp. board 
presentations, worked with RAC to obtain approval for transaction and 
coordinated legal documentation process with counsel (internal and external) 
and partners (Shell as co-buyer, TRSA as seller).  

Buy-out transaction restored much needed liquidity to TRSA's balance sheet 
and permitted Enron and Shell to move ahead on the Cuiaba financing without 
having to guarantee TRSA's pro-rata share of contingent sponsor support 
required by the Cuiaba lenders.  Restored liquidity to TRSA will permit it to 
meet its working capital needs until May 2001 when its new tariffs become 
effective (post Transition period).

c) Cuiaba Contingent Sponsor Support: In coordination with TRSA/Cuiaba 
buy-out effort, assisted Cuiaba team in obtaining approval of contingent 
sponsor support for OPIC/KfW financing.  Prepared DASH and worked with RAC to 
obtain internal approval and assisted in preparing ESA risk committee and 
Enron Corp. board presentations.  Contingent support package along with 
buy-out transaction was approved by Enron's board. 

c) Financial Advisory Assignment:

Selected by TRSA and ESA management to work with TRSA in a financial advisory 
capacity, to advise and assist in the arrangement of up to $700MM in new 
third party debt over the next 4 years to finance TRSA capital expansion 
program.  In exchange for such services ESA began receiving a $12,500/month 
retainer fee (October 2000 - May 2001 = $100,000 of fee income) plus the 
reimbursement of all out-of-pocket expenses.  

Roadshow with U.S. Exim, Bolivian pension funds, local banks and 
international banks with local presence and CAF now completed.  Assisting 
TRSA management with resolution of Supreme Decree and Tariff Reset and 
existing debt seniority issue.

GTB:

a) Financial Advisory Assignment:  Selected by GTB and ESA management to work 
with GTB in a financial advisory capacity, to advise and assist in the 
arrangement of up to $210MM in new third party debt over the next 4 years to 
finance GTB's capital expansion program.  In exchange for such services, ESA 
began receiving a $12,500/month retainer fee (October 2000 - May 2001 = 
$100,000 of fee income) plus the reimbursement of all out-of-pocket 
expenses.  

Roadshow with U.S. Exim, Bolivian pension funds, local banks and 
international banks with local presence and CAF now completed.  Letter of 
Interest obtained from U.S. Exim.  Working with GTB management to finalize 
credit rating process and clean up commercial contracts for financing. 

TRAINING:  Completed Executive Impact training course (requirement for 2000).

In the event you did not receive the amount of manager/peer feedback that you 
would like to see to prepare my review, I do have the feedback booklet that I 
got recently from the Executive Impact course that you could use.  I have it 
in my office...I can have Blanca get it for you if you want to see it.

Thanks for your support.

Subject: ECA


I attach DWS/Shell comments on the latest version of the ECA.  The comments
appear in the text in bold caps, underlined.

The following also need to be included in the draft:

1.  provisions for sponsor guarantee buyout, once agreed; and

2.  a provision along the lines of Section 7.06 of the TBS Security
Agreement (relating to step-in to the TBS agreements) so as to give
SOTL/Enron Corp privity in relation to these rights.  (This point was agreed
with Mary some time ago in one of the New York meetings.)

Consideration also needs to be given as to whether there should be express
recognition of the rights of STDC and Enron Netherlands to subscribe subdebt
under the ECA.

Regards

Subject: ?? Re: KX/UNIFY interface schedule

Hi Ladies!

As you know, we are working with Matt Pena and Dave N. re:  KX/UNIFY 
interfaces.  Matt and Dave proposed the following order with respect to 
release functionality.  Please review and let us know if anything should be 
in a different order.  

As you can imagine, (1)  the UNIFY team will not be able to do everything at 
once AND (2) we want to start testing/using the system as soon as possible.  
You will, however have some influence in changing this order if you think it 
is appropriate.  We should target things that give you and your customer the 
biggest bang for your buck.

FYI-we will also go over this list with your managers in the demo tomorrow.

1.  UNIFY sends transport contracts to KX
2.  UNIFY sends psna's to KX
3.  UNIFY sends upstream and downstream K# to KX
4.  UNIFY receives upstream and downstream K# from KX
5.  UNIFY will "undo" upstream and downstream K#
6.  UNIFY will receive buy/sell (brokered) path instructions from KX
7.  UNIFY will "undo" buy/sell (brokered) path instructions
8.  UNIFY will receive psna's from KX
9.  UNIFY will "undo" psna's from KX

Thanks,
Carrie

P.S.  Could we live without #2 and #3?  This appears difficult to implement, 
and we would like to guage the cost/benefit.  

Without #2 and #3, UNIFY only sends KX transport contracts and receives all 
other data.  In other words, upstreams, downstreams, and psna's would have to 
be entered into KX for the user to see them.  They would, however, interface 
back to UNIFY once entered.  However, if entered only in UNIFY and not in KX, 
then they would not show up in KX.  Give us your thoughts. . .

Rick,

In preparation for the meeting with the lenders on Tuesday I was reviewing 
the GSA and I wonder if YPF has any force majeure claims which could impede 
our rights to terminate.  I know they indicated at least verbally that they 
had encountered some problems in Argentina.  Although a stretch has Dean or 
Novak indicated that this could be a defense?

See the translation of Furnas  response of Feb 8.

1) They are not signing the Consent.

2)  Questions the FM claim

3) Raises the need to come up with tariff for a period not initially 
contemplated in the Contract (This needs to be done irrespective of the 
Consent issue)

4) Questions the Economic equilibrium revision if not approved be Aneel 

5) Raises MAE exposure for the project

I appreciate your inviting the Risk group on this outing.  I understand about 
the ticket issue, but the gesture is what counts anyway.

Thanks again.

Title: Meeting With Furnas - Jan 29 01 - Tariff until Gas Commisioning

Furnas:  Celso Ferreira, Roberto de la Nina
EPE: Jose Bestard, Laine Powell, Christiaan Huzier
Consent.- Before entering into the purpose of the meeting, I told Celso that 
we were sending him a letter to confirm our understanding from the previous 
meeting, that they are linking the approval of the Anex 4/Consent to changes 
in the contact. and that they refused to sign the original consent language. 
For avoidance of doubt, the text of both versions are included in the letter.
He said that our understanding was correct and that he would answer in the 
affirmative.
He was not familiar with the original text. I showed him my copy with the 
three initials. He asked whose initials were from Furnas. (I don't know - was 
not present at that meeting. Rick  and John may know).
Roberto de la Nina gave him the background from Furnas side.
Tariff and Commissioning. 
Celso started the session by drawing a diagram of the Contractual Obligation 
provisions compared to the Current Situation. He wanted to lead us  to pay 
the fuel differential, from 100% dispatch or alternatively buy from the MAE 
(lower cost to us).  
[Comment.- Irrespective of  the Force Majeure arguments that we have, the MAE 
make up possibility has to be used carefully to avoid  falling into the trap, 
by precedent, or assuming a market exposure that we presently do not have.]
I replied that his reading of the Contract was correct, except that he did 
not read the Force Majeure section.  We had the obligation to change to gas 
on the dates he mentioned, except that we have a Force Majeure due to the 
Government Actions, and therefore we have the right to change the schedule.
Celso replied that his people did not think this fit the case; i.e. 
"additional difficulty of drilling through rocks"; I replied that we have a 
strong case that everyone  knows about, including the regulator Aneel, which 
extended the use of the CCC until June 2001.
[Comment.- I expect Furnas to challenge our documentation to calculate how 
many days we are entitled due to FM causes. At the end there will be a 
"negotiated agreement", or the result or arbitration.]
Aneel Authorization.-  I told him that we needed to bring him up to date 
about Aneel's approval.
 Aneel sent us a letter that we were not authorized to operate in Combined 
Cycle, not that we had CCC account coverage during for CC operation.
Gave him a copy of the letter of our request to Aneel asking for both ; CC 
and CCC coverage. We were ready for 480 MW, but on diesel.
Celso asked what we would do if we got CC authorization but not CCC 
coverage.- I told him that we did not have the money to pay for the fuel, 
that we would have to convert back to Simple Cycle, use the current 
authorization for minimum use and wait  for the gas to be available to go 
through commissioning.
He said that under the contract we are obligated to provide power; that he 
would buy from the MAE and sent us the bill. I told him that under the 
Contract we can change the gas-change-over date because of FM. During a FM 
period our mutual obligations would cease, except that they in this case they 
had a capacity payment obligation given that the cause was Government 
action.  
He understood that they have a right to cancel the Contract after 12 months 
[Comment - but they would have the MAE exposure as well for the Initial 
Contracts]
Laine gave him an update of the ridge contruction and the parallel path that 
we will take on Ridge 10; drill and also seek a permit for a partial crossing 
of the first crest, drilling through the second crest, all withing the 
existing ROW.
Laine explained the processes and limitatios of returnind to SC operations 
and then back again to CC gas comissioning.

Our Proposal.-  Our proposal is that we get authorization to enter into 
operation as combined cycle unit; the CCC administration pays for the diesel, 
and receives the gas revenues as compensation. This keeps us and Furnas at 
the Contract equilibrium, and the Brazilian electric system has 480 MW 
combined cycle plant; providing stability to that area.
Under this proposal, until the gas gets there to start commissioning, ONS 
would dispatch the power plant according to economic dispatch at R$110/Mwhr; 
minimum 290 MW. The CCC covers the actual dispatch the MRE cover the dispatch 
to the Initial Contracts with Furnas.
I suggested that they join us for that petition to Aneel. He called Mario 
Santos to set up a meeting, to enlist the help of ONS in that petition as 
well.
The meeting is set up for Wednesday at 9:30 AM.   To prepare we need to 
provide the factual information, heat rates, costs, etc.

I spoke with Mary Mervene this morning and the llenders declined to convene 
this week although we will arrange an ECA call for Thursday or Friday.  Mary 
has requested that we do the following:

1) Send the Lenders and S&W the new budget info and the revised change order 
summary.

2) Revise the model to reflect the new costs and the new timeline.

3) S&W will review the model and then we will repeat the exercise of 
calculating fuel oil and Furnas penalty exposures.

4) Finalize sponsor support elements.

This can all occur fairly quickly except I am concerned because we have not 
resolved the budget with Shell,  and theoretically the lenders can take 30 
days to review the model and budget when submitted.

We also need to discuss strategy because we may want to delete the 
contingency from the budget since the lenders are going to want the sponsors 
to commit to some general contingency supporty anyway.

Subject: Unify stress test next week with Sybase 12.0

We have done some preliminary testing of the latest version of Sybase 
(version 12).  We have seen very positive results from our initial tests and 
would like to proceed with a "stress test" (not to be confused with me 
showing up each day at work).  We would like to do 2 tests next week due to 
hardware and business restrictions.

The test would be similar to those from late-1998 (ah, those were the 
days!).  We will ask all users, as well as I.T. folks, to run as many of 
their usual processing during a scripted time frame from approx noon - 1:30pm 
on Tuesday and Wednesday. Be sure to order some yummy pizza or sandwiches for 
your staff!

The Sybase 12.0 environment can be accessed via Start/Programs/Test 
Applications/Unify Applications/Unify Gas-Power Stage.  On the Login window, 
select server = "ASE 12 Test".  If you usual Production password does not 
work, try "houston".  If that does not work, try a neighbor's (Audit says 
that fine, its just a test).  Each user should plan to run several sessions 
where permissible to simulate a heavy load on the system and to make up for 
those not able to participate during this time.  Please have your staff try 
to login some time Monday to insure they have access.

The test script during the time period will be:
12:00 - 1:30 Logistics:  pathing, nominating, running some reports
12:20 - 1:30 Volume Management: do your thing
12:40 - 1:30 Settlements/Accounting:  pile in

Please let me know if your area would NOT be able to assist in this very 
important test.  The results of these 2 tests will dictate whether we should 
pursue our migration to this new release in mid-July.  The less bid weeks 
with poor system performance the better!

Thanks in advance for your help, d.n.

The lenders would like a list of the potential producers in Bolivia for 
Cuiaba I and if info is available on their holdings please provide that as 
well.  Can we also give the details of the Vintage transaction as an example 
of our capabilities?   If their consent is required can you obtain?

KFW is ok on relying solely on the back-up fuel supply support but OPIC is 
not there yet.

Also, KFW is offering to allow us to go back to floating on interest rate. 
They will provide the cost within the next 24 hours, but they have indicated 
that it will be significantly less than US$250,000 for a current estimated 
annual savings of 60 bps.  This sounds like a good move to me.

their absence.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 2000 nominees
are:<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMINEE No. 1: [San Jose Mercury
News]:<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An unidentified man, using a shotgun
like a club to break a former<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; girlfriend's
windshield, accidentally shot himself to death
when<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the gun discharged, blowing a hole in his
gut<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMINEE No. 2: [Kalamazoo
Gazette]<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James Burns, 34, (a mechanic) of
Alamo, Mich., was killed in March<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as he was
trying to repair what police describe as a "farm
type<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; truck." Burns got a friend to drive the
truck on a highway while<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burns hung underneath
so that he could ascertain the source of a<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
troubling noise. Burns' clothes caught on something, however,
and<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the other man found Burns "wrapped in the
drive shaft."<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMINEE No. 3:
[Hickory Daily Record]<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ken Charles Barger, 47,
accidentally shot himself to death in<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; December
in Newton, N.C. Awakening to the sound of a
ringing<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; telephone beside his bed, he reached
for the phone but grabbed<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; instead a Smith
Wesson .38 Special, which discharged when he
drew<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it to his
ear.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMINEE No. 4: [UPI,
Toronto]<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police said a lawyer demonstrating
the safety of windows in a<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; downtown Toronto
skyscraper crashed through a pane with his<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
shoulder and plunged 24&nbsp; floors to his death. A police
spokesman<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; said Garry Hoy, 39, fell into the
courtyard of the Toronto<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dominion Bank Tower
early Friday evening as he was explaining the<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
strength of the building's windows to visiting law students.
Hoy<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; previously has conducted demonstration of
window strength<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; according to police reports.
Peter Lawyers, managing partner of<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the firm
Holden Day Wilson, told the Toronto Sun newspaper
that<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hoy was "one of the best and brightest"
members of the 200-man<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
association.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMINEE No. 5:
[Bloomsburg News Service]<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A terrible diet and
room with no ventilation are being blamed for<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the death of a man who was killed by his own gas. There was
no<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mark on his body but an autopsy showed
large amounts of methane<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gas in his system.
His diet had consisted primarily of beans and<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
cabbage (and a couple of other things). It was just the
right<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; combination of foods. It appears that
the man died in his sleep<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from breathing the
poisonous cloud that was hanging over his bed.<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Had he been outside or had his windows been opened, it
wouldn't<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have been fatal.&nbsp; But the man
was shut up in his near air-tight<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
bedroom.&nbsp; According to the article, "He was a big man with a
huge<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; capacity for creating "this deadly gas."
Three of the rescuers got<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sick and one was
hospitalized.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMINEE No. 6: [The
News of the Weird.]<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michael Anderson Godwin
made news of the Weird posthumously. He<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had
spent several years awaiting South Carolina's electric
chair<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on a murder conviction before having his
sentence reduced to life<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in prison. Whilst
sitting on a metal toilet in his cell and<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
attempting to fix his small TV set, he bit into a wire and
was<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
electrocuted.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMINEE NO. 7: ["The
Indianapolis Star"].<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cigarette lighter may
have triggered fatal explosion in Dunkirk,<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Indiana.&nbsp; A Jay County man using a cigarette lighter to check
the<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; barrel of a muzzle loader was killed
Monday night when the weapon<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discharged in his
face, sheriff's investigators said. Gregory<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
David Pryor, 19, died in his parents' rural Dunkirk home
about<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11:30 pm.&nbsp; Investigators said Pryor
was cleaning a 54-caliber<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; muzzle loader that
had not been firing properly. He was using the<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
lighter to look into the barrel when the gunpowder
ignited<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMINEE No. 8: [Reuters,
Mississauga, Ontario] A man cleaning a<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bird
Feeder on the balcony of his condominium apartment in
this<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toronto suburb slipped and fell 23
stories to his death.&nbsp; Stefan<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Macko, 55,
was standing on a wheeled chair when the
accident<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; occurred, said Inspector D'Arcy Honer
of the Peel regional police.<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It appears the
chair moved and he went over the balcony,"
Honer<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
said.<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOMINEE No.9: [Arkansas
Democrat Gazette] Two local men were<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seriously
injured when their pick-up truck left the road
and<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struck a tree near Cotton Patch on State
Highway 38 early Monday<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; morning. Woodruff
County deputy Dovey Snyder reported the
accident<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shortly after midnight Monday.
Thurston Poole, 33, of Des Arc and<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Billy Ray
Wallis, 38, of Little Rock are listed in
serious<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; condition at Baptist Medical Center.
The accident occurred as the<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two men were
returning to Des Arc after a frog gigging trip. On
an<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overcast Sunday night, Poole's pick-up
truck headlights<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; malfunctioned.&nbsp; The two
men concluded that the headlight fuse on<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the
older model truck had burned out. As a replacement fuse
was<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not available,&nbsp; Wallis noticed that
the .22 caliber bullet from<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his pistol fit
perfectly into the fuse box next to the
steering<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wheel column.&nbsp; Upon inserting
the bullet, the headlights again<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; began to
operate properly and the two men proceeded on
east-bound<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; toward the White River bridge.
After traveling approximately 20<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; miles and
just before crossing the river, the bullet
apparently<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overheated, discharged and struck
Poole in the right testicle. The<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vehicle
swerved sharply to the right exiting the pavement
and<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; striking a tree. Poole suffered only minor
cuts and abrasions from<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the accident, but will
require surgery to repair the other wound.<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wallis sustained a broken clavicle and was treated and
released.<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank God we weren't on that bridge
when Thurston shot his balls<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; off or we might
both be dead" stated Wallis. "I've been a
trooper<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for ten years in this part of the
world, but this is a first for<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me. I can't
believe that those two would admit how this
accident<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; happened," said Snyder.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Upon being notified of the wreck,<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lavinia,
Poole's wife, asked how many frogs the boys had
caught<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and did anyone get them from the
truck.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Way to go,
Lavinia!)<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>&gt;<BR>&gt;<BR><BR><BR>

All - FYI, I would suggest copying this and keeping it handy so you can use 
off-hours when necessary (even though the help desk should do the contacting)


Alex - See me about this. I would like some of this info added to the second 
wallet cards your working on.

Susan,

I am planning to set up an on-call pager and cell phone for Unify Logistics.  
In the meanwhile, please use the following for any Unify Logistics support 
call you may receive:

Seq Name   Home  Pager   Cell
1) On Call Pager    713-284-3757 (not yet activated)
2) Dave Nommensen 281-558-9145 1-888-487-1865  713-562-3986
3) Dave McMullan  281-855-4106 713-285-4982
4) Trisha Luong  281-565-8149 713-285-8715

6) Benedicta (BT) Tung 281-565-9669 713-285-0931

There are several subsystems within Unify.  The above list is strictly

basis.
This does NOT cover the guys in Unify that do Settlements.

Once I have the on-call pager activated, I will let you know.

Thanks, d.n.

According to Cliff Shedd, we would be covered by insurance if we terminated 
the contract with Furnas and Furnas failed to pay the termination payment.  
However the insurers will only pay after we receive an arbitration judgement 
against them and the refuse to honor the judgement.  I assume we would also 
have to exhaust our remedies against trhe guarantor (Eletrobras).

Also, we are required to notify the underwriters immediately of a material 
default.

Mr. Gay,

My name is Daniel Lisk, your new Gas Scheduler.  I'm slated to begin work on
the Monday the 18th, and must say I am VERY excited to get started.  It will
be an honor to work for Enron.  I know I am just beginning a long and
productive career with an amazing company.

I received your email address from Molly Magee.  I had a few questions
regarding Holiday plans and start-day preparation and she directed me to
this email address.  I know you are very busy, so please reply at your
convenience.

My first question regards holiday planning.  If I remember correctly, it was
mentioned someone was working or on call one weekend a month.  It may be too
early to tell, but if I'm scheduled to work that weekend (December 22nd -
25th) I would like to make plans accordingly.  My mother in Missouri can be
very persistent (aka annoying) and wants to know my plans.

Also, I would like to put my name first on volunteers to work that weekend.
However, I understand my lack of experience may prevent me from accepting
that responsibility this soon.  If I will not be working, may I ask that you
tell me what days I will have off.  I need to know if I should buy a plane
ticket, get my car serviced for the drive, or make plans in Houston.

Finally, I've bought a training video covering Excel and begun reading a
book titled "Trading Natural Gas", by Fletcher J. Sturm (former senior
trader of natural gas derivatives for Enron Capital and Trade).  I want to
start contributing from day one and would like to know if there is anything
I can do to facilitate that.  Any other programs, books, push-up and
crunches, you could suggest would be aggressively pursued.

I look forward to seeing you again next week Mr. Gay.  My schedule on Monday
appears to be; "New Hire Training" from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm.  If possible, I
can be on your floor early to observe, leave for training from 8 to 4, then
return at 4:10 pm and stay until the close of business if you like?

Thank you.

Respectfully,



Daniel D. Lisk

Subject: Fwd: GE Letter Agreement


Alan,

In response to your e-mail, the Letter Agreement has not been further revised 
since I sent it to you on March 30th (that e-mail is attached hereto).

The open issues relate to the following items in Attachment 8 which contains 
certain provisions to be used as part of the "Base Agreement:"

1.  The issue detailed in the attached of whether WestLB will indemnify GEII 
against actions of the Enron entity acting as "Agent."  Rob Gay is reviewing 
this issue.  This issue would impact Section 20.1(a).

2.  The inclusion of certain language that Enron has requested which would 
more clearly establish that GEII's indemnity obligation includes 
consequential damage claims by third parties.  The language at issue appears 
in Sections 20.1(b) and 27.2.

At Brett Wiggs' request, Cheryl Costa is discussing the above issues with 
GEII.  If you have any questions or comments or would like to discuss the 
foregoing, please contact me at 713-655-5102.

please feel free to contact me at 713-655-5102.

Rob,

Attached please find the current draft of the Letter Agreement (32581.7), 
including Attachment 8 (32573.7) which sets forth various provisions to be 
included in the Purchase Agreement.  Article 20 regarding indemnification is 
included in Attachment 8.

As we discussed, West LB has some concerns regarding including language in 
Article 20 which GEII requested by which West LB would indemnify GEII for 
Enron's acts (in its capacity as Agent).  West LB has suggested they would be 
willing to undertake this obligation if they are reimbursed by Enron through 
the Acquisition and Development Agreement.  Today, for the first time, West 
LB indicated that they may require a cap on this liability for Agent's acts 
in the Purchase Agreement.

GEII has requested that West LB undertake this obligation and Enron has 
agreed to pursue it with West LB.  In light of this, the language which would 
establish West LB's indemnity obligation for the Agent's acts is not included 
in the current draft of Attachment 8.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  As I mentioned, we are 
trying to finalize the Letter Agreement with GEII very shortly.  I apologize 
for any confusion and look forward to working with you on this matter.  If 
you have any questions or would like to discuss this matter further, please 
feel free to contact me at 713-655-5102.

Thanks,
Vanessa.

Attached is the e-mail that I revised pursuant to our discussions.  I have 
also sent to Bob Carter, the ENA lawyer on the National Gypsum deal.  As you 
can see, he does not see any issues that would prevent sending to my contact 
at National Gypsum.

Do you have additional comments or changes?

(Also, I will pursue getting the name of the entity that sent it to National 
Gypsum.)

I want to send this to our customer, National Gypsum, but thought you
should review prior to it going out.  Do you have any comments?


I've talked with several people familar with gas sales and distribution in
the southwestern portion of the US.  Summarized below is their collective
response:

     1.   The pipeline capacity is limited due to an order by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and FERC has jurisdiction over the
interstate sale and distribution of natural gas.  The Department of
Transportation has jursidiction only over certain safety issues resulting
from the gas explosion.
     2.   The spot market has risen in the Arizona area -- currently it is
at $  __ for 30-day ___.  The reason prices are high is due to the
excessive demand in California for natural gas for its power plants.  Thus,
gas is flowing into California -- the only way gas will flow east away from
California is in response to higher prices.
     3.   Enron is not "holding back supplies to the area".  Enron is not a
producer of natural gas, does not have ANY physical supplies, and does not
have or utilize storage capacity in this area.  Also, Enron controls
pipeline capacity over the El Paso Gas Pipeline of only 80,000 cf per day
-- this pipeline has a capacity of 4 BILLION cf per day (at full capacity).
The dominant holder of capacity on this pipleline is a gas marketing
subsidiary of El Paso Gas.  Moreover, there are numerous marketers of
natural gas in the area, ensuring competition and pricing visibility and
liquidity.  Thus, there is no way that Enron could control or influence the
price of physical suppliles in the area.
     4.   Gas trading generally occurs over monthly or seasonal (e.g.,
winter) periods, not annual periods.  And, the winter season for which
marketers generally quote prices is considered to be November to March (not
on December 1 as the note below suggests).
     5.   Finally, Enron would not want to hold back physical supplies to
the area.  Enron is primarily a trader of natural gas, engaged in the
buying and selling of the non-physical and financial side of natural gas
supplies.  Through Enron On Line, Enron is both a seller AND a buyer,
making margins on trades of positions in natural gas.   Thus, Enron would
be disadvantaged by not selling gas positions, even if it could hold back
physical supplies to the area, because it is not engaged in buying and
selling of positions in natural gas.

Subject:  West Coast Gas


Rich,

The following information was included in an email that was sent to our
executives and CEO.  The tone leaves a negative impression for Enron.  Can
you or someone at Enron comment on Enron's role or lack thereof with
respect
to this item?  I am afraid this will taint our plans if not addressed
quickly.  I want to circulate Enron's side of the story.

Carol


Excerpt from email circulated today:

Due to the lingering effects of the August gas pipeline explosion in New
Mexico that killed 10 people, coupled with some possible market
manipulation
by Enron, we're facing a potential problem at Phoenix in the short term and
possibly all three western plants longer term.  The pipeline which is owned
by El Paso Gas is back in operation, but is being limited to 50% of
capacity.  Weather has turned cold, spiking demand for gas in the region.
Enron appears to be holding back supplies to the area until at least
December 1st, when many of its contracts set the index price for the
following year.  Consequently, gas prices on the spot market in Arizona are
hitting $25 per MMBTU.  The situation has caused several marketers to
declare force majeure.  If our marketer does so, we'll be curtailed.  As
you
probably know, we don't have any backup fuel capabilities at these three
plants.  The U.S. Dept of Transportation controls this and is reported to
be
getting involved.  Will keep you posted as it unfolds.

I noticed on your web site that you have a number of Joana Zjawinska's for 
sale including "Love, Life  & Money Suite 2"  (which we currently own) and 
"Startled".

I was wondering if you would consider a trade where we would provide "Love 
Life & Money" (framed) and we would receive "Startled"?
