Agave Energy - Agave and another producer, Comanche Gathering, are both 
looking to bring new gas onto TW's system in the Panhandle area.  We are 
reviewing available taps to bring 5-10,000 MMBtu/d into the system.  

EOG Resources - The new EOG well began flowing 13,500 MMBtu/d on 11/15 into 
the West Texas lateral.

PG&E - PG&E indicated this week they will increase TW's deliverability by 25% 
from 300,000 to 400,000 MMBtu/d at Topock effective December 1.  This is a 
huge benefit as we look for ways to maximize revenue for 2001.  
Congratulations to all the field operations personnel who contributed to 
resolving our contamination issues with PG&E on a timely basis while building 
an atmosphere of trust and credibility.  All the work is paying off.

Market spreads between production basins and the California border shot up 
this week then contracted by Thursday as weather fears and storage shortages 
across the US pushed prices up and down.  We successfully negotiated the 
following record-setting deals on TW:

 PG&E Trading - 30,000 MMBtu IT for 11/15 @ $0.90/MMBtu
 PG&E Trading - 30,000 MMBtu IT for 11/16 @ $.075/MMBtu
 Sempra             -  10,000 MMBtu LFT for December 1-31 @ $1.00/MMBtu

Transport Options - Our recent FERC filing is on the Commission's docket for 
next Tuesday November 21.  We expect the Commission to order a technical 
conference maybe before the end of the year.

NGPL - Producers behind Marathon's Indian Basin plant are trying to move 
additional volume to TW via the recently reactivated NGPL Winkler 
interconnect.  NGPL is evaluating cost options to add compression; this would 
also help us sell the point as a firm receipt point and extract more value.

I made the changes you asked for, plus a minor wording change in section 1 
about effective date.

This needs to be executed in duplicate originals, so print two.

If you have any questions, let me know!

 What are you doing on Labor Day? 
 
In between the hamburgers, hotdogs, homemade ice cream and occasional dip in 
the pool that many of you will undoubtedly be enjoying Monday, be sure to 
take a few minutes to turn your TV set to the Jerry Lewis Labor Day Muscular 
Dystrophy (MDA) Telethon on NBC.  At 1:10 p.m., Enron's own Linda Jenkins 
will present a $100,000 check to Jerry's Houston team.  The donation, which 
will benefit research for ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as 
Lou Gehrig's disease -- the disease Linda has been living with for the past 
three years), was raised by devoted friends and volunteers at the Enron/MDA 
Beach Bowl held in July.  

Thanks to all of you who raised money for this cause that is close to our 
hearts at Enron.   And have a happy and safe holiday.

Thanks for your suggestions.  I forgot about you leaving at 4:30.  By girls
have both those movies.  At age 2, my girls could not sit down long enough
to watch a movie.  They would watch a few minutes at a time of Barney.

Jim and I did see some movies lately:  Men of Honor with Cuba Wadding Jr
was a good tear jerker, Charlie's Angel was humorous because we weren't
expecting much, and Bedazzled brought us back down to earth.  I would
recommend all three!  Meghan got some DVD's and her two favorite that she

Hi Michelle,

How are you?  I was talking to Marilyn the other day.  We thought it would
be a good idea if we can try to get together one day.  Anyway, I haven't
asked you for movie suggestions since a long time.  I've seen "Perfect
Storm" and "The Patriot" .  Do you know of any others?  Or even if they are
still the theater ... I could add them to my future rental list.  Thanks.

Shippers Protest KMI's Order 637 Tariff Changes

Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission (KMI) has attempted an end run 
around FERC's Order 637,
filing wide-ranging operational and rate changes early under expedited tariff 
procedures to avoid the
more rigorous review in store for compliance filings, according to customer 
protests. 

Items in KMI's tariff filing fall into no less than 13 general categories, 
Indicated Shippers said. They include
imbalance provisions, storage balances, small customer service, gas quality, 
point allocations, curtailment 
priorities, right of first refusal, scheduling priorities, incidental 
purchase and sale, capacity release,
unauthorized gas, capacity rights overrun charge, and miscellaneous. 

Indicated Shippers called for summary rejection or maximum suspension of 
KMI's June 5 tariff filing (RP00-316), 
saying "most of the changes proposed in this case represent an effort by KMI 
to implement elements of 
Order 637 selectively and in a manner designed to minimize the opportunity 
for meaningful review and 
comment by KMI's customers." Only 12 days are allowed for intervention and 
comment on usually routine 
tariff filings, while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has allotted 
30 days for comments on 
Order 637 compliance filings. KMI was among the group of pipelines slated to 
make compliance filings June 15. 

KMI said its filing did not constitute its compliance filing, but was aimed 
at changing its tariff to reflect "the 
current natural gas business climate and evolving business practices.." It 
did acknowledge, "A number of the 
changes proposed herein are consistent with and advance the Commission's 
goals in Order No. 637." 

Indicated Shippers also protested changes that would make decisions regarding 
negative storage imbalances 
and end of season inventory swaps a matter of KMI's discretion without any 
standards on how those decisions 
would be made. The shippers also protested changes to the default methodology 
for point allocations for billing 
purposes, and the injection of KMI discretion into the formula for accepting 
or rejecting predetermined allocation 
agreements with upstream or downstream parties. In addition curtailment 
provisions filed by KMI appear to be 
contrary to Order 637-A's mandate that shippers moving gas within the primary 
path should have primary rights. 

The filing also would give the pipeline the opportunity to bottle up 
significant quantities of coal bed methane gas 
in Wyoming's Powder River Basin by imposing more rigorous standards on 
nitrogen content, according to 
Western Gas Resources. A key change would impose a nitrogen gas quality 
specification of 3% by volume. 
While KMI states the change is necessary to accommodate transfers with 
interconnecting pipelines, six of the 
seven connecting pipelines identified have no nitrogen specifications. Only 
KMI's affiliate, Natural Gas
Pipeline Co. of America, has similar rules, Western Gas said. 

"KMI's proposed nitrogen specification would enable KMI to refuse to accept 
coal bed methane production for 
transportation, thereby foreclosing the availability of one of the principal 
means of downstream pipeline egress 
out of Powder River production areas," Western Gas added. Producers would 
have to shut in production while 
they construct costly nitrogen facilities. This could "create at least a 
temporary gap in the downstream 
movement of coal bed supplies to mid-continent and eastern markets, thus 
frustrating consumer access to 
these significant supplies."

Runs of steel
Nebraska's option will blast through attacking defenses

Jul 12, 2000 10:12 p.m. ET
BY DARRYL RICHARDS
FOXSports.com

The first national champion of the millennium will not be the product of a
space-age spread offense inspired by a mad scientist who calls himself an
offensive coordinator.

The best college football team in America this season will run the most bas=
ic
of offenses. Call the option many things: plain, boring, ancient, uninspire=
d.
But when Nebraska runs it, it=01,s cruel and usual punishment for opposing
defenses.

Teams may be able to slow it down, but over the course of four quarters, th=
ey
will pay a price, slammed repeatedly by an offensive line that averages 303
pounds. Remember the limp noodles crawling out of Sun Devil Stadium in
January? That was Tennessee=01,s defense after the Cornhuskers drove 99 yar=
ds in
the fourth quarter of the Fiesta Bowl.

The beauty of the system is that it is the perfect offense for the current
rage of defenses using quick, blitzing attacks. Sure, you can send everybod=
y
after the ball, but the option demands you stop and think and play an
assignment. How do you properly scout a team that runs an offense you see
only once a year? The answer is you don=01,t.

Arguably, the Cornhuskers, FOXSports.com's No. 1 team in its preseason Top
25, were playing the best football in the country by the end of the 1999
season. In their last five games, the Cornhuskers beat Texas A&M, Kansas
State, Colorado, Texas and Tennessee by a cumulative score of 164-72. The
scary thing about Nebraska is that 10 offensive starters return for a team
that finished 12-1 last season.

The Cornhuskers have an unquenchable desire to be the best again. It starts
in the off-season and continues through January. The running game took a
while to materialize last season because of injuries, but I-back Dan
Alexander and quarterback Eric Crouch have the ability to rush for 1,000
yards this season. Even if the oft-injured Alexander can=01,t hold up to th=
e
pounding, the Cornhuskers have a replacement with great credentials and a
fitting name for this smashmouth football team: Thunder Collins.

Nebraska will not only push other teams around. The Cornhuskers will push
themselves. The school is touting guard Russ Hochstein and center Dominic
Raiola for the Outland Trophy, presented to the nation's outstanding interi=
or
lineman. The beneficiary of this internal competition is the offense.

"This group has a great deal of confidence that always shows come August an=
d
September," said Nebraska coach Frank Solich, who has his best team since
taking over for Tom Osborne three years ago. "We have a rich history and a
team coming off a good season that is not questioning things.

"We have high expectations. Some of it comes from how we finished last
season. A lot comes from playing in an excellent program and tradition."

The option and the 'Huskers are inextricably bound. It is their offense, an=
d
they have been running it so long it is practically an open-book test for
defensive coordinators. Yet, only eight teams have passed the test over the
last seven years. Nebraska has won 81 games and three national titles in th=
at
span.

"We try to keep up with what=01,s current and we use the spring to experime=
nt,"
Solich said. "But our players and coaches like to line up and beat you. Our
players that are here love it. It is an aggressive style of play and that=
=01,s
how they want to play it. It=01,s what our players want to do on offense."

The Cornhuskers will not go through the season unchallenged. Crouch can put
his name up there with the Turner Gill, Tommie Frazier and Scott Frost for
the title of best Nebraska quarterback ever, but all bets are off for this
team if Crouch is hurt, because the Cornhuskers lack depth at quarterback.

The schedule has its pitfalls too. Notre Dame, looking for a win that can
restore luster and a reason to keep coach Bob Davie, gets Nebraska at home =
on
Sept. 9. A resurgent Oklahoma team and top rival Kansas State get Nebraska =
at
their places. Kansas State won the last time the teams met in Manhattan.

The Cornhuskers will probably play Texas or Oklahoma in the Big 12
championship game, which has had a tendency to produce a surprise finish.

The Cornhuskers also must shore up a secondary that loses Ralph and Mike
Brown. But Nebraska Carlos Polk back as the heart of the defense. Polk is
heralded by Nebraska insiders as the best linebacker in school history.

But come January 3, Nebraska will play Florida State for the national title=
.
And the Seminoles too will fall under the relentless attack.

High Prices Put a Damper on Industrial Demand

     Gas producers must be wringing their hands in glee as futures prices top 
$4.45/MMBtu, but some of their customers
     clearly are a little less than overjoyed. High gas prices are forcing 
some fertilizer producers to consider shutting down
     their plants and selling their feedstock on the open market just to make 
ends meet. 

     WEFA Inc. energy analyst Ron Denhardt estimates the gas industry will 
lose 25% (400 MMcf/d) of demand from the
     ammonia and urea industry this year because of the high price of natural 
gas. Other observers are expecting much larger
     losses, reaching as high as 1.5 Bcf/d. Denhardt also estimates the loss 
of an additional 1-2 Bcf/d due to fuel switching in
     the power production sector and possibly another 2.2 Bcf/d as industrial 
end users switch over to fuel oil. But those
     numbers are dependent on the comparative price of Nos. 1 and 2 fuel oil, 
both of which currently exceed the price of
     natural gas per Btu. 

     "Chemical and fertilizer companies who have hedged their gas supplies 
are better off shutting down their plants right now
     and selling the gas into the market," said one chemical plant supply 
manager, who asked to remain anonymous. "It's
     terrible. It's awful. About 70% of my contracts for sale are 
pass-through based on the cost of raw materials, and that's
     the only thing that is keeping me in business right now. We would not be 
making cost right now otherwise. We might be
     at a break-even point. And we hedged about 40% of our purchases back in 
September of last year, which was a pretty
     good time, looking back right now. We just have to plan it day by day. A 
number of fertilizer companies have closed
     up." 

     It's difficult to say when it becomes uneconomic to produce fertilizer 
because each plant is unique with its specific
     depreciation rate and costs, noted Dennis Lee, manager of energy and 
feedstock for Sask Ferco Products Inc., a
     partnership of Cargil and the Saskatchewan government. Lee's plant is 
one of the largest ammonia and urea producers in
     the world. It uses about 75 MMcf/d. Regardless of the unique 
circumstances of each plant, however, it's clear most of
     the companies will have to put out a lot of cash in the next few months 
to stay producing, said Lee. "From a credit
     perspective, some of the weaker companies may be in a credit crunch. 
There have been a couple of announcements of
     prolonged shut-downs in the Gulf Coast region recently because of high 
gas prices. 

     "People are getting antsy" because of a potential fertilizer shortage in 
the fall, he said. "Overall, I don't think it's a very
     healthy time for our industry. There could be some restructuring because 
of it." 

     He said it "doesn't look like" his plant is in any danger of a shut-down 
"at this point" because it is very close to its
     customer base in the Midwest and has a high efficiency factor, much 
higher than its older competitors in the Gulf Coast
     and Midcontinent regions. But the outlook does not look as good for many 
of his competitors, he said. 

     Procter & Gamble recently turned to energy procurement over the Internet 
in an attempt achieve greater purchasing
     efficiency and lower prices. It is posting requests for quotes (RFQ) for 
a number of its facilities on a new transaction
     website, www.energygateway.com, as part of its exploration of new 
avenues for supply acquisition. "We're in the early
     stages of experimenting with this," a P&G buyer said. (See Daily GPI, 
June 13) P&G, which like most very large energy
     using manufacturers, continues to do its buying and risk management 
in-house, plans to post more RFQs on the
     energygateway.com website. 

     "We're looking for other opportunities to try out and evaluate. We're 
always looking for ways to bring value to our
     company," the P&G buyer said. "It's not a good time to be a buyer in the 
energy market. We're re-evaluating our
     approaches. We don't want to just be a victim of the market."

El Paso declared an Unauthorized Overpull Penalty situation Thursday that 
will remain in effect until further notice. The pipeline said it will limit 
scheduled volumes at underperforming interconnects to insure system 
integrity. 

Likely in response to the A/BC border constraint that began Thursday due to 
maintenance on the TransCanada-British Columbia Line, NOVA changed its 
imbalance tolerance range to +2%/-18% Wednesday. Reflecting the resultant 
shift in supply accessibility, neighboring Westcoast has a +20%/0% tolerance 
in effect.

TO: Houston Area Employees Participating in the Domestic Medical Plan Benefits

You may have recently received communication from United HealthCare (UHC) 
concerning Memorial Hermann Health Systems' (MHHS) decision to terminate 
their contract with UHC  in the Houston/Beaumont area.  This communication 
also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network 
due to this action.  It is our intent to help you understand the situation.

It is our understanding that Memorial Herman Health Systems asked for a 40% 
increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to 
you and Enron!  When United HealthCare attempted to negotiate with a counter 
proposal, Memorial Hermann cancelled their contract.

While this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and UHC, 
Enron continues to support UHC in their ongoing contract negotiation 
efforts.  At this time, it is only UHC which has been affected, however, it 
is our understanding that Cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group 
and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well.  

Many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals 
within the UHC Network or have contracted directly with UHC including those 
with admission privileges to The Woodlands, Sugarland and Clear Lake 
Hospitals, to name a few.  In a further effort to limit disruption to our 
affected employees and families who are enrolled in the UHC Network or EPO 
options, Enron has authorized UHC to process claims incurred between 
September 28 and December 31, 2000 as if the termination of the Memorial 
Hermann Health Systems from the network had not occurred and In-Network 
benefits applied.  Office visits will have a $10 copayment and all other 
charges will be covered at 90%.  Hospital admissions will still need to be 
pre-certified with UHC.

These steps have decreased the number of participants' affected by Primary 
Care Physician disruption from 1,050 to 127.

If You Need Medical Attention:  You or your doctor/hospital must call UHC's 
customer service number so proper benefits can be verified.  In some cases 
the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed.

Over the last few months, we have been discussing our standard E-mail=20
platform with you, our customer.  Your feedback from the various=20
demonstrations, surveys and Technology Showcases validated that E-mail is a=

Therefore, to meet the demands of our fast-paced business, Enron Net Works =
is=20
standardizing our E-mail platform by deploying Microsoft Outlook 2000 to al=

Why are we switching to Outlook 2000?
Outlook 2000 integrates more effectively with our new operating system,=20
Windows 2000, and the Microsoft products that Enron currently uses. With=20
Outlook 2000, we can provide you with a more robust mail platform including=

I just received a call from Nancy Bagot informing me that FERC has issued a 
draft order suspending our proposed Transport Options tariff sheets until May 
1, 2001 and accepting them subject to the outcome of a technical conference.  
The technical conference is to take place within 120 days of the order and 
will address issues raised in protests.
I should be receiving a copy of the draft order soon.  Please call or e-mail 
me if you have questions.

In an effort to bring incremental revenue for our pipeline, I researched 
outstanding invoices generated from facility interconnects, etc.  
Transwestern currently has no outstanding dollars to collect.  However, there 
appears to be $600,000 that can be collected on Northern Natural in addition 
to $250,000 that was written off.  Attached are the spreadsheets from 
Accounts Receivable.

News : FERC Approves Independence, SupplyLink Projects 
2:00 PM (CST) Jul 12, 2000
 
After submitting proof of market need in the form of newly signed precedent 
agreements 
for firm transportation capacity, the highly contested Independence Pipeline 
and related 
SupplyLink pipeline projects were approved by FERC this morning. The two 
projects 
have been pending at FERC for more than three years.

The FERC decision paves the way for more than 900 MMcf/d of new natural gas 
transportation capacity to be built between Chicago and the Leidy Hub in 
Pennsylvania. 
The "tentative" in-service date for the projects is November 2002. Their 
downstream 
partner, MarketLink, which was approved by FERC in April, is expected to be 
operating 
a year earlier, a Williams Cos. spokesman said.  Williams, Coastal, and 
National 
Fuel are sponsoring the three pipeline projects, which together represent an 
investment 
of about $1.5 billion.

The Commission approved the "greenfield" Independence project over 
significant 
opposition from landowners in Ohio and Pennsylvania, who recently said they 
were not 
convinced the new precedent agreements provided "sufficient evidence" of 
market 
support .  The agreements met FERC's requirement for the projects to have at 
least 35% 
of their total capacity subscribed by non-affiliates by June 26.

Unocal will announce higher that anticipated 3rd quarter earnings on 10/25.  
They also did not hedge their production, so are able to capture the higher

TW and Caithness met in Denver this week for the first face-to-face meeting 
between the parties.  The purpose of the meeting was to review the status of 
the Caithness Big Sandy Project and to establish the next steps for moving 
the project forward.

Caithness Corporation
Caithness Corp. is a privately held company based in New York with a variety 
of business interests.  The company is essentially a financial vehicle for 
private investors.  Their energy segment currently owns 1,200 MW of 
generation through renewable assets in California (geothermal at Coso, wind 
in Tehachapi and Palm Springs) and a gas fired plant in South Carolina 
jointly-owned by Florida Power & Light.

Big Sandy Project
The Big Sandy Project is a proposed power plant to be located near Wickieup, 
Arizona.  The project would be built in two phases- first phase would be 550 
MW, with a gas load of approx. 80,000 MMBtu/d, and phase 2 would add another 
170 MW for a total of 720 MW with a gas load of 120,000 MMBtu/d.

The proposed location of the plant is approximately 40 miles south of 
Transwestern's pipeline.  The take-off point on Transwestern would be at/near 
valve station #1008, approximately 15 miles downstream of compressor Station 
#1.  The current estimate includes an alignment that follows Arizona state 
highway 93 south to a location 2 miles southeast of Wickieup in the S/W 4 of 
Section 5, T15N, R12W, Mohave County, Arizona.  There is a 500 KV 
transmission line owned by WAPA that crosses the property.  This line is one 
of the principal electric transmission systems in the Southwest and extends 
from the Phoenix area to the Mead substation near Boulder City, NV.  I've 
included a WAPA map below which indicates this line.  Also, on the site is a 
water pipeline owned by the Cyprus Amax Bagdad mine.  Water for the plant 
will come from an encapusulated water table through deep wells.  They have 
currently dug the first two test wells, each capable of 500 cfm.  The power 
plant will require approximately 3,500 cfm of water.  In addition to the 
wells, the plant has several thousand-acre feet of water rights to surface 
water from the Big Sandy River.  The project may also purchase water from the 
Cyprus Bagdad water pipeline.

The chief geological feature of this area is the Big Sandy River and 
associated wash.  The highway 93 roadbed follows along the river.  The area 
includes rolling hills and is principally desert terrain, with some limited 
agricultural and ranching interests.  Wickieup is a very small town with an 
estimated population of 200.

Project Schedule
Gas Turbine(s) ordered Westinghouse-Seimens  May 2000
Submit Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)  August 2000
Arrange financing     December 2000
EIS approval      March 2001
Construction begins     April 2001
Testing begins      July 2002
Commercial Operation     November 2002

There are two lead agencies for purposes of the project's EIS- the Bureau of 
Land Management (BLM Kingman office) and the Western Area Power 
Administration (WAPA).  There is only one endangered/threatened species known 
to be present in the area.

Lateral Pipeline Alignment
The most critical path item is the alignment of the lateral pipeline.  The 
alignment (lateral pipeline route) must be included in the EIS to be filed 
next month.  Caithness has spoken preliminarily with the Arizona Department 
of Transportation (ADOT) and the agency is amenable to granting an easement 
for the pipeline.  The problem appears to be in the limited amount of right 
of way available.  Measured from the shoulder to the fenceline, there is only 
a 70 ft. right of way available for construction.  Typically, pipelines 
require a 100 ft. temporary construction easement and 50 ft. of permanent 
right of way.  Preliminary discussions indicate another problem with this 
alignment may be the roadway's routing within the wash of the riverbed.

If the highway 93 corridor is unsuitable for the pipeline, the second 
alternative appears to be running the pipeline down the adjacent N/S section 
line.  The problem with this approach is that as the line nears the site, the 
routing would have to contend with the river bed and wash areas, possibly 
necessitating deep burial and anchoring.  The other route would involve 
following along the WAPA electric transmission corridor.  The only issue 
there, aside from whether WAPA would permit the pipeline encroachment, is 
whether there are safety and/or corrosion concerns associated with a high 
pressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission system.

Other Preliminary Project Issues
There are other fundamental issues to address.  The original concept was to 
interconnect the proposed Transwestern lateral with El Paso's northern 
mainline and the yet-to-be-constructed Questar Southern Trails Pipeline, both 
of which lay adjacent to Transwestern's mainline.  Transwestern's original 
estimate to construct a 16" lateral pipeline and meter station ($20.3MM) was 
based on the following specifications:

120 MMcf/d
450 psig delivery pressure,
900 psig inlet pressure

The meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a 
higher 550 psig minimum delivery pressure (new technology Westinghouse 
turbines).  In addition, our understanding is that EPNG's system operates at 
a pressure 100-150 psig lower than Transwestern's.  In order to accommodate 
EPNG deliveries and to account for the new higher minimum pressure, the 
design will likely change to a 20" pipeline.

Transportation Notes

El Paso Natural Gas issued an emergency notice Monday, reporting that the 
Bondad 2A turbine must be taken down to repair an oil leak today. The work 
will reduce the capacity of the station by 95 MMcf/d. El Paso also said Line 
1200 and 1201 are being "Smart Pigged" this week on Sept. 19, 21 and 24, 
causing a reduction of 40 MMcf/d of San Juan Basin capacity. If you have

Title: The West: Keeping Its Fingers Crossed
Author: Zenker, Moritzburke, Snyder
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: Western Energy ,
URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1286 ,

A strong dose of summer weather in June propelled West-wide demand levels up 
by nearly 12 percent over the same period in 1999. These higher demand levels 
provided the year's first example of the power price spikes that can be 
produced when the West's tight capacity intersects with normal summer load 
levels, lower-than-normal hydroelectric levels, strong gas prices, and 
California's immature wholesale power market structure. As power markets 
reacted in June with unprecedented price strength throughout the region, 
regulators and the California Independent System Operator (ISO) intervened to 
dampen markets from a maximum of $750 per megawatt-hour (MWh) to $500 per 
MWh.* Although some market participants have filed protests at the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission to raise or eliminate the caps, utilities, 
legislators, and consumer advocates are moving to protect consumers or 
completely redesign what they perceive as a flawed market.

As western markets move through the critical July-August peak electricity 
demand period, market participants and regulators alike are wondering if 
power supplies will be sufficient and if price levels will rival those in 
June. CERA expects that western supplies will be adequate under normal summer 
weather conditions, barring abnormal unit and transmission line outages. 
However, normal August weather conditions will push demand levels 
significantly higher than in June, creating an even tighter supply-demand 
balance, straining the ability of the transmission system to supply key 
demand regions adequately. A hot weather event could exhaust both in-state 
and imported supplies for California.

The tight supply and demand situation will almost certainly prompt a strong 
price response, similar to that in June. This will fuel the unease of 
regulators in states that have restructured their markets and in those that 
are considering restructuring. Even as regulators' continued support of 
restructured power markets begins to waver, a weather event that forces 
regional blackouts would force regulators to intervene.

CERA's outlook for August power markets is driven by
* High peak loads. Under normal weather conditions, West-wide August loads 
will be on average 1,400 megawatts (MW) higher than last August. The peak 
load in California is expected to push capacity margins to 6 percent, even 
after curtailing interruptible load.

* Lower hydroelectric output. As the West enters its peak load period, 
hydroelectric production is expected to decline systemwide by roughly 3,900 
average megawatts (aMW) from July to August. Compared with the high, 
sustained output of last August, hydroelectric output this August, although 
roughly average on a historical basis, will be roughly 4,900 aMW (20 percent) 
lower.

* High levels of gas-fired generation. Compared with August 1999, higher 
utilization rates, along with gas prices that have climbed $1.88 per million 
British thermal units (MMBtu), will increase the incremental cost of energy 
production by over $20 per MWh. Although CERA expects power prices in August 
to diverge from production costs owing to the expected supply tightness, 
higher production costs will create a higher floor for energy prices in all 
periods of the day.

The extremely tight power supply-demand balance within the West, and within 
California specifically, has resulted in unprecedented high summer gas demand 
for power generation. This high demand level-combined with seasonal storage 
injection needs in California-has pushed up utilization rates on pipelines 
into California and pushed Topock differentials over $0.75 per MMBtu to the 
Henry Hub. Strong demand should continue through August in the West and 
support premium pricing at Topock.

The Rocky Mountains represent the opposite extreme to the high premium placed 
on Topock deliveries. In the Rockies supply is building relative to export 
pipeline capacity, and market access is becoming a challenge. Weak seasonal 
demand compounds the problem; the strong western demand for gas for power 
generation does not extend to the Rockies. Generation within the region 
remains nearly all coal-fired. These regional pressures should remain a 
feature of western gas markets through September.

Moderate summer weather and reassuring injection rates nationwide during 
recent weeks have allowed some easing in prices at the Henry Hub. However, 
summer is not yet over and absolute storage inventories are still at critical 
levels. Higher gas prices are likely to resurface.

Regional Power Market Drivers
August demand under normal weather is expected to rise by an additional 7 
percent, or nearly 5,500 aMW, over average June levels (see Table 1). Peak 
demand levels should exceed those in June as well, with a coincident peak 
over the whole Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) of 118,600 MW 
expected under normal weather conditions in 2000, a 2.7 percent increase over 
the weather-muted 1999 peak. California alone should experience peak loads 
that are approximately 3,600 MW higher than peak levels in June.

Available generation capacity in the West has been at normal levels for this 
time of year, although coal-fired plants are responding to a record 
production year with repeated but short-lived outages. The steady decline in 
hydroelectric generation will remove 3,900 aMW from the West resource base 
when compared with July levels and about 6,800 aMW since June, although 
reservoir refilling operations temporarily removed significant quantities of 
hydroelectric generation during portions of June. Given hydro operators' 
economic interest in maximizing on-peak production at the expense of off-peak 
production, the loss of capacity during the on-peak period will be lower than 
these levels.

August will be a critical month for the heavily import-dependent state of 
California. While the state will be drawing approximately 7,000 aMW of 
imports during August to meet demands during peak periods, CERA expects the 
level of imports to exceed 8,200 MW during peak demand conditions. The 
Southwest's need to supply native demand first will limit its ability to 
export to California, and lower year-over-year hydroelectric production in 
the Pacific Northwest will limit exports from that region.

Pacific Northwest
CERA expects Pacific Northwest demand in August to climb by nearly 1,300 aMW 
when compared with June levels. The water supply for the Pacific Northwest 
has declined to 91 percent of normal levels for the Lower Columbia owing to 
warmer-than-normal weather in June. In addition, normal seasonal decline in 
runoff levels will drop about 6,000 aMW from the resource base when compared 
with levels in June (see Table 2). Generation plant operators have responded 
to both growing native demand and a robust export market by running coal and 
gas-fired generation at high levels. Although less than 4,000 MW of gas-fired 
generation is currently available in the region, it has been running at high 
utilization rates.

High energy demand in California for Pacific Northwest energy will keep 
differentials low between the regions. As in June, Pacific Northwest prices 
will respond in kind to the volatility CERA expects to occur in California in 
August. In addition, if hot weather in the Pacific Northwest pressures 
regional energy reserves, local prices will rise to keep energy in the 
region, potentially causing prices in the Pacific Northwest to move higher 
than those to the south.

California
California is entering the peak load season with relatively little generating 
capacity down for maintenance. Although hydroelectric output continues to 
decline, statewide reservoir storage levels remain high at roughly 118 
percent of normal. Nevertheless, declining hydroelectric production is 
expected to remove about 730 aMW when compared with hydroelectric production 
levels in June.

Normal summer weather will push demand in the state up by about 3,600 aMW 
over June levels, which were high (see Table 3). California's peak load is 
expected to exceed 57,000 MW, compared with a peak load in June of 
approximately 53,500 MW (43,447 MW on the state's ISO system alone, according 
to its own estimate). Assuming normal plant outage rates, this demand level 
will necessitate the import of about 8,200 MW of energy to meet the statewide 
peak. Even after curtailing the approximately 2,800 MW of interruptible load 
available for tight supply situations, the state has a precarious 6 percent 
capacity margin during the system peak. An extreme hot weather event could 
push state loads up by an additional 3,000 MW. Outages are likely if 
additional imports are not available.

A capacity limit of 4,600 MW will be in place during the summer for energy 
exports from the Pacific Northwest to Northern California. The import limit 
from the Pacific Northwest to southern California will be 3,100 MW.

Rockies and Southwest
August demand levels in the combined Rockies/Southwest region will increase 
only slightly above levels in August 1999, climbing approximately 275 aMW, as 
loads in the region-unlike the rest of the below-average WSCC-were near 
normal last August. Even so, August loads will increase demand by over 1,250 
aMW when compared with levels in June of this year. As with last year and 
this June, supplies in the region should be sufficient to meet peak demand 
conditions under normal weather, although growing loads in the 
Rockies/Southwest region have reduced its ability to supply neighboring 
regions with energy during peak demand conditions.

High loads driven by hot weather will keep the region's prices high. 
Differentials between the region and California will be tight, but 
California, having tighter supply-demand balances, will need to price at a 
premium to attract energy. The high-capacity transmission ties between the 
Rockies/Southwest and the California market, which is about 150 percent the 
size of the Rockies/Southwest market, will ensure that prices in the 
Rockies/Southwest stay close behind California prices whenever loads are high 
in California.

Regional Gas Market Drivers
Evidence of pipeline bottlenecks has emerged across the West, and supply and 
demand forces over the next year look likely to intensify these pressures. 
Since the Northern Border expansion in late 1998, narrow north-south and 
east-west differentials across pricing points defined the market. This 
summer, the continuing supply growth in the Rocky Mountains has widened 
differentials between the Rockies and the rest of the West. At Topock, 
increasing gas demand in California and high utilization rates have resulted 
in high premiums.

Overall in North American gas markets, strong storage injection rates in 
recent weeks have allowed some easing in prices-from an early July Henry Hub 
price of $4.50 per MMBtu to under $4.00 per MMBtu. However, despite these 
high injection rates, the supply-demand balance and absolute level of storage 
inventories remain precarious. Summer is not over and higher nationwide power 
loads in weeks to come will likely cut into storage injections and boost 
prices. The ongoing competition between power and storage for supply should 
support an average Henry Hub price of $4.20 per MMBtu in August.

Through the end of the summer, differentials in the West should hold near 
current levels. The pressure of growing Rocky Mountain supply will continue 
until heating loads start climbing in the fall. In California high seasonal 
power loads should continue through August with hot weather and continued 
declines in hydroelectric generation. Demand strength is expected to 
continue. Across the West, August demand for gas should climb from 9.8 
billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day in June to 10.4 Bcf per day, buoyed by an 
increase in gas demand for power generation (see Table 4).

California
High gas demand for power generation within California will continue through 
August. CERA expects an increase from the state's June demand levels of 5.6 
Bcf per day to 6.2 Bcf per day during August. The increase stems from 
declines in hydroelectric generation and increases in overall power loads. 
Total demand is expected to exceed last year's demand level by 1.2 Bcf per 
day. This will increase flows on pipelines into California, reduce the 
state's storage surplus, and sustain high prices. CERA expects pipeline 
utilization rates during August to average 95 percent (see Table 5). CERA 
expects an August Topock-Henry Hub differential of $0.45 per MMBtu (see Table 
6).

Pacific Northwest
Despite the extremely high prices at Topock and high demand in California, 
until recently gas at Malin priced at a slight discount to Henry Hub prices. 
After averaging $0.17 per MMBtu below the Henry Hub during the third quarter 
last year, the differential so far during the third quarter this year is 
$0.15 per MMBtu below the Hub. This week Malin is pricing at a $0.25 per 
MMBtu premium relative to the Henry Hub. The Topock-Malin differential has 
swelled to over $0.60 per MMBtu, signaling intra-California pipeline capacity 
constraints. Two factors pressured Malin differentials during the early 
summer.
* Pressure on Rocky Mountain and AECO differentials. Prices in the two areas 
supplying the Pacific Northwest are under some pressure. Increasing supplies 
in the Rockies are beginning to reach the limits of export capacity and put 
downward pressure on Rockies prices by limiting external market access. At 
AECO, although export capacity out of the province is available, almost all 
of that excess capacity accesses eastern Canada on TransCanada Pipeline. 
Pipelines into the United States are running near capacity. Because of 
TransCanada's limited ability to discount interruptible transport, the 
available space is more expensive and therefore the last to be filled.

* Low early summer regional demand. Gas demand in the Pacific Northwest is 
limited during late spring and early summer by declines in heating loads and 
very strong hydroelectric output. Even in a normal or dry hydroelectric year, 
seasonal runoff holds down gas demand for power generation in May and June 
even as gas demand for power generation begins climbing in California. 
Increasing power loads are already evident.

The first factor will likely endure until heating season begins in late fall 
and regional demand in the Rockies and western Canada begins climbing. 
However, gas demand for power generation in the Pacific Northwest has 
increased already this summer and will continue to climb through the end of 
July and into August as hydroelectric generation wanes. This added demand-200 
million cubic feet (MMcf) per day above June demand levels-will provide some 
support for Malin prices and limited support for Rockies and AECO prices. 
Malin-Henry Hub differentials are expected to average $0.05 per MMBtu above 
the Henry Hub price during August.

Rocky Mountains
Pressure on regional supplies within the Rockies continues as exports out of 
the region reach new highs. Differentials to the Henry Hub have widened to 
over $0.70 per MMBtu and although prices in the rest of the West will gain 
some support from high power loads, regional demand in the Rockies is 
expected to remain near low seasonal levels through August. August demand is 
expected to average 1.2 Bcf per day in the region, approximately equal to 
June's 1.1 Bcf per day total demand. Demand begins to build during September, 
but until the heating season begins in October, Rocky Mountain prices will 
lag well below prices in the rest of the West. CERA expects a Rocky 
Mountain-Henry Hub differential of $0.60 per MMBtu during August.

Although some narrowing in Rocky Mountain differentials looks likely as 
seasonal demand increases through the fall, the rapid build in supply in the 
region will likely keep differentials wide during 2001. CERA expects a supply 
build this year of nearly 300 MMcf per day, followed by a build of over 350 
MMcf per day during 2001. Currently, approximately 300 MMcf per day of excess 
pipeline export exists out of the region, with the largest increment on 
Transcolorado into the San Juan Basin. Next summer, all capacity will likely 
run close to full. Until export pipelines expand-the first likely expansion 
is Trailblazer-differentials will remain wide. For 2001, CERA expects an 
average annual differential below the Henry Hub of $0.65 per MMBtu.

Southwest
Differentials in the San Juan and Permian Basins have gained considerable 
strength relative to Henry Hub prices amid the recent hot weather in Texas. 
Permian supplies are pricing at a slight premium to the Henry Hub price, and 
in the San Juan Basin prices have narrowed from an early July differential of 
$0.35 per MMBtu to a differential of less than $0.20 per MMBtu. CERA expects 
demand in the Southwest during August of 1.4 Bcf per day, an increase from 
June's level of 1.3 Bcf per day, but the larger Texas market will determine 
the relative strength of differentials in those two basins. CERA expects a 
San Juan differential of $0.30 per MMBtu during August, with a Permian Basin 
differential of $0.06 per MMBtu.

Differentials between the Rocky Mountains and the San Juan Basin have widened 
substantially over the past two months with supply increases in the Rocky 
Mountains. Flows on Transcolorado increased from a monthly average of under 
20 MMcf per day to over 100 MMcf per day during June. Supply in the two 
regions is following opposite paths; Rockies supply is climbing rapidly, and 
San Juan supply has likely peaked and should decline slowly beginning this 
year. CERA expects a decline in supply of 30 MMcf per day during 2000 
relative to 1999 and an additional decline of 150 MMcf per day during 2001. 
Because of these different outlooks, wider Rockies-San Juan differentials 
will persist.

Attached is the proposed contract with Oneok.  Since it is a maximum rate 
deal, there is no discount letter.  However, I am circulating this for 
approval because it contains a special provision (found in the "Other" 
section) regarding marketing of capacity for release, as allowed by Section 
30.8 of the General Terms and Conditions of Transwestern's tariff.

Christine, you and Michele will need to fill in the address and account 
information.  My sincerest apologies for operating outside the usual 
contracting procedure but since time is even more of the essence that usual 
here, I felt it was best to get a pro forma version of this out for approval 
as soon as possible.

Please e-mail your approval to Christine and me by noon tomorrow if 
possible.  Thank you.

Subject: RSVP: August 25 - Introduction to the Electric Industry


By now I'm sure that you've heard about the upcoming electric industry class 
that has been customized for GPG staff.   The purpose of the class is to 
learn about electric utilities as our customers, learn about some of the 
current regulatory and legislative debates and the impact on us, and to learn 
about the economics of electric generation.   

The class will be held on August 25 at the Downtown Houston Doubletree Hotel, 
Granger Rooms A & B  from 8-5 PM.  Stan Horton will open the class with 
remarks on why he believes GPG needs to learns about economics and trends in 
the electric industry.  The class includes a full day of course work and a 
working lunch will be served.   A  workbook is being prepared and will be 
distributed to you a week prior to the class.  

I hope you can attend.  Similar industry classes can cost upwards of $600 per 
student.   Our customized class can accommodate up to 100 attendees.   Please 
RSVP to Ruth Mann by email by August 8 if you plan to attend.  Once I get a 
count of attendees from this list, I will open the class up to other GPG 
attendees.

El Paso South System Flows 700 MMcf/d

Less than two weeks after the deadly explosion on El Paso Natural Gas' system 
in southeastern New Mexico, the pipeline last week had more than 700 MMcf/d 
of its 1.1 Bcf/d capacity restored to its South Mainline that services 
markets between Texas and California. 

At mid-day Friday, El Paso said it began running about 260 MMcf/d through 
Line 1100 after it received the go-ahead from the federal Office of Pipeline 
Safety (OPS), according to spokeswoman Kim Wallace. El Paso was able to 
re-start partial service on the 26-inch line after it built a 16-inch 
temporary connector line between Line 1110 and Line 1100, which was approved 
by OPS. 

The temporary connector was installed just east of the Pecos River explosion 
site, about 30 miles from Carlsbad, NM. Wallace said Line 1100 would carry 
the gas from Eunice, NM, just Northeast of the Pecos River Compressor 
Station, to the connector with Line 1110, which then would transport it 
westward across the Pecos River Bridge where it would meet up with Line 1100 
further downstream. Meanwhile, Wallace said El Paso submitted to OPS last 
week the test results and a preliminary return-to-service plan for Line 1100. 

Three days prior, the OPS had given El Paso permission to restore service to 
Line 1110 from the Keystone Station through the Pecos River Compressor 
Station at a reduced level. The pipeline re-opened the line at about 400 
MMcf/d, and gradually increased it to 480 MMcf/d by Friday. This is "still 
within the limits it [OPS] set" for Line 1110, Wallace said. 

The OPS restricted El Paso's Line 1110 to 80% of the operating pressure of 
Line 1103 at the time it ruptured, according to Department of Transportation 
spokeswoman Debbie Hinz. She said this put the line at a pressure of about 
538 pounds per square inch. 

The OPS-ordered shutdown of Line 1110 lasted 10 days, during which the agency 
ordered El Paso to conduct extensive hydrostatic, ultrasound and X-ray tests 
to determine its safety, and to submit a plan for restoring service to the 
line. 

As for the future of ruptured Line 1103, Wallace said repairs on it would not 
begin until after the investigation of the explosion is completed, which will 
"probably be nine to 12 months." 

The restoration of service couldn't come soon enough for El Paso customers 
who have been scrambling for transportation capacity ever since federal 
investigators and regulators closed down the three lines that make up El 
Paso's South Main leg in the wake of the blast that killed 11 people and 
critically injured one. California customers have been taking gas out of 
storage to meet their needs during the service interruption. The Department 
of Energy has set up a task force to evaluate the effects of the explosion 
and shutdown on the gas market.

After having conducted our first of several business reviews, Enron Global 
Markets - Office of the Chairman would like to outline the following 
organizational changes effective immediately.

The Global Risk Markets group under Jere Overdyke illustrates enormous 
opportunities given the size of those businesses.  To better focus on the 
different commercial functions and to capture market share and value, the 
group is being realigned.  Jere will continue to manage Global Risk Markets 
and build on our insurance capabilities.  Mark Tawney is responsible for our 
weather business and will now report to the EGM Office of the Chairman.  

Brent Price will be joining Enron Global Markets as Vice President of 
Operations and Chief Accounting Officer.  He will report to the EGM Office of 
the Chairman, and to Sally Beck, Vice President of Global Risk Management 
Operations.  In his role as Chief Accounting Officer, Brent will also report 
to Rick Causey, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for 
Enron Corp.  Reporting to Brent in his new position will be Sheila Glover, 
business controller for Financial Products; Todd Hall, business controller 
for weather; and Scott Earnest, business controller for global products and 
coal.  In addition, Tom Myers will join Brent's management team as Director 
of Accounting.  Brent and his team are responsible for all accounting, risk 
reporting and trading operations for all the businesses within EGM. 

Cindy Skinner will join the Enron Global Markets team with responsibility for 
Human Resources.  She will also report to David Oxley and the HR organization.
 
Please join us in congratulating everyone in their assignments.

Could you replace our recent posting on the EBB with the attached document.  
We've just corrected the name of "Enron Oil & Gas" to "EOG Resources".  I 
don't think it's necessary to put "Revised" or anything on it, unless we have 
to.  I'd just like to replace it (or if you can go in and make that change, 
that's okay too).  Let me know.

Thanks,
Lindy

Jeff:

You asked how your Gross Margin % could be higher in 2000 but your overall 
Gross Margin be lower. 

You appear to have lower invoiced volumes in Jan-April 2000.  

January and Feb. -for example:






Great question!

WESTERN ENERGY MONTHLY BRIEFING:
PRICES REMAIN HIGH AND VOLATILE
Winter arrived with a bang last week, and the wild ride
in western gas and power markets continues. The early
cold together with maintenance outages on pipelines and
power plants, strong pulls on gas, and low storage
inventories pushed gas prices to new highs.

* Topock prices pushed over $10.00 per million British
thermal units (MMBtu) in mid-November, with Sumas and
Malin hitting $8.00. These price run-ups are likely to
continue.

* The pipeline-constrained Topock and Malin markets will
see swings from $6.00 to $12.00 per MMBtu on a week-to-
week-basis.

* November's cold snap demonstrated what CERA has
anticipated: continued power price strength and
volatility during the year due to gas and power market
supply tightness.

Transport Options - In response to our recent FERC filing, a technical 
conference has been scheduled in Washington D.C. for January 9, 2001.  

Fuel Hedge - With gas prices running at record highs, we hedged 5,000 MMBtu/d 
of fuel for calendar 2002 at $4.50, then unwound it the following day as the 
market dipped allowing us to book a small gain in excess of $100,000.  We 
expect prices to jump again next week with the oncoming cold snap and we'll 
likely reset the hedge at higher numbers.

PNM - TW's response to PNM's request for transport proposal went out this 
week.  They are paying max rates on an East to East contract and indicated to 
us they feel the rates are not currently supported by the market.; TW however 
disagrees.  Our response to them leaves the current rate structure in place 
but has two additional tiers of volumetric incentive pricing.  As their 
volume increases, their rates go down.  In addition, we added a seasonal IT 
rate to the proposal that helps them meet any swing gas demand requirements.

Albuquerque Lateral - ENA is meeting with IPP plant owners in the Albuquerque 
region who would like to see alternative sources of gas supply besides the 
local utility.  If the operators expand the plant from a peaking unit to a 
combined-cycle unit, there is potentially enough load to justify a new 
delivery lateral off TW's mainline.  Part of the deal structure may include a 
volume incentive rate as throughput increases in the lateral.  Next step for 
TW is to build a rate matrix under several different operating scenarios.  
Responses are due to ENA by Friday 12/15.

Black Mesa Project - We continue to evaluate the potential of converting the 
Black Mesa coal slurry line owned by Northern Border into gas service.  The 
big advantage for TW is it will increase our capacity to bring San Juan gas 
to the California border but there is also a positive environmental play for 
Black Mesa and coal slurry along with Mohave and coal pollution affecting the 
Grand Canyon.  This whole project is contingent on several factors, not the 
least of which is working with Mohave Generating Station majority owner AES 
(70%) to convert the plant to gas and working with the Navajo who could lose 
a large export market for their coal.  ENA has agreed to approach AES on this 
project in the near future once their negotiations on the Las Vegas power 
plant are complete.  Legal is checking the existing ROW to see if there are 
limitations on the pipe usage.  

Burlington Claim - We are assembling the volume and revenue impact figures of 
the November train derailment for submission to Burlington's claims 
adjusters.    This will be combined with the total operations costs.

Olympian Status for U.S. Gas Market 

Just so you'll know: "The natural gas market is a real success story. ...FERC 
has gotten an enormous amount of things right. The market may not be 
unblemished, but there are lots who consider the natural gas market the best 
market in the world offering genuine price discovery on a daily basis across 
dozens of products. It's something everyone should be proud of," Robert Levin 
of the New York Mercantile Exchange told a FERC conference yesterday. 

"The natural gas market has performed remarkably admirably through a range of 
market conditions with hundreds, if not thousands of market participants, 
using an extraordinary selection of market instruments," Levin continued, 
adding that the Commission should be supporting the "growth and increased 
sophistication of commerce. You're at that point now." 

Warning against so-called solutions offered by some at the day-long 
conference to increase liquidity or tie the natural gas market to the 
electric market, Levin cautioned, "liquidity cannot be legislated. Don't 
overreact. The electric market is poorly regulated. Remedies from the natural 
gas market should be transferred to the electric market, rather than allow 
the gas market to be corrupted by the regulatory mistakes of the electric 
market. 

"Rather than worry over regulating an hourly market for natural gas, change 
the electric market," which Levin believes has developed its over-emphasis on 
the hourly market because of the artificial tilt toward the spot market. 

But while Levin warned against too much market meddling, others among the 
more than 30 representatives of the industry and its customers testifying at 
FERC's conference on competitive natural gas markets argued for a variety of 
initiatives to increase market liquidity by changing the rules for pipeline 
transportation. 

Eliminating the shipper-must-have-title rule, promoting expansion of the 
existing pipeline infrastructure (especially in the Northeast), doing away 
with straight-fix-variable (SFV) rate design, review of firm-to-wellhead 
rates in the production region and the allocation of transportation costs 
between the upstream and downstream were among the chief proposals proffered 
by mostly pipeline customers. 

However, greater gas market liquidity shouldn't be confused with increased 
competition in pipeline transportation, municipals and producers told FERC 
staff during a post-Order 637 technical conference Wednesday. "...[W]e're 
concerned the Commission may be equating market liquidity with competition in 
pipeline transportation. The two are not the same," said Arthur Corbin on 
behalf of the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents 
municipal gas distributors. 

"Even with greater and greater market liquidity, monopoly power exists in 
[the] pipeline transportation segment. Captive shippers will always require a 
regulated transportation service from any hub to their citygate," he said. 

Much the same holds true for LDCs, noted Bruce Henning, director of energy 
practices for Energy and Environmental Analysis Inc. (EEA), who represented 
the American Gas Association (AGA) at the Commission staff conference. He 
agreed market liquidity has improved immeasurably, but he added "there's not 
a liquid market center at every pipeline receipt or delivery point location. 
Nor is there likely to be market centers in all of these locations in the 
near future..." Consequently, Henning said FERC will need to continue to 
protect producers from market power that accompanies "limited access" to 
pipelines. 

The day-long conference held yesterday in Washington D.C. was the first of 
several that FERC staff plans to hold to explore the impact of the 
Commission's transportation policies on the development of gas markets. 

Christopher A. Helms, president and COO of Panhandle Pipeline Companies, 
urged FERC not to enact policy changes that would place commodity market 
liquidity as the "ultimate goal" at the expense of the transportation market. 
Helms said he advocated policies encouraging pipeline expansions and 
construction of "optimal amounts of additional capacity" to meet the needs of 
the market. "The single most important characteristic for liquidity in the 
natural gas commodity markets is the availability of adequate transportation 
capacity." 

Charles Daverio, vice president of KeySpan Corp., echoed that sentiment, 
saying FERC could increase liquidity in the New York City market and 
elsewhere in the Northeast by promoting construction of new pipeline capacity 
to ensure adequate supplies for the region year-round. This would reduce 
energy costs and enhance reliability, he noted. 

Panhandle's Helms also cautioned against policy changes that would force the 
development of new market centers and hubs. Market centers should be allowed 
to develop at their "own pace," and at locations where the market "sees fit," 
he said. 

EEA's Henning estimated more than 40 "liquid and transparent" market centers 
exist today, which permit industry participants to buy and sell gas daily 
under "extremely competitive" conditions. He said he's "confident" more will 
be added because of the options that they provide to gas customers. As 
another way to enhance liquidity, KeySpan's Daverio --- as well as others --- 
supported eliminating the shipper-must-have-title rule, which requires the 
customer to retain title to the gas while it's being shipped. Doing away with 
the rule would pave the way for the development of new pipeline products and 
services, such as operational balancing and virtual storage, he told the FERC 
staff. 

But Dena Wiggins, an attorney with the D.C. law firm of Sutherland, Asbill & 
Brennan LLP, which represents the Process Gas Consumers Group (industrial gas 
customers), said her group was "very concerned" about efforts to repeal the 
rule. "...I haven't heard anything yet [today] that satisfies the concerns 
that we might have." She noted the Commission already has granted exceptions 
to the shipper-must-have-title rule in certain cases, and should continue 
with this policy where necessary. 

Moreover, Wiggins said industrial customers were increasingly worried about 
the mounting market power of unregulated companies, especially gas marketers. 

At the conference, she also expressed her group's dismay with the pipeline 
compliance filings with Order 637, particularly on the penalty issue. Rather 
than an "improved" penalty structure, pipelines are proposing higher 
penalties, Wiggins said. "[We] continue to be shocked at the absolute 
wholesale departures" from 637. 

BP's Jeff Holligan also waded into the fight against all the new services 
outlined by pipelines in their Order 637 filings, which he said were "nothing 
more than penalties disguised as balancing services that customers can't 
refuse." He urged the Commission to check with a pipeline's customers, noting 
one proposed new "service" is opposed by 100% of the pipeline's 
non-affiliated customers. Some of the proposed services, Holligan said, add 
up to nothing more than degradation of existing long-term firm service. 

Holligan, representing the largest producer in the U.S. and Canada, joined 
other market participants in urging adoption of "standardized allocation 
(sales), standardized penalty levels, and the requirement that all pipelines 
implement a uniform title transfer tracking process." In short, 
"standardizing pipeline services, certainly on an individual pipeline, and 
also to a large extent between and across pipelines is imperative if markets 
are to be highly liquid..Individually negotiated services, where every 
service is a different service, or the adoption of a so-called dual track 
market, are the antithesis of a highly liquid, efficient and competitive gas 
market. Standardization of operational terms of pipeline service is necessary 
to facilitate trading through e-commerce." 

"The Commission should be striving to commoditize pipeline capacity so it can 
be traded along with gas electronically," Holligan said.

El Paso Open Season Was 'Rigged,' CPUC Says

Armed with a "smoking gun" discovered in just-released data, the California 
Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has launched a fresh offensive against El 
Paso Natural Gas' 1.22 Bcf/d transportation contract arrangement with 
affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. 

Based on information uncovered in an internal e-mail, the CPUC now contends 
that the open season last February for one third of El Paso's firm 
transportation capacity was "rigged" to show preference to El Paso Merchant. 

The e-mail revealed that during the open season El Paso Merchant had 
"secretly negotiated" a two cents/MMBtu transportation discount rate on 
Mojave Pipeline, another El Paso affiliate, for service from Topock to 
Southern California Gas at Wheeler Ridge for quantities above 100,000 MMBtu/d 
effective March 1, 2000, the CPUC told FERC. The interruptible discount would 
last the entire 15 months of the new contracts offered in El Paso Natural 
Gas' open season, state regulators said, adding that Mojave had withheld 
announcing the discount until Feb. 18 --- after El Paso's open season had 
ended. 

The discounted capacity on Mojave was critical, given that FERC previously 
had ruled that about half of the 1.22 Bcf/d El Paso capacity (Block II 
capacity) could not directly access the SoCal-Topock delivery point. As a way 
around this restriction, bidders in the El Paso open season knew they could 
use El Paso capacity to access Mojave Pipeline at Topock, and then have their 
gas shipped to SoCal at Wheeler Ridge, the CPUC said. But what they didn't 
know was that Mojave had negotiated a discount with El Paso Merchant, the 
commission noted. The shippers were operating under the assumption that the 
IT rate still was four cents/MMBtu, which it had been for the previous 18 
months. 

The information about the discount was disclosed in a Feb. 9 e-mail written 
by El Paso Merchant Vice President Robin Cox, which acknowledged that "Mojave 
is willing to offer" a two cent/MMBtu discount rate for volumes above 100,000 
MMBtu/d. "I will not officially request this discount until next Wednesday 
assuming we win the capacity," the executive wrote. "After it is posted, it 
will be [available] to everyone." 

This e-mail makes "clear that El Paso Merchant received preferential 
treatment from El Paso/Mojave and had unfair advantages over all other 
bidders during the open season" in violation of Sections 4 and 5 of the 
Natural Gas Act, the CPUC charged. It urged FERC to "fulfill its duty and 
abrogate" the El Paso-El Paso Merchant contract arrangement.

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=
=20
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
AND ENRON WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=
ts=20
around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=
=20
EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=
f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=
nron=20
Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20
Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In=
=20
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=
=20
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=
d=20
Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=
nd=20
the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20
drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses. =
=20
The Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.

 We are also forming a new committee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Commit=
tee. =20
This group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel=20
management policy and corporate strategy.  The Enron Corporate Policy=20
Committee membership is also shown on the attached list.

 We are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital =
to=20
our highest return opportunities.  Please join us in congratulating and=20
supporting all of these individuals in their new roles.

Edison Mission Energy to build power plant in California

Edison Mission Energy, an Edison International company, is purchasing the
rights to the Sunrise Power Project from Texaco Power and Gasification. A
proposed power generation facility to be located in Kern County, Calif., the
project will bring both short- and long-term generation capacity to the
state, which is in dire need of new power generation.

The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases. Phase 1 will
consist of a 320-MW, simple-cycle peaking facility scheduled to be in
service during the summer of 2001. Phase 2 will convert the peaking facility
to a 560-MW, combined-cycle operation with an in-service date of summer
2003.

Final regulatory approvals should be received shortly for Phase I of the
project. Edison Mission Energy plans to seek expedited permitting approval
for the Phase II expansion in line with the fast-track approvals process
recently enacted by the California legislature.

Edison Mission Energy specializes in the development, acquisition,
construction management and operation of global power production facilities.
The company owns nearly 23,000 MW of generating capacity, including
interests in 75 projects currently under construction or operating in
Australia, Indonesia, Italy, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Spain, Thailand,
Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Subject: Monthly Briefing--The Pressure Cooker - CERA Alert




**********************************************************************
CERA Alert: Sent Thu, June 15, 2000
**********************************************************************

Title: Monthly Briefing--The Pressure Cooker
Author: N. American Natural Gas Team
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: North American Gas ,
URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1230 ,

Pressure remains extremely strong in the United States gas market, as three 
factors-increasing power generation demand, lower storage inventories, and US 
wellhead supply still struggling to rebound-call into question the ability to 
build storage to a level adequate for next winter. As strong as gas market 
fundamentals are, gas prices are being supported also by concurrent strength 
in oil and liquids markets, making traditional alternatives to gas much more 
expensive than in recent years.  In this environment intense competition 
between power generation demand and storage injections will continue 
throughout the summer-with pressure increasing into July as temperatures 
rise-and gas will continue to price at the high levels necessary to 
discourage end-use demand.

The $1.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) increase in gas prices 
since the beginning of May has already driven responses among end users. 
First, gas is now pricing at a slight premium to residual fuel oil on the 
East Coast, and gas will likely lose approximately 600 million cubic feet 
(MMcf) per day of demand to residual fuel oil this summer relative to last 
summer. Second, several ammonia manufacturing facilities have begun to shut 
down. Equally telling, however, is that heat in any one region of the 
country-most recently the West-is all that is required to sustain gas prices 
above $4.00 at the Henry Hub, despite relatively moderate temperatures 
elsewhere and demand reductions in industrial and other power markets. 
Underlying pressures are such that prices are likely to rise on average from 
current levels as higher temperatures arrive. For these reasons CERA expects 
prices to average $4.45 at the Henry Hub during July (see Table 1), and even 
greater volatility is !
possible. The intense competition and need to price out end-use demand mean 
that the market is vulnerable to spikes above $5.00 per MMBtu amid heat waves 
this summer.

Gas Storage-Injections Increase, but Little Relief Yet

The gas market experienced a small measure of relief in early June as storage 
injections finally reached a pace closer to historical averages, with the 
American Gas Association (AGA) reporting 78 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of 
injections during each of the weeks ending June 2 and 9. However, these 
injections did little to reduce a deficit that is now close to 400 Bcf on a 
year-over-year basis, and conditions may not again be as favorable as they 
have been recently for injections for many weeks, or even months, to come. As 
temperatures rise through the end of the month, injections are likely to 
slow, so that for June CERA expects an average injection rate of 
approximately 10 Bcf per day. The deficit that stood at an estimated 394 Bcf 
as of the end of May (see Table 2), on an inventory level of approximately 
1,454 Bcf, is expected to rise slightly during June, to 403 Bcf, despite a 
healthy injection rate for the first nine days of the month.

With US wellhead supply still running an estimated 0.5 to 1.0 Bcf per day 
below year-earlier levels and with added imports from Canada just offsetting 
this decline, even the moderate demand growth expected for July relative to 
last July will make reducing the deficit a difficult task. Each month in 
which this 400 Bcf deficit carries forward increases the likelihood that 
inventories will be at their lowest maximum ever this October. Injections 
like those in the recent two weeks would have to continue into July for this 
pattern to reverse in a significant way, an unlikely event that would occur 
only under very mild weather conditions.

Regional Markets

With the exception of the Rocky Mountains, western differentials have been 
supported by waves of hot weather and extremely strong gas demand for power 
generation within the region. This strong demand is pulling supplies from the 
Permian and San Juan Basins to the West Coast and has pushed up capacity 
utilization on the Southwest pipelines into California. Prices at the 
California border have been particularly strong, averaging over a $0.30 
premium to the Henry Hub so far this month. Continued strong western demand 
looks likely to support prices within the region through July, as power loads 
remain strong and hydroelectric output declines. In addition, the early heat 
waves have begun to erode the California storage surplus, although 
inventories in the region as a whole remain strong (see Table 3).

CERA's outlook by region follows:

*  Rockies. Continuing strong supply growth and low seasonal demand have 
pushed up exports out of the Rocky Mountains region. High utilization rates 
on export pipelines will keep Rocky Mountain differentials wide during the 
rest of the summer. CERA expects an average July differential to the Henry 
Hub of $0.55 per MMBtu.

*  San Juan. The pull on supplies from California has narrowed the 
differential between the San Juan Basin and the Henry Hub, and this West 
Coast pull looks likely to remain strong through the summer. CERA expects a 
differential between the San Juan Basin and the Henry Hub of $0.16 per MMBtu 
during July.

*  Permian and Mid-Continent. As Texas power loads increase, the competition 
from the West Coast and Texas markets for Permian supplies should intensify. 
Permian differentials, which have been averaging around $0.15 per MMBtu to 
the Henry Hub, should narrow. CERA expects a $0.06 per MMBtu differential for 
July. Mid-Continent supplies should price just below Permian supplies, at an 
$0.08 per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub.

*  Chicago. Chicago differentials continue to trade around $0.05 per MMBtu to 
the Henry Hub, and although hot weather and climbing demand within the region 
could put some upward pressure on those differentials, ample seasonal 
pipeline capacity into the region will limit pressure. CERA expects a July 
differential of $0.06 per MMBtu.

*  Northeast. New York citygate differentials have a higher floor this 
summer, namely higher fuel costs from the Gulf Coast as a result of $4.00 
gas. The result has been differentials above $0.30 from Transco Station 65 
but closer to $0.30 from the Henry Hub. As power generation load reaches its 
peak, however, differentials can rise even in summer. Short-lived power load 
peaks may lift weekly New York differentials into the $0.40s, but for the 
month of July CERA expects the New York differential to average $0.34.

Canadian Markets-Demand
Still Down

Canadian demand continues to be down on a year-over-year basis. Volumes on 
TransCanada Pipeline are 400 MMcf below levels at this time last year, and 
Alberta demand is 200 MMcf below; both of these reductions are primarily 
storage related. Weak storage injections, driven in large part by the lack of 
an adequate summer-winter price spread, continue to place inventories further 
behind 1999 levels. Although inventories are still well above the five-year 
average, unless injections increase, it is more likely that end-of-season 
inventories will be comparable to the five-year average (450 Bcf) rather than 
to 1999 levels (484 Bcf).

Export volumes continue to be slightly higher than last year. Thus far in 
June, flows on Northern Border Pipeline are similar to 1999, while PG&E GT-NW 
is currently operating 300 MMcf higher. Demand on the West Coast is expected 
to continue this trend for the summer.

Alberta supply build for June is likely to be flat with 1999 levels. An 
outage pattern similar to last year's has emerged. TCE/NOVA has had 
maintenance projects ongoing in June, but the supply reduction is primarily 
the result of plant turnarounds. Thus far in June, reductions in supply 
because of maintenance have been as high as 850 MMcf but should average 300 
MMcf for the month. Even though June is expected to be flat year-over-year, 
the fact that this maintenance reduction is less than 1999 maintenance 
reductions implies that a return to supply growth has not yet occurred. 
Supply is still expected to start showing growth in the second half of the 
year, largely in the fourth quarter, as a result of the increased level of 
drilling. The annual average supply is expected to be around 100 MMcf per day 
higher than in 1999 as the result of the return to growth in Alberta and 
modest growth in British Columbia (again primarily later in the year), as 
well as the new production from!
 Ft. Liard that is now onstream.

The NYMEX and Henry Hub price strength is being felt in Canada. AECO is 
expected to average C$5.15 per gigajoule (GJ) (US$3.69 per MMBtu) for June 
with a differential in the low US$0.60s. July is expected to average C$5.44 
per GJ (US$3.90 per MMBtu). The Henry-to-AECO differential is likely to 
remain relatively high until storage injections increase the demand.

Regarding the subject proposed interconnect, where EOG desires to receive 2 
MMcfd from TW's 16" Crawford lateral, the available connection available is a 
4" side valve (formerly used for Highland - Pecos Irrigation,  POI # 500269; 
Sect. 10, T23S-R28E, Eddy Co., New Mexico Higland-Pecos Irrigation).  The 
former measuring facilities, the lateral, and the 8" Crawford lateral were 
all sold to Duke.  TW measurement facilities do not exist at the interconnect 
that can be re-activated for EOG gas lift measurement/regulation.  Should EOG 
desire to receive lift gas from TW, then new measuring and regulating 
facilities will be required.  See Figure 1 below for connection details.

However, expected operating pressures available on the 16" Crawford lateral 
is common to suction pressures observed at the suction of WT-1 Compressor 
Station that varies between 580 - 630 psig (see Figure 2, daily average 
pressure graph for May-Oct 2000).  As you indicated that EOG's line pressure 
would be near 650 psig, it will not be possible for TW to deliver into EOG 
unless they can lower their line pressure to about 550 psig or add 
compression.  

If feasibility exists for EOG to add compression and you would like for me to 
proceed with providing a Level "A" cost estimate for measuring/regulating 
facilities, please reply or give me a call.  Eric - 713/853-3395

El Paso Closer to Acquiring PG&E's Texas Assets

El Paso Energy Corp. is closer to acquiring PG&E Corp.'s Texas gathering and 
liquids businesses for about $840 million in stock and debt after signing a 
consent agreement earlier this week. The deal includes 8,500 miles of natural 
gas transmission pipelines that transport about 2.8 Bcf/d, nine processing 
plants that process 1.5 Bcf/d, and a 7.2 Bcf natural gas storage field. 

PG&E National Energy Group bought the properties about three years ago from 
Valero Energy and Teco for $1.02 billion, but had been unable to turn a 
profit. When it purchased the properties, PG&E paid a premium price to enter 
the west-east gas transportation market. However, since the sale, the basis 
between Waha in West Texas and Katy and the Houston Ship Channel has 
tightened and PG&E could not overcome the roadblocks to become a major 
player. 

The assets, which also include significant natural gas liquids pipelines and 
fractionation facilities, serve all of Texas' major metropolitan areas, large 
industrial load centers and several natural gas trading hubs. The book value 
before the sale to El Paso was estimated to be between $2.5 billion and $2.7 
billion. 

Before buying PG&E's assets, El Paso was already an experienced player in the 
liquids game. When the deal was first announced, El Paso said that 70% of the 
cash flow generated by the Texas assets came from stable fee-based activities 
with the balance from processing. El Paso, which is close to completing a 
merger with The Coastal Corp., expects to actively manage the risk on the 
non-fee-based side. 

As part of the normal review process, the consent agreement signed this week 
is subject to the approval of the Federal Trade Commission. El Paso also has 
to finalize a similar agreement with the State of Texas. Once the agreements 
are approved, El Paso Energy expects to close the transaction in the fourth 
quarter.

Thanks again for your help on getting the well connected ASAP.  For the
weekend, we estimate we will be flowing around 34,000 mmbtu/day.
We have been replacing wellhead equipment and dehy's to allow for greater
production.
Hopefully this flow will continue for awhile.
We are selling the production at the interconnect, hopefully TW is getting
a good transport rate.  Earlier today, i could have paid TW $4.00/mmbtu
transport, got any FT?  $10.50 at the border, $5.50 at TW. Makes your FT
west shippers rich.

I know we have had numerous discussions with gas control, Michelle, field
people, etc.  Tell everyone thanks for the hard work.

Subject: base differential for TW deal analysis



Michelle,

Our dba has loaded TW base differential to test database from revenue 
management data base
after Vernon added TW to his regular update.
The spreadsheet is the latest NYMEX and base differential for 4 areas of TW 
as of 11/28/00.
Please take a look.  If no problem, I'll apply the same logic that I used to 
create this spreadsheet
to TW deal analysis program.  I'll dynamically get the latest price from the 
table based on 
receipt point location.
Please let me know.
Thanks,

Mei-Ling

This is CERA's Western Market forecast for November.

CERA Alert: Sent Tue, October 24, 2000

Title: No Rest for a Weary Market
Author:
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: Western Energy ,
URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1400 ,

*********************************************************

Rather than enjoying a respite, western energy markets will make November
a catch-up month. Natural gas demand will remain high when compared with
the same period last year, as gas-fired generation will continue to run at 
high
utilization rates and market participants try to restore gas storage to normal
levels. The tight supply situation will maintain upward pressure on gas
prices, which will range from $5.15 to $5.83 per million British thermal
units, depending on location. Refueling outages at three nuclear units, along
with a seasonal decline in hydroelectric output, will maintain gas-fired
generation on the margin for most of November. On-peak power prices will
remain higher as a result, in the $86-$98 per megawatt-hour range,
depending on location.

Please read note below from our SAP Timekeeping Team:


By now you have probably heard all about implementation of SAP Timekeeping 
and eHR Online.  Well it is almost upon us.  Some of the business units in 
GPG will implement self-service time entry but ET&S along with other business 
units will not implement self-service it at this time.  Your timekeeper will 
still be responsible for entering your payroll information i.e. vacation, 
sick.  Because of the upcoming July 3-4 holiday and more importantly the new 
SAP timekeeping system your timesheets should be submitted to your timekeeper 
as soon after June 23 as possible.  This will be the first time entry period 
via SAP and we want to insure that everything is entered correctly.  The new 
system is not as user friendly as the current system thus requiring more time 
to complete payrolls.  If you have changes to your timesheet after you have 
submitted it give a corrected copy to your timekeeper and the necessary 
adjustments will be made the following pay period.

Kern River Plans Expansion to Serve California Generators
 
posted 10:38 AM (CST) Nov 15, 2000 

Kern River Gas Transmission said it plans to file an application today with 
FERC to add 124,500 Dth/d of additional firm transportation capacity to its 
922-mile pipeline system. The California Expansion Project will provide 
additional capacity from Wyoming to markets in California. It also will 
provide an opportunity for Williams to offer significantly reduced rates for 
firm transportation based on recent approval of its Extended Term Rate 
Program, the company said.

"A combination of rapid growth and the development of new gas-fired power 
generation facilities in California is fueling expansion of the system," said 
Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River and Northwest 
Pipeline. The FERC application proposes construction of three new compressor 
stations, an additional compressor at an existing facility in Wyoming, 
restaging a compressor in Utah, and upgrading two meter stations. The $80 
million project is targeted to be complete by May 1, 2002.

Nymex Moves Gas Opening Bell Up to 9:30 a.m.

The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange has amended plans 
to move 
up the start-up time for natural gas futures trading because of the overlap 
with crude oil markets, 
which share an options ring with natural gas. Daily gas futures trading now 
will commence at 
9:30 a.m. rather than 9:45. The board has scheduled expanded energy trading 
hours to begin 
with the Sept. 8 trading session. 

On July 13, the board voted to expand futures trading hours electronically 
for its light sweet crude 
oil, heating oil, gasoline, and natural gas futures and options markets. It 
also voted to have an 
earlier opening for the open outcry session for natural gas futures and 
options.

Beginning at 4 p.m. on Sept. 7 the Nymex Access electronic trading sessions 
for those commodities 
will be extended to run from 4 p.m., Mondays through Thursdays, to 9 a.m. the 
following day. On 
Sundays, the session will begin at 7 p.m. and will run until 9 a.m. on 
Monday. Currently, the sessions 
for light sweet crude oil, heating oil and gasoline begin at the same times 
but close at 8 a.m. Natural 
gas futures and options currently are traded from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Mondays 
through Thursdays with 
no Sunday night session.

Fundamentals have taken center stage, as building demand pressure accompanies 
US supply declines. Storage inventories have been significantly reduced, and 
the pressure for storage injections is likely to intensify as we head into 
the summer months. Demand-driven growth continues, as completions of 
gas-fired power generation plants accelerate to a pace above 10,000 megawatts 
per year and economic growth stimulates electricity demand. The result is a 
higher-price playing field for natural gas, with the average Henry Hub price 
likely to reach $3.67 per MMBtu for 2000--its highest level since the 
development of spot markets.

Note:  I'm sure you have this on your radar screen, but just in case you 
don't...

PG&E Corp. announced that its National Energy Group will develop its first 
Nevada project, a 1,000 MW natural gas-fired generating plant to be located 
45 miles northeast of Las Vegas. The merchant plant's main purpose is to 
supply Nevada, but when it is not needed there, it will add much-needed 
supply to the western energy market. The group hopes to begin construction 
during the fourth quarter of 2001, with completion expected in early 2004. 
"Southern Nevada has one of the most rapidly growing economies in the 
country," said Thomas B. King, president of PG&E NEG, West Region. "Because 
of its location near Las Vegas, the Meadow Valley project will be ideally 
positioned to efficiently serve that demand growth." Including the Nevada 
project, PG&E National Energy Group has a total of 4,000 MW in development or 
construction in California, Oregon, Nevada and Arizona.

As we discussed in staff meeting this morning, please provide me with a 
summary of any type of transport options imbedded in your assigned customer 
accounts' contracts (i.e., contract #, Shipper name, explanation of option, 
term of contract, term of option, how much advance notice to trigger the 
option, etc.).  I will incorporate these transport options into a capacity 
spreadsheet which will be forwarded to our group.

Please try to forward this information to me at your earliest convenience.  
Thanks.

Lorraine

Alliance Deliveries Delayed until Nov. 13

In a move that is likely to send ripples through the market, particularly 
around Chicago, the 1.325 Bcf/d Alliance Pipeline extended its commercial 
in-service delay last week to Nov. 13 from Oct. 30. Pipeline officials said 
moisture and debris in the line caused the delay. 

"As we have increased the flow of test gas volumes during our system 
commissioning, we have encountered moisture and debris from construction," 
said CEO Norm Gish. "Specifically, most of the debris is in the form of small 
pieces of foam from the [smart] pigs that were used to remove the hydrostatic 
testing water from the line. The problem forced us to shut down the system 
for short periods of time to clean out accumulated debris. 

"We have since designed and installed additional in-line screens at our 
compressor stations. The situation is improving and we are removing 
ever-decreasing amounts of debris with increased flows of test gas. However, 
this situation has not permitted us to run our system with the significant 
volumes necessary to adequately test the reliability of our compressors." 

It is the second time Alliance has had to delay its in-service date. In early 
September, Alliance officials said rain in Saskatchewan this summer, 
directional drilling problems at a creek in British Columbia, complex 
connection problems with the Aux Sable liquids plant in Illinois and 
connection delays with several U.S. pipelines and LDCs was to blame for a 
one-month delay to Oct. 30 (see Daily GPI, Sept. 11). 

The pipeline will continue increasing test volumes until it begins commercial 
service, said Gish. There currently is about 500 MMcf/d of test gas in the 
line. He expects firm delivery capacity to reach the full 1.325 Bcf/d prior 
to Nov. 13. 

Alliance officials also noted that this is the first time a pipeline the size 
of Alliance has been brought on stream at one time. 

Regardless of the challenge, however, market participants were expecting the 
system to be delivering gas starting at the beginning of the month of 
November and this delay is likely to have a significant impact on November 
bidweek trading. 

One Chicago trader said he had a strong suspicion something was fishy when 
his index offers were lifted Friday afternoon by a marketing company, which 
he knows to own capacity on the pipe. "Everyone was a buyer of index gas 
today for November, especially those now short for the first 13 days. I sold 
mine at NGI plus 1.5, but had I known that Alliance was delayed I would have 
held out for something a little better." 

Basis, meanwhile, was pretty much unchanged at +13 to +14 for November. "It 
takes a lot to move the Chicago basis," he said.

Commercialize your intelligence on the Edge this week.  How?  Go to the Edge 
and post information that might grab someone else's interest.  That "someone 
else" views your information and uses it to competitively position Enron.  
It's that easy.


It's another "Big 2" week for eSpeak!
Tuesday, October 17 at 10:00 am Houston time, join Steve Hotte, vice 
president and CIO of Enron Transportation Services.  Steve will conduct an 
"open mike" session about technology at ETS.
Thursday, October 19 at 10:00 am Houston time, Shelly Payne, benefits 
supervisor, and Sandy Huseman, senior benefits analyst, will be on eSpeak to 
answer your questions about Open Enrollment.
Don't forget:  You can post your questions before either of these events on 
the eSpeak site.

Provided below are timelines representing the time between Shipper request 
for transportation and contract tendering by Transwestern for two of the more 
recent non-standard contracts which were provided by Transwestern to 
Southwest Gas Corporation and Sempra.  The provided timelines provide an 
example of the various factors which impact the turn-around time of a 
Shipper's request for service and the actual activation of a new or amended 
transportation service.

Kevin Hyatt has received a flow chart of all the processes of acquiring an 
executed contract from the point of contract negotiation to actual executing 
by shipper - a 10 step process.  Our group can certainly discuss options to 
expedite this process. 

Sempra

6/9  Sempra negotiates right to call upon TW Permian to Needles capacity.
  Sempra understands they need to submit formal request for transportation 
  for new service.
6/12  Stephanie Katz indicates she want the remaining 1,500 Dth/d of Needles 
  capacity.  Has not yet provided TW request for the "call" capacity.
6/20  Stephanie and TK negotiate rate for the 1,500.  Does not provide TW
  request for Transportation.
6/21  Sempra provides request for transportation for the 23,000 Dth/d of 
  capacity, but specifically asks TW to WAIT to process untill they
  determine their supply side receipt point allocation.  CS attempts to
  relay to Sempra the "alternate rights" which the discount letter will 
  contain as a heads-up.  Stephanie thinks she may want other
  flexibility (California Border alternates) and tells me to WAIT untill
  she thinks about it.
6/26  CS calls Sempra to remind them time is ticking.  Sempra finally 
remembers
  to lock up supply side of deal. Promises to call me TOMORROW.
6/27  Sempra leaves a message at 4:30 P.M with receipt point allocations. 
6/28   CS asks Stephanie if she plans to negotiate with Jeff for additional
   alternates like she had considered, she says no.  Now that TW finally 
  has received a complete request for transporation Contract Admin
  generates the contract with a 2-hour period.
    CS immediately routes mutually agreed upon discount letter to officers
   for approval.
6/29  Request made as to reason for delay of contract tendering to Sempra. 



Southwest Gas Corporation

5/25  Receive SWG request for transportation service.  CS begins to draft
  discount letter with SWG, specifically confirms all provisions of contract
  with account manager.
5/31  Contract received from Contract Administration.
6/5  CS received all Officer approvals for discount letter except Bill Cordes.
6/6  CS hunts down Bill Cordes for final officer approval.  Receives Approval.

  CS faxes Larry Black on 6/6 Transwestern's OFFICER APPROVED 
  contract and discount letter .
  CS leaves Larry Black a voice-mail indicating contract is out.
  CS leaves Lorraine message indicating contract was sent.

6/9  Lorraine receives "follow-up" changes from May Kay to discount letter.
  Refaxes Larry Black revised letter .
6/12  CS receives another "follow-up" change from May Kay to discount letter.
  Refaxes Larry Black another revised letter.
6/13  Larry Black calls me indicating there are accidentally two #2

El Paso Explosion Takes 500 MMcf/d Off Market

About 1 Bcf/d of flow on El Paso's South Mainline downstream of Pecos River 
(NM) Station ceased after the 
pipeline exploded early Saturday, killing 10 people and seriously injuring 
two others at a nearby campsite.

El Paso said Monday it was able to compensate for about half that volume 
through a combination of fuel 
switching by downstream customers, maximum storage withdrawals, an OFO and 
other customer cooperation. 

The market reaction was rather predictable as all three California points 
rose by about 35 cents to lead an 
overall price surge. However, utilities in the state did not appear to be 
experiencing any supply problems. 
SoCal Gas said storage and supplies from other Southwest receipt points were 
adequate to avoid any 
problems. A gas operations official for Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power 
also saw no reason for panic. 
>From past similar incidents on Southwest pipelines, he expected that the 
approximately 80-feet-long section 
missing from El Paso's line could be "slapped back into place rather 
quickly." 

El Paso itself had no estimate for when it can restore service in the 
impacted segment; it must get approval 
rom the federal investigators before beginning repairs or evaluating a 
restart of the adjacent lines. But a large 
aggregator and a marketer agreed with the LADWP official that it should be "a 
quick mechanical fix" once 
repairs begin. The aggregator believed downtime could be as short as a week. 

No customers were cut off as a result of the rupture but some were getting 
reduced volumes, an El Paso 
spokeswoman said. 

Northern Natural Gas was seeing a throughput increase of 200-300 MMcf/d 
Monday while Transwestern 
volumes were up 50-75 MMcf/d as a result of shippers diverting gas away from 
El Paso's South Mainline, 
an Enron spokeswoman said. A producer said she diverted as much of her 
company's gas as possible from 
El Paso to Transwestern. 

People were reluctant to trade Permian Basin gas Monday, especially at fixed 
prices, because of doubts 
about how much would be able to flow, several sources said. Permian numbers 
rose a little less than 18 cents 
as part of the general upturn. However, it was Waha prices that saw a bigger 
increase of nearly 30 cents as a 
result. "Everything in El Paso-Permian's Keystone pool was going back into 
Waha," said a marketer, putting 
Waha in the mid $4.60s at a premium of more than a nickel above Henry Hub. 

The Southern California border, at an average of nearly $5.30, led the rest 
of Monday's market by a large margin. 
Before trading began, EnronOnline was offering border swing swaps for the 
rest of the month at $5.85-95, a 
marketer said. With swing swaps priced so high, it gave sellers more 
confidence in what prices they could 
command in the day market, he said. "Either way, I wouldn't want to be short 
right now at the border." 

There were lots of rumors but no facts available on what caused the El Paso 
rupture, noted one aggregator. 
"But it's a good thing it didn't happen until after California had cooled 
off. Otherwise I could easily have seen 
the border basis spread from San Juan Basin go as high as $2.50" instead of 
the approximate gap of $1.70 
egistered Monday by Daily GPI. 

A knowledgeable source provided his analyis of the blast: The structure of 
the crater made the rupture "look 
like a line integrity problem from the way it blew out." The earth can harbor 
leaking gas for a while until eventually 
everything all goes up at once. People nearby would not have detected 
anything because gas is odorless in 
long-haul lines; the mercaptan odorant is not added until it gets to the 
local distribution stage. Pipeline safety 
surveyors usually will look for dead vegetation in the vicinity to detect a 
leak, but this was a desert area with very 
little vegetation. It is easily possible for escaping gas to hug the ground 
for the approximate 500-foot distance to 
the victims' campsite and seek an ignition source there. It is a normal 
tendency for gas leaking into the atmosphere 
to stay close to the ground, and that tendency would have been amplied by the 
chilliness of the pre-dawn desert. 

The source went on to say, "I think there will be lot more of this [ruptures] 
in the future with many pipes becoming at 
least 40-50 years old." El Paso was unlucky in experiencing one of the early 
incidents, he said, because the situation 
applies to the other lines with old pipe. Pipelines used to spend a lot more 
money on maintenance when regulation 
was tighter and they were still paying for depreciation, he said. "Now 
they're more purely for-profit companies after 
having written off their [depreciation] costs many times over."

El Paso Blast Kills 10; Shuts Down South Mainline

Federal and company investigators Monday swarmed over the scene of the 
devastating El Paso Natural Gas 
mainline explosion that erupted near daybreak Saturday, engulfing a party of 
weekend campers along the Pecos 
River near Carlsbad, NM, and killing 10 people. Two other persons were 
hospitalized in critical condition. 

Three officials from the federal Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) and 11 with 
the National Transportation Safety 
Board (NTSB) have been at the site of the blast since late Saturday, and two 
more OPS officials were en route 
Monday. New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, who flew to the area on Sunday, said he 
wanted to know how many 
other potential pipeline "dangers" there are in the state. He called for a 
thorough investigation. 

About 1 Bcf/d of capacity on El Paso's southern leg initially was lost from 
the ruptured 30-inch line and two looped 
lines nearby that were shut in after the accident. El Paso was making up some 
of the shortfall by drawing the 
maximum, 200 MMcf/d from its Washington Ranch Storage Field downstream of the 
accident. Increased use of 
other pipelines, allocations and cutbacks by customers, and the fact that 
weather had moderated in California 
helped ease the supply situation. Nevertheless, spot prices increased by 
about 35 cents for points in California, 
while the rest of the market (spurred by Hurricane Debby) went up about 20 
cents. 

There was no estimate as to when the looped lines would be back in service, 
according to El Paso spokesperson 
Kim Wallace. 

"We don't intend to put anything back into service until we know for certain 
that the remaining pipelines are safe," 
Wallace said. She did not expect them to be back in service today, and could 
give no time frame on when they 
would be returned to service. 

It is "much too premature at this point" to predict when the three disabled 
El Paso westbound lines will return to 
service, said Patricia Klinger, a spokeswoman with the Department of 
Transportation's Research and Special 
Programs Administration (RSPA), which oversees the OPS. 

"The one that ruptured is definitely going to be out of service for awhile, 
and [another line] is badly damaged 
from the fire." As for a third adjacent line, that "could potentially be 
re-opened," but "we have to test the integrity 
of that line" and have it examined by metallurgists, she told Daily GPI. 
"Everyone will be working, of course, to 
try to get this [line] back in service. But the safe operation of the 
pipeline is of premiere importance." The three 
lines shared the same right-of-way. 

"We're just now able to start looking at exactly what happened, and how to 
get that one line back in service," 
Klinger said. "Our metallurgist is on his way right now. I know he's going to 
meet with the NTSB when they're 
examining the 50-foot section of pipe that's out of the ground" as a result 
of the explosion. "I think the company 
also wants to decide what types of tests can be done on this line. It's not 
piggable." 

The NTSB, which has set up a command center in Carlsbad, NM, declined to make 
any preliminary speculation 
about the cause of the explosion. "It's much too early for us to even think 
about the cause of this accident. We're 
only dealing with the facts...Right now, we're documenting the pipe itself 
and surveying the land. We're going to 
look at the chronology of when the [emergency] calls came in..... document 
damage to vehicles, and injuries," 
said NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway. 

"Probably at this point we're looking at nine months to a year, maybe more" 
before the results of the investigation 
are publicly disclosed, Holloway noted. 

The rupture occurred at 5:30 a.m. MDT in the underground line near the Pecos 
River crossing, which is about 30 
miles south of the Carlsbad Caverns National Park in a spot popular with 
local campers and fishermen. The blast 
tore a crater in the earth about 86 feet long, 46 feet wide and 20 feet deep. 

According to preliminary reports, the pipeline was underground at the point 
of rupture, sending two sections of pipe, 
each about 20-feet long, flying hundreds of feet. The gas then ignited and 
shot flames from the broken pipe toward 
sleeping campers. The NTSB estimated there was a gap of 50 to 60 feet between 
broken ends of the pipeline at 
the site. The fire burned for about 40 minutes before El Paso workers 
manually shut off pipeline valves. 

Ten members of two families were burned to death in the blast. The families, 
who were related by marriage, were 
camping on public land along the river near where the pipeline emerged from 
the ground to cross the Pecos in an 
aerial crossing alongside a bridge. Six were pronounced dead at the scene and 
four others died at Texas hospitals 
Saturday night. The dead included five children under the age of six, 
including six-month-old twins. Two adults were 
listed in critical condition Monday at a hospital in Lubbock, TX. 

The ruptured pipeline, which El Paso said was constructed in 1950, is one of 
four that runs along the southern branch 
of El Paso's pipeline system. There is an adjacent 30-inch pipeline and 
another 26-inch pipeline. The fourth, a 
16-inch pipeline, was abandoned and is not available for service, Wallace 
said. El Paso and federal officials are 
particularly interested in the integrity of the second 30-inch pipeline that 
ran close to the broken line. 

Wallace said that none of the company's customers had been cut off of 
service, but they were receiving gas as 
reduced levels. 

She also said that on Aug. 2, a "patrol" inspection, either done by air or 
vehicle, was conducted on the pipelines 
located near the Pecos River by El Paso officials and no problems were found. 
El Paso conducted the last 
corrosion test in February and no problems were found then either. Visual 
inspections are conducted on all of the 
system's pipelines once a month, she said, and the company follows all 
federal pipeline requirements for inspections. 

Asked whether El Paso planned to change its inspection system immediately, 
Wallace said that she did not think 
so, but said that if the NTSB review finds something that needs to be 
changed, the company will do whatever needs 
to be done immediately. 

"These situations are so rare," she said. "We don't feel that we need to 
change what we're doing now. But if the 
situation warrants, we certainly will make any changes necessary." 

El Paso is working with family members to take care of their immediate needs, 
including hotel accommodations, 
food, travel arrangements and medical treatment. The company also is 
providing additional services as needed. 

"This is a tragic accident and our heartfelt condolences go out to the 
families involved," said El Paso Energy President 
William Wise. He said the company was working with the NTSB "to investigate 
diligently all matters surrounding this
 accident and to establish its cause as quickly as possible." 

The fallout of the explosion is expected to extend all across the country, as 
federal legislators consider more 
stringent pipeline rules following an explosion in Bellingham, WA, that 
killed three in June 1999. Locally, Carlsbad 
Mayor Gary Perkowski said that he wanted to find out what happened and keep 
it from ever happening again. 

That reaction was echoed by the New Mexico governor. "I have a lot of 
questions," said Johnson. "What is the 
reliability of these pipelines? What went wrong? Was it preventable?" 

Meanwhile, RSPA was sifting through its history to determine whether the El 
Paso blast was the biggest pipeline 
disaster on record in terms of fatalities. 

Timeline: 

5:26 a.m. Aug. 19: El Paso Natural Gas' automated computer reading of the 
pressure in the pipeline indicates 
673.5 pounds per square inch. 

Around 5:30 a.m.: An El Paso Natural Gas employee bow-hunting in the area 
sees a large fireball at the scene. 

5:30 a.m.: El Paso Natural Gas' automated computer reading of the pressure in 
the pipeline drops to 377.19 
pounds per square inch. 

5:30 a.m.: Carlsbad Fire Department responds to the emergency. 

6:12 a.m.: Carlsbad Fire Department arrives at the scene. 

6:21 a.m.: El Paso Natural Gas workers shut off the gas line using manual 
valves. 

Between Jan. 1 and June 30 of this year, there have been 40 transmission 
pipeline incidents, according to the OPS. 
Fourteen were caused by either external or internal corrosion; 11 were 
damaged by outside forces; three were due 
to construction or material defects; and 10 were unknown. There was only one 
fatality until June 30 of this year on 
transmission pipeline incidents, which was caused by an outside force. Eleven 
people had been injured through June. 

In August 1999, OPS sent a warning letter to El Paso, citing it for a number 
of pipeline safety violations in Arizona. 
The OPS did not impose a civil fine on El Paso, but it advised the pipeline 
that "should you not correct the 
circumstances leading to the violation, we will take enforcement actions when 
and if the continued violation comes 
to our attention."

El Paso Blast May Cinch Tough Pipe Safety Bill

The explosion on El Paso Natural Gas' system, which killed 10 people over the 
weekend, may give Congress 
the added boost to pass a tough pipeline safety reauthorization bill when it 
returns from recess in September, 
Capitol Hill insiders said Monday. 

"This just sadly proves why Congress needs to act as soon as it returns [on 
Sept. 5] to pass the Pipeline Safety
 Improvement Act before any more innocent lives are taken," said a 
spokeswoman for Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). 

In June, Chairman McCain's Senate Commerce Committee voted out the Pipeline 
Safety Improvement bill that 
would, among other things, give states inspection and oversight authority 
over interstate pipelines; require 
interstate pipelines to consult with states about their integrity plans; 
create stiffer penalties for pipeline safety 
transgressors; and offer protection to whistle-blowers who report pipeline 
violations. McCain proposed the 
agressive safety bill following the product pipeline explosion in Bellingham, 
WA, that killed three in June 1999. 

"McCain has always been determined to pass this bill this year, but this 
obviously sadly strengthens that resolve," 
she said. He "will make a determined effort for this to happen," but whether 
it's brought up for a vote on the Senate 
floor will be up to Senate Leader Trent Lott (R-MS), the McCain spokeswoman 
said. 

"I have no doubts" that the Senate will push for pipeline safety when it 
returns, said Terry Boss, vice president of 
environment, safety and operations for the Interstate Natural Gas Association 
of America (INGAA). 

On the House side, a companion to McCain's bill has been introduced, as well 
as a number of other pipeline safety 
measures, but most are at the subcommittee level. But the issue could pick up 
steam in the wake of the El Paso 
blast. "We must examine why this accident occurred and ensure that it must 
never happen again," said Rep. Joe 
Skeen (R-NM). 

"Definitely it's a tragic situation," Boss said, referring to the explosion 
near Carlsbad, NM, which reportedly left a 
crater about 20 feet deep, 46 feet wide and 86 feet long. Five of the 10 
fatalities were children, who were spending 
a weekend camping and fishing with their family along the Pecos River. 

The political fallout from the disaster was being assessed in Washington D.C. 
yesterday. "Any kind of incident 
has political ramifications.....We're just not sure how this is going to 
'directly impact'" pending legislation and 
regulations, Boss noted.

Note:  The buyer of the El Paso interest in Oasis has not been announced.  A 
consent agreement has been filed with the 
FTC and State of Texas Tennesse Pipeline as part of the normal review process 
prior to final approval for the PG&E Texas
assets formally owned by Valero and TECO.   Tennessee had a note in their 3rd 
quarter 10-Q on El Paso possibly putting 
some of the PG&E Texas acquired properties in their MLP.  They also indicated 
they had put their Crystal Storage in the MLP.

El Paso to Sell Oasis Pipe Stake

El Paso Energy Corp. will sell its 35% stake in Oasis Pipe Line, a 1 Bcf/d 
line in Texas, according to a disclosure in a securities filing made last 
week. El Paso said that the sale, which was negotiated in October, would 
result in a $20 million loss. 

The 36-inch intrastate gas line runs 608 miles from the West Texas Waha 
market to the Katy hub outside of Houston. The pipeline provides a link 
between El Paso Natural Gas and Tennessee Gas Pipeline, and is the principal 
route for Permian Basin supplies to access the Houston Ship Channel. 

Oasis completed a substantial upgrade in 1998, installing 9,400 horsepower of 
compression, and new interconnects to increase deliveries to eastern markets. 

Dow Hydrocarbons and Aquila Energy, a unit of Utilicorp United, also own 
stakes in the line. Along with its 35% ownership, Aquila also has firm 
transport rights on 280,000 Mcf/d. 

Before El Paso's sale is complete, it still needs approvals from the Federal 
Trade Commission and the Texas Attorney General.

Title: Monthly Briefing: A Shoulder Month Without Shoulder Prices

**********************************************************************

As western markets continue to struggle through high August demand and prices 
for both power and natural gas, September looms as the start of the fall 
shoulder season. The shoulder season historically has brought the possibility 
of a break in weather and a demand drop in both power and gas prices from 
summer levels. CERA expects this shoulder season to differ from years past, 
however, with power and gas markets producing strong year-over-year prices 
and little relief from summer levels, even with normal September weather.

West-wide power loads will decline but will remain similar to those in June, 
a month with high power prices. In addition, compared with June levels 
hydroelectric capacity has dropped owing to reduced stream flows, leaving 
more expensive gas-fired generation to replace declining hydroelectric 
output. CERA expects occasional hot weather and higher gas prices to push 
on-peak prices in the West to 244 percent over September 1999 levels.

Continued strong use of gas-fired generation in the West, as well as low US 
storage inventories and tight supply demand balances, will keep the pressure 
on gas prices. Topock prices are expected to average $4.45 per million 
British thermal units (MMBtu) in September.

These high September gas and power prices are driven by

* Declining hydroelectric output. The months of September through November 
represent the low point for hydroelectric output in the West, with rainfall 
historically boosting output in December. Approximately 16,400 average 
megawatts (aMW) will be available from hydroelectric facilities during the 
three-month period. This represents a net reduction in capacity of 6,900 aMW 
when compared with the recent June-August summer months and a reduction of 
3,600 aMW when compared with September 1999 levels.

* Higher, more variable power demand. The Southwest and Southern California 
still experience hot weather in September, and regional utilities typically 
consider it possible that a year's peak load event will occur in September. 
Spiking loads, however, can quickly retreat with a return to cooler weather. 
Thus, power loads and power prices are expected to experience a high degree 
of variability during September.

* High levels of gas-fired generation. Load growth and a declining 
hydroelectric resource base will require gas-fired resources to serve 
approximately the same level of demand as in June 2000, a month with similar 
average demand and monthly average on-peak power prices in the $150-$178 per 
megawatt-hour (MWh) range, depending on the region. This strong pull on 
gas-fired plants will push deep into the generation resource base, driving 
prices upward. An additional 1.7 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day will be 
required for gas-fired generators in the US West compared with September 1999 
levels.

* Strong North American gas prices. Natural gas prices are expected to retain 
most of this summer's peak levels, as North American supplies remain tight. A 
market anxious about winter demand and price levels will also limit a price 
retreat this fall. As a result, average September Henry Hub prices are 
expected to trade around $3.95 per MMBtu. An active storm season could keep 
Henry Hub prices near the $4.50 mark.

* Strong western basis differentials. The strong demand for gas to serve 
gas-fired generation and storage concurrently will maintain western basis 
differentials at high levels, especially in the California markets. CERA 
expects a Topock-to-Henry Hub differential of $0.40 per MMBtu during 
September. Extended operational problems associated with El Paso's pipeline 
rupture would raise that outlook.

Regional Power Market Drivers
Hotter-than-normal August weather, transmission and generator outages, high 
natural gas prices, and declining hydroelectric output all contributed to a 
rise in power price levels during August. Southern California average power 
prices in August have thus far exceeded July levels by an average of $90 per 
MWh during the on-peak period and by $14 per MWh during the off-peak period. 
Mid-Columbia power prices, bearing the brunt of fire-induced transmission 
outages, experienced a jump from July price levels of $114 per MWh for the 
on-peak period and $20 per MWh in the off-peak period.

Off-peak prices, which have averaged above $60 per MWh during the June-August 
period, are clearly defined by the production cost of gas-fired resources. 
On-peak prices during this same period, at over $100 per MWh in all regions 
in all months, have reflected a significant premium at times over the cost of 
the marginal system generator (see Table 1).

A return to normal weather should drive West-wide loads down by 8,300 aMW in 
September from August levels. However, load growth and a return to normal 
weather are expected to push loads up by 5,400 aMW when compared with 
September 1999 levels. These greater loads, coupled with a reduction in 
hydroelectric generation of 3,600 aMW from last September's levels, will 
create supply tightness during September (see Tables 2 and 3).

Hydroelectric, coal, and nuclear generation together will be insufficient to 
serve West-wide demand in September, even during much of the off-peak 
periods, requiring gas-fired resources to meet a significant portion of the 
load. Gas demand for power generation is expected to average 5.2 Bcf per day 
in September, down from over 5.9 Bcf per day in August but up by a dramatic 
1.7 Bcf per day compared with levels in September 1999.

September power prices will be defined by a floor set by the incremental cost 
of gas-fired generation, approximately $50 per MWh, with prices frequently 
higher as demand increases. As this summer has clearly demonstrated, prices 
rise in a nonlinear fashion as supplies grow very tight. Hot weather-induced 
loads should provide additional examples of this relationship. * Cooler- or 
hotter-than-normal weather in September, coupled with the inherent high 
variability of September loads, will produce a wide range of price outcomes. 
Under normal weather, on-peak power prices are expected to fall in the 
$113-$123 per MWh range, depending on location, representing a 244 percent 
premium to year-ago September prices (see Figure 1).

The latest revision of the California Independent System Operator's (ISO's) 
imbalance energy market cap down to $250 per MWh is expected to depress 
market prices during any weather events in September. CERA expects the ISO 
price cap to limit prices outside of California as well.

Pacific Northwest
Although demand levels in the Pacific Northwest are expected to retreat in 
September by at least 1,100 aMW compared with those in the hotter-than-normal 
month of August, the loss in available capacity from hydroelectric resources 
will amount to 1,900 aMW over the same period (see Table 4). Thus, the 
Pacific Northwest will be in an even more limited position to export power to 
other regions. With transmission interties operating at below rated capacity 
during this period, power prices in the Pacific Northwest will maintain their 
tight relationship with those in Northern California. These price levels will 
continue to support the operation of the region's limited quantity of 
gas-fired generation. Mid-Columbia on-peak price levels are expected to 
average $118 per MWh in September.

Off-peak power price levels in the Pacific Northwest will also receive a 
boost from the strong markets to the south. The expected September level of 
$54 per MWh represents the opportunity cost of power sales in surrounding 
markets.

California
The fall months initiate a seasonal shift in price differentials that 
separates the West into markets that lie north of transmission Path 15 and 
those to the south. As in years past, hydro-depleted Northern California 
should experience demand levels that must be served by generation resources 
within the region. Exports from the Pacific Northwest dwindle, and energy 
from the nuclear and coal-rich Southwest is constrained from entering 
Northern California by Path 15 import limitations. This condition, which is 
expected to persist from September through November, allows Northern 
California to price at a premium. The expected monthly average on-peak 
Northern California price of $123 per MWh incorporates this dynamic. Notably, 
the California ISO is completing a process to remap the zones in California, 
in part to capture locational price differences more effectively.

Southern California, like the Southwest, will typically experience hot 
weather episodes in September. During these high demand periods, prices will 
rise to peak levels as experienced this summer. In addition, California as a 
whole should see average loads in September that are 4,600 aMW higher than 
those of September 1999. Occasional cooler weather will sharply but 
temporarily reduce daily prices. Southern California benefits from the 
abundant export capacity of the Southwest during cooler weather in that 
region, allowing prices to fall well below those in Northern California. An 
$8 per MWh differential between the north and south portions of the state is 
expected, with Southern California on-peak prices averaging $115 per MWh.

Off-peak prices of $53 and $47 per MWh for Northern and Southern California, 
respectively, reflect the continued need for gas-fired resources to support 
September off-peak loads.

Rockies and Southwest
An extended period of hot weather in July and August has boosted demand in 
the Rockies, a region with growing saturation of residential air 
conditioning. Limited transmission capacity and a dearth of cheaper exports 
from surrounding regions have allowed the Rockies to price temporarily at a 
premium to all other regions in the West.

A return to normal weather in September should restore the previously tight 
relationship of Rockies prices to those in the North. Rockies prices are 
expected to fall with loads, with a September monthly on-peak price average 
of $113 per MWh and an off-peak price average of $43 per MWh.

CERA expects Southwest prices to be tightly connected to prices in Southern 
California on a monthly average basis. The two regions generally experience 
the same September weather patterns, and a strong 7,600 MW transmission link 
between the two market centers allows them to balance loads with each other. 
Strong gas prices and occasional market tightness-induced price run-ups will 
maintain on-peak prices at the $115 per MWh level in September. Off-peak 
prices will, like those in Southern California, be buoyed by the high cost of 
gas-fired generation. A price level of $47 per MWh is expected for off-peak 
prices.

Regional Gas Market Drivers
The summer competition for gas supply between power and storage continues in 
North America, with gas prices reflecting the intensity of that competition. 
Even as the summer power peak subsides in September across the United States, 
the need to continue strong storage injections and the threat of storms in 
the Gulf will keep prices high and volatile. The storage deficit now stands 
at approximately 350 Bcf, and US storage inventories look likely to head into 
winter at historically low levels. This critical storage situation will keep 
prices high despite overall declines in power loads in September. CERA 
expects a Henry Hub price of $3.95 per MMBtu during September.

In the West strong power loads and the potential for power peaks persist 
through September, especially in California. Overall, total demand for gas is 
expected to decline across the West from 10.1 Bcf per day during August to 
9.8 Bcf per day during September (see Table 5). This load will tend to keep 
intraregional differentials wide throughout the West during the month. The 
recent price disconnects between the supply-rich Rocky Mountains and San Juan 
Basin and demand-charged California will persist. October should bring some 
change in this dynamic as heating loads in the Rockies begin to increase.

In general, winter will bring a dramatic shift in regional pricing 
differentials throughout the West. The summer pressure on Rocky Mountain 
supplies caused by high utilization rates on most export pipelines will be 
relieved somewhat by regional heating loads. Declines in flows into the San 
Juan Basin from the Rockies will take some downward pressure off prices in 
the San Juan. On the other hand, healthy California storage inventories 
should limit price premiums at Topock through the heating season. The 
start-up of the new Alliance pipeline, which will draw gas to the Midwest, 
will support prices in the Pacific Northwest and California.

California
Topock continues to be the premium pricing point in North America, although 
differentials between Southern California and the Henry Hub subsided somewhat 
from peak levels near $1.00 per MMBtu before this weekend's pipeline 
explosion. Total imports into California reached record levels during July; 
total imports of 5.8 Bcf per day eclipsed the previous high by 300 million 
cubic feet (MMcf) per day (see Table 6). Pipeline capacity into the state 
during the month ran at 83 percent utilization. So far in August, pipeline 
capacity utilization is exceeding even that high rate, running at 85 percent. 
These high rates of capacity utilization are putting pressure on gas prices 
in Southern California, and the pressure should continue during September.

Total demand in California is expected to decline somewhat during September, 
but continued strong power loads and low seasonal hydroelectric generation 
will provide support. Total demand in the state should average 6.6 Bcf per 
day, down only slightly from August's total of 6.8 Bcf per day. Flows into 
the state between August and September are not likely to change 
significantly, but price pressure should decline somewhat with demand. The 
Topock differential to the Henry Hub should average approximately $0.50 per 
MMBtu for September (see Table 7).
Storage inventories in the West are still healthy relative to levels in the 
rest of the United States, but the storage surplus in the region has eroded. 
In California, inventories are running lower than last year, and the deficit 
in the state looks likely to widen during September. The end of injection 
season storage inventories will determine the vulnerability of Topock 
differentials to winter price spikes.

Pacific Northwest
Malin prices this summer have shown neither the strong premiums that Topock 
prices have shown nor the wide discounts that supplies in the Rocky Mountains 
and San Juan Basins have shown. So far this month, prices at Malin are 
averaging a $0.25 per MMBtu discount to the Henry Hub. Pipeline capacity into 
the region from the Rocky Mountains is running nearly full; flows on PGT out 
of Alberta have averaged nearly 2.2 Bcf per day this month. Export capacity 
out of the region on PGE GT NW is running close to capacity, and pipeline 
constraints to the south combined with strong California demand are driving 
the wide Malin-to-Topock differentials.

Continuing strong demand in the South will likely keep Topock prices strong, 
and the wide north-south differentials within the West will likely hold 
through September. In the Pacific Northwest demand is expected to climb 
through September to 1.5 Bcf per day from 1.4 Bcf per day in August. This 
demand level should keep Malin differentials from widening from current 
levels. For September CERA expects Malin prices to average $0.10 per MMBtu 
below the Henry Hub price.

Southwest
Prices in the San Juan Basin this summer have been left behind by rising 
California demand. Although the westward pull on supplies is strong, 
bottlenecks between California and the San Juan have led to disconnects 
between San Juan prices and Topock prices. Pipeline capacity utilization 
rates on Transwestern and the northern leg of El Paso reached 93 percent 
during July, with less than 200 MMcf per day of excess pipeline capacity. 
Increased flows from the Rockies on TransColorado and Northwest are 
contributing to downward pressure on San Juan Basin supply, and in general, 
the San Juan has followed Rocky Mountain prices rather than following prices 
at Topock or the Permian Basin.

Unlike in the past two summers, the bottleneck has not allowed power demand 
on the West Coast to support San Juan prices relative to Permian prices. The 
differential between San Juan and Permian has averaged $0.50 per MMBtu so far 
this month and $0.30 per MMBtu since June. Additional imports from the 
Rockies into the San Juan have increased supply by 200 MMcf per day relative 
to last summer, but these higher flows do not fully explain the disconnect. 
Without much change in Southwestern or Rocky Mountains local demand, the San 
Juan should continue to price at a wide discount during September. The San 
Juan-to-Henry Hub differential is expected to average $0.60 per MMBtu. As in 
the Rockies, differentials should narrow substantially in October.

Rocky Mountains
Downward pressures on Rocky Mountain prices intensified over the past month 
as utilization rates on pipelines out of the region continued to climb. 
Record heat and power generation levels have done little to boost gas demand 
within the region; generation is still largely coal-based, and the demand 
impact on gas of the additional load is minimal. CERA expects the heavy 
discount-current Rocky Mountain-to-Henry Hub differentials are around $0.90 
per MMBtu-to persist through September. Local area demand is not expected to 
change during September. Substantial gain in local demand comes in October 
with heating loads; October demand should average 1.4 Bcf per day, up from 
August and September averages of around 1.2 Bcf per day.

Although the winter heating season will relieve pipeline pressures in the 
Rockies, winter differentials are expected to stay in the $0.25 to $0.40 per 
MMBtu range. Strong storage inventories will limit the connection with 
broader North American markets this summer. Next summer, pressures on Rockies 
supplies will likely intensify relative to this summer. Although pipeline 
expansion projects have been announced-Trailblazer and Williams announced 
expansion plans this summer-the new capacity will not be online to relieve 
constraints next summer. CERA expects supplies within the Rocky Mountains to 
increase by 300 MMcf per day next year.

Western Canada
After widening to over US$1.50 per MMBtu, the AECO-Henry differential has 
begun to narrow somewhat; maintenance that has restricted flows has largely 
been responsible for the jump from $0.84 per MMBtu in July. With current 
supply able to fill the contracted pipe capacity and incremental volumes 
having to pay full cost to flow, differentials are likely to persist in the 
mid-US$0.70s per MMBtu for September. AECO is expected to be US$3.25 per 
MMBtu (C$4.53 per gigajoule) for September. Even with the start-up of the 
Alliance project, the contract nonrenewal on TransCanada is likely to 
continue the two-tiered pricing dynamics of contracted versus uncontracted 
pipeline costs. This will result in differentials that will range between 
US$0.60 and US$0.75 per MMBtu throughout the winter.

Supply build in western Canada continues to languish behind last year's 
levels. The pace of drilling (over 9,000 gas wells are expected this year) 
should provide growth in the fourth quarter and into 2001. Supply is expected 
to be flat with 1999 on an annual basis for this year and up at least 350 
MMcf per day in 2001.

Sumas prices have been quite volatile, driven by both weather in the Pacific 
Northwest and maintenance on the Westcoast system. For September, Sumas is 
expected to be slightly more stable and to price at a modest premium to AECO 
of US$0.05 per MMBtu.

Summary:
The recently concluded 12th Session of the Subsidiary Bodies in Bonn, the 
next-to-last negotiating session before the details of the Kyoto Protocol are 
scheduled to be finalized in November, made little progress on key issues. 
But the meetings did serve to highlight divisions within the three 
negotiating blocks and identify the most contentious areas for future 
discussion.

Summary:
The retail energy industry and the Internet are becoming increasingly 
interlinked. The past 12 months have seen the formation of a wave of new 
retail energy businesses seeking ways to utilize the Internet to create a 
"new" retail energy industry. The difference is that this "new" industry will 
invert the energy supply chain and be built from the demand side (customer 
end) back upstream. This fosters a new role for customers and their 
relationship with suppliers, an expansion in the number and types of products 
and services being offered, and a change in the composition of the companies 
involved in this segment. In this Private Report we analyze these new 
entrants, their business models, and the prospects for success in what to 
date has been a difficult marketplace.

Summary:
The last remaining obstacle to the Blue Stream gas pipeline project between 
Russia and Turkey appears about to be cleared away. Over the past two days 
the Turkish parliament has been debating a key tax protocol connected to the 
project. CERA believes the measure is very close to passage, as the Turkish 
governing coalition has successfully resolved its internal differences over 
Blue Stream.

Summary:
The proposed directive on renewables issued by the European Commission on May 
10 may appear to be a weak compromise between widely divergent interests. 
Rather, CERA sees the proposal as a potentially important building block for 
a competitive market in renewable energy sources; the establishment of a 
method for guaranteeing a renewable origin for energy lays the foundation for 
green energy markets in the medium term.

Summary:
Colombia is expected to begin an economic recovery in 2000 after a 
contraction of over 5 percent in 1999. Despite this expansion, unemployment 
levels will remain stable at 19 percent, and losses incurred by companies, by 
individuals, and by the government through lower tax revenues during the last 
nine quarters of negative economic growth will not be recovered this year. 
The administration of Andr,s Pastrana Arango faces the difficult challenge of 
getting the economy back in shape at a time when his popularity is waning.

Summary:
The opening of Brazil's upstream oil sector has taken another step forward 
this week following the successful ANP auction of 21 blocks. This bidding 
round comes one year after ANP's first round, held in June 1999. The bid was 
well subscribed by 44 companies that were qualified to participate and bid 
for the 10 onshore and 13 offshore blocks throughout nine basins in Brazil. 
Although the ANP collected lower participation fees than in the first round 
(US$9.0 million compared with US$9.8 million in the first round), the second 
round was generally considered a success.

Title: Brazilian Power Markets: Demand Recovery Gathers Steam but Supply 
Questions Remain
Author: Bailey, Mattos
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: Latin American Energy
URL:
http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/la/alt/061600_17/la_alt_061600_17_ab.html

Summary:
Brazil's power demand grew rapidly throughout the first quarter of 2000. 
February demand was 6.8 percent over February 1999 levels, and March demand 
grew a further 7.6 percent above the previous year. The industrial sector 
continued to lead the recovery with year-to-date demand growing 9.8 percent 
over 1999, and commercial sector demand growth remained strong at 7.5 percent 
over a similar period. As demand growth strengthened, hydro power generation 
increased while thermal generation levels declined steadily from a peak in 
January. Hydro stored energy levels had begun to decline in all regions by 
the end of April, signaling the end of the wet season. With rapidly 
increasing demand, particularly in the South and Southeast regions, Brazil 
could experience power shortages during the coming dry season if capacity 
additions that are currently scheduled to come online in the next several 
months are delayed.

Summary:
For the first time in many decades, the presidential and parliamentary 
campaigns are highly competitive, and the results of these democratically 
conducted elections will have a large impact on the effectiveness and future 
of the new administration. However, the real political battle begins after 
the elections. Indeed, the winning party will have to exercise all its 
political skills to create coalitions and advance negotiations in order to 
take control of the government. Three different scenarios are portrayed in 
this CERA Decision Brief.

Summary:
July 2000 marks the second anniversary of the widely publicized visit of then 
President-elect Andres Pastrana to elderly guerilla chief of the Armed 
Revolutionary Forces of Colombia (FARC), Manuel Marulanda. Two years later, 
the country is no closer to peace, and resolution of the ongoing negotiations 
is uncertain at best. This prolongation and stagnation of the peace process 
has had a direct negative impact on energy sector investment in Colombia. The 
government will likely proceed with formal negotiations, but time--and 
Pastrana's remaining term in office--is running out.

http://www.cera.com/client/la/alt/063000_16/la_alt_063000_16_ab.html

Summary:
Prices in the Argentine power market were significantly higher in May owing 
to the combination of continued low hydro output, strong demand growth, and 
periodic constraints on natural gas deliveries to power plants in the Buenos 
Aires region. Spot power prices (energy component only) averaged $18.24 per 
megawatt-hour (MWh) in May. Although average power prices declined from last 
year, price volatility increased, with several short-duration episodes of 
prices over $60 per MWh as gas unavailability in the Buenos Aires region 
forced several midcost units offline during peak hours. In June, prices are 
expected to continue strengthening to the $24-$28 per MWh range on average. 
Beyond June, price pressures are expected to remain negative as increasing 
hydro output, new and returning low-cost thermal capacity, and the end of gas 
constraints push average prices back toward $15 per MWh or below by August or 
September.

Summary:
The US gas market enters the month of June with prices at the highest level 
since deregulation. At the Henry Hub prices have surged to as high as $4.50 
per MMBtu--up from less than $3.00 per MMBtu during April. Behind this has 
been a building and serious shortfall of supply, the result of disappointing 
gas production levels and surging gas demand for power generation. The gap 
between these two forces has been met through storage inventories, with 
injections so far this spring running between 1.5 and 2.0 Bcf per day below 
last year's rate. The continued tension between these two forces will keep 
the pressure on prices this summer, and the need to inject gas into storage 
will price out increments of demand.

Summary:
Pressure remains extremely strong in the United States gas market as three 
factors--the increasing power generation demand, lower storage inventories, 
and US wellhead supply still struggling to rebound--call into question the 
ability to build storage to a level adequate for next winter. Prices are 
being supported also by concurrent strength in oil and liquids markets, 
making traditional alternatives to gas much more expensive than in recent 
years. In this environment intense competition between power generation 
demand and storage injections will continue throughout the summer--with 
pressure increasing into July as temperatures rise--with the result that gas 
will continue to price at the high levels necessary to discourage end-use 
demand. CERA expects a July average price of $4.45 per MMBtu.

E-Mail Category: Decision Brief
Product Line: North American Gas
URL:
http://www.cera.com/client/nag/db/061500_18/nag_db_061500_18_ab.html

Summary:
As US supply declines and demand grows, current high gas prices are 
reinforced, but western Canadian gas supply growth appears to be faltering 
when it is needed most. Both transitory factors and enduring trends underlie 
the disappointing production growth results. The largely weather-related 
transitory factors have had a near-term impact on drilling and connection 
activity. The underlying trends have been developing slowly over time. More 
shallow gas wells have been drilled in the past three to four years and 
created a shift to higher average basin declines and lower average per well 
production rates. Thus more shallow wells are needed just to replace 
production. With a shift to more exploration and deeper drilling, higher 
supply growth rates are possible, but if that does not occur, other potential 
supply sources may step in. Significant Arctic reserves in the McKenzie Delta 
and the Alaskan North Slope are once again entering the spotlight. Coal bed 
methane has become a str!
ong source of US supply. Although now ignored in Canada, it may become a 
future source of Canadian gas.

http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/nag/wch/061600_11/nag_wch_061600_11_ab.html

Summary:
Fundamentals have taken center stage, as building demand pressure accompanies 
US supply declines. Storage inventories have been significantly reduced, and 
the pressure for storage injections is likely to intensify as we head into 
the summer months. Demand-driven growth continues, as completions of 
gas-fired power generation plants accelerate to a pace above 10,000 megawatts 
per year and economic growth stimulates electricity demand. The result is a 
higher-price playing field for natural gas, with the average Henry Hub price 
likely to reach $3.67 per MMBtu for 2000--its highest level since the 
development of spot markets.

Title: Closing the Utility Stock Valuation Gap: Does Strategy Matter?

Summary:
The stock market has been delivering an unsettling message to the utility 
industry. Traditionally undervalued in the market, the sector is trading at a 
historically wide 50 percent discount to Standard and Poor's S&P 500. The S&P 
Utility Index over the past 18 months gained only 5 percent, with huge gains 
by some energy companies offset by a 15 percent drop in stock price for 29 
electric utilities. Yet early this year, the SPU outpaced all other industry 
groups. How should constantly evolving utilities in this wide-open sector 
form a strategic plan to maximize shareholder value while achieving success? 
The value of electric utility merger and acquisition deals for 1999--a record 
$50 billion--was double the 1998 value. But are these choices ahead of the 
curve? And when will the market catch up? Three groups of new companies with 
distinctive strategies may provide clues to the new strategic landscape: 
multiservice and technology providers, superregionals, and global power and !
energy companies. Three other strategic choices are considered in evaluating 
responses to these challenges.

Summary:
While several regional power markets are likely to see a repeat of price 
spikes this summer, other markets are likely to see a reversal in price 
volatility as supply-demand balances improve dramatically. One way to 
interpret forward markets is as a consensus of market expectations. 
Therefore, forward prices for on-peak wholesale power reflect the common 
expectation that prices will spike as high as--or even higher than--in 1999. 
A significant disconnect exists between the forward market prices and market 
fundamentals for the upcoming summer in some regional markets.

Title: Atlantic Basin Gasoline Markets Soar

Product Line: Refined Products

Summary:
Spurred by supply concerns at the start of the summer driving season, spot 
gasoline-to-crude oil price differentials on both sides of the north Atlantic 
have soared to the highest levels seen since the Gulf War. In CERA's view, 
this strength in margins is attributable to the convergence of three factors: 
very low inventories, tightening gasoline specifications, and legal 
uncertainty.

Summary:
The US gasoline market exhibited exceptional strength during May. US Gulf 
Coast unleaded gasoline surged to $8.40 per barrel measured against WTI, up 
$3.58 per barrel over the strong April value of $4.82. Apparent demand for 
gasoline skyrocketed to 8.64 million barrels per day (mbd) in response to the 
start of the summer driving season. Despite increases in the reported demand 
for distillate and jet/kerosene, these markets did not experience the same 
month-over-month strength in differentials, dropping to $1.58 and $2.58 per 
barrel versus WTI, respectively.

Summary:
As higher crude oil prices started to reduce the high product differentials 
to Brent and thus lower refinery margins, refiners attempted to prevent this 
situation from worsening by reducing throughputs. However, very tight markets 
for gasoline and to a lesser extent for automotive diesel helped to limit the 
fall in those products' values. Meanwhile, fuel oil discounts to crude oil 
widened in May, driving down simple/hydroskimming margins.

In recent weeks, the combination of lower primary products inventories and 
reductions in operations at some refineries has helped differentials to 
recover. This has pushed margins to above May's averages, although still 
below April's peaks.

Summary:
The close scrutiny that federal reformulated gasoline (RFG) now faces from 
the media and public officials owing to Midwestern market price spikes has 
not stopped the inexorable political progress toward eliminating methyl 
tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) use in the US gasoline pool. Additional 
signposts, including heightened congressional debate over legislation 
eliminating MTBE use and state actions to ban MTBE, continue to emerge that 
point the way toward MTBE-free gasoline in the United States.

Summary:
Refined products markets continue to display marked regional differences. In 
the Atlantic Basin, low gasoline inventories in both the United States and 
Europe, which resulted from many months of OPEC production restraint, 
continue to dominate the market, and gasoline differentials above crude are 
at their highest level in over ten years. Although signs are emerging of a 
possible correction in the North American market in the coming month, the 
2000 gasoline season will almost certainly be the strongest experienced by 
Atlantic Basin refiners in many years. In contrast, Asia Pacific spot 
refining margins were weak through most of June, until the recent accident at 
KPC's Mina al-Ahmadhi refinery prompted a quick strengthening in prompt 
Singapore margins. However, with ample unused refining capacity available 
east of Suez and the likelihood of a partial restart of the KPC refinery in 
July, CERA's outlook is for that strength to be of short duration.

Title: New Peaks, New Prices

Product Line: Western Energy

http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/ce/alt/062300_17/ce_alt_062300_17_ab.html

Summary:
In the West, July typically marks the start of the summer cooling season and 
steadily rising power prices. CERA expect the West to be the only region in 
North America with a year-over-year increase in peak electricity demand. 
Power prices already established new record highs in June, suggesting that as 
demand reaches its peak in the coming months western power markets will 
continue to experience increased volatility compared with last year's levels. 
The convergence of higher gas prices, growing power demand, and reduced 
hydroelectric energy production compared with 1999 levels is pushing up 
western power prices. Greater utilization of gas-fired generators within the 
West has supported western differentials and contributed to high gas prices 
throughout North America. Western gas prices should continue to be strong, 
boosted by continuing increases in regional gas demand for power generation 
and pressure across North America to inject gas into storage in anticipation 
of summer !
power loads.

Summary:
Driven by strong demand--especially in the recovering Asian economies and the 
United States--oil prices (both WTI and Brent) have again broken the $30 
level--a mark that is of particular significance in this US election year. In 
turn, the oil market's attention is again fixed on OPEC, as it prepares for 
its June 21 meeting, but its members are deeply divided over how to respond.

Summary:
The key ingredient in the volatile oil market is the new OPEC--and its 
successful implementation of a strategy to keep supply one half step behind 
demand-driving inventories down for crude, with the side effect of lowering 
stocks for several products in markets such as the United States and Europe. 
Three features of the current oil market are supporting prices:
* Market supported
* Psychology enhanced
* OPEC driven

Summary:
OPEC's agreement to raise its production quota beginning July 1 by 708,000 
barrels per day to 25.4 million barrels per day is consistent with its 
strategy of restraining supply to maintain oil inventories at relatively low 
levels. The gain in supply is a short-term fix meant to alleviate political 
pressure for increased production and to push prices below $30 but keep them 
in a mid- to upper $20s range.

Subject: Prelimiinary Comments on Transport Option Program


Lorraine,

Below are some very preliminary regulatory issues that I have identified
regarding Transwestern's
Transport Option Program.  These concerns may not constitute all of our
concerns; I'm sure there will be more as we continue to review this proposal
with our commercial people.  Also, they have not been reviewed with
management, and may, or may not, represent the ultimate positions that
Conoco (or the Indicated Shipper Trial Group) takes in any proceeding before
the FERC.

Thanks again for inviting us to lunch yesterday.  Both Teddy and I found it
to be very helpful and informative.  We look forward to a more detailed
description of your proposal, and the ability to discuss it with
Transwestern in a future customer meeting.  Please forward this e-mail on to
Jeff; I don't have his direct e-mail address.

Tentative Regulatory Issues regarding Transwestern's Transport Option
Program ("TOP").

1. Market Based Rates.  To the extent that TW intends to offer the TOP
service without a corresponding cost based recourse service, under current
FERC policy, TW would need to make a filing that demonstrates a lack of
market power.
2. Comparable Service:  To the extent that TW implements a TOP service,
it would be highly advisable to provide that other FT holders be able to
offer a similar call & put capability in the capacity release market.  As I
remember TW's tariffs, this would likely require specific changes to the
capacity release sections in order to allow prospective capacity releases
with a call or put pricing option.
3. Hoarding:  The TOP service should not be a means for any party
(particularly an affiliate) to manipulate the transportation market and/or
to exert market power by withholding capacity.
4. Reliability:  The TOP service should require sufficient protections
to ensure continued, undiminished service to all of TW's existing and future
FT customers.
5. Standardized Product:  The terms and conditions for the TOP service
should be standardized in order that each TOP service offer is not
considered a "non-conforming" contract under FERC policy.  The call and put
options, and any administrative or operating limitations, should be
specifically defined.
6. Non-preferential Service:  TW must ensure that the TOP service is
offered and administered in a manner that is fair and equitable, and in a
manner that does not convey a preferential right to any party (particularly
an affiliate).
7. Revenue:  Regardless of whether the TOP is a cost or market based
rate, there will be a question as to where the revenue goes.
8. Pilot Program.  Given the precedential nature of this proposal,
perhaps the industry would be more comfortable with the TOP if it were filed
as an experimental program on TW, with a finite life.  This would allow
parties to gain experience prior to having all of the Enron pipelines (and
others) file for similar authority.

Thanks again.

Gina, this one is going to   Enron Transportation Services - Houston



I want to take a moment to say "thank you" to all the employees who 
participated in the ETS Food & Toy Drive. We delivered over 10 boxes of food 
and toys on Friday to the Downtown location of the Head Start program.

There are many people in the Houston community who need our help and support, 
especially during the Holiday Season.  Through your kindness, the Head Start 
Program, ETS' adopted United Way agency,  will be able to help those less 
fortunate.

The pictures below capture some of our employees displaying the donations 
that were collected in the Enron building.  The collections in Three Allen 
Center were significant as well.   

Thank you, again, for your overwhelming generosity.

Breaking News : Phased MarketLink Project, Questar Expansion Approved 
posted 10:50 AM (CST) Dec 13, 2000 

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has authorized Transcontinental Gas 
Pipe Line (Transco) to phase in construction of its 700 MMcf/d MarketLink 
project, which would expand its Leidy Line from western Pennsylvania to 
markets in New Jersey and New York.

Phase I of MarketLink would add 166,000 Dth/d of new firm capacity on Transco 
to serve five shippers beginning Nov. 1, 2001. Phase II would add 130,000 
Dth/d to serve two shippers by Nov. 1 2002. FERC denied requests by the state 
of New Jersey and the state's Department of Law and Public Safety to rescind 
and vacate an April certificate approving construction of the entire 
MarketLink project. However, the Commission is requiring Transco to file 
executed contracts fully subscribing the remaining capacity within four 
months of the order. If the contracts are not filed, Transco can not initiate 
eminent domain proceedings with respect to the remaining facilities covered 
by the original certificate.

The Commission also granted Questar a preliminary determination on 
non-environmental grounds, saying its proposed Mainline 104 looping project 
and interconnection with Kern River Pipeline is required by the public. The 
$80.8 million Questar project would add 272,000 Dth/d of capacity. M.L. 104 
would run from coal-seam reserves in the Uinta Basin near Price, UT, to the 
Payson Citygate and the connection with Kern River. The project would loop a 
portion of Questar's M.L. No. 40 and the entire M.L. No. 41. Both lines 
currently are running full.

As you are painfully aware, we had a power outage Wednesday morning in the 
Enron Building.  This outage was caused by localized structural failure of 
the raised floor in our 34th floor Data Center.  This resulted in disruption 
to the power distribution system servicing the phone switch and a number of 
ENA servers.

As a cautionary move, Enron OnLine was interrupted while the extent of the 
failure was assessed, resulting in the system being unavailable from 11:23 to 
11:39.  All Enron Building telephones and voicemail were unavailable for 
approximately one hour and 20 minutes and certain ENA trading systems were 
unavailable for over two hours.  During this time the power was stabilized 
and systems were restored.  Immediate steps are being taken to correct this 
problem. 

We apologize for this inconvenience.

If you have any questions in regard to this outage, please call Philippe Bibi 
at x37698 or Bill Donovan at x35459

Texans Bake as Electricity Usage Hits Record

By today, a "cool" spell was expected to grip Texas, plunging temperatures 
down to around 100. A nice respite from the 105-plus temperatures that 
stilled the state and sent electricity peak loads to new records last week 
for the third time this year. 

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), an industry coalition that 
administers the state's power grid and serves 85% of the state's electric 
load, reported Friday that preliminary numbers indicated that electricity 
usage reached an all-time peak high for the third time in 44 days last 
Thursday, with Texans using 57,731 MW of power. Of course, that was before 
the weekend, when temperatures were expected to climb as high as 112 at some 
locations in the state --- just in time for Labor Day picnics. 

The new usage record last Thursday broke the previous record set the day 
before, on Wednesday, when consumers used 55,994 MW of power. The two broken 
records broke a record set just six weeks earlier, July 19, when Texans used 
55,796 MW of power. 

Peak load in August 1999 was 54,849 MW of power, while peak load in August 
1998 was 53,689 MW of power.

FPLs shares lower because of disappointment that FPL was not the
takeover target. The combined company will have 6.3 million customers
and 48,000 MW of power generating capacity. FPL supplies electric
service to about 3.8 million customers throughout Florida. Entergy
delivers electricity to about 2.5 million customers in parts of
Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. The deal, a $27 billion
merger, which included their combined market value of $16.4 billion,
$6.9 billion of Entergy debt and $3.8 billion of FPL debt. FPL
shareholders will own 57% of the new company and Entergys 43%. The
board of directors will be made up of 8 FPL members and 7 Entergy
members. To support the deal, FPL and Entergy plan to buy back a
total of $1 billion in stock, $570 million in FPL stock and $430
million in Entergy stock. FPL shareholders will receive one share in
the new company for each of FPLs 170.5 million diluted shares
outstanding. Entergy shareholders would receive 0.585 share in the
new company for each of their 228.1 million diluted shares
outstanding. Shares of FPL fell more than 8%, to 48-1/4 and Entergy
shares fell more than 10% to 27-1/4 yesterday afternoon. Based on
FPLs price on Monday morning, the deal values Entergy at about $28.33
per share. Many had speculated FPL was to be bought rather than be
involved in a merger. The merger agreement includes a $200 million
break-up fee in case either side terminates the deal. The merger of
FPL and Entergy must be cleared by shareholders as well as federal
regulators and was expected to close next year. The combined company
expects to pay a dividend that is consistent with FPLs current
dividend policy. Based on its current annual dividend of $2.16 per
share, Entergys shareholders would receive $1.26 per share compared
with its current dividend of $1.20 per share. FPLs Broadhead will
become the chairman and Entergy Chief Executive Leonard will become
chief executive of the new company. The expected annual cost savings
and increased revenues for both competitive and regulated businesses
may range from $150 million to $275 million, with about half the cost
savings to come from work force reductions, mainly through attrition,
growth and voluntary retirement.

Note:  CERA gives a storage prediction for end of withdrawal season under a 
normal winter.

**********************************************************************
CERA Alert: Sent Fri, November 10, 2000

Title: Taking up the Slack
Author: N. American Gas Team
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: North American Gas ,
URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1415 ,

Alternative URL: 
http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/111000_11/nag_alt_111000_11_ab.html

Cold weather in the Midwest and reduced storage
injections have taken up much of the temporary slack
that developed in the gas market during the warm
October. As expected, prices have responded quickly to
the cold, with the December futures contract price
advancing by over $0.75 per million British thermal
units (MMBtu) in the past week. As cold weather
develops, late winter supply availability is still
uncertain in CERA's view. For that reason, dual-fuel
markets must remain off of gas, and market fundamentals
support the recent price rebound, which places gas
prices again at a premium to resid.

CERA estimates that US working storage inventories as of
the end of October were approximately 2,746 billion
cubic feet (Bcf), an all-time low for that date by 64
Bcf (see table below). Storage injections of 36 Bcf for
the week ending November 3 were higher than a normal
weather pattern would indicate, but more normal weather
for the remainder of the month would result in
withdrawals averaging 3.5 Bcf per day during November.
This withdrawal rate is moderate by historical standards
but 2.5 Bcf per day higher than occurred in the past two
years (see table below). This pace of withdrawals places
inventories on a path toward an end-of-March minimum of
771 Bcf under normal winter weather conditions, only 13
Bcf above the previous all-time low.

This market remains tight. Although added supplies will
begin to help by the end of the winter, for now some
demand must still be priced out of the market in order
to preserve storage inventories.

This project, of all that have been proposed recently, probably has a better 
chance of success.  First, Mission Energy is already a huge player in the 
IPP/Cogen business in Kern County, and is regarded as fairly skilled at 
getting permits/authorizations through the system.  Their existing facilites 
on Texaco's leases currently produce over 1,000 MW of power.  Secondly, this 
project would sit smack dab in the middle of the Midway-Sunset field and is 
easily accessible off the West Side Lateral of Kern/Mojave's system.  As 
such, they are probably a prime candidate for either Phase I or Phase II of 
Kern River's expansion.  Also, realize that Texaco has a substantial amount 
of field area [associated oil] gas, so, depending on the structure of the 
Texaco - Mission Energy sales agreement, Mission probably has access to or 
call on this Texaco production (i.e., they have the perfect physical hedge).

Kern would seem to be the "pipeline of choice" here... particularly, when you 
consider the impact of the reduced rates under their proposed expansion.  
Without the direct connection into Kern County, TW would have a difficult 
time competing.   Also, keep an eye out for El Paso moving forward with 
commercial plans for the California leg of All American Pipeline.  A large 
end-use plant like this could be the basis for an "En-Rate" type transport 
program on El Paso-All American, particularly if they get their allocation 
problems resolved at FERC.

Edison Mission Energy to build power plant in California

Edison Mission Energy, an Edison International company, is purchasing the
rights to the Sunrise Power Project from Texaco Power and Gasification. A
proposed power generation facility to be located in Kern County, Calif., the
project will bring both short- and long-term generation capacity to the
state, which is in dire need of new power generation.

The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases. Phase 1 will
consist of a 320-MW, simple-cycle peaking facility scheduled to be in
service during the summer of 2001. Phase 2 will convert the peaking facility
to a 560-MW, combined-cycle operation with an in-service date of summer
2003.

Final regulatory approvals should be received shortly for Phase I of the
project. Edison Mission Energy plans to seek expedited permitting approval
for the Phase II expansion in line with the fast-track approvals process
recently enacted by the California legislature.

Edison Mission Energy specializes in the development, acquisition,
construction management and operation of global power production facilities.
The company owns nearly 23,000 MW of generating capacity, including
interests in 75 projects currently under construction or operating in
Australia, Indonesia, Italy, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Spain, Thailand,
Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Kim,

Here's the November Park and Ride activity with it's associated rates and 
revenues.  You might find some opportunities here to use the TW Deal Analysis 
tool.  Maybe its Morgan or TK Lohmann who could use this tool to set P&R 
rates to ensure we cover the varialble O&M costs.  As you can see there's not 
much revenue associated with P&R during the course of the month so the impact 
on linepack and fuel use has the potential to exceed the benefits.

Thanks........Terry

Hello everyone!  As the United Way campaign gets kicked-off this year for 
Enron, I volunteered to be a team leader to help out with the campaign.  The 
big kick-off for Enron is tomorrow, Wednesday, August 9 at 11:15 at the Hyatt 
Regency.  GPG will be participating in a round of Enron's own game show, "Who 
Wants to Help Millions for United Way?".  To show our support for GPG's game 
show contestant and the United Way, Please join Stan Horton and your GPG 
co-workers at 11:00am at the wheelchair ramp on the Andrews side of the Enron 
Building to walk to the Hyatt together.  Dress casual and wear a BLUE shirt 
to represent GPG proudly!

Also, mark your calendar for Monday, August 21 at 3:00pm in the Energizer for 
the GPG rally.

Enron has added an on-line pledging feature to the United Way campaign this 
year.  No more pledge cards to pass around!  I have seen a demo of the system 
and I must say it makes turning in your pledge very easy!  You will learn 
more about this tomorrow!  

Please plan to attend the Enron rally tomorrow!  I am available to provide 
you additional information about United Way or help answer any questions you 
may have about Enron's participation in the campaign so please don't hesitate 
to call me at Ext. 33098.  I look forward to seeing you there!  

Thanks, Kim Watson.

FYI...I spoke with Craig Carley at Reliant this morning.  On contract #22538, 
there was not a discount requested therefore September was at Max Rate.  For 
October, I told him the spreads are still above Max Rate and he is in 
agreement.  November...hmmm...above Max Rate?!?!

Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31.   Commercial 
and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral, 
Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended.  After a brief overview of the 
proposed filing, TW opened the floor for questions and comments.  Here is a 
summary of the comments.

Marketing affiliate concerns.  BP's regulatory representative expressed 
concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game 
the system.  In BP's example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, ENA 
could purchase an "out of the money" call option essentially cost free, since 
its affiliate (TW) would have the ability to buy the option back.  Proceeds 
from ENA's ability to then "move the market" through the establishment of the 
long basis position would go directly to Enron's bottom line.  BP suggested 
that TW's marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the 
marketing affiliate be required to credit 100% of the option proceeds to 
other shippers.  Although BP admits that Transwestern's prior dealings with 
ENA have not been suspect, BP fears that TW's filing will set a precedent for 
other pipelines to offer a similar service.  Since TW will be the first 
pipeline to offer such services, BP wants TW's program to be as restricted as 
possible.  Dynegy echoed BP's concern regarding possible affiliate abuse, but 
rather than shelve the program entirely, Dynegy reiterated an earlier 
suggestion that Transwestern be required to credit back the difference 
between the option fee paid by an affiliate and the next highest bidder, if 
the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest by a certain percentage.  

TW's response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a 
marketing affiliate may be a legitimate concern, owing to its unassailable 
record in this area, TW should be entitled to a presumption that it has 
complied and will continue to comply with Commission policy covering the sale 
of capacity to marketing affiliates, and was not inclined to voluntarily 
include any limitations on the options program.  If BP and others have 
serious concerns regarding the Commission's overall policy on marketing 
affiliates, those issues should be raised in a separate proceeding that 
applies to all interstate pipelines.

Right of first refusal.  Burlington asked whether options would replace the 
right of first refusal.  TW's  response was that ROFR will still be available 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.

Negotiated rate.  BP's representative claimed that option contracts will 
constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as 
such.  TW did not respond to this or discuss it further.  However, TW's 
position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the 
transportation rate, transportation deals that include the option amendment 
will only be considered negotiated rate deals if the total rate including the 
option fee exceeds the maximum transport rate.  

Hoarding capacity.  Using the recent large block sale of capacity on El Paso 
as an example, several customers expressed concern that the options program 
would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not clear why 
some of the workshop participants thought that the sale of options would 
create more opportunity for hoarding capacity than already exists.  Perhaps 
because the option fee is a lesser cost than the transport rate for the 
underlying capacity, their perception was that options would simply make 
hoarding cheaper and easier.  TW acknowledged that the potential for 
withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy 
against reserving capacity for shippers.  Although TW did not commit to 
placing any limits on the either the quantity of capacity or options for 
capacity that any one shipper may own, it is possible that FERC may require 
TW to do so in a final order.

Our plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California the week of 
September 11 to go over details of the program, and to finalize the FERC 
filing by mid-September.

*UtiliCorp Wants To Spin Off Aquila
Kansas City Business Journal =01) 09/29/2000
By Brian Cookson

UtiliCorp United Inc. wants to parlay the rapid growth of its Aquila Energy=
=20
subsidiary into a piece of a new, larger Aquila.

The Kansas City-based utility has plans to spin off Aquila, possibly=20
retaining ownership of a third of it, selling another third to a partner an=
d=20
offering the remainder in the stock market.  The move could allow Aquila, n=
ow=20
engaged primarily in trading power and natural gas, to gain more hard asset=
s=20
of its own and seek higher valuation from investors.

=01&We really think the value of our company is much higher than the market=
=20
currently values it because it values it as a utility,=018 Aquila spokesman=
 Al=20
Butkus said.

Aquila, which moved its headquarters to Kansas City last year, has been the=
=20
engine behind earnings growth for UtiliCorp.  For the second quarter of thi=
s=20
year, Aquila reported earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $49.5=20
million, up 113 percent from the previous year.  UtiliCorp as a whole had=
=20
EBIT of $103.9 million for the second quarter of 2000.

Aquila may be able to attract more interest because it wouldn=01,t carry th=

Richard Stuebi, president of Next Wave Energy, agreed.  The head of the=20

=01&In general, the stock market prefers companies that are clean or pure=

Aquila=01,s strategy comes as little surprise to Stuebi.  As much success a=

company has had, he said he thought Aquila would need to get bigger to=20
compete.

=01&In most aspects of the energy business, the race for scale is on,=018 h=

Aquila also could increase its value to shareholders by looking for hard=20
assets to match its marketing prowess.  Aquila CEO Keith Stamm said the=20
company could address this need by building, such as the new electric=20
generation plant it is building in Pleasant Hill.  It also could buy=20
generation capacity or take on a partner with electric generation capacity.

Stamm said the company is looking for such a partner but is keeping the oth=

Stamm said that Aquila has talked to several companies and that an=20
announcement could come by the end of the year.

The timing of any initial public stock offering would be dependent on the=

Butkus said UtiliCorp isn=01,t sacrificing its hold on Aquila.  Instead,=20
executives are hoping to own part of an infinitely more valuable company.

Aquila already is moving to enter a new market =01) trading bandwidth, or=

Traders in the bandwidth market could include telecom companies or Internet=

Last month you received an email about enrolling in the Enron PAC.  The=20
response has been positive. =20
Thank you to those of you that have already enrolled or made a change to yo=
ur=20
current contribution! =20
If you have not had an opportunity to visit the enrollment site, please=20
consider taking a moment to do so.  The link to the website is at the end o=
f=20
this message.

 Some of you may have experienced problems launching the site or enrolling.=
 =20
We apologize for any trouble that you may have had.  The enrollment works=
=20
best in either Internet Explorer or Netscape.  The most frequent problems=
=20
were a result of the Lotus Notes web browser that many employees have=20
installed as a default browser.  If this is your case, please copy and past=
e=20
the link at the end of this message into either Internet Explorer or Netsca=
pe.

As a reminder - Following is the original message regarding the PAC=20
enrollment:

Last year the Enron Political Action Committee (PAC) launched a campaign to=
=20
become a "million dollar PAC".  Enron employees, who provide all of the=20
funding for the PAC, responded and the Enron PAC reached its objective,=20
becoming one of the largest corporate PACs.  This year we face a new=20
challenge.  With the sale of EOG, the announced sale of PGE and normal=20
employee turnover, we have lost a significant number of consistent=20
contributors.  We are seeking your support.  If you are not a member, pleas=
e=20
join.  If you are a member, we hope you will consider increasing your=20
contribution.

The Enron PAC is an essential tool in our effort to promote sound public=20
policy.  Our PAC funds support local, state and federal candidates, of both=
=20
parties, who support open markets, deregulation and customer choice.  Amoun=
ts=20
contributed may be used to make political contributions in connection with=
=20
federal and state elections and are subject to the limits of the Federal=20
Election Campaign Act.  While our PAC has grown thanks to our employee=20
contributions, it still generates just a fraction of the expenditures of=20
those who oppose these ideals.

This year, as always, we face challenges and opportunities for every one of=
=20
our businesses, including such issues as taxation and regulation of=20
e-commerce, electric industry restructuring, regulation of derivatives,=20
international trade and investment legislation, pipeline safety, local and=
=20
state decisions affecting the siting and interconnection of power plants an=
d=20
a variety of environmental and tax issues.  Enron has a long and successful=
=20
track record of supporting and advancing good public policy.  That track=20
record depends on access to and regular communication with, decision makers=
. =20
The PAC provides that access - - it shows policy makers that real voters ca=
re=20
about what they are doing.

One of the best things about Enron is that we don=01,t just take things as =
they=20
are.  We challenge the status quo.  We ask why.  We change things.  The PAC=
=20
helps us do that.  We need you to help the PAC.  Sign up today =01) and ple=
ase=20
consider the following contribution guidelines:

Manager    $500/year
Director     $750/year
Sr. Director/General Manager  $1,000/year
Vice President    $2,500/year
Sr. VP/Managing Director  $3,500/year
Executive Committee   $5,000/year

All contributions are voluntary and these guidelines are merely suggestions=
. =20
You are free to contribute more or less than the guidelines suggested and=
=20
Enron will not favor or disadvantage anyone by reason of the amount of thei=
r=20
contribution or their decision not to contribute.  You may refuse to=20
contribute without fear of reprisal.

Only U.S. citizens and resident-aliens living in the U.S. can contribute to=
=20
the Enron PAC.  Amounts contributed may be used to make contributions in=20
connection with federal and state elections and are subject to the=20
limitations of the Federal Election Campaign Act.  The maximum contribution=
=20
is $5,000 per year per individual.  An individual may not contribute more=
=20
than $25,000 to all federal candidates and committees within a calendar=20
year.  The law requires that Enron report name, address, employer and=20
occupation for every person who contributes over $200/year.

No portion of any contribution is deductible as a charitable contribution f=
or=20
federal income tax purposes.

Thanks for your support!  Sign up now, or revise your current contribution=
=20
level by connecting with the PAC intranet site:

Sorry about my incomplete memo (I hit send instead of save).

Anyway, we would like to set-up a two hour meeting for Thursday, August 3rd 
to discuss the variables for modeling westward throughput on TW (to forecast 
fuel).  This will be a brainstorming session to discuss the various impacts 
on the level of throughput, such as, hydro levels, weather, prices, 
seasonality, etc.  Please let me know if morning or afternoon on the 3rd is 
good for you.

Thanks,

That's right; the dot is coming.  Prepare to be enlightened, entertained and 
engaged.  Prepare to receive information online that is so current, your 
mouse will be hiding under its mousepad.  Prepare to enter a brave new world 
of communication at Enron.  A world in which news is delivered so quickly you 
just might not be able to keep up.

A world in which we can rest easy that the information we need will be 
delivered with the speed and efficiency the Most Innovative Company in 
America deserves.

The dot is coming.  And it's bringing news you can use.  Now.

Note:  Ken Lay's comments at the "Governors' Natural Gas Summit:  Responding 
to the Growing Energy Crisis" are quoted in this article.

Industry Fears Consumer Backlash Because of High Prices 

The natural gas industry should be prepared to face customer revolts and 
attempts at price caps, similar to those witnessed this summer in San Diego 
if it's a cold winter and prices continue to hit new highs. That was the 
warning from government and industry representatives at the crisis conference 
held by the Interstate Oil & Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC) yesterday. 

Representatives of producing states and industry speakers were unanimous in 
opposing government intervention to restrain prices, but no one had a ready 
remedy for consumer reaction if they are hit with a double whammy of greater 
energy use at higher prices this winter. One speaker offered a bright spot: 
the industry might emerge relatively unscathed if the winter is moderate. But 
then he added it's not just residential heating bills, but electric bills as 
well that will be impacted by higher natural gas prices. Others pointed out 
that demand and higher prices could spur lawmakers to open more areas to 
drilling and encourage new long lines. 

"Industrial customers have been dealing with high prices for some time, but 
higher bills for residential and small commercial customers are just starting 
to hit the radar screen," Peggy Claytor, purchasing manager for steel-maker 
The Timken Co., told the group of more than 300 from the U.S., Canada and 
Mexico, meeting in Columbus, OH. "We may see protests or proposals or calls 
for price caps this winter." She said she is opposed to caps because they 
fail to solve the underlying problems, and she blamed the "dysfunctional 
electricity grid" in part for aggravating the run-up in natural gas prices. 

Asked whether he expected to see a public outcry from residentials this 
winter, Stephen L. Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, whose San Diego Gas & 
Electric subsidiary has borne the brunt of the California debacle (and whose 
prices were capped), had a one word answer: "Absolutely." 

Enron Chairman Ken Lay agreed. "If we have a combination of a cold winter 
with high prices, it could send bills up quite substantially. Certainly, 
there could be some reaction." Lay said he expected prices to be high for the 
short to medium term, coming down over next two to three years. "As long as 
regulators leave it alone, this market will come back into balance." Lay 
pointed out that even if prices to consumers hit $8.20/Mcf this winter, it 
would be just equal to the price level, adjusted for inflation, in 1986. 

Even at today's prices, "energy is the best buy there is," Robert Allison, 
Jr., chairman of Anadarko Petroleum, told the group, pointing out how 
consumer prices for other basics such as houses and cars, have increased over 
the past 15 years. The problem with energy prices is they have stayed low for 
so long. 

If the government wants to take action, it should open more public lands to 
drilling, Allison said, estimating there are 213 Tcf of reserves--- or a 
10-year supply --- that are off limits in the lower 48 states. Only portions 
of the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska are effectively open for drilling. "It's up 
to Congress to provide greater access," Allison said. 

Others, including Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles, said government should encourage 
the building of additional pipeline capacity, particularly a new pipeline 
from Alaska. 

Leading off the "Governors' Natural Gas Summit: Responding to the Growing 
Energy Crisis," Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research 
Associates, called the current situation a "shock," not a "crisis." A lack of 
reserves would be a crisis, but there are plenty of reserves. It's simply 
that demand has accelerated and bumped up against the "iron law of lead 
times." He said the industry would have to invest more than $500 billion over 
the next ten years, nearly double the level of the 1990s, to keep up with new 
markets. 

Yergin called for the U.S. to coordinate supply development policy with 
Mexico and Canada. "This is not just a U.S. issue. And there will not be just 
U.S. solutions --- there must be a continent-wide response." 

In the meantime, the industry should attempt to cushion the short-term shock 
through consumer education, conservation and low income assistance programs.

Following our meeting Friday, we propose to make the following assumptions 
for resubscription of capacity rolling-off in 2001 (Steve, please let us know 
if you would like to change any of these numbers):

     Assumption Current or Extension
Plan Capacity  Months  Rate  Rate &/or Volume

EOT to WOT 20,000 Feb-Dec $.15  (KN @ $.1310)
EOT to WOT 70,000 Nov-Dec $.15  (Agave @ $.14)
EOT to WOT 8,000 Apr-Dec $.15  (APS @ $.1520)

BL to TH 20,000 Dec  max  (Valero BL to TH @ max*)

EOT to EOT 10,000 Mar-Dec $.025  (Duke - Atoka @ $.02)
EOT to EOT 30,000 Apr-Dec $.035  (Continental 15,000 @ $.07)
EOT to EOT 25,000 Oct-Dec ??  (PNM @ $.11 - decide assumption by Wed)
EOT to EOT 400,000 Nov-Dec $.0075  (USGT @ $.0075)
EOT to EOT 40,000 Nov-Dec $.07  (Agave @ $.06)
EOT to EOT 20,000 Dec  $.02  (Valero TH to EOT @ max*)

IG to BL 18,000  Jan-Dec $.04  (Duke 18,000 @ $.03)
IG to BL 4,000  Feb-Dec $.04  (Vastar @ $.06)
IG to BL 15,000  Dec  $.04  (BRT @ $.05)

S. IG to BL 120,200 Jan-Dec $.02  (Red Cedar I/C:  Southern @ $.02, Red Cedar 
@ $.02)
S. IG to BL 32,800 Jan-Dec $.02  (La Maquina I/C)
S. IG to BL 26,000 Feb-Dec $.02  (Red Cedar I/C:  Vastar @ $.06)

We're assuming:
 Agave will extend their contract for 1 or 2 years.  Assumed extension rates.
 PNM will extend their contract, but probably at a higher volume and lower 
rate.
 Amoco will not reduce their MAXDTQ (6,500 IG to WOT, 3,500 BL to WOT).  Rates
  range from $.175 to $.205.

FERC Approves Questar Pipeline

     The FERC has given final approval for a Questar $155 million
pipeline project to transport natural gas to southern California from
the Four Corners area at the borders of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and
Colorado. The ruling came after the commission was satisfied the
Questar Southern Trails Pipeline project would not harm the
environment. The project will consist of 693 miles of crude oil
pipeline that was bought by Questar in 1998 from Arco. The pipeline
will be converted for natural gas and several new compressors will be
built. The pipeline would be divided into a East Zone and a West
Zone. The East Zone will begin in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico
and end at the California border and carry up to 88 MMcf per day. The
West Zone is within California and has a capacity of 120 MMcf per
day.

Well believe it or not, it's almost Fall again.  And, of course, that means 
time for back to school, football, cooler weather (that means under 100 
degrees in Houston) and our annual marketing affiliate compliance seminar.

While we hold these sessions on an annual basis to ensure our continued 
compliance with FERC's standards of conduct, the session will not simply be a 
repeat of last year's materials.  Each year we try to focus on new aspects of 
the rules.  This year our sessions will focus on:

? Maintaining our web site in compliance with the rules
? Handling e-mail requests and inquiries from marketing affiliates
? The implications of new electronic tools - EOL, eThink, etc.

In addition, we have prepared some fun video examples to illustrate day to 
day application of the rules.

The session will last only 1 hour from 8:30 - 9:30 AM in 5C2.  Last year you 
let me know that you expected refreshments - so I'm happy to report that 
donuts and coffee will be served.

All Houston-based marketing, finance and operations staff receiving this 
e-mail need to attend a session on Tuesday, October 10.  This session is 
designed to address specific issues which are concerns for these groups.

New Xcel Energy Combination Completed

Just 17 months after announcement of merger plans, Minneapolis-based Northern 
States Power 
and Denver-based New Century Energies have cleared the last hurdle to combine 
under the new 
name Xcel Energy Inc. The merger creates one of the 10 largest electricity 
and natural gas 
companies in the United States. 

The Securities and Exchange Commission issued its approval of the merger, 
wrapping up approvals 
from several federal agencies and states where the companies operate. Xcel 
Energy will serve more 
than 3 million electricity and 1.5 million natural gas customers in 12 
states, and 2 million electricity 
customers internationally. Company headquarters will be in Minneapolis. 
Gradually, the NSP and NCE 
names will be phased out as Xcel Energy provides enhanced products and 
services in 12 states, 
including parts of Minnesota, Colorado, Wisconsin, Texas, Michigan, Kansas, 
Oklahoma, Arizona, New 
Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. 

Stock will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Aug. 21, under the 
symbol XEL. Current 
New Century Energies shareholders will receive 1.55 shares of Xcel Energy 
stock for each share of 
NCE they hold. NSP shareholders will get one for one and will not be required 
to exchange their existing 
NSP stock. 

The merger proposal was announced March 25, 1999, and completed in less than 
a year and a half. 
"This has been an incredibly successful merger process," said Jim Howard, 
Xcel chairman. "It demonstrates 
what can be accomplished when regulators, environmentalists, community 
leaders and the merger partners 
all work in a common direction --- to create a better utility company for the 
future." 

"Our strength will come from a base of millions of customers spread over a 
large area, combined with our 
rapidly growing non-regulated businesses like NRG Energy, now the seventh 
largest independent power 
producer in the world, " said Wayne Brunetti, Xcel president.

Yesterday's meeting concluded that real time fuel project should use socket 
to communicate
wtih SCADA to be in sync with other real time application in the group. 
Steve Littel sent his VB codes to me and I am working on it.

I asked Joe Zhou about TW Deal Analysis on Window 2000.  He said there should 
be no problem.
Window 2000 should have IE 5.0 features.

El Paso Field Services - EPFS has agreed to go forward on a new interconnect 
with TW in Eddy County, NM.  The size of the new interconnect will be 40,000 
MMBtu/d.  EPFS has agreed to pay $165,000 towards the cost estimate of 
$280,000 as well as commit 12,500 MMBtu/d throughput for a period of 2 
years.  Facility Planning is opening a new work order and we have begun 
drafting the Interconnect Agreement and the OBA for the new point.  The point 
should be active in 60 - 90 days.

Arizona Public Service - has still not signed the Transport Request for the 
14,000 MMBtu/d April - October 2001 capacity.  The current spread is $0.375 - 
$0.40.  

Red Cedar - has finally decided on their transport volume under our new 5 
year agreement.  Contract documentation is being prepared.

Sempra - has again exercised their option under their Gallup contract for 
21,500 MMBtu/d Permian to California for 1 year starting 11/1/01. The 
contract rate is $0.30 plus fuel.

Texaco is moving up to 100,000 MMBtu/d from PG&E Topock to Mojave starting 
8/21 through 10/31/00.  TW collected an incremental $.025/MMBtu for this move 
or approximately $160,000.

El Paso Outage-
 Current reports are the Office of Pipeline Safety is demanding El Paso hydro 
test, X-ray and ultrasonic test all 330 miles of pipe that is currently out 
of service due to last weekend's explosion.  It appears the 1 Bcf/d capacity 
to California may be off-line for up to one month.  

Related Developments
  --SoCal released capacity on El Paso for October 2000 to Dynegy at a 
reservation charge of $1.00/MMBtu.
  --Volume on various TW interconnect points has picked up on the east end 
including the new NGPL Winkler point.
  --We are receiving incremental volume from El Paso at Window Rock and 
collecting a portion of the market premium. 

Transport Options - a working group meeting with customers has been scheduled 
for Thursday August 31.  The objective will be to get everyone comfortable 
and build a coalition of support behind our new Options Tariff filing.

Burlington Resources - We held a conference call with John Hinton, Marketing 
Director, regarding the current operation of the Val Verde plant.  Our data 
indicates,with the exception of a few T-5 temperature limit days, TW has been 
able to accept over 98% of the gas nominated by the plant.  In addition, for 
the last 2 years, the plant has been delivering gas with CO2 in excess of our 
specs.  We agreed our latest amendment draft could use some stronger language 
in terms of TW's obligations beyond a "best efforts" basis.   John indicated 
a willingness to work together as they were trying to schedule a delivery of 
215,000 MMBtu to us for Hub delivery.   We agreed to talk again next week 
once the volume test was complete.

I hope that you found the August 25 electric class informative and thought 
provoking.  I 'm sure that in some cases the material was too basic and in 
other cases the information was more than you wanted or needed.

Please send me some feedback on the class, including:

How were the speakers?  Did you enjoy Jim Crist and John Adamiak?  Would you 
prefer having an Enron speaker or an outside speaker at any future electric 
sessions?

Did the class cover the right topics?  Are there any additional areas for 
which you are looking for information?

Do the written materials suit your needs?

How about the setting?  Was the whiteboard instruction approach useful?

Other thoughts?

Duke Stands By California Market

In the midst of much uncertainty surrounding California's power situation, 
Duke Energy North America Monday reiterated its commitment to the state's 
struggling wholesale electricity market, announcing new bilateral power deals 
with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and progress with redevelopment plans at 
three coastal power plant sites it is operating. 

"Duke is committed to continue playing a major role to help California 
address its electricity shortfall and the high prices many felt this summer," 
said Bill Hall, Duke's vice president for the western region in North 
America, noting that brownfield projects in California have turned out to be 
more difficult than new plants to site, based on Duke's experience over the 
last three years. 

In response to questions, Hall acknowledged that Duke is constantly 
reassessing its position in California and a return by the state energy 
officials to a cost-based regulated market would cause him a lot of concern, 
but he is confident at this point that for the long-term market solutions 
will be applied. He said in his meetings with state political and regulatory 
leaders he is convinced they know the state can't turn back to a traditional 
command-and-control regulatory structure and they recognize that "multiple 
solutions" are needed, including balancing supply/demand for power. 

"We believe that new generation coming on line throughout the West in the 
next few years will lessen the market volatility and markets will begin to 
react based on supply/demand stability," Hall said. 

Both Hall's and Duke's western trading executive, Nancy DeSchane, said they 
are very anxious to see what the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
releases Wednesday with its initial draft decision on what it will do to 
address California wholesale electricity prices, including whether it intends 
to extend the California Independent System Operator's (Cal-ISO's) authority 
to impose price caps. 

Hall said Duke has signed a series of "substantial long-term wholesale 
electricity contracts" with PG&E's utility that will "help stabilize the 
price volatility for the distributor's retail customers." He would not 
disclose the terms of the deal, including the volumes and duration, but said 
the supplies are slated to be received in the state's northern zone (NP-15). 
Earlier Duke offered California utilities five-year deals at $50/MWh. Duke's 
Salt Lake City-based trading arm is doing the deal, rather than its 
California-based generation plants, meaning the power could come from sources 
inside or outside of the state. 

Hall said Duke has begun work with local city officials in the San Diego 
suburb of Chula Vista to accelerate the current schedule for replacing the 
South Bay Power Plant, which Duke leases with an option to buy. "We hope 
within the next year we'll be able to announce what we can do to expedite the 
replacement of this facility," he said. 

Following approvals from the state and a local water permit last week, Duke 
will begin its $500 million modernization of Moss Landing Power Plant along 
the north central coast "within the next 30 to 60 days," Hall said. The 
upgrade will add 1,060 MW to the site's current 1,500-MW capacity and will 
require a 30-40% increase in the plant's natural gas requirements, which 
PG&E's gas utility assures can be handled by the existing pipeline 
infrastructure. 

"We've had discussions with PG&E, and we're obviously concerned that we have 
sufficient infrastructure to transport gas that we purchase into the system," 
Hall said. "We're confident that their infrastructure can support Moss," 
although, he added, that statewide "we certainly have concerns about the gas 
infrastructure" and Duke is working with state officials to assure there are 
adequate gas supplies. 

"We had some problems this summer in Southern California, and San Diego Gas 
and Electric recently announced it is going to begin an intense look at what 
needs to be done to upgrade its (gas pipeline) infrastructure to support the 
new generation plants coming on board." 

Salt Lake City-based DeSchane said Duke has a "balanced" portfolio of supply 
and storage contracts, noting that she thinks her company has a "very strong 
physical position in the West for gas," and the trading unit will be working 
over the next couple of years "to assure that the gas position is sustained 
and continues to grow." 

Down the central coast about 80 miles at Morro Bay, Duke has resubmitted 
revised plans for totally replacing the 1950s-era power plant in a renovation 
that will build a new $600 million 1,200-MW plant. With prompt state 
approvals, Hall said Duke could bring the new plant online by the summer of 
2003 and demolish the existing (1,000-MW) plant by 2007, adding that PG&E 
cannot deliver additional gas supplies so the added output is a product of 
the anticipated improved efficiency of the new plant.

Enron's preferred provider contract for administrative and office temporary 
labor with Pro Staff expires at the end of the year.  

We are currently reviewing Enron's options in the area of sourcing 
administrative and office temporary labor to provide the best service to 
Enron's user community and capture the greatest value for Enron.  As part of 
the process, a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be provided to selected 
vendors in September with a target date for selection in early November.  

The potential outcomes of the RFP process may range from selection of a 
preferred provider through use of an integrator to provide centralized 
reporting, centralized billing, and overall reduced internal administrative 
burden and costs.

Team members representing a cross section of the users of this service will 
provide requirements, evaluate vendor responses and communicate with their 
functional and Business Unit constitituents throughout this process. 

We request your feedback on specific needs or vendors you think should be 
considered in this process to one of the Team members below or Diane Eckels, 
Project Leader by Monday, September 11th.  Your opinions are appreciated!

Kevin Hyatt, Director for the TW Commercial Team,  is a member of the Enron 
Kids Committee.  He has again volunteered to be the GPG coordinator for those 
of you interested in adopting or contributing to the Enron Kids Christmas 
campaign.

This year the Committee has adopted HISD's Burrus Elementary.

If you're not familiar with Enron Kids, this is the program where Enron 
adopts all the kids in a local school where a majority of the families are 
living near or below the poverty line.  The adoption consists of groups of 
employees selecting one or more children and buying a full set of clothes 
(including socks, underwear, shoes, and an overcoat) plus a toy and book.  
The approximate cost is $125 per child adopted.  All the gifts are 
distributed by the Committee during a party at the school several weeks 
before Christmas.  In a lot of cases, our gifts are the only things the kids 
will get this year.

If you're interested in participating--  Here's what you do:

Reply via email to Kevin Hyatt with your anticipated $ donation.  Kevin will 
be in charge of collecting funds and coordinating the buying of presents.  If 
you (or your spouse or significant other) want to volunteer to assist with 
the shopping, please let him know.  Kevin will provide a daily update of the 
donations total.  Please let Kevin know your donation by Tuesday November 
14.  We will adopt the maximum number of kids on Wednesday November 15.

Thanks for your assistance.

Houston-area ET&S employees:  (The Marketing group should have already been 
contacted by Jean McFarland.)




Next week, we are going to begin Phase I of the Windows 2000/Outlook 
Project.  In this phase, we will be gathering information about the hardware 
and software that you are using within your group.  

The process will begin with an email inventory.  You will receive an email on 
Monday, September 25, with the subject of W2K Inventory-Please Open.  All you 
need to do is open the email message.  This email will do a quick inventory 
of applications you have installed on your PC or that you may access from the 
network, as well as your desktop hardware specifications.  The information 
gathered from this email will be stored in a Notes database for reporting.  
It is very important that you open this email from your primary workstation.  
Please do not open it remotely, or if you're checking someone else's mail.

Mid-week, we will deploy teams to conduct individual interviews to assure 
that we have a complete picture of your technical environment.  This process 
will take approximately six weeks to complete for all of ETS.  The findings 
from these interviews will determine the Phase II start date.

Data Responsibility

As we prepare for this massive effort, we ask that you assist us by doing the 
following:
1) identify any business-related applications that may reside locally.
2) remove data from the local drive of your desktop (c:\ and/or d:\), and 
store it on your network drive.  The special data requirements of laptop  
users will be addressed during the actual migration.
3) remove all non-business-related data from network drives.
4) remove non-company-owned applications from your environment.
5) if you have historical data that does not change, contact the Solution 
Center and have a CD created for a more permanent storage method.


Training for Windows 2000/Outlook

Training requirements will be addressed during Phase II by a number of 
methods that will include:
hands-on training, which will consist of 1 hour on Windows 2000 and 2 hours 
on Outlook,
IPTV video,
tri-fold cards on the Microsoft products, and
CBT (Computer-Based Training).  

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to contact 
the:

ETS Solution Center at 54745

Team-- in my absence please submit additional bullets this week to Audrey by 
10:00 am Fri.  thanks

Main Line West Outage - West flow capacity has been reduced by approximately 
200,000 MMBtu/d for five days beginning 9/6 for pipeline testing.  To 
accommodate the market and customer needs, we have negotiated transport for 
50,000 MMBtu/day from PG&E to Needles for Max Rate of $.25 for the five day 
outage.  We also did a Market Center lend for 40,000 MMBtu/day @ $0.10.  
Estimated incremental revenue for the 5 day outage at this time is $82,500.  

KN/Oneok Contract -  We negotiated a 12 month max rate agreement with Oneok 
for 20,000 MMBtu/d of west flow capacity starting February 1, 2001.  We also 
negotiated in the contract a provision whereby if Oneok releases any of the 
capacity above the max rate, then TW shares 50/50 in the incremental 
revenue.  All executed documents have been received.

FERC / California Power Prices - The FERC plans to convene a public meeting 
the week of September 11 in California to take comments from interested 
parties regarding the recent price spikes of wholesale electricity and power 
transmission in the state.  In addition, SoCal Edison filed a motion late 
last week with the California Public Utility Commission seeking emergency 
relief from high spot gas prices on which its power purchase rates are based. 
The company told the CPUC that Southern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices 
in the last month have risen by $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market 
manipulation, in particular the withholding off of the market of pipeline 
transportation capacity between the supply basins and the California border. 

"There is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential has 
been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse, collusion 
and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers and merchants," 
Edison told the CPUC. 

The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC 
regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of "certain allegedly 
collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gas 
suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas 
prices by wrongfully withholding capacity." It notes the complaint 
"conservatively estimates that the anti-competitive manipulation of the basis 
differential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by $100 
million annually since the beginning of 1998." 

Jeff Dasovich from the Enron California office will attend the FERC meeting.

Effective immediately, Joe Jeffers, Manager of Technical Training and Skill 
Based Pay Administration, and his team of Dick Heitman, Cliff McPherson, 
Andrea Woody and Lupi Trevino will move from ETS Human Resources to ETS 
Operations Technical Services.  Joe will report to Steve Klimesh.  

This move will better align Technical Training and SBP Administration with 
Operations and enhance the interfaces that take place between this group and 
ETS Operations management and the field teams. 

Joe and his team have provided outstanding support to Operations in the past, 
and it is expected that this high standard of customer service will 
continue.  We will be sending more information in the very near future with 
regard to the individual support accountabilities of the team members.  

Please join me in welcoming this team and helping to make their transition a 
smooth one.

InterGen Takes 30% Stake in Coral Energy

With plans to grow its power generation portfolio in the United States, 
InterGen, the power generation 
joint venture of Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Bechtel Enterprise Holdings 
Inc., closed a deal yesterday 
giving the international developer a 30% equity interest in Houston-based 
Coral Energy, one of the 
largest natural gas and power marketers in the country. 

Coral Energy officials had predicted in July that Shell and construction 
giant Bechtel would fold InterGen, 
InterGen North America and certain assets of Coral Energy into one business 
(see Daily GPI, July 10). 
Under the agreement announced yesterday, InterGen will receive the majority 
of the natural gas pipeline, 
storage and power generation assets of Shell's Coral Energy affiliate in the 
United States. It remains a 
joint venture of Shell and Bechtel. 

The move gives Shell a 68% ownership in InterGen, with Bechtel owning the 
remaining 32%. InterGen 
had been formed as a 50/50 joint venture, and Bechtel made an undisclosed 
payment to Shell in the 
deal. About 230 Coral employees, mostly related to the Texas-based assets in 
Houston, will become 
InterGen employees under the agreement. 

InterGen is considered a world leader in power generation development, with 
projects around the world. 
Carlos Riva, InterGen's CEO, said that the transaction "represents a 
significant boost to our plans in the 
United States. These assets and strengthened alignment with a premier U.S. 
gas and electricity trading 
enterprise will provide InterGen a strong platform for growth in the U.S. 
market." 

Globally, the alignment is expected to help leverage Shell's strengths in 
both fuel supply and power 
marketing and trading. Bechtel will continue to be InterGen's preferred 
provider for worldwide power 
generation engineering, procurement and construction services. Coral is the 
region's third largest natural 
gas marketer and the twentieth largest power marketer in the country. 

Linda Cook, Shell Gas and Power's CEO, said the "whole idea" was to help 
InterGen grow in the United 
States, and that the best way was to add Shell assets to it. "Success in 
tomorrow's energy markets will 
be earned through globally aligned marketing, trading and asset companies," 
said Cook. "That's 
critically true in the U.S. and will be the case as competitive energy 
markets open worldwide. InterGen 
plans to build a sizable power generation portfolio in the U.S., working 
closely with Coral to pursue 
investment decisions that make the most commercial sense. We expect this 
relationship to make a 
significant contribution to both InterGen's and Coral's long-term success." 

Shell and Bechtel formed InterGen in March 1999 (see Daily GPI, March 18, 
1999) specifically to pursue 
power generation opportunities in North America. The Boston-based company was 
set up to develop, 

"Shell, Bechtel and InterGen have among them the complete skill set for 
success in the new global energy 
market," said Paul Unruh, COO of Bechtel. "InterGen is a world-class 
developer with a proven track record 
of successfully developing, financing and operating projects around the 
world. Shell is one of the most 
successful marketers and traders of energy in the U.S. and is expanding into 
deregulating natural gas 
and power markets globally; Bechtel is a global leader in the development, 
engineering and construction 
of power facilities. These strengths together create a large power generation 
platform now directly linked 
with global energy marketing and trading." 

InterGen's portfolio will give Coral Energy access for its trading business, 
and Coral will participate as part 
of Shell's global trading network, with InterGen a business partner in its 
expanding North American asset 
platform. As the exclusive marketer of Shell's gas production, Coral has a 
gas supply of 2.5 Bcf/d, and a 
trading platform dealing in extensive volumes of energy in all key supply 
basins. For Bechtel, the agreement 
will help it lock in construction contracts for its combined cycle gas 
turbine power stations. 

Specifically, the assets to be transferred to InterGen from Coral include the 
following: 

4,000 miles of major intrastate gas pipelines in Texas. The pipeline 
facilities extend from South Texas near the 
Mexican border along the Texas Gulf Coast to the Louisiana boarder, and north 
from near Houston to the East 
Texas producing areas. 
The West Clear Lake Storage facility, one of the largest natural gas storage 
reservoirs in Texas. Located near 
the Houston Ship Channel, it has a leasehold interest in the Stratton Ridge 
storage facility. 
Coral's interest of more than 500 MW in four power plants --- one in 
operation and three under construction. The 
transfer would follow equity and regulatory approvals. 
In total, Coral had 6,100 miles of gas pipeline that ran along the Gulf Coast 
in Texas and Louisiana. It also is 
building a 100-mile long pipeline in northern Mexico with that country's 
national oil company, PEMEX. 

Currently, InterGen is either operating or building 11 power stations with a 
total of 7,985 MW. It also has
7,040 MW in advanced development. Projects are being operated, under 
construction or are in advanced 
development in the United Kingdom, the Philippines, Colombia, Mexico, China, 
Egypt, Brazil, Australia, Turkey 
and the United States.

At approximately 8:15 a.m. on Monday morning, September 25th, the GTA server 
went down due to a corrupted System volume.  The GTA server has an identical 
failover server that is being mirrored throughout the day.  Unfortunately, 
this data corruption also occurred on the failover's System volume.  In the 
recovery process, we were unable to bring up the failover due to the 
corruption on both servers.

Vendor support was required in order to recover GTA and the corrupted 
volume.  Although we talked to the vendor about possible causes for the 
corruption, our primary focus was on the server recovery.  The server was 
operational at approximately 11:10 am.  The Server Platform Team is working 
with the vendors to determine the root cause. 

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

If you have any questions, please call Bob Martinez at 713-853-7574.

Thanks,

ETS Solution Center

participate in Vince Kaminski's eSpeak event.  Vince is the Managing Director 
of Enron Research and will be discussing the importance of Enron Research and

We know you all have ideas or questions about Enron, and chances are they 
won't be addressed if you keep them to yourselves.  Why not put them in eMeet 
and see what sort of feedback you get?

This worked out better the last time.  Either you did not bother to launch 
and read this or you liked the pdf file better.  Either way, I received a lot 
less negative feedback!  So, I'm doing it again.  I am sending you the pdf 
file.  Double click on the attached and launch in Acrobat reader.  

If you have problems or, if you really would like a different way, let me 
know.  Just respond to this note or call me at 713-853-3986.  If you prefer a 
printed copy or a non-graphic version, let me know that too.

Transwestern is seeking your assistance in conducting a workshop on its 
proposed Transport Options Program.  We are asking a small group of our 
business partners representing a cross section of Transwestern's customer 
base to help us resolve some of the remaining details of the program.  During 
the 2-hour workshop, Transwestern will attempt to answer questions raised by 
its customers following the original rollout of the program a couple of weeks 
ago.  It is hoped that following the workshop, we can put the finishing 
touches to a service offering that merits the support of those involved in 
the workshop group as well as the FERC and Transwestern's shippers.  We ask 
that you send both a commercial representative as well as a regulatory or 
legal representative in order that we can address the full range of issues 
affecting this proposed filing.  Below are the details of the meeting:

News Briefs:
+Calpine to Acquire SkyGen Energy

Calpine Corp. said it plans to acquire SkyGen Energy LLC (SkyGen Energy)
from Michael Polsky and from Wisvest Corp., a Wisconsin Energy Corp.
affiliate, for $450 million, plus the assumption of certain obligations of
SkyGen Energy. The SkyGen Energy acquisition -- along with other recently
announced acquisitions -- would increase Calpine's 2004 operating portfolio
to over 40,000 MW of generation.

Upon closing of the transaction, expected during the third quarter of 2000,
Calpine will increase its power portfolio by up to 13,500 MW of natural
gas-fired generation in the U.S., and will acquire 34 General Electric 7 FA
gas turbines. Under terms of the agreement, Calpine will add three operating
facilities (780 MW), three projects under construction (812 MW), 13
late-stage development facilities (5,258 MW) and 16 project development
opportunities (6,615 MW).

SkyGen was founded by Michael Polsky in 1991. SkyGen will continue to
develop its portfolio of development projects as a wholly owned subsidiary
of Calpine. Michael Polsky will serve as President of SkyGen and as a member
of Calpine's Board of Directors. To fund the SkyGen Energy and other
recently announced acquisitions, Calpine has obtained a $1 billion
short-term credit facility with The Bank of Nova Scotia, Credit Suisse First
Boston and CIBC World Markets. The company expects to refinance this
facility in the capital markets.

**********
+Panda, Calpine Form Business Alliance

Panda Energy International and Calpine Corp. formed a  business alliance
involving eight power plant projects Panda has under development,
representing nearly 10,000 MW of generating capacity. Under terms of the
agreement, Panda will provide development capabilities and carry each of the
projects to the construction phase. Calpine will have exclusive rights to
construct, own and operate the plants. Panda will participate in 50% of the
cash flow, above Calpine's priority return, in all the projects within the
alliance.

Included in the pact is the acquisition by Calpine of 24 General Electric
7FA combustion gas turbines and 12 steam turbines scheduled for delivery in
2001 to 2002. The first project to be developed under the alliance will be
the Oneta Power Partners, L.P., a 1,000 MW  natural gas-fueled power plant
now being built in Coweta, OK. Under terms of the agreement, Calpine will
pay Panda approximately $126 million, which includes reimbursement of
development costs, payments for the gas and steam turbines and the Oneta
facility. The Oneta transaction is expected to close in July. It is
scheduled to go into service in 2002.

More info on Allegheny.  Apparently, they're taking funds derived from the=
=20
forced
divestiture of their utility based generating assets and using them to=20
purchase
new IPP plants.  Allegheny (as reported recently) is looking at building a=
=20
plant in the
Palo Verde area. =20


Allegheny buys Enron plants
Allegheny Energy Supply, the unregulated
generation unit of Maryland-based Allegheny
Energy, showed further proof this week of its
aspirations to become a nationwide wholesale
power provider, buying gas-fired plants from
Enron that serve three regions.
Financial terms of the acquisition were not
disclosed, but Allegheny will take possession of
three peaking units developed by Enron North
America: the 546-MW Gleason plant in Gleason,
Tenn.; the 508-MW Wheatland plant in
Wheatland, Ind.; and the 656-MW Lincoln Energy
Center in Manhattan, Ill.
Allegheny has been building and buying
facilities in Pennsylvania but last month gave the
first signal of its broader aspirations, announcing
plans to build a 1,080-MW unit in Arizona.
The three plants being acquired from Enron
all were developed after the 1998 price spikes
in Midwest markets, which highlighted the lack
of flexible generation in the area. All three entered
commercial operation in June 2000.
Don Feenstra, vice president of new
projects at Allegheny Energy Supply, said the
acquisitions fit with the company=01,s broader goal
of doubling the original size of its generation fleet
(about 8,200 MW) in five years. The three Enron
plants total 1,710 MW, swelling Allegheny=01,s portfolio
to more than 12,000 MW. Once the first goal
is reached, Allegheny wants to increase its generation
holdings by another 50% in a second five-year
period.  Feenstra said the Enron plants all can be
converted to combined-cycle for use over ex-tended
periods.

Yes, it's the largest time of the year!  :)
===========================================

>I hate this time of year. Not for its crass commercialism and forced
frivolity, but because it's the season when the food police come out
with their wagging fingers and annual tips on how to get through the
holidays without gaining 10 pounds.
>
>You can't pick up a magazine without finding a list of holiday eating
do's and don'ts. Eliminate second helpings, high-calorie sauces and cookies
made with butter, they say. Fill up on vegetable sticks, they say.
>
>Good grief. Is your favorite childhood memory of Christmas a carrot
stick?  I didn't think so. Isn't mine, either. A carrot was something you
left for Rudolph.
>
>I have my own list of tips for holiday eating. I assure you, if you
follow them, you'll be fat and happy.
>
>So what if you don't make it to New Year's? Your pants won't fit
anymore,anyway.
>
>1. About those carrot sticks. Avoid them. Anyone who puts carrots on a
holiday buffet table knows nothing of the Christmas spirit. In fact, if
you see carrots, leave immediately. Go next door, where they're serving rum
balls.
>
>2. Drink as much eggnog as you can. And quickly. Like fine single-malt
scotch, it's rare. In fact, it's even rarer than single-malt scotch. You
can't find it any other time of year but now. So drink up! Who cares
that it has 10,000 calories in every sip? It's not as if you're going to
turn into an eggnogaholic or something. It's a treat. Enjoy it. Have one for
me.  Have two. It's later than you think. It's Christmas!
>
>3. If something comes with gravy, use it. That's the whole point of
gravy.  Gravy does not stand alone. Pour it on. Make a volcano out of your
mashed potatoes. Fill it with gravy. Eat the volcano. Repeat.
>
>4. As for mashed potatoes, always ask if they're made with skim milk or
whole milk. If it's skim, pass. Why bother? It's like buying a sports
car with an automatic transmission.
>
>5. Do not have a snack before going to a party in an effort to control
your eating. The whole point of going to a Christmas party is to eat
other people's food for free. Lots of it. Hello? Remember college?
>
>6. Under no circumstances should you exercise between now and New
Year's.  You can do that in January when you have nothing else to do. This
is the time for long naps, which you'll need after circling the buffet table
while carrying a 10-pound plate of food and that vat of eggnog.
>
>7. If you come across something really good at a buffet table, like
frosted Christmas cookies in the shape and size of Santa, position
yourself near them and don't budge. Have as many as you can before becoming
the center of attention. They're like a beautiful pair of shoes. You can't
leave them behind. You're not going to see them again.
>
>8. Same for pies. Apple. Pumpkin. Mincemeat. Have a slice of each. Or,
if you don't like mincemeat, have two apples and one pumpkin. Always have
three. When else do you get to have more than one dessert? Labor Day?
>
>9. Did someone mention fruitcake? Granted, it's loaded with the
mandatory celebratory calories, but avoid it at all cost. I mean, have some
standards, mate.
>
>10. And one final tip: If you don't feel terrible when you leave the
party or get up from the table, you haven't been paying attention. Reread
tips.  Start over.
>
>But hurry! Cookieless January is just around the corner.

Devon Energy and Santa Fe Snyder completed their $2.5 billion merger 
yesterday as shareholders of both companies approved the deal, which was 
announced in May. The agreement called for each Santa Fe Snyder common share 
to be converted into 0.22 shares of Devon common stock. Conversion requires 
issuance of 40.6 million additional Devon common shares, resulting in total 
shares outstanding of 127.7 million. Former Santa Fe Snyder shareholders now 
own 32% of the combined company. Historical Devon shareholders own 68% of the 
combined company. The transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of 
interests. With merger completion, Devon now ranks among the top five 
U.S.-based independent oil and gas producers in terms of market 
capitalization, total proved reserves and annual production. The company has 
an enterprise value of $9 billion and proved reserves of 1.1 billion boe. The 
company expects to realize $30 million to $35 million in annual cost savings 
from the merger. Devon was added to the S&P 500 Index after the close of 
business yesterday.

Overdraft protection.  What does that really mean?  If you're talking about a 
checking account, it means you won't pay a penalty for insufficient funds.  
What about intellectual overdraft protection?  The penalty is much greater if 
you have insufficient funds in your mental bank account.

Making frequent visits to Resources in the ThinkBank is solid protection 
against intellectual overdraft.  In Resources, the ThinkBank tellers have put 
together a list of books and software -- sort of a knowledge "nest egg" for 
you to build on.

Resources.  We've got your intellectual capital covered.

Great Expectations
Forbes - 10/16/2000
BY Lynn Cook
Copyright 2000 Forbes Inc.

ENRON INVESTMENT PARTNERS' BIGGEST GAMBLE TO DATE HAS BEEN THE $4 MILLION IT 
pumped into Cynet. The software outfit relies on a wireless modem that plugs 
in to a laptop or PC and lets you e-mail, fax, and use voice-and 
data-messaging. That may not sound like much. But imagine e-mailing thousands 
of people at once--or sending a document and following with a prerecorded 
message to tell folks to check their fax machines. Cynet is also developing 
the ability to retrieve e-mail messages as voice mail on a laptop and to 
translate voice mail into e-mail.

The investment helped launch Cynet as the first African-American company to 
go public out of Houston. How's it doing? Not so hot. After the initial 
offering in January the stock jumped to $8, but it got pummeled in April and 
now hovers around $1. It has yet to recover. 

Still, Enron is holding on to its investment, now worth only $1.9 million. 
Cynet holds the exclusive North American marketing license for Teleran 
Electronic's wireless modems. That's got to be worth something. Compaq 
Computer is using the technology to add high-speed wireless Internet 
connections to its iPAQ Pocket.

Note:  Williams does not give the amount of volume response they received in 
their open season.  540,000 Dth/d was their
established volume at the onset.  Also, it is interesting that they are 
naming the Oklahoma intrastate markets as their market
for the project.

Western Frontier Pipe Gets Rave Reviews

After successfully completing a non-binding open season on Sept. 21, for the 
Western Frontier project, Williams' gas pipeline unit plans to hold a binding 
open season in the near future to gauge the exact market interest in the 
project that would transport gas supply from the Rockies to the mid-continent 
region. 

"We are very pleased with the interest the market has shown in our Western 
Frontier Project. We continue to believe that Western Frontier will be a 
cost-effective way to bring economically-priced Rockies supply into the 
mid-continent," said Kim Cocklin, vice president of customer services and 
rates for Williams' Central and Texas Gas pipeline systems. 

The Western Frontier Project is expected to transport up to 540,000 dth/d 
from the Cheyenne Hub to Williams' Hugoton Compressor Station on the Central 
system in southwest Kansas and its Oklahoma-Hugoton pipeline. 

The project would also have access to ANR Pipeline, Panhandle Eastern 
Pipeline, Northern Natural Gas and Natural Gas Pipeline of America. Williams 
believes this project would be able to supply a "seamless transport at an 
incremental cost" to Oklahoma intrastate markets by way of the Central 
system. Through the Central system, customers would also be able to access 
storage including directly owned and third party storage fields. 

Williams expects Western Frontier's rates to Hugoton to fall in the mid-20 
cents per dth. The company also expects a fuel rate of less than 1%. Expected 
to be in service during November 2003, the project will require the 
construction of almost 400 miles of pipeline and the addition of 13,000 HP.

Note:  EIA has increased their gas demand and price figures.  At the bottom 
of this synopsis, the web site address  will 
direct you to the full report released today if you would like further 
information.

EIA: Gas Takes Bigger Share Long-Term

A higher rate of economic growth will lead to a greater expansion in natural 
gas use than previously forecast over the next 20 years --- to 34.7 Tcf/ year 
in 2020, up from 31.5 Tcf --- and a 10% increase in projected prices --- from 
$2.81/Mcf to $3.13, according to the Energy Information Administration's 
latest report. 

EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 2001 (AEO2001) released today projects U.S. 
economic growth at an average rate of 3% a year over the next 20 years, up 
from its previous estimate of 2.1% per year. The economic growth will boost 
overall U.S. energy demand from 96 quadrillion Btu in 1999 to 127 quads in 
2020, up from the 121 energy quads projected by EIA one year ago (see Daily 
GPI, Nov. 10, 1999). The increase in the projection for natural gas demand by 
2020 of slightly over 3 Tcf (loosely equal to 3 quads) is responsible for 
about half the change in energy projections. 

EIA says the 62% increase in gas demand from 21.4 Tcf in 1999 to 34.7 Tcf in 
2020, will be spurred by a tripling of gas use for power generation. During 
the next 20 years 89% of new power generation units will be fueled by natural 
gas. Gas prices are expected to decline within two years from current highs. 
"In the longer term, technology improvements in the exploration and 
production of oil and natural gas are expected to moderate price increases 
even as demand for these fuels grows." 

EIA projects world oil prices will reach $22.41/barrel (in 1999 dollars) in 
2020, up just slightly from the $22.04 in last year's forecast. 

The federal bean counters see a 1.8% average annual increase in power demand 
over the next 20 years, compared to the 1.3% they predicted last year. Prices 
will decline from the current 6.7 cents per kWh, but not as much as predicted 
last year due to the higher projected gas prices. Instead of 5.8 cents per 
kWh in 2020, EIA's AEO2001 sees electric rates holding at 6.0 cents per kWh. 

Power to be provided by nuclear generation jumped 34% from the forecast last 
year "due to lower estimated costs for extending the life of current nuclear 
plants and higher projected natural gas prices, although total nuclear 
generation still declines as some existing plants retire." 

Coal will still be the primary fuel for power generation, but its share will 
dwindle from 51% to 44% of the generating total.

Sunday, November 5th, is the big day.  Although we have less than two weeks 
left, we still have several exciting fundraising activities taking place.  
All walkers should continue getting pledges and watch for further 
instructions on turning in the walk forms.  Everyone has done an incredible 
job this year.  Great news, we are getting very close to reaching our goal, 
but if we want to continue to be the number one walk team in Houston, we need 
to continue with our fundraising efforts.  Please plan to join us for the 
following activities this week:
 
Silent/Cyber Auction - The JDF Silent Cyber Auction will open for bids on 
Wednesday, October 25th, at 8:00 a.m. and will close on Thursday, October 
26th, at 4:00 p.m.  You may access the Cyber Auction to place your bids at 
8:00 a.m. on Wednesday, October 25th, by launching the website at 
http://ecinside.enron.net/apps/jdf.nsf  or go to the Enron home page on the 
Intranet and click on the JDF Cyber Auction.  For more information, contact 
Sophie Patel at ext. 35055 or Eddie Sera at ext. 30480.  

Bake Sale and Raffles - Just in time for the Holidays!  On Friday, October 
27th, we will have several groups selling delicious baked goods on the second 
floor level of the Enron Building outside the Energizer.  In addition, we 
will have representatives from some of our walk teams available for the 
purchase of raffle tickets at the same location.

For all that are not signed up, please join us in the walk.  You still have 
time.  It will take 2 minutes to fill out a walk form, you get a great 
Enron/JDF T-shirt for collecting or donating $25 or more, and will join 
hundreds of Enron employees and approximately 10,000 Houstonians for the walk 
on Sunday, November 5th, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I promise this will 
be a blast.  The Enron tent will be great again this year!  We will begin 
with a continental breakfast prior to the walk and when everyone returns from 
the walk we will have music, balloons for the children and wonderful Frankie 
Mandola's hamburgers, hot dogs and fries.  Parking at the Sam Houston Race 
Park is free.  You will be part of something very worthwhile and it will make 
you feel great.  This is a world class event.

Please contact any of the following Steering Committee members to make a 
donation, sign up as a walker, or ask any questions you may have.  Come join 
the fun.

Home Heating Costs to Soar this Winter

     Americans can expect home heating prices to jump as much as 44%
this winter because of strong economic growth and high crude oil
prices, according to the EIA. A winter with especially long periods
of cold weather' could cause even higher prices because heating fuel
storage levels are below average. Homes that use natural gas can
expect to see the biggest jump in bills. Prices paid by residential
customers are expected to average $8.58 per MMBtu, up about 30% from
last winter's average of $6.61. The higher prices, combined with
increased consumption, will push overall costs up to an average $780
this winter from $540 last year earlier, the EIA said in an annual 
report on winter fuels. High prices for competing petroleum-based
fuels will help keep natural gas prices high. Homes with heating oil
will pay about $949 for fuel this winter, up 25% from the $760  paid
last winter. Prices will average about $1.37 per gallon, up 16% from
last year's $1.18, the report said. The 4.5% of Americans who use
propane to heat their homes will pay about 27% more this winter at
$1,045, compared with $823 last year. Inventories of propane at the
end of last month were about 62 million barrels, 3 million above last
year's level. Distillate stockpiles, which include heating oil and
diesel fuel, will be about 114 million to 118 million barrels at the
start of the heating season, about 15% to 18% lower than last year,
the report said. The government projection excludes the heating oil
reserve created by the Clinton administration, which stores 2 million
barrels. Distillate stocks in the East Coast are 41 million barrels,
close to 40% less than last year's level. In New England stocks are
over 60% below the 1999 level. The EIA estimated the monthly price of
crude oil will remain above $28 per barrel for the rest of the year,
and then gradually decline next year to an average $25 per barrel.
Because of rising demand in Asia and continued growth in the US,
higher oil production by OPEC has not been able to stem the rally in
prices, the report said. US crude oil inventories are about 287
million barrels, 17 million barrels below last year. The deficit is
smaller than last month, when there was a 26 million-barrel
shortfall, though supplies are still 8% below normal and are not
expected to move into the normal range before the end of winter, the
report said.  Global oil demand this year is expected to increase 1.1
million barrels per day from last year and will grow by an additional
2 million barrels a day in 2001 to 78 million barrels a day,
according to the report. The average retail price for gasoline, which
was about $1.52 per gallon last week, will fall to about $1.46 per
gallon in December and $1.40 by next March, the report said. The
report says a very cold winter could cause Northeast heating oil
prices to surge, and that could spill over into East Coast diesel
markets. The government said the chances of this were greater this
year because of tight distillate supplies, especially in the
Northeast. Diesel prices will fall by about $0.09 to $1.55 per gallon
in December and $1.35 by next summer, assuming normal conditions this
winter.

Northern Natural Gas declared a force majeure after discovering a leak in its 
20-inch Plymouth to Mitchell line in the Permian Basin area of West Texas. 
Teams isolated the leak, NNG said Wednesday, and the approximate downtime was 
expected to be two days. Flow was scheduled to zero at the Shell Tippett, 
Burlington, Marathon Yates and Southern Union receipt points. 

El Paso reported raising maximum flow through Pecos River Station, near the 
site of a pipeline explosion Aug. 19, from 700 MMcf/d to 750 MMcf/d effective 
on Wednesday's business day. El Paso will continue to evaluate the available 
throughput level while operating under the federal Department of 
Transportation's Corrective Action Order on allowable pressures in the Pecos 
River area.

Michelle, here is what I faxed to Cathy.  Drew and Regulatory have approved 
it.  I did not hear back from Cathy.  If she wants any further changes, you

It's been years in the making and includes an all star cast of several but 
it's finally here.  

We have a new way of doing Park & Ride Business on TW.

Over the past month or so, I have been working with Morgan, Mike Bodnar, and 
Susan Scott to streamline the PNR Process and what follows is the result of 
this process.  

Effective immediately, we will no longer use packets for TW Park & Ride.  All 
prospective PNR Contracts for TW will be be set up in CBS similar to PNR 
Master Agreements except that they will include a PNR point and the PNR 
Template.   Term will be for 1 (one) year plus evergreen.  This should allow 
reduced paperwork for the shipper as well as the Contract/PLE Team and should 
enhance TW's service to their customers.

The new procedure is in the Instruction Book on Michelle's desk.

Attached is a copy of the procedure as well as a copy of the PNR contract.  

Let me know if you need clarification of have any questions.

Dennis

New Mexico Train De-railment - Most of this week was spent helping customers 
re-route gas as the train derailment on TW's right-of-way in McKinley County, 
New Mexico forced Operations to blow down the mainline in the east of Thoreau 
area.  The accident reduced flow to the California border by 250,000 MMBtu/d 
or 25%.  Once the 27 rail cars were removed, a determination was made that 
line would need to be hydro-tested to ensure no damage had occurred.  
Approximately 2000 feet of pipe was excavated, the coating inspected and/or 
replaced, and if test results are good, the line should be back in service 
sometime during the weekend of November 3.  While the pipe is being recoated, 
the line segment will only operate at 80% of maximum pressure.  TW costs and 
revenue losses are being tracked to enable us to recoup damages from 
Burlington and/or Enron business interruption insurance.

Sempra Trading - The loss of gas supply from TW's east end enabled us to sell 
a max rate IT agreement for 100,000 MMBtu/d to Sempra during this outage.  
Duke also moved 40,000 MMBtu/d of alternate volume west at max rates.

Transport Options Tariff - The deadline to file protests on TW's Transport 
Options Program was Monday October 30.  Twenty-two parties filed 
interventions, of which only three were protests: PG&E, SoCal/Sempra, and 
Dynegy.  We expect FERC to schedule a technical conference sometime in the 
next 30 days.

Non-binding Open Season - The solicitation was published and sent to 
customers this week asking for expressions of interest in capacity turnback 
or pipeline expansions across all of TW.  Responses are due November 17th.

The GD article today regarding the proposed decision is a pretty good Reade=
rs=20
Digest version of the order.  Susan and I spoke with Jeff Dasovich and Mark=
=20
Baldwin yesterday, and the consensus of those conversations was that=20
Transwestern should remain involved in this proceeding only for purposes of=
=20
implementation/documentation.  Jeff offered that he might send a letter to=
=20
Governor Gray's office expressing both dismay and indignation that the CPUC=
=20
didn't complete their task and warning of the adverse outcome to California=
=20
ratepayers if these more modest reforms are approved.  He may ask the other=
=20
Comprehensive Settlement parties to join in signing the letter.  Susan, Mar=
k=20
and I spoke about this idea later, and we've got some reservations about TW=

role in admonishing the CPUC.   We should probably wait to see this letter=

first before committing to anything.

Bilas draft cautious toward SoCal competition
Mindful of the current chaos over energy markets in the state, California=
=20
Public Utilities
Commissioner Richard Bilas has recommended the adoption of a much more=20
moderate
approach to promoting competition on Southern California Gas=01, (SoCal) sy=
stem.
In his draft decision, Bilas advised the commission to reject the unbundlin=
g=20
of intrastate
transmission and instead approve the first settlement filed in the case, th=
e=20
less far-reaching
Interim Settlement (IS), submitted in December 1999. SoCal, San Diego Gas a=
nd=20
Electric and
other parties filed two more settlements after the IS, reaching a=20
comprehensive agreement in
April this year.

But since then, gas and power prices skyrocketed in the state, prompting a=
=20
consumer
backlash and giving competition a bad name.  The draft language notes that=
=20
the first interim
settlement was supported by more customer groups than the later agreements.
Recent events =01&lead us to conclude that the centerpiece of this=20
investigation, the unbundling
of intrastate transmission and the implementation of a system of firm,=20
tradable intrastate transmission rights, should be delayed,=018 according t=
o the=20
draft order.  =01&This unbundling is the basis of the [comprehensive settle=
ment]=20
and we cannot approve it. We do not, however, wish to commit to paralysis=
=20
until 2006, as the [post-interim settlement] would have us do. Accordingly,=
=20
we believe Californians are better served at this juncture by the adoption,=
=20
with modifications, of the IS.=018

The biggest change to the IS in the draft is the rejection of an automatic=
=20
capacity expansion
by SoCal at Wheeler Ridge, Calif., with rolled-in rates if certain criteria=
=20
are met.  El Paso
Energy had objected to the provision in the IS that would have allowed SoCa=
l=20
to automatically
expand capacity at Wheeler Ridge by 100 million cfd if a certain number of=
=20
curtailments oc-curred. =20
El Paso objected to forcing all shippers to pay for the expansion at Wheele=
r=20
when only certain customers would benefit. =20
The draft says SoCal can file a separate application for the Wheeler Ridge=
=20
expansion, but approval would be conditioned on a traditional hearing proce=
ss.

The draft decision would also:
=01=07 End SoCal=01,s current =01&windowing=018 process, which limits shipp=

for deliveries between receipt points on the system. It is replaced with an=

that required

=01=07 Provide for rate recovery of up to $3.5 million in implementation co=

In addition, the draft would unbundle core interstate transportation from=

rates, eliminate
core contribution to noncore interstate transition cost surcharges, elimina=
te=20
the core subscription
option as well as the caps for core aggregation programs.  The threshold fo=
r=20
participating in
core aggregation is reduced, and billing options are offered to core=20
aggregators.

Bilas=01, draft also warned that the commission may come back in two years =
to=20
open another
investigation into gas competition, taking into account any changes in mark=
et=20
conditions.
Bilas gave a little more insight into his decision in the text of the draft=
.
=01&The cost of gas as a commodity has vastly increased at the border, show=
ing a=20
differential
between the basin and border prices that is more than the cost of transport=
=20
and related services;
we question whether there will be an opportunity for discounting by markete=
rs=20
if more competition is allowed,=018=20
Bilas wrote in the draft decision.  =01&With half the state already committ=
ed to=20
a
restructured competitive natural gas industry, it suddenly seems as if the=
=20

structuring to enhance competition are speculative, particularly at this=20
time.  With one leg in the
water, the current has switched direction and it will be difficult, if not=

goals by forging ahead.

=01&We choose to take a cautious approach again,=018 the draft continues. =
=01&Rather=20
than proceeding
to unbundle transmission in Southern California now, we approve, with=20
modifications, the settle-

the costs to most ratepayers.=018

Eyes of Texas

A cowpoke in West Texas was herding cattle one day when he heard faint
music coming from nearby. After hunting about for a time, he discovered
the sound was loudest near one particular calf, and was even louder near
the calf's tail. Putting his head close to the calf's hind end, he heard
"The eyes of Texas are upon you, all the live long day..."

Amazed, he tossed the calf over his horse's back, mounted and rode
quickly to his line shack 10 miles away. There he put the calf into his
truck and drove 74 miles to Ft. Stockton, where he took the animal to a
vet.  When the vet asked him what was going on, the cowpoke told him,
and the vet went around behind the calf and gave a listen, too. He
agreed he heard "The eyes of Texas are upon you, you cannot get away..."
but didn't seem particularly excited.

"Man, how can you stand there and not be amazed?" the cowpoke asked.

The vet, a third generation Aggie, said, "Bud, I'm an Aggie, and I've
been listening to assholes sing the "Eyes of Texas" for years.

Attached is a revised draft of TW's capacity option filing.  I thought the 
comments I received last week were very helpful, and pursuant to our 
discussion I've added language addressing rates, limitation of liability, and 
the necessary exception to Commission policy.  Some of the language will 
probably need to be expanded or changed.  I have also included a section in 
the tariff cross-referencing applicable General Terms and Conditions.  The 
letter and tariff sheets are redlined; I did not make significant changes to 
the agreement.

I have not come up with a projected filing date yet; I believe it is 
important first to plan our pre-filing communication with customers as well 
as informal discussions with FERC staff.  I will be contacting some of you to 
coordinate these efforts, and this should help us decide on a reasonable date.

Market Services:  Because this filing is still just a draft and may change 
based on what we hear from customers, I will just continue to keep you in the 
loop and will leave it up to you to decide when and with whom to meet in 
order to get the information you need.

Please let me know your substantive questions and comments on the attached 
before next Wednesday if possible.  

Thank you.

Enron talking points....


Factors Leading to Higher Natural Gas Prices this Winter

? Demand for natural gas has increased mainly due to consumption in the power 
generation market and strength of the manufacturing sector in a booming 
economy.

? Natural gas production and drilling has fallen off since 1998 due to low 
prices that reached far below $2 per MMBtu.  In 2000, deliverability 
utilization will be over 95 percent.

? While drilling activity has risen sharply (as much as 50% from last year), 
the production from this increased drilling activity typically is not 
available for several months.  According to the AGA, supply production 
continues to run 16% below last year's levels.

? The past three winters have been "warmer than normal" winters in the 
Midwest and much of the United States and Canada, artificially masking the 
usual consumption of natural gas under "normal" weather situations. 

? Very warm weather during this summer has caused a significant demand 
increase for natural gas in the electricity generation sector thereby 
competing for gas storage injections in the marketplace and driving prices 
upward.

? U.S. storage inventory levels are lower than historical average levels from 
the past six years, according to the AGA.  The cost of storage inventory at 
this summer's strong prices could eliminate the price advantage traditionally 
experienced in the winter.

? Other heating fuels like propane and heating oil are also showing 
significantly higher prices and potentially lower stocks this winter than 
last.

Below are some notes taken while conversing with several TW customers on the 
various reasons prices have risen so dramatically out West.

El Paso line 1103 is still out of service from the August 2000 explosion.  
The remaining 2 lines are still operating at reduced flow levels taking 
200-300,000/d capacity off the market.

Storage levels in California were low to begin with.  With several coal and 
nuclear generation plants off-line (unplanned outages), the gas-burning 
generators have been running all out.

Northwest Pipeline has instituted several OFO's this month requiring shippers 
not to overpull the pipeline.  Penalty gas was selling for $22.00/MMBtu.

Beginning in November, SoCal Gas instituted its 5-day balancing requirement.  
This was not an unplanned event in the marketplace, however, it seems several 
entities were caught short early in the month and still haven't caught up.

LDC's east of California have experienced some dramatic weather but not 
severe.  They have been impacted more by firm demand to California knocking 
off IT and Alternate Firm supply destined for points east of California.  
SouthWest Gas has several alternate supply contracts with these LDC's and is 
collecting 150% of the market price from these LDC's by using SWG's full 
requirements contract on El Paso.

In addition, we now believe SoCal Gas is playing some storage games with the 
interstate pipes.  SoCal lowered their window on us for tomorrow to 580,000 
down from 750,000 due to "lower projected gas demand".  Sempra, Reliant, 
Dynegy, and Texaco are calling foul.  The thought is SoCal demand may be 
falling but instead of taking excess gas to replenish storage, SoCal is 
preventing higher-priced gas from reaching storage.

Yesterday's meeting concluded that real time fuel project should use socket 
to communicate
wtih SCADA to be in sync with other real time application in the group. 
Steve Littel sent his VB codes to me and I am working on it.

I asked Joe Zhou about TW Deal Analysis on Window 2000.  He said there should 
be no problem.
Window 2000 should have IE 5.0 features.

Executed firm transport contract with Oneok at maximum tariff rate for 
California deliveries.  Took advantage of widening market basis spreads; will 
generate $2.7 million in revenue.  Because the original terms had ROFR 
language dictating up to max rate only, included was a revenue sharing 
mechanism if contract is ever released above max rate.  The mechanism 
provides an opportunity to generate market based transport. 
Settled dispute with Burlington involving volume commitments under various 
pipeline pressures.  Dispute was originally at $3 million dollars, negotiated 
potential damages down to $100,000 in credits on prior transport invoices.  
Deal also included re-execution of Interconnect and Operating Agreement for 
lower volume commitments based on seasonality, thereby eliminating future 
potential dollar exposure.
Completed new facility interconnect with EOG for additional 30,000/day of 
supply on east end of system.  Potential opportunity for future transport or 
park and ride agreement.
Worked with Accounts Receivable to identify outstanding facility invoices.  
Located over $600,000 on Northern.  
Executed agreement with Cima Energy to be a new customer on Transwestern.
Worked as liaison with programmers to enhance Deal Profitability system.  
System now is also linked with the Risk Management System with weekly basis 
quote feed to ensure more real time data.
Co-ordinated Open Seasons with internal and external contacts.  Worked with 
programmers to enhance IOS system to handle maximum rate bidding and other 
e-commerce efforts.
Provide backup to both Short Term deal origination and contract processing.
Working with Eprime and SPS on potential power plant interconnect of up to 
200,000/day on east end of system.
Working with Eprime to become a new shipper on system from San Juan to East 
of Thoreau.
Monitor daily basis differentials to maximize additional transport rate 
opportunities.
Working with Market Services and Contract Administration to identify 
underutilized transport agreements for additional marketing opportunities.

Omaha Facility Planning has developed a hydraulic flow model for NGPL's pipe 
system based on Ferc Form 567 data and other publicly available info.  They 
are also working on one for ANR.  The purpose was so Marketing could 
anticipate the competitive threat as they looked at supply proposals for new 
power plants.  Now that we know the tool exists, we may want a model built 
for El Paso's system sometime in the near future.  Let me know if you feel 
it's worth pursuing and I'll get hold of Terry Galassini.

PG&E Sues to Recover $3 Billion 

Exploring yet another legal avenue, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Wednesday 
filed in San Francisco's federal district court asking for a judicial ruling 
that will mandate that it can recover all of the nearly $3 billion in 
uncollected wholesale electricity costs that have been mounting since May 
when price spikes in Califonia's market left the state's major investor-owned 
utilities vulnerable because their retail power rates are frozen at 1996 
levels. 

The utility argued that the wholesale power costs are federally approved, 
therefore, it filed in federal court. Earlier in the fall, PG&E appealed to 
the California Supreme Court, asking to overturn a California Public 
Utilities Commission decision this summer that limits its ability to recover 
its wholesale costs, which it passes on to customers without adding a profit 
charge. 

"We're just keeping our legal options open," said a San Francsco-based 
utility spokesperson, noting that the utility also is attempting to protect 
its financial status, which was challenged Tuesday when Fitch placed it and 
another California utility on a "rating negative watch." 

State and federal officials all acknowledge as part of a series of ongoing 
investigations that California's current wholesale electricity market is 
broken and noncompetitive in its current state, said Roger Peters, senior 
vice president and general counsel for Pacific Gas and Electric. "However, 
there has not yet been any concrete action by regulators to provide for 
recovery of the costs we have incurred to purchase the power our customers 
must have, either through refunds from power sellers who charged unfair 
prices, or through retail rates. These costs are continuing to grow." 

Noting both the unfairness and unpopularity of the skyrocketing wholesale 
charges, PG&E's utility nevertheless said it has a legal right to recover the 
charges from its almost four million customers, and it reiterated five steps 
it has taken to "increase supply, moderate customer demand, repair the broken 
wholesale market and provide stable, reasonable rates."

Texas Power Plants to Add 2,775 MW this Month

    Five power plants with 2,775 MW of new generating capacity are
being tested in the ERCOT and all should be operating commercially
before the end of this month. The 500 MW Unit 2 at FPL's Lamar
County plant is expected to be commercial soon. Calpine's 545 MW
expansion of its Pasadena plant in Harris County is running but has 
not yet gone commercial. LG&E Power Services' 400 MW Gregory Power
Partners plant in San Patricio County and American National Power's 
500 MW Midlothian plant in Ellis County are set to go commercial 
within days. The 830 MW Tenaska Frontier plant in Grimes County has 
been testing since May and is also set to go.

DealBench

Enron Net Works' newest initiative is now online!  

The Product
DealBenchTM is an online platform that enables licensing companies to arrange 
and execute transactions  efficiently and effectively.  Companies that 
license DealBenchTM are able to organize their transaction materials, upload 
documents and other materials to a secure website, invite deal participants 
to view deal materials, host various types of online auctions and manage, 
track and close a transaction online.  
DealBenchTM incorporates five specific business tools that streamline the 
transaction process for licensees:
Document Sharing:   deal-related materials in various formats (Word, 
Powerpoint, Excel, CAD drawings, digital pictures,      etc.) can be uploaded 
for deal participants to view and/or edit.

Auctioning/Bidding:   licensees can design and monitor (in real-time) forward 
or reverse auctions and collect sealed tender      bids.

Multi-media:    customers can present high quality virtual road shows and 
asset descriptions using streaming video.

Secure Communication:  DealLineTM messaging system facilitates one-to-one, 
one-to-many, and many-to-many        communication.

Deal Management:   DealNotesTM  enables customers to monitor the progress of 
their deals using statistics on user      downloads, bidding/auction results 
and user page views.


Applications
DealBenchTM has been used by Enron during bank product syndications, the sale 
of a large portfolio of leases, and the procurement of certain materials for 
the new headquarters building.   Soon, DealBenchTM will also meet the 
collaboration needs of Enron attorneys, facilitate online RFQs and provide 
for the hosting of online datarooms.  

To learn more about DealBenchTM, please join eSpeak on Wednesday October 4th 
when Harry Arora (Vice-President, eCommerce) will answer questions regarding 
this Enron Net Works initiative.  For additional information, please visit 
https://www.DealBench.com (username= guest, password= dealbench) or email 
webmaster@DealBench.com.
NOTE:  If you are unable to execute the above link, please copy the link into 
the address line of your installed browser.

We welcome all thoughts and ideas on how the DealBench platform can be 
utilized to address the needs of Enron's business units.  Further, as the 
platform is available to be licensed externally, please forward new business 
development leads to members of the    DealBenchTM team.

Western Undeterred By Grueling Regulatory Process

Expressing frustration but continuing its resolve, Texas-based Western Hub 
Properties is ironing out some "technical issues" of financing with 
California regulators and now expects to start construction in February on 
its delayed Lodi gas storage field in northern California. 

The merchant storage project will be operating by this time next year, said 
Western Hub's California-based manager, Jim Fossum, who added that with 
faster approvals, the project could have been in service during this summer's 
electricity generating crunch and the current gas and power shortages. 

Despite the regulatory struggle, he said the company still plans to go 
through with its other California storage project near Bakersfield and the 
natural gas hub called Wheeler Ridge. Western has acquired leases on the 
property it needs and will start more detailed engineering of the proposed 
site over the first three to six months of next year. The company intends to 
make a filing with state regulators in summer of 2001. 

In both the approved Lodi project (see Daily GPI, May 19) and the proposed 
Wheeler Ridge storage field, Western is not concerned about lining up 
customers, said Fossum. The projects are not contingent on contracts, he 
said. "Now that we are a bona fide (certified plant) utility under the 
California Public Utilities Commission, we are getting some technical things 
worked out with the commission staff and nailing down the last small pieces 
of property, Fossum said. "Everything is basically ready to go at Lodi" 

"We have to file with them documents that verify certain aspects of the 
project's financing. We can't move ahead with the financing until the CPUC 
approves it. 

"If we had not encountered all of the roadblocks that we have had, we could 
have helped with the problems this last summer, and we could be helping with 
problems right now." He added that the project would not be operational in 
time to have any impact on the upcoming summer electricity demand and 
corresponding heavy natural gas demand to fuel power plants. 

Lodi and the Wheeler Ridge storage project are being designed as 
high-deliverability storage facilities. Lodi will have about 9 Bcf of working 
capacity, building to 12 Bcf. Initially, Fossum said, Lodi should have about 
400 MMcf/d injection capability and 500 MMcf/d withdrawal. 

In the southern half of the state, Western for some time has been doing 
reservoir studies near Wheeler Ridge and now has a "couple of reservoirs that 
we think might work," Fossum said. "We're in the preliminary planning phase." 

The Wheeler Ridge project would have an ultimate working capacity of 12 to 16 
Bcf and similar 500 MMcf/d deliverability at its peak. He said Western hopes 
to have something operational in the Wheeler Ridge area by the end of 2002.

Most people want to work well with others.  But most were raised in families 
where conflict did not bring them closer.  We come to work with two habitual 
ways of dealing with difficult relationships -- to attack or to withdraw.  We 
tend to avoid addressing differences with our co-workers and especially with 
our supervisors.  Information is not shared, dangers are not discussed, and 
mistakes are ignored.  The individual can become overwhelmingly stressed.  
The organiziation suffers loss of respect and trust and risks financial 
loss.  The Successful Working Relationships seminar series provides a range 
of practical tools and techniques that will help you build a more supportive 
environment in which you will actually look forward to working each day.  


Successful Working Relationships - Valuing Differences
October 3, 2000    8:30am -4:30pm  in  EB552    $600.00 

Organizations are like "step-families".  People come together with different 
backgrounds, perceptions, and preferences.  These different habits of 
attitude and behaviour can be the sources of much confusion and frustration.  
Using a unique approach to the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) through 
entertaining examples and informative exercises, this program teaches the 
strengths inherent in the various personality types. This module emphasizes 
the importance of not being pigeonholed in any particular category, but

Michelle:

The intial agreement Bob presented to EOG was for $10,000, this was to cover 
the cost to refurbishing the existing 6" tap.  The work order was generated 
with this amount so that the R-O-W folks would intiate a Landowner 
notification letter ASAP.  EOG estimated a 5 - 15 mmcfd volume and they were 
to supply all materials to re-activate this point.   A scope change was 
intiated and we were to supply the EFM for their meter tube,  a verbal cost 
estimate to Bob in the amount of $35,000 was relayed.  A third scope change 
raised the volume estimate to over 20 mmcfd, which normally means we install 
additional instrumentation.  Operations at this time insisted we add the 
needed equipment to the work order.  The E&C folks then put out the tighter 
cost estimate of $422,000.  This included the following cost revisions:

 Chromatograph     $55,000
 H2O Monitor     $10,000
 H2S Monitor     $35,000
 EFM      $35,000
 Flow control     $34,000
 Positive shut-in     $22,000
 Flow bypass     $12,000
 Engi. CSUP, Contig.  $120,000
 Tax Gross-up   $100,000 
  Total   $423,000

Call me if you have any questions, PT 3-0667.

One of the deliverables of Revenue Management is the Marketing Dashboard 
which, among a veritable cornucopia of features, will include live Nymex and 
Enron OnLine data pricing feeds.  The rollout of the Dashboard for NNG and TW 
is in the next 2 weeks.  However, the Nymex data feed won't happen till 
August due to technology limitations.  

In the meantime, via our desktops, we all have access to Enron OnLine which 
provides live market data that is as good or better than Nymex.  This should 
suffice in the interim till the Dashboard is fully functional.  Let me know 
if you have questions.

thanks

Richard, I took the liberty of reformatting your imbalance spreadsheet a 
little to be able to sort the numbers by volume and dollar amount (see 
attached). 

As you update the numbers, would you please send the info to all market team 
members as well (see above).  We want to be more proactive in managing the 
imbalances and staying on top of those operator / shippers that are gaming TW.

thanks

Subject: TW Cash for Fuel Issues

Christine,

After our meeting last week, John, Elizabeth, Gerry, Richard, Dave & I 
discussed various options related to this cash for fuel process. We had 
several open issues that came up in our discussions and they are as follows:

Regulatory/Legal issue: Can we have contract specific language on our firm 
contracts that would prevent the firm shipper from releasing this fuel 
discount  cash option to an acquiring shipper?     If we must offer this 
special cash option to the acquiring shipper we will need to build a process 
to track this fuel option from the firm shipper to the releasing shipper. 
This will require more system modifications that we have not accounted for at 
this time.

Shipper nomination issue: How will we handle shipper nomination line items 
that are nominated as overrun paths on their firm contracts?  Could we 
default these "02" overrun transactions to calculate the fuel in kind using 
our existing tariff fuel %?  This would  make the process of trying to 
reconcile the contracted MDQ fuel volumes easier when we verify that the 
volumes the shipper elected to pay in cash tie back to the total volumes 
scheduled & paid for in cash..

Tariff Sheet issue:  When you state in the tariff provision that "The shipper 
may use the cash for fuel option only if the posted point of sale is a 
receipt point on shipper's service agreement" Does this only apply to the 
shipper's primary receipt points?

I would appreciate it if you could respond to these issues. If you feel like 
we should meet to discuss, I will be glad to set up another meeting. Please 
let me know.

Thanks Ramona

No quick fix for soaring California gas prices
In the past year, gas prices in most regions have doubled and in some cases=

The most obvious cause of the dramatic escalation is scarcity of gas.  The=

demand

transmission constraints on regional pipelines.

Improving deliverability into Southern California is key to bringing the=20

the region, including Kern River Gas Transmission, El Paso Natural Gas and=

Those problems had come to a head in part because of high summer prices tha=

Amoco - Amoco has changed its name to BP Energy.  Two deals with BP Energy 
were closed late last Friday:

Ignacio to Blanco
18,000 MMBtu/d January, 2001
22,000 MMBtu/d Feb - Dec, 2001
retains ROFR
rate:  $0.07

Red Cedar to Blanco
21,200 MMBtu/d
Feb 1, 2001 - Dec 31, 2001
$0.045

Southwest Gas - Marketing and Market Services met with reps from SWG to 
discuss finalizing an OBA (we will use the currently effective OBA rather 
than the 637 filed OBA), nominations, scheduling and capacity release.  This 
is in preparation for their new firm transport agreement beginning November 1.

El Paso Field Services -  We have finalized the terms with EPFS for a new 
receipt point in Eddy County, NM.  EPFS will pay $190,000 towards the total 
cost of the interconnect of $330,000 (these figures include tax gross-up).  
TW will construct, own, operate and maintain the new interconnect which will 
tie into the high pressure line of the West Texas lateral.  The estimated 
in-service date is Jan. 1, 2001.  EPFS has committed to flow incremental 
supplies of 12,500 MMBtu/d for a 2 year commitment through the new point.

El Paso Blanco Mis-Measurement - EP made some minor adjustments to the 
language in our settlement letter; final versions were sent out for 
execution.  They have already begun delivering the gas back to TW at Window 
Rock.  If the flow remains high, the payback may be complete before EP goes 
down for maintenance at the end of October otherwise we will complete the 
transaction in early November.   We sold 15,000 MMBtu/d of the volume for 
October to USGT/Aquila at $5.20/MMBtu.

Park 'n Ride - The new automated allocation procedures were implemented this 
week so customers can automatically nominate volume and the system will 
handle any necessary allocations.

For the short Thanksgiving week of  November 20th-November 22th:

Transwestern weekly average deliveries to California were 941 MMcf/d (86% - 
due to pipeline maintenance) while east deliveries averaged 310 MMcf/d.  San 
Juan lateral throughput averaged 789 MMcf/d while receipts from Rio Puerco 
averaged 27 MMcf/d.  

El Paso average deliveries to California were 2,491 MMcf/d (85%) :
- PG&ETop (capacity 1,140 MMcf/d) deliveries averaged 495 MMcf/d (70%)
- SoCalEhr (capacity 1,250 MMcf/d) deliveries averaged 1,102 MMcf/d (88%)
- SoCalTop (capacity 549 MMcf/d) deliveries averaged 521 MMcf/d (97%)


Other pipeline throughput to California:
- PGT ( capacity 1,901 MMcf/d) throughput to California averaged 1,627 MMc/d 
(86%).   
-  Kern River (total pipeline capacity 700) throughput to California averaged 
225 MMcf/d (32%). The remaining 475 MMcf/d  (68%) is assumed delivered to the 
Las Vegas market.


The cash PG&E/Topock - SoCal/Needles spread went from  $.80 Monday spread to 
to a $1.23 Wednesday level.

Daily Cash prices were absolutely wild this week at the southern California 
border.  Monday's cash price of $13.42 went to $17.35 by Wednesday.  San Juan 
and Permian cash prices each had some increase and by Wednesday were  $6.32 
and $6.40, respectively.  This price spike occurred despite the fact that 
total California sendout (sum of interstate gas, intrastate production & 
storage withdrawals) decreased from last week's 7.6 BCF/day level to this 
week's level of 7.2 BCF/day.     

 Wednesday Enron Online Basis financial spread numbers:

  Dec  Dec 00-March '01 April-Oct '01

Kim,

You might want to get on the distribution of this report.  I have wondered 
and asked the question "Do we always cover variable operating costs on our 
park and ride deals"?  A ride can have a very negative impact on fuel use.  
Doesn't the Deal Analysis cover park & ride deals?  You might want to check 
into this.

Thanks........Terry

Lindy and Michelle--

Thanks for taking the time to meet with me yesterday to discuss DealBench and 
the IOS process.  I will work with my technical team to schedule a meeting 
sometime next week with you and Rich Abromowitz. 

Michelle-- when you get a chance, can you please fax to my attention the 
screen shots from an IOS auction that contained some of the complexities we 
discussed yesterday?  I have verified that Enron Net Works is a separate 
legal entity from ENA so I think we are okay from that standpoint.  My fax 
number is 713-646-8576.

Thanks so much,

Ross Mesquita

Deals Closed--
 --Arizona Public Service - We sold 14,000 MMBtu/d to APS for April  - Oct, 
2001 from EOT - Topock for $0.23.  This was the space we had tried   to sell 
using the IOS last week.  The high bid then had been $.138/MMBtu and we 
rejected the offer.  APS had not been a bidder in the IOS.

 --CIMA Energy agreed to an IT agreement for 5000 MMBtu/d on the Crawford 
lateral.  This is an East-to-East deal at $0.065 plus fuel for 14 months   
beginning Sept 2000.  This new shipper on TW will generate additional revenue 
(had shipped under a Duke FT for $0.02).

 --Texaco has agreed to extend its contract from Red Cedar to Blanco from 
January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2002 at $0.045.

 --Red Cedar - We have a verbal agreement on a 5 year deal with Red Cedar.  
Final details are being negotiated but the volume would range from  100,000 
to 150,000 MMBtu/d.  We will need to spend approximately $375,000 to expand 
the metering capability of the Arkansas loop.

 --Sempra has agreed to an FT agreement for Ignacio to Blanco for 30,000 
MMBtu/d.  The term is calendar 2001 for a $.06 rate.  We have approximately  
30,000 MMBtu/d of remaining space available.

Burlington Resources - Burlington claims we are limiting production from 
their Val Verde Plant because TW is unable to fully accept all the 
nominations of gas under the current operating agreement.  They claim 
approximately $135,000/month in lost revenues.  We are pulling together the 
data on exactly which days we have not been able to take BR's gas.  Thus far 
BR has rejected our revised wording in the interconnect amendment, 
specifically "best efforts" and "subject to operating conditions on TW", so 
we will need to revise this further.  We offered alternate receipt point 
flexibility at Ignacio and alternate delivery point flexibility at El Paso 
Blanco on their Jackrabbit contract but they do not think this is sufficient 
to agree to amend the interconnect agreement.  They have suggested we 
consider giving them a deeper discount on their San Juan - Waha contract 
(80,000/d, $0.14, term 11/30/06) but this is not acceptable to TW.  We are 
evaluating all options.

SouthWest Gas notified us they are within 90 days of being capable of 
receiving gas through the new interconnect in Nevada.  Under the terms of the 
agreement, we are now obligated to pay SWG the remaining CAIC of $417,500.

Transport Options Tariff--  Meetings were held this week with customers and 
internal personnel to flange up remaining details of how the  program will 
function.

Mid-year Employment Reviews were completed for all Team Members this week.

Enron's Lay Urges Bold Solutions to Power Market Woes

As the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission prepared to weigh in this morning 
with the federal government's answer to California's be-deviled power market, 
free market advocates issued last minute warnings against taking the price 
cap route espoused by the Cal-ISO. FERC's meeting is scheduled to start at 9 
AM EST. (Check http://intelligencepress.com this morning for updates) 

In a letter fired off to FERC Chairman James J. Hoecker yesterday, Enron CEO 
Kenneth Lay urged the Commission to find a fix for the underlying structural 
problems in the power market rather than follow the steps of policy makers 
who have placed "price cap 'band aids' over hemorrhaging wounds." 

Lay told Hoecker the power market is "halfway across a busy street in its 
transition from monopoly to competition. It can't stand where it is." He said 
FERC has to make a choice between falling into the "same trap of political 
expediency as California's ISO, leaving the nation's electric system in the 
lurch from one crisis to the next, [o]r it can take a big step toward 
fundamental structural reform." 

At the same time the Electric Power Supply Association (EPSA) called on FERC 
to issue an emergency cease and desist order prohibiting the Cal-ISO from 
"unilaterally implementing" any changes to its current $250/MWh price cap for 
wholesale electricity purchases. In a motion filed Monday, the marketer group 
specifically asked the Commission to bar the Cal-ISO board of directors from 
putting into effect its decision to impose a fiendishly complex 
load-differentiated price cap of $100 or less during the off-peak season 
effective Nov. 3. The plan was designed by the state's main utility consumer 
group (see Daily GPI, Oct. 30). In addition, the EPSA urged FERC to "state 
explicitly" that the Cal-ISO does not have the authority to impose or extend 
price or bid caps, unless expressly authorized to do so by the Commission. 
The Cal-ISO's current authority to set price caps expires on Nov. 15. 

Lay said the Cal-ISO's complicated new formula caps prices below the cost of 
gas-fired generation, "making obvious errors such as failing to take into 
account gas transportation costs between the Henry Hub and power plants in 
California; in doing so the bid cap makes it more economic for generators to 
sell their gas supply, rather than use it to make electricity in California." 
The new formula also forces the ISO into the market to buy power on an ad hoc 
basis "to keep the lights on when the capped market fails to attract 
sufficient supplies (which it inevitably will do)," Lay said. In addition, 
the capped formula "invites generators to shut in production, export power 
out of state and deploy their turbines in other states or countries." 

He noted that the ISO's Chairman voted against the measure while all of the 
state's utilities voted for it "presumably knowing full well that it simply 
will not work." 

California is "just the latest failure of partial or compromised open 
access," said Lay. "It's time for the Commission to reject this approach. 

"The power industry --- the nation's most essential industry --- is mired in 
the transition from regulated monopoly to open access and customer choice. 
Every step forward has been compromised out of concern for alienating one 
vested interest or another. As a result, utilities are free to slow the 
interconnection of new generation, withhold equal access to the transmission 
system, favor their own sales over those of competitors, miscalculated 
available transmission capacity, and exercise control over supposedly 
'independent' system operators and reliability organizations. 

Lay predicted that installing price caps for political expediency would 
"plunge markets into greater uncertainty and discourage new supplies and 
conservation methods..." 

FERC has to complete the work that it started, said Lay. It has to ensure 
that all parties have equal and fair access to transmission by "ending the 
special priority for utility uses of the system. Second, FERC must require 
transmission owners to separate operation of the monopoly transmission assets 
from their other businesses. Third, FERC must take politics out of 
transmission system operations by revising governance structures to ensure 
independence. Finally, FERC must end its reliance on shortsighted price caps 
by putting in place the necessary reforms to allow these markets to operate 
efficiently to encourage conservation and attract new supplies." 

EPSA said the Cal-ISO board "acted in obvious disregard for the Commission's 
orderly processes." It "cannot be permitted to make the Commission's 
decisions for it, or to alter so radically market rules, thereby injecting 
more uncertainty and confusion in the market and subverting the process for 
fashioning fair, effective and comprehensive remedies" for California's 
"flawed" electric markets, the group noted. 

The EPSA believes that any remedial actions taken by FERC with respect to the 
California markets will be "severely compromised" if the Cal-ISO board's 
imposition of new prices caps is allowed to take effect.

Title: Monthly Briefing: In a High Range
Author: N. American Gas Team
E-Mail Category: Alert

**********************************************************************

Gas prices remain within a high range, with prices volatile between 
approximately $3.75 and $4.50 per million British thermal units (MMBtu). 
Prices are likely to remain within this high band through the fall, until the 
uncertainty of early winter weather resolves itself. At the lower end of this 
range--and with oil prices in the upper $20s per barrel or higher--price 
support kicks in as end users begin to switch back toward gas or to 
reactivate industrial demand. Gas prices may flirt with the lower boundary so 
long as the weather is not too hot across too many regions, allowing storage 
injections to increase and providing hopes for an adequately supplied winter. 
Above-normal heat in only one or two regions, however, or even the threat of 
storms in the Gulf of Mexico will pull prices quickly upward. As for the 
upper boundary, although prices in specific regions such as California and 
the Northeast may reach above $5.00, an actual storm in the Gulf or more 
widespread heat than!
 has yet occurred this summer appears required to pull the Henry Hub much 
above $4.50.

Absent tropical storm activity in the Gulf of Mexico, CERA expects prices to 
settle into the lower portion of this band during September (see Table 1). 
Although strong power loads and the resulting weak injection rates are likely 
to sustain prices through much of August, the seasonal decline in generation 
demand into September should allow storage injections to increase by 1.5 
billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day. As a result, CERA expects prices to settle 
somewhat, averaging $3.95 per MMBtu at the Henry Hub during September. 
However, the larger fundamental force in the market remains unchanged: 
supplies are adequate with any certainty only for another warm winter. Any 
interruption in supply or abnormal demand will quickly drive prices upward; 
next month may represent the low for the remainder of the year.

Gas Storage--Not Yet Enough

Mild weather over much of the United States during July allowed a much-needed 
recovery in storage injections, with the estimated injection rate increasing 
by nearly 2.5 Bcf per day from year-earlier levels (see Table 2). This rate 
was enabled entirely by lower demand, however, and not added supply. The 
result is that under more normal summer weather conditions during August, the 
US storage inventory deficit is likely to remain stubbornly near 350 Bcf. 
Although the deficit is likely to decline on average during August, it is 
even more likely to expand again during September, especially should any 
storm necessitate evacuation of offshore platforms. Absolute inventories and 
supply adequacy for this winter therefore remain a concern in the market.

Inventories are unlikely to reach levels adequate to prevent record lows from 
occurring next spring. Should injections continue as expected, inventories 
would reach approximately 2,750 Bcf by October 31; but reaching even this 
level, still an all-time low annual maximum inventory, requires some help 
from a lack of storm activity and a lack of heating load in October. Storage 
inventories are not yet sufficient to relieve market pressure and are 
unlikely to become so by the beginning of the heating season.

Regional Markets--Western Disconnects Continue

Wide differentials emerged this summer in the West and look likely to persist 
through September. In Southern California record summer demand levels have 
pushed pipeline flows to new highs. Topock continues to be the premium 
pricing point in North America. In the Rockies supply growth has pushed up 
pipeline flows out of the region. Power loads should ease somewhat in 
Southern California, and that easing will bring some decline in the Topock 
premium. Pressure on Rocky Mountains and San Juan prices should persist until 
the start of the heating season in late October (see Table 3).

CERA's outlook by region follows:

*  Rockies. Pipeline capacity out of the Rockies is running nearly full to 
every export market except the San Juan Basin. Emerging pipeline bottlenecks 
should keep differentials wide during September, with an average differential 
of $0.75 per MMBtu.

*  San Juan. In the San Juan increased imports from the Rocky Mountains and 
high utilization rates on capacity into California are pressuring prices. 
CERA expects differentials to average $0.55 per MMBtu for the month of 
September. San Juan differentials will narrow more substantially when Rocky 
Mountain pipeline bottlenecks are relieved by increases in heating demand 
during the fourth quarter.

*  Permian and Mid-Continent. Strong power loads in Texas have supported 
Permian Basin prices during July and August. Persistent power demand is 
expected to keep differentials around $0.08 per MMBtu for September. 
Mid-Continent prices should average just under Permian prices.

*  Chicago. Steady storage injection loads are unlikely to support prices at 
Chicago in the face of declining power generation into September. July 
premiums of $0.06 to $0.07 have already come down in early August and are 
likely to remain low, at approximately $0.03 for September.

*  Northeast markets. Northeast price premiums have averaged from the 
mid-$0.20s to the mid-$0.30s, depending on generation load and proximity to 
the New York Facilities Group major meters. CERA expects little to change 
this relationship, but as generation loads decline into September, premiums 
could move closer to the fuel cost floor, the mid- to high $0.20s.

Canadian Markets--Supply Growth Still Disappointing

Although June displayed year-over-year growth in production in western 
Canada, July reverted to a decline, and August is running close to last 
year's level. The current expectation is for over 15,500 well completions in 
2000, approximately 9,200 of which are expected to be gas wells. Even if the 
trend toward shallow drilling does not change substantially, the sheer number 
of wells is expected to produce a supply build by year-end and into 2001. For 
2000, the total western Canadian supply build is expected to be flat with 
1999, increasing to a positive growth of 350 MMcf per day in 2001.

Demand Slow but Exports Up

TransCanada flows are down 275 MMcf per day on average for 2000 but have been 
down by over 350 MMcf per day so far in the third quarter. PG&E GT-NW volumes 
were up by over 300 MMcf per day in June and July but have dropped to 
year-earlier levels in August and are expected to remain close to last year's 
levels for September. Northern Border Pipeline is operating at rates similar 
to last year's on average in 2000 but is expected to decrease about 50 MMcf 
per day for the third quarter. Western Canadian demand is currently up 
slightly, driven by the warmer-than-normal weather in late July and early 
August, but should be closer to 1999 levels in September.

High Prices: Wide Differentials

The AECO-Henry differential has widened quite dramatically over the past few 
months from the low US$0.30s of the first quarter to US$0.84 in July. The 
differential increased to well over a dollar in the second week of August, 
but the driver for that increase was maintenance that reduced the export 
capacity at Empress. August and September are expected to average in the 
mid-$0.80s.

AECO is expected to average C$4.67 per gigajoule (GJ) (US$3.35 per MMBtu) for 
August, with September softening to C$4.53 per GJ (US$3.25 per MMBtu) for a 
third quarter average of C$4.54 per GJ (US$3.25 per MMBtu).

Gary,
Changes related to TW basis differential for TW Deal Analysis is completed. 
Michelle Lokay has reviewed the new index price using the new tables and 
logic.  
The migration does not  impact other applications.  Please approve it and 
forward
it to Margaret Waters mail box.    

Margaret,
Per your instruction, these are things we need for this migration.

1. Delete view rms_basis_nymex_view on ETSMOE.gpgrms and ETSHOUSP09.gpgrms
2. Create new view view rms_basis_nymex_partial_view on ETSMOE.gpgrms and 
ETSHOUSP09.gpgrms
3. Modify  the Ashwin job:  DBA MOJO misc:  twprod01.rms_basis_load  to pull 
from the new view
4. Migrate stored procedures 
    mchen.up_TWDA_create_path
    mchen.up_TWDA_deal_analysis
    in etstest/twprod01 to dbo in etstest/twprod01, etsmo/twprod01, and 
mojo/twprod01.
    Grant exec to developers in etstest.
    Grant exec to TWDP in etsmo and mojo. 

Thanks,

Mei-Ling,

I put the index table on ETSTEST.twprod01, ETSMO.twprod01, and MOJO.twprod01 
and I have added a job to refresh the new table in production.  In 
development (ETSHOUSD11.GPGRMS) I have dropped the view rms_basis_nymex_view 
and created a new view  rms_basis_nymex_partial_view.  I have also loaded the 
data to ETSTEST.twprod01.  After you have tested and when you request the 
migration, please request the deletion of the view rms_basis_nymex_view on 
ETSMOE.gpgrms and ETSHOUSP09.gpgrms and the creation of the new view in these 
two environments.  Also request the modification of the Ashwin job:  DBA MOJO 
misc:  twprod01.rms_basis_load  to pull from the new view.

Please send the request directly to my mail box, I will complete and send to 
the ETS DBA mailbox as completed.

Yes, I need the same logic for "NYMEX" like the attached query.  For NYMEX, 
and the four new TW index,
I only need the most current data for the application.

Meiling,

Do you want the same logic you have in the attached query for the "NYMEX" 
also or like the current NYMEX selection do you want everything and you 
filter the most current?

Also for the future, creation of new tables require a database change form.

Thanks,

Margaret ,

The basis differential for TW is available in rms database now, I like to 
request a nightly download
from rms database to twprod01 database in etstest/etsmo/mojo.
You set up NYMEX price dowload to rms_basis for me ealier.
Since there are more than one type of index coming in this time, I think we 
also need rms_index in
Sybase side.

Attached is the sample sql from Ray Volpone.



Thanks,

The latest changes to the Interactive Open Season application have been moved 
into production and are ready for testing.  These modifications include:

Displaying the actual bids along with the evaluated bids on each of the 
detail lines.  This will allow shippers to see the actual bid rate for all 
bids greater than max rate.
Calculating the winning bids based on evaluated bid and term only (ignore 
time entered).  A " * " in the first column now means that the bid is a 
potential winner, not an actual winner.
Forcing shippers to bid on the full volume of the package.

The modifications do not include:

Allowing users to supersede any of their own bids greater than or equal to 
max rate.  Because this modification introduces a high risk factor, it will 
be made after Fiday's IOS.


Because some of these modifications affect the way in which bids are ranked, 
thorough testing by the Marketing team should be completed before any 
shippers are allowed to enter the system.

  GPG and EOTT Operations have joined together to explore the idea of 
combining the technical services and field operations of the two groups in 
order to reduce costs and capture available synergies.

 We will be spending the next 30 days or so evaluating the pros and cons of a 
combination, including the accounting, legal and human resources implications 
of such a partnership.  We will keep you up-to-date as efforts move forward.

As the heating season approaches, a high=01*but justified=01*level of anxie=

By now, exposure to extreme price volatility this winter is certain. Althou=

CERA expects storage injections to increase by approximately 2.0 billion cu=

inventories at record lows for this month and next. Even this increase in
injections will not occur if a tropical storm forces evacuation of offshore
platforms, or if hot weather returns.

For October, heating load enters the picture. With US supplies running clos=

year-earlier levels and imports slightly higher, demand priced out of the=

any threat of interruption in supplies will quickly bounce prices upward=20

therefore, CERA expects the reality of supply vulnerability for the winter =
to
result in the first ever monthly average price of $5.00 at the Henry Hub (s=
ee
Table 1) and the first of potentially many months at or above that price.

Gas Storage=01*New Record Lows
CERA estimates that storage inventories in the United States crossed into=
=20
record
low territory as of the end of August, when inventories of 2,233 Bcf fell=
=20
below
the previous 1996 record low of 2,245 Bcf (see Table 2). More records will
likely be broken in the coming months, and by widening margins. Injections =

September are expected to average 9.5 Bcf per day, an increase of 2.0 Bcf p=

day from the August level but below last year=01,s pace of 10.3 Bcf per day=

CERA=01,s September estimate could be exceeded under mild weather condition=
s
with no tropical activity hitting the Gulf of Mexico, but injections would=

likely
fall below the 9.5 Bcf per day rate should storm activity force evacuation =
of
platforms. This rate would leave US inventories at 2,518 Bcf at month=01,s =
end, a
record low by 87 Bcf.

For October, CERA expects a slight increase in the injection rate from last=

year.
Injections of 5.5 Bcf per day on average this year would be enabled by dema=
nd

storm activity. October injections have varied historically from 4.0 Bcf pe=
r=20
day
(1989) to 8.5 Bcf per day (1998). Even if injections reached toward the upp=
er
end of this range, the market would remain exposed to shortfalls during the
winter. At the expected injection rate, US inventories of 2,689 Bcf at the=

October would result in an end of March 2001 inventory level of 669 Bcf und=

Regional Markets=01*Waiting for Winter
The pipeline explosion on El Paso during late August intensified the=20
subregional
pressures already at play in western gas markets. Cuts in pipeline flows=20
limited
access into California on the only pipeline route into the state with any=

excess
capacity. The lack of supply pressured prices within the supply basins and
forced strong storage withdrawals in the California market. Although summer
power loads in California will ease and much of the El Paso capacity has be=
en
restored, the race to improve storage positions before the onset of winter=
=20
heating
load will keep intense pressure on Topock prices. Differentials in the rest=
=20
of the
West will strengthen as local heating loads begin to absorb enough supply t=
o
ease pipeline bottlenecks (see Table 3).

Differentials in the East, which have traded in a narrow range this summer,=
=20
will
likely reach slightly higher levels with the start of the heating season in=
=20
October.
However, exposure to pricing disconnects will remain low until later this=
=20
year.
CERA=01,s outlook by region follows:

* Rockies. Pipeline bottlenecks out of the Rocky Mountains
this summer should begin to ease as heating loads climb
during October. CERA expects that as local demand limits
pressure on pipeline capacity, differentials will narrow.
October differentials should average $0.50 per MMBtu.

* San Juan. The resumption of flows on El Paso=01,s southern
system, combined with production outages, has relieved
some of the access constraints on San Juan supply.
Seasonal declines in Rockies to Southwest flows and the
beginning of the heating season should narrow October
differentials to $0.35 per MMBtu.

* Permian and Mid-Continent. The continuing pull on
supplies from the West will support Permian prices, and the
Midwestern pull on supplies will support Mid-Continent
prices. CERA expects a differential to the Henry Hub of
$0.06 per MMBtu for Mid-Continent supplies and $0.11
per MMBtu for Permian supplies.

* Chicago. The delay in the in-service date for Alliance from
October 2 to October 30 will take some gas out of the
Chicago market next month. This delay, combined with the
need to build Midwest storage inventories, should sustain
the recent increase in differentials from the $0.05=01)$0.08
range to above $0.10 per MMBtu. CERA expects October
differentials at the Chicago citygate to average $0.11.

* Northeast markets. Gas prices near $5.00 have increased
the fuel cost of delivery from the Gulf Coast into the
Northeast, raising the floor level for differentials to near
$0.30 per MMBtu. The beginning of the heating season and
the lack of new capacity into the New York citygate should
support differentials above the floor during October, at near
$0.40 per MMBtu.

Canadian Markets=01*Outages Affect Supply
Outages have affected supply thus far in September. Both British Columbia a=

I have replace the old basis differential with Michelle's new numbers and 
migrated the program to
production.  So TW Deal Analysis is using the new basis differential now.

Gary,
Per user request, we need to replace basis differential for TW Deal Analysis 
forward pricing that was hard coded
in the program with the latest numbers as stated in the e-mail from Michelle 
Lokay.  We are working on
accessing the information from revenue management table as soon as the data 
is available in the database. 
This change does not impact any other applications.
Please approve it and forward this request to ets dba.

Re paragraph 8:  I just spoke with Mary Kay and Drew.  Because of FERC policy 
on negotiated rates, we have to be careful to characterize paragraph 8 as a 
bid evaluation method only.  Just because a shipper hits the max rate button 
does not mean they are committing to 100% throughput.  In order to commit to 
100% throughput, they need to submit a 2-part bid and indicate 100% 
throughput.  Does this make sense?  Let me know if there are any problems.

Recent events in California, culminating in new market rules established for 
the energy and ancillary services markets, indicate that legislators and 
regulators are dissatisfied with the performance of the markets they 
established. The hot weather in California during June triggered high 
electricity demand, corresponding record-breaking power prices, and rolling 
blackouts in the San Francisco area. Although the economic impact of both the 
outages and the concurrent price spikes is significant, a recent decision by 
California's Independent System Operator (ISO) to intervene in the markets by 
lowering price caps through the summer of 2000 from $750 to $500 per 
megawatt-hour (MWh) may prove to be the most important product of the market 
events.* Ironically, the proclivity to continue to change the market rules, 
whatever the intention, could create market distortions that delay the 
addition of new generating capacity by discouraging plant developers and 
driving away needed capit!
al. This would only prolong the state's supply shortage and resultant high 
prices.

Although the record-setting weather that prompted the rolling blackouts in 
the San Francisco area is not likely to be repeated, the West as a whole will 
experience higher coincident peak demand under normal weather conditions this 
summer. CERA expects that supplies will be sufficient to meet peak demand 
this year, but the high price levels of June will be repeated during peak 
demand conditions not only this summer but during the summers of 2001 and 
possibly 2002.

The Pressure Builds
The blackouts were not spawned by a statewide supply shortfall, but instead 
by a transmission constraint that limits the ability to import sufficient 
quantities of power to the San Francisco area. The quantity of generating 
capacity out of service in the West was near average levels, despite a 
nuclear unit outage in Washington. Although the blackouts were brief and 
wholesale power prices decreased with the temperatures, the intense scrutiny 
over the events and resultant changes to the market rules indicate that 
legislators and regulators are dissatisfied with the performance of the 
markets they designed. The market's architects assumed that competition would 
lower wholesale prices in the state. However, prices in June have been 
roughly eight times higher than in 1997's prerestructured California market, 
leading many regulators and legislators to conclude that the markets are 
flawed, requiring additional caps and market rules. Although some state 
officials strongly favored lo!
wering the price caps, many within the ISO's Board of Governors strongly 
opposed intervening in what they consider to be normal market reactions to 
tight supply and demand fundamentals.

The current tight supply situation in California and the West as a whole is a 
product of recent strong economic growth throughout the region coupled with 
the slow process of permitting new power plants. Owing to strong economic 
growth in California in 1998 and 1999 (5.2 and 5.5 percent, respectively*), 
capacity margins have shrunk from 12 percent in 1997 to 7 percent in 2000. 
Demand growth throughout the West has reduced the amount of energy available 
for export from the Pacific Northwest and Southwest to California.

As a result, even with optimistic levels of energy imports and the 
curtailment of approximately 2,800 megawatts (MW) of interruptible load 
within the state, California capacity margins will fall well below North 
American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) reliability criteria (roughly 15 
percent) this summer. The West is the only region in North America that will 
experience a tightening of capacity margins relative to levels in 1999 under 
normal weather conditions. CERA anticipates peak demand growth to continue to 
outpace new capacity additions through 2001, with slightly growing capacity 
margins in 2002. At these levels, an unusual amount of either plant capacity 
or transmission line capacity out of service during peak demand conditions 
would require the ISO to mandate blackouts of a portion of the state's load 
to maintain the overall stability of the grid.

Thus, the tight capacity situation in the state will continue to pressure 
prices to high levels, which may provoke legislators and regulators to 
attempt to extend the price caps or implement additional market rules.

Market Distorting Effects
Under tremendous pressure from some legislators, regulators, and market 
participants, the California ISO Board of Governors lowered the current price 
caps on energy from $750 to $500 per MWh in a special meeting conducted June 
28.** Owing to the interconnectedness of western markets, the decision to 
lower the caps and the apparent willingness of regulators to continue to 
change the rules governing California's electricity markets will affect power 
market participants throughout the West.

* Profitability of existing and future generators degraded. High power prices 
and volatility levels in June, although detrimental to most buyers, provide 
strong encouragement to plant developers. Limiting the level of price fly-ups 
degrades the ability of plant owners to recover capital costs plus earn a 
return on that capital. In most periods of the year, competition drives 
prices to levels that provide little opportunity for a return on capital. 
Generators therefore seek to recover their investments with higher bids in 
California's energy and ancillary services markets during periods of supply 
scarcity. Existing merchant generators are at increased risk to recover the 
investments they made based on cash flow outlooks developed prior to the 
imposition of caps.

* Supply shortfall prolonged. The process of siting and permitting power 
plants in California is cumbersome, requiring as long as five years from 
plant proposal to synchronization with the grid. The California Energy 
Commission (CEC), the state agency charged with approving new plants, has 
repeatedly expressed concerns about the chronic tight supply situation in the 
state. Price-dampening market intervention indicates to plant developers that 
California officials may continue to reengineer the state's power markets to 
the detriment of generator profitability and, when added to the difficult 
permitting process, potentially delaying the introduction of new capacity to 
meet rapidly growing state demand. Prominent plant developers have recently 
indicated that markets outside of California may provide a more stable market 
and a better environment for deploying scarce resources and generating 
equipment such as turbines.

* Trading positions affected. Lowering price caps reduces the degree of price 
volatility and the level of overall average prices. Market participants have 
executed market positions based on the outlook for prices under the previous, 
higher price cap. By lowering the price cap, not only are the value of 
existing physical (e.g., power plant) and financial (e.g., forward contracts) 
positions significantly affected, but market participants must also 
incorporate the uncertainty of possible future adjustments to the cap into 
their trading.*

* Circumventing market rules. The variety of energy and capacity markets in 
California, as well as the bilateral markets outside of the state, provides 
opportunities to circumvent the intent of the new market rules, further 
distorting the markets in the West.

Although lowering price caps in California will likely temporarily reduce 
price levels, the new power plant capacity ultimately needed in the state to 
reduce price levels and improve reliability on a sustainable basis could be 
discouraged by prolonged and repeated intervention in the market.

Guys - Weather permitting in the Texas Panhandle area, I expect to be in 
Friona, TX on Monday, November 20th, on business.  Provided below are some  
items I would have mentioned in the Monday staff meeting:

Plains Farmer's Coop - To date, I have been able to collect approximately 
half of the $500,000 imbalance which Plains Coop owes TW.  I will be meeting 
Charles Hough in Friona (Friona is located 100 miles west of Amarillo) on 
Monday to discuss the payment plan for the remaining imbalance amount in 
additionaI to other general business matters.  I discussed my action plan 
with legal and credit and will request full payment by January 31, 2000, 
latest date.  Effective Febrary 1st,  TW will also include penalty payments 
with any future imbalance outside the +/- 10% tolerance level.  

Pogo Producing - I met recently with John Havard with Pogo. Pogo plans to 
spud a well in Eddy county which is an offset to the EOG operated well 
recently completed and in the process of being attached to TW.   Pogo's well 
will be spud in December with an expected 60 day drill & completion time.  
They have an optimistic expectation of the production being close to the EOG 
well - current initial production of 14 MMcf/d, and have plans for additional 
drilling in the field area.  

CIG - A conference call was held with CIG on Friday to discuss delivery 
performance issues of deliveries to the CIG/Tumbleweed point and the ability 
of them to increase their delivery capacity to Transwestern.    They 
explained that CIG is currently fully subscribed and operating at MAOP along 
the line which provides deliveries to Transwestern, El Paso, NNG and 
SPS/Nichols.  All shippers holding capacity along this line (capacity 200 
MMcf/d)  already have subscribed to long term contracts primarily to El Paso 
and SPS.   Currently they have no operational capability to provide any more 
incremental delivery capabilities to TW at Tumbleweed.  However, they have 
indicated a probable second Raton Expansion project will be announced March 
2001 and have suggested that looping of this southern line could be a 
possible outcome of the project which would provide incremental delivery 
capacity to Transwestern above the current 40 MMcf/d level.  I will be having 
additional discussions with CIG marketing individuals to determine who, 
besides  El Paso and Evergreen, are the primary existing shippers down the 
southern portion of CIG's system in order to potentially get them to realign 
their contract to Transwestern as a primary delivery point.   

Expedition of Contracting Process - Per Kevin's request, I provided him, and 
also discussed, several ideas which would streamline and improve the existing 
contract processing cycle.  The most important and critical recommendation 
was to revise the 3 year old ET&S Discounting Policy which Bill Cordes had 
established for both TW and Northern.  Obtaining approval of even a few 
simple changes I could recommend to the Policy (applicable only to 
Transwestern, not NNG) would have an immediate effect of simplying the 
Officer approval process and would expedite the turn-around time.

Title: The Storm Arrives
Author: N. American Gas Team
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: North American Gas ,

URL: http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/120800_16/nag_alt_120800_16_ab.html
*********************************************************

Cold Weather Path
Colder-than-normal weather through November and
forecasted cold for the first half of December
throughout the Midwest and Northeast have driven gas
prices well into record territory, with the January
Henry Hub price trading near $9.00 per MMBtu and closing
above $8.00 on the New York Mercantile Exchange December
6. This six-week cold period and the quick depletion of
already low storage inventories has established prices
at or above CERA's cold weather path for the remainder
of the winter and in all likelihood beyond. If December
storage withdrawals are as high as CERA now expects, the
gas market will remain on the cold weather path through
2001 as well, even if weather returns to normal during
the second half of December. The enormous increase in
storage injections that is likely to be required next
summer would keep the pressure on gas markets throughout
the year.

So long as weather remains cold (or even normal) this
winter, a new market dynamic is in effect in which gas
prices interact more with distillate fuel oil prices
rather than with those of residual fuel oil. In
addition, gas is likely to have an increasingly direct
influence on power prices in the growing number of
regions in which gas-fired generation is now on the
margin in winter. This winter, the gas market is likely
to rediscover for the first time in decades which end
users value natural gas most highly, and which
ultimately do not.

The gas market is also rediscovering the value of firm
pipeline capacity, particularly into market areas. Both
the West Coast and the Northeast have experienced even
more extreme price spikes, with daily prices in both
regions peaking above $20.00 per MMBtu. Indeed, the
shortage of gas in California is so acute that prices
above $40.00 per MMBtu have been reported. If sustained,
these price levels will induce a political reaction that
will reverberate throughout the industry.

Storage Update-Even High Seems Low
Panic in the market yesterday was eased somewhat as
storage withdrawals for the week ending December 1, at
73 billion cubic feet (Bcf), proved to be less than
expected. This withdrawal was half the previous week's
rate, and in CERA's view actual withdrawals for both
weeks probably lie between these two readings. (In some
cases successive weeks smooth out volatile readings in
the AGA survey.) But even the 73 Bcf figure, though a
significant retreat from the previous week's rate, is
high by historical standards. One would have to go back
to 1994 to find a higher reading for a comparable week
in the AGA survey.

Inventories as of the beginning of December, at an
estimated 2,466 Bcf (see Table 1), were 525 Bcf below
the year-earlier level, and this deficit is likely to
increase substantially during December. If weather
forecasts indicating colder-than-normal weather through
mid-December in key heating markets hold true, storage
withdrawals for the month will average approximately
20.0 Bcf per day. This rate is an increase from CERA's
normal weather estimate of 17.0 Bcf per day, and even
this rate depends on weather returning to normal in mid-
December. This level of withdrawals would leave only
1,846 Bcf in storage on January 1, an inventory 663 Bcf
below the year-earlier level. Assuming normal weather,
such an inventory would place storage on track to reach
a March minimum of 488 Bcf, 270 Bcf below the 1996
record low. At a US inventory level this low, many
storage operators would be dipping into base-load gas in
order to support service even to firm gas customers.

* Physical deliverability from storage fields will be
significantly lower this year in midwinter, forcing a
greater reliance on pipeline gas and peaking facilities
during January and February. The actual reduction in
field deliverability is impossible to quantify, but
storage inventories cannot be withdrawn at steady rates
throughout the winter; withdrawal rates decline with
inventory as field pressure is reduced.

*  Pressure in the market will be reinforced and
extended through 2001 and probably into 2002. During the
past two summers, high prices have been required to
discourage demand and allow overall US storage
injections to reach barely 1.6 trillion cubic feet
(Tcf). If normal weather holds for the remainder of this
winter, 2.2 Tcf of injections-which would be nearly
impossible to achieve-would be required during 2001 if
inventories are to recover to 2.7 Tcf at peak. If
weather this winter is merely normal from mid-December
through March, going into winter next year the United
States will have considerably less gas in storage.
Reaching even the 2,362 Bcf level, according to CERA
estimates (see Table 1), would require an additional 275
Bcf of injections next year, and that alone would prove
challenging.

Price-The Cold Weather Path
The weakness of storage inventories and the demand
pressure in both core and power generation markets
created by the cold weather have caused prices to move
onto and even above CERA's cold weather path for this
winter (see Table 2). Storage inventories would become
perilously low if the current forecast for cold weather
through mid-December proves accurate, and the injections
required next summer would keep pressure in the market
intense. For these reasons CERA's outlook for prices for
January and throughout 2001 now reflects the cold
weather path.  Prices could take an even higher path,
particularly if colder-than-normal weather endures
beyond mid-December or returns on a sustained basis in
January or February.

Several forces that could weaken prices during 2001 will
begin to enter the market during the winter, but these
are offset by demand volatility in the winter and the
requirement to rebuild storage inventories once the
winter is over. Such factors include a building US
supply capability, growing imports, softening oil prices
(allowing a lower floor for prices once the winter
ends), and potentially weakening economic growth.

Although the influence of these factors will increase,
it is unlikely to match the huge injection requirement
that appears more and more certain next summer.

Demand-The Difficult Next Round of Switching
With gas prices hitting new record highs, CERA expects
some additional demand to be priced out of the market.
Because gas has priced above residual fuel oil for most
weeks since May, however, the easiest fuel switching in
the power generation and industrial sectors has already
occurred. Even though gas prices are currently above the
level of distillate (approximately $7.23 per MMBtu in
New York), switching from gas to distillate requires
changes in long-standing consumer habit, will occur only
over time, and is likely limited in volume. Significant
switching to distillate would quickly raise the price of
distillate itself.

There are four major sources of additional demand
response in industrial markets:

* Additional switching to resid in industrial boilers.
The next increment of demand to come out of the market
is likely to be in the industrial sector, through
additional fuel switching to resid (and to some extent
to distillate). These markets will continue to show some
flexibility but will not represent a large volume. CERA
estimates that the industrial boiler market has probably
already begun to lose small amounts (less than 0.5 Bcf
per day) in switching to resid, given the consistency of
gas price premiums greater than $0.50 per MMBtu.

* Investment in restoring switching capability. As
premiums move far beyond this level, industrial end
users can be expected to take a closer look at
reinvigorating their switching capability beyond their
initial short-term levels. However, such a change would
require investment by industrial end users and the
availability of resid in oil markets. CERA estimates
that with focused investment over the course of a number
of months to perhaps a year, switching to resid could
eventually reach as high as 1.3 Bcf per day. There is
already some movement here; given the impact of high gas
prices on earnings, energy prices have already begun to
receive management attention.

* Switching to distillate. US Department of Energy data
suggest that industrial end users have a theoretical
capability of switching nearly 1.3 Bcf per day to
distillate in the short term. This switch would
represent additional distillate demand of over 200,000
barrels per day (bd) in a US market of 3.8 million
barrels. This marginal demand would move the distillate
price in tandem with gas price, and any additional
switching among power generators to distillate would
reinforce this price correlation. In addition, the
availability of distillate inventories on site should
restrict the quick switching to short periods of time
and will not offer a long-term solution to tight
markets.

* Shutting down industrial plants. Also offering some
flexibility is the shutdown of manufacturing plants that
use gas as a feedstock. The major feedstock consumers
are the ammonia and methanol industries, and, not
surprisingly given the tight margins available,
manufacturers of ammonia and of methanol continue to
show suppressed gas demand. However, in the short term
only a portion of ammonia production is at risk. Whereas
the production needs of merchant facilities along the
Gulf Coast is relatively readily replaced by imports,
substitution becomes more difficult away from the coast
(because of transportation logistics) and for facilities
whose production is linked to value-added fertilizer
products. Hence, CERA still estimates that even with
nonexistent margins, substantial ammonia production
would continue, with additional losses of perhaps 200
million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of potential demand in
addition to the facilities that have already closed.
Extraordinarily high gas prices will also hasten the
shuttering of North American methanol capacity, putting
at risk another 100 to 200 MMcf per day of gas demand
for that sector.

Switching that could occur in boiler use is concentrated
in the chemicals, paper, and refining sectors in the
South and the food products sector in the Midwest.
Continuing feedstock losses would be concentrated in the
South Central region. For process users, even
extraordinarily high gas prices are expected to have
little impact on the use of gas in the short term.
Energy costs are not the dominant component of
production costs for these users, and a physical
changeover would be time-intensive and elemental in its
impact on end-use product quality.

The Northeast-Cold Weather Operations Begin
All of the Northeast pipelines have issued notices to
customers that they either have imposed, or are highly
likely to need to impose, transportation restrictions of
various types. The most common restriction is to
nonprimary firm services (secondary and interruptible
type services), which will be scheduled for the next
several days on many pipelines. Other pipelines have
issued balancing requirements whereby receipts and
deliveries must match. Even hourly flow orders have also
been implemented.

These actions are normal for winter operations when a
cold period is expected. Whereas the firm market for
natural gas is rarely affected by these restrictions,
the spot market becomes much more volatile as
interruptible supplies dry up. The spot market,
primarily made up of nonfirm customers, has had a
dramatic reaction to the diminished availability of
delivered spot gas into the market area, as has been
reflected by the volatility of the cash market this
week. The result of these restrictions of nonprimary
firm services has been an expansion of basis to Henry
Hub. At one point, gas for next-day delivery to New York
traded near $24.00 per MMBtu delivered, although the
average price was closer to $14.20. These high spikes
are the result of very thinly traded volumes of gas.

Although these restrictions will likely ease as
temperatures return closer to normal, CERA now expects
basis into the New York citygate to average $1.31 per
MMBtu for December and $1.36 per MMBtu for January.

Title: Midmonth Report: Early Warning
Author: N. American Gas Team
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: North American Gas ,
URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1420 ,

*********************************************************

After a warm October, the first cold weather this year
has provided an early warning of what winter could bring
for the gas market. Cold weather across much of the
great plains and a cold forecast for larger heating
markets in the Midwest and Northeast have driven a surge
in gas prices of more than $1.00 per million British
thermal units (MMBtu) over the past week. This rebound
in price highlighted the continued tightness of supply
and moved the price of gas back above that of residual
fuel oil, assuring that dual-fuel loads remain off of
gas. Supplies for the winter are not adequate to allow
most dual-fuel end users to burn gas. If this cold snap
extends through the remainder of November, a heavy
early-winter draw on storage could set the stage for
unprecedented high prices through the winter.

Though storage inventories have reached near the 2,750
billion cubic feet (Bcf) level, they remain at a record
low heading into the heating season, and even a normal
winter would reduce inventories to a near record or
record absolute low by spring. This supply tightness
places the gas price playing field in the broad
territory above the resid price (near $5.00 in the Gulf
Coast) and into a range potentially testing the next,
difficult level of demand resistance. This resistance
could come from switching to distillate oil, but low
distillate inventories and high distillate prices mean
that switching would require a gas price above $7.50 per
MMBtu, and any move to switch to distillate would likely
drive prices of both commodities higher. Rather, a
combination of some switching to resid in industrial
boilers and a shutdown of a few more price-sensitive end
users may be required. None of these measures comes
easily or cheaply, however, and they can be overwhelmed
by weather-driven swings in demand. As a result, as cold
weather settles in, CERA expects heightened price
volatility at levels above the price of resid and
extreme sensitivity in the market to weather and weather
forecasts. Under normal weather conditions, CERA expects
Henry Hub prices to average $5.70 during December (see
Table 1), which by itself would represent an all time
high for December. But even this estimate could prove
low. If the current cold snap extends through early
December, prices could easily climb into the $6.50-$7.00
per MMBtu range.

Gas Storage-The Record Low Maximum
CERA estimates that storage inventories reached a
maximum of 2,746 Bcf as of the end of October, a record
low for that month by 64 Bcf (see Table 2). Even this
level was reached only through a fortunate combination
of a lack of storms in the Gulf of Mexico and consistent
warmth through most of October. The withdrawal season is
likely to have begun this week, however, and in a strong
way. The cold weather now settling in is likely to
offset warmth early this month, increasing the
withdrawal rate this November to 3.5 Bcf per day on
average, well above the 1.0 Bcf per day average rate of
the past two years. By the end of this month, the US
inventory deficit is likely to have widened again, to
350 Bcf.

CERA estimates that normal December weather would
require storage withdrawals of approximately 17.0 Bcf
per day, which is above last year's rate of 16.6 Bcf per
day. This year, however, this withdrawal rate would
apply consistent pressure in the market through December
and beyond, as it would keep inventories on a path to
reach 756 Bcf by the end of March, just below the 1996
all-time end-of-March low of 758 Bcf. So long as
inventories remain on this path the pressure does not
end even with the end of winter, as a significant
increase in injections next year would be required for
inventories to reach even 2.6 trillion cubic feet (Tcf)
by next fall. Although the supply build will begin to
help by late winter, it is unlikely to be of the
magnitude required both to offset power generation
demand growth and to allow this increase in storage
injections to occur-unless demand continues to be priced
out of the market.

Demand-Keeping Warm
After last year's warm winter, CERA expects a strong
rebound in heating demand, and this week's weather and
forecast reinforce that expectation. Weather last winter
(November through March) was the warmest of the decade,
and there will be a significant rebound in heating
demand in the residential and commercial sectors as
weather returns toward normal this heating season.

Under normal weather conditions,
* Average heating demand through the winter would be 3.5
Bcf per day higher than last year's.

* Monthly average heating demand through the winter
would be 36.7 Bcf per day, peaking at 45.6 Bcf per day
in January.

* December heating demand would increase by 4.8 Bcf per
day relative to last December.

Weather 5 percent colder than normal could further
increase December demand by 1.8 Bcf per day relative to
normal weather; likewise, a 5 percent warmer-than-normal
scenario could decrease demand by 1.7 Bcf per day
relative to normal weather.

Fuel Switching
With natural gas markets this tight, there is
significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the
market. Residential and commercial demand is inelastic
to price in the short run, which leaves industrial
demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the
market. This winter we expect

* all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an
alternative to gas to do so

* a loss of 700 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of
demand for power generation relative to last winter

* industrial consumers to switch the equivalent of 500
MMcf per day off of gas

* gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil
prices, as much as resid will act as a floor for gas

For December CERA expects an overall demand increase of
4.5 Bcf per day relative to last December and a 14.4 Bcf
per day increase in demand relative to November, with
increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel
switching.

Supply-The Rebound
The pressure from increasing demand and lower storage
inventories is intense, but US supply is beginning to
rebound. The recent steep decline in US lower-48
capacity is expected to reverse in late 2000, given the
soaring gas-related rig count.

* The success in reversing the decline in the Gulf of
Mexico is related to the combination of

- the ramp-up of the Hickory and Tanzanite subsalt
discoveries on the shelf, adding to the recent startup
of the Muni field; these fields could add over 0.5 Bcf
per day later in 2001

- the response of the shallow water to the strong
late 1999 turnaround in drilling activity

* Other important capacity additions are occurring in
the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, with 0.5 Bcf per day in
2000 and 2001, and onshore, led by the Bossier sand play
in Freestone County, Texas, the Barnett Shale play in
Wise County, Texas, and the Powder River Basin coal seam
play.

* Further increases in drilling are likely to slow. New
deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs
are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older
rigs. Producers are experiencing delays in obtaining
rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling
companies struggle to round out drilling crews.

Regional Markets-Wild Winter in the West
Extremely cold weather in the West has brought Rockies
prices close to parity with Henry Hub prices and
triggered early season spikes at Sumas in the north and
Topock in the south. Pipeline maintenance on El Paso is
exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has
contributed to Topock differentials of over $2.00 per
MMBtu. Tight pricing relationships to the Henry Hub in
the San Juan and Rocky Mountains should hold through
February, with significant widening in differentials as
heating loads decline.

Winter has arrived in earnest across North America, but
the start-up of firm transportation service on Alliance
is delayed once again, this time until December 1.
Nonetheless, flows on the pipeline are under way; CERA
estimates that flows during October averaged 450 MMcf
per day. During November that total should climb to 750
MMcf per day, despite the later published start date.
With or without Alliance flows, a weather-driven rebound
in midwestern demand relative to November and December
last year should keep prices in Chicago at a significant
premium to Henry Hub prices. In the Northeast,
differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to
spikes throughout the winter, despite greater flows into
the region from Atlantic Canada this year (see Table 3).

CERA's outlook by region follows:
* Rockies. Very cold weather within the region has
brought Rocky Mountain prices near parity with Henry Hub
prices. A break in the cold or a cold snap in the East
will likely widen the differentials, but strong heating
demand in the region will keep differentials within
about $0.25 per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price. CERA
expects a December average differential of $0.25 per
MMBtu; however, this differential is expected to show
significant volatility based on regional weather. A warm
week in the Rockies could still push differentials
toward $0.50 per MMBtu.

* San Juan. San Juan prices will continue to hold close
to Rockies prices through the winter, with significant
pipeline capacity between the two regions. Heating loads
in the Rockies will determine the San Juan to Henry Hub
differential, with extended cold weather in the Rockies
pulling both prices close to the Henry Hub price. CERA
expects the December differential in the San Juan Basin
to average $0.20 per MMBtu.
* Permian and Mid-Continent. Unlike prices within the
rest of the West, differentials between the Henry Hub
and the Mid-Continent and Permian Basins are likely to
trade within a relatively narrow range during the
winter, as supplies from those basins are pulled either
east or west, depending on regional weather. CERA
expects a Permian to Henry Hub differential of $0.11 per
MMBtu and a Mid-Continent differential of $0.08 per
MMBtu for December.
* Chicago. Alliance flows into the Chicago market are
now running close to 750 MMcf per day. However, the
onset of the heating season has offset those increased
flows and pushed Chicago differentials up to near $0.15
per MMBtu relative to the Henry Hub, despite delays in
the completion of the Vector pipeline. CERA expects the
strong pricing at Chicago to continue, and December
differentials should average $0.25 per MMBtu.

* Northeast markets. Assuming normal weather, we expect
to see December basis for New York relative to Henry Hub
at $1.03 per MMBtu. New England will likely see prices
$0.05-$0.15 higher, depending on the pipeline. Much of
this increased basis differential is caused by fuel
costs. For example, with a 9 percent retention rate from
the Gulf Coast into New England, last December would
have seen retention costs of approximately $0.22; at
$5.70, that same retention equates to $0.50. Despite
additional volumes of gas deliverable into the Northeast
from the Atlantic Canadian fields, there have been no
additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this
gas to the local markets, and an additional 166,000
MMBtu per day of potential demand will compete for the
capacity. Because of this tightness, should this month's
weather be colder than normal, we could see severe
spikes in basis similar to those seen in January 2000.
These spikes could even exceed the highs seen in
January, depending on the severity of any cold snaps and
the extent to which new electric loads are realized.

Canadian Markets-Winter Begins
The colder-than-normal weather has increased demand in
western Canada but is only now being felt in the East.
Storage peaked in the West in early October at
approximately 225 Bcf below last year's level and 6 Bcf
below the five-year average. Even with modest
withdrawals since that time, storage inventories are
still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs.
Easter Canadian storage has continued to grow, pushing
levels to over 245 Bcf, 11 Bcf above last year and well
above the five-year average. With the eastward movement
of the colder weather, withdrawals are likely to begin.
This higher level of eastern storage will be useful with
the expected reduction of flows on TransCanada.

The good news resulting from the cold is a more normal
"freeze-up," which bodes well for a longer winter
drilling season. Gas well completions are expected to
reach 8,500 for 2000 and will likely be even higher next
year.

Further Delays for Alliance?
The "commercial" in-service date for Alliance has been
delayed until December 1, the result of a combination of
problems with clearing the line, delays in the
completion of the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant,
the delay of Vector, and a lack of supply. The pipeline
has been flowing gas, however, with volumes building up
since September. It is estimated that flows for November
will average 750 MMcf per day. TransCanada has taken the
full brunt of the Alliance flows so far, with Northern
Border and PGT remaining strong. December should see
Alliance flows build to between 900 and 1,000 MMcf per
day, with modest reductions in flows on Northern Border
and PGT. Storage withdrawals will likely keep
TransCanada reductions close to 350 MMcf per day, year-
over-year, until Vector begins service to eastern
Canada.

High Prices: Strong Pull West
The high demand in the Pacific Northwest has also
provided strength for AECO. The AECO-Henry differential
has dropped to the high $0.30s and low $0.40s as a
result of this increased pull. For December, the
differential is expected to average $0.50 per MMBtu, for
a resulting AECO average of C$6.97 per gigajoule
(US$5.10 per MMBtu).

Enron OnLine Capacity Auction
Bidding opened on Thursday 6/22; no bids have been received as yet but 
several shippers have indicated interest and plan on responding on Monday 
6/26.  Bids close at 2pm Monday 6/26.  Coincidentally, we received a call 
from Unbound Technology, a developer of wireless software technology.  
UnBound provides software architecture  that creates the connection between 
transaction processes and wireless services.  This potentially would allow TW 
to extend our e-commerce services beyond the desktop  to a wireless user 
through a customized, wireless interface (pagers, cell phones, etc.).  We 
have set a meeting with Unbound for next Wednesday.

Fuel Monetization
Implementation cost estimates are being finalized as customer interest is 
being evaluated for this potential service option.  Duke, Southern, and 
Reliant are all interested but only if they can have first call on the space 
created.  El Paso Merchant Energy is expected to provide Transwestern a 
proposal, early next week, for the potential monetization of the fuel 
component for their company's transportation contracts totaling 65,000 Dth/d 
of San Juan to California capacity.

Southern Company Energy Marketing
John Hogan was in town this week.  Southern has advanced to the second round 
of bidding on Nevada Power's generation assets which are scheduled to be sold 
off by the end of this year.  SCEM's Gallup agreement allows them to deliver 
to the new SWG delivery point on an alternate basis, but if Southern is 
successful in obtaining any of Nevada Power's gen assets, they may request to 
amend the delivery point on their Gallup contract.  SCEM is also very 
interested in any expansions TW may have in the near future.  Due to their 
affiliation with Vastar, they have a definite appetite for more San Juan to 
CA or NV transport.

Southern is interested in the possibility of buying options for capacity on 
TW and we requested that he get his regulatory group familiar with the idea 
in hopes that SCEM would support of our filing.

SCEM also plans to trigger its ROFR on their Ignacio to Blanco capacity 
(30,000/d) by the 7/1 deadline.

Duke
They have triggered their ROFR on the Ignacio to Blanco capacity (18,000/d) 
and this capacity will be posted on the Internet per TW's tariff the week of 
7/3.

Pueblo Project
Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson was excoriated this week in front of 
Senate panels reviewing his and the DOE's conduct regarding the missing 
computer hard drives at Los Alamos.  Since the Pueblo project hinged on the 
ability of Richardson to use his Secretarial discretion to create this sole 
source contract, with limited review by Congress, we can rest assured 
Congressional support for Richardson or any of his pet projects is 
non-existent.

Miscellaneous
Received a call from an irate Houston citizen complaining of "aggressive" 
driving by an 18-wheel motor fuel carrier with "Transwestern" painted on the 
truck.  We assured the caller it was not our truck and recommended he call 
the Tx DOT or sherriff's department.

Imagine, if you can, a world in which information is disseminated as rapidly 
as it is received.  A world in which news reaches you before you even have a 
chance to wonder about it, much less speculate with your colleagues at the 
water cooler.  

A world in which the barriers to timely communication of important facts are 
erased like last month's unfiled emails.

Sounds too good to be true in "Corporate America", doesn't it?  Well, hold on 
to your hats; there's a new online publication in town.  

The dot is coming.

Hi Little Mell!!

Vegas is nice.  It has visibly changed since we were last here.  Lots of new
Hotel/Casinos.  The concert was very good.  We came in very late due to
travel delays and missed the first 3/4 of Lenny Kravitz and all of Cheryl
Crow.  My Lagerfeld satchel didn't survive it's gate check ordeal (all the
contents were fine though) so I now have a reasonably nice new bag a'la
Southwest Airlines baggage office.  I'll give you details later.

Last night after the concert, we grabbed a couple of hot dogs and wandered
through some casinos.  While waiting for Steve to go to an ATM I killed some
time by putting a $20 into a nickel slot machine and won 7500 nickels
($375).  Later, while waiting for Steve to use the facilities, I won $40 on
a quarter slots machine.  So far, so good.

Give me a call.  The number here is 702-414-1000.  Ask for Danny Yee's room.

I love you,
Jim

Interactive Open Season - TW held its third IOS of the year this week for 
14,000 MMBtu/d of space from East of Thoreau to PG&E Topock.  Ten parties 
originally registered to bid of which 7 actually participated.  The high bid 
was Reliant at $.138.

Gallup Compressor - A meeting was held with Operations, Regulatory, and 
Facility Planning personnel to review the performance of the new compressor 
station.  Currently, the vibration level has increased.  The unit and lateral 
efficiency are a continuing concern.  Operations plans to pull the unit apart 
in early September for an evaluation.  At this time, the anticipated 30,000 
MMBtu/d of "additional" capacity we hoped to have is now not available.  
There is also concern that we may be unable to meet our currently subscribed 
FT obligation.

El Paso All American - We attended the El Paso Pipeline meeting this week as 
they described their FERC filing to begin the conversion of the All American 
Pipeline from oil to gas.  They reiterated several times to attending 
shippers that the project would not offer any incremental space to the main 
line.  El Paso's filing centers around the cost and fuel savings from 
decommissioning very old compressor equipment on their south system and 
replacing the capacity with the All American line.  The cost figures 
(conversion and acquisition) that El Paso filed tracked very closely with 
what Transwestern estimated in its evaluation of the pipe.  The in-service 
date is expected to be July 1, 2001.

Transport Options - TW Commercial reps met with marketing and regulatory 
personnel from Burlington Resources, Conoco, and Texaco this week to review 
the proposed Transport Options Tariff filing.  The meeting was very positive 
and constructive.  Several suggestions were made that led to the realization 
that the best course of action would be to delay the actual tariff filing and 
have a working group meeting in the Houston office.  Everyone agreed that as 
much preliminary work as possible should be done before the filing to make 
the whole process less contentious and to garner more customer support for 
the tariff.  We are trying to schedule the working group session for the 
third week of August.

Crawford Lateral - A line leak on the lateral this week reduced flow from 
50,000 MMBtu/d to zero.  Operations initially estimated 2-3 days of down time 
but actually only required 12 hours.  Approximately 55 feet of line was 
replaced.

El Paso Measurement Letter - Stan Horton forwarded the "mis-measurement" 
letter to El Paso management this week.  We will follow up in approximately 
two weeks if they don't respond sooner.

Operator Imbalances - Met with Market Services personnel to review operator 
imbalances across TW's system.  Marketing is supportive of Gas Control's 
efforts to limit the imbalances and begin allocations if operators schedule 
gas and then can't deliver.  With proactive balance management, there is 
opportunity to realize greater Park 'N Ride revenue.

TransColorado Shipper Meeting - Kevin Hyatt will be attending the 
TransColorado shipper meeting this week in Boulder.  Christine Stokes 
attended the Colorado Oil & Gas Association meeting.

On Monday, September 11, Jean McFarland will meet with our team to briefly 
give an overview of the upcoming installation of Windows 2000.    We will try 
to devote the last 15 minutes of staff meeting time to Jean.   Unlike the 
conference room on the 42nd floor, we will have to be out of EB-4102 by 
10:45am for Julia's Staff Meeting.    This will mean giving abbreviated 
reports. 

Please place this date and time on your calendars.

Thanks in advance,

Fuel Hedging - We hedged another 5,000 MMBtu/d of fuel for 2001 at $3.63.  
This brings our fuel hedge thus far to 15,000 MMBtu/d at an average price of 
$3.53 (basis adjusted).  We are evaluating doing another 5000/d and/or 
selling out-of the-money calls and collecting the premiums.

Interactive Open Season - TW has posted an announcement for an Interactive 
Open Season to be held August 10, 2000 for 14,000 MMBtu/d of East of Thoreau 
to PG&E/Topock capacity for the term of April 1, 2001 - October 31, 2001.  
With Topock values currently depressed relative to Needles, we'll attempt to 
add some value to the IOS by giving shippers alternative delivery capability 
at Needles and the new power plant at Citizens/Griffith.

Southwest Gas - has finally begun construction on the new interconnect 
between SWG and TW!!!  Per our Interconnect & Operating Agreement we must pay 
the remaining half of the CIAC, which is estimated to be $442,500, "...no 
later than 10 days following the date on which SWG notifies TW that the new 
interconnect will be in-service within 3 months."  SWG has not met this 
criteria yet.

Burlington - Burlington has requested TW respond to an apparent discrepancy 
in the physical volumes we can (or cannot) take from them at the Val Verde 
Plant versus the currently effective operating agreement.  The problem is 
current high temperatures in the San Juan region have limited our take-away 
capabilities and the summer / winter seasonality was not taken into account 
when we drafted the last amendment in January of this year.  We will meet 
with Legal, Facility Planning and Gas Control to craft a response for Richard 
Riehm.

Amoco - We have scheduled a conference call with Legal and Commercial Reps 
from Amoco for next Tuesday afternoon to discuss the Transport Options 
Program.

Red Cedar - Negotiations continue on the FT deal.  Red Cedar has requested an 
option to call on 35,000 MMBtu of capacity in year 2 of the 5 year 
agreement.   Working with Enron Risk Management, we determined the value of 
this option to be approximately $200,000 which may be rolled into the 
contract.

El Paso Field Services - In our efforts to move ahead on the new 
interconnect, we have responded to EPFS that TW would commit $100,000 towards 
the new interconnect as well as require a volume commitment from EPFS of 
20,000 MMBtu/d for up to 2 years.  EPFS is taking TW's offer to management 
for review.

El Paso Natural Gas - The letter to EP for Stan Horton's signature relative 
to our Blanco measurement dispute is going through its final iterations and 
should be ready to send by Friday 8/4.

Thanks again for your help on getting the well connected ASAP.  For the
weekend, we estimate we will be flowing around 34,000 mmbtu/day.
We have been replacing wellhead equipment and dehy's to allow for greater
production.
Hopefully this flow will continue for awhile.
We are selling the production at the interconnect, hopefully TW is getting
a good transport rate.  Earlier today, i could have paid TW $4.00/mmbtu
transport, got any FT?  $10.50 at the border, $5.50 at TW. Makes your FT
west shippers rich.

I know we have had numerous discussions with gas control, Michelle, field
people, etc.  Tell everyone thanks for the hard work.

The initial phase of construction on I-45  is scheduled to begin Sunday, 
October 1, all southbound lanes will be closed Sunday night at 7:00 p.m., 
with a detour at I-10 eastbound to US 59 southbound.  Two southbound lanes 
will be reopened  on I-45 beginning October 2 at 5:00 a.m. 

 The southbound exit ramp to Pierce/Dallas will be closed during the initial 
phase of this work.  
The southbound exit ramp to McKinney will be open.
 Anyone  typically using these routes must find an alternate route.

The McKinney and Pierce/Dallas exits will alternately be open during 
subsequent phases of the roadwork.  The southbound main lanes will reopen 
January 18, 2001. 

 Additionally, the entrance ramp from Allen Parkway eastbound will be closed 
for reconstruction of the south and northbound bridge.

The Downtown District is updating its web site with detailed road closure 
maps and suggested alternate routes.  This information is available at: 
www.downtownstreets.com/I-45/i-45.html,  bookmark for further reference.  
This site will be updated as road construction projects progress.

I have had a casual chat with some of my accounts regarding their opinion of 
the market dynamics affecting the Needles to Topock price differentials.  
Each customer focused more on the supply side dynamics of Topock gas 
supplies, rather than the incremental intra-state transport costs required to 
transport to the PG&E citygate, as the primary driving force for the Needles 
to Topock  price differential.    

Here is a recurring theme I heard from my customers:  The El Paso Merchant 
Service (EPMS) 1.2 BCF contract's Block II capacity (500 MMcf/d of Permian to 
PG&E/Topock capacity,  $.065 transport rate) has a re-callable aspect.  If 
EPMS schedules gas under the transport of Block II capacity to any other 
California delivery point other than PG&E/Topock, then other parties may 
recall the capacity for their own use to PG&E/Topock.  Currently Duke has 
recalled 100 MMcf/d and PG&E Energy Trading has also recalled 100 MMcf/d for 
their use to transport Permian gas to PG&E/Topock. (FYI - EPMC may re-recall 
this capacity, but they have elected not to).  These additional Topock 
supplies coming from Duke and PG&E Energy Trading under Block II capacity may 
be viewed as providing an oversupply of gas to PG&E at Topock.  This gas 
competes head to head with Malin gas prices.  For example, today's Malin 
price is $4.62 while PG&E/Topock price is $4.69.    Today's cash price 
differential between Needles and Topock is $.60, far larger than the 
previously assumed $.28 differential resulting from the intrastate cost 
required to bring Topock gas to the citygate.    

If anyone else had additional market information or opinions regarding these 
market dynamics, let's discuss further at our next staff meeting. CS

Once again, it's time to find out what you think about your work experience=

at Enron and Enron Transportation Services Company, and what we can do to=
=20
help make it better.  That's why we want to check your pulse.  In fact, we'=

=20
survey to The Pulse.  We believe The Pulse more accurately captures the=20

we can continue to make Enron a great place to work.

Is available:  Monday, Oct. 16 - Friday, Oct. 27
Is located at: survey.enron.com

There are a few things we want you to remember about The Pulse:

1. Your survey responses will be confidential.  You can complete your surve=

you can key in your responses from your desktop computer. The responses key=

=20
ones.  We may ask for your help in resolving some of the issues that are=20
collected in the survey - your active role will help us identify the best=
=20
solutions.
In last year's survey, you identified several problem areas regarding=20
internal communications, workload and performance management. We've already=

acted on many of your recommendations.  These are a few of the things we've=
=20
accomplished in direct response to your input:

through the initiation of:
=01  Table Talk sessions with ETS Office of the Chairman, which give employ=
ees=20
the opportunity to have frontline discussions,
=01  The "Innovation Series," which invites employees to share their ideas=

NGPL Recontracts with NIPSCO

Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) continues to move through the 
recontracting 
process like a hot knife through butter. Since Kinder Morgan took over NGPL 
parent KN Energy 
last year, the interstate pipeline subsidiary has signed multiple agreements 
and contract 
extensions for gas transportation and storage with its major shippers in the 
Midwest, including 
another deal announced yesterday with Northern Indiana Public Service 
(NIPSCO). 

NGPL and NIPSCO signed a contract extending the terms of several firm 
transportation 
agreements totaling 295,100 MMBtu/d of capacity beginning Dec. 1, 2000 and 
Dec. 1, 2001 
and continuing through Nov. 30, 2002. They also extended the terms of two 
storage agreements 
totaling 10.5 Bcf of capacity beginning Dec. 1, 2000 and April 1, 2001 and 
continuing through 
March 31, 2003. NIPSCO, a NiSource subsidiary, is a regulated utility that 
provides natural gas 
o nearly 700,000 customers and electricity to 416,000 customers across the 
northern third of Indiana. 

"Virtually all of our operationally available capacity is sold out now until 
the fourth quarter of this 
year," said NGPL President Deborah Mcdonald in an interview. 

"Basically about a third of the transportation contracts and a third of the 
storage contracts are 
up for renewal every year. We've been very successful in our efforts 
resigning our three major 
customers [NiGas, NIPSCO and Peoples]." Despite increasing competitive 
pressure from 
Northern Border and Alliance Pipeline, the pipeline also has had surprising 
luck signing 
agreements with marketers and power generators. 

"In contrast to the traditional market of long-haul transportation from the 
Midcontinent and 
Louisiana to Chicago, we have been extending our horizons trying to find a 
new market in 
the marketers rather than the core LDCs. Obviously the contract that we 
signed earlier this
year with Aquila Energy for 500,000 MMBtu of transportation capacity has also 
really helped 
us be successful in our recontracting efforts," Mcdonald said. 

"We also have developed a number of new rate services for gas-fired power 
generators. 
Growth in NGPL will come from natural gas-fired generation. You probably saw 
our press 
release about the Ameren contracts for [construction of 1,700 MW of 
generation along the
NGPL system]. In the aggregate we think we are on target to connect over 
3,000 MW of 
gas-fired generation this year and over 3,000 MW next year as well [which 
would represent 
up to 900 MMcf/d in gas transportation capacity]. 

"Obviously another challenge is going to be [the 1.325 Bcf/d] Alliance 
Pipeline coming into 
the market this fall. It's anyone's guess whether that will really fill up in 
a short period of time. 
I think a lot of that will be coming into Chicago and moving back out on 
Vector. But we're 
ready at Hub America to kind of serve as a giant header system [with Texas 
Eastern as 
an eastbound partner]." 

Mcdonald was not prepared, however, to announce the results of a recent open 
season 
for about 100 MMcf/d of capacity that will be available through a new 
interconnection between 
NGPL and Tetco for eastbound transportation.

Strong Demand Holds Load Factors High Despite Alliance

The introduction of the 1.325 Bcf/d Alliance Pipeline into the North American 
gas market appears to have had less of an impact on gas flows out of western 
Canada than expected, according to representatives of TransCanada PipeLines, 
PG&E Gas Transmission and Alliance. Extremely strong gas demand in the 
Pacific Northwest, California and in the Midwest has produced continued high 
load factors on TransCanada and PG&E GT-NW despite the presence of their huge 
new rival for Western Canadian supply. 

"The contract picture changed significantly on [TransCanada] since the first 
of November and primarily at our Empress, AB, delivery point into the 
TransCanada mainline from the Alberta pipe, but actual physical gas flows [at 
about 6 Bcf/d] have not changed correspondingly," said Klaus Exner, director 
of pipeline system operations at TransCanada. "The big picture overview that 
I would give you is that demand is very high in the Pacific Northwest and 
California and we continue to run at the highest possible load factor down 
that leg of our pipeline system out of Alberta, through British Columbia and 
into the PG&E systems. That hasn't let up at all and we don't foresee that 
letting up." 

PG&E Gas Transmission Spokeswoman Sandra McDonough said PG&E GT-NW has been 
running full at 2.6 Bcf/d for some time and is delivering 900 MMcf/d to 
non-California load in the Pacific Northwest. "We're turning back demand 
right now. Every power plant in this region is running full tilt. Tuscarora 
[Gas Transmission], the Nevada pipeline, is full. Our Northwest deliveries 
are fixed. We're delivering as much as we can deliver right now." 

TransCanada's other major export route out of the Western Canadian 
Sedimentary Basin is the Foothills and Northern Border route into the 
Midwest. It also continues to operate at high load factors. "We didn't see a 
huge drop-off in physical flows post Nov. 1. We've seen the IT volumes come 
up considerably," said Exner. "The one thing that has changed is the 
volatility of the flows. Customers are making frequent intraday nomination 
changes and we're seeing more up and down and day-to-day variations, 
according to the weather and the markets, than we would have when we had a 
higher firm contract level. The fluctuations are driven purely by the price 
differential between AECO and the Dawn Hub in Ontario, which indicates 
whether or not interruptible flow on the mainline is in the money or not." 

Alliance Pipeline spokesman Jack Crawford said the system has been running 
flat out at about 1.325 Bcf/d since the valves were opened for commercial 
service Dec. 1. He also said the pipeline soon would be testing to increase 
flows on the system. It has been estimated that Alliance could increase gas 
flows to 1.5 Bcf/d with existing compression. The additional capacity would 
be divided up among existing shippers, Crawford said. "We haven't cranked up 
the system above the contract capacity yet. We probably won't do that for a 
couple weeks until we get things ironed out. Frankly though, I'm not sure 
Chicago is their best market right now given the pricing in the Pacific 
Northwest and California."

The attached file contains a list of the variables we identified in our 
August 18th meeting.  I tried to break them down into smaller group just for 
organizational purposes.  The items under Prices and Temperatures should be 
easy to gather using the LIM database.  The items in the Other category may 
require more research.  What we have done in the past if we could not find 
the exact variable try and fine a proxy for it.  For example it may be 
difficult to find irrigation usage, but less difficult to find precipitation 
in a region.  Since these two items would intuitively seem to have an inverse 
relationship it may be possible to use precipitation as a proxy for 
irrigation.  After we have begun to research the Other variables we may have 
to come back to you and discuss proxy variables so keep that in mind.  We 
added a column for use to keep track of the statues on each variable this is 
just for us to keep track of where we found the variable or why we did not 
pursue it.  Let me know if we have missed anything or you have subsequently 
thought of anything not on the list.

Note:  Alliance announced an October 30 official in-service date for tariff 
services; however, they will be selling test gas in 
ramp up period.  Right now, these first deliveries are going into the ANR 
system because it is the only interconnect that is 
ready.

Alliance Delayed, But Deliveries Begin Ramping Up

After months of speculation in the industry, Alliance Pipeline confirmed 
yesterday full commercial service will be delayed nearly a month until Oct. 
30. When construction of the system was scheduled nearly three years ago, 
Oct. 2 was the target date for commercial service. 

However, the delay doesn't mean the market won't be getting any Canadian gas 
out of Alliance until the end of October. The pipeline opened one of its 
Chicago delivery valves last Thursday and started selling 50-100 MMcf/d of 
gas into the market. It intends to increase its sales each week eventually 
reaching its full 1.325 Bcf/d load prior to switching to commercial service 
on Oct. 30, said spokesman Jack Crawford. 

"We got Commission approval to actually sell our test gas. Right now I think 
we are dealing with three or four different marketers. Our initial deliveries 
right now are into the ANR system. That's because its basically the only 
connection that is ready, but over the next few weeks we expect they will all 
be ready to go and we will test them all. 

"I'd be surprised if it ends up being regular [volume increases of 100 MMcf/d 
each week] but that's kind of the game plan," said Crawford. "On Oct. 29 it 
will be Alliance selling [1.325 Bcf/d of] test gas, and on Oct. 30 it will be 
shippers nominating at one end and delivering at the other. The market may 
not see much of a difference. We obviously don't want to start charging our 
shippers until we have the confidence that all the systems have been checked 
out." 

The pipeline system is designed to deliver gas from producing regions of 
northeastern British Columbia and northwestern Alberta to the Chicago area 
where the line interconnects with the North American pipeline grid. 
Currently, more than 99% of the total pipeline system has been installed, 
including 14 mainline compressor stations, 37 receipt points in British 
Columbia and Alberta, and 7 delivery points in Illinois. Commissioning 
activities commenced in March, including the flowing of gas into the 
completed sections of line to purge air from the pipe. At present, 
approximately 95% of Alliance has been purged of air. This includes all the 
mainline portion of the system (1,857 miles) from near Gordondale, Alberta to 
the delivery section near Joliet, Illinois and 306 of 434 mile laterals 
receipt portion of the system. Additionally, 25 receipt point meter stations 
have been commissioned. Final commissioning activities are also being 
completed at 14 mainline compressor stations. To date, 6 Bcf of gas is in the 
commissioned mainline and lateral portions of the system, with the ultimate 
line pack targeted at 8 Bcf. 

Crawford said there were a variety of factors that contributed to the delayed 
start-up. "The rain in Saskatchewan delayed us a bit back in July, but we 
managed to catch up on the construction there in August. But it then meant 
that some of our commissioning didn't get going until a little bit later. 
Farther west in Alberta and BC in fact we've had a couple of rain problems. 
In particular, we have one relatively small but fairly long lateral that we 
haven't even been able to get on the right of way yet and that's because of 
rain. 

"Up in BC we've been having trouble with a directional drill of a creek on 
one of our laterals up there," he said. "We're likely to get approval to 
open-cut that creek, but that will take us probably the better part of a 
month. 

"On the downstream end, we had hoped to get more of our downstream 
connections right now. We are testing one, but some of the others aren't 
quite ready yet. We're ready, but they are not. Then of course there is a 
fairly complex interaction between the pipeline and the [Aux Sable liquids] 
plant. We haven't had a chance to work on that yet. So when you look at all 
of those things, the question was when could we establish a date when all 
this stuff would be done and we would be operational. We spent a fair amount 
of time with our shippers and they mentioned one other pipeline that was 
being delayed one day at a time drove them to distraction. We agreed we would 
pick one of three dates, all Mondays: Oct. 2, Oct. 16 or Oct. 30, and we just 
had to pick one that we felt confident in." 

Besides the timing of service, there has been another important question on 
the minds of many market observers. Will the gas Alliance ships come Oct. 30 
be incremental gas or gas that would have been flowing through TransCanada. 

"I don't think it's going to be purely either way," said Crawford. "Lots of 
guys are targeting for Nov. 1 to bring their new gas on to start the gas year 
so it all depends on how much shows up. It's not a big secret that we've had 
some wet weather and some of the drilling and completion work hasn't gotten 
done. That's likely to have some affect on it as well. That's a delay though. 
How long are people going to pay $6 for gas? Boy, people are going to have a 
lot of money for drilling and projects."

Note:  This text was released today by Natural Gas Intelligence after an 
interview with Alliance personnel

Construction Completed on Alliance Pipeline

The C$4.6 billion Alliance natural gas and liquids pipeline, designed to 
transport 1.325 Bcf/d from northeast 
British Columbia to Chicago, has completed its construction phase and now is 
commissioning the main line, 
laterals, compressors and supervisory equipment. 

The final weld was completed last week near Regina, SK, and Alliance now is 
injecting linepack. The 1,857 
mile mainline is stretched to the Chicago area from northeastern BC. October 
is still the target month to begin 
service of the pipeline, which will carry both natural gas and liquids. 

The pipeline system will transport natural gas through a 36-inch diameter 
high-pressure line. There will be 14 
mainline compressor stations: seven in Canada and seven in the U.S. When it 
began construction in 1999, 
Alliance already had commitments from 37 shippers for 15-year contracts worth 
a total of $8.2 billion.

The large volumes of gas Alliance will haul from western Canada into the U.S. 
Midwest is expected to have 
a major impact on existing pipelines, markets and prices. TransCanada 
PipeLines already has filed for new 
tolls to compensate for customers which have failed to renew firm contracts 
on its line and instead are routing 
their gas through Alliance. New gas that makes its way into the Chicago area 
could be sent on to southern 
Ontario through the Chicago-to-Dawn Vector Pipeline, scheduled to open in 
late October with intial capacity 
of 720 Bcf/d.  The Foothills/Northern Border route from western Canada into 
the Midwest also is expected to 
see some slack. 

Alliance spokesman Jay Godfrey said last month that "when October comes we 
won't be in the position that 
we'll have to start filling the pipe. It essentially already is going to be 
full." Connections to 37 gas plants are 
already complete. 

Investors in Alliance Pipeline Limited Partnerships include affiliates of 
Coastal (14.4%), Enbridge (21.4%), 
Fort Chicago Energy Partners LP (26%), Williams (14.6%) and Westcoast Energy 
(23.6%).

In its first week, the ThinkBank's Idea Vault received more than 35 ideas 
from all over the world!  And those ideas aren't just sitting there -- oh, 
no.  Connections have been made, dialogues have been started, things are 
happening at the ThinkBank.   
What's your interest rate?  Come to the ThinkBank today.


Did you ask a question at the all-employee meeting last month that was not 
answered?  Take a look in eMeet.  We've posted responses to questions from 
the meeting, as well as another anonymous question to the Office of the 
Chairman.  See the "Office of the Chairman" category in eMeet.


Stop by the eSpeak Archives to see what was discussed in Cindy Olson's 
EnronOptions event.  Great questions, great answers.  They're all in the 
transcript on eSpeak.

Today the Commission issued a tolling order on our request for rehearing in 
the PNM capacity docket.  As you recall, we asked for rehearing of the 
Commission's requirement that TW's acquisition of capacity be limited to the 
summer months.  The tolling order is simply FERC's way of buying time to 
consider our request.  In the absence of Commission action within 30 days of 
our rehearing request, our request would have been deemed denied...so we're 
doing well so far.   There is no deadline for the Commission to act on our 
request.  I'll watch to see whether it appears on the Commission's agenda.

El Paso Blanco Mis-Measurement - The 518,000 MMBtu of gas agreed upon in our 
settlement letter with El Paso has been paid back to TW as of October 25.  

Southwest Gas - SWG agreed to amend the start date of their transport 
contract to November 15.  TW resold the space along with an additional 1000 
MMBtu/d for a total of 15,000 MMBtu/d to Sempra Energy at $0.15 (slightly 
above market but equal to the rate SWG was originally paying).  Morgan 
Gottsponer sold Sempra the gas for this transport deal.

Burlington Resources' Val Verde Plant - We held another conference call with 
BR this week to finally resolve the outstanding issue of TW's obligation to 
take 250,000 MMBtu/d from Burlington's Val Verde plant.  Operational 
restrictions and San Juan temperatures seasonally affect the amount of volume 
TW is capable of receiving from Val Verde.  BR had claimed damages of nearly 
$3,000,000 from having to sell San Juan gas into less attractive markets 
because TW could not take all their volume.  

Upon investigation, there were actually very few days in which TW hampered 
Burlington's deliveries; but TW does have an exposure here for a contractual 
commitment that operationally we cannot meet on a year-round basis without 
spending several million dollars for additional compression.   In exchange 
for Burlington signing an amended operating agreement that meets both parties 
needs, TW has agreed to refund $100,000 of transport charges to BR for gas 
they moved this summer down the San Juan lateral.

Transport Options Program - Comments and interventions on this filing are due 
from interested parties by the close of business Monday October 30th.  

Duke Energy - We are working on a 100,000 MMBtu/d east-to-east transport deal 
with Duke beginning in January 2001 for one to two years at a rate of $.02 
-.03.  This deal would justify the capital expenditure to replace the coolers 
at WT-2 and give TW another 50,000 MMBtu/d flow capacity on the west Texas 
lateral.  However, Duke wants alternative flow capability west to the border 
at an incremental $.06.  As an alternative, we are proposing an index-based 
sharing mechanism for the west flow but Duke is balking (current market for 
calendar 2001 net of fuel is $.205).

We are pleased to announce that Jim Noles, president and chief operating 
officer of Enron Wind, will assume the additional role of chief executive 
officer, effective immediately.  Jim will continue to be based in Houston.

Jim joined Enron Wind as its president in May of this year.  Prior to that 
appointment, Jim was managing director for Enron's Operations Support Group 
of Global Asset Operations and provided operations and maintenance oversight

Previously, Jim worked with Enron International's Asset Management team where 
he formed the North American Asset Management Group to provide operation and 
maintenance services to Enron North America's electricity generation peaker 
plants that entered into service in 1999.  Jim joined Enron in 1995 as vice 
president of Enron Development Corp. to head up its Middle East Regional 
Development team.

Prior to joining Enron, Jim was an international marketer for TRW's Systems 
Integration Group with responsibilities in the Middle East.  Jim served in 
the U.S. Army for 25 years, culminating his career as a Brigadier General.  
His education includes a bachelor's degree from the University of North 
Alabama and a master's of public administration from the University of 
Alabama.

Jim has a solid track record in development, sales, operations, and 
leadership and has had a positive impact on Enron Wind's growth and 
profitability in the short period since joining the company.  Please join us 
in congratulating Jim on his promotion and new responsibilities.

*********************************************************

Cold November weather, with heating degree-days 22 percent above normal 
through
the twenty-fifth, fueled withdrawals from storage that CERA estimates will 
average
approximately 8.5 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day for the month, near the 
all-time
record for November set in 1995. This is approximately 5.0 Bcf per day higher 
than
the previously expected withdrawal rate under normal weather conditions. The 
result
is that storage inventories as of the end of the month are about 500 Bcf 
below the
year-earlier level and are on track to dip well into record low territory by 
the end of
the winter (see Table 1).

For December, normal weather would result in storage withdrawals of 17.0 Bcf 
per
day on average for the month. At that rate, storage inventories would fall 
below 2.0
trillion cubic feet (Tcf) by the end of the year, the first time that has 
ever occurred.
By the end of March CERA expects working inventories to be reduced to 606 Bcf 
in
the United States, compared with the previous record low of 758 Bcf.

This weather and high withdrawal rates have moved prices higher within the 
wide
and volatile range between residual fuel oil and distillate, with gas prices 
moving
farther above those of resid ($4.75 to $5.00) and closer to the price of 
distillate fuel
oil (approximately $7.00). Strength in the oil market has kept the 
resid-distillate
range high, but should gas test either boundary of this range, the price of 
either
distillate or resid would move as well. Under normal weather CERA now expects
December prices to average $6.25 at the Henry Hub, a higher level within this 
range
reflective of reduced storage inventories.

Although prices have abated somewhat in recent days and will continue to rise 
and
fall with weather and weather forecasts, fundamentals now are so tight that a 
return
to cold weather would quickly drive prices back above $6.50 and potentially 
above
$7.00 at the Henry Hub. It is only at that level or above that any significant
additional demand response is likely, and even then such a response would 
require
time. The possibility of curtailments of interruptible loads late this winter 
has grown,
while the possibility of significant price relief appears increasingly remote.

Cathy Bulf (918-591-5143) just called to negotiate the contract extension.  
Capacity is 10000 to Needles and 10000 to Topock, both expiring end of Jan 
2001.  Her bids are through Oct 2001 at .16 plus fuel or through Mar 2002 at 
current rate of .131 plus fuel.  What is our strategy?  The spreads have 
tightened since last week.  She has to be notified by ASAP, so she can 
exercise her ROFR.

It still looks like Saturday for unit #3. They are working to get the 
compressor back on the skid, and then they will start it up 
and do web deflections on the unit. Hopefully all will go well.

It's that time or year again!!!


Once there was a season when Texas and A & M football teams were not
scheduled to play each other.

It seemed so unusual, that the coaches of both teams got together and
decided that there should be some sort of competition between the 2 teams
because of their great rivalry.

They decided on a week long ice-fishing competition.
The team who caught the most fish at the end of the week would win.

So on a cold northern South Dakota lake (a neutral site so no one would
whine about home field advantage), they began their contest.

The 1st day, after 8 hours of fishing, A&M had caught 100 fish and Texas
had 0.

At the end of the 2nd day, A&M had caught 200 fish and Texas had 0.

That evening the Texas Coach got his team together and said, "I suspect
some kind of cheating is taking place".

The next morning he dressed one of his players in maroon and white and sent
him over to the camp to act as a spy.

At the end of the day, the spy came back to report to the coach.

The coach asked, "Well, how about it, are the Aggies cheating?"

"They sure are", the Texas player reported, "They're cutting holes in the
ice!"

yes... and there are so many choices in that area.. I have bought and 
returned 2 types...  I'm pushing that we do something.  Bob Martinez gave me 
the task of running Technical Brown Bag sessions for Upper Management to show 
them technology.. Palm Pilot type hardware was what my first session was 
going to be on..

Audrey -- the right answer is probably yes I mind .. But, I do not have a 
problem with her going and doing it.  I understand where she is coming from, 
and I do not like being a road block.  Do you know what she is planning to 
purchase... and also she understands we are in the process of selecting a 
standard..

Jean, Michelle would like to get to go ahead and get one now.  It would be 
easier for her to go out this weekend and purchase one and expense it out.   
Would you mind if she does?

Also, we (GPG) do not have a standard for Palm Pilots.. actually, from what 
I've found it doesn't look like they are leaning towards Palm Pilots.. Can 
Michelle wait for the standard? or we can just order her one now.   I'll

It is amazing and yet not surprising how much Enron has accomplished in the=

that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron=01,s business goals, and w=

As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as t=

program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of=
=20
their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the=20
program.  =20

Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package=

and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron=01,s continued=
=20
success.  Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and=
=20
Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decid=
ed=20
to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.

On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for=

calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program).  =
It is=20

effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligib=

on that date (please see note below).  The new program, which is subject to=

final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, is as follows:

? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to=20
eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and=20
international companies/locations.
? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base=20

December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some=20

? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000.

of stock options.

Why commit your talent and energy to Enron?  EnronOptions =01) Your Stock O=

In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =

PG&E Market Center - The first "true blue" California Market Center deal has 
been completed.  200,000 MMBtu/day was borrowed from PG&E in the month of 
September and sold to USGT as a Ride and Park deal at $.10/MMBtu/day.  TW has 
completed payback to PG&E as of September 19th.

Market Services Roundtable - Our monthly roundtable discussion with TW Market 
Services was held this week.   We gave a brief presentation on the proposed 
Transport Options tariff filing and its impact to the TW system.

Sempra Energy Trading - We attended Sempra's weather derivatives briefing 
chaired by their chief meteorologist Dan Guertin.  Dan's forecast for the 
winter of '00-01 seems to track with the CPC's.  Dan also believes that this 
will be an "oceanographic neutral" winter with no El Nino or La Nina 
influences.  He sees slightly above average temperatures for the western 
marketplace and a relatively "normal" winter pattern (30 yr. avg.) for the 
mid-continent (i.e. cooler than last winter).

As far as monthly variations, he is predicting a cooler than usual November - 
December, and a slightly warmer than usual pattern for the remainder of the 
heating season.  He has promised to make his presentation information 
available to the briefing attendees.  If we can secure a copy, we'll pass it 
on.

El Paso Blanco Mis-Measurement - The settlement letter to net out the 
imbalances between TW, NNG, and El Paso was drafted and sent to El Paso this 
week for their signature.  El Paso has indicated they will respond next week 
as most of their management is scrambling with the recent reorganization 
announcement.

Burlington Resources Val Verde Plant - Facility Planning indicates it will 
take another 1000 hp compressor costing $1.8 - 2.0 million in order for TW to 
be able to meet our contractual requirements year-round with Burlington in 
San Juan.  With this uneconomical prospect, we will try and negotiate a 
yearly average receipt capability versus a daily receipt capability.  
Burlington reported in Gas Daily this week that their overall production will 
be down for the third quarter due to "processing and treating efficiency 
problems associated with summer heat in the San Juan Basin and continued 
mechanical downtime."

Koch - An initial meeting was held with Koch Midstream Services Company 
regarding the Coyanosa plant currently connected to Transwestern's most 
southern area of the West Texas lateral.  Koch does not have equity gas of 
their own at this plant but has offered to provide us the names of companies 
who do process gas at the plant.   Tailgate gas from the Coyanosa plant is 
currently sold at the Waha index.  Koch's Coyanosa plant is one plant which 
would potentially provide additional supplies (150 MMcf/d total plant 
capacity) to Transwestern as part of the Gomez to Puckett tie-in project.

USGT
Sold 20,000 MMBtu/d of Daily Firm space moving gas for the weekend from PG&E 
Topock to SoCal Needles at $.10/MMBtu.  This was somewhat of a novel deal in 
that the California price spreads opened up and gas became trapped at PG&E.  
Once our station 4 compressor becomes fully operational, this opportunity 
will likely dry up.  

Enron N.A.
Representatives contacted us this week to discuss our possible participation 
in a gas storage field using a depleted reservoir on Navajo land near 
Farmington, NM.  Third party developers approached ENA looking for assistance 
in moving the project forward.

New Tariff Services
Marketing consensus was reached to delay any further development of 
Transwestern's Hourly Firm Service until the potential markets of power plant 
loads become operational.  During this interim period, Park 'n Ride services 
provided on an intra-day basis shall be priced incrementally higher than Park 
'n Ride services provided on a timely basis.  Any resulting market response 
will provide indications of market willingness to pay premium transport rates 
for hourly transportation service.

El Paso 
El Paso Merchant Services needs to re-scrub their verbal offer to 
Transwestern of a $15 Million lump sum "pre-payment" option of fuel 
monetization for their combined 65,000 MMBtu/d of San Juan to California 
capacity.  El Paso did not take into consideration the different termination 
dates of the two contracts (25,000 MMBtu/d PG&E permanent release contract, 
and 40,000 MMBtu/d Gallup expansion contract) in their analysis.  A revised 
proposed lump sum payment offer is expected mid-next week.

El Paso Field Services
Met with EP representatives to discuss a possible interconnect near WT-1.  
The I/C would be sized for 40,000 MMBtu/d.  EP proposes to pay for and set 
compression to flow this gas into our high pressure line and has agreed to a 
volume commitment of 20,000 MMBtu/d for up to 2 years.  An added advantage is 
most of the volume would come from the constrained Atoka area which would 
allow Agave to increase deliveries to TW.

Caithness Corp.
Caithness has decided to move forward on their 1000 Mw generation project in 
Northwest Arizona.  The 2-phase project would initially consume 80,000 
MMBtu/d of gas.  The proposed location is 40 miles south of TW's line near 
Wickieup, AZ.  We are meeting with Caithness reps next week.  Projected 
in-service date for the plant is early 2002.

WT-2 Cooler Expansion
Level B cost estimates are being prepared.  Revenue / cost savings 
assumptions predict $500,000 annual revenue to support the expenditure.  Once 
installed, the project would give TW an additional 50,000 MMBtu/d capacity on 
the east end.  Financial evaluations will be done once the cost estimate is 
received.

NGPL Winkler Interconnect
NGPL notified us this week the reactivated point should be operationally 
ready to flow gas on July 17 (about 2 weeks ahead of schedule).  This will 
hopefully provide new system supply to TW's east end of about 80 - 
90,000/MMBtu/d.

Subject: I didn't think I was finished negotiating


Lorraine, I wanted to send you an e-mail about our negotiations regarding
TW/VV interconnect.  I don't want you to feel like I am trying to renegotiate
something you think we agreed to last week.

When we were talking last week about concessions I was seeking from TW in
lieu of underperfomance at the VV interconnect, I gave the example of
reducing our alternate delivery rate on the Jack Rabbit agreement, but I
wanted to talk to you further about it.  We agreed that you would call me
this week to talk about it.  It was my intention that the negotiations were
not over yet, but that we need to talk further.

Quite simply, a discounted rate on an alternate delivery point for an
agreement where I don't have a lot of volume does not do much for
Burlington.  The lack of TW's ability to accept nominated volumes from Val
Verde as mutually agreed to in the IPOA is a big and expensive issue to
Burlington.  It significantly limits our ability to operate the plant
efficiently, honor nominations of third party shippers on the system and it
is causing BR to nominate extra volume into the EPNG system which is
constrained.  All of these factors cost Burlington a significant amount of
money.

Some of the concession I am seeking include:  The same discounted rate to
make alternate deliveries into EPNG as TW at Blanco on agreement 25597.  The
same discounted rate for alternate receipts north of the LaPlatta compressor
station which in contrary to the language on agreement 25597.  I realize that
BR would be alternate firm, but the agreement would be higher in the queue
than interruptible.

Alternatively, what about terminating 25597 retroactively back to August 1.
The agreement expires at the end of the year and I really don't need the way
it is currently structured.  I have an IT agreement for $.03 with all of the
flexibility that I am looking for on 25597.

I have not sold this idea to my boss or anyone else in management.  We have
had a conceptual meeting about this issue.  It was agreed that our first
option was not to ask TW to spend a bunch of money to bring you into contract
compliance.  Instead we wanted to work with you to find some common ground.

The bottom line is that you have to give me something to take to my
management.  Please call me to discuss this.  I really do want to keep these
negotiation up beat.  I think past negotiations have not gone as well as you
or I would have liked.  I really look forward to talking to you and working
something out that is agreeable to both companies.

News : EnronOnline Forms Alliances with HoustonStreet and True Quote 
Time:  2:30 PM (CST) Jul 12, 2000 

HoustonStreet Exchange has branched out into realms of the top energy 
e-commerce 
platforms today by signing an agreement to post the North American 
electricity and 
natural gas prices of EnronOnline. The prices will be posted automatically on 
HoustonStreet.com and traders will be able to act on the EnronOnline prices 
via either 
platform. The addition of EnronOnline pricing will correspond with the launch 
of 
HoustonStreet's natural gas platform in September, the companies said.

Enron also signed an agreement today to post its gas and power prices 
simultaneously 
on True Quote.com. EnronOnline has conducted commodity transactions worth 
more 
than $90 billion in 2000. It posts two-way prices for more than 800 products 
in global 
energy and commodities markets.

Subject: FERC Meeting This Morning - Order on El Paso Capacity Allocation



Chairman Hoecker announced that FERC will hold a special meeting Nov. 1 to 
issue a proposed order detailing possible remedies to the California 
wholesale market based on two investigations currently underway.

Only one item was discussed - an order resolving the Amoco complaint over El 
Paso's capacity allocation.  In the order, the Commission finds that El 
Paso's allocation of delivery point capacity at Topock is unjust & 
unreasonable.  The Commission directs El Paso to assign primary point rights 
to its shippers using a one-time assignment process outlined in the order.  
If elections for primary point capacity exceed available space, El Paso will 
pro rate the space and allow shippers to select other primary points in an 
iterative fashion until all shippers have primary point rights equal to their 
firm capacity rights.  Chairman Hoecker said this case illustrates the fact 
that overbooking pipeline capacity is even more problematic that the 
overbooking of airline capacity.

El Paso Field Services - EPFS has agreed to go forward on a new interconnect 
with TW in Eddy County, NM.  The size of the new interconnect will be 40,000 
MMBtu/d.  EPFS has agreed to pay $165,000 towards the cost estimate of 
$280,000 as well as commit 12,500 MMBtu/d throughput for a period of 2 
years.  Facility Planning is opening a new work order and we have begun 
drafting the Interconnect Agreement and the OBA for the new point.  The point 
should be active in 60 - 90 days.

Arizona Public Service - has still not signed the Transport Request for the 
14,000 MMBtu/d April - October 2001 capacity.  The current spread is $0.375 - 
$0.40.  

Red Cedar - has finally decided on their transport volume under our new 5 
year agreement.  Contract documentation is being prepared.

Sempra - has again exercised their option under their Gallup contract for 
21,500 MMBtu/d Permian to California for 1 year starting 11/1/01. The 
contract rate is $0.30 plus fuel.

Texaco is moving up to 100,000 MMBtu/d from PG&E Topock to Mojave starting 
8/21 through 10/31/00.  TW collected an incremental $.025/MMBtu for this move 
or approximately $160,000.

El Paso Outage-
 Current reports are the Office of Pipeline Safety is demanding El Paso hydro 
test, X-ray and ultrasonic test all 330 miles of pipe that is currently out 
of service due to last weekend's explosion.  It appears the 1 Bcf/d capacity 
to California may be off-line for up to one month.  

Related Developments
  --SoCal released capacity on El Paso for October 2000 to Dynegy at a 
reservation charge of $1.00/MMBtu.
  --Volume on various TW interconnect points has picked up on the east end 
including the new NGPL Winkler point.
  --We are receiving incremental volume from El Paso at Window Rock and 
collecting a portion of the market premium. 

Transport Options - a working group meeting with customers has been scheduled 
for Thursday August 31.  The objective will be to get everyone comfortable 
and build a coalition of support behind our new Options Tariff filing.

Burlington Resources - We held a conference call with John Hinton, Marketing 
Director, regarding the current operation of the Val Verde plant.  Our data 
indicates with the exception of a few T-5 temperature limit days, TW has been 
able to accept over 98% of the gas nominated by the plant.  In addition, for 
the last 2 years, the plant has been delivering gas with CO2 in excess of our 
specs.  We agreed our latest amendment draft could use some stronger language 
in terms of TW's obligations beyond a "best efforts" basis.   John indicated 
a willingness to work together as they were trying to schedule a delivery of 
215,000 MMBtu to us for Hub delivery.   We agreed to talk again next week 
once the volume test was complete.

SoCal Windowing - a conference call was held with Mike Nelson, Rich Jolly, 
Steve January, Terry Galassini, Darrell Schoolcraft, Ray Smith, Gary Choquet, 
and David Roentsch regarding TW's pressures and delivery capability at SoCal 
Needles.  Analysis indicates we have 35 pounds of pressure drop from our 
Needles measurement station to the SoCal station across the river 
(approximately two miles).  SoCal maintains that if we can give them 830 psi 
at their station, they can take the full 750,000 MMBtu under the contract 
(this translates to 870 psi at TW's meter with our current situation).  Our 
problem has been if we lose volume out of San Juan or a unit on the West of 
Thoreau leg, then we lose line pack and then pressure at the border.  SoCal 
acknowledges they have a motor out of service at Needles but plan to have it 
back on line in October.  But they maintain this won't help resolve the 
situation.  Operations has agreed to look at a number of things including 
changing the type of meter at Needles, looking at some station valve 
replacement, and mechanical condition of stations 1 through 4.  Marketing 
agreed to estimate the revenue impact of the pressure drop and lower volume 
delivery to help justify any capital expenditures.

Hi Sarabeth:

At Peter's request I am sending you a copy of our most recent short term
outlook and a presentation on the short term outlook.  I will send a copy of
our long term presentation in a separate email.  Please feel free to pick
and choose what you would like me to talk about.  The material is clearly
too much to discuss in the hour we have.

I look forward to meeting with you.

Subject: interactive open season test packages

The interactive open season test packages are loaded on ios.ets.enron.com.  
We put in the change where shippers must bid on the full capacity of the 
package, no partial capacities are allowed.  Even though the package with the 
3 month term has been loaded, we can remove it if we need to.  The following 
test user have been set up for testing.

user id  password package 15 volume package 16 volume

test1  user1  20000   0
test2  user2  20000   0
test3  user3  20000   0
test4  user4  20000   0
test5  user5  20000   49000
test6  user6  20000   49000
test7  user7  0   49000
test8  user8  0   49000
test9  user9  0   49000
test10  user10  0   49000

This iosadmin password is k97hyt86

Because the ios application hasn't been thoroughly used since February of 
1999, it is very important to do this testing.  I you need us to reset the 
bids or the end time, or if you notice any problems while testing, please 
page us at (877)497-3254.

Michelle, Steve had to re-schedule his Derivatives class for next month due 
to a scheduling conflict.  In his place, I have scheduled you so you would 
not have to wait until August.  I hope you are available.  (smile)

Your class is scheduled for July 11 and 12.  Please mark your calendar..

Transport Options - FERC has issued a draft order suspending our proposed 
Transport Options tariff sheets until May 1, 2001 and accepting them subject 
to the outcome of a technical conference.  The technical conference is to 
take place within 120 days of the order and will address issues raised in 
protests.

CIG Tumbleweed - We are working with firm shippers on CIG who produce gas out 
of the Raton Basin and sell it into El Paso, NNG, and SPS/Nichols.  With 
current basis spreads going to California, the market may motivate the 
producers to move some primary firm transport gas onto the TW system.  

Burlington Resources - Burlington indicated this week they have signed the 
amended Val Verde interconnect and operating agreement and returned it to TW.

West Texas Gas - We executed an east to east deal with this co-op for 
$.065/MMBtu on volume of approximately 1500 MMBtu/d.

Allocation Extension - Capacity west on TW will be constrained an extra 3 
days till November 30.  The re-grout at station 4 was delayed by several days 
as extreme cold temperatures prevented the new grout from drying; they are 
also having difficulty getting the unit aligned.  Also, the piston rods on a 
unit at station 2 are being pulled and sent to Odessa, Texas for rebuild.

You asked; we answered.  Many of you shared your ideas with us about what you

PNM - The FERC accepted TW's new tariff filing for purchasing capacity on 
PNM's Blanco to Rio Puerco line!!!  The acceptance is conditioned by TW being 
limited to acquire this off-system capacity to the Apr-Oct period and we must 
file a report with the Commission at the end of the 2 year period detailing 
what impact, if any, this proposal has had on the market.

El Paso Blanco Mis-Measurement - El Paso pipeline called this week and agreed 
with TW that they had been erroneously calibrating their Blanco meter for the 
last several years and did in fact owe TW gas volume.  They would like to 
offset the balance owed TW against volume NNG owes El Paso.  Market Services 
is verifying the net volume figures.  The settlement volume proposed by El 
Paso is 91% of everything we requested.  We will attempt to take the 
approximately 651,000 MMBtu back at Window Rock over a 30 day period 
beginning in October.

Arizona Public Service - We have re-negotiated their FT agreement prior to 
the ROFR being triggered at the end of September.  APS will renew its 8,000 
MMBtu/d Permian to Needles agreement at the max rate for one year as well as 
the provision if they release the capacity at greater than max rate, TW and 
APS will share the upside 50/50.

Red Cedar Gathering - We received the signed letter agreement from Red Cedar 
which commits them to full reimbursement of the capital expense necessary to 
increase the Arkansas Loop meter from 200,000 MMBtu to 300,000 MMBtu/d.  We 
expect this meter increase to be completed and flowing in excess of the 
current 200,000 MMBtu/d by January 1, 2001.

System Expansions - We have updated our cost estimates and RAROC for 
expansions of the I-B Link, Blanco to Thoreau and mainline segments of the 
pipe.  We will follow up with PNM today on cost comparisons.  The TW 
expansion appears to be more cost effective than PNM's. 

The BP Amoco/Vastar merger is set for completion today.  Amoco will begin 
marketing Vastar's equity gas beginning 11/1/00.  Amoco has expressed a high 
level of interest on the remaining capacity from Ignacio to Blanco and from 
Red Cedar to Blanco for 2001.  They will provide a firm offer to TW next week.

Line Outages:
The September 13th allocation due to compressor failure in TW's West of 
Thoreau Area allowed for 42,0000 MMBtu of IT volumes to flow from PG&E Topock 
to Socal Needles.  Revenue generated at max rate equaled $10,500 to partially 
offset the commodity and fuel loss.

EOG Resources - EOG executed the Interconnect and Operating agreement for the 
15,000 MMBtu/d we expect from their new well.  Transwestern has initiated 
landowner notifications which  takes at least 30 days.  We continue to 
negotiate with EOG on becoming a new shipper and taking firm transport on TW. 

Burlington Resources Val Verde Plant - TW's ability to accept the contracted 
volume from the plant on a consistent basis continues to be an issue.  High 
temperatures and volume flow in the San Juan region have reduced our 
capacity.  BR is requesting relief to offset the monetary impact of gas that 
was shut in or sold at lesser margins in other locations.  We are working 
with Facility Planning to determine what capital / equipment may be necessary 
to meet our contractual demand.

Summary of COGA conference follows.  FYI - at the time of the conference, the 
conference organizers indicated that all speakers presentations would be made 
available at the COGA.org websit after the conference.  However, COGA is 
currently experiencing difficulties in actually getting each speaker to 
provide this information.  I have requested a copy of the Interstate Pipeline 
(CIG/Questar/El Paso/Transcolorado/Western/NWPL) presentations to be mailed 
to me and will circulate them when I receive them.  They provide interesting 
summaries of pipeline expansion programs. 

Main conference themes which seem to be repeated among various speackers 
include the following points:

  -  Annual U.S. domestic requirements are headed towards the 30 TCF point 
sooner than expected.  One attributable reason for the higher than expected 
growth rate was the impact of growing internet & cellular activity of the 
nation.  It was estimated that these combined markets have grown from 
representing 2% of total electrical requirements of the nation to 
approximately an 8-10% range which will be sustainable from this point 
forward.  In addition, overall healthy economic growth of the nation also 
contributes to the increase in domestic gas demand.  
  -   Power River Basin coalbed methane production has the highest potential 
growth opportunity for Rocky production.
 -   Currently the companies most active in Rocky Mountain exploration & 
production are experiencing a shortage of geologists, engineers, and field 
personnel which they fear may impact the desired rate of field  developement 
- Rig counts in the Rockies are on the rise, but additional rig availability 
is also an issue which may impact rate of production.
- The only pipelines which actively promoted access to Waha markets for Rocky 
production were El Paso and Transcolorado.
- El Paso was already encouraging interest in the 1.2 BCF of capacity which 
El Paso Merchant Services currently has on their system which will expire 
October 01. 
- General conference discussion opinion is that the  Alliance in-service 
impact will be fairly neutral to market demand and gas prices for Rocky 
production.  They continue to be optimistic with their growth opportunities 
and price expectations.


Customer Meetings:

Western Gas Resources - met with Bill Koch (project developer), Chris O'Dell 
(Texas gas marketer), Andrew Carter and Andrew Richmond (western region gas 
marketers).  Western is in the process of purchasing some NNG lines which are 
in close proximity to the most southern part of Transwestern's West Texas 
lateral.   Western would eventually like to deliver treated gas into this 
line,  once Traswestern cleans the line and finalizes the Gomez to Puckett 
Tie-Over, in order to access our Waha markets.    Upside potential exists to 
eventually have access to two Western plants  totaling approximately 150 
MMcf/d of supplies through this arrangement.    TW would most likely have to 
enter into some form of transportation agreement with Western in order to 
justify the $2MM price tag for the Gomez to Puckett Tie-Over.

Aquila - Met with Tori Campbell, Goerge Nunnemaker, Mark Magliery and Nick 
Thomas to discuss general TW issues.

Southwest Gas - Conversations with SWG indicate that somewhere along the 
construction path for the interconnect, TW approved the installation of the 
meter bypass piping (we are waiting for engineering to confirm this).  If 
this is the case, we will ask SWG to install skillets or padlock the valves 
so it cannot be used without TW approval.  In addition, we are proposing to 
amend the start date of the SWG transport contract so that TW may resell the 
unused space in early November on a daily firm basis.  

USGT - US Gas Transportation is protesting the Market Center deal we 
negotiated during our brief September outage.  We re-negotiated the original 
invoice from $140,000 down to $113,000.  USGT has countered with $65,000 
citing mis-communication on the original deal.

Plains Farmer's Co-op - Higher gas prices have created an additional level of 
credit exposure across our customer base in terms of transportation 
balancing.  For September, this small Co-op had accumulated a balance payable 
to TW of approximately $440,000.  The customer indicated they would be 
sending us a payment of $250,000 but so far has only sent in $75,000.  Our 
credit department has demanded a Letter of Credit be put in place for 
$500,000.

NATURAL GAS REPORT--RESIDENTIAL GAS COSTS RISING
Residential costs for gas will rise this winter as the wholesale cost of
natural gas has doubled since last year. Local distribution companies
will feel opposing pressures of reducing the impact on customers,
while recouping their costs.

* This is not a one-year phenomenon. Wholesale prices are expected
to remain high through 2003.

* Rising gas prices were previously overshadowed by high heating
oil costs, but the spotlight will soon turn to gas as residential prices
could rise by 50 percent or more.

The Performance Evaluation Process (PEP) system is now open through Friday,=
=20
Nov. 17, for all employees to solicit and provide performance feedback.  Th=
is=20
process is powerful . . . if we provide meaningful feedback.

Management, when determining performance ratings, participating in PRC=20
meetings, and providing feedback to employees, depends on the comments=20
received via PEP.  For the users of PEP information to fully understand the=
=20
employee=01,s performance and the ratings identified, specific comments are=
=20
needed to explain each rating, including the overall rating.  It's most=20
beneficial to describe specifically what the employee did and why their=20
action was productive or why it needs improvement.

Comments on areas of strength as well as suggesting areas needing improveme=
nt=20
are both important.  Just as each of us needs feedback and coaching to=20
improve our skills in sports or other pursuits, we also need to know what a=
nd=20
how we can improve our work skills and behaviors.  We all benefit from=20
constructive feedback.

Please actively participate in the year-end PEP process and make your input=
=20
meaningful.

PEP Feedback Tips:
? Provide feedback when requested.
? Rate only those skills and behaviors you have observed this year.
? Provide specific comments with specific examples.
? Indicate performance needs improvement when appropriate.


Some Feedback Examples:


Skill/Behavior=09Ineffective
=09Feedback=09Improved
=09=09Feedback
Communication=09"Jack communicates well."=09"Jack was called on to provide =
written=20
updates for the Ajax project and he clearly conveyed pertinent information=

that was easy to read, timely and suited for his audience.  The Accounting =
&=20
Finance management team commented on how his reports saved them time."
Teamwork=09"Sue=01,s a poor team player."=09"When we got to =01+crunch=01, =
time sending out year-end=20
reports, Sue chose to spend a day preparing her goals for next year, instea=
d=20
of pitching in and helping check figures and box up reports with everyone=
=20
else.  We missed the shipping deadline and our reports were received a day=
=20
late.  This impacted our customers and caused our team to miss an important=
=20
goal."
Innovation=09"Jennifer comes up with great new ideas."=09"From reading an a=
rticle on data=20
transmitting devices, Jennifer identified a tool she thought could be=20
utilized in our remote gas measurement applications.  Now implemented, the=
=20
remote measurement device has saved us significant monies and time."
Leadership=09"Tom often displays inappropriate leadership skills."=09"Altho=
ugh Tom closes=20
big deals and contributes significantly to the success of ETS, he lacks the=
=20
ability to gain the support and commitment of others when dealing with=20
support groups across departmental lines.  For greater success, he should=
=20
listen more and provide rationale for his ideas and directives."
Technical=09"Bill=01,s technical skills are weak."=09"On three occasions, B=
ill misaligned=20
columns or overlaid critical data when updating departmental, electronic=20
spreadsheets.  These errors caused more than 30 hours of rework and=20
approximately 8 hours of overtime to fix the mistakes."



For additional information or assistance on providing performance feedback,=
=20
please contact your HR Rep or Roger Sumlin at 713-345-7967.

Thanks, in advance, for your participation in this very important feedback=
=20
process.

the
run dialog box. It should have read "N:\common\ie5\i386\setup.exe" .  
I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. If you have any

Calpine Announces Development of 600-MW Energy Center

Calpine Corporation announced that through a development agreement with Adair 
International Oil 

and Gas, Inc. it has secured the rights to develop, build, own and operate a 
600-MW natural gas-fired 

electricity generating facility near the town of Thermal in Riverside County, 
CA. The $275 million Teayawa

 Energy Center will be located on the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla 
Indians' land through a long-term 

lease agreement between Calpine and the Torres Martinez. 

Construction of the project may begin as soon as mid-2001, with commercial 
operation slated to begin in 

late 2003. The project will interconnect with an existing transmission line 
adjacent to the property. 

As the power project is located on Native American land, the lead permitting 
agency under the National

Environmental Policy Act is the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). 
Additionally, BIA approval is necessary 

to ensure that the Teayawa Energy Center appropriately meets the cultural, 
environmental and economic 

considerations of the Torres Martinez.

Jean, per our conversation today, please add Netscape to the following users 
PC's.  The application is required to run the "Deal Analysis" program 
recently completed by Dave Foti.  This program was written to help the 
marketing team analyze the profitability of new transport deals and the fuel 
consumed on the proposed pipeline path.  I understand we will lose the 
Netscape capability in approx. 3 months with the advent of Windows 2000.

thanks for the help

Gas Storage--The Final Push

injections
of 62 Bcf during the week ending October 6 precipitated a $0.37 increase in=

prices, but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of=

However, normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in=20

from last year=01,s level and would require added storage withdrawals, whic=

Regional Markets-Winter Rules

The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way, and the start =
of=20
winter
heating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supply-ri=
ch
Rocky Mountains and the Henry Hub. Local demand for Rockies supply has also
eased pressure on San Juan Basin prices, and CERA expects differentials=20
between
both regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November. In t=
he
Northeast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter, with =
the
magnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather. The onset=
=20
of flows
on Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe=
r=20
(see
Table 3).

CERA=01,=01,s outlook by region follows:

* Rockies. Early-season cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry
Hub differentials so far this month. Ample supplies within the
Rockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the
end of October and early November depending on heating load,
but in general strong regional demand will keep differentials
well below the ($1.00) per MMBtu summer level. CERA
expects a ($0.45) per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub
during November.

* San Juan. The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies
will continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting
flows south out of the Rockies. San Juan differentials should
follow the same relationships as Rockies prices, with general
narrowing but continued volatility through November. CERA
expects an average San Juan differential of ($0.38) per MMBtu
for November.

* Permian and Mid-Continent. Tight relationships between the
Permian Basin and Mid-Continent and the Henry Hub should
continue through November, with some slight widening in the
Mid-Continent basis differential expected when Alliance flows
commence. CERA expects differentials of ($0.11) per MMBtu
and ($0.08) per MMBtu, respectively.

* Chicago. The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline
during November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago
citygate market. However, the demand rebound that would
result from normal November weather this year would offset
most of the added supplies. As a result, Chicago differentials
will average in the $0.08-$0.20 per MMBtu range even when
Alliance flows commence, although delay of the Vector
Pipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest. CERA
expects average November Chicago differentials of $0.13 per
MMBtu.

* Northeast markets. Normal weather would drive a substantial
rebound in New York citygate prices from year-earlier levels,
but there is little added delivery capacity into that market.
CERA expects New York to price $0.66 above the Henry Hub
during November, well above the current low o mid-$0.30s.

Canadian Markets--Supply Growth Still Uncertain
The supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are=20
uncertain. A
line pack of between 5 and 6 Bcf has been established, and modest flows of=
=20
200-300
million cubic feet (MMcf) per day have been initiated to test and commissio=
n=20
the
pipeline. The start-up is still slated for November 1, but the unknown=20
quantities of
gas that are flowing on a day-to-day basis are making it difficult to asses=
s=20
precisely
the volume of supply being produced. At this time, it appears that October =
is=20
on par
with 1999. The current expectation is for over 15,500 well completions in=
=20
2000,
approximately 8,500 of which are expected to be gas wells. Even if the=20
shallow trend
does not change substantially, the sheer number of wells is still expected =
to=20
produce
a supply build by year-end and into 2001. For 2000, the total western suppl=
y=20
build is
expected to be flat with 1999 to slightly negative, increasing to positive=
=20
growth of
350 MMcf per day in 2001.

Demand Slow but Exports Up
TransCanada flows are still down, averaging about 350 MMcf per day less in
October than the year-earlier levels. Storage injections in the East have=
=20
accelerated;
eastern inventories are expected to be above last year=01,s levels at the e=
nd of=20
October.
Storage injections in the West, however, have dwindled, revising the expect=
ed
storage inventories to be even with the five-year average but below 1999=20
levels.
PG&E GT-NW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly
below 1999 levels by 50-100 MMcf per day in November as well. Northern Bord=
er
Pipeline is running about 50 MMcf per day above October 1999 but is expecte=
d=20
to be
slightly below 1999 levels in November. Cooler-than-normal weather has push=
ed
western Canadian demand up slightly but does not offset the lower eastern=

Canadian
demand.

High Prices, Wide Differentials
The AECO-Henry differential has leveled off in the upper US$0.50s to low
US$0.60s and is expected to remain in that range through the balance of=20
October.
For November the differential is expected to average US$0.50, for a resulti=

AECO
average of C$6.97 per gigajoule (US$5.00 per MMBtu).

Title: Temporary Slack

*********************************************************

Warm weather and strong storage injections have temporarily shifted the foc=
us=20
in the
gas market away from a potential supply shortage this winter toward a growi=
ng=20
sense
that supplies might just prove adequate. The result has been a steady and=
=20
steep
decline in the November NYMEX price from $5.63 per MMBtu on October 12 into
the $4.60s as of October 25. Cash prices have followed suit, falling from t=
he=20
mid-
$5.50s to the $4.60s at the Henry Hub, and gas is now pricing below residua=
l=20
fuel oil
in the Gulf Coast and especially on the East Coast. Although gas storage=20
inventories
will begin the winter at levels higher than expected, in CERA=01,s view ade=
quate
supply for the winter is not yet assured, and the market remains subject to=
 a=20
quick
return to prices well above $5.00 with the first cold snap.

Storage injections of 71 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Octobe=
r=20
20
accompanied by broad-based and continuing warm weather have driven the shif=
t=20
in
market psychology. Last week=01,s injection rate was 26.5 Bcf, or approxima=
tely=20
3.8
Bcf per day, above the previous five-year average for those seven days and =
58=20
Bcf
above the 13 Bcf of injections recorded last year for the week ending Octob=
er=20
22.
With warm weather this week and the return of more normal temperatures=20
expected
next week, CERA now expects storage to reach a maximum level of 2,784 Bcf o=
n
October 31--still an all-time low entering the winter, by 26 Bcf (see Table=
=20
1).

Is this inventory level "enough"? Not yet. Storage inventories this winter=
=20
under 15-
year normal weather conditions would fall to approximately 780 Bcf, 22 Bcf=
=20
above
the previous all-time low. This end-of-March minimum implies total=20
withdrawals in
the United States this winter of 2.0 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), 128 Bcf abo=
ve=20
last year=01,s
withdrawals. But holding withdrawals this winter down to 2.0 Tcf in the fac=
e=20
of a
return to normal weather--and the demand rebound of 3.0 Bcf per day it woul=
d
bring--will be difficult. Although the beginning of a US supply rebound and
growing imports will add approximately 1.0 Bcf per day to supplies this=20
winter,
holding withdrawals down requires both of the following:

* Industrial markets--mainly ammonia and methanol
producers--that are now shut down because of high gas prices
must remain shut down. These markets represent
approximately 0.5 Bcf per day of demand that could return,
should gas prices moderate relative to ammonia and methanol.

* The nearly 1.5 Bcf per day of switchable load now burning
residual fuel oil must remain off of gas.

In CERA=01,s view, for gas prices to fall below resid on a sustained basis,=
=20
particularly
as power loads increase this winter, it must become apparent that winter=20
demand can
be met, the current resid load can return to gas, and storage inventories c=
an=20
be held
reasonably near the previous record low. That low, 758 Bcf, occurred in Mar=
ch=20
1996
and was accompanied by a February average price of $4.41 and a March averag=
e=20
of
$3.00 at the Henry Hub. That spring, however, US productive capability was=
=20
nearly
4.0 Bcf per day greater than it is today, winter power generation demand wa=
s=20
lower,
and there were about 4.5 million fewer residential and commercial gas=20
customers in
the United States.

Market fundamentals in CERA=01,s view still support gas prices above those =
of=20
resid,
which as of this writing is pricing in the $4.75-$5.00 per MMBtu range. War=
m
weather throughout November and into December could reverse this=20
relationship, but
a warm October alone is insufficient, and any cold weather within the next =
few
weeks will quickly tighten the slack that has temporarily come into the=20
market.
CERA=01,s price outlook for November--an average of $5.50 at the Henry Hub-=
-
stands for now.

Lorrian and Michel,

The Rofr option, which grants the shipper the right to lock in the 
transportation rate (max rate) for next
a few years, is priced as a spread swaption. 

I priced two scenarios for you:  the strip starts 1) Nov.1-00 and 2)Nov. 1-01.
For the first one I assume that the shipper makes decision on Oct. 31,00 (54 
days  to maturity)
and  on Oct. 31,01(419 days to maturity)  for the second case.

The second case has longer time to expiration, therefore larger option time 
value. See the attached
spreadsheets for more detail.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Zimin

Kim,

You might want to get on the distribution of this report.  I have wondered 
and asked the question "Do we always cover variable operating costs on our 
park and ride deals"?  A ride can have a very negative impact on fuel use.  
Doesn't the Deal Analysis cover park & ride deals?  You might want to check 
into this.

Thanks........Terry

Operations is digging out 2000 feet of pipe to begin the hydro test today or 
thursday.  If the test results are good, they'll recoat the pipe and put it 
back in service.  We could be at 80% volume on Friday afternoon, but this is 
tentative.  

Also, the smart pig test run several months ago identified 4 potential areas 
that need inspections west of station 5.  While east of thoreau is down, 
these 4 areas will also be inspected.

Do not pass this info onto customers at this point till we have further 
information.  We will make a posting hopefully this afternoon.  Operations is 
also trying to combine some additional compressor work to this outage (i.e. 
grouting another unit and replacing some valves).  This work will limit our 
west deliveries to 875,000.  This notice will also be posted shortly.

see me if you have questions

Is available only through Friday, Oct. 27
Is located at: survey.enron.com


Top 10 Reasons You Should Fill Out The Pulse Survey:
10. This is one time silence isn't golden.
9. Those pesky flashing red lights are trained to come back on until you fill 
it out.
8. 50% response rate.  3 days left to go.  You do the math.
7. Despite what you may think, the survey results don't just go spinning into 
cyberspace.  There are action teams in operation all around Enron whose sole 
mission is to resolve problems that are identified in the survey feedback.
6. It's free!  (And very easy, too.)
5. You have a right to remain silent.  But if you give up that right, we may 
be able to help you.
4. For the 15 minutes you're filling it out, you don't have to work!
3. You can say what you really feel about your job and Enron without fear, 
because the survey is completely confidential.
2. Do you really want that other business unit one-upping you in 
participation numbers?
And the number one reason you (yes, you) should fill out The Pulse:
1. We're going to keep sending these emails until we have 100% participation.

FROM: Enron Human Resources


We are pleased to pass along to you the fact that United HealthCare (UHC) and 
Memorial Herman Health Systems (MHHS) reached agreement on a long-term 
contract.   There will be no disruption in terms of accessing network 
services from the hospital system or those providers who were scheduled to be 
terminated.  Employees currently electing UHC will receive a confirming 
letter shortly from UHC.

As mentioned in our earlier memo, it is our understanding that Cigna has also 
been contacted by MHHS and are now in contract negotiations. 

Open Enrollment packages are in the mail and you should consider the above 
facts when making your decision on your medical election.

Houston folks may want to schedule their own time to listen.  This call was 
very good for information and will be continued monthly throughout the winter.

In a November 17, 2000, CERA multimedia conference call and web presentation, 
Ed Kelly, CERA Director, and 
Bryan Sanderson, CERA Associate, discuss: 

WINTER WEATHER SCENARIOS: BRACING FOR THE STORM 
* Demand potential under cold, normal, and warm weather 
conditions this winter. A return to normal weather will 
push demand well above last year's levels. 
* Storage outlook. How low can it go? 
* Price. Limited demand flexibility and low storage 
levels will continue to drive prices through the winter.

 Today we reached another milestone on Transwestern for total volumes flowing 
West and down the San Juan Lateral. Our volumes on the lateral were a record 
878,000 dth/d and flowing West were a record !,065,000 dth/d.

 This tremendous accomplishment is due to several factors including the 
success of the TW Commercial Team in fully subscribing all capacity including 
Daily Firm and LFT (there is no more space!).  In addition, the significant 
effort put forth by Market Services, Gas Control, Facility Planning and 
Operations to identify all capacity and make it flow should be recognized. 
Thanks for a job well done and supporting the team effort! 

  Steve

We recently asked you to create an eSpeak "wish list" for us.  The response 
was tremendous and, in some cases, very creative.  Your fellow employees 
asked for everyone from Britney Spears to George Bush.  In all, we received 
requests for 61persons outside of Enron to host an eSpeak event.  We thought 
you might like to know who your colleagues find interesting, so we've 
provided a sampling of the suggestions below.  Here are the top ten most 
requested eSpeakers.

10.  Jack Welch, CEO, General Motors 
9.  Scott McNeally, CEO, Sun Microsystems 
8.  Satisfied Enron Customers
7.  Stephen Covey, author, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People
6.  Oprah Winfrey, talkshow host
5.  General Colin Powell, former Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S.A. 
4.  Alan Greenspan, Chairman, Federal Reserve, U.S.A.
3.  Former U.S. President George Bush 
2.  Bill Gates, CEO, Microsoft 
1.  Texas Governor George W. Bush

While we can't make any promises, we will do our best to bring in at least 
some of these special guests.  If you have any contacts who could help us get 
in touch with these guest speakers, please let us know at ethink@enron.com.  
Everybody needs a little help now and then, even eSpeak.

There were plenty of internal speakers requested, as well.  Those requests 
should be somewhat easier to meet, although scheduling time with some of our 
colleagues can be quite a task!

Thank you all for your participation.

Steve / Julia, if this is OK, will you please forward to all Market Services 
members.
thanks
KH


Pursuant to our conversation today, we will implement the following change in 
the way Market Services allocates the California delivery points:

Historically we have allocated the border as an area.  Effective 9/18/00 
until further notice, we will allocate the border by individual points.

If SoCal windows TW down to a number less than the standard 750,000 MMBtu/d, 
then we will allocate shipper noms down to the window total.
PGE and Mojave points will be individually allocated to their capacities as 
well.

If the opportunity arises whereby gas allocated at Needles can be moved to 
Topock or Mojave, then Market Services should work with the Shippers to 
accommodate their needs.

The West of Thoreau area should not exceed the 1,090,000 MMBtu/d capacity 
constraint.

Any questions can be directed to Steve January, TK Lohman, or Darrell 
Schoolcraft.

It seems to me that if the capacity is only for the months of Nov-Mar, the 
reference to the discounted rate in section 2 should state that it is for the 
period Nov-Mar through 2010.  Also, the language in paragraph 6 should 
eliminate the reference to the tariff, since we don't have it, just start 
with the phrase "Shipper agrees that if it utilizes -----

Dth/d of seasonal (November through March) capacity effective November 1, 
2000.  The transport rate of $.15/Dth/d shall increase annually by

(EOT) Area  to the SWG Interconnect located in the East of California Area.  
Alternate receipt point rights shall be from Tranwestern's EOT Area and from 
the Bloomfield Compressor.   SWG ROFR rights shall be wiaved. In 
additionTranswestern shall propose  to retain revenues generated by capacity 
release at rates higher than the effective contract's discount rate.

and gas, and therefore, rejected the more robust reforms outlined in the=20

The good news is that, with respect to Hector Road, the maximum volume at=

excerpt at at page 50 regarding Hector Road:

(1) Receipt Points/ Intrastate Transmission
As we have already discussed above, we now judge that intrastate transmissi=
on=20
unbundling is not wise at this time for the SoCalGas system.  However,=20
SoCalGas=01, intrastate transmission system can still be made more accessib=
le=20
and understandable to its users.
In R. 98-01-011, the record reflects dissatisfaction among customers and=20
shippers with the lack of clarity on how SoCalGas schedules gas shipments=
=20
through its windowing system, and SoCalGas=01, sole use of the Hector Road=
=20
interconnection as a receipt point. (Exh. 8 in R. 98-01-011, pp. 29-31=20
(Southern California Edison Company Market Conditions Report), (Panel Heari=
ng=20
Testimony of  Mr. Paul Carpenter, Southern California Edison, Tr. pp.=20
931-932, Jan 25, 1999).) Our decision in D. 99-07-015 directed investigatio=
n=20
into using the Hector Road interconnection, even on an interim basis, and t=
he=20
publication of SoCalGas=01, windowing criteria in tariffs.  SoCalGas filed=
=20
Advice Letter 2837, which detailed its process of basing a maximum amount o=
f=20
gas scheduled for shipment through a receipt point on the prior day=01,s=20
nominations, except at the first of the month.  Early in the instant=20
proceeding, the ALJ held in abeyance active consideration of the windowing=
=20
procedure tariff SoCalGas filed, pending the resolution we reach today. =20
(Prehearing Conference of September 1, 1999, p. 34.)
We are approving on an interim basis the replacement of the current windowi=
ng=20
process with a system under which SoCalGas will establish receipt point=20
capacities, subject to daily revision, on the basis of the physical maximum=
s=20
for each receipt point under the operating conditions expected for that day=
. =20
Customers and shippers will know the daily maximums because they will be=20
posted on SoCalGas=01, GasSelect system daily prior to the nomination=20
deadlines.  If, in the aggregate, customers nominate more than the physical=
=20
capacity at any receipt point, gas will be scheduled based on the upstream=
=20
pipeline=01,s capacity rights system.  For Wheeler Ridge, at which more tha=
n one=20
upstream pipeline delivers gas, the maximum daily physical capacity would b=
e=20
allocated between upstream sources pro rata on the basis of the prior day=
=01,s=20
scheduled deliveries from each source.
This system eliminates the mystery in how pro-rations are made, provides=20
continuity in capacity rights between the interstate and intrastate systems=
=20
and provides flexibility for customers in nominating at the most=20
cost-effective receipt point on any given day.  We recognize that it does n=
ot=20
provide for long-term planning, but the alternative under the CS of paid-fo=
r=20
firm receipt point rights for the term of the settlement has the disadvanta=
ge=20
of locking customers into a receipt point that may lose value over the term=
. =20
In this period of gas price volatility, we believe that the more flexible=
=20
plan is the right one.
Thus, we direct SoCalGas to withdraw Advice Letter 2837 and file a new advi=
ce=20
letter within 10 business days implementing the proposed receipt point=20
physical capacity system.  This may be the same as the exemplary tariff fil=
ed=20
with the IS or updated as necessary pursuant to subsequent proceedings.  Th=
is=20
tariff revision will be effective within 30 days after the filing unless=20
rejected by the Energy Division.
In R.98-01-011, PG&E and Edison particularly complained about the=20
restrictions at Wheeler Ridge. (Exh. 15 in R. 98-01-11, pp. 7-9 (PG&E=20
Rebuttal to Market Conditions Report), and Exh.8 in R. 98-01-011, pp. 29-31=
,=20
(Southern California Edison, Market Conditions Report).) One response in th=
e=20
IS to these complaints is the establishment of a formal receipt point at=20
Hector Road for all customers, subject to Wheeler Ridge access fees and=20
surcharges.  Its capacity will be 50 MMcfd or greater as long as there are=
=20
nominations of that volume and Mojave Pipeline Company delivers that much i=
n=20
response to those nominations.  This provision should allow greater=20
flexibility for shippers and customers as well as leveling the playing fiel=
d=20
between SoCalGas and others at this interconnection.  We will support=20
SoCalGas=01, application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for=20
approval of Hector Road as a formal delivery point by Mojave.
El Paso Natural Gas Company objected strongly to the provision in the IS fo=
r=20
automatically expanding of Wheeler Ridge capacity  While this was not an=20
option specifically mentioned in D.99-07-015, we do not choose to stand on=
=20
that technicality to exclude it from consideration here.  Once a proceeding=
=20
is open to settlement, the dynamics of settlement talks may bring in matter=
s=20
outside the delineated scope, as they have done here with regard to Wheeler=
=20
Ridge expansion and, for instance, pooling.  Both proposals respond to=20
concerns raised in R.98-01-011, (see citations in text above as well as Pan=
el=20
Hearing Testimony of Mr. Benjamin C. Campbell, PG&E, Tr. pp. 267-268, Jan 1=
9,=20
1999)) and neither was specifically excluded from further consideration in=
=20
D.99-07-015.  We therefore view them as within the scope of this proceeding=
. =20
To the extent that other receipt points are also viewed as constrained, we=
=20
welcome evidence to that effect in a future proceeding, as well as proposal=
s=20
for criteria to determine when expansion should be applied for.  by 100MMcf=
d=20
if a certain number of curtailments occurred, and for automatically allowin=
g=20
the expenses of that expansion to be rolled into rates.  We do not wish to=
=20
approve automatic rate increases for all ratepayers for a facility for whic=
h=20
only some may have use, but we believe that developing criteria for expansi=
on=20
of receipt points is useful.  Hector Road may not entirely alleviate the=20
problem of constraints on northern gas flowing to the south.
Therefore, we approve that portion of Section III of the IS that sets forth=
=20
criteria for expansion, but provide that upon the meeting of that criteria,=
=20
SoCalGas shall submit an application for an expansion of the receipt point=
=20
capacity.  That application shall be processed in the regular way, with the=
=20
issues of need in the context of the entire system and foreseeable market=
=20
conditions considered.  Moreover,  rolled-in or incremental rates, allocati=
on=20
of cost among classes and consequent rate design will remain open for=20
decision in that proceeding.
Thus, the modification to the IS that we make is in the first sentence of t=
he=20

of the paragraph, and the concomitant language in Appendix A setting the co=

very good news, though, is that  TW's proposal was included in both=20

We will of course express out extreme dissappointment with the PD, and poin=

out that this decision condemns California to a 20th century infrastructure=

when the state's 21st century economy demands much, much better. =20

We should discuss.  Since the PD empowers the likes of Norm and Florio, it=

will be important to play very close attention to implementation of Hector.

Sorry to have to be the one to deliver the news.   But we have a knack of=

whatever turns up at the end.

The PD in the Gas Restructuring is out.   I have yet to read the whole
thing, but the title "Approval With Modifications Of The Interim
Settlement..." does not bode well.  According to Steve Watson (and I only
have Steve's statement second hand), the decision reflects a fear that the
timing is wrong in light of the current volatile gas price market.

Regarding the subject interconnect, Bennie Neatherlin/TW Operations reported 
that the facilities have been sold to Duke some time ago.  The only thing 
that exists on TW system for the subject interconnect is a 4" side valve that 
is disconnected from the measuring facilities.  Should your prospective 
producer want to come to TW at this location, we would need to provide you 
with a Level "A" cost estimate for new interconnect facilities to connect to 
the existing 4" side valve.  TW's line pressure at the 4" side valve would be 
near 600-650 psig.  (Should they be interested in going to Duke, their line 
pressure is near 400 psig.)

Would you like for us to provide you with a cost estimate?  If so, what type 
of volumes are proposed and will dehy/production equipment be provided by the 
producer?

GPG will begin gathering information in September for our migration to=20
Windows 2000 and Outlook/Exchange.

Windows 2000 (or W2K) is Microsoft's newest operating system and has been=
=20
selected as Enron's standard desktop operating system.  Along with this=20
change, we are moving from Lotus Notes to Outlook/Exchange as our standard=

This project is a huge undertaking, and we need everyone=01,s assistance to=

include application information gathering, identifying security requirement=
s,=20
documenting all issues and concerns, and communicating project status.

We are approaching the Windows 2000/Exchange Project in a phased approach.

Phase I, starting now and running through November, consists of =01&Informa=
tion=20
Gathering=018 about hardware, applications, issues, as well as application=
=20
testing in our Windows 2000 lab and user sign-off.  The Phase I findings wi=

determine the Phase II start date.

Phase II, will be the actual =01&Implementation=018 of desktop hardware, Wi=
ndows=20
2000 and Outlook software, and user training.  We will also be migrating=20
"user" data on the network to a Windows 2000 file server and migrating=20
applications to a Windows 2000 application server.=20

Some of the benefits of migrating to W2K
Increased desktop reliability and response time.  Windows 2000 is much more=
=20
stable and robust than Windows 95/98/NT.
Increased system performance because minimum hardware requirements for W2K=

(1).  We can no longer accept Co2 levels higher than 2% from the Val Verde 
Plant at Bloomfield.  This gas goes 
directly into PNM's system, and we have no other gas to commingle the 
stream.  The alarm limits have been changed
to 2.0% HH. and 1.8% H.  If there C02 exceeds 2.0% Please call the plant and 
request they cut back.  Please log every
conversation due to quality and volumes.  Names and Times.
This complies with our quality limits in TW's Tarriff for the Blanco Hub.

(2).  On the Ignacio to Blanco piece of pipe, we have different language in 
the Tariff to take the higher Co2 as long as 
it blends before it gets to the Blanco Hub.

Westcoast, Coastal Split Engage Energy Assets

To prepare for El Paso Energy's looming takeover of Coastal Corp., Westcoast 
Energy Inc. and Coastal are splitting up Engage Energy, their three-year-old 
marketing venture, with each retaining a half interest in the Houston-based 
gas marketer. The split should be completed by the end of the week. 

Coastal, headquartered in Houston, will merge with El Paso Energy in a $16 
billion deal by the end of the fourth quarter (see Daily GPI, Jan. 19), and 
company officials said that several transactions needed to be completed 
before the merger could be finalized, including dismantling the Engage 
venture. Vancouver-based Westcoast and Coastal each own 50% interest in 
Engage, which has 12 regional offices throughout North America and employs 
300. One of the top North American gas marketers, it purchases natural gas 
from every producing basin in North America, and trades electricity within 
all NERC regions. Engage estimates it will add another 1 Bcf/d to its natural 
gas deliverability by the end of this year. 

NGI ranked Engage in 12th place in its 1999 North American power marketers 
list, dropping from eighth place in 1998, losing about 15.2% in sales. Engage 
reported a sales volume of 5.6 Bcf/d last year, compared with 6.6 Bcf/d the 
previous year. It sold an estimated 2,100 Bcf of natural gas in 1999. 

Westcoast and Coastal formed Engage in 1997 to offer a full spectrum of 
energy services, including natural gas marketing and trading, electricity 
trading and sales, energy management services, structured storage and 
transportation-related services, structured power and management services and 
energy risk management services. The companies said that those services would 
continue as before. There is expected to be little impact on either company's 
existing asset valuation. 

Under the restructuring plan, Westcoast will retain the Engage Canadian 
business entity and certain natural gas and power activities in the United 
States. Westcoast also will retain the right to use the Engage Energy name 
and will continue to conduct business from Calgary, Southfield, MI and other 
U.S. locations. Coastal will retain the U.S. business entity, with 
headquarters in Houston. 

"By taking full ownership of our natural gas and electricity marketing and 
trading functions, we can better capitalize on the knowledge, experience, 
track record and infrastructure that we have built over the past three 
years," said Michael Phelps, Westcoast CEO. 

When Coastal merges with El Paso, it will be joining a company that already 
has a strong gas marketing arm. NGI ranked El Paso seventh on its list of gas 
marketers in 1999, noting that it traded 6.7 Bcf/d of natural gas last year. 
It also was ranked seventh in 1998.

This is pretty useful reference material and info site...
     
 NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : November 30, 2000

EIA Rolls Out Long List of New Gas-Fired Power 
Between 2000 and 2004, a total of 145,417 MW of nonutility generation is 
expected to be added to the U.S. power grid and 83% of that total will be 
gas-fired power generation, according to a new survey by the Energy 
Information Administration. 

The EIA's Inventory of Nonutility Electric Power Plants in the United States 
find that a total of 799 new gas-fired units, totaling 120,645 MW in 
nameplate capacity, are scheduled to be added by the end of 2004.  The 
Southeastern Electric Reliability Council is expected to receive the largest 
portion of new nonutility generation with an additional 252 units totaling 
36,636 MW.  SERC is followed by ERCOT with 109 new units totaling 21,775 MW, 
ECAR with an expected 181 additional units totaling 17,733 MW and MAIN with 
140 new units totaling 17,139 MW. 

The largest amount of new nonutility capacity, or about 61,823 MW, is 
expected to be added in 2002.  About 46,551 MW of new capacity is scheduled 
to be in service next year. 

Electric restructuring has led to a boom in nonutility power generation.  The 
EIA report found that total nonutility generation in 1999 reached 167,357 MW, 
which was a 71% increase from the previous year.  However, only 21% of the 
total represented new plants.  In 1999, about 50,000 MW of electric utility 
generation assets were purchased by nonutility generation companies.  At the 
end of 1999, nonutility generation accounted for 19.8% of total electric 
generation in the country.  The totals reported by EIA include all operable 
units, even those that did not run at all in 1999 but are expected to return 
to service. 

Gas-fired power accounted for the largest share of nonutility generation last 
year, and the Pacific Census Division accounted for 31.4% of that gas-fired 
capacity. The Pacific Census Division also accounted for the greatest number 
(1,167) of total nonutility generation and the most nonutility capacity 
(33,254 MW). California was the dominant state in the division with 30,189 
MW. 

Gas-fired (only) generation represented 29.4% (49,353 MW) of total nonutility 
capacity in 1999, and petroleum/natural gas (fuel switchable/combined) 
generation accounted for 24.2% (40,508 MW) of the total. Coal represented 
28.9% (48,501 MW).  Hydroelectric power accounted for 3.6%. Petroleum (only) 
totaled 2.2% and all other sources amounted to 11.5% of total nonutility 
generation. 

The top five states based on existing nameplate capacity are California 
(30,189 MW), Illinois (24,013 MW), New York (17,256 MW), Pennsylvania (12,483 
MW) and Texas (12,376 MW).

Aquila Signs Long-Term Deal with APEA

Aquila Energy said it has been awarded a $550 million long-term contract to 
supply 154 Bcf of natural gas over 12 years to members of the American Public 
Energy Agency (APEA). It is the fourth contract the agency has awarded to 
Aquila since 1998. 

"With the future of gas prices becoming more and more unknown because of 
increasing demands and tightening supply, our members will benefit greatly 
from this long-term contract," said Roger Mock, president and chief executive 
officer of APEA. 

Under the three previous contracts with APEA Aquila is supplying the agency 
with 14.4 Bcf of gas over ten years, 91 Bcf over 12 years and 141 Bcf over 12 
years. All together, Aquila is providing APEA with more than 400 Bcf over the 
next 12 years. 

APEA provides a reliable supply of natural gas to many municipal utilities 
and other public entities throughout the United States. These public buyers 
serve thousands of homes and businesses. 

"Our strategy is to provide our customers with the most effective portfolio 
of services, both financially and physically, to enhance their competitive 
position in managing their energy needs," said Tom McCarthy, vice president 
of structured transactions for Aquila Energy.

I do not see any problems with the draft tariff sheets. My concerns are how 
to implement this new service. We need to start meeting with 
marketing/legal/regulatory to determine how we will implement this & define 
the system requirements. Here are some of my questions:

If we recall & the nomination is still in place, then how do we allocate? 
What are the allocation rules?
How do we track the volumes/contracts that have been recalled? Who will 
monitor this process? What type of process is needed to track recalls & 
transporter call volumes?
What is the timing for the recall notice? Can it occur after the gas day has 
started? Will we have partial day recalls?
Will the recall option & transporter put option carry over to the aquiring 
shipper? What system changes are needed for capacity release?
How do we require a shipper to take firm transport capacity? Will this have 
some type of OFO notice similar to EFBH that requires the shipper to nominate?
How will the invoice system be changed to handle the various option fee 
processes? Will we store this information at a contract level in CBS or in 
the rate system at a contract level? Who will load & monitor these fee 
options?
Do we need a new Rate Schedule?

Lindy, can you let me know when you are availble to start meeting on this new 
service so that I can create our system requirements document. I am availble 
July 24th, 25th, & 26th.

Please let me know.

Thanks Ramona

Everyday heroes are all around us at Enron, living our core values of 
Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence in everything they do.  Some 
of these heroes make a big splash while others just quietly make a difference 
in the workplace around them.  Either way, these special individuals deserve 
to be recognized with a nomination for the 2000 Chairman's Award.

As there is more than just one employee living the values at Enron, this 
award program will honor 10 employees as members of the Chairman's 
Roundtable.  From that group, the one individual most embodying our values 
will be presented with the Chairman's Award at the Management Conference in 
San Antonio in November.

The beauty of this award program is that it is completely employee-driven 
from beginning to end.  From your nominations, an international employee 
committee will select the Chairman's Roundtable and eventually, the 
Chairman's Award winner.  Your role of nominating our everyday heroes is 
extremely vital to the program's success.  If someone has made a positive 
impression on you, please take the time to complete a nomination form and 
send it to Charla Reese by October 1, 2000.  You may click here for a 
printable form:  http://home.enron.com/announce/chairman_nom/form3.doc

For more information on the Chairman's Award, including details on last 
year's Roundtable members and previous winners, Repit Suliyono and Bobbye 
Brown, please click here: http://home.enron.com/announce/chairman_nom

Again, this is a very special award at Enron and we sincerely thank you for 
your participation.

Ken, Jeff and Joe

In approximately one month (9/9/2000), we are targeting that a new version of 
the Oracle NT client (8.1.6), Borland Database Engine (BDE) 5.1.1 and 
Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) 2.5. to all Corp/ENA workstations. 
This software provides the connectivity from your workstation to Enron's 
Oracle databases and the applications supported by them.  We are currently in 
the process of testing all the applications managed by Corp/ENA Information 
Technology to ensure that they will be compliant with this new software.

This change may also effect your own developed MS-Access, MS-Excel 
spreadsheets, and/or MS-Query documents that retrieve data from Enron's 
Oracle databases via ODBC drivers. As part of the upgrade, all Oracle ODBC 
connections will be upgraded to compliant driver versions. 

If you would like to test your MS-Access databases and/or MS-Excel 
spreadsheets under the new software releases, please use one of the 
workstations at one of the following locations for your testing:

General users
EB2230D
EB2778B
EB0504P
EB4857

Traders and developers only please
EB2904E

You may contact your floor support representative for any testing assistance.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the 
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot 
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking 
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of 
complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it 
they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF 
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money 
raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise 
$225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team 
leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the 
walk this year is "Knock Out Diabetes" and we would like to have you join us 
for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron 
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if 
you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee 
members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please 
contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included 
in the first important and informative training session taking place this 
week.

Thank you very much for your support.

The use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past fe=
w=20
years.  As a result the Accounts Payable department has seen a rapid increa=
se=20
in the number of invoices and vendors.  With the higher volume, we have=20
reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle.

Although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual=20
employees, they often mail invoices directly to Accounts Payable.  At times=
=20
they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone.  In thes=
e=20
cases we return the invoice to the vendor.  If the employee is designated, =
we=20
try to track him/her down and forward the invoice.  The high level of=20
employee movement among jobs and locations at Enron has made this=20
increasingly challenging.  Either way, we end up doing something less=20
productive than paying invoices.

To maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessa=
ry=20
for research, we request that employees who have pagers, cell phones, and=
=20
other individually billed items such as licenses, subscriptions, etc., pay=
=20
for them by personal check or charge card (if applicable=01*payment instruc=
tions=20
are usually indicated on the invoice) and request reimbursement through=20
employee expense reports.=20

By submitting these charges on your expense report, you can help us reduce=
=20
the amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoices, the number of=
=20
checks generated by Treasury, the number of vendors in our database, and th=
e=20
turnaround time for payment of invoices. =20

Incidentally, Accounts Payable is currently installing a corporate-wide=20
web-based expense reporting system similar to what Enron International has=
=20
used for the past year.  This will make it even easier to file your expense=
=20
report and receive quick reimbursement.

We=01,d like to make this effective immediately.  If you have any questions=
 or=20
suggestions, please contact the Accounts Payable department.

Kern River discovered a mechanical problem with an oil seal at the Fillmore 
Compressor Station in Utah. Fillmore will be inoperable while repairs are 
made Nov. 30, but no impact to firm capacity is expected. However, 
interruptible capacity will be reduced as necessary for the Nov. 28-29 gas 
days and will not be available Nov. 30.

Northwest noted that despite putting its system into entitlement and issuing 
a realignment OFO, primary scheduled volumes through Kemmerer (WY) Station 
remain greater than physical capacity. Therefore, starting today the pipeline 
is invoking a "must-flow OFO" provision of its tariff. Until further notice, 
shippers with primary corridor rights southbound through Kemmerer are 
required to flow up to 10% of their contract demand from receipt points north 
of Kemmerer to delivery points south of Kemmerer or take some other mutually 
agreeable action to alleviate the Kemmerer capacity problem. See the 
Northwest bulletin board for details.

Subject: White Elephant Christmas Luncheon


OK Gang, we will be having the 2nd Annual White Elephant Christmas Luncheon 
again this year, on Monday December 18th  at 11:30.  To be included in this 
exciting game of chance, you are required to bring a covered dish and a 
wrapped gift of $10.00 or less.  These gifts can be gifts of use, or gag 
gift.  The same rules will apply this year as last, and that is, you can only 
trade your gift twice and your out of the game.  

Julia is kind enough to provide the honey glazed ham, plates, dinner ware and 
ice tea, which we will have in EB4102. Please bring a covered dish, hours d' 
oeuvres or a dessert (keep in mind, we could have a lot of people attend).  
She is also extending her invitation to the other departments on this floor, 
in hopes they would like to participate.

Julie, Candace and Audrey, could you please forward this on to your groups 
within the 41st floor.

See ya there!!!!!!!!
Ricki

Take a look at the California send out numbers for 11/15 and 11/16.  We're 
really pushing the envelope here.  Collectively, SoCal and PG&E are having to 
withdraw over 2 Bcf/d in order to meet demand.  This situation is precisely 
what we've predicted would happen in a gas short marketplace.  Look for this 
shortage to be exacerbated in the next few years with the addition of the new 
EOC power plants, particularly, when the power is most likely going to be 
used to serve native markets, not the Cal. ISO/PX with its "price cap" 
feature.

According to Jeff Dasovich, the CEO of Sempra has referred to the project 
publicly as a "bypass pipeline."  The pipe will drop down through Imperial 
Irrigation, follow the border on the Mexico side, go through Mexicali and 
serve the new Sempra LDC there, go back across the border to south of San 
Diego to the PG&E's Otay Mesa IPP, then proceed on to Rosarita.

As we discussed, the "genie is out of the bottle" with respect to all future 
bypass projects in California.  The only significant opposition that could be 
mounted here is the CPUC and/or other customer groups like TURN or ORA 
bemoaning the project's "cherrypicking" of gas loads.

Once again, I am sending you the pdf file for the latest and greatest news 
about the SAP implementation.  We found out the computer I used this time had 
a different version of Acrobat so try this one.   Double click on the 
attached and launch in Acrobat reader.  If the error message that no 
application is found, click your START button,  click on Programs and then 
Utilities which should bring up Acrobat Reader at the top.  Click on that and 
load the application. 

If you have problems or, if you really would like a different version, let me 
know.  Just respond to this note or call me at 713-853-3986.  If you prefer a 
printed copy or a non-graphic version, let me know that too.

Michelle Lokay,

Good morning!  Before bid weeks gets cranked up next week, I wanted to remind 
you to register for the upcoming Sports Tournament.  It's only a few weeks 
away, and as additional incentive to do so, Chairman Bobby Norris has decided 
to hold a special drawing for members who have registered AND paid by October 
2.  A door prize worth approximately $500 will be awarded to some lucky early 
registrant, so get your form in today!  Have a good weekend and we'll look 
for you on the 16th.

Subject: Long term Basis quotes

As part of our ongoing effort to analyze Rocky Mnt. opportunities, I've 
secured the following (mid-market) basis quotes from Sempra Trading:

Term  1-year  5-year  10-year

Cal. Brdr. + 0.280  + 0.250  + 0.240

Permian - 0.130  - 0.1175  - 0.110

San Juan - 0.335  - 0.245  - 0.220

Rockies * - 0.480  - 0.420  - 0.380

* Rockies quoted from NWPL at Opal.  CIG North typically trades $0.04 - 0.06 
back from these figures.

The memo distributed on June 27 on Reimbursement of Individually Billed Items 
requires
clarification.  The intent of the memo was to give employees an alternate 
method
of paying for pagers, cell phones, etc.  Employees can continue to submit 
these
invoices to Accounts Payable for processing or  pay these items with their 
corporate
American Express card and request reimbursement through an expense report.  
Either
way is an acceptable way to process these small dollar high volume invoices.

FERC Gives High Sign to WI Pipe Competition

      The northern Illinois and southeastern Wisconsin gas transportation 
markets, which long have been dominated by
      ANR Pipeline, moved one step closer to obtaining pipeline-on-pipeline 
competition yesterday when FERC awarded
      the proposed Guardian Pipeline LLC a favorable preliminary 
determination on non-environmental issues. 

      The decision was a major win for the proposed greenfield pipeline 
because not only did it shoot down most of the
      arguments presented by ANR to thwart the project, but it found that 
even though the project would "adversely
      affect" landowner interests, Guardian was making "reasonable efforts" 
to mitigate the impact on landowners. 

      Moreover, FERC ruled that while the $224 million pipeline would compete 
head-to-head with ANR, it would not
      have a negative affect on the Coastal pipeline and its customers. "On 
balance, the Commission finds that the
      proposed Guardian pipeline will provide substantial public benefits 
with minimal adverse impacts," the order said
      [CP00-36]. 

      The Commission also found that sufficient need was established for the 
36-inch, 140-mile pipeline that would
      transport 750,000 Dth/d of gas from the Chicago Hub to markets in 
northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin,
      providing customers there with an alternative to ANR and access to 
competitive Canadian gas supplies. It would
      terminate near Ixonia, WI, where it would interconnect with Wisconsin 
Gas Co.'s distribution system. At the
      Chicago Hub, the pipeline proposes to interconnect to Alliance 
Pipeline, Northern Border Pipeline, Midwestern Gas
      Pipeline and Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America. 

      Guardian has executed 10-year precedent agreements with four shippers 
for 702,500 Dth/d, which equals about
      94% of the project's design capacity. The largest shipper by far will 
be Wisconsin Gas, which has committed itself
      to 650,000 Dth/d of the capacity on the proposed line. In fact, the 
Guardian project is an outgrowth of Wisconsin
      Gas's request for proposals (RFP) process in June 1998, which the LDC 
initiated in anticipation of the expiration of
      its firm transportation contract with ANR in October 2003. The other 
shippers on Guardian include Alliant Energy
      (10,000 Dth/d), WPS Energy Services Inc. (2,500 Dth/d) and an unnamed 
shipper (40,000 Dth/d). The project has a
      targeted in-service date of Nov. 1, 2002. 

      In multiple protests filed at the Commission, ANR argued that 
Guardian's application was "patently deficient"
      because it didn't include the proposed lateral that Wisconsin Gas plans 
to build to interconnect with Guardian.
      Wisconsin Gas currently is seeking the approval of state regulators to 
build the lateral. Furthermore, ANR claimed
      Wisconsin Gas was using its monopoly power as a franchised LDC serving 
southern Wisconsin to subsidize the
      Guardian project. Wisconsin Gas's parent, WICOR Inc., is one of the 
sponsors of Guardian. The other backers are
      CMS Gas Transmission and Storage and Viking Gas Transmission. 

      But FERC rejected both arguments. "While previous attempts to inject 
competition into ANR's market in this area
      have failed, we believe that this area is ripe for competition, and 
that it is only a matter of time before other
      pipelines submit similar proposals to the Commission. We find that the 
proposed project will provide southeastern
      Wisconsin with access to another source of supply, which will allow 
this market to enjoy the benefits of
      pipeline-to-pipeline competition for the first time," the order noted.

Subject: San Juan Efficiencies

All of the studies results to date show the up and down swings of the 
pipeline efficiency.  We have proved that the pipeline can handle 850 MMcf/d 
plus.  However, it has not been tested since the mainline hasn't moved 1090 
MMcf/d yet after Gallup's installation.  Granted it appears that the San Juan 
lateral has some form of irregularity in efficiency along part of the lateral 
and that issue is still under investigation.  Once the lab tests are 
completed we can better determine the next course of action.  Until then we 
still believe that the pipeline is capable of transporting 850 MMcf/d on the 
San Juan lateral at the same time move 1090 MMcf/d to California even though 
the suction pressure to the Gallup station is not as high as it's design.  
Unfortunately we can't test this theory at the worst possible time until next 
summer.  

Several other issues need to be addressed such as the transport of retained 
fuel and increased throughput on the mainline.  Transporting retained fuel is 
highly improbable because Gallup's compressor can only handle a maximum of 
870 MMcf/d at best under good conditions.  EE&CC provided a compressor 
capable of compressing the design volume only with no retained fuel.  
Therefore if we can solve the inlet pressure problem we can compress up  to 
870 which would basically transport the retained fuel.  Until then Gallup can 
only compress as much as possible over the 850 MMcf/d when conditions 
permit.  Increased mainline throughput West of Thoreau based on a higher 
discharge pressure from Gallup is not possible.  Even though the electric 
motor can develop more horsepower than needed, the compressor was designed 
for 850 MMcf/d at 950 psig discharge.  Therefore the unit can not increase 
it's discharge from the design pressure of 950 psig to 970 psig to allow 
increased firm transportation west.

As for the San Juan Lateral pipeline efficiency, we have experienced a powder 
substance in the lateral both times it was pigged.  We don't know the source 
and a good guess is "San Juan Basin".  If that's the case, we need to find a 
way to keep the lateral clean after a good cleaning process has been done.  
What is El Paso doing if they have the same problem?  It's a touchy subject 
to ask them.  If they don't have a problem (or won't admit it) t hen knowing 
we do could be bad for TW.

Even though this was not apart of the main subject, there have been some 
questions regarding if the mainline efficiency has changed (upward) from any 
pigging activities this year.  The only pigging performed was smart pigging 
between Station #4 & #5 for an incroachment issue.  This had no impact on 
efficiencies west to California.  However, Compression Services is actively 
working with Operations to implement recommendations made by Gary Choquette 
(Omaha Facility Planning Team)  for units at Stations 1 & 2 . Once completed 
over the next few weeks, this should improve unit performance and more 
specifically minimize fuel use.  This could have an overall on the system's 
efficiency  but not specifically the pipeline.

New Hurricane Forecast out of CSU

Renowned hurricane soothsayer Dr. William Gray and his team at Colorado State 
University have 
scaled back their forecast for the hurricane season but still expect the 
season to be more active than 
average. Seven rather than eight hurricanes are expected now and only three 
of them are expected 
to be intense rather than the four expected in the group's prior forecast on 
June 7. In round numbers, 
the August forecast is for three named storms, two hurricanes, and one 
intense or major hurricane. 

"Information obtained through July 2000 indicates that the Atlantic hurricane 
season in 2000 is likely 
to be less active than the four recent very busy years of 1995, 1996, 1998 
and 1999. However, total 
activity is expected to exceed the long term average and is anticipated to be 
considerably more 
active than the mean for the recent period of 1970 through 1994. 

"We estimate that the 2000 season will have seven hurricanes (average is 
5.7), 11 named storms 
(average is 9.3), 55 named storm days (average is 47), 30 hurricane days 
(average is 24), three 
intense (category 3-4-5) hurricanes (average is 2.2), six intense hurricane 
days (average is 4.7) and 
a Hurricane Destruction Potential (HDP) of 90 (average is 71). Collectively, 
net tropical cyclone 
activity in year 2000 is expected to be about 130% of the long term average. 

The early August forecast update is in close to Gray's Dec. 8, 1999) and 
April 7 forecasts, but 
somewhat lower than his recent June 7 update. "The forecast has been lowered 
slightly [because] 
June-July global circulation conditions have not progressed quite as 
favorably for hurricane 
enhancement than as we anticipated in our early June forecast," Gray said.

La Nina Dissipates But Effects Linger  

El Nino and La Nina, the terrible twins blamed for destructive weather  
patterns worldwide for the last three or four years, have finally 
dissipated.  However, their impact on the weather will likely continue for 
some time to  come, according to NASA scientists, based on the latest 
satellite data  gathered this month over the Pacific. While Pacific water 
temperatures have  gradually warmed over the past three to four months to 
near normal in the  tropics, the after effects of La Nina are seen in 
persistent below-normal  temperatures in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska.

 Natural Gas Intellingence, Wednesday, December 6, 2000

Transwestern Adds Receipt and Delivery Points
Transwestern Pipeline is going through a growth spurt with eight new 
interconnect projects in service or under way, which will add 300 MMcf/d in 
market area deliveries and 285 MMcf/d in new supply receipts. The new or 
expanded connection points will enhance shipper access to both new supplies 
and markets. 
"There is not a direct relationship between the two [delivery and receipt 
interconnects]," said Jeff Fawcett, a Transwestern representative. "It is 
kind of coincidental in nature that they came at the same time, but we have 
ongoing activities to connect new supply and create additional opportunities 
for gas to both be received into Transwestern as well as be delivered out of 
Transwestern." 
Included in the delivery interconnect projects, Transwestern, an Enron unit, 
recently put 100 MMcf/d into service for new access to markets around Las 
Vegas with completion of the Southwest Gas interconnect located in the West 
of Thoreau area. 
Two other delivery interconnects are expected to be in service during the 
second quarter of 2001. Transwestern will add a 120 MMcf/d delivery 
interconnect with Citizens Arizona Gas for deliveries to the Griffith Energy 
Power Plant and a 90 MMcf/d delivery interconnect to a soon to be completed 
Calpine plant, both located near Kingman in the West of Thoreau area. 
On the supply side, Transwestern recently has added an 80 MMcf/d receipt 
interconnect in the East of Thoreau area with Natural Gas Pipeline Co. The 
company also said that it has hooked up a new wellhead supply interconnect 
with Enron Oil & Gas located in the East of Thoreau area. The addition will 
bump current supply from 20 MMcf/d to more than 35 MMcf/d. 
Transwestern also has three receipt projects scheduled for completion early 
next year. The pipeline said it expects to increase receipt capacity by 100 
MMcf/d at its interconnect with Red Cedar Gathering south of La Plata in the 
San Juan area later this month, and to put a new 50 MMcf/d receipt 
interconnect with Red Cedar Gathering in service by March 2001. The company 
also is planning to complete a new 40 MMcf/d receipt interconnect with El 
Paso Field Services in East of Thoreau which is scheduled to be in service 
January 2001. 
Transwestern Pipeline's system consists of approximately 2,700 miles of 
natural gas pipeline with combined east-west delivery capability of 1.7 
Bcf/day. For further information on transportation with Transwestern Pipeline 
Co., contact Fawcett at 713-853-1521.

Caithness - Confidentiality agreements were sent this week to the project 
developers of the 550Mw Big Sandy project in northwest Arizona.  Work 
continues on developing pipe lateral costs and environmental impact 
statements.

KN Energy - Their current transport contract to the West has a ROFR that 
expires 7/31.  The 20,000 MMBtu/d capacity is split evenly between Topock and 
Needles (KN is not currently flowing anything to Topock) at a rate of 
$.13/MMBtu.  Even with the Topock space, the total capacity could be worth 
something in the low to mid $.20's.  KN would also like to keep the ROFR 
language but this could only occur with a max rate deal for a term of one 
year or longer.  We should have any offer from KN by Monday 7/31.

Operations - we temporarily lost a compressor for approximately 1 hour at 
Station 2 on Thursday.  There was minimal throughput impacted.  An unusual 
"knock" sound has also been coming from one of the units at Station 4.  High 
western flow is taking its toll on equipment.

August Capacity - West demand is expected to be robust for August (higher 
than June) with high temperatures combined with lower hydro-generation 
capacity available from the Northwest (per CERA).

El Paso / Blanco Mis-Measurement - A letter was drafted this week for Stan's 
signature for delivery to El Paso's management.  The letter outlines the 
circumstances and chronology of events leading up to our meeting with El Paso 
in June.  The letter requests a payback of all the gas volume.  Stan has 
opted not attach a copy of the lawsuit filing to the letter. 

Reliant - Extended their Flex Firm (Primary Receipt and Primary Delivery at 
the West Texas Pool) from July to August 2000 for $.03, but increased volumes 
from 10,000 MMBtu/day to 20,000 MMBtu/day. 

ENA / Citizens Utilities - The new Citizens interconnect for the Griffith 
power plant was scheduled to be purged and filled with gas this week.  As 
manager of Citizen's transport agreement, ENA has notified us verbally they 
will request some or all of the 25,000 MMBtu/d of primary delivery capacity 
for that point.  As soon as we receive their request in writing, we will 
discuss strategy with legal and regulatory to evaluate all TW's options.

Duke Atoka-Crawford Proposal - For a $750,000 construction contribution from 
TW, Duke is willing to build out part of their gathering system to unload 
20,000 MMBtu/d off the Atoka lateral and re-deliver gas to TW's Crawford 
lateral.  TW would receive a 5 year FT at a rate of $.05 plus actual fuel.  
Oasis would be the primary delivery point.  This project has the added 
benefit of allowing TW to sell incremental space on the Atoka lateral.  

In addition, Duke is proposing to install additional compression to deliver 
up to 40,000 MMBtu/d of incremental volume to TW off the Zia plant.  In 
exchange, TW would provide a discounted $.035 IT transport rate for a two 
year term.  The Zia gas would flow through a new tap into TW's high pressure 
30" line.   This project has a fuel saving benefit to TW by eliminating one 
stage of compression from the low pressure system.

ONEOK Acquires 56,200 Dth/d From Williams
 
Williams and ONEOK reported yesterday that they have reached a two-year 
agreement in which Williams will provide incremental firm transportation 
service of 56,200 Dth/d to the Oklahoma Natural Gas (ONG) division of ONEOK. 

"We have had a long-standing relationship with ONEOK through our service to 
its Kansas Gas Service division and we look forward to helping ONEOK serve 
its growing energy needs in Oklahoma," said Kim Cocklin, senior vice 
president of Williams Gas Pipeline-SouthCentral (Central and Texas Gas 
systems). 

Service will begin on Nov. 1, and will require Williams to build two new 
meter stations along its existing pipeline system. A spokesman for ONG said 
the gas load from Williams was necessary to serve its steadily growing 
customer base of approximately 800,000 as the company unbundles its services. 
The transportation capacity will be used to serve customers in ONG's Oklahoma 
City and Enid, OK, markets.

High Prices Force Chemicals to Sell Gas, Futures

Chemical companies, forced to shut in operations because of high natural gas 
prices, are nevertheless making money --- by selling gas futures contracts. 

Terra Industries and Mississippi Chemical Corp. became the latest companies 
to announce cutbacks related to current natural gas costs. 

Iowa-based Terra Industries said it had sold off a portion of its December 
natural gas purchases, and shutdown 50% of its Verdigis, OK, ammonia 
facility. The company had previously reported that it would not operate its 
Bytheville, AR, and Beaumont, TX, facilities during the month of December as 
well. 

In a similar maneuver, Mississippi Chemical Corp., a producer of nitrogen, 
phosphorus and potassium-based products in Mississippi, Louisiana and New 
Mexico, reported the sale of all of its natural gas futures contracts from 
January forward, in order to take full advantage of the opportunity uncovered 
by soaring natural gas prices. Mississippi Chemical said it expects to 
realize a pre-tax gain of $16 million in its second fiscal quarter ending 
Dec. 31 from the recently sold contracts. 

The problem lies in the fact that escalating natural gas costs are not being 
mimicked by chemical prices. An overabundance on the market has kept chemical 
prices relatively low, while gas prices, a feedstock for some chemicals, 
continue to climb. The difference in the latest shutdowns is that the 
companies involved have openly announced they have sold their gas contracts 
off because it is more profitable than manufacturing their products, said Ron 
Phillips of The Fertilizer Institute. 

Duke Energy's Ken Nyiri, divisional director of strategic planning and 
research, commented on Mississippi Chemical's transactions, "I guess they 
probably made about a $4/MMBtu margin on the gas, which is significantly more 
than they could make on the ammonia; in fact, they would have lost $30/unit. 
Their ammonia was probably costing them about $205/ton to make (with gas 
bought at $5/MMBtu in November) and the market today is at $205 so basically 
they would break even on their ammonia production costs. By selling the gas 
at around $9/MMBtu they made $4/MMBtu. It was just a question of do they 
convert the gas to ammonia and make nothing on it, or do they sell the gas 
and make $16 million." 

Michael L. Bennett, executive vice president of Terra, said, "The natural gas 
price increase since our December requirements were purchased for Verdigris 
permitted us to sell a portion of those purchases and generate higher gross 
profits than could be realized from selling the products manufactured with 
the natural gas. We will evaluate the economics of bringing Verdigris back to 
full production near the end of December when January's natural gas purchase 
commitments must be made." 

Terra estimates the idled facilities represent 40%, 30%, 77% and 88% of the 
company's North American ammonia, UAN, urea and methanol manufacturing 
capacity, respectively. The production of all four chemicals are heavily 
dependent on natural gas. Phillips said "The latest data we had in October 
was that of the companies that we survey, which is not the entire ammonia 
market, but a good bit of it, we were looking at operating rates of 76%." 

Currently, a total of 4-5 million tons/year of ammonia production capacity is 
out of service out of about 20-21 million tons/year of production capacity. 
"Clearly some of these folks have been selling their gas [rather than 
producing ammonia]," said Nyiri. "It's the prudent thing to do, I think, in 
this marketplace. Buy your ammonia if you can. At $9 gas, that costs you 
$350/ton to make the ammonia, which is $145 more than the current market is 
willing to pay." 

A spokeswoman for Mississippi Chemical said the company held on to its 
December gas contracts, and has been operating at varied levels of capacity 
throughout 2000 (see Daily GPI, June 30). "Depending on what the gas prices 
are, and what our product prices are around the January-February time frame, 
we will make decisions then on our operations rate [capacity]," said Melinda 
Hood, a Mississippi Chemical spokeswoman. 

Charles O. Dunn, CEO of Mississippi Chemical, said, "We remain committed to 
the nitrogen business and our customers, but we also have to take advantage 
of opportunities to optimize cash flow during these challenging times. It is 
our belief that the current unprecedented natural gas prices are unlikely to 
be sustained during the intermediate term," stated Dunn. "As a result, we 
felt it was in the company's best interest to sell our futures positions to 
lock in the substantial gain afforded by the recent increase in natural gas 
prices. Going forward, we will continue to determine operating levels for our 
plants based on the relationship between natural gas prices, nitrogen product 
prices and our customers' requirements, as we have been doing for some time." 

International imports are also hurting U.S. producers. Currently, there is a 
surplus of ammonia in the international market, which is holding ammonia 
prices down. U.S. fertilizer producers can't compete with the international 
market. Gas prices are 46 cents/MMBtu in Russia, 50 cents to $1/MMBtu in 
Argentina and Venezuela, and $1/MMBtu in Trinidad. The U.S. imports 5.5 
million tons of ammonia each year. Fertilizers represent 80% of the demand 
for ammonia in the United States. 

Terra Industries said its facilities would resume production as soon as it 
became economical again --- whether from gas prices declining or nitrogen and 
methanol prices rising, just as long as "prices reach levels allowing 
positive cash flows." 

Nyiri said he believes relief is in sight. He pointed out that the ammonia 
market has been sitting around the $205/ton level for the last several 
months, but believes ammonia prices will have to increase entering the next 
planting season. "I've got my model peaking out around $250/ton in April or 
May and at that time I have gas costs coming down." At that point, the 1-2 
Bcf/d of demand from the fertilizer production industry should begin 
returning to service.

In a letter last month (see Daily GPI, Oct. 19), Northwest announced a policy 
revision allowing a shipper holding capacity from Sumas to off-system 
delivery points to amend primary delivery points and shorten the path without 
being subject to a contractual OFO upon extending its contract term. However, 
citing "the current OFO situation on the pipeline system," Northwest said 
last week the policy change is under review and has been suspended until 
further notice. 


El Paso reported Thursday an injection unit at its Washington Ranch storage 
facility had gone down for emergency maintenance. Capacity through Pecos 
River Station has been reduced by 100 MMcf/d until further notice, causing 
the pipeline to impose allocations on Permian Basin production and deliveries 
of San Juan Basin gas to the South Mainline. 


El Paso said work on Lines 1106 and 1107 was extended by one more day, 
causing the shut-in of deliveries into El Paso at the IUTBENED and IHYBENDM 
interconnects to continue through Dec. 1. The delay also postpones scheduled 
work on Line 3137, which now will be shut in Dec. 4-5, affecting the 
IVALEROZ, ISONORA, ISHOZONA and IBARNHRT points. Line 3177 is scheduled for 
Dec. 7 inspection, affecting IMOBILPE.

Except Marketing:  




This is a reminder that we are going to begin Phase I of the Windows 
2000/Outlook Project.  In this phase, we will be gathering information about 
the hardware and software that you are using within your group.  

The process will begin with an email inventory.  You will receive an email on 
Monday, September 25, with the subject of W2K Inventory-Please Open.  All you 
need to do is open the email message.  Because the Marketing group's 
inventory was performed by Omaha, they should not open the message.  This 
email will do a quick inventory of applications you have installed on your PC 
or that you may access from the network, as well as your desktop hardware 
specifications.  The information gathered from this email will be stored in a 
Notes database for reporting.  It is very important that you open this email 
from your primary workstation.  Please do not open it remotely, or if you're

NGTS, whose main headquarters is located in Dallas, has a one-man office 
located in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  John Rohde purchases gas from 30 
small to medium sized suppliers in the Rocky Mountain area and either acts as 
their agent or moves their purchased gas to markets for NGTS.  Most of this 
gas generally either goes to the Rocky markets or to Northern Natural 
pipeline.  NGTS holds CIG capacity, and I have encouraged John to look at any 
future potential of making deliveries off CIG into TW at Tumbleweed.  John 
also indicated that he thought NGTS does have some equity San Juan gas  which 
currently flows on El Paso to California via capacity release.   I will 
pursue this fact with the proper individual in the Dallas office.

Subject: Revised Transportation Proposal

Hi Ed - Here is a revised comprehensive summary of the firm transportation 
proposal between Red Cedar and Transwestern:

Term:  5 years, January 1, 2001through December 31, 2005

Year	Volume	Rate(+option fee)
1	125,000 MMBtu/d*	$0.02/MMbtu/d
2	150,000 MMBtu/d	$0.025/MMBtu/d
3	150,000 MMBtu/d	$0.03/MMBtu/d
4	150,000 MMBtu/d	$0.035/MMBtu/d
5	150,000 MMBtu/d	$0.04/MMBtu/d
		

Option:  Red Cedar shall have a one-time option to reduce its contract MDQ 
for contract years 4 - 5 to a volume between 100,000 MMBtu/d - 150,000 
MMBtu/d.  Red Cedar may trigger this option anytime before November 30, 
2003.  Option fee is an incremental one-tenth of one cent/MMBtu (additive to 
the above quoted rates) over the five year term.

Facility Modifications:  The current cost estimate to increase the meter 
capacity (from 200,000 MMBtu/d to 300,000 MMBtu/d) at the Arkansas Loop Plant 
into Transwestern is $378,000.  * Year 1 capacity of 125,000 MMBtu is 
dependent upon the completion of these facility modifications.  Red Cedar 
will fund these facility modifications (by a one-time payment of $378,000 
payable prior to Transwestern ordering material for the modifications).  In 
order to avoid the tax gross-up of approximately $130,000, the $378,000 will 
be amortized over the term of the contract and booked as "pre-paid" 
transportation fees.  (The net effect of this will be zero because the slight 
increase/MMBtu which will show up on the monthly transportation invoice will 
be negated by the corresponding credit for the pre-paid transportation.)

Please call me to discuss.  Thanks.

Lorraine

Lorna,
Thanks.  Yes, we had heard that PG&E was looking to site a "big one" near 
Vegas.  It is speculated that this project may well be an anchor for a Kern 
River expansion.

Note:  I'm sure you have this on your radar screen, but just in case you 
don't...

PG&E Corp. announced that its National Energy Group will develop its first 
Nevada project, a 1,000 MW natural gas-fired generating plant to be located 
45 miles northeast of Las Vegas. The merchant plant's main purpose is to 
supply Nevada, but when it is not needed there, it will add much-needed 
supply to the western energy market. The group hopes to begin construction 
during the fourth quarter of 2001, with completion expected in early 2004. 
"Southern Nevada has one of the most rapidly growing economies in the 
country," said Thomas B. King, president of PG&E NEG, West Region. "Because 
of its location near Las Vegas, the Meadow Valley project will be ideally 
positioned to efficiently serve that demand growth." Including the Nevada 
project, PG&E National Energy Group has a total of 4,000 MW in development or 
construction in California, Oregon, Nevada and Arizona.

Quick Change in PG&E NW IT Allocation

Within hours of a FERC vote yesterday ratifying proposed changes in its 
interruptible transportation (IT) queue, PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest 
announced new procedures effective today. 

The Commission rejected shippers complaints to the new scheme and accepted 
PG&E NW's tariff sheets as of Oct. 25, saying the revisions were "generally 
in accord with industry practice and will simplify capacity allocation 
procedures." 

Under the revised tariff PG&E NW said "IT capacity will be allocated as 
follows: 

 First to shippers paying maximum rate; 

 If there are more confirmed IT nominations from shippers all paying the 
maximum rate, then IT capacity will be allocated pro-rata to the confirmed 
nominations.~ For example, if the capacity constraint were at Station 14, a 
shipper with a confirmed nomination paying maximum rate from Stanfield to 
Malin would be allocated capacity pro rata with a shipper with a confirmed 
nomination at the maximum rate for service from Kingsgate to Malin. 

 Second to shippers paying discounted rates or negotiated rates at less then 
the maximum rate. The discounted/negotiated IT space will be allocated on 
highest to lowest total revenue (rate x mileage).~ For example, a shipper 
with a confirmed nomination for service with a total revenue per Dth of $0.11 
would be awarded capacity ahead of a shipper with a confirmed nomination for 
service with a total revenue of $0.10, regardless of the path nominated. 

 Discounted IT shippers having the same total revenue will be allocated space 
on a pro ration of their confirmed nominations." 

Questions can be addressed to PG&E NW's transportation coordinator at 
503-833-4300.

Agave Energy - Agave purchased a seasonal winter transport agreement for 
7,000 MMBtu/d on the Atoka lateral through May 2001.  This effectively sells 
out the Atoka and actually bumped some gas Duke/GPM had been delivering to 
the pools for free.  Incremental revenue for this deal is $70,200.

EOG Resources - The new EOG well on the West Texas lateral has been connected 
to TW but we are waiting for them to install an EFM device before we allow 
the gas to flow.

Burlington Resources - The letter agreement amending the interconnect and 
operating contract for the Burlington Val Verde plant on the San Juan lateral 
was sent this week.  We will adjust the prior period and remaining 2000 
invoices once the contract is signed.

PNM Capacity - FERC issued a tolling order on our request for rehearing in 
the PNM capacity docket.  We had asked for rehearing of the order limiting 
TW's acquisition of capacity to summer-only months.  There is no deadline for 
the Commission to act on our request so we'll have to wait to see when it 
appears on the docket.

PG&E - Representatives visited TW's offices this week to discuss a number of 
things including western gas flows, storage, winter and summer peaking 
capability, and EDI interface possibilities.  In response to TW's request, 
Rod Boschee indicated they may increase their capacity to take TW gas from 
300,000 up to 400,000 MMBtu/d!!  They would like to implement this change 
before Thanksgiving (in time for bid week) but are waiting on some upper 
management approvals first.  To date, they have been very pleased with the 
efforts of TW personnel to clean up the various substances contaminating the 
PG&E line.

Please note the following request by Richardson to suspend another month of 
their contract for the month of August.  We will have to account for this 
contract suspension in the August forecast with an estimated loss of  
$116,203. 500  (35,700 MM/d * 31 days* $.105)

Dennis -   Our records indicate that the new terminate date should be 
4/31/02.  Let's discuss if you need some documentation to make the system 
reflect this termination date.  CS 

Perry - Please verify if your capacity sheets reflect this 4/31/02 terminate

El Paso South Mainline Shut-in Extended

The U.S. Transportation Department's Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) has 
ordered all three of the pipes comprising El Paso Natural Gas' 1 Bcf/d South 
Mainline from Texas to California to remain closed until extensive tests can 
be done to ensure they are safe to operate. 

The order came in the wake of Saturday's explosion and fire that ripped 
through one of those lines, the 30-inch pipeline 1103, at a Pecos River 
crossing near Carlsbad, NM, killing 11 people. 

Because of the internal corrosion discovered on the failed section of 
pipeline, OPS is directing El Paso to submit a corrective action plan for OPS 
approval that will identify all areas on approximately 330 miles of pipeline 
that may be subject to internal corrosion," said Kelley S. Coyner, head of 
the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) for the OPS, in a 
prepared statement. 

The DOT "is requiring that all segments of the three pipelines in the 
vicinity of Pecos River remain closed until such time that the department has 
determined that the pipeline segments are safe to operate." This is necessary 
to "protect the public and the environment and to prevent a similar failure 
on this pipeline system." 

The plan will require inspection, assessment, and repair or replacement of 
all damaged areas. 

"Based on the results of these and other tests, El Paso must develop a plan 
to assess the integrity of the remainder of its 10,000 mile pipeline system." 

The OPS "Corrective Action Order" was issued late Wednesday, after El Paso 
officials had been saying for most of the day it was only a matter of hours 
before at least one of the lines was back in operation. One industry source 
said testing could easily take three weeks to a month, even if no repairs are 
necessary. 

The OPS order directs El Paso to: 1) conduct hydrostatic pressure testing of 
the lines; 2) perform a direct assessment of the integrity of the pipelines 
by both X-ray and ultrasonic examinations; and 3) because internal corrosion 
has been detected in the failed section of the pipeline, El Paso also must 
submit a corrective action plan to OPS identifying all areas on the 
approximately 330 miles of pipeline that may have internal corrosion. 

Even if El Paso passes all these tests and OPS allows it to return to 
service, each of the three lines will be subject to a 20% pressure 
restriction, according to Coyner. The restriction will be reviewed in 10 
working days, and may be removed upon the receipt of more information about 
the factors that contributed to the Aug. 19 explosion. OPS has the authority 
to take other actions if warranted. 

The OPS yesterday issued the seven-page corrective action order, which 
permits it to suspend or restrict the operations of a pipeline, after it 
determined that the El Paso lines were hazardous. El Paso has been notified 
of the order, and it has 10 days to request a hearing to be held in either 
Houston or Washington DC. If El Paso fails to comply with any part of the 
order, it could face civil penalties of up to $25,000 a day, and the case 
could be referred to the U.S. Attorney General for "appropriate relief" in 
the U.S. District Court, according to Stacey Gerard, associate administrator 
for pipeline safety. 

Preliminary investigations of ruptured Line 1103 by the OPS and the National 
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) indicate that "significant internal 
corrosion was visible on the failed section. Internal corrosion may have been 
a contributing factor in the line failure. The possibility of internal 
corrosion on other lines in the area is a safety concern." 

The OPS order applies to the 30-inch Line 1103, which incurred the most 
damage, and the parallel 26-inch Line 1100 that "sustained an undetermined 
amount of damage at the Pecos River crossing due to the fire." It also covers 
the adjacent 30-inch Line 1110, whose damages are still undetermined. Lines 
1103 and 1110 were built in 1950, and Line 1100 in 1947. 

Within 90 days, El Paso will be required to submit to the OPS Southwest 
region director an "analysis of the continued safe operation" of the three 
lines "based on the testing and inspection required under this order." 

In related action. Rep. John Dingell (D-MI), who has been a sharp critic of 
OPS for its allegedly lax handling of pipeline safety violators, is in the 
process of drafting a letter to the agency to determine whether its failure 
to take aggressive action towards pipelines may have created an atmosphere 
that led to the tragedy on El Paso.

A hydrostatic test of Line 3201 identified some pipe that must be replaced, 
El Paso said Thursday, 
and once that is done the test must be performed again. It estimated the 
project will extend through 
Sunday, reducing Bondad Mainline capacity by 180 MMcf/d (normal capacity is 
675 MMcf/d) and 
affecting seven receipt points. With Line 3201 out of service, the 180 MMcf/d 
loss can not be made
 up at points downstream of Bondad Mainline, El Paso said. Thus the same (not 
additional) 
180 MMcf/d reduction must be applied at Gallup (NM) Station. 

PG&E Gas Transmission-Northwest said its Internet-based nomination system 
became operational 
again Thursday morning after a Wednesday evening power failure caused the 
server to crash. 

El Paso will hold meetings Aug. 9 in Houston, Aug. 10 in Los Angeles and Aug. 
11 in Phoenix to present 
details of its Line No. 2000 Project. The project requires FERC approval to 
abandon certain mainline 
compressor facilities and replace them with a 30-inch crude oil pipeline upon 
its conversion to natural 
gas service. El Paso announced early this year (see Daily GPI, Feb. 4) it was 
buying part of the 
All American Pipeline from Plains All American Pipeline L.P. and would invest 
$75 million to convert 
the segment to a natural gas pipeline. The segment being converted extends 
1,088 miles from Emidio, 
CA, to McCamey, TX. Those planning to attend one of next week's meetings 
should call Lisa Holmes at 
(915) 496-2568 or send e-mail to holmesl@epenergy.com.

Interactive Open Season - Two packages of transportation capacity were post=

on Friday 7/21 for auction.  Strong markets out west indicate we should=20

take place.  Thanks to all who made this come together.

Duke - We sold to Duke a firm transport agreement that will bring 20,000=20
MMBtu/d of incremental supply to TW's east end at the Crawford receipt=20
point.  The contract is a 2 year FT agreement beginning 8/1/00 for 20,000=

MMBtu/d from Crawford to Oasis (EOT - EOT) at $0.02 for year 1 and $0.0250=

for year two.

NGPL Winkler I/C - This interconnect was activated on Monday and began=20
flowing gas its first week of operation.  We received a nomination of 40,00=

MMBtu to supply western gas demand.

Southwest Gas - We received the shipper executed agreement in our office th=

week!

August Gas Sale - 10,000 MMBtu/d was sold for the month of August at=20
$4.10/MMBtu.

SoCal - Visited their office to discuss among several things the issue of t=
he=20
Needles Window.  SoCal's fluctuation of this set point has hampered TW's=20
throughput for several months now.  They agreed to give Transwestern a chan=

Additionally, PG&E has raised their window to 300,000 MMBtu/d.  These two=

events combined allowed TW to deliver near-record throughput to California=
=20
this week.  Thanks to everyone, including all Ops Team Members for helping=

make this happen.

PG&E - Met with Market Center personnel to discuss storage opportunities fo=
r=20
both TW & PG&E.  They were interested in the idea of using TW=01,s Park'N R=

Service when their storage was allocated (a role reversal from when we=20

talk daily to pursue any storage opportunities that arise.

El Paso Merchant Services was provided a 10-year proposal for transportatio=
n=20
in TW's East of Thoreau Area for a potential power plant load off of the=20
PG&E-Intrastate line beginning November 2001.  Initial expected load=20
requirements of 10-15,000 MMBtu/d may increase to 75,000/d during the term =
of=20
the agreement.  This would be incremental supply into TW's east end.

Unbound Technology - Met with Unbound representatives again this week.  Thi=

services TW could use in an effort to be more proactive with customers=20
regarding noms, confirmations, cut notices, and auction information.  We wi=

Also meant to tell you that Nicole Schwartz left Compaq last week and will
start at Enron this next Monday.  Look her up after she gets settled in.  I
told her you were there too.  Did you know her?  She worked for Linda a
while back, then transferred to campus on a special project with Michael
Takemura.  Then out of that to another group with Lisa Kaiser.
Just an FYI -
BYE!

Note:  WEFA has made some interesting points in their conclusions of this 
study.  

Gas Turbines Headed for a 50% Meltdown

High natural gas prices, performance issues and higher than expected 
maintenance costs, a general economic slowdown and several other key factors 
will combine to create a "near-term meltdown in the gas turbine market," 
according to a report by WEFA, Inc. 

Reporting on a study about to be published by the analysis and consulting 
firm based in Eddystone, PA, one of its authors predicted "a substantial 
short-term correction in the gas turbine market..which could render 50% of 
current North American projects uneconomic." Jason Makansi, principal of 
Makansi & Co., pointed to other factors, such as the inexperience of many 
generating companies with the hedging and trading skills necessary to 
optimize profits in the peaking market, the rise of "stealth capacity" from 
refitted or otherwise optimized coal and nuclear plants, "gas transportation 
bottlenecks and persistent issues with safety and explosions," and "a 
protracted quasi-regulatory quagmire." 

Under the heading of stealth capacity, "old assets are being purchased or 
merged into new electric economy organizations that will improve capacity 
factors at coal-fired plants from the typical 60-65% to perhaps 80-85% within 
five years." A major part of the gain will come simply from operating the 
assets to serve the market and not just a single service territory, Makansi 
said. He reported on the soon-to-be released study at WEFA's World Economic 
Conference last week in New York. 

The nuclear industry is experiencing a similar transformation. Several years 
ago predictions were that as much as one-third of nuclear plants would soon 
be retired. Today, with many units sold to new owners and re-licensed, it 
appears the retirement rate will be more like 5-10% and productivity for the 
remaining units will be increased. 

The WEFA report points to a "technological correction" for the advanced 
technology "F-Class" turbines going into most new plants today, as unexpected 
problems crop up with extended use. There are a host of problems in the 
technology area, which can be met, but at a cost: the new units may not meet 
emissions targets without impacting efficiency, heat rate and durability; 
fuel-switching is not living up to its advance billing; units may not perform 
as well at high ambient temperatures; overhauls are required more frequently 
than had been expected; maintenance costs also are exceeding expectations; 
and fuel quality is becoming an issue. 

"Variable O&M costs at some projects with F-class machines are running as 
high as $25,000 to $30,000 per start. Considering that some of these machines 
may exhibit several hundred starts in a year, you have a variation of that 
worn phrase, "a start here, a start there, pretty soon you're talking about 
real money!" 

"The bottom line of all this is that many of the claimed performance 
advantages of the gas turbine have been lost or severely eroded." Makansi 
also pointed to similar experiences with gas turbines in the U.K., Asia, 
Australia, and Chile. He predicted a turbine market correction "and an 
unavoidable plateau to work out technological kinks, modify designs and 
inject reality into business models. We believe all this will push 
consolidation in the generation sector of the electricity industry even 
faster." Makansi predicted about half a dozen major players will control 50% 
of the generation capacity in the U.S. within five to 10 years. 

Co-authors of the report include Robert Swanekamp, a principal of Competitive 
Power Resources; engineering consultant Jeffrey J. Fassett; and Kemm Farney, 
vice president, WEFA Electric Power Service. For more information go to

Sempra Could Be Takeover Candidate, Newspaper Says
 
The London Telegraph newspaper quoted an analyst who said that U.K.-based 
Centrica could 
be eyeing Sempra Energy as a possible takeover candidate following Centrica's 
purchase of 
Canadian gas and electricity supplier Direct Energy. 

Direct Energy owns a 27.5% stake in Energy America, whose remaining equity 
belongs to Sempra. 
The newspaper quoted Simon Hawkins, an analyst with UBS Warburg, as saying 
the Direct Energy 
acquisition is "step one of something much bigger." In principle, he said, 
there is no reason why 
Centrica shouldn't go after Sempra. Centrica told the newspaper it was 
"talking to Sempra about 
the way forward."

El Paso Pipeline Update - The US Dept. of Transportation approved reinstating 
gas service for El Paso's Line 1100 damaged in the recent explosion.  This 
brought 400 million cfd of capacity back on stream to the California border.  
The ruptured Line 1103 will not be repaired until further investigations have 
been completed.  The availability of Line 1100 capacity had the following 
basis impact:  Permian to California basis for October dropped from Monday by 
$1.30/MMBtu while November '00 - March '01 and April - October '01 narrowed 
by $0.43 and $0.37 respectively.  Also, TW shippers are no longer using El 
Paso Window Rock as a receipt point on our system.

Transport Options Program - Representatives from 7 companies comprising a 
majority of TW's larger shippers attended our workshop on this new tariff 
filing.  All attendees were given in advance of the meeting a draft copy of 
the proposed filing for their review and comment.  The TW Team (Jeff Fawcett 
and Susan Scott) did an outstanding job of preparing the material, answering 
questions, and anticipating shipper concerns related to this new service.  
The only serious objections raised  by the customers were concerns related 
to: (1) potential abuses by marketing affiliates and (2) hoarding of option 
capacity by any one shipper.  Among the  solutions proposed were restricting 
Enron affiliates  access to the program and limiting the volume of 
outstanding options any one shipper can hold.  At the end of the meeting, we 
asked for final comments to be submitted to TW by next week in anticipation 
of filing the tariff with the FERC in mid-September.

KN/Oneok Contract -  We negotiated a 12 month max rate agreement with Oneok 
for 20,000 MMBtu/d of west flow capacity starting February 1, 2001.  We also 
negotiated in the contract a provision whereby if Oneok releases any of the 
capacity above the max rate, then TW shares 50/50 in the incremental revenue.

EOG Resources - We are negotiating a new transport agreement with EOG for 
incremental volume they could bring into TW's West Texas lateral.  Initially, 
the volume was 4 - 5,000 MMBtu/d but now may be at least 15,000 MMBtu/d.  EOG 
is reviewing the proposed interconnect and operating agreement.  EOG has not 
typically held transport capacity on TW in the past.

September Pipe Outage - We are trying to accommodate west flowing shippers 
whose transport will be cut from September 6-10 due to DOT testing on 
Transwestern.  The plan is to facilitate the use of PG&E Market Center 
storage to supply west markets during the outage.  Volume may be as high as 
20 -50,000 MMBtu/d at an incremental rate for TW of $.05 -.08/MMBtu.

of marketing and communication, will be on hand to discuss Enron's new 
employee satisfaction survey:  The Pulse.
We hope you'll be able to participate in both events, but if you can't, be 
sure to pre-submit your questions on the eSpeak site.


Incubate your intelligence.  How?  First, recognize you have competitive 
intelligence.  Second, go to the Edge and post competitive intelligence. It's 
that easy.  We'll look for you on the Edge.


Stop by eMeet today and see the latest posting in the Office of the Chairman 
category.  And, remember, this is a discussion forum.  Feel free to add your 
thoughts to what the Office of the Chairman has to say.

Please see attached file.  The margins are lower as compared to last weeks 
because of a lower fuel index price and lower volumes do to the trail 
derailment.

We want to know what you think.

We all know that communication is one of Enron's core values.   We have 
introduced several new communication tools in the last year, like eThink and 
eBiz, that complement our more traditional methods of communicating, such as 
Enron Business (print and online) and face-to-face meetings.

The internal communications team would like you to take a few minutes and 
complete the following survey about the communication tools you find most 
effective.  Please give us your honest feedback about the tools and methods 
you use most often -- and tell us about the ones you don't use or need.

We appreciate your time.  Your feedback will help us tailor our communication 
efforts to better meet your needs.

Kevin Hyatt and I attended Sempra Energy Trading's weather derivatives 
briefing in Houston last night, chaired by their chief meterologist, Dan 
Guertin.  Dan's forecast for the winter of '00-01 seems to track pretty much 
lockstep with the CPC's.  Dan also believes that this will be an 
"oceanographic neutral" winter, with no El Nino or La Nina influences.  He 
sees slightly above average temperatures for the western marketplace and a 
relatively "normal" winter pattern (30 yr. avg.) for the mid-continent.

As far as monthly variations, he is predicting a cooler than usual November - 
December, and a slightly warmer than usual pattern for the remainder of the 
heating season.  He has promised to make his presentation information 
available to the briefing attendees.  If I can secure a copy of it, I'll pass 
it on.

Subject: CPC's Winter Weather Prediction for the U.S.

Climate Prediction Center Winter  Outlook
?
??? The Climate Prediction Center,  a unit of the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, discusses the  outlook for this winter. The 
agency does not expect El Nino and La Nina to  affect global weather for the 
next nine months. The two weather patterns, which  occur because of changes 
in ocean temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, directly  influence US rain 
patterns and land temperatures. The CPC says this winter will  be the first 
year in three that the US has not had a strong influence from this  
particular climate-driving force. But, that does not mean there will be a 
whole  lot of difference in terms of when winter will start. It will have 
something to  do with temperatures, because both La Nina and El Nino have 
tended to make  temperatures moderate in the winter.? The CPC expects that 
this winter  nationwide on average will still be slightly warmer than normal, 
but not as warm  as the last three. The northern part of the nation and 
particularly the  Northeast, however, could be an exception with colder 
weather. The warmer  pattern will be confined more to the West and the South. 
East of the Mississippi  with the exception of Florida should be cooler this 
winter and most of  California and the northern half of the Rockies and the 
Dakotas. For the fall  and winter, expect the Southwest to be the mild and 
dry.

EIA Predicts Supply Shortfall Will Linger Through Winter

The Energy Information Administration said yesterday in its September 
Short-Term Energy Outlook it is projecting natural gas prices at the wellhead 
will increase by about 87% this winter (October-March) compared to last 
winter. Residential prices for gas are expected to rise on average by 27% 
compared to last year. For the entire year, the average wellhead price for 
natural gas is projected to be $3.40/Mcf, the highest annual wellhead price 
on record (in inflation-adjusted terms, it would be the highest annual 
average price since 1985). 

The short-term supply constraints that are currently hindering the industry's 
ability to meet storage and power generation demand at the same time are 
likely to continue into the heating season, EIA said. Storage levels could 
end up being about 8% below the five-year average of about 3,000 Bcf by the 
start of winter if net injections continue at 10% below historically average 
rates through the remainder of the refill season. 

The effects of increased drilling for gas are not expected to appear in the 
form of significantly increased production until after the next heating 
season, according to the agency's report. 

"For now, we are continuing to maintain a conservative view of possible 
increases in domestic gas production for 2000 and 2001, with assumed 
increases of 0.5% and 1%, respectively, for this year and next...," the EIA 
report stated. "On the other hand, the U.S. natural gas rig count on Aug. 25 
was at a recent high of 794 rigs. Exploration and production budgets for many 
natural gas producers are expected to increase sharply in 2000 and 2001, 
spurred by higher prices and greatly improved current and expected revenues 
from producing assets. Also on the positive side, data from the Texas 
Railroad Commission suggest that, through May, year 2000 gas production 
increased, if only slightly (0.4%). This signifies a turnaround (however 
modest) in a key producing region. Very high gas drilling rates, including a 
record-setting pace in deep offshore Gulf of Mexico, confirm that 
increasingly positive results for domestic gas production are under way." 

Imports are projected to rise by about 12% next year primarily because of the 
1.35 Bcf/d Alliance Pipeline coming on line next month. 

Meanwhile the demand outlook remains bullish at 4.2% annual growth. In 2001, 
however, the forecast has been revised downward to 2.5% growth because of 
higher than expected natural gas prices. The industrial sector is the leading 
sector for demand increases in 2000 at 9.3%, while electric utility demand is 
expected to decline by 4.0% primarily because of power plant sales. For the 
power generation sector as a whole, gas demand is expected to grow 6.5% this 
year and 1.5% in 2001. EIA said the reduced growth rate next year is largely 
due to the reversal in relative prices of fuel oil and natural gas, which 
began in August, with fuel oil gaining the price advantage as gas prices 
continued to rise. 

Gas demand this winter is expected to be up by 5.7% compared to last winter 
if weather is normal. Normal weather implies a 12% rise in heating 
degree-days compared with last winter.

Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing.

There are a couple of important changes from the last draft.

One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be 
"market-based."  At FERC, the term "market-based" has connotations of having 
to prove to FERC that a non-cost-based rate is appropriate because we lack 
market power.  While we probably do lack market power, the consensus of the 
legal/regulatory team was to try to portray the option fee as a built-in 
feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated into a 
separate option fee.  If this theory is not clear to you after you read the 
filing letter, let's discuss how it should be improved.

The other significant change (also based on my meeting with legal/regulatory) 
is that I've structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every 
shipper, regardless of whether they currently use transport on TW, will have 
to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option.  In other 
words, a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply 
execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.  This structure has two 
advantages:  1) it's consistent with our option-fee-as-part-of-transport-rate 
theory, and 2) it will help support that theory in our next rate case.

I'd like to meet next week, either Wednesday afternoon or Thursday, to 
discuss the following topics:

1)  Your comments and questions on this draft,
2)  Some examples of options, to make sure the tariff provisions and contract 
work from a logistical standpoint,
3)  The bidding process, and how bids for options will be evaluated, and
4)  Comments received from shippers thus far.

I'll be working on 41 tomorrow; let's talk about what would be a good meeting 
time.
I will be out Mon. and Tues.

Hi Teresa,
Believe it or not, I just got my directory...I guess they finally figured out 
where I am located!  I also found out that I need to correct the company for 
my directory information.  It needs to be Enron Transportation & Storage 
instead of Enron Corporation.  Thanks and talk to you soon!

Here's the calcs I used for purposes of evaluating proposals for July - Oct, 
EOT to PG&E (Mojave values should be similar):

Current basis

EPNG Permian    -$0.41
SoCal Border    +$0.12
 Gross Spread   +$0.53

Fuel 5%     -$0.18 NYMEX, $4.10 minus $.41 basis = $3.49/MMBtu
 SoCal Spread Net Fuel  +$0.35

Current market diff. SoCal v. PG&E -$0.20 (+/-) *variable according to market 
maker
Spread value (financial)   +$0.15

Physical v. financial diff.   -$0.03 (+/-)
Spread value (physical)   +$0.12

USGT called back and said they'd be willing to do th $0.12.  I told them we'd 
heard higher, maybe as high as something with a "two" in it.  She called back 
and said they could maybe get to a mid-teens number, but certainly not 20's.

As you may have noticed, there was a network error during today's eSpeak with 
Dr. Ben Gilad.  Although the questions and answers were not visible during 
the second half of the eSpeak session, Dr. Gilad did answer all the questions 
he received.  As always, the transcript of the discussion will be available 
in the eSpeak archives.  

If the technical issue prevented you from asking a question during today's 
session, please email your question to Amy Oberg at Enron Energy Services.  
Dr. Gilad has generously offered to respond to questions that could not be 
submitted during the live event.

El Paso announced changes to its pipeline cleaning and internal inspection 
program. Line 1100 between Eunice and Pecos River Stations will be smart 
pigged Sunday (postponed one day), causing a 200 MMcf/d flow reduction 
through Eunice to the South Mainline. Six interconnects will not be able to 
deliver into El Paso for 10 hours that day. Another smart pigging of Line 
1100 between Pecos River and Guadalupe Stations will occur Nov. 22 (also 
postponed one day), requiring a reduction of 200 MMcf/d through Pecos River. 
Line 1203 (Maricopa Line) pigging will be done Nov. 21-24, reducing the 
line's capacity by 60 MMcf/d and affecting deliveries of San Juan gas to the 
Phoenix area. Line 3222 pigging will be done Nov. 30 and Dec. 19, causing a 
100 MMcf/d allocation. Line 3201 pigging will be done Dec. 2 and 20, causing 
a 150 MMcf/d allocation. The allocations will affect points upstream of 
Bondad Mainline and Gallup.

Coastal Corp. announced that Engage Energy U.S., L.P. has changed its name to 
Coastal Merchant Energy, L.P., which coincides with the split of the Engage 
Energy joint venture by participants Coastal and Westcoast Energy. Effective 
on Oct. 3, the operations were divided into separate entities which are owned 
and operated solely by each company. Coastal Merchant Energy, which handles 
up to 3.5 Bcf/d, appointed James C. Dyer IV as president and CEO. "Coastal 
Merchant Energy, L.P. will continue to provide a full spectrum of energy 
services, including natural gas marketing and trading, electricity trading 
and sales, energy management services, structured storage and 
transportation-related services, structured power and management services, 
and energy risk management services," said David A. Arledge, CEO of The 
Coastal Corp. "We will undoubtedly benefit from the further integration of 
our merchant activities with Coastal's asset-based businesses."

Drive to Succeed: Enron Prefers Toyota to GM

To prosper in the new energy economy, Enron COO Jeffrey K. Skilling says oil 
and gas companies need to trash their traditional business models and instead 
reshape themselves to resemble Toyota when it captured the imagination and 
pocketbook of U.S. consumers 30 years ago. 

In a somewhat back-to-the-future treatise on how Enron expects to continue 
its monumental success, Skilling told Arthur Andersen Energy Conference 
attendees to define themselves not by their industry, but rather by their 
skills base. Toyota changed the U.S. auto industry by outsourcing its 
production, offering customers exactly what they wanted cheaper and faster. 
The energy industry has to do the same thing into the future, he told the 
Houston audience. 

"In 1982, the energy industry was a very rigid industry," he said, pointing 
to a similar business model that had been used by General Motors and Ford 
Motor Co. Those companies did every bit of the manufacturing process, keeping 
all of its pieces within the corporate structure. Then Toyota turned things 
upside down. 

When a customer wanted a different radio, Toyota relied on outside producers. 
It didn't stop the production line to please the customer. And it was able to 
do it faster. Enron has used the same model to shape its achievements, 
packaging components for customers to save time and money. Other energy 
companies are now adopting that method. 

In many ways, Skilling said Enron views itself as the Toyota of the energy 
industry. "We don't feel we have to provide all components, but package them 
the way the customer wants them. This is a pervasive trend we are seeing all 
over the industry." 

Enron, which has had a shareholder return of 1,333% in 10 years (January 1990 
to November 2000), saw the changes required by new technology and 
deregulation and redefined its core competencies, which grew from its 
pipeline business. Skilling said to remain successful, the Houston-based 
corporation plans to continue to morph. 

"It all hinges on one good idea Enron had in the 1980s, that vertically 
integrated structures had dominated our industry and the structures were 
starting to break up. In the energy industry, the reason was deregulation. 
Fundamentally, this is a better business structure for two reasons: you can 
be supplied with cheaper cost components and it allows you to change much 
more quickly." 

Instead of bigger energy companies, Skilling said he expects to see many 
smaller companies, "maybe thousands tied together electronically and 
vertically." The transformation and interaction costs are "collapsing across 
the economy." As an example of interaction costs, Skilling used bank tellers. 
In 1985, it cost a bank $1.50 a transaction. To bank on the Internet today, 
it costs a bank less than a penny. 

This drop in interaction costs is a major reason Enron finds the bandwidth 
market so attractive. In 1995, the length of time to provision bandwidth was 
six to eight months. Today, it's two to three months. And next year, Skilling 
predicts it will take one second. 

"We will have bandwidth on demand by next year," he said, and added that 
Enron plans to be the leader in the field. 

Similarly, long-term gas contracts in 1982 took two to three years to 
execute. In 1989, they took nine months. Three years ago, they took two weeks 
to execute. Today, using EnronOnline and other similar Internet trading 
systems, it takes less than one second. 

"All of the sudden the world has changed. We have the same manufacture cost, 
but interactive costs collapse. I think that because of this, we'll see the 
collapse and demise of integrated energy companies around the world," 
Skilling said. 

To survive, Skilling advised companies to "virtually reintegrate" what they 
need. "If you have an old vertically integrated mind set, it's tough. Give it 
up. I know there are still power producers who are buying gas reserves. I 
don't get it. It makes no sense whatsoever. You can get it online at the 
lowest cost. If your business strategy is dependent on this, it will be a 
very hard row to hoe." 

Each stage of production will become increasingly competitive in the next 10 
years, predicted the Enron president. "You're not just competing against 
three people in West Texas, but thousands around the world." 

Opportunities exist, he said, for those companies that "go with the flow and 
find ways to compete. Create low cost, dependable market interfaces...provide 
packaged turnkey solutions for customers through complex structures, 
differentiation and customization." 

The only threat is from the old way of doing business, he said. "But there is 
tremendous opportunity to do things for customer you've never been able to 
do." He suggested a "new" energy model based on brainpower, networking, 
offering real options to customers, moving quickly and being entrepreneurial. 

"At Enron, this has been the whole premise: to be able to change by 
responding and reacting to the environment. By getting components together 
and packaging them for the customer."

Note:  FYI

Fitch Puts 2 CA Utilities on Negative Watch 

In the midst of the continuing uncertainty over regulatory treatment of 
growing wholesale electricity cost under-collections, Fitch Tuesday assigned 
a "rating watch negative" designation to the securities of California's two 
largest investor-owned utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern 
California Edison (and its parent company, Edison International). In 
addition, it lowered Edison's commercial paper rating one notch to "F1" from 
"F1+". 

Fitch cited the need for "significant and extensive regulatory decisions" to 
resolve the continuing problem of retail utility electric rate 
under-collections plaguing both utilities. It indicated that with the "watch 
negative" status, the independent rating service expects to review the 
ratings within six months. 

A spokesperson for PG&E Corp., the parent of Pacific Gas and Electric, said 
the Fitch move doesn't lower any of its ratings, but it "underscores the 
seriousness of the situation (in California) and the need for all the parties 
to come together for a collaborative solution." The companies have asked for 
relief from the California Public Utilities Commission (see Daily GPI, Oct. 
30). Edison is the target of an investors' lawsuit which accuses it of 
illegally booking as revenue the wholesale power costs that have yet to be 
collected. (see Daily GPI, Nov. 1). 

The Fitch move had no effect on PG&E's latest utility debt line extension of 
$1.3 billion that was implemented recently in response to the continuing 
under-collections, the spokesperson said. Fitch reiterated that through 
September the two utilities had booked under-collections exceeding $5 billion 
collectively and that wholesale power prices continue to exceed the 
utilities' frozen retail rate levels. 

"While these amounts exceed immediate funding requirements, their recovery 
through rates is uncertain," Fitch stated in its announcement on the negative 
watch. "Barring a change in regulatory policy, PG&E and SoCal Edison 
anticipate they will be unable to recover their under-collections before the 
end of the statutory rate freeze period ending March 31, 2002.

Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on 
Transwestern.  The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff 
language and a proposed form agreement.

Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.  I am 
distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue 
about the larger issues first.  A few that come to mind are whether we want 
to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the 
option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC 
should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future 
capacity for shippers.  Please let me know your thoughts on these and any 
other issues.  

I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming 
changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have 
resolved the substantive issues.  Thanks.

Climate Prediction Center Winter  Outlook
?
??? The Climate Prediction Center,  a unit of the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, discusses the  outlook for this winter. The 
agency does not expect El Nino and La Nina to  affect global weather for the 
next nine months. The two weather patterns, which  occur because of changes 
in ocean temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, directly  influence US rain 
patterns and land temperatures. The CPC says this winter will  be the first 
year in three that the US has not had a strong influence from this  
particular climate-driving force. But, that does not mean there will be a 
whole  lot of difference in terms of when winter will start. It will have 
something to  do with temperatures, because both La Nina and El Nino have 
tended to make  temperatures moderate in the winter.? The CPC expects that 
this winter  nationwide on average will still be slightly warmer than normal, 
but not as warm  as the last three. The northern part of the nation and 
particularly the  Northeast, however, could be an exception with colder 
weather. The warmer  pattern will be confined more to the West and the South. 
East of the Mississippi  with the exception of Florida should be cooler this 
winter and most of  California and the northern half of the Rockies and the 
Dakotas. For the fall  and winter, expect the Southwest to be the mild and 
dry.

El Paso, Coastal Consolidate Pipeline Staff

El Paso Energy and Coastal Corp. announced plans yesterday to relocate more 
than 1,200 employees and retain only satellite offices at the El Paso Natural 
Gas headquarters in El Paso, TX, and the ANR Pipeline headquarters in 
Detroit, MI, once their merger is approved by the FTC, which is expected 
sometime in the fourth quarter. No final decision on staff reductions has 
been made, an El Paso spokeswoman said. 

The companies intend consolidate the operations of their five pipeline 
systems into three organizations, collectively led by John W. Somerhalder II. 
Under the consolidation plan, the combined company's nationwide pipeline 
system will be consolidated into three regional operations. The western 
region will consist of El Paso Natural Gas Company and Colorado Interstate 
Gas Company and will be headquartered in Colorado Springs, CO. The eastern 
region will consist of ANR Pipeline and Tennessee Gas Pipeline and will be 
headquartered in Houston. Southern Natural will make up the southeastern 
region headquartered in Birmingham, AL. 

John Somerhalder will continue as the executive vice president of the El Paso 
Pipeline Group. Patricia A. Shelton, currently president of El Paso Natural 
Gas, will lead the consolidated western region pipelines. Jay Holm, currently 
responsible for El Paso's Australian pipeline assets, will return to the 
United States to become CEO of the eastern region. Reporting to Holm as 
presidents of Tennessee and ANR will be Stephen C. Beasley and James J. 
Cleary, respectively. The southeastern region will be led by James C. 
Yardley, who will continue as president of Southern. Shelton, Holm, and James 
Yardley will report to Somerhalder. 

"This consolidation will create the most effective organization for El Paso's 
pipeline system," said El Paso CEO William A. Wise. "Our upcoming merger with 
Coastal will create an interstate transmission system that spans the nation, 
border to border and coast to coast. This consolidation represents a highly 
disciplined approach to managing this system, allowing us to strike a proper 
balance between customer focus and operational efficiency. It also 
facilitates a company-to-company exchange of expertise across our system and 
speeds the merging of separate company cultures." 

While the companies will be organizationally merged, the five pipeline 
systems will remain separate with separate tariffs and separate names. Though 
many back office functions such as accounting and gas control will be 
consolidated and relocated to the new headquarters, field functions and 
related activities will remain in their current locations. In addition, some 
employees will remain in the El Paso and Detroit locations. The company will 
ask affected employees whether they want to be considered for relocation. 
Those employees who elect not to relocate will be given severance packages. 
Most moves will occur during the first half of next year, and the majority of 
the plan is expected to be implemented by mid-2001. 

The companies announced their $16 billion polling-of-interests transaction in 
January (see Daily GPI, Jan. 19). The merger is expected to be accretive to 
El Paso's earnings per share (EPS) immediately and add more than 5% to EPS in 
both 2001 and 2002, Wise said at the time of the merger announcement. 
Overall, the two companies expect $200 million in cost savings. By 
comparison, the El Paso-Sonat merger created more than $100 million in 
savings and more than 600 people lost their jobs. 

The combined interstate transmission system of the new company will consist 
of over 58,000 miles of pipeline, by far the most of any pipeline company in 
North America. The system will transport more than 20 Bcf/d of gas through 
existing pipeline infrastructure, but will have sole or part ownership in 
three other new or proposed major pipelines, including Alliance, Gulfstream 
and Independence. The company also will be the second largest gatherer of 
natural gas in the United States and the third largest U.S. producer of gas.

Subject: White Elephant Christmas Luncheon


OK Gang, we will be having the 2nd Annual White Elephant Christmas Luncheon 
again this year, on Monday December 18th  at 11:30.  To be included in this 
exciting game of chance, you are required to bring a covered dish and a 
wrapped gift of $10.00 or less.  These gifts can be gifts of use, or gag 
gift.  The same rules will apply this year as last, and that is, you can only 
trade your gift twice and your out of the game.  

Julia is kind enough to provide the honey glazed ham, plates, dinner ware and 
ice tea, which we will have in EB4102. Please bring a covered dish, hours d' 
oeuvres or a dessert (keep in mind, we could have a lot of people attend).  
She is also extending her invitation to the other departments on this floor, 
in hopes they would like to participate.

Julie, Candace and Audrey, could you please forward this on to your groups 
within the 41st floor.

See ya there!!!!!!!!
Ricki

 I have eight tickets for this Friday and Saturday to the Texaco Grand Prix. 
If you would like the tickets to take customers please let me know. First 
come first served. In case of a tie we will use a lottery system but you must 
notify me ahead  of time if you wish to witness the lottery (sound familiar?).

Subject: Caithness Big Sandy, LLC. Project

The project's consultant, George Briden, of Snake Hill Energy, called me 
today to say that Caithness Corp. has decided to move forward with plans for 
the Big Sandy, LLC. Project.  To refresh your memory, the project is a 
proposed IPP to be located about 40 miles south of TW's pipeline along 
Highway 93, about 2 miles outside of Wickieup, Arizona.  I've attached a 
simple bitmap below (click on it and hit "view") indicating the location of 
the project relative to Transwestern's facilities.  Ultimately, the project 
would be built for approx. 1,000 MW of generation in two phases.  Phase 1 
will burn approx. 80,000 Dth/d, and phase 2 will burn an additional 120,000 
Dth/d.  Initial indications are for the project to be in service in early 
2002, with the lateral pipeline and gas service required as early as Q2, 2001.

Caithness Corp., based in New York, is a privately held company with diverse 
interests including geothermal (renewable) electric generation facilities 
(Coso Plant) in California.  George reported that Caithness would like for 
Transwestern to build, own and operate the plant with facility costs (current 
estimate, $20.3MM) to be amortized vis-a-vis a throughput/rate commitment.  
Caithness would also like the project to be interconnected to El Paso's 
system and the Questar Southern Trails Pipeline if that project should ever 
be completed.

Obviously, we'll have to wade throught the legal/regulatory issues 
surrounding this deal structure, as well as the requisite credit assurances.  
With respect to the former, I think if we view this pipeline 
ownership/operation structure more as a financing mechanism with associated 
operating agreements, then we're probably OK.  With respect to the later, 
George assured me that Caithness can/will set-up a funding mechanism that 
would give Transwestern sufficient assurance of payback.

George would like to bring down a couple of representatives from Caithness to 
meet with Transwestern sometime the week of July 10.  He suggested either 
Omaha or Houston for the meeting, inasmuch as he'd like Drew Fossum to be 
present.

Drew, I'm thinking it might be easier/better to have the meeting here in 
Houston given our immediate access to maps and engineering data regarding the 
lateral pipeline.  If you concur, what day(s) do you have open that week and 
is there an opportunity for you to hop Bill's plane for either one or both 
legs of the trip down here?  I'll ask Ron Matthews and maybe one or two 
others to join us so we can cover a fairly broad base of functions in one 
sitting.

Will you get back with me as soon as you can?  Others on the distribution, if 
you can sit tight we'll get you more information as this meeting date/time 
comes together.  Thanks.

*********************************************************

Western Markets Disconnect
The western energy markets are currently in a pricing
crisis. Power supply shortages and threats of system
blackouts have resurfaced this winter in California, and
spiking natural gas prices have become the latest energy
headache for the West. Gas prices along the Pacific
corridor from Kingsgate in the North to Topock in the
South have jumped to over $40.00 per MMBtu during
December after averaging over $15.00 per MMBtu through
the second half of November. Extreme weather, strong
power demand for gas, and unusually low gas storage
levels have combined to intensify the demand for
pipeline gas and have exposed a latent capacity
bottleneck in bringing gas to this far western corridor.
The result is prices that dramatically "disconnected"
from the rest of the North American gas market in a way
that is more typical of Northeast markets during the
winter.

The vulnerability to additional spikes will endure as
the demand drivers combined with weakened storage
inventories will maintain price pressure on western
price points throughout the winter. However, the recent
jumps in western gas market differentials-to more than a
$10 per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hub-should ease
somewhat with a break in the weather. Under any weather
scenario, spikes up into the $15.00-$20.00 per MMBtu
range will be a feature of winter markets along the West
Coast. On balance, we expect West Coast price
differentials to average at a $4.00-$8.00 per MMBtu
premium through winter. The spring hydroelectric runoff
season should offer the first opportunity for a break in
differentials that could drop back to more typical
levels of less than $1.00 per MMBtu.

Over the long term, increased pipeline capacity and
additional gas supply are needed to break the
vulnerability to future West Coast price spikes.
However, significant new capacity additions are still 12
to 24 months away. In the meantime-particularly this
winter-sustained high and volatile price differentials
and extremely high absolute prices at western points are
likely to draw the increased attention of state
regulators and the FERC, as winter heating demand
exposes residential customers to the direct cost of the
crisis.

Building Up to the Price Spike
The first signs of natural gas price spikes and
disconnects emerged this summer, as sharp year-over-year
increases in demand pushed pipeline utilization rates to
new highs. As pipeline capacity constraints into
California became evident, differentials in Southern
California moved up to a $1.00 per MMBtu premium to the
Henry Hub. These extremely high prices, as well as low
forward spreads, discouraged storage injections through
the summer. As a result, a strong storage position early
in the summer deteriorated rapidly from May through
July. In August a lateral on El Paso's southern system
exploded; the accident further limited pipeline capacity
into California for a two-week period. During that time,
the market drew heavily on storage inventories and
further weakened storage positions. As hydroelectric
generation declined through the summer, the price
strength extended into Northern California. Malin, which
had been pricing near parity with the Henry hub in the
summer, began trading at a $0.50 per MMBtu premium to
the Henry Hub in September. The summer and early fall
market set the stage for continued and more intense
spikes this winter. The following factors are now
driving this market:

* Continuing surges in gas demand. Gas demand levels
have remained high since early summer, driven by higher
overall demand for electricity and lower hydroelectric
output. Demand levels for the third quarter in the US
West averaged 10.7 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day, up
from 8.7 Bcf per day during the third quarter 1999.
Persistently strong gas-fired generation production
through the fall months diverted gas to power
production, frustrating efforts to fill storage. This
pressure will continue. The year-over-year demand
increases from the power sector will be compounded, as
evidenced in November, by swings upward in residential
and commercial heating demand of 800 million cubic feet
(MMcf) per day. Overall, CERA expects nearly 1.6 Bcf per
day of increased demand in the West this winter, with
the critical California and Pacific Northwest regions
showing 1.2 Bcf per day of increased demand. Key power
sector drivers, including the strong economy, colder
weather, and lower hydroelectric generation, will
continue to push gas-fired generation.

* Pipeline utilization nears capacity. Strong western
demand for gas has pushed utilization rates on western
pipes to high levels. Flows from British Columbia into
the Northwest pipeline have remained at high levels
since summer, while flows from the Rockies on Northwest
have remained at pipeline capacity. Flows on PGT into
Kingsgate have remained at or near capacity, although
approximately 300 MMcf per day of excess capacity exists
on PGT into California at Malin. Likewise, flows out of
the Rockies on Kern River pipeline have consistently
remained at capacity. The only slack pipeline capacity
remaining for West Coast gas markets has been on
Southwest pipes. During the past few months, these
pipelines have operated at their highest utilization
rates since the addition of capacity from Canada early
last decade. The high utilization of western pipeline
capacity-reminiscent of power plant capacity constraints
that helped propel power prices to all time highs in the
West this summer-leaves very little slack capacity to
provide a relief valve for demand spikes. And that is
exactly what has driven prices during the past few weeks
(see Figure 1). Given the level of storage inventories
and expected gas demand, flows on the El Paso and
Transwestern pipelines will have to reach even higher
flow levels from December through March than they have
averaged through November.

* Deteriorating storage position. At the start of
November California storage inventories held at 154 Bcf,
a full 32 Bcf below the five-year average inventory
level. The strong in-state withdrawals during November
weakened that position to 128 Bcf; the deficit swelled
to 62 Bcf. Inventories in California have never fallen
below 60 Bcf, so deliverability through the end of
winter is likely less than 700 MMcf per day. Storage
inventories in California are so low that utilities'
ability to balance withdrawals from storage with
purchases from demand-sensitive price points is severely
limited. If the cold weather blast anticipated for mid-
December materializes, this effort at balance will be
even further compromised for the remainder of winter
(see Figure 2).

* Short-term contracting. A significant amount of
western gas is purchased or indexed to the spot market.
A shift from term contracts for both gas and pipeline
capacity to spot transactions-in many cases in response
to gas and power industry deregulation-has left the West
much more exposed to spot market volatility. In other
areas of the country, utilities have significant firm
pipeline capacity extending from supply regions to the
citygate and/or have forward purchased gas (at previous
and lower prices) for at least some portion of their
winter supplies. As a result, unlike in eastern markets,
a much larger proportion of the supply portfolio of
California utilities will be exposed to the current
price spikes.

* No alternatives. A lack of fuel-switching capability
prevents a meaningful demand response to higher gas
prices. Power prices continue to move in lockstep with
the increase in gas prices. Not surprisingly, gas prices
pushed the cost of gas-fired generation beyond the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC's) proposed
price cap of $150 per megawatt-hour, setting the stage
for a reassessment of this price limit. A small and
declining portion of power generators are liquid fuel
capable. Significantly, air emissions restrictions-
already plaguing power markets with much higher
emissions credit costs this year-will make any further
switching to liquid fuels in the crucial California
market highly unlikely this winter. A recent meeting of
the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which
has jurisdiction over the Los Angeles area, concluded
with no relief granted to generators running short of
emissions credits.

Market Forces Unite for Price Spikes During November
The first cold weather-related demand spike demonstrated
the combined power of these forces and the vulnerability
of the western markets. A cold weather system in mid-
November brought temperatures averaging 47 percent
colder than normal-the temperatures actually averaged 14
percent colder than a normal January week-and provided
the additional demand boost that taxed the gas delivery
systems on the West Coast. Capacity constraints on
moving gas into California that appeared during the
summer extended north into the Pacific Northwest as
heating loads climbed. This core demand compounded the
effects of continued strong demand for gas for power
generation.

The high power demand was the result of the intersection
of the annual low point for hydroelectric generation and
a series of planned and unplanned nuclear and coal power
plant outages. Gas demand in the US West during the last
two weeks of November was boosted to approximately 15.5
Bcf per day, driven by heating demand increases of 2.8
Bcf per day above normal levels and power plant outage-
related demand increases of 1.0 Bcf per day.

These demand spikes caused buyers-already dependent on
the spot market-to bid citygate prices to record high
levels through the last two weeks of November and into
December. Since demand outstripped supply, prices rose
dramatically at all western price points, and flows of
natural gas to western markets increased over high
summer levels. Citygate prices surged beyond $40.00 per
MMBtu on daily spot markets and averaged nearly $15.00
per MMBtu for December bidweek at Topock. Daily spot gas
prices have reflected imbalance penalty prices in many
western market regions.

West Coast to Remain Disconnected Through the Winter
Although the week of November 13 could prove to be the
peak demand week in the West this winter, CERA does not
expect any significant retreat in gas prices on the West
Coast any time soon. Storage inventories are so low that
the ability to beat back demand spikes with high storage
withdrawals is not an option for gas utilities.
Generators, which already rely heavily on the spot
market for supplies, are faced with a bidding war for
scarce supplies. Colder-than-normal weather would likely
keep West Coast prices in the $20.00-$40.00 per MMBtu
range. More normal weather would allow a slow decline
from current levels of over $20.00 per MMBtu down into
the $15.00-$20.00 per MMBtu range. However, the storage
situation and underlying demand strength mean that any
return to a lower pricing range is unlikely until early
January.

This winter will prove a critical test for western gas
markets, and the end of the heating season will likely
provide the first opportunity for lower price levels in
the West Coast market. As heating loads diminish
significantly in March and storage deliverability is no
longer a critical issue, premiums should retreat back
into the $1.00-$2.00 per MMBtu range. As hydroelectric
generation begins to increase, the pressure could
subside even further, but storage injections during the
spring shoulder season will likely limit price declines
even during the spring.

The Unique Vulnerability of the Pacific Northwest
The West Coast price pressure is not limited to
California. High demand in the Pacific Northwest (and
more indirectly in California) will keep upward pressure
on prices from Sumas to Stanfield. Northwest pipeline
capacity from the Rockies was already fully utilized at
the onset of the cold weather and even so can only
provide gas so far into the Pacific Northwest. The
combined California and Pacific Northwest demand pushed
Stanfield up in spite of the limited volumes that are
bidirectional there. The only supply source for the load
centers in southern British Columbia and even more so in
northern Pacific Northwest (such as Seattle) are from
Westcoast at Sumas. The Westcoast mainline from the
producing fields in Northeast British Columbia has also
been operating at capacity. The same bidding forces felt
in California have been evident at these western
Canadian price points, pushing Sumas prices into the
$20s per MMBtu. These forces will persist, keeping Sumas
at a premium to AECO over the winter-and in much closer
relationship to California prices.

Customer Response:  Another Log on the Backlash Bonfire
With power plants and gas utilities paying the current
high spot prices, consumers' bills from Vancouver to San
Diego will ultimately reflect these high commodity
prices. The gas industry has been preparing for rate
shock this winter, warning regulators and customers
alike. However, the price spikes in the West and the
sustained premiums in western markets move beyond
alarming. Capacity holders are reaping significant
rewards for their investments in capacity positions,
resulting in a substantial transfer of wealth from
consumers to capacity holders. Market power and market
gaming accusations that have hit the power markets will
find easy application in their gas market counterpart
(no matter what their merits). Some level of
investigation into the natural gas markets during or
following this challenging winter should be expected. As
has occurred in the power markets, this will now turn
attention to gas purchasing practices, particularly in
California. The likely outcome of this process will be a
shift away from the heavy reliance on spot purchases
toward a more flexible portfolio approach.

I've looked into whether we can terminate our Val Verde interconnect 
agreement with Burlington, and have determined we may do so only if we take 
the following steps:

1.  Terminate the OBA by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.  Paragraph 13 
of the 6/1/94 OBA with Burlington (as successor in interest to Meridian) 
provides that either party may terminate the OBA "at the end of the primary 
term, or thereafter by providing thirty (30) days prior written notice" to 
Burlington.  (The one-month primary term ended June 30, 1994 and has since 
gone month-to-month.)

2.  On the effective termination date of the OBA, terminate the interconnect 
agreement by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.    The 12/31/92 
Interconnect Point Operating Agreement, Paragraph 6, provides that either 
party may terminate on 180 prior notice after expiration of the primary 
term.  This is of limited use to us since the primary term does not expire 
until 12/31/02.  However, the paragraph also provides that the agreement "may 
be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in 
the event the OBA between the parties is terminated."

As we've already discussed, termination of the agreement is an extreme 
measure from a customer relations standpoint and we probably need to weigh 
our other options first.  Let me know if you have further questions.

from NGI's Daily Gas Price Index Dec 13, 2000 

In an attempt to capture the price discovery offered in the rapidly expanding 
electronic exchange market, NGI is adding a new price report to its website. 
"NGI's Electronic Platform Trading Index" will be comprised of deals done 
each morning before 11:30 a.m. Central Time and will be published on its 
website at http://intelligencepress.com by 1 p.m. Central Time each business 
day. 

The new service starts today with independently-audited quotes from 
EnronOnline. NGI is actively soliciting quotes from other exchanges, which 
will be added as they become available. NGI will compile an index (NGIX) from 
the data submitted. To become part of the exchange index, please contact 
Dexter Steis at 703-318-8848. 

NGI will continue to publish the results of its own extensive price surveys, 
which include both off-line and online transactions. The separate publication 
of the electronic indices is intended as a supplement to provide information 
on the rapidly growing exchange trading in a timely manner. The electronic 
exchange indices will be available on NGI's website at mid-day and also will 
be printed in the next day's NGI's Daily Gas Price Index.

USGT
Sold 20,000 MMBtu/d of Daily Firm space moving gas for the weekend from PG&E 
Topock to SoCal Needles at $.10/MMBtu.  This was somewhat of a novel deal in 
that the California price spreads opened up and gas became trapped at PG&E.  
Once our station 4 compressor becomes fully operational, this opportunity 
will likely dry up.  

Enron N.A.
Representatives contacted us this week to discuss our possible participation 
in a gas storage field using a depleted reservoir on Navajo land near 
Farmington, NM.  Third party developers approached ENA looking for assistance 
in moving the project forward.

New Tariff Services
Marketing consensus was reached to delay any further development of 
Transwestern's Hourly Firm Service until the potential markets of power plant 
loads become operational.  During this interim period, Park 'n Ride services 
provided on an intra-day basis shall be priced incrementally higher than Park 
'n Ride services provided on a timely basis.  Any resulting market response 
will provide indications of market willingness to pay premium transport rates 
for hourly transportation service.

El Paso 
El Paso Merchant Services needs to re-scrub their verbal offer to 
Transwestern of a $15 Million lump sum "pre-payment" option of fuel 
monetization for their combined 65,000 MMBtu/d of San Juan to California 
capacity.  El Paso did not take into consideration the different termination 
dates of the two contracts (25,000 MMBtu/d PG&E permanent release contract, 
and 40,000 MMBtu/d Gallup expansion contract) in their analysis.  A revised 
proposed lump sum payment offer is expected mid-next week.

El Paso Field Services
Met with EP representatives to discuss a possible interconnect near WT-1.  
The I/C would be sized for 40,000 MMBtu/d.  EP proposes to pay for and set 
compression to flow this gas into our high pressure line and has agreed to a 
volume commitment of 20,000 MMBtu/d for up to 2 years.  An added advantage is 
most of the volume would come from the constrained Atoka area which would 
allow Agave to increase deliveries to TW.

Caithness Corp.
Caithness has decided to move forward on their 1000 Mw generation project in 
Northwest Arizona.  The 2-phase project would initially consume 80,000 
MMBtu/d of gas.  The proposed location is 40 miles south of TW's line near 
Wickieup, AZ.  We are meeting with Caithness reps next week.  Projected 
in-service date for the plant is early 2002.

WT-2 Cooler Expansion
Level B cost estimates are being prepared.  Revenue / cost savings 
assumptions predict $500,000 annual revenue to support the expenditure.  Once 
installed, the project would give TW an additional 50,000 MMBtu/d capacity on 
the east end.  Financial evaluations will be done once the cost estimate is 
received.

The Commission issued a draft order in Docket No. RP00-249 today accepting 
TW's tariff sheets to acquire offsystem capacity on PNM, effective Sept. 15, 
subject to the following conditions:

The tariff sheets are accepted for a 2-year period subject to TW's refiling 
within 15 days of the order to 1) limit its acquisition to a max. of 40,000 
MMBtu/day and 2) to limit the firm service to the non-peak summer period.  
Also, TW must file a report with the Commission at the end of the 2-year 
period detailing what impact, if any, the proposal has had on the market.  
After the report is filed, parties may comment on the report.

We agreed to the 40,000 MMBtu limit but not to the non-peak period or the 
20-year limit.  Let's discuss whether we should seek rehearing of the order.

Note:  Raymond James and Associates is predicting gas prices to average $4.50

are now averaging $3.85 for 2001.  Read on to hear what the brokerage houses 
are predicting. Lorna

Raymond James Sends Chills Up Gas Buyers' Spines

Raymond James and Associates gave gas buyers a Halloween shriek yesterday 
that could be producing chills all the way through next April, perhaps even 
all of next year. The firm released a chilly forecast of double digit gas 
prices this winter and said it expects prices to average $4.50/MMBtu in 2001. 

"Regardless of a potentially warm winter, it is highly likely that the United 
States will experience regional shortfalls in gas supply," Raymond James said 
in its latest energy report. "In other words, gas storage should test 
all-time low levels this winter regardless of weather. 

"The situation should get worse, not better, next year. If we end the winter 
at all-time low storage levels and we cannot inject more gas next summer than 
we did this summer, then we should enter next winter with dangerously low 
levels of natural gas," Raymond James added. 

"We believe that the United States will see gas demand increase by about 9 
Bcf/d (or 15%) by the end of 2002 as new gas fired electric generation plants 
come on line. Unfortunately, even if every drilling rig is working, U.S. gas 
supply is likely to increase by less than 4 Bcf/d by the end of 2002. This 
means that gas prices must rise sufficiently to crimp over 5 Bcf/d of demand 
out of the gas supply/demand equation by 2002. At $5/Mcf, only about 1.5 
Bcf/d of demand has been reduced so far. That means that gas prices must go 
higher over the next several years." 

However, Raymond James' bullish predictions are a far cry above the crowd on 
Wall Street. Plenty of other analysts have upped their forecasts recently to 
hair-raising levels. The First Call consensus for 2001 now is up to 
$3.85/MMBtu. But that's still 65 cents less than the Raymond James's 
prediction. 

Not everyone wants to scare the daylights out of buyers, however. Deutsche 
Bank believes analysts and the futures market participants at Nymex "are 
getting bold and in our view maybe too bold." 

"With the natural gas rig count approaching 850, it is hard to believe that 
there will not be a fairly substantial supply response in 2001," Deutsche 
Bank said in its Energy Wire on Friday. "Analysts at the U.S. Energy 
Information Administration are expecting dry gas production to rise to 18.94 
Tcf (51.9 Bcf/d) in 2001, after being stuck at near 18.7 Tcf (51.2 Bcf/d) for 
several years. Our own estimate for 2001 looks for 19.1 Tcf (52.3 Bcf/d) and 
we have seen credible forecasts reaching as high as 19.7 Tcf (54 Bcf/d). In 
general we think the EIA is way too conservative and that our own number is 
more likely to be adjusted higher rather than lower. A gain in domestic 
production of 2 Bcf/d to 53.2 Bcf/d could be doable. Imports appear likely to 
be up 0.5 Bcf/d. If demand rises by 2.5%, that would account for about a 1.5 
Bcf/d gain. All other things equal, this implies that storage can refill and 
suggests that prices are going to come under some downward pressure."

Although I have turned over the capacity tracking spreadsheet duty to 
Michelle (who has eagerly accepted), I still maintain another spreadsheet of 
the long term FT agreements which the options are tracked on.  It might be a 
good idea for the transport options to be tracked on both spreadsheets.

After canceling last week's Unauthorized Overpull Penalty situation Friday 
(see Daily GPI, Nov. 13), El Paso reinstated the OFO Monday until further 
notice. The Window Rock (AZ) B Station was brought back partially online late 
Saturday afternoon, causing the previous 250 MMcf/d reduction of North 
Mainline capacity to fall to 150 MMcf/d. That level of constraint will remain 
in effect until the next block of compression becomes available sometime this 
week, the pipeline said.

Note:  The market reaction is interesting.  One can surmise that quite a bit 
of the gas that was contracted for on Vector is 
firm utility gas.  The run up in Chicago may be temporary until alternate 
arrangements are completed.

Vector Delay Confirms Market's Suspicions

Future shippers on the new Chicago-to-Dawn Vector Pipeline had their fears 
confirmed Tuesday when pipeline officials announced that the start-up date 
for the project, which was scheduled for Nov. 1 to coincide with the start-up 
of the long-awaited Alliance Pipeline, would be delayed until Dec. 1. 

Vector officials blamed the delay on the excessive rainfall that has hampered 
construction of the pipeline, which --- when completed --- would provide 
initial takeaway for about 700 MMcf/d of the 1.3 Bcf/d of western Canadian 
gas that will be shipped to the Chicago market by Alliance. Alliance is due 
to begin operations on Oct. 31. 

The announcement yesterday left many in the market asking the million-dollar 
question: "where will that [Alliance] gas go?" in the meantime. Alliance 
officials noted the line has connections with existing pipelines and LDCs 
serving the Chicago hub that could pick up the slack between Oct. 31 and Dec. 
1. 

Alliance's Jack Crawford downplayed the impact of the Vector start-up delay 
on Alliance. "We don't think [there will be] much effect at all. We have been 
working closely with Vector. Our connection with them, if it's not ready, is 
very close. We also have five other connections with other [existing] 
pipelines and LDCs" in Chicago. Many shippers "understand [that with ] a 
startup the magnitude of ours [Alliance] and Vector's, there are likely to be 
some bumps at beginning." 

Immediate market reaction to the news was somewhat unexpected. The Chicago 
basis for November widened from a plus 9.5-10 to plus 11-12 Tuesday following 
Vector's announcement. That is contradictory to what you would think would 
occur, said a Chicago trader for a large marketing company. "I was offering 
index-plus gas today betting on the chance that will come off by the time 
bidweek rolls around," he said. The effect on the market wasn't as profound 
as some would have thought, agreed another trader. "In fact, Chicago prices 
actually strengthened on the news. You would think that with the excess gas 
on the market starting Nov 1, the basis would have come off. The only thing I 
can think is that people are betting on cold weather showing up in the 
Chicago market on Nov. 1 as well." 

Meanwhile Dawn prices, which one would have expected to strengthen following 
the news, did so, as November basis widened from low 30s to plus 36 yesterday 
following the announcement, a Michigan trader said. 

The Vector Pipeline would transport much of the Alliance gas from the market 
hub in Chicago to the hub at Dawn, ON, as well as provide access to markets 
and storage in the upper Midwest. The line eventually will carry 1 Bcf/d, but 
its initial start-up delivery capacity will be 700 MMcf/d. The pipeline is 
slated to serve key markets in Ontario, Quebec, and the U.S. Midwest and 
Northeast. 

~Vector shippers were notified of the delay along with the rest of the market 
Tuesday, although many already had suspected the pipeline wouldn't be able to 
adhere to its scheduled start-up date. At an LDC forum in Chicago a few weeks 
ago, a spokesman for Vector insisted the pipeline was on schedule, but then 
sources said he showed pictures of parts of the pipeline underwater. "Folks 
who were there knew what that meant." 

Presently, more than 90% of the Vector line has been installed and progress 
on the Springville compressor station is on schedule, according to the 
company. The Dec. 1 start-up date includes adequate time for any further 
weather impacts and for the extensive commissioning and testing programs 
necessary, it said, adding Vector is scheduled to begin filling the system in 
late October to complete the commissioning of facilities. 

Sponsors of Vector include Calgary-based Enbridge Inc. with a 45% interest; 
Westcoast Energy Inc. of Vancouver, BC, with a 30% interest; and 
Detroit-based MCN Energy Group Inc. with a 25% interest.

Dear CERA Members and Friends: 

Are oil companies leaving money on the table in their use of benchmark crude 
prices?? What can be done to lower the risk in these potentially harmful 
calculations?

One of Cambridge Energy Research Associates' (CERA) core businesses has been 
benchmark crude oil price analysis. In our new multiclient study, "The Hole 
in the Barrel", CERA goes beyond our benchmark price analyses to analyze the 
structure of the market itself.? We argue the limits and real economic losses 
that can result from misunderstanding these prices - specifically the Brent 
benchmark - in oil company financial calculations and strategic planning, the 
magnitude of which can be significant, often amounting to dollars - not cents 
- per barrel.

As an introduction to this new study, we would like to invite you to 
participate in this complementary multimedia conference call and web 
presentation on October 12, 2000.? With the current volatility and high 
levels of energy prices, this conference call will bring clarity to these 
important and relevant issues.

To enroll for the call, please RSVP to 1-800-289-0579 or 719-457-2550 and 
reference the Confirmation Code 984848 in order to participate in the call.

In this detailed study, CERA looks at what people really mean when they talk 
about the oil price.? As part of the study, we: 

* Analyze each of the five contracts that make up the Brent market and 
consider their long-term future given the steady decline of "wet" barrels, 
including how other price markers might evolve.

* Outline how oil companies have more discretion to raise revenues (for a 
given volume of production) than is generally appreciated.

* Examine each of the three components that make up oil prices (absolute 
price level, time and grade differentials), to show where revenue is being 
lost and what can be done to add it back again.

* Assess the management control issues associated with any market activity 
and conclude that the risks of dealing are significant but not overwhelming, 
especially in comparison to the underlying and increasing price risk that 
they help to manage.

In this evolving New World, while trading may or may not be good for you, not 
understanding the market can be fatal. 

CONFERENCE CALL TOPICS: 
* Brent Blend as a price benchmark for a significant proportion of 
internationally traded crude oils. 
* The fitness for purpose of each of the five interwoven but separate 
contracts in the Brent market to different sectors of the oil industry 

* The risks and rewards of dealing in the Brent market 

Our speakers will address this topic for 20-30 minutes, with accompanying 
graphics presented on the Internet, followed by an open question and answer 
period.

SPEAKERS: 
Tim Fitzgerald, Senior Director 
Liz Bossley, Senior Associate 
Ann-Louise Hittle, Senior Director, World Oil 
Julian West, Senior Director, Energy & e-Business

Williams to Expand Kern River by 124,500 Dth/d

Kern River Gas Transmission, a subsidiary of Williams, said it planned on 
filing an application yesterday with FERC to add 124,500 Dth/d of additional 
firm transportation capacity to its 922-mile pipeline system. The company 
said the California Expansion Project will not only provide additional 
natural gas capacity from Wyoming to markets in California, but also will 
provide an opportunity for Williams to offer significantly reduced rates for 
firm transportation based on the recent approval by FERC of Kern River's 
Extended Term Rate Program. 

"A combination of rapid growth and the development of new gas-fired power 
generation facilities in California is fueling expansion of the system," said 
Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River and Northwest 
Pipeline. 

The project includes construction of three new compressor stations, an 
additional compressor at an existing facility in Wyoming, restaging a 
compressor in Utah, and upgrading two meter stations. Kern River said the $80 
million project is targeted to be complete by May 1, 2002. 

The company said demand for firm transportation on Kern River was driven by 
several factors: the diversion of Canadian gas supplies to markets in the 
Midwest from the Pacific region; increased production in the Rocky Mountain 
basin; strong economic growth in Kern River's market areas; and increased 
demand from gas-fired electric generation facilities. 

Williams said it anticipates holding an open season later this year to 
determine the level of market interest in a second expansion of the Kern 
River pipeline. "The demand for competitively priced transportation to 
markets in Nevada and California continues to grow. At the same time, gas 
producers in the Rocky Mountain basin are stepping up production. An 
expansion on Kern River in 2003 could help bring that production to market," 
said Morgan.

Prudential Sees Bull Market Running Two More Years

With gas futures prices soaring past $5, now is not a bad time to raise price 
forecasts and expectations for the coming winter and next year. Prudential 
Securities did just that yesterday, upping its predictions on spot wellhead 
prices to $4.10 for the second half of the year, $3.55 for all of 2000 and 
$3.65 for 2001. 

"[W]e believe the natural gas industry could continue its bullish run for 
another two years or more and the next 18 months look like a 'lay up,'" the 
investment banking firm said in its latest quarterly report on natural gas 
fundamentals. Below average storage inventories and increasing gas-fired 
electric generation demand should keep the bull market running, the report 
stated. 

Prudential expects storage to end the injection season at about 2,660 Bcf, or 
11% below last year's level. "This is assuming that the average injection 
rate is at or above the eight-year historical average during that period, and 
so far this year refills have been at or below the historical average. 
Depending on the winter weather, the industry typically consumes 2,000-2,500 
Bcf out of storage inventories, which would likely bring storage levels down 
close to record lows next spring." 

Prudential expects supply tightness to continue even with the addition of the 
1.325 Bcf/d Alliance project, which is due to come on line next month. "[W]e 
question whether the Alliance pipeline will add incremental supplies to the 
U.S. or simply displace gas supply out of the Alberta region currently 
flowing down the TransCanada pipeline system." Prudential predicts Alliance 
will open up Oct. 2 with 600-700 MMcf/d of gas flowing. "The perception of 
the continued tightness in the gas supply picture is likely to result in an 
increase in volatility in natural gas prices." 

Prudential also estimates that 1.5 Bcf/d of gas demand has been added this 
summer by new gas-fired power plants going on line. "Over the past few weeks, 
over 2,400 MW of new merchant capacity has been added to the grid, equating 
to about 480 MMcf/d of capacity. Earlier in the summer, 3,600 MW came on line 
and another 1,780 MW started up in May. In aggregate, about 7,800 MW of new 
summer generation load could collectively consume 1.5 Bcf/d, which is likely 
to be diverted from storage injections." 

The firm estimates that wellhead deliverability will pick up significantly. 
The rig count has grown 48% since last year. Production from the deep-water 
Gulf of Mexico is expected to add 3.6-4 Bcf/d of new supply, "more than 
offsetting the deliverability decline, but shy of total expected new demand. 
We forecast gas demand will rise 3.1% in 2001, fueled by growth in merchant 
power generation." 

Prudential noted that on the books is another 37,000 MW of additional new 
gas-fired generation capacity to be installed next year and 43,200 MW in 
2002.

Kinder Morgan Transfers $300M in Assets to MLP

Kinder Morgan, Inc. announced plans to contribute $300 million in assets to 
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P., the company's master limited 
partnership. The largest asset to be contributed is Kinder Morgan Texas 
Pipeline, formerly MidCon Texas, a 2,600-mile natural gas pipeline system 
that extends from South Texas to Houston along the Texas Gulf Coast. 

Other assets include the Casper and Douglas Gas Gathering and Processing 
Systems, KMI's 50% interest in Coyote Gas Treating and KMI's 25% interest in 
Thunder Creek Gas Services. As consideration for the assets, KMI will receive 
$300 million, 50% in cash and 50% in KMP partnership units. KMI expects the 
transaction to be completed in the fourth quarter. 

"This transaction represents a true win-win for both KMI and KMP," said 
Kinder Morgan CEO Rich Kinder. "It is expected to be accretive to cash 
available for distribution to KMP's unitholders by between 5-10 cents in 
2001. The pipeline assets are a good fit for KMP because they complement 
existing KMP assets, have long-term contracts in place and offer significant 
growth opportunities." Kinder noted that because the mix of consideration 
paid will include equity issued to KMI, it will not be necessary to raise 
funds for the transaction via a public offering of KMP units. 

"KMI will also benefit from the transaction, as it will be able to reduce its 
debt by $150 million," Kinder said. "Additionally, the transaction is 
expected to be modestly accretive to KMI's earnings per share in 2001. By 
increasing its stake in the master limited partnership, KMI will enjoy 
greater participation in the expected future growth of KMP." 

Upon closing, KMP will have completed in excess of $600 million of 
acquisitions in 2000. In addition, this transaction will boost KMI's total 
asset contribution to KMP to more than $1 billion, far exceeding the original 
goal stipulated when Kinder Morgan merged with KN Energy last July.

Due to a compressor failure at its Riner Station, Williams declared a force 
majeure situation on 
Line Segments 490 and 491. Necessary repairs are expected to be completed by 
next Monday's 
gas day. Since capacity in the two segments has been reduced, maintenance 
originally scheduled 
for the week of Aug. 21 at the Cheyenne and Ogallah Stations will be done 
this week to minimize 
disruptions during August, Williams said.

Edison Charges Gas Market Manipulation

Southern California Edison filed a motion late last week with the California 
Public Utility Commission seeking emergency relief from high spot gas prices 
on which its power purchase rates are based. The company told the CPUC that 
Southern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices in the last month have risen 
by $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market manipulation, in particular the 
withholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the 
supply basins and the California border. 

"[T]here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential 
has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse, 
collusion and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers and 
merchants," Edison told the CPUC. 

The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC 
regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of "certain allegedly 
collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gas 
suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas 
prices by wrongfully withholding capacity." It notes the complaint 
"conservatively estimates that the anti-competitive manipulation of the basis 
differential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by $100 
million annually since the beginning of 1998." 

Edison seeks an expedited order authorizing it to use the posted gas price of 
$4.5133/MMBtu, which was applied to SCE's August 2000 avoided cost posting, 
to calculate its payment obligations to qualified power producers for the 
month of October and every month going forward. It estimated September 
bidweek border prices would average $7/MMBtu. If such prices were used in 
Edison's September avoided costs posting, its Transition Formula payments to 
certain independent power producers will be $29 million more than the month 
prior, the company told the CPUC. "No mechanism exists to recapture the 
increase in such payments if it is later determined by this commission or in 
another forum that the Topock border indices are unreliable at this time."

Michelle:

The intial agreement Bob presented to EOG was for $10,000, this was to cover 
the cost to refurbishing the existing 6" tap.  The work order was generated 
with this amount so that the R-O-W folks would intiate a Landowner 
notification letter ASAP.  EOG estimated a 5 - 15 mmcfd volume and they were 
to supply all materials to re-activate this point.   A scope change was 
intiated and we were to supply the EFM for their meter tube,  a verbal cost 
estimate to Bob in the amount of $35,000 was relayed.  A third scope change 
raised the volume estimate to over 20 mmcfd, which normally means we install 
additional instrumentation.  Operations at this time insisted we add the 
needed equipment to the work order.  The E&C folks then put out the tighter 
cost estimate of $422,000.  This included the following cost revisions:

 Chromatograph     $55,000
 H2O Monitor     $10,000
 H2S Monitor     $35,000
 EFM      $35,000
 Flow control     $34,000
 Positive shut-in     $22,000
 Flow bypass     $12,000
 Engi. CSUP, Contig.  $120,000
 Tax Gross-up   $100,000 
  Total   $423,000

Michelle is it possible to evaluate a park-n-ride in deal profitability?  If 
not would this be valuable?  If it would be Mei-Ling and I would like to meet

Effective immediately, reporting responsibility for Global Strategic Sourcing 
(GSS) will move from Enron Net Works to Enron Corp.  George Wasaff, Managing 
Director, will report directly to Rick Causey, Executive Vice President and 
Chief Accounting Officer for Enron.  GSS, formed February 1, 2000, will 
continue to focus on supply-chain management world-wide for Enron.   We 
believe this change in reporting will leverage and enhance GSS's global reach 
and effectiveness while allowing ENW to focus on its core mission of creating 
new electronic market places.

Subject: TW Options Pre-Filing Meetings With FERC Today


I think we had really good meetings today with both FERC rates & policy 
staff.  Jeff and the whole team did an excellent job of drawing them into the 
discussion.  By the end of both sessions I thought that they seemed genuinely 
interested in the proposal and anxious to see the filing.  Mike Coleman went 
so far as to suggest that to the extent we can make the case the this will be 
a tool in the generation siting process, we would be helping his group with 
Chairman Hoecker's directive for staff to develop concepts to respond to the 
SW power crunch.   

Attendees
Rates/Tariff Group Attendees (OMTR Rates West):  Mike Coleman, Bob 
Petrocelli, John Carlson
Policy Group Attendees:  Ed Murrell,  Laurel Hyde, Kim Bruno, Kathleen Dias & 
Demi Pulas 

Things They Liked
Service/Rate Structure.  They seemed to like the fact that the underlying 
agreement is an FT and fact that the transaction remained subject to current 
rate provisions.
Open bidding for shipper calls
We will only sell call options when we have available capacity
The underlying FT and the option amendment can be released to another shipper 
through capacity release 

Concerns that Need to Be Addressed in the Filing
Concentration of capacity/hoarding/affiliate issues.  Mike Coleman said that 
we need to address this issue head on in light of El Paso/CPUC cases.  They 
are worried that huge block of future capacity rights could be tied up by a 
single offering.  On the other hand, he said that perhaps we can use this 
filing as an opportunity to explain how our bidding on shipper calls adds 
improved transparency and protections.  One possible way to address this is 
to promise that the time frame for posting/bidding on shipper calls will 
depend on the size of the block.  (e.g. a 20 M/D package might involve a day 
bidding process, a 100 M/D block may involve a week posting).
Demonstrate that puts/calls don't undercut the release market.  Explain that 
release is used for day to day decisions, while we believe options will serve 
to help shippers with longer term strategic decision.
Be specific about any waivers of the part 284 regulations.
Work on the definition of the 4 options types.  They stumbled over some of 
the wording, like the use of phrase "recall" in the transporter call.


Detailed Notes
We had a surprisingly positive reception from Rates West.  This could be due 
in part to Mike Coleman's reputed continued interest on the electric side and 
his self-proclaimed corporate bent.  He did say that he understands the 
underlying business drivers for this program  and suggested that a flushed 
out narrative with the filing to explain these would help our efforts. He 
said that the timing on this type of offering is good now, as the Chairman is 
pressuring Staff to improve the marketplace (the California situation again).

Both groups suggested that we needed to lay out as much detail as possible in 
the filing, including examples of each type of options.  

As Mike delineated and we expected, the major issues that may cause 
discomfort are affiliate abuse and capacity hoarding (cornering the market 
under a long-term option) or speculative capacity holding.  To defend the 
service, we should lay out the impacts and explain why this offers an 
improvement over our present situation (discounted firm).  

Some Specific Questions from the Rates group included:
 How does this impact capacity release
 How does TW protect against hoarding
 Why aren't all options considered negotiated rates. 
 Are options tradable alone (without capacity)
 Would the availability of options change the volume of capacity held by ENA
 How are ROFRs affected
 
Some Specific Questions from the Policy group included:
 What are discriminating parameters/business decisions in allocating capacity
 How are competing offers allocated when in excess of available capacity
 How are options posted, bid on?  
 What are parameters of the options, specify range & degree of flexibility 
(explain whether strike dates are fixed) 
 What is the "trigger" or notice period for either a Call or Put; is it in 
the contract
 Is this a physical or financial product
 Does this verge into negotiated T&C territory?
 Is this like Koch's option proposal?  (No - Koch offers an option on price 
only)

Southwest Gas - SWG informed us this week they will most likely not be ready 
to receive gas from TW by the projected November 1 in-service date; the new 
date will probably be mid-month.  We will still invoice SWG for 
transportation under their firm contract beginning Nov. 1.  Also, upon 
inspection this week, TW engineering noticed SWG had installed a bypass-valve 
on their meter station at the new facility.  This bypass was not in the 
originally approved drawings.  TW's policy does not allow for a bypass unless 
the customer has a non-interruptible contract.  We are waiting for an 
explanation from SWG and will likely ask them to remove the extra pipe.

Transport Options Program - A meeting to brief FERC Staff about the program 
was held in Washington this week.  Overall, the filing received a very 
positive response.  Staff indicated the program would assist them with their 
directive to respond to the SouthWest power crunch.  Issues to address in the 
filing will be ways to mitigate potential affiliate abuse, capacity hoarding, 
and provide specific examples of the types of options.   We are still on 
track to make the FERC filing the week of October 9.

Agave Energy - Has agreed to purchase an additional 10,000 MMBtu/d firm on 
the Atoka lateral beginning 3/1/01.  The contract is a one-part rate of 
$.05/MMBtu for one year for deliveries east of Thoreau.

Note:  This interview with Jack Crawford of Alliance is probably the best 
information we have gained on the pipeline
operational start up and background information.  Vector may still be "iffy" 
for Dec. 1.  

Fingers Crossed, Alliance, Vector Shoot for Dec. 1
 
Alliance Pipeline informed its shippers yesterday that all debris has been 
cleared from the pipe, all connections are up and running, and that 
commercial service will begin on Dec. 1. Commercial service originally was 
expected to begin on Oct. 1 but was delayed several times because of 
commissioning problems . 

"We've tested all of our connections and we've been flowing volumes [to 
Midwestern LDCs] up to about half [663 MMcf/d] of what the pipeline is 
capable of transporting," said Alliance spokesman Jack Crawford. 

"We are asking our shippers today to provide forecasts to us of what they 
expect to do in the first month. The last time we did this the forecasts we 
got suggested that we'd be running at about 1.325 Bcf on the first day." 

One of the key questions remaining is whether Alliance's main downstream 
supply outlet, the 270-mile Vector Pipeline project, will be ready to go as 
well on Dec. 1. Vector had construction problems because of wet weather and 
also was forced to delay its start-up from Nov. 1.  The pipeline would 
transport 700 MMcf/d of gas initially from Joliet, IL, through Indiana and 
Michigan to Dawn, ON, but would be expanded to 1 Bcf/d next November. 

"The last I heard they were expecting to make [the deadline]," said Crawford. 
"We actually tested our meter with them over the weekend and it's all up and 
running, but that might be a subsequent event if they have a problem. It's 
been a challenge for them to get going, but it looks like they are all ready 
to go." 

A Vector spokesman confirmed that commissioning is going smoothly and 
operations appear to be on schedule for Dec. 1 start-up. "Right now everybody 
still feels that Dec. 1 is doable," he said. "You might want to touch base 
again next week and see how it looks, but right now it looks like we're 
getting things pretty well wrapped up. 

"The last place where we've been completing work has been up in the Milford 
and Highland Townships in Oakland County, MI. That's the area just before we 
go in the portion of the pipeline that we're leasing from Michigan 
Consolidated Gas Co. As of last Friday, they still hadn't reached that area 
with linepack [gas]." 

Crawford said the Aux Sable liquids plant also is up and running, and 
previous pipeline coordination difficulties have been ironed out. "They are 
still bringing it up to full scale. They are short both volume and heat 
content at the moment and that's by design. The pipeline is flowing at about 
half volume at the moment, and in addition to that we've been running lean 
test gas." 

Farther upstream, Alliance still has one lateral, the Peace River Lateral, 
that will be delayed because of the impact of wet summer weather on 
construction. "It will be up and running perhaps not by Dec. 1 but in a week 
or two. It's an eight and 10-inch line. It's relatively small," he said. 

Once the massive new pipeline is running smoothly, the next steps to be taken 
include potential connections with several proposed pipelines in and around 
Chicago, including potentially the Guardian, Horizon and Whitecap Energy 
projects. 

"We also looked at a couple of other receipt connections on the upstream 
side," said Crawford. "We've obviously talked about a potential expansion in 
the future, but as we found out by talking to people it looks like the supply 
additions in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin have not been as brisk as 
we might have thought, probably because of the downturn in the oil price a 
couple of years ago. It's likely that an expansion would be delayed for a 
year or two or even three. 

"The best that I've been able to ascertain from talking to people is that our 
supply deliverability really has not increased very much in the last two to 
three years, and as a consequence at least in the short run the gas on our 
system will end up coming out of other systems." 

He also mentioned that TransCanada is planning to take some of its capacity 
out of service, including retiring some older compressors and rewheeling 
others, in order to reduce the amount of excess pipeline capacity in the 
Canadian gas market.

Distributed Power: The Next Big Investment?
 
With today's electricity demand expanding beyond the reach of available 
supply, and nationwide electric deregulation efforts providing inconsistent 
results, distributed power just may be the next big thing, according to Bear 
Stearns analyst Robert Winters. 

With technology-laden, electricity-hungry companies popping up every time you 
turn around, and blackouts and brownouts occurring more frequently as large 
power grids are becoming less reliable, the analyst points towards 
distributed energy services as a possible solution, and maybe the "next big 
investment opportunity for the coming decade." In Winters' 250 page report, 
"Distributed Energy Services-The World's Power and Transportation Industries: 
Set for a Revolution-Part 2," he examines technologies and companies within 
the distributed energy services sector that might be able to take advantage 
of the current situation. 

"Thanks to major technological advances and energy deregulation, a wave of 
new investment in the power industry has just begun. We believe that this 
coming era in the power industry could resemble the wave of investments which 
flooded into the telecommunications industry following the breakup of AT&T in 
the early 1980's," said Winters. 

"Companies and municipalities need to find ways to ensure the availability of 
high quality, reliable power," added Winters. According to his research, 
microturbines are the best positioned of the "new" technologies that would be 
able to have an immediate impact on electric generation. 

He based his recommendation on the fact that microturbines are small, quiet, 
efficient and very versatile. "They can be used as a main power source, a 
back-up power source or as an alternative when there is a spike in 
traditional energy prices," the analyst said. "Microturbines can also be used 
in remote locations, including developing countries, that do not have access 
to electricity." Another attractive feature of microturbines is their fuel 
requirements. The units often use natural gas, but can also use several other 
fuels as well. 

In the study, the analyst also examined fuel cells, flywheel technology, and 
existing reciprocating engines technologies such as diesel engines and 
Stirling engines, which he noted are enjoying a comeback. 

In addition to the report, Winters initiated coverage on two distributed 
energy companies. He labeled Active Power, a company that is pioneering 
flywheel technology, as a "buy" and Capstone Turbine Corp., a leading 
manufacturer of microturbines, as "attractive." The companies are in addition 
to two fuel cell companies he currently follows. Ballard Power is currently a 
buy, and Plug Power is rated neutral.

Kern River Open Season

Kern River is holding an open season through Aug. 18 to determine interest in 
year-round FT to Nevada 
and California and interest in capacity relinquishment by existing firm 
shippers. The pipeline said it can 
offer significantly reduced FT rates based on recent FERC approval of Kern 
River's Extended Term 
Rate Program (ET Program). Under ET Program, customers could receive a rate 
reduction from $0.64/Dth 
to approximately $0.42 under a 15-year contract. Because system expansion can 
be accomplished by the 
addition of compression facilities, it could result in an overall lowering of 
rolled-in rates for all shippers, Kern 
River said. Depending on open season results, the pipeline is proposing a 
mainline expansion of up to 500 
MMcf/d with an in-service target date of May 1, 2002. If goals can be met 
using relinquished capacity and no 
new facilities are required, new service could begin as early as Oct. 1, 
2001. Call Laurie Brown at 
(801) 584-6410 or Greg Snow at -7270 for more information. 


Panda Links to Transmission Grid for Gila Bend Plant

Panda Energy International inked a firm electrical transmission agreement 
with Arizona Public Service to 
supply power from its proposed natural gas-fired 2,000 MW plant to be located 
in the town of Gila Bend. The 
proposed plant is before the Arizona Corporation Committee for review. Senior 
vice president of merchant 
plant development for Panda, Garry Hubbard, said that the firm contract is "a 
critical step forward for the
plant." The new plant is on schedule to commence construction later this 
year, with start up 18 months later, 
he added. Powering the plant will be eight General Electric 7 FA natural gas 
turbines operating in combined 
cycle.

Note:  Alliance says they are flowing 40-50% of capacity at this time 
(400-500 MMBtu/d 
hitting the Chicago market).  It sounds like they have not yet been able to 
commission the
Aux Sable plant because of the trash gas they are still pushing through.  
Some predictors 
are saying the delay may get longer.

Alliance Service Delay Extended to End of November

Alliance Pipeline conceded yesterday that its commercial in-service date will 
have to be delayed for the third time, this time until the end of November, 
because of continued problems with debris in the pipe and trouble getting the 
enormously complex components of the system working in sync. The 1,900-mile 
project originally was supposed to be in service Oct. 1. 

"Normal commissioning activities are continuing and most of the debris has 
been removed from the line," says Alliance CEO Norm Gish. "However, periodic 
reductions in the flow of test gas due to the debris have complicated the 
required integration with concurrent commissioning activities at the Aux 
Sable Liquid Products processing facility near Chicago." A spokesman said the 
debris included "bits of foam" that came off equipment used to extract 
moisture following hydrostatic testing. 

The complexity of the Alliance Pipeline operations also has led some 
observers to predict a lengthy delay before commercial service. The pipeline 
has an immensely complicated system patented by Alliance engineers that is 
designed to transport gas liquids in a gas phase with the 1.325 Bcf/d of 
natural gas from British Columbia and northern Alberta through 1,900 miles of 
pipe to the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant near Chicago. The pipeline 
also incorporates a cutting edge electronic control system designed to allow 
the pipeline to be operated by a single pilot in a downtown Calgary control 
room. Alliance operators say they are actually operating three pipelines: a 
physical pipe, a paper pipe and an e-pipe, which brings all aspects of the 
operation together around the clock 365 days a year. "It's a tremendously 
complicated system and all the parts are interdependent, for it to work, they 
all have to work together." 

Regardless of the delay, however, Alliance already is flowing a large amount 
of gas into the Chicago market. "At this point in our commissioning 
activities, the system is flowing at approximately 40 to 50% of capacity. We 
expect to continue increasing the volume of test gas and approaching our firm 
delivery capacity of 37.5 million cubic meters (1.325 Bcf) per day prior to 
the end of November."

If possible, can we reschedule our meeting from Wednesday (10/4) to tomorrow 
at 1pm since I have completed TW invoice review this afternoon.  I am hoping 
to possibly take Wednesday off if I can shift my meetings.  Let me know if 
there's a conflict.  

Thanks,

This week, make sure you call all your customers (if you haven't already 
spoken with them) and discuss the non-binding open season.  Answer any 
questions they might have, and reiterate the response deadline.  See if you 
can get an idea if they plan on responding one way or the other.  

thanks

Changes in Enron's business require us to reevaluate how we approach the 
engineering and construction function within Enron.  Specifically,  Enron 
Energy Services' (EES) business has grown dramatically and that requires 
considerable additional engineering and construction resources both to 
develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers.  
Additionally, in light of Enron's continued emphasis on increasing our return 
on invested capital, we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction 
projects around the world.  Historically, these projects have been a primary 
focus of EECC's activities.  Consequently we are making the following 
organizational changes concerning EECC:

EECC's pipeline construction group, led by Jerry Martin, will become part of 
Enron Transportation Services.  
NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant 
construction services to Enron entities and third parties.
The remainder of EECC will become part of EES.  Larry Izzo will report to the 
EES Office of the Chairman.
 
 These changes will better align our intellectual capital with the growth 
opportunities within Enron and provide new and exciting opportunities for our 
employees.  Please join us in supporting and implementing these changes.

Michelle -- I am glad they finally fixed your name!   

You need to go under "Actions", Calendar Tools", "Calendar Profile" and under 
mail file owner go out to the address book and reselect your name.    

Page me if you have any questions.    Thanks, Jean 1-800-906-8093

The notes team has corrected her name from Michele to Michelle.  But as you 
can see in her letter head it still come up as Michele.
How do we change that.  I've reset up her notes from scratch to see if that 
corrected the problem.  
For the long run - should we just get corrected ID file from the Notes Team?

"A man with a new idea is a crank until he succeeds."
-Mark Twain

Innovation, itself, is nothing new.  The word comes to us from the Latin 
innovatus, which is a good indication of how long the concept has been 
around.  People have been searching for the "next big thing" for thousands of 
years.

We have quite a tradition of innovation here at Enron.  Although consistent 
innovation may sound like an oxymoron, we pride ourselves on consistently 
outpacing our peers with innovative ideas.

How do you think Enron can maintain its edge into the new century?  What will 
be our "next big thing?"  Put your best foot forward, visit eMeet and share 
your ideas in "Creativity and Innovation" that will keep Enron at the top.

With the implementation of SAP, the employee expense report form has been 
modified to reflect the new coding system.  The procedures for its use are 
unchanged, but there are some cosmetic differences.  One item to note: the 
form no longer requires entry of your Social Security Number; instead use 
your new personnel number assigned through Human Resources (see 
http://hrweb.enron.com).  For electronically submitted expense reports, enter 
the same number on the receipt envelope.

The form is now available at the SAP website.  To access the form:

 From the Enron home page, go to the SAP intranet site http://sap.enron.com
 Choose one of the following paths:
 Click on Quick Reference Tools on the left menu
  Click drop-down arrow for Accounts Payable Forms
  Click SAP Expense Report Form

  Click on Forms and Procedures Library on the left menu
  Click drop-down arrow for Accounts Payable Forms
  Click SAP Expense Report Form
 Wait for it to load
 Click Enable Macros (or Yes, allow macros)

After you enter the data, save as Excel Workbook (.xls file extension) with a 
new filename.  Do not save as Excel Template (.xlt extension).

You may print the spreadsheet for submission to Accounts Payable, or attach 
it to Notes for electronic submission.  Instructions are available at the 
website, on the same drop down box as the form.

If you have any questions, contact the Center of Expertise (COE) at 713 
345-7427.

News Brief:
+OGE Energy Corp.'s Enogex Subsidiary Sells Non-Core Assets

OGE Energy Corp. said its Enogex Inc. subsidiary has closed on the sale of
several assets no longer considered vital to its core business. These assets
include interests in oil and gas-producing properties in Utah and three
natural gas-gathering pipeline systems in Oklahoma. Terms of the
transactions were not disclosed. Proceeds from the asset sales, totaling
about $14 million, will be used to pay down short-term debt associated with
Enogex's 1999 acquisition of Transok LLC.

In Utah, Enogex sold all of its interests in its oil and gas properties,
along with all related rights, equipment, real property, leases and
agreements. In Oklahoma, Enogex sold the Piedmont and El Reno systems in
Canadian County and the Fidelity gathering system in Oklahoma County,
including all gathering lines, compressors and equipment along with related
contracts and rights of way.

The Oklahoma sale was to Seminole Gas Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Seminole Energy Services LLC of Tulsa.

We will need to keep reminding them of how much money they are making when 
they start to complain about the construction cost.  By the time we get power 
there, install the flow control equipment, and install the new EFM, we will 
probably be close to $70,000.

Note:  With Dynegy as anchor, NGPL is planning on building a lateral into St. 
Louis for the first time.  MRT (a Reliant pipeline)
has been the only pipeline into this market.  


NGPL Plans Lateral to Serve Illinois Power in St. Louis

Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) announced plans to build a new 
47-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline lateral into St. Louis to serve Illinois 
Power's gas distribution system. The $35 million project, which is anchored 
by a contract with Illinois Power affiliate Dynegy Marketing and Trade, will 
add at least 300,000 Dth/d of gas transportation capacity to the St. Louis 
market. 

"The pipeline project and related agreements ideally demonstrate our ongoing 
strategy to expand our natural gas pipeline services into growing markets 
currently not connected to NGPL and to increase throughput on our system by 
adding electric load to our extensive pipeline network," said Richard D. 
Kinder, CEO of Kinder Morgan Inc., the parent company of NGPL. 

The new lateral will extend from Centralia, IL, to a point on Illinois 
Power's gas distribution system in the East St. Louis market. The project is 
scheduled for completion in June of 2002. 

NGPL and Dynegy entered into a number of long-term, gas transportation and 
storage contracts, including a 10-year agreement effective June 1, 2002, 
which will provide Dynegy with 90,000 Dth/d of gas via the new pipeline. In 
addition, NGPL and Dynegy entered into various other firm transportation 
agreements totaling another 98,000 Dth/d of gas sourced from NGPL's Gulf 
Coast and Amarillo lines beginning as early as Dec. 1, 2000. 

The NGPL project effectively creates a new supplier for a geographical area 
that until now has been served by just one natural gas transportation company 
[Mississippi River Transmission], according to Larry F. Altenbaumer, 
president of Illinois Power. "This new connection to Illinois Power's system 
will help open competitive opportunities to natural gas customers in the 
metro east area of St. Louis. It not only provides for a new delivery point 
to service customers directly, but also to fuel electric generation in the 
area. 

"The 10-year agreement to provide firm transportation service to Dynegy 
provides us a solid anchor customer for the pipeline project," said Deb 
Macdonald, president of NGPL. NGPL intends to solicit expressions of interest 
from other shippers in December and January. The results of the open season 
will determine the final scope of the project. 

"With Dynegy as our anchor customer, we will build the new lateral into the 
St. Louis market regardless of whether we receive other expressions of 
interest," said Macdonald. "We anticipate a strong response, however, given 
the size of the market and the potential for additional gas-fired power 
generation." 

Interested shippers should contact Mark Menis, NGPL's director of business 
development, at (630) 691-3347.

The GPG Safety Declaration of Interdependence signed by all GPG pipeline=20
operations staff is our promise to each other that safety on the job is fir=
st=20
before all other concerns, that we will positively act to assure safe=20
practices. This Safety Advisory Bulletin No. 6 is issued to reinforce the=
=20
need for personal safety at all times and in all circumstances.

On April 12, a One-Call ticket was issued for the work being done adjacent =
to=20
one of GPG=01,s pipelines. The ticket did not identify GPG as having facili=
ties=20
in the area so GPG was not notified.=20

Sometime after April 12, a GPG employee observed a contractor working in th=
e=20
vicinity of an active pipeline. The employee located and marked the pipelin=
e=20
in the area where the contractor was working. On May 8, the contractor was=
=20
excavating approximately 75 to 100 feet downstream of the marked pipeline,=
=20
routing a water line, and uncovered a 12-inch pipeline that was assumed to =
be=20
abandoned. The contractor was willing to incur the cost of removing a secti=
on=20
of the abandoned pipeline if the facility owner would ensure it was=20
abandoned.=20

The contractor requested a One-Call ticket to mark all underground faciliti=
es=20
in the area of the excavated 12-inch pipeline. GPG was notified, via fax, o=
f=20
the line locate request. The GPG employee who previously had located and=20
marked the pipeline informed the contractor that he was unaware of any=20
abandoned pipelines in the area, but that he would investigate further.  Th=
e=20
employee checked his pipeline drawings and consulted with other team member=
s=20
and learned that there was an abandoned pipeline in the area. Team members=
=20
also informed him that the accepted practice for checking abandoned pipelin=
es=20
was to drill into the pipe. =20

On May 9, the GPG employee entered the contractor's excavation and drilled=
=20
into what he assumed was the abandoned pipeline. The employee, believing th=
e=20
escaping medium was air, decided to let the pipe vent until the pressure=20
relieved. After two hours of venting and no noticeable reduction in pressur=
e,=20
the employee re-entered the excavation to check cathodic protection reading=
s.=20
At this point the employee determined that the drilled pipeline was venting=
=20
gas. Gas Control was informed of the situation and steps to shut-in, blow=
=20
down and repair the pipeline were implemented.   =20

After a thorough inquiry by the GPG Incident Investigation Team, the Senior=
=20
O&M Tech involved in the incident was disciplined as a result of his failur=
e=20
to follow the procedures listed below, and to reinforce the importance of=
=20
safety interdependency.=20

GPG Operating Procedures, 110.310, Gas Testing; 110.170 Confined Space Entr=
y;=20
110.260 Excavation; and 110.570 Work Permits :
No gas testing was done by the GPG employee to identify escaping medium.
No gas testing was done before the GPG employee entered the excavation=20
considered to be a permit entry confined space.
No gas testing was done before an ignition source was introduced into a=20
possibly hazardous atmosphere in the excavation.
No Confined Space Entry permit was issued when the employee re-entered the=
=20
excavation to take cathodic protection readings.
The employee entered an excavation with inadequate means of egress.
No hot work permits were issued by the employee.

GPG Operating Procedure, Blowdown and Purging 80.409 :
The employee did not communicate, in a timely manner, the planned blowdown =
to=20
residents of the adjacent neighborhood.

GPG Operating Procedure, Event Notification Sequence  10.101A :
Gas Control did not notify the GPG environmental specialist of the release =
of=20
natural gas.

GPG Environmental Procedure, Spills and Releases 2.1.10  :
The release of natural gas was not reported to the GPG Division Environment=

Specialist.

GPG Operating Procedure,  Damage Prevention 80.102 :  =20
The employee did not properly use maps when marking the pipeline.
The employee did not mark bends or other changes in the direction of the=20
pipeline.

PLEASE NOTE THE PRACTICE OF DRILLING INTO A PIPELINE TO DETERMINE IF IT IS=
=20
ABANDONED IS UNACCEPTABLE AND SHALL NOT BE UTILIZED.

Pre-existing abandoned pipe removal practice shall be as follows :

GPG employees shall contact local management when a pre-existing abandoned=
=20
pipeline must be removed to allow routing of other facilities. Local=20
management will contact the Engineering Department to evaluate the facility=
=20
and provide guidance to the team on how to proceed with pipeline=20
identification and the ensuing removal of the facility.=20

Abandoned pipelines that will not be removed shall be treated as an active=
=20
pipeline and marked in accordance with  GPG operating procedure 80.102

Moving Forward

The Pipeline Safety Department will review and revise GPG Operating Procedu=
re=20
80.102 to ensure that team members use all available resources to clearly=
=20
identify an existing pipeline as active or abandoned.

The GPG Pipeline Safety Department is investigating why the GPG facility wa=

PNM to Buy Electric Utility Operations of Western Resources

Public Service Company of New Mexico and Western Resources said that both
companies' boards of directors approved an agreement under which PNM will
acquire the Western Resources electric utility operations in a tax-free,
stock-for-stock transaction. Under terms of the agreement, PNM and Western
Resources, whose utility operations consist of its KPL division and KGE
subsidiary, will both become subsidiaries of a new holding company to be n
named at a future date. Prior to the consummation of this combination, 
Western Resources will reorganize all of its non-utility assets, including
its 85% stake in Protection One and its 45% investment in ONEOK, into 
Westar Industries which will be spun off to its shareholders.

Based on PNM's average closing price over the last 10 days, the indicated
equity value of the transaction is approximately $1.503 billion, including
conversion of the Westar Industries obligation.  In addition, the new
holding company will assume approximately $2.939 billion of existing Western
Resources' debt, giving the transaction an aggregate enterprise value of
approximately $4.442 billion.  The new holding company will have a total
enterprise value of approximately $6.5 billion ($2.6 billion in equity; $3.9
billion in debt and preferred stock).  The transaction will be accounted for
as a purchase and is anticipated to be immediately accretive to PNM's
earnings per share and cash flow.

With the realignment of ETS, we want to remind you of the procedures for 
booking company aircraft service.  As you probably know, one Enron plane has 
been designated for use by ETS for travel between Houston and Omaha and for 
other trips as approved by the vice presidents or us.  Of course, a key 
consideration for approval is the number of passengers, which generally is a 
minimum of 4 - 6, and/or the difficulty of reaching the destination(s) by 
commercial airlines.  The plane is booked on a first come, first served 
basis.  To encourage maximum utilization of the plane, a weekly schedule is 
published and distributed to ETS support team members each week.

Virginia O'Neill coordinates the plane schedule and will continue to do so 
for all trips originating from Omaha.  In addition, we have begun utilizing 
charter aircraft service for trips originating from Omaha within a mileage 
range of 700 - 800 miles.  The utilization of charters for these trips will 
reduce travel costs by eliminating deadhead costs.  Virginia will continue to 
coordinate charter trips from Omaha also.  Beginning today, Julie Armstrong 
will coordinate trips originating from Houston.  Julie and Virginia will work 
together to continue publishing the weekly plane schedule so that travelers 
can utilize the plane when available.   Please remember that company plane 
usage requires the approval of your vice president.  If employees are 
reserving individual available seats on a scheduled flight, vice presidential 
approval isn't required.

If space is available, personal travel for employees and their immediate 
families is permitted.  Imputed income for the cost of the flight will be 
included in the employee's W-2 form at the end of the year.  Please remember 
that personal travelers are always subject to being bumped up to departure 
time by business travelers and that the schedule is subject to frequent 
change.

Please have the following information available when contacting Julie or 
Virginia to book a flight:

 Date of travel & destination  
Lead passenger's name
Other passenger's names (generally need 4 - 6 passengers)
Departure & return times
Ground transportation requirements (if rental cars are required, 
please have the individual's American Express number or Emerald Isle number 
available).
 Purpose of the trip
 Coding if the trip is being charged to a work order

We will continue to monitor usage of the company plane to maximize its usage 
and provide needed private aircraft service for ETS.  In addition, we expect 
that, except for NBPL, the actual aircraft usage cost will be billed directly 
to the user's cost center in year 2001.  However, the billing details are 
still being worked out and will be communicated when finalized.  If you have 
questions or comments, you may contact either of us or Julie or Virginia.

installed along with piping size modifications.

Ethanol Injection
Reviewed and researched (for Marketing) the possibility of injecting Ethano=
l=20
into the pipeline for a possible "Green Energy" rating and as a means of BT=
U=20
enhancement.  Since ethanol would remain a liquid at any normal pipeline=20
conditions, even atomizing the ethanol at the point of injection would not=

insure the Ethanol from liquefying, dropping out and collecting into the=20
pipeline low spots.  Also, there were many issues concerning possible liqui=

entering the fuel systems of our equipment and other customers=01, equipmen=
t. =20
Planning recommended that this project not be pursued.

Researched (for Marketing) was the possibility of burning a Methane/Ethanol=
=20
mix in our equipment (i.e.: Turbines) in order to receive a "Green Power"=
=20
rating.  Solar was contacted concerning the possibility of "co-burning"=20
ethanol and methane.  As a manufacturer they said they would be willing to=
=20
work with us, however, they only recommended it if it were to be a constant=
=20
fuel source.  Solar said there would be considerable fuel injection system=
=20
retrofits required.  Also, if this were not a constant fuel then there woul=
d=20
have to be two separate fuel systems (co-burn and methane only) and a=20
complete fuel control system change.  With all that the project has been=20
deemed cost prohibitive.

Vapor Injection of Propane (VIP Service)
Research was started for Marketing into the possibility of injecting=20
vaporized propane into the pipeline as a way of increasing capacity during=
=20
peak days.  Upon initial review many questions were generated by the planni=
ng=20
team concerning specific requirements of the new service (i.e.: # of days/y=
r,=20
firm, daily firm etc.)  Planning awaits feedback from Marketing before any=

more action is taken.

Electric Generation=20
Proposal was reviewed for Marketing from APA for an engineering study to=20
review the possibility of utilizing stand-by generators as electric produce=

FERC Staff Issues Favorable Draft Environmental Impact Statement on 
Guardian Pipeline

     The FERC Staff has issued a Draft Environmental Impact Statement
determining that construction of Guardian Pipeline would have limited
environmental impact and would be an environmentally acceptable
action, based on its proposed and other mitigation measures. The
Draft covers the environmental aspects of constructing and operating
the 149-mile Guardian Pipeline. FERC will take written public
comments on the Draft until August 28th, and will conduct four public
meetings along Guardian's route starting August 14th. It will
address
the comments before issuing a final Environmental Impact Statement on
the project. A final decision on the Guardian Pipeline expected early
next year. The Guardian Pipeline will transport volumes from
interconnections with Alliance, Northern Border, Midwestern Gas
Transmission, and NGPL at the Chicago hub to northern Illinois and
southern Wisconsin markets. The project will consist of a 25,000
horsepower of compression and 141 miles of 36 inch pipeline extending
from Joliet to the Ixonia, WI, with an additional 8.5 miles of 16
inch pipeline extending from the main Guardian line to near Eagle,
WI.

Ever had a great idea but been uncertain what to do with it?  It's the mental 
equivalent of being all dressed up with no place to go.

Happily, there is help for the idea problem.  The next time you have a 
brilliant idea, make a deposit in the Idea Vault on the ThinkBank.

The ThinkBank will help you earn credit for your ideas.  You can even watch 
your line of credit grow!

And, the next time you're all dressed up with no place to go, just change 
your clothes and have dinner delivered.

Wish you were here!  Can't believe you got away so fast!
How's your job - is it you?
How's Meghan? (sp right?)  Bring her to Poli's party .... I hope you come.

Write me and let me know how you're doing when you can.  Did you buy a
house?
I really miss talking to you (and lunch!).   All my lunch partners are gone.
Linda's wedding is coming along.  The wedding is planned for Sept. 9 - be
here before you know it.
I hate it that I didn't get to say bye to you - you were always a pleasure
to talk to you - always "up" - which is good!
BYE - write when you can.

With the completion of the Enron SAP implementation known as "Apollo & 
Beyond" in August 2000, a new organization, the Integrated Solutions Center 
(ISC), was formed. The ISC is a support organization for Enron-wide back 
office information systems which, of course, includes SAP users and the SAP 
system.

The web is an integral form of support for our customers and as you may know, 
the ISC recently launched a new website in order to better serve its 
customers and to reflect the widening scope of services the ISC has to 
offer.  

>From Friday 1st December 2000 sap.enron.com will route to isc.enron.com in 
preparation for the final closure of the "old" website on Tuesday 5th 
December 2000.  

All due diligence was taken when verifying and validating documents that were 
migrated from the old to the new site.  In order to assist you in navigating 
around isc.enron.com, please note the following navigation tips:

- Online forms reside at isc.enron.com > Online Forms

- Non-online forms (formerly at sap.enron.com > Quick Ref Tools) reside in 
the Document Library at  isc.enron.com > Online Forms > Other forms

- Documentation (ie User Procedures, quick ref cards, step-by-steps) reside 
in the Document Library at isc.enron.com under Get Help > Document Library

Please take a moment today to visit http://isc.enron.com and familiarize 
yourself with the new site if you haven't already been able to do so.

Questions & Comments

Website only:  Call the ISC Call Center at 713-345-4SAP, or send an e-mail 
from the site to the ISC Webmaster.

With deep regret we announce that Joe Sutton, Vice Chairman of Enron, has 
decided to leave the company.  Joe has indicated his desire to pursue other 
opportunities in the energy asset development and operations business.

Joe has been instrumental in making Enron a global company.  We will miss his 
energy and enthusiasm.  We wish Joe the very best as he pursues new endeavors.

Ken and Jeff

Subject: New Peaks, New Prices - CERA Alert




**********************************************************************
CERA Alert: Sent Fri, June 23, 2000
**********************************************************************

Title: New Peaks, New Prices
Author: Zenker, Moritzburke, Snyder
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: Western Energy ,
URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1247 ,

In the West, July typically marks the start of the summer cooling season, 
which, along with waning hydroelectric energy production and the more 
frequent use of gas-fired generators to meet demand, causes steadily rising 
power prices. CERA expects the West to be the only region in North America 
with a year-over-year increase in peak electricity demand. Power prices 
already established new record highs in June, suggesting that as demand 
reaches its peak during the coming summer months western power markets will 
continue to experience increased volatility compared with last year's levels. 
The convergence of natural gas prices that are much higher than last year's 
levels, growing demand for power, and reduced hydroelectric energy production 
when compared with levels in 1999 is pushing up western power prices. 
Merchant and other gas-fired generators will be pressed into service, 
experiencing their strongest utilization rates since the drought year of 1994.

Greater utilization of gas-fired generators within the West has supported 
western differentials and contributed to high gas prices throughout North 
America. Western gas prices should continue to be strong, boosted by 
continuing increases in regional gas demand for power generation and pressure 
across North America to inject gas into storage in anticipation of summer 
power loads.

The main drivers of higher power and gas prices when compared with 
year-earlier levels will be

*  Peak WSCC load season. Summer weather will drive loads to the year's 
coincident peak, which is most likely to occur during the July/August period 
but could arrive any time during the June through October air-conditioning 
season. CERA expects demand growth of 3.1 percent in the third quarter 
compared with levels in 1999, which will push Western Systems Coordinating 
Council (WSCC) coincident peak demand levels to 2.7 percent over 1999 levels.

*  Waning hydroelectric output. Hydroelectric production is on its normal 
downward seasonal slide. This resource decline is more visible when compared 
with the 1999 hydro season, which was both abundant and prolonged.

*  High utilization rates for gas-fired generators. Growing demand for 
electricity, coupled with a declining availability of hydroelectric energy, 
will drive utilization rates of gas-fired power plants to their highest 
levels since the drought year of 1994.

*  Higher fuel prices. Western gas prices have remained at $1.00-$1.50 per 
MMBtu above 1999 levels. Growing year-over-year gas demand for power 
generation is providing much of the price pressure in western markets. These 
higher gas prices provide a boost to both on-peak and off-peak power prices 
of between $10 and $15 per megawatt-hour (MWh).

Regional Power Market Drivers

Power markets in the West are poised to break records for demand, peak load, 
and gas-fired plant utilization and, as a result, power prices.

A return to normal summer weather coupled with growing demand for power will 
push demand for electricity up by 5,274 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in the US West 
for the third quarter compared with 1999 levels, or almost 2,400 megawatts 
(MW) on average (see Table 1). This growth in the demand for electricity will 
also drive peak loads to new highs. CERA expects the 1999 WSCC coincident 
peak to be exceeded by 2.7 percent, climbing to nearly 119,000 MW. As was 
demonstrated by the mild summer of 1999, deviations from normal weather could 
boost or thwart this peak demand growth figure.

Two key factors will significantly reduce third quarter hydroelectric 
production levels compared with 1999 levels.

*  First, CERA expects West-wide total season hydroelectric production in 
2000 of roughly 100 percent of historical average levels, substantially lower 
than the approximately 120 percent of average in 1999.

*  Second, runoff was prolonged in 1999, serving to push a substantial 
portion of the hydroelectric production into the summer period (see Figure 
1). On average, CERA expects these factors will remove 9,187 GWh, or almost 
4,200 average megawatts (aMW), from the western resource base compared with 
1999 levels. Exacerbating this decline, refilling of reservoirs and flow 
restrictions to assist fish migration will cause periodic but significant 
curtailments in power production at key Pacific Northwest hydroelectric 
facilities.

Natural gas-fired facilities will be called upon to supply most of the 
expected increase in demand, while also replacing hydroelectric resources as 
they continue to decline. This will push average annual utilization rates of 
gas-fired combined cycle, steam, and cogeneration plants to approximately 38 
percent in 2000--levels not experienced since the 41 percent annual average 
utilization rate in 1994, a year marked by drought and warmer-than-normal 
summer weather. Utilization rates for these facilities will also surge past 
1999 levels, especially this summer. CERA anticipates a West-wide third 
quarter utilization rate of 59 percent for these facilities under normal 
summer weather conditions, compared with 46 percent for the same period of 
1999.

This level of utilization will certainly establish gas-fired generation as 
the floor to power prices during the third quarter, during not only the 
on-peak demand period but the off-peak as well. With natural gas prices at 
$1.00-$1.50 per MMBtu higher than 1999 levels, power prices are boosted by 
$10-$15 per MWh owing to fuel price increases alone. With supply tightness 
already evident in western power markets, the stage is set for increased 
price volatility compared with 1999 levels as episodes of hot weather require 
increased utilization of less-efficient generators throughout this summer.

Pacific Northwest

The water supply forecast for the Columbia River remains near average but has 
dropped a couple percentage points from last month. Flows are expected to 
remain at roughly 96 percent of average through September on the Lower 
Columbia and 103 percent of average on the Upper Columbia. Conditions overall 
are still sufficient to be considered average. This return to normal 
conditions in the Pacific Northwest should produce hydroelectric output 
nearly 2,700 GWh (18 percent) lower than last year for July and 8,405 GWh 
lower for the third quarter as a whole (see Table 2).

The region's load growth coupled with lower hydro supply will continue to 
elevate power prices in the Pacific Northwest relative to 1999 levels. 
Tighter supply conditions in California and the Southwest will attract energy 
exports from the Pacific Northwest, preserving a differential between the 
Pacific Northwest and California of about $1 per MWh on average.

Price differentials between the Pacific Northwest and California have varied 
dramatically recently, with the north at times rising above those to the 
south owing to local demand and hydroelectric constraints caused by reservoir 
filling operations. Since the end of May, volatility in both markets has 
pushed the difference between daily on-peak prices at COB and those in 
California from a premium of $120 per MWh to a discount of $55 per MWh within 
a few days. CERA expects that over the long run, California markets will 
clear at a premium as the summer progresses, but the differential will vary 
widely, with episodes of Pacific Northwest power pricing at a premium to 
those in California.

California

Despite below-average precipitation and snowpack this year, California 
reservoir storage levels throughout the state are higher than normal, ranging 
between 108 and 166 percent of average for the state's primary runoff 
regions. Under these conditions hydroelectric output should be roughly 4 
percent (363 GWh) below last year's levels for the third quarter (see Table 
2). With a return to normal weather conditions relative to third quarter 
1999, cooling demand this summer will increase most in California, where 
weather was nearly 30 percent cooler than average last year.

Recent day-ahead power prices in California have drawn attention to the West 
as the highest-cost market (if only temporarily) in North America. Record 
high temperatures and unscheduled unit outages produced new day-ahead price 
records, with power prices on June 15 at $457 per MWh in the day-ahead 
on-peak market and real-time hourly prices at the market cap of $750 per MWh. 
Increased utilization of gas-fired generation and daily gas prices of around 
$5 per MMBtu (burner-tip in Southern California) have kept daily average 
off-peak prices between $40 and $80 per MWh. Notably, these higher price have 
occurred during periods when roughly 1,800 MW more coal-fire generation was 
available in the West compared with the same period in 1999. CERA expects 
prices to continue to respond to the tight capacity environment this summer.

Rockies and Southwest

During summer 1999, the Rockies/Southwest was the only region to experience 
above-average cooling demand, suggesting that normal weather should bring 
only moderate demand growth of less than 1 percent (see Table 3). However, 
growing energy demand in neighboring regions and a large transmission 
transfer capability will pull energy from the Rockies/Southwest region when 
excess capacity is available, ensuring that prices in the region will remain 
tightly connected to price levels in other parts of the West.

Palo Verde prices have generally kept pace with other western markets, while 
maintaining their characteristic premium to the California Power Exchange 
during spring and early summer. CERA expects Southwest prices to strengthen 
relative to California when summer weather periodically shifts the locus of 
demand to the Southwest. However, California prices will maintain a premium 
on average to those in the Southwest, as the effects of the state's tight 
supply situation translates to higher prices than those in either the 
Southwest or Pacific Northwest.

Regional Gas Market Drivers

Under continuing pressure to inject gas into storage in the face of declining 
supply and increasing gas demand for power generation, gas prices at the 
Henry Hub are expected to average $4.45 per MMBtu in July. The strong demand 
for gas for power generation will keep differentials strong in the southern 
half of the West. In the Rockies, pipeline constraints will keep 
differentials wide.

The heightened call on gas demand for power generation, driven by the 
declining hydroelectric generation and increasing power loads, is expected to 
drive demand increases of 1.6 Bcf per day relative to July 1999 and 660 MMcf 
per day relative to June 2000 demand levels. Gas demand for power generation 
is expected to reach a monthly average record level of 4.9 Bcf per day in 
July (see Tables 4 and 5). These increases will result in declines in western 
storage injection rates and in exports from the West. Both Permian and San 
Juan supplies will be pulled increasingly toward the West Coast during July.

Low storage inventories and needed increases in injections are driving North 
American gas pricing. The West is the one US region actually running a 
storage surplus, but the recent heat waves and associated pull on gas 
supplies have eroded that surplus, particularly in California (see Table 6). 
Given the expected increases in gas demand, the western surplus should 
continue its decline. This decline and very high demand will reinforce the 
volatility in differentials already evident this summer.

California

Because of the early hot weather in the West and strong gas demand for power 
generation, Topock prices have been extremely high and volatile. So far this 
month, Topock has averaged over $0.30 per MMBtu above the Henry Hub. Flows on 
El Paso and Transwestern into California increased by over 300 million cubic 
feet (MMcf) per day during June relative to May averages, and flows are 
expected to continue to climb by an additional 400 MMcf per day during July. 
PGT continues to run near capacity (see Table 7). At the same time, the 
storage levels within California look likely to fall below last year's levels 
sometime during the month.

This intense demand pressure--California demand should increase by nearly 500 
MMcf per day in July relative to June--will keep utilization rates on import 
pipelines high and sustain Topock differentials. CERA expects the Topock to 
Henry Hub differential to average $0.30 per MMBtu during July (see Table 8). 
This high differential will likely persist through the summer, with 
differentials rising above $0.50 per MMBtu during West Coast heat waves.

Southwest

San Juan price differentials have been volatile, narrowing during periods of 
very high western demand. However, a very high utilization rate on pipeline 
capacity into California has widened the Topock-San Juan differential, and 
that wide gap is expected to persist. On average, San Juan differentials to 
the Henry Hub are expected to narrow from current levels as southwestern 
demand increases with western temperatures. Demand in the Southwest is 
expected to climb from 1.4 Bcf per day in June to 1.5 Bcf per day in July. 
This increased call on regional supplies and an expected strengthening in 
Permian prices should result in an average San Juan differential to the Henry 
Hub of $0.18 per MMBtu.

In the Permian Basin, prices are expected to strengthen as Texas power demand 
climbs. Combined with the pull on supplies from the West, Permian 
differentials should narrow from their current levels of $0.20 per MMBtu to 
below $0.10 per MMBtu.

Pacific Northwest

Strong June hydroelectric output has limited the call on gas supplies in the 
Pacific Northwest so far this summer, but as hydroelectric output decreases 
in June and July, gas demand will increase dramatically. CERA expects an 
increase of nearly 200 MMcf per day during July relative to June levels. The 
limited demand so far has meant differentials between Malin and the Henry Hub 
of as much as $0.30 per MMBtu and Topock to Malin differentials of over $0.60 
per MMBtu. The Malin to Henry Hub differential has narrowed slightly to 
around $0.20 per MMBtu. It should continue to strengthen with growth in 
regional demand and average $0.00 per MMBtu during July.

Rocky Mountains

Regional gas supply within the Rocky Mountains continues to increase, 
bolstered by continuing growth in the Powder River Basin. This April, exports 
out of the Rockies reached 3.2 Bcf per day, a record high. Although there is 
excess pipeline capacity out of the region into the Southwest on the 
Transcolorado and Northwest pipelines, high utilization rates have widened 
Rockies differentials with the rest of the West. In particular, Rockies to 
San Juan differentials have averaged nearly $0.25 per MMBtu for June after 
pricing close to parity earlier in the year. That gap should persist through 
the summer, as gas-fired generation climbs across the rest of the West. 
Demand is expected to average the same level in July as in June in the Rocky 
Mountains, where coal limits gas's gains in power generation.

CERA expects prices within the Rockies to gather some support from increasing 
power loads in the Pacific Northwest, as well as from stronger differentials 
in the San Juan Basin. On average, Rockies differentials to the Henry Hub are 
expected to average $0.52 per MMBtu during July.

In response to the increasing supplies flowing out of the Powder River Basin 
and the increasing pipeline capacity utilization on export pipelines, 
Trailblazer has announced an open season for two possible options to extend 
and expand the 500 mile pipeline from Wyoming into Nebraska. Although timing 
and volumes have yet to be announced, the additional capacity could prevent 
serious bottlenecks from developing out of the region, which CERA would 
expect by 2002 without capacity additions.

Sempra - We sold a Nov - March FT contract to Sempra this week for 2,000 
MMBtu/d from EOT to Panhandle.  The contract is a one-part rate for 
$.07/MMBtu.

Red Cedar - We received the cash out payment of nearly $800,000 from Red 
Cedar this week effectively clearing their imbalance owed to TW.  In 
addition, they gave us verbal approval to begin scoping a new receivable 
point to deliver approximately 50,000 MMBtu/d to TW south of La Plata.  
Facility Planning is providing a cost estimate.

SouthWest Gas - has agreed to remove the new piece of pipe that bypasses the 
new meter constructed near Las Vegas.  They have also agreed to amend the FT 
contract begin date so TW can re-sell their capacity that they won't be able 
to utilize due to their construction delays.  We are waiting on a new 
contract begin date before we resell the space.

Transport Options Filing - The new tariff was filed with FERC on Tuesday Oct. 
17.  We anticipate most protests should be received no later than Nov. 6.  We 
also have several customers filing in support of the new tariff.

Wish you were here!  Can't believe you got away so fast!
How's your job - is it you?
How's Meghan? (sp right?)  Bring her to Poli's party .... I hope you come.

Write me and let me know how you're doing when you can.  Did you buy a
house?
I really miss talking to you (and lunch!).   All my lunch partners are gone.
Linda's wedding is coming along.  The wedding is planned for Sept. 9 - be

I hate it that I didn't get to say bye to you - you were always a pleasure
to talk to you - always "up" - which is good!
BYE - write when you can.

You know all those credit card offers you get, offering great introductory 
rates with a balance transfer?  Forget them.  Introduce yourself to the 
ThinkBank instead.

Starting Friday, October 27, you can use "Good Sense" in the ThinkBank to 
find creativity resources, tips and techniques to make your job more 
fulfilling.  There is also a vault full of ideas from your fellow Enron 
employees.

The ThinkBank is committed to keeping your interest rate high.  When was the 
last time a credit card offer told you the truth about that?

Some of you have had problems with this months newsletter - sorry.  The 
system we normally use to create it on was down and even though this one was 
compatible with the group I test with, it did not work well with everyone.  
If you have trouble viewing or printing the format, or just prefer another 
format, I have 2 other versions I can send you.  Just reply to this note or 
call me at 713-853-3986.  If the majority have problems and another version 
works, I'll resend it to the whole group.  For the moment, I'll keep working 
one-on-one.  

Thanks,
Donna

News Briefs:

Reliant Energy Plans to Form Two Public Companies

Reliant Energy said it plans to file with the Texas Public Utility
Commission a business separation plan under which it would divide into two
publicly traded companies to separate its unregulated businesses from its
regulated businesses.

The company plans an initial public offering of approximately 20% of the
common stock of its unregulated operations late this year or early in 2001,
assuming market conditions remain favorable. The company expects the IPO to
be followed by a distribution to shareholders of the remaining stock of the
unregulated company within 12 months. The remaining businesses, which are
predominately regulated, will be structured as a holding company.

The unregulated company will own Reliant Energy's unregulated power
generation and related energy trading and marketing operations, its
unregulated retail businesses, which currently include energy,
telecommunications and internet services, and the company's European
electric generating and trading/marketing operations. The plan also
contemplates that in 2004 the unregulated company will receive from the
regulated company cash equal to the market value of the regulated company's
interest in its Texas regulated generation operations. In addition, the
unregulated company will have an option to purchase the regulated company's
interest in these operations at a price equal to the market value.

The regulated company will include Reliant Energy's electricity and natural
gas companies, which serve about four million customers in the U.S. and
include Reliant Energy HL&P/Entex, Reliant Energy Arkla, Reliant Energy
Entex and Reliant Energy Minnegasco. Other operations in the entity will
include its U.S. interstate pipelines, its interests in Latin America and,
initially, its Texas regulated generation.

Subject: Sierra Pacific Resources Announces Sale of Las Vegas Power Plant


  RENO, NEVADA, Dec. 11/PR Newswire/ -- Sierra
 Pacific Resources (NYSE: SRP), parent company of Nevada
 Power Company and Sierra Pacific Power Company, today
 announced that Nevada Power Company has agreed to sell the
 Sunrise Station electric generating plant in Las Vegas,
 Nev., to Reliant Energy Power Generation, Inc., a
 subsidiary of Reliant Energy (NYSE: REI). The sale
 includes two generating units owned by Nevada Power and
 rights to electricity produced by three additional units
 on the Sunrise site owned by an independent power
 producer.

  The sale price of the generating station was $106
 million, subject to taxes and other adjustments at
 closing. In conjunction with the purchase, Nevada Power
 negotiated the right to buy energy and ancillary services
 from Reliant Energy Power Generation for agreed upon
 prices from closing until March 1, 2003, at a cost of $73
 million based on time of closing. This will result in a
 net price for the generating plant upon closing of
 approximately $33 million.

  "With the sale of Sunrise Station, divestiture of
 our generation assets is nearly complete. The buyer is a
 leader in power generation and has already established a
 strong presence in southern Nevada," said Walter M.
 Higgins, chairman, president and chief executive officer
 of Sierra Pacific Resources. "We'll soon be able to devote
 all our resources to building the best energy transmission
 and distribution company in the West."

  Sunrise Station consists of two generating units
 that can be fueled by natural gas or oil capable of
 producing up to 149 megawatts of electricity. The facility
 also includes three additional gas turbine generating
 units rated at 222 megawatts. These three units are owned
 by an independent power producer, Nevada Sun-Peak Limited
 Partnership, under contract to Nevada Power. All five of
 the units are located on a 38-acre site at the base of
 Frenchman Mountain near the eastern edge of Las Vegas.
 There are no regular full-time employees at Sunrise
 Station.

  Sale of the generating assets is a regulatory
 condition of the 1999 merger of Sierra Pacific Resources
 and Nevada Power. The sale is expected to close in
 mid-2001, subject to approval and review by various
 regulatory agencies.

  The company intends to complete the sale and
 transfer of all its generating assets in Nevada in 2001.

  Credit Suisse First Boston acted as financial
 advisor to Sierra Pacific Resources on the Sunrise Station
 sale. Navigant Consulting served as the technical advisor.

  Headquartered in Nevada, Sierra Pacific Resources
 is a holding company whose principal subsidiaries are
 Nevada Power Company, the electric utility for southern
 Nevada; and Sierra Pacific Power Company, the electric
 utility for most of northern Nevada and the Lake Tahoe
 area of California, and a natural gas and water
 distributor in the Reno-Sparks area. Other subsidiaries
 include the Tuscarora Gas Pipeline Company, which owns 50
 percent interest in an interstate natural gas transmission
 partnership; and Sierra Pacific Communications, a
 telecommunications company.

  Reliant Energy and a partner jointly own and
 operate El Dorado Energy, a 480-megawatt, natural
 gas-fired facility southeast of Las Vegas. In October,
 Reliant Energy announced plans to construct a
 500-megawatt, natural gas-fired power plant about 20 miles
 north of Las Vegas, off Interstate 15.

  Based in Houston, Tex., Reliant Energy is an
 international energy services and energy delivery company
 with $20 billion in annual revenue and assets totaling $30
 billion. The company has a wholesale energy trading and
 marketing business that ranks among the top five in the
 U.S. in combined electricity and natural gas volumes and a
 presence in most of the major power regions of the U.S.
 The company has nearly 27,000 megawatts of power
 generation in operation in the U.S. and Western Europe and
 has announced acquisitions and development projects that
 will add another 4,000 megawatts.

Pipeline Operations - As of December, 1 TW is back to scheduling over 
1,054,000 MMBtu/d to the California border.  The preliminary indication on 
the corrosion dig-outs that occurred this week is the pipe appears to be OK 
but the final call will come from Max Brown's office shortly.  

Gas Inventory Sale - In preparation for the corrosion dig-outs this week, we 
assisted operations in relieving some line pressure by selling gas inventory 
at the Cal Border pool.  We sold 10,000 MMBtu for gas day 11/30 at 
$14.00/MMBtu.

Expired ROFR's - Two contract ROFR notifications expired this week 
(11/30/2000).  Both of these contracts will terminate next year 11/30/2001.  
Burlington has  15,000 MMBtu/d from  Ignacio to Blanco and PG&E has 20,000 
MMBtu/d from Blanco to EOT.  

Park N Ride - Eprime signed a 50,000 MMBtu/d park and ride agreement 
effective 12/01/2000.  Current posted rates are at max of .3883.
Invoices are going out next week.

El Paso Puts Off Maintenance to Meet CA Demand

El Paso Natural Gas has decided to postpone what it called "routine" 
maintenance projects on its system in order to maintain the flow of natural 
gas into the California market to meet the surge in demand there. The higher 
demand has been created by a shortfall in energy imports from the Northwest 
region, which has been gripped by cold weather. 

The pipeline deferred indefinitely two maintenance projects on the South 
Mainline --- at Wenden Station in Arizona and the Wenden A turbine --- that 
were scheduled to take place today and Friday. It also deferred indefinitely 
work on the North Mainline at Hackberry 2 turbine in Arizona, which was to 
have occurred Dec. 10-17. 

If El Paso had gone forward with the maintenance projects, the company said 
throughput would have been cut by about 150 MMcf/d on its South Mainline, by 
50-75 MMcf/d on the Havasu Crossover, and by 80 MMcf/d on its North Mainline. 

The maintenance work at the Wenden Station, which is located on the south end 
of the Havasu Crossing, involved replacing batteries. "It has been agreed to 
by our operations people that those batteries are still in decent enough 
shape, [so] it's not a concern to continue running like this. And with the 
throughput situation and high gas prices [in California], it's in everybody's 
best interest that we not do this maintenance at this time," said Charlie 
Mathis, an administrator for pipeline control at El Paso. 

He estimated the El Paso system presently is running at 85-90% of the 
throughput level it had prior to the explosion near Carlsbad, NM, last 
August. That blast reduced the pipeline's operating capacity by 200 MMcf/d. 

Mathis said about 1.2 Bcf/d presently is being delivered into California over 
El Paso's South Mainline, and 1.5-1.7 Bcf/d is being delivered at Topock, AZ, 
over its North Mainline. 

In addition to the deferred maintenance projects, El Paso took a Waha GE 
turbine off line last Sunday to investigate a vibration problem. That has 
reduced capacity on the South Mainline by about 50 MMcf/d, said Mathis. He 
noted the turbine is scheduled to be back in service Friday. 

To offset the impact of the turbine outage on the market, El Paso decided to 
put off until this weekend work it had planned to do on Line 1100 between the 
Pecos River and the Guadalupe Stations --- a line that was affected by the 
explosion last August. The line will be taken out of service Dec. 8 and 
returned to service on Dec. 9, reducing the capacity of the South Mainline by 
50 MMcf/d each day. 

In the near term, El Paso is scheduled to run a smart pig through Line 3222 
on its North Mainline on Dec. 12, which will reduce capacity out of the San 
Juan Basin by about 50-100 MMcf/d, Mathis said. Pigging also is planned for 
Line 3201, which will cut capacity by about 150 MMcf/d. The reductions will 
affect points upstream of the Bondad Mainline and Gallup.

Christine, pls draft the IOS language for posting the 14,000/day capacity to 
Topock for the period April thru Oct 2001.  I would like the IOS on our Web 
page for Friday 8/4.  The IOS should include  Alt delivery rights to Needles 
and Citizens/Griffith when that point becomes active late next summer (when 
the power plant comes on line).  TW reserves the right to reject all bids (I 
think with the exception of max rate bids).  Please check with the Team and 
Susan Scott with any questions.

Bids will be taken between 10:00am - 2pm CST on Thurs. 8/10.

Please see Lorraine on any questions when drafting the posting or procedures 
(all documents are on the shared drive).

We will need to call shippers and possibly draft a message to be posted in 
Gas Daily for Monday 8/7.

E prime would have interest in the following expansion plans:

1.  Creating a Cunningham/Maddox connection directly from the Linam plant:
Dave Engbrock (303-308-6002) would have more information on this idea in
terms of volume and rate commitments.

2.  Increasing the CIG/Tumbleweed interconnect capacity from 40,000 to
60,000:  During the summer, e prime flowed up to 15,000 from CIG into TW's
PEPL Pool;  if this capacity were expanded, we might be able to get more
supply off CIG.  The problem we had this summer was that at times the
capacity was reduced to 25,000 due to operational reasons, and that was not
enough room for all shippers.  Any additional supply that e prime brings in
from this area will most likely go to shippers who already have firm
transport to California, or e prime may be interested in shipping this to
the Waha area.

3.  E prime would be interested in 10,000/d of capacity from NW Pipeline to
Socal Topock--term could be anywhere from 1 to 2 years, rate would be the
maximum rate.

If you have any additional questions, please feel free to contact me at
303-308-6072.

Transportation Notes

Projecting that linepack would slip below its minimum target level through 
Thursday, Pacific Gas & Electric issued a systemwide Stage 3 OFO, effective 
today until further notice. The order carries penalties of $5/Dth for 
negative daily imbalances exceeding a 3% tolerance. 

As a result of warmer area weather and banking on its system, Northwest said 
it is operationally feasible to loosen conditions of its entitlement for 
delivery points north of Kemmerer (WY) Station. A Declared Stage II (8% 
tolerance) Overrun Entitlement will take effect today; through Tuesday the 
pipeline was in a Stage I (3%) Entitlement. A shipper is subject to penalties 
for overtakes north of Kemmerer that exceed an amount 8% greater than its 
confirmed nominations. 

El Paso will take the B turbine at Cornudas Station in West Texas down for 
maintenance today and Thursday, reducing South Mainline capacity there by 60 
MMcf/d. However, Cornudas capacity has not been fully utilized recently, the 
pipeline said, so this reduction should not affect current markets. 

The Kinder Morgan pipeline group (NGPL, Kinder Morgan Interstate, 
Trailblazer, Canyon Creek, KN Wattenburg and TransColorado) reminded shippers 
it has a new 24-hour hotline phone number for information and questions about 
point confirmations and related issues: (713) 369-9683. The old hotline will 
stay in service through Dec. 31, but callers will hear a recording giving the 
new number. The current number for nomination-related issues, (713) 369-9670, 
is not changing, Kinder Morgan said.

It's six months into the new Millennium.  Where do you get your company 
news?  Enron, cited as the Most Innovative Company in America for five years 
in a row, prints a newsletter every two months.  We could reorganize entire 
business units between issues.  Twice.

Don't worry.  Our printed newsletter isn't going anywhere; it's still the 
best way to bring you detailed accounts of Enron's long-term business 
direction and achievements.  

Let's just say that print has a new friend.  And -- you guessed it -- that 
friend is the dot.  As in "dot.com"; as in you now have an online connection 
for fast-breaking news about and around Enron.  It's called eBiz, and it will 
change the way you get news.  It might even change the way you think about 
news.  

eBiz will come racing across the Enron intranet on home.enron.com every two 
weeks, and we will post breaking news and announcements as they happen.  The 
news in eBiz will be so fresh and timely and fun to read, you may have to 
skip your morning coffee so you don't miss anything.

Get ready, get set, get connected with eBiz.

Good news:  I've just received word that the FERC has issued an order denying 
SoCal's request for rehearing of the Gallup order.  FERC also ordered that 
TW's request for rehearing (which asked the Commission not to require TW to 
disclose discounted rates) is now moot because we filed a discount report at 
the time required by Section 284.7(b)(6) of the Commission's rules (as we 
always do).  

If SoCal is still feeling vindictive, they can file an appeal in the D.C. 
Circuit.  I believe their window is 60 days.  In any event, the pendency of 
an appeal would not affect the validity of our certificate.

If you have any questions, let me know.

Several Enron executives, along with more than 400 employees, gave Depelchin 
Children's Center a facelift on Friday, September 15 during the 
United Way Day of Caring.  Enron employees worked on projects such as 
painting, landscaping, building fences, cleaning, children's
activities, and creating vibrant murals.  Thank you Enron employees for 
making a difference.  Excellent work!

Michelle,

Our dba has loaded TW base differential to test database from revenue 
management data base
after Vernon added TW to his regular update.
The spreadsheet is the latest NYMEX and base differential for 4 areas of TW 
as of 11/28/00.
Please take a look.  If no problem, I'll apply the same logic that I used to 
create this spreadsheet
to TW deal analysis program.  I'll dynamically get the latest price from the 
table based on 
receipt point location.
Please let me know.
Thanks,

Mei-Ling

Sometimes it's the little things that make the biggest impact.

Maybe you've never stopped to think about it, but for many of us, Post-it 
notes may be one of our most frequently used communication tools at Enron.

Because of this, every employee received, or soon will receive, a packet of 
Post-it notes with a thought-provoking quote about communication.  These 
Post-it notes reinforce the importance of communication at Enron.  The 
individuals who are quoted on the notepads personify the true meaning of 
communication.

We hope that as you use these notepads in your daily work, you will think 
about the importance of communication to the continued success of Enron and 
work just a little harder at communicating more openly at Enron.

Please email Gina Taylor (gtaylor@enron.com) for Post-it note distribution 
inquiries.

Note:  This article gives some of the strategy and economics of the purchase 
of Montana Power by Pan Canadian.  
We will look at the Oklahoma reserves for location and strategy with our 
pipe--with the switch in ownership, they may be 
receptive to strategy changes.

PanCanadian Says Montana Power Purchase 'Beautiful Fit'

To extend what it sees as dominance in Canada's natural gas market and to 
boost its production by 10%, PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd. yesterday agreed to 
purchase Montana Power Co. for $475 million. The properties will extend 
PanCanadian's existing shallow gas properties in southern Alberta into 
northern Montana, adding 94 MMcf/d and 3,800 barrels of crude oil and natural 
gas liquids. 

The acquisition will give PanCanadian properties in Alberta, Montana, 
Colorado, Oklahoma and Wyoming, along with three gas pipelines linking 
Alberta and Saskatchewan to Montana. 

"We have a focus on natural gas," said CEO David Tuer during a conference 
call yesterday in Calgary. "This is clearly our future. It is difficult to 
put any negative on this (acquisition) and it's likely to stay valuable for 
the foreseeable future." 

Montana Power's production is more than 90% natural gas and associated 
liquids, and the acquisition substantially extends PanCanadian's land and 
infrastructure, allowing it to use its technology and operating strategies in 
a region that extends along the Alberta-Montana border. 

"The Montana Power assets clearly fit our strengths and allow us to employ 
our expertise in developing long life reserves of shallow and medium depth 
natural gas," Tuer said. "The potential in these assets is significant, and 
over the next few years, we will add substantially to PanCanadian's daily 
natural gas production." 

Tuer said that the acquisition extends the company's dominance in shallow 
gas, and called Montana Power a "beautiful fit with PanCanadian's gas 
strategy, land position and technological capability." 

PanCanadian's newest acquisition adds reserves of 550 Bcf and 20 MM barrels 
of oil and natural gas liquids on a proven and one-half probable basis, said 
officials. Production and reserves account for $520 million of the purchase 
price, while the remainder is made up of $135 million for the midstream and 
marketing assets, $40 million for the undeveloped land (about 600,000 acres), 
and $7 million of working capital. 

Tuer said the company was paying 77 cents/Mcfe of proven and on-half probable 
reserves. The price for daily flowing production, based on a 6:1 ration of 
gas to BOE is $4,450/Mcfe, or $26,710/BOE. 

Along with the added Alberta and Montana properties, PanCanadian also picks 
up some land in Colorado's Denver Basin, which now produces about 31 MMcf/d. 
Other land that is part of the sale is located in the Anadarko Basin of 
Oklahoma and the Green River Basin of Wyoming. 

Three natural gas pipelines that cross from Montana into Alberta and 
Saskatchewan also are included. The pipelines allow direct access to the U.S. 
markets for southern Alberta and Saskatchewan gas, and serve more than 1.2 
million net acres of developed and undeveloped lands, with most of it 
concentrated in parcels that span the Canada-Montana border. 

Midstream assets that go to PanCanadian include a natural gas marketing 
company in Butte, MT, along with a deep cut gas processing and fractionation 
plant in Colorado. The Fort Lupton, CO plant processes more than 60 MMcf/d 
and 5,500 barrels of natural gas liquids and condensate. 

In all, the total developed and undeveloped land is roughly 1.2 million net 
acres, or 1.7 million gross acres, said PanCanadian. 

"Montana Power fit us like a glove," Tuer said during the conference call. He 
said the acquisition will help PanCanadian to remain "best of class" for what 
it does. "It makes our sandbox that much bigger." 

The acquisition, which is expected to close around Oct. 31, will increase 
both PanCanadian's net income and cash flow this year and in subsequent 
years, said Tuer. The added gas production will immediately increase the 
company's natural gas, as a percentage of total production, to 58%, based on 
a 6:1 ratio of gas to BOE. 

About 25% of the natural gas being acquired from Montana Power now is being 
sold to Montana Power utilities for $1.50 to $1.60 MMcf until July 2002, and 
because it's priced below the open market officials think future earnings 
will be good. 

"As that contract expires, there's a lot of potential from the price in this 
transaction," Tuer said. 

And what's to become of Montana Power? Earlier this year, the 88-year-old 
company, headquartered in Butte, announced it would divest itself of four of 
its traditional energy businesses. By selling its coal production, natural 
gas transmission and distribution, independent power production and oil and 
gas exploration and production businesses, it plans to reinvest the proceeds 
in Touch America, a fiber optics and telecommunications business, which is 
also a subsidiary of Montana Power. 

"The process to determine the buyer for our oil and gas business was robust, 
and we are delighted with the result," said Montana Power CEO Robert P. 
Gannon. "We believe there will be a meshing of business strategies and that 
cultural synergy's exist between the purchased companies and Pan Canadian." 
He noted that Montana Power has had a Canadian presence for almost 50 years. 

PanCanadian purchased the entire oil and gas division, which now employs 
about 170. PanCanadian plans to maintain a regional office in Butte, invest 
in the acquired properties and grow daily gas production. There was no word 
on whether any jobs would be lost.

The mission of ETS Operations Technical Services (OTS) remains unchanged.  
Our goal is to be an integral part of field operations, provide the highest 
level of technical support possible and assist the field operations teams in 
achieving their objectives.  To that end and as a part of ETS's on-going 
transition of merging  ETS's and EOTT's Operations, I am pleased to announce 
a realignment of ETS Operations Technical Services.  

The purpose of these changes is to better align our technical resources with 
the new Operations Areas and teams and better serve their needs.  Therefore, 
we will form Area Technical Support Teams for each of the Technical 
disciplines (Corrosion, Measurement and Controls & Electrical):  

Max Brown, Director of Corrosion Services, will lead the Corrosion teams.
Kenneth Cessac, Director of Measurement Services, will have responsibility 
for the Measurement Support teams.
Ken Crowl, Director of Controls and Electrical Services will provide 
leadership to the C&E teams.  
Steve Klimesh, Business Consultant, will provide on-going support to ETS on 
UAF and other continuous improvement initiatives.   
The Clifton and Beaver machines shops will remain a part of OTS as we 
continue to grow the Enron Machine and Mechanical Services business.  

The attached organizational charts show the new Tech Services.  The vacancies 
reflected on the charts are an effort to shore up our technical support staff 
for operating the EOTT assets.  In the coming weeks, our Technical Support 
Teams will be further defining their support roles to the Region and team 
level and working diligently to fill these vacancies.  Any thoughts or 
comments that you might have regarding these changes are certainly 
appreciated.  Please feel free to call me or any of the OTS Directors with 
your feedback or for assistance.  Our goal is to continue to provide the best 
service possible to you, our customers.

Note:  There will be a briefing meeting on the project in Denver on Nov. 14

N. Border Plans Extension to Tap Powder River Basin

Powder River Basin gas producers may be about to get a more direct route to 
Midwest markets. Northern Border Pipeline has released plans to build a new 
325-mile greenfield pipeline from McCabe, MT, to Gillette, WY, to tap the 
rapidly growing production in the Powder River, which is estimated to hold 
between 10 and 30 Tcf of gas. 

The basin's rapid production growth has captured the attention of the 
industry, with numerous proposed pipelines, including several new interstate 
plans that would bring gas to the Midcontinent gas grid. Northern Border's 
project, called the Bison Pipeline, would add a new route out of the basin 
for between 375,000 and 500,000 MMBtu/d of production starting in November 
2003. The pipeline is holding an open season on the proposal through Dec. 5. 

Receipt points are proposed with Bighorn, Fort Union Gas Gathering, MIGC and 
Thunder Creek Gas Services. A bi-directional interconnect accessing Williston 
Basin Interstate Pipeline's Baker storage field also is proposed. 

The connection with Northern Border will provide Powder River producers with 
direct access to several local distribution companies, including 
Montana-Dakota, Alliant Interstate Power, MidAmerican Energy, Nicor Gas, 
People Gas and Nipsco. It also provides access to ANR Pipeline, Midwestern, 
NGPL, Northern and Vector. 

The projected recourse rate is 26 cents/Dth/d, but a negotiated 10-year 
demand rate cuts 4 cents off that. The pipeline is offering 
"mileage-sensitive rates," which are expected to allow a shipper to tailor 
supply access and optimize transportation value. 

Northern Border plans to hold a briefing on the project in Denver on Nov. 14. 
For more information, contact project director Paul Miller in Omaha, NB, at 
(402) 398-7758 or James Hoff in Denver at (303) 575-6475, or see the 
pipeline's Web site at www.northernborderpartners.com.

We have moved another change into production where any bid equal to over the 
max rate will be valued using a 0% throughput commitment.  This way, any one 
part and two part bid over max rate will be evaluated in the same manner.  
This also means that when a user checks the max rate button, a 0% throughput 
commitment will be assumed.

Michelle, I thought I would pass this along to make you aware that now EOG 
isn't going to supply the EFM at their new location.  Given that they have 
yet to contribute the funds requested for our efforts, I don't think we 
should spend the money to put measurement out there until they send us the 
$10,000.  Maybe we should ammend the interconnect agreement to change the 
estimate back to the $30,000 we originally requested.

Thanks, Bob

On the EFM / SCADA, I talked to Dirk Ellison with EOG. He contacted Jerry 
Ball and their reply was for us to go ahead and get our own equipment. 
Laura's work order doesn't have anything about EFM, only the costs to inspect 
the construction and their connection to our tap valve. Laura will check on 
the responsibility of the EFM equipment tomorrow.

Thanks
Mike

News Briefs:

Chevron and Texaco Agree to $100 Billion Merger

Chevron Corp. and Texaco Inc. announced plans to merge and ChevronTexaco
Corp.

In the merger, Texaco shareholders will receive 0.77 shares of Chevron
common stock for each share of Texaco common stock they own, and Chevron
shareholders will retain their existing shares.  The exchange ratio
represents approximately $64.87 per Texaco share based on Chevron's closing
stock price of $84.25 on October 13.  The exchange ratio represents an 18%
premium based upon Texaco's closing share price on October 13, and a 25%
premium based upon the two companies' average relative share prices during
the 30-day period through October 13.  As a result of the merger, Chevron
shareholders will own approximately 61% of the combined equity, and Texaco
shareholders will own about 39%.  The combined company would have an
enterprise value of more than $100 billion.

The new company will have reserves of 11.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent
(BOE), daily production of 2.7 million BOE, assets of $77 billion, and
operations throughout the world.  In the U.S.,  ChevronTexaco would be the
nation's third largest producer of oil and gas, with production of 1.1
million BOE per day, and hold the nation's third largest reserve position,
with 4.2 billion BOE of proved reserves.
