KITCHEN, LOUISE:
 
Attached below you will find the final Evaluation forms for your direct reports; these forms have been pre-populated with your employees' basic data. If you have already completed your employees' final Evaluations, you may disregard these forms. 
 
When completing the Evaluation, carefully consider employee input, consolidated feedback and your observations of their performance and contribution, and encourage employee participation in the evaluation discussion. For many employees, this will be the only formal opportunity to discuss their performance with their supervisor.  
 
Final Evaluations should be completed and returned to your HR representative by August 17 (July 31 for all those in Business Units reporting to Enron Europe) for employees in job groups below Vice President level. 
 
If you have any questions, please contact your HR representative or the PEP help desk at x34777, option 4.

Louise,

You treated me with a degree of candor and respect this morning that was really refreshing to me, although, I must admit that you caught me off-guard.  If you give me the chance, I will be a leader in your organization.  There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that I can generate the new ideas and the new business that you require of a top performing Vice President.  In fact I am dying to get a chance to prove to you that I can deliver results.  I don't want to loose any more time than I already have; I want to start now.

As you don't know well some of the people who's names I gave you as references,  you might also want to try Scott Neal or Don Black.  Both of them know me quite well and would give you an opinion on my ability to deliver what you are looking for.

Thank you for the opportunity.

Steve

Mary,

PwC has introduced a deferred compensation scheme to Louise Kitchen that would allow UK foreign nationals to defer income tax free under certain circumstances.  They will be sending over details on Monday.  The idea would involve the existing Enron deferred compensation plans.  Let us know who we should work with on your team.  We will be moving quickly on this.

Regards,

Attached is an invitation to the Summer Picnic this Saturday, June 23 from 4:00-9:00 pm at the Regal Ranch.  Many of you may have already received this, but I wanted to extend my personal invitation to you.  This is a really fun activity, and has traditionally been one of the best opportunities to visit with our Program participants on an informal basis.  This is a family outing with lots of activities for the kids, and you can come and go as you please.

Please make an effort to attend on Saturday, even if you can only join us for a little while.  Feel free to pass this invitation on to other executives in your business unit.  The Analysts and Associates tell us that this type of exposure to our business leaders helps drive excitement and enthusiasm within the Program.  Your support of events like this is incredibly valuable, and appreciated.

If you can join us, please rsvp to Jackie Coleman by email, or at extension x54070.

Thank you,
Billy

He's on the Executive Impact & Influence course on 6th & 7th November and Marcello being Marcello has been a bit tardy in selecting his raters (well, I actually ended up doing once he'd told me who to pick!).

The thing is because he's picked the minimum no. of raters it's important that those few give the feedback on him - yep you've guessed it, you're one of the few.

Apparently the feedback needs to be done by Tuesday so please may I ask you to do your best to give feedback on him.

Thank you and I hope you & the family are all well

Kevin,

I understand that you had a draft on Lloyd Will delivered to you Friday. On Dorland you had executable copies delivered this morning.

Juan, Don and Narsima are new to me. My understanding from Louise is that you would like us to recommend terms to draft contracts for each of them which I am happy to do but I will ask Kim to help make sure they are consistent with others of their level. Kim, lets discuss. I understand these people are direct support for power.

On Dana, I defer to the 2 of you.

David

What is status of contracts for Chis Dorland, Lloyd Will, Juan Hernandez, Don Baughman, and Narsima Misra?  In addition, are we planning on responding to Dana's counter?  It seems appropriate to at least respond in some fashion.   No response does not send a very good message.

We have been assigned 24 new Associates, 26 new Anaysts, 8 summer Associates and 8 summer Analysts from the incoming class.

Please let me know your needs with respect to numbers.   Louise and I will then decide if we agree and then we will create a process to pick from the ones we have assigned to us.  I'm assuming that Calgary, Toronto and Portland have done their own thing and don't need any of these people (let me know if this is incorrect).  

If you received this and you report to someone else on this list (ie. you don't report to the office of the chair) please cooridinate your needs with your supervisor.

Please respond prompty,


John

Enron's Sports Marketing Group is reviewing proposals from outside vendors for the 2002 Super Bowl and The Masters.  In order to negotiate the best possible customer entertainment packages, I need to determine the interest level within EA, EIM and EGM for participation in these two major sporting events.  On behalf of your perspective companies, please let me know if you are interested in participating and if so, how many spaces you will require for each.

Once we determine the interest level corporate-wide and we negotiate the costs, a detailed outline of these events will be distributed to each of you for your final approval.
Thank you for your assistance.

Marcus said you wanted to see me Friday but we are going to the Astros - is there a problem?  I notice you haven't responded to me email.

Can we talk on the phone or will sometime over the week-end do instead of Friday?

Bloody good effort - I thought you'd have lost a lot of systems.

So how are things - thanks for the message only got it last night as the phones have been down most of the week-end.  We spent the week-end figuring out alternative ways home for Marcus's mum (Indianappolis - New York - London is how she finally got home - obviously her luggage got lost) and also picking up my parents who are now out golfing every hour god sends as no-one else thinks the courses are open.  No other damage though.

What's my news - nothing exciting - Lavo did ring last week to tell me that everyone is saying I am going back to London, David Port rang Friday and said there were many rumours around (some not so nice too!).  But suffice to say I presume they are all bollocks as no-one has mentioned anything to me!  But then maybe I'll be the last person to get consulted.  Matthew Scrimshaw made the move to EBS so I do have some info there - but I figure you'll already know it as its now 4 days old!    I have never been more up to speed with emails - I only have 5 in my inbox

In other news - Scott is finally sleeping more (I got a whole 7 hours last night) so I am back at work on Monday - are you free any time this week for lunch to catch me up on the gossip before I get back?  I could never be a stay at home mum -  I am lacking in all the requried attributes - patience and inability to spend money, with nothing to do apart  from look after Scott - I have become the demon internet spotter.

Let me know about lunch

Regards

Louise

Bill/Philippe-

Below is a summary of the major problems which occurred the past 96 hours and the steps taken to mitigate the damage and risk.

Enron Center North (1400 Smith)

As a result of the flooding downtown, approximately six skyscrapers had their electrical vaults flooded and began to cause cascading problemd in the electrical grid downtown. The net result was the loss of one of the two 35kv circuits which serve 1400 Smith. We (engineers, EES Maint, electrical subs)  believe at the time the circuits blew we shifted from three phase to single phase power, which caused an imbalance in the load to the building. 

Consequently, UPS "C" which serves a portion of the Lv 34 Data Ctr, the Rolm phone switch, and a protion of the Traders floors lost a circuitboard, and blew two internal fuses. This power degradation caused PDU "S" on Lv 34 to trip its main breaker and shutdown power load to servers and equipment on this PDU. This occurred shortly after Noon on Saturday.

Response/Restoration

> UPS "D" transferred load from UPS "C" as the N+1 back up and carried the full load of the UPS loss as designed
> EPSC/electrical sub (Henderson Electric); EES Maint; IT worked together to power down systems to begin repair work by 4:00pm Saturday
> EPSC/EES Maint coordinated with Pillar/Henderson Elec to obtain replacement parts and begin the repairs. By 9:30pm all repairs to UPS"C" had been made and the system bought back on line. As a measure of extra protection the back up genset for Enron Ctr North  was in operation
> Reliant Energy restored the circuit at approximately 10:30pm Saturday evening
> EPSC/EES Maint and subs conducted a thorough review of all electrical and back up systems Saturday evening
> Enron Network IT Operations began restoration of all affected systems Saturday evening
> EPSC/EES Maint obtained diesel fuel and topped off all gensets Saturday in case of additional problems and due to fuel consumption during the outage

Other Building damage was limited to flooding in the tunnels, and water damage/flooding to portions of the Body Shop on Lv B-1

Enron Center South (1500 Louisiana)

Impact/Damage Summary

> Levels 8 & 9  received very limited amounts of water from the core area elevator shafts and exterior curtainwall. There was no exposure to water on any systems or network cabling during the entire period. (Response) Crews contained and cleaned all water as it traced into the building.
> ALL IDF closets on Lvs 3-5 Traders Floors remained dry throughout the duration of the rains/flooding on Friday & Saturday
> Lv 6 received some water from Lv 7. (Response) The area was contained and cleaned. No additional damage beyond Tuesday evenings flooding occurred
> Due to extreme street flooding and water pressure, a 10" sanitary sewer line tied into ECS burst on Friday evening causing extensive flooding of Lv  B-1 area (approximately 4-6 inches of water in the basement. (Response)  Clark & Way Engr was able to install a temporary plug in the line to stop the on going flood waters from penetrating the basement. Clean up has continued throughout the weekend   
> Due to the extreme flooding and water pressure, the water seal of the Reliant Vault burst early Saturday and flooded the electrical vault room with 24-30" of water. This resulted in a complete loss of power at approximately 1:30pm on Staurday afternoon. The back up systems engaged and operated per design to support the Data Ctr and Traders Floors. The temporary cooling tower went off line. Prior to the flooding Clark had been in the process of tieing in the temporary feed into the back up system by 7-1-01 in prep for the migration (Response) 
	* Clark used back up water pumps to pump out and clean the Reliant electrical vault, as well as maintained operation of the back up systems
	* The Data Ctr AHU's were kept on line with the dehumidifiers/blowers to modulate the airflow in the Data Ctr. EPSC had Way Engr techs use temp/humidity probes
	   to monitor the areas. The recordings indicated temps on Lvs 8 & 9 did not exceed 78 degrees and relative humidity did not exceed 68% during the outage
	* Clark/Fisk Elec/EPSC coordinated desing efforts and obtained gear on an emergency basis and completed the tie in off the temporary coolong tower to the 
	   generators by 10:30pm
	* Reliant Energy is still cleaning and replacing gear in th vault room. Presntly (AT 11:00PM Sunday) we have one circuit operational in the building and 50% of the
              Reliant  gear on line). We are still operating all systems safely on the back up sytems for the past 36 hours. It is expected Relaint will be complete by 7:00am.
	  Clark; the engineers and MEP subs shall be conducting a thorough system review and repirs as required of all systems throughout the building during the coming
	  week.

In summary, the back up systems in both facilities did engage and operate as designed; however, due to the extreme conditons and stress placed upon the systems the facility held up extremely well. I would also like to note throughout the ordeal beginning Friday evening through Sunday, everyone (Enron NetWorks;EES FacilitiesClark Const;Way Engring;Fisk Electric;Henderson Electric; KW-Pillar;Hines) did an outstanding job under enourmous pressure and the most severe conditions I have seen in downtown Houston. Communication, around the clock work  and cool heads managed to assess damage and develop action/restoration plans to facilitate repairs for Monday business

Let me know if you need further details on specific issues or items.

regards-

Henry

Welcome back!   I wanted to send you this note to let you know we are planning to hold the Commercial Support PRC Meeting for  ENA tomorrow, June 21, 2001 at 2pm at the Hyatt in the Cottonwood Room.  The following peer groups will be discussed:


Specialist
Sr. Specialist
Commercial Support Manager
Commercial Support Sr. Director

Admin roles will not be discussed.

The primary areas I see going into the meeting that may stimulate discussion historically have been the Sr Specialist callibration and the promotion nominations in this group. Promotion nominations will ultimately be subject to Office of the Chair approval.  

While I believe it would be advantageous to have you present in the meeting, your attendance is optional.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Catherine has been in Global inance for Enron Americas for the past year. She has been ranked a Category 1 during year-end 2000 and mid-year 2001 PRC. She is responsible for the financial modeling of all the greenfield project development opportunities being pursued by Origination. She has learned to articulate the banks' concerns with the projects and equipment to be financed within E-Next and other structures to both the originators and accounting. The successful effort Origination has had this year with developments has provided tremendous document flow which has allowed Catherine to develop her document review skills from both a financing and commercial perspective. The growth in maturity she has experienced driven by her deal flow has made her one of the core "go to" junior people in my group when a deal calls for financial analysis. She has been performing at the manager level for six months and is seen as a leader among the junior staff in the group.

Louise and John will be reviewing these early next week.  Since Catherine is eligible and has a 1 rating I do not believe this will be an issue.  

Louise has requested that each manager write a brief statement about why the employee should be promoted.  Please submit it to me by noon tomorrow if possible.  I apologise for the late notice.  The need for a written summary just came up.  If this is an issue, just let me know and we can resolve another way.  Thanks.

Below are the final PRC rankings for the Analysts and /or Associates who were assigned to you for the mid-year PRC process.  Please communicate these results to the appropriate supervisor.  PRC reviews with the Analysts and Associates should be completed by early August, and the signed evaluation forms should be returned to me at EB3539b.  The Program recommends that if asked, the supervisor should provide the actual ranking to the Analyst or Associate.  In addition, we recommend that the PRC representative be involved in providing feedback to the Analyst or Associate.

Mark/Greg,

Attached is a detailed report on the status on completed performance reviews across EWS (excluding EEL - who had 95% of their completed by 7/31). In brief, here are the headlines:

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES					
 					
	Enron Americas	1078	432	40.1%	
	Enron Broadband Services, Inc	822	180	21.9%	
	Enron Canada Corp	107	38	35.5%	
	Enron Engineering & Operational Services	968	161	16.6%	
	Enron Global Markets	363	124	34.2%	
	Enron Industrial Markets	192	72	37.5%	
 	Enron Net Works	1560	680	43.6%	
	Enron Wholesale Services	13	1	7.7%	
	Wholesale EES	35	29	82.9%	
					
 	EWS - Consolidated	5138	1717	33.4%	


Our target was to have all evaluations completed by August 31 (we had hoped that all below VP's would be done by August 17). At year end we achieved close to 90% completion of written evaluations. The HR team are working hard to help their clients get these finalised, but I would appreciate all of your help in chasing this process to a successful conclusion.

 

David

Louise and Marcus,

Received the new Approval Notice with Marcus' name spelled correctly this week.  No action required as the new visa stamp has already been obtained.

PwC, the compensation team and I met this week regarding the proposed deferred compensation scheme.  An issue was raised for PwC to research before moving forward.  Will keep you updated.

Louise and Marcus,

As a reminder, we will be in a holding pattern for the green cards as follows:

	-The Multinational Manager Application was filed for Louise on December 4, 2000.  Approval will take four to 	  twelve months.

	-The Labor Certification was filed for Marcus on December 8, 2000.  The Department of Labor will not respond 	  before one year and may take up to two years to respond.

I need Louise to send over a copy of her new social security card received in the mail and her new prescription card.

The Compensation Team and I had a conference call with PwC on Monday regarding the deferred compensation scheme.  The Compensation Team forwarded copies of the various plans to PwC for review.  We expect something from PwC next week.

Regards,

I ordered the nanny packet!  I finally spoke with a live body, who seemed knowledgeable and helpful.  In order to avoid confusion I had it sent to my home address and will expedite it to you upon receipt, which should be five days.

We were thinking of having another interview session for the Trading Tract later this month.   I've been screening outside resumes but internally we haven't received many suggestions from each of you about other people already at Enron.  If you think anyone could qualify send the name to Karen Buckley.  If we don't have enough candidates, we will wait until the new analysts and associates arrive and do a session then.

We're sorry that the three of you (has kind of a nice feel to it - doesn't
it) could not join us last night.  It was great to see everyone, and
Marcello even made a guest appearance.

Thank you very much for the generous act of having Rahil pick up the check.
It was just another example of how well I have been treated by Enron
throughout my career.

Please send me an e-mail or give us a call (713) 622 6257, and let us know
if there would be a good time for us to stop by for a quick visit.  We are
available either this week or over the long weekend, and would love the
chance to meet Scott and say goodbye (for now only).

Dave

Louise,

Are we ok to go forward on Neil?  Last time we talked you seemed ok with internal transfers as long as there was no increase in pay or title.  Not sure on the relocations from London in light of the current situation.  May want to hold on them until things settle down and we know the impact on the Houston staffing.  My guess is that we will have a lot of very strong people in Houston available.

Thanks,

Robert

Robert -

Are we still OK to move forward with internal transfers?  Neil is in Houston, Elizabeth is an American who rotated most recently to London, and I can't seem to find Posey in SAP (so not sure of her status!).

Thanks!

Amy -

Can you confirm whether we have put a hold on all internal transfers.  I heard this but wanted to confirm.  I have been approached by several very dtrong people in other groups and I do think we need to address how we handle in light of any potential upcoming reductions.

Specifically, there is one individual still in Broadband, Neil Carpino, that everyone would like to have join Berney/Edith/Terry.  There are two individuals in Europe, Posey Martinez and Elizabeth Johnston that would be good fits as well.  I am holding off on all moves until there is more clarity.

Any info or insight you might provide would be helpful.

Thanks,
RH

As Brian is away on vacation, I thought you may be able to assist me.

Brian Redmond does not have responsibilities in his profile for the MD prc.  I took Laura Luce's profile and changed the region to Texas and added Tech Services.  Do you think this is appropriate or can you offer any changes?

Subject:	EWS Weekly Report of Outstanding Reviews and NI/Issues Employees


The stats for this week are attached.

	We have made some improvement over last week's totals by decreasing the number of outstanding reviews from 802 to 591.  The greatest improvement was in ESA.  However, with time running out on the 3/31/01 deadline, we are still considerably short of attaining 100% of the reviews returned to HR.  The following are the counts of reviews still outstanding: ENW 99 or 9%, EIM 18 or 16%, CALME 29 or 20%, ESA 52 or 22%, ENA 253 or 23%, EGM 87 or 25%, Apachi 53 or 41%.  

Over the last week Elisa Tamez and I have contacting many of you to offer assistance in calling delinquent supervisors.  Please let us know if we can provide any further assistance.  As well please continue to provide input of employees that should not be considered in the reporting, i.e.(voluntary terminations, employees on FMLA, special circumstances in international regions, etc.)



Thanks,

Cindy/Philip

Thanks for approving the Portland promotions.  I think that they all are very deserving and it goes a long way to making people feel like they are getting recognized for the accomplishments of this office.  It is very helpful having your support on that.

The A&A program are running a "magnificent Monday" April 30th to intervier 26 Analysts (summer start dates).    Therefore a number of interviewers have been requested.

Monday am:				20 Interviewers
Monday pm:				8 Interviewers

Can you advise if you or a manager/director in your group can faciliate.     No doubt, those that take the time to interview will have first "dips" on the analysts who get offered.

Thanks,

Karen.

Louise - Do you know this gentleman from your days in London?   His resume looks good and he is interested in moving to Houston and working in East Power.
 
John Suarez - You are going to need at least one and probably two solid cash/term traders for the SE region.   Talk to Seresh about this guy.

Subject:  Confidential Information and Securities Trading
 
To keep pace with the fluid and fast-changing demands of our equity trading activities, Enron Wholesale Services ("EWS") has recently revised its official Policies and Procedures Regarding Confidential Information and Securities Trading ("Policies and Procedures").  These revisions reflect two major developments: (1) our equity trading activities have been extended into the United Kingdom, and (2) in an effort to streamline the information flow process, the "Review Team" will play a more centralized role, so that the role of the "Resource Group" is no longer necessary.You are required to become familiar with, and to comply with, the Policies and Procedures.  The newly revised Policies and Procedures are available for your review on LegalOnline, the new intranet website maintained by the Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department.  Please click on the attached link to access LegalOnline:
 http://legalonline.corp.enron.com/chinesewall.asp 
 
If you have already certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, you need not re-certify at this time, although you are still required to to review and become familiar with the revised Policies and Procedures.  If you have not certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, then you must do so within two weeks of your receipt of this message.  The LegalOnline site will allow you to quickly and conveniently certify your compliance on-line with your SAP Personal ID number.  If you have any questions concerning the Policies or Procedures, please call Bob Bruce at extension 5-7780 or Donna Lowry at extension 3-1939.

Louise -

I checked with Tammie last week and she indicated that you have been receiving checks for your expenses through October 31, 2001.  As of November 1, 2001, Tammie has requested that your expenses be direct deposited.

Can you please confirm that this is the case?  

Thanks -
Amy

You have been selected to serve on the 2001 VP Performance Review committee.  This selection is based on your performance and recognizing that you possess the behaviors we are trying to underline, encourage and reward through our PRC process.

In serving on the committee we'd like to underscore the important role you will play not only  with respect to the VP PRC, but also in setting the standards and guidance for PRC's across Enron.

The PRC is the foundation on which our talent is managed and rewarded.  Therefore, it is critical that you give it your full attention, prepare appropriately, and serve as champions for the process from an overall Enron perspective.

A meeting of the PRC Committee is scheduled for  April 3, 2001, in the Enron Building 50th Floor Boardroom to discuss mid-year 2001 PRC.  Tele-conference/Video conference will be provided where appropriate.

An agenda for the meeting is attached for your review and information.

 

Please contact Gina Corteselli (713-345-3377) or Jackie Martin ( 713-345-3563) to confirm your participation.

Regards,


Dave

Louise, 
Do you want Lloyd and Fred to obtain construction drawings (CD's) so that a project estimate can be generated on the ROC?  The CD's will run between $25 - 45,000.

Thanks,
Tammy

I spoke with Wayne.  He was reporting to Brian Redmond.  He is now reporting to me.  He is happy with that.  He has 10 direct reports.  I will notify HR, Accounting, etc. of the change unless you want me to hold off.

Dear Ms. Kitchen,

I am currently working as a V.P. at Commerce One managing the Global Trading
Web.  I have followed Enron's e-commerce activities for some time.  I am
currently exploring other career opportunities and thought I might be able
to contribute to Enron's online initiative.  I previously worked at the
House Energy and Commerce Committee, the FCC, the State Dept, and Jones, Day
Reavis & Pogue.  I not only have experience in the B2B world through my work
at Commerce One, but also in e-commerce generally, trade and
telecommunications through these other positions.  This combination of
experience could be helpful to Enron in expanding your B2B effort, including
governance and interoperability issues, developing new business, and in
dealing with domestic and international regulatory matters related to
e-commerce.

A copy of my resume is attached.  If you have a few moments to talk, I would
greatly appreciate it.

Thanks and best regards,

Ed

Hello Louise,

Enrico worked for me for 1 year as an new associate. He was weak when he started but got better with time. When I finally lost him I was disappointed but then he was focused on the Italian market and had become very pro-active after I gave him a consistent hard time. I rate him mid range and solid. Not a superstar - so it depends what you need.

I take it Suarez took the Presto job. He is bright and should do well.

Call me when you get in, I'd like a chat.

Later,
M

In addition, Jared Kaiser is returning from EGM and will take over the lead Origination role in the Southeast as we have discussed.

There are some major issues with moving Drew at this time and I am sure you and Dave need to discuss this further.  I would suggest if he were to move he moves into Don's new group as opposed to Corporate Development.

But essentially the timing is very bad.

Greg has asked if I would help arrange 1 hour individual meetings with the OTC of each EWS BU to discuss the relative performance of each of your commercial MD's and VP's so far this year. The intent is to give Greg a general understanding of how you would rate your MD and VP slates on a continuum of top through bottom (i.e. ignoring the PRC 1 thru 5 scale but instead listing number 1 thru number 10 if you have 10 VP's).

In recognising that this may seem like an additional burden over and above the various PRC discussion we have already committed to, I would encourage you to avoid spending any significant time in preparing for this discussion, aside from ensuring you have a complete picture of all your commercial VP's and MD's and then listing them down quickly as above.

I will call your respective HR leads and ask them to help by providing you with the initial slate. I believe Liz will call to arrange a convenient time for you to meet with Greg at some point before the end of next week.

David

Mary,

PwC has introduced a deferred compensation scheme to Louise Kitchen that would allow UK foreign nationals to defer income tax free under certain circumstances.  They will be sending over details on Monday.  The idea would involve the existing Enron deferred compensation plans.  Let us know who we should work with on your team.  We will be moving quickly on this.

Louise & Marcus,

Immigrate Visas
The attorney's have advised that the Approval Notice has still not been received.

Deferred Comp
Tim Callahan has a meeting with PricewaterhouseCoopers today regarding deferred comp.  You will be advised as soon as I have results of their meeting.

Richard Frank
I understand Rick has touched base with you regarding the tax preparation issue for employing Scott's nanny.  Please let me know if you need anything else from me and if everything is going okay.

Nanny
I contacted the nanny's former employer twice on Tuesday, 3 July.  I didn't want to leave a message on the answering machine.  Therefore, I will try again this evening.

Scott
Birth Certificates obtained today.  Information to you regarding US passport in process.  

Cheers!

Welcome Summer!
Best Regards,
Bobbi

Hi Louise.
I received this spreadsheet from Gemma Butler in London which shows all Director-level and above employees for EEL.
No filters are currently active, and all Female employees are at the top.

 

Unfortunately, myself and Jean have limited knowledge of the people in the international offices.
Would you be able to identify possible candidates for us?
Here is a breakdown of the current state of the presentation...

Females:
8 Commercial, 1 EEL
6 CS/ ST, no EEL

Males:
10 Commercial, 4 EEL
6 CS/ST, no EEL (primarily have ST).

I think we need a few additional Commercial Females, and a few Male & Female CS candidates to give us a balanced portfolio.
Although I think the London office will be closed by the time I get the names to them today, we should have their data by early next week.
Also, I have included a spreadsheet which includes the career data for the employees Marcello Romano identified, as well as a few others.
There does not appear to be the type of candidates you are wanting, but i'll let you make the call.

 

Thanks,

Sunjay

Miss Louise,

Welcome to being a parent!!!!  It only gets better!!!  How are you doing??  I will respond with proper information later.  However, you really haven't said if you are doing well?  Did everything go okay?  Please call if you have a moment to visit.  My cell number is 713 516 7299 and home is 281 358 5732.  Do you have family visiting to help you?  

When you are ready to share Scott, please feel free to let me know and we can have "y'all" over to our house for dinner.  This may prove a good break from your usual routine, if you like.  

Welcome Summer!
Best Regards,
Bobbi

Louise,

Birth registry with The Vital Statistics and Records office (the office who issues certified original birth certificates) will not have record of Scott's birth for approximately eight weeks.  We need this document to obtain the UK birth registry and passport.

If you have plans to travel soon/before the birth certificate is available, we can appear in person, with tickets (travel itineraries are not acceptable), information provided by the hospital and obtain it by 4:00pm the day following the application.  I will also need the two items listed in the next paragraph as well.

If you have no immediate travel plans, I have calendared the seventh week (after Scott's birth) to obtain documentation from you, a letter with your signature stating I can receive it on your behalf and a copy of your drivers license.  I will then confirm his birth has been registered and apply on your behalf.

Best Regards,
      Bobbi

Louise and Marcus,

We're still in the waiting period with the green card process.

As a reminder, we'll need the baby's birth certificate from Houston Vital Statistics to start the process of obtaining a US passport and dual citizenship.  Bobbi has some helpful information on traveling with a baby which she will bring over for you.

The compensation team is looking at the US plan issues related to PwCs deferred compensation scheme.

Try to send over a copy of Louise's new social security card this week.  Also, we would like to follow up on your unreimbursed medical claims.

Regards,

My one year anniversary at Enron is June 1st.  At this time, I will be able to apply for transfer into the Analyst Program.  I hope to go back to school in the near future and feel that the Analyst Program along with my Enron experience is the best road to take.  It would be very much appreciated if you would help me in this process by writing a letter of recommendation.  Each of you has been influential to both Enron as a whole and myself.  I could not think of anyone better to represent me in this way.  If you could have this to me by the first week of May, that would be great.

If you need anything from me in this regard, please let me know.   

thank you ,

Adriane

Thank you for your interest in transferring into the program.  In order to transfer you must have at least one year of Enron experience.  Along with your resume we would need three recommendation letters (one from a VP level or higher, one from a current or previous supervisor and the other is your discretion) and a copy of your recent PRC.  You must have a rating of strong or higher on your PRC to be eligible.

The best course of action at this point is to start collecting all this information for your transfer application packet prior to your one year anniversary.  You can submit this information to me about a month from your anniversary date, by having it delivered to EB 1165c.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thanks a bunch!

Louise,

Many thanks. As Christie probably told you, the case was a huge success -
and you were a star!
Thanks again for all your help.

Attached please find information which has been sent to active and inactive deferral plan participants regarding the status of their deferred compensation accounts.   The information consists of a letter which provides details of account balance(s) by plan, life-to-date contributions under most plans, general Q&A's regarding top hat non-qualified deferral plans, the process for preserving a claim with the bankruptcy court and a sample claim form.  We have received many calls and think that this will answer most questions.  Any additional questions regarding deferrals may be forwarded to executive.compensation@enron.com, voice mail 713-345-7960, or to P. O. Box 1188 in care of the Deferral Plan Administration group for a written response.  

We will continue to work with Weil, Gotshal, and Manges LLP to exhaust any reasonable effort as it relates to making payments to the participants of Enron's deferral plans.  

If you have questions, please call me at x35816.

I gave all the signed contract approvals to Kim Melodick as David is out.  I have signed them all but David hasn't.  I have kept all the original numbers as submitted by Chris and expect David to sign on this basis (ie original Chris numbers not David's changes).

Please sort out drafting for Chris.

Thanks

Yes.  Azurix caused us a big headache, because the contract they did in 2000 was weak, but Mike stuck it out, did what we asked him to do to get it done in the end.

Professional
Integrity
Relationship-Oriented
Understands big deal processes - legal, relationship, negotiations, politics, etc.
Would need some hard-core junior commercial people around him - to id the value/risk/arbs in deals

For what ever reason, in the system, he is coded in the executive committee job group.  Your reports only include job groups of MD down to Managers.  Ranabir is coded wrong because he is not an executive committee member and this is why he is not in any of your reports.  I will get with is HR rep and get this corrected. If you would like, in the meantime, I can run the report information on him.

Faith,
Per our discussion, enovate and Central are the same.  enovate/Chicago and Central Desk/Houston should be included in my teams numbers and are reflective of my goals/objectives for the year 2001.  One number should be viewed as Central/Origination.

Thanx,
Laura

It might be quicker to just take the number from the DPR and split it out into a number by originator, as we do need the information for Monday's prc.  The numbers below are the total per region which need dividing up by originator.

Frank		$8,261,000
Enovate	$6,219,000
Laura		$2,357,000
Fred		$19,465,000

Please send back the divided numbers to both Faith and I.

Thanks

Hi Louise,

As requested, attached is a file that contains June YTD Originations by Originator.

We've arranged the file in the following sorts:

?	by team
?	by Originator (sorted alphabetically)
?	by Originator (sorted by value)
?	Top 10 Overall Originators by Value
?	Top 10 Originators- Gas
?	Top 10 Originators- Power

An item to note is that not all deals had a related individual's name (such as Enduser)- we left the listing as it appears in the Risk Book in these cases.

We'll send you an update if the DPR amounts move (the DPR isn't final yet.)

Please let me know if you need any additional information!

Dear Louise and Faith
 
I had a review of the spreadsheet and noticed an error in allocation of value for the Central Maine Power deal.  The $5 MM of orig value for this deal was incorrectly allocated to Jeff Ader.  This value should be allocated to myself and George Wood (Woody), who worked with me on the deal.   As for the appropriate split between me and Woody, I think Dave Duran and Ed Baughman should make the call on that (i believe both Dave and Ed are on holiday this week).
 
In addition, I had one other deal that did not make it next to my name.  This deal involved selling ICAP in NEPOOL to New England Power Company and had orig value of $40,000.   I am trying to find a deal number for this.  As we discussed Faith, it is possible that the deal for $40k under Jeff Ader's name is in fact this deal, in which case this value should be reallocated to me.
 
Regards
John

	Hi Louise,

	As requested, attached is a file that contains June YTD Originations by Originator.

	We've arranged the file in the following sorts:

	?       by team

	?       by Originator (sorted alphabetically)

	?       by Originator (sorted by value)

	?       Top 10 Overall Originators by Value

	?       Top 10 Originators- Gas

	?       Top 10 Originators- Power

	An item to note is that not all deals had a related individual's name (such as Enduser)- we left the listing as it appears in the Risk Book in these cases.

	We'll send you an update if the DPR amounts move (the DPR isn't final yet.)

	Please let me know if you need any additional information!

We would like to hire Willis Phillips from Koch.   Rogers, Dana, & I have all interviewed him and think he is a can't miss candidate.   The bad news is that he was referred by a headhunter (the fee is 20% of first year package).

This guy is quality and I want to make an offer.   Please let me know if I can proceed ASAP.

Ms. Kitchen,

  Thank you for your response and the wise words to read more HBS studies!  I appreciate your honest answers and sound advice.  I am extremely interested in Enron Broadband for opportunities this fall.  Do you know of anyone there I could talk to about roles for MBA's, opportunities, the culture, and what roles MBA's play?  Thanks again for your time and I look forward to talking with you more.

Sincerely,

Chad Storlie

<<< "Kitchen, Louise" <Louise.Kitchen@enron.com>  7/31  5:14p >>>
Chad,

Answers to questions (clearly not Enron answers but my own personal
views)

1. The areas you are looking at are not directly commercial and this
should be something you consider.  Essentially you may wish to consider
a consultancy company which is much more akin to your interests which
are not our core competencies.  You need to decide whether you wish to
pursue a commercial career or not - decide what your risk profile is, a
consultant role is low reward, low risk and commercial player has a
high/risk reward profile.
2. Driven, enthusiastic, hard working, highly analytical, personable and
motivated.
3. Not having an MBA personally, I find this one simple to answer.  Too
much occupation with trying to apply theory to practice / not seeing the
wood for the trees (english expression).
4. Get some practical experience.
5. More case studies (Harvard Business).

Good Luck.

John/Louise

Attached is the final spreadsheet outlining hires/no hires.     Currently we have 15 selected for hire.       However the two with questions were discussed as good hires and perhaps should be looked at again (both external candidates - Tom Martin's group).

I will circle around with you today to discuss further - so we can proceed with offers with your approval.

Thanks, Karen.


Ps - our external candidates did very well.

Subject:	Kitchen/Nettleton tax and misc issues

David

Further to our conversation last week, I have managed to get some information that I hope will be useful for Louise, although I am still unclear about the exact circumstances/issues.

1)There should not be a problem with Louise's 2000 return in terms of her name. Nettleton was listed on the return and Kitchen was listed on the estimated payment vouchers. As long as the social security numbers are the same, it is unlikely that there will be any issue with the IRS but if they do come back to Lousie asking for clarification, PwC will write them a letter explaining the situation and that will be it.

2)Issues with Louise's 2001 return. If possible, PwC Houston suggest that if Louise's social security card says Nettleton (still not sure about this as PwC do not ask for copies of the SS cards), then any information that the company sends to the IRS must also list her name as Nettleton. Louise's US payroll has the name Kitchen and thus W2 will have the name Kitchen. If she would like to change her name and the company documents, she can do this via a form on the web http://isc.enron.com/dynamic/hrforms/HR%20Form-Personal%20Data%20Change.doc.  

3)In order for Louise to change her name to Nettleton in the UK, according to Julie this is what needs to happen: "We only require a certified copy of the marriage certificate, and then both London HR service and Enron London payroll should be notified. The service centre should change her name, payroll will advise the providers, such as shareplan, and benefits".  PwC London have confirmed that if Louise wishes to change her name to Nettleton with the UK tax office, they will be happy to write a letter on her behalf advising them as such. They will await her confirmation before doing so, though.

Chuck - if any of the above is incorrect of if you wish to add anything, please do so asap so that David can get back with Louise.

Regards
Tara

I have talked to Paul again, and he is keen to work in Toronto wholesale origination.  I propose that he starts October 15 as he needs to clean his plate in the UK first.  He will be contacting Brad Richter today to confirm his intent.  Brad knows he was talking to us.  

Rob:
1.  He comes well recommended by Louise
2.  I talked with him a couple times and he seems very personable and capable
3.  I think we should hire him reporting to Borg.  Borg needs additional commercial people to completely cover the market

Dawn, on Rob's say so, please create an offer letter and E-mail to him.  I will send salary proposal on a separate E-mail to you.  You will also need to work out relocation costs from the UK.

Cheers, Paul D

Paul Goddard is a manager in the London office looking to come home to Canada (Calgary or Toronto) and has spoken to Paul in Toronto.  Paul is a strong manager who has been in the organisation for several years.  I know that Paul has a position offer in Dynegy (from Pope obviously).  I think that it would be good for you to have a chat with him to see if there is a fit as I wouldn't want to lose him.  At the moment, he seems very keen on Toronto and working in power retail - he definitely doesn't want to leave Enron.

His number is +44 7748 932298

Thanks

Louise

Louise:

I have hired an EES Manager (Nick Politis) to fill a mid-market role in East Power. Subsequent to hiring the candidate, I learned from Kim Melodick that you and/or Lavo may want to screen all commercial hires before extending offers. I spoke with Dave Duran before extending the offer. It is Dave's understanding that you and John L. will screen Director level and above. Mr. Politis was interviewed by 6 commercial people from E. Power. Please let me know if you have a problem with this issue. In addition, if you could provide guidance on commercial hiring protocol, I would appreciate it. Hope this isn't an inconvenience.

Regards,   Ed

I am making good progress.  I have met with Mike, Matt, Bob, and Jeff.  It =
sounds like Mike is done, the rest are close.  I told each of them that thi=
s is a "fill or kill" bid.  If they like it then we'll get done, if not the=
n we can revisit at the end of their existing contracts.  I also told each =
of them that if the market changes between now and then that it's their ris=
k.  I also said that if they value keeping their options open that they bet=
ter figure out some way to monetize their theta as Enron would not be in a =
position to make them whole for what they would have been paid had they cho=
sen not to keep their options open.

I still have a couple of issues.  One is Greg Wolfe.  I am thinking that hi=
s package should look quite similar to Motley's.  I need to show him number=
s today and would like to talk with one or both of you about it before I ta=
lk to Greg.  I want to show him numbers for a two-year and a three-year con=
tract.  He is currently talking to AEP, Calpine, and Arizona Public Service=
.  He is asking for a lot of money to stay:  Base of 200, signing of 100, a=
nnual retention of 100 plus equity of 600 with a two year vest.  He would a=
lso do a 3 year deal with equity of 800 with a three year vest.  I have tal=
ked a little bit with Mike S. about how important Wolfe is to the Northwest=
 Middle Market effort.  The answer was that he is really important because =
he knows all of the customers, he knows Enron's internal process, and he is=
 very good at working with Mike to get deals executed and papered properly.=
  Having said that, Mike said that he supports whatever decision I come up =
with in terms of retaining Wolfe -- in other words, if he leaves then he le=
aves and Mike is ok with that.

I'd like to talk to one of you this afternoon to hear your thoughts and ide=
as on this.  I'll give you a call.

Louise -

Tammie has checked and all but one of your expense checks for 2001 have been cashed.  Tammie indicated that you should have received a check mid-September in the amount of $4,069.72 for your last expense reimbursement claim - this check has not been cashed as of yet.

Do you still have it or would you like to have Tammie get it reissued?

Thanks!
Amy

What is status of contracts for Chis Dorland, Lloyd Will, Juan Hernandez, Don Baughman, and Narsima Misra?  In addition, are we planning on responding to Dana's counter?  It seems appropriate to at least respond in some fashion.   No response does not send a very good message.

Please let me know if you need detailed info on vesting. 

The Vested and Unvested values were determined with a $51.00 current Stock Price.  The values do include the grants provided on 1/22/01.  If you received any grants after 1/22/01, I'm not aware of them -- just let me know the grant date or other info and I'll get all the detailed info.

Can you do me a favor when you have a minute,  I am doing a will and need details of my stocks and options and I wanted to check out that I have everything included as I do not information on all of it (particularly a recent tranche).  Can you email me a spreadsheet (usual password) or if that is too much of a problem just the nominal values of vested and unvested at current Enron stock prices.

Thanks

Michelle,								

See below. Lets see how many we can get Louise by 12-1pm

Presto's needs to chnage to 1/3 1/3 1/3 grants rather than all next week, so hold his back.

Louise, Michelle and I just spoke and she is checking the drafts that were prepared this weekend and making some changes. You will have them in batches during course of the afternoon. Obviously these are drafts and will need to be redone before anyone can sign (and potentially changed to modify strike date language in case they elect that option). In addition, I thought we were only focusing on the first 15 names on John's spreadsheet at least for this 2 day exercise? Your list below includes a number further down. I thought we agreed we could hold off on them until next week? I don't think we will be able to get all the 46 done over next 2 days and would recommend we focus initially on top 15 or so.

Kari/Sheila, please be on point to ferry these forms back and forth today and tomorrow. We need someone to focus purely on this for the next 48 hours.

David

All,

Further to your recent discussions surrounding the ENA Origination Track I will shortly be scheduling an interview date for you to interview recommended candidates.    You have already received the attached list of suggested candidates and as I understand it you have no comments on these individuals thus far.   

In order to match the success of the ENA Trading Track it requires your 100% commitment and participation in the following areas:

1.	Interviewing
2.	Training
3.	Mentoring
4.	Promotion of the Track

I will contact each supervisor of the attached list of candidates to gain further feedback on these candidates, prior to contacting them, and ensure their respective buy-in.

 
If you have any questions please call me.

I look forward to working with you on this Track.

Kind regards,

Karen Buckley

The general consensus is that it would be best to run the offsite on a Saturday.  So far however, there does not seem to be any Saturdays in September that everyone is available.  We are therefore going to try and aim for Sat 6th October.  Could you please let me know as soon as possible whether will be able to make this date. 

Any questions, please call me (x35419)

As mentioned in Joe's note, we are currently setting up departmental offsites.  This will be an opportunity for you all to get together and discuss how your group plan to achieve its goals and vision.  Ideally this will be held on a week day, however, market and business demands may mean running it on a Saturday.

If possible, please let me know your availability over the next few weeks.  Louise Kitchenham will also be contacting you to follow this up.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Thanks

- Dave is incredibly valuable to our business.
- He lives in the most expensive city in the country.
- He has made Enron $90MM, most of which could not have closed if he lived in Houston or Portland.
- He is sitting on (like the rest of us) a lot of out of the money calls.

I think the following is appropriate:

Base: $200 + $15 COLA
Signing: $100
Equity: $300 (50/50)

Louise -

David Parquet is currently on an employment agreement which expires on 12/1/2001.  Chris would like to be proactive in signing Dave up again for another 2 years.  

Dave's current contract details are:

Base:		$200,000 (due to SF cost of living)
Equity:		$100,000 equity (50/50) on 1/1/00
Equity:		$100,000 equity (50/50) on 1/1/01

Chris is proposing:

Base:  		$215,000 (or $200,000 with a COLA payment of $15,000 for each year of term)
Signing: 	$100,000
Equity:		$350,000 (50/50)

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks!

I'm happy to take their names off the list, but are we sure this is the right thing to do?

If so should I put any new names in their place?

I've allowed one person to enter Enron America into Jacoby's group from Broadband.  We need to be very selective because Broadband and EES will have people who will be put into redeployment.  I expect Louise or I to approve any employee who enters Enron America.  I will accept no exuses if someone slips in.

OK. I am aware of where EBS are and will monitor closely.

I presume you are referring to Commercial staff mainly.

I had some preliminary discussions with Greg W about where EWS stood on this. It seemed that ENW may be the target for many.My understanding is the vast majority of these are technology people (allegedly). Robert Jones and Phillippe and Greg Piper are on the ball.

So who was that crazy woman beating on the glass?

It was great seeing you again. Sorry we weren't able to catch up in Chicago. 

As I said, I'm relocating to Houston. We'll be moving the Anderson gang down here next week. 

I'll be working in Enron Freight Markets. The learning curve is pretty vertical for now, but it's a great opportunity for me.

Got any time to get together in the near future? I'd love to catch up and hear what you are up to...might even have to steal some of your great ideas and use them in Freight. I'm here through Thursday.

Louise,

I understand from Michael Brown that you are my boss again (lucky you). I also understand that you have a ton of things on your plate but I have an issue that needs to be addressed and your help/clarification would be much appreciated.  

I am not sure whether we are going be shutting things down or going slow over near term but the guys in the states are canceling contracts with European clients that could lead to lawsuits and will severely harm the business.  

Less urgent is a deal that is in document/credit that we have put on the backburner, which could generate significant revenues this quarter (between $30 and $40 million in pv on an index deal).  I would like to discuss.


regards,
bruce

Louise, regarding our 2 external analysts in the Monterrey Office, which are now "Outside Contractors", and according to our previous conversation, I am sending you the numbers you asked for: 

Gabriela Cantu and Alejandra Reyes, both have a Bachelors Degree in Economics from the TEC in Monterrey (Equivalent to the US MIT), with post-graduate degree in Finance. Both work for us and help us elaborating the newsletters, doing Nat Gas Market research, and helping us quote derivatives to customers, and elaborate natural gas and fuel oil presentations. 

We did not hired them directly. We contracted an HR company, to which we pay a monthly charge in exchange for technical services performed by their personnel.  In principle, this scheme helped us find the right people since we could ask for a change in personel if we desired.  It also gave us other benefits like not having a head count increase at that time. We also have a signed confidentiality agreement with both of them. 

Today, we pay the HR company the following, per person, in US Dollar Equivalent per month: 

Services Invoice:		$1,660.00 
15% VAT Tax of the invoice:	   $250.00
Total Payment :			$1,910.00  

However, net income to each analyst per month is around $780.- USD per month. 

Gabirela Cantu has been helping us since January 2000, and Alejandra Reyes since December 2000. 

It is not a great expense, and they are of great help to our team. 

Best regards.

Thank you for your email I would think you should talk to Greg Piper as

Net Works, is also its COO.  Greg does currently have a lot of
opportunities in his group which may suit your skill set.

Louise -

First, congratulations on your resent position change. Sounds like an
exciting and challenging opportunity for you.

Second, you may have already heard but I just wanted to touch base with you
and give you an update on WaterDesk. American Water Works on Friday
notified
us that they have decided to pass on the acquisition of WaterDesk. This is
unfortunate for both the industry and WaterDesk as a whole. We are
immediately positioning WD to sell the individual assets as feasible and
have severed the team effective 3/16/01. Thank you for providing the names
of your Directors within Networks, the team has been in contact with the
various names you provided us. Alex and myself will be remaining to work
with various systems integrators and any other potential purchasers
interested in the "parts" of WaterDesk during the next several weeks.

And finally on a personal note, I was incredibly impressed with you and the
way you carried yourself during our meeting last month.  It was refreshing
to speak to someone as high energetic as you and to talk to someone who
really "get's it" at Enron. I'd be interested if you had any opportunities
and/or suggestions for an individual such as myself given my background in
developing and executing new business strategies for clients in the
consulting arena and most recently leading the WaterDesk from a product to
a
services focused company.

I look forward to any suggestions you may have. Regards, Karen Welsch.

Jaime,

I think it would be a good idea to wait until the end of the PRC process in a couple of weeks before discussing your contract.  This should ensure we get the right contract put before you.

Its only a couple of weeks.

I think it's in John's court.  Please advise as to whether it will be approved or needs to be changed.  It's been hanging out there for about a week.  Thanks.

All is under control:

a - We've set up a "Work-out" group under Cindy Skinner and will be producing the stats and making sure we don't cop out.
b - as above. Several have gone across wholesale already. stats will show this and progress on others.
c - Fair to say we have total clarity of direction here now! All memo's will be out by Monday, Cindy Olson has sent an email to HR community (re Embargo on HPL staff) and I believe Mark H is drafting something for other OTC's. Fran and Michele Cash (I also put another guy on this yesterday) have all in hand.

Crandall done
Badeer done
Swerzbin submitted comments on Monday;  feedback will be given to him today - some met some not;  Mike's comments on our feedback due on Monday;  should be in a position to execute next week.
Heizenrader is good on numbers and still talking language.  Final issues relate to language about breaking laws or regulations and all of the accusations that are out there about Enron and it's employees breaking laws and regulations.  Michele Cash has talked to Sanders and Haedicke about this stuff.  Tim H., Michele, Amy Fitzpatrick (HR Generalist in PDX) and I met today.  We think that we have arrived at language that will work for everyone.  Ball is in Michele's court to turn another draft around to us.
Belden - I am good on the numbers.  I have have concerns about indemnity against California and West Power related lawsuits.  I also want to formalize the arrangement that I have with Haedicke with respect to Enron covering my legal fees associated with the west power investigations.  Michele is going to take a cut at some language.  She also needs to convince me that I am covered by the Directors and Officers indemnifications which are part of Enron's bylaws and Delaware law.
Richter - he's been lame about giving me his comments.  I've been lame about riding him on it.  I will do that today.
Wolfe - Greg currently is considering offers from Calpine, AEP, and Enron.  AEP is offering significantly more money.  Greg needs to decide where he wants to work and who he wants to work with.  There is a very real chance that we lose him.  However, we've shown his a great bid, so we will just have to get by if he leaves for a lot of money.  When I say a lot, he is talking about guaranteed 600k per year, roughly.
Motley - has declined our offer.  The total numbers looked good, but he doesn't like Enron options.  If we took his Option value and put it into cash or restricted stock he would be done.  I mentioned it to John and he didn't want to do that.  On the one hand, if that will get him done I think that it's a great outcome.  On the other, we showed him some good numbers and I respect the fact that John wants to keep things consistent.  Tough call.  He did mention that if Enron's Treasury department would let him gamma trade his options withodd lots and no margin requirement that he would take the options.  He has a legitimate point that he has no way of assuring that he can achieve the value of the options.  It's also very hard to argue with an options trader on this point.

John/Diane,

I just spoke with Lavo. He believes group B should be:

Shively
Arnold
Belden
Presto
Allen
Benson
Calger
Davis (yes Dana M)
Milnthorp
Motley
Sturm
Swerzbin
Grigsby
Zufferli
Martin
Neal
Herndon
Maggi
Tycholiz

and should be 14 of 19 (ie we could swap out 5).

On group c, is this the other 75 or so key commercial and support employees
we talked about at the outset?

On retention contracts, can you send me example?

Please see attached spreadsheet.  

Some additional info about the spreadsheet:
was pulled from the system as of 8/15/01 and formated today.  
should reflect all promotions but will not show the EWS-EES groups or Enron South America. 
is seperated by job groups and sorted by total agreement value
employees who recieved agreements in our recent agreement efforts are highlighted in green
employees who are currently under executed agreement and also have drafts outstanding will show agreement values associated with the draft agreement only (not the current executed agreement)
employees who are currently under agreement with no draft outstanding will show agreement values still to be paid under the current contract (not the full value of the old contract)
the password is the same

 Please let me know if you would like formatting/content changes or have additional questions.

Do you still want me to call the names on the list, or shall we just send Billy a list of who we ideally would like?

Billy,

Several things I am hoping to go over with you Monday pm, but main thing is that ENA OTC is concerned that the names currently slated for the A&A PRC don't make sense.

Louise has asked me to call them and see if each are keen to do it, but main objection was the number of people from Power trading being distracted at their busiest time of the year. I told Louise that I was sure if we wanted to switch one or two around you wouldn't mind, however, I would confirm with you before suggesting alternates.

David

Louise and Marcus,

We're still in the waiting period with the green card process.

I confirmed that Louise can elect to participate in the domestic health plan. This will allow participation in the prescription drug program and a network option with co-payments, rather than turning in all receipts for reimbursement.  As we discussed, you do not want any changes until after the baby is born.  Let me know when you would like to get together to discuss the advantages/disadvantages of switching to the domestic plan.  

PwC sent over a draft of their deferred compensation scheme today.  I have forwarded to the compensation team for review and comment.

Try to send over a copy of Louise's new social security card this week.  Also, we would like to follow up on your unreimbursed medical claims.

Regards,

Energy Novice to Be Paid $240,000 
 Power: Hefty annual salary goes to consultant with one year's experience in the field. State officials say she is doing a good job. 


By JEFFREY L. RABIN, DARYL KELLEY, Times Staff Writers





     The Davis administration is paying a young business consultant with barely a year's experience in the energy industry $240,000 annually to head a team of traders who secure California's daily electricity supply. 
     State officials hired Susan T. Lee, 30, in April without competitive bidding under an emergency declaration by Gov. Gray Davis. 
     Lee's contract is equal to the $20,000 a month that Davis pays his chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman, a top utility executive for decades. 
     The two-year contract will pay Lee up to $480,000 to oversee the state's day-to-day energy purchases, totaling billions of dollars a year. 
     Lee's contract reflects the pressure and difficulties the state says it faces to fill key jobs in its new role as one of the nation's largest power buyers, a role that it took on in January as California's utilities faltered. 
     Lee's contract was one of about a dozen released Monday, and among the largest. 
     Reached at her Sacramento office, Lee would not discuss her contract. She said only that she heads a 15-person team of traders and schedulers that works long hours to keep California's power flowing. 
     Pete Garris, a contracts manager for the state Department of Water Resources who recruited Lee, said he met her at industry meetings and had been impressed by her savvy. 
     He said he gave her a pay raise to lure her to state service in April after Ron Shimizu, her boss at Mieco Inc., a trading firm in Long Beach, recommended her. Shimizu refused comment Tuesday. 
     The state, according to Garris, must compete for employees against an aggressive energy industry and pay good salaries to stay in the game. 
     "You can consider this situation to be very extraordinary," Garris said. "Unless we can get permanent and full-time positions approved, these are the rules we have to follow to be able to hire [consultants]." 
     Garris insisted that it is unfair to compare Lee's contract with the six-month, $120,000 deal that Freeman--the former boss at several major utilities--struck with the governor. 
     "I don't want to compare Susan Lee to David Freeman," Garris said. "David comes from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Susan came from a [private] power marketer. With Susan, we just followed the standard formula." 
     In her new job, Lee will direct an immensely complicated, around-the-clock operation responsible for "procuring energy, scheduling power and associated transmission, and reconciling deviations between contracts and deliveries," according to her contract. 
     Lee's resume, attached to the contract, shows that she had no experience in the energy field until March 2000, when she joined Mieco. There, she was a trader and power scheduler, not a manager. 
     "She was only here for a year or so," said Dina Alvarez, an administrative manager for the company. 
     A 1994 graduate of UCLA with a degree in economics, she worked as a pension and benefits manager in Los Angeles and New York before joining Mieco. 
     Lee's contract stands out compared to others disclosed this week, not only for its size but for her relative inexperience in the energy field. 
     She is being paid $120 an hour and can earn a maximum of $480,000, including expenses, by April 2003. 
     Another new consultant, William L. Green, has almost a quarter of a century of experience working for the Bonneville Power Administration, Pacific Gas & Electric and the California Independent System Operator. He is being paid $85 an hour to supervise workers who reconcile the state's accounting of energy purchases. His two-year deal is worth up to $340,000. 
     They are not alone in cutting lucrative deals. 
     Richard Ferreira, the former assistant general manager at the Sacramento Municipal Utilities District, has a $500,000 contract and is being paid $200 an hour to assist the state in negotiating power purchase contracts. He worked for the Department of Water Resources for 23 years before joining the Sacramento agency in 1987. 
     Hardy Energy Consulting also has a $150,000, six-month contract that calls for Randy Harvey to be paid $300 an hour. Harvey has a quarter of a century of energy experience, particularly at the Bonneville Power Administration, where he was chief executive officer from 1991 to 1997. 
     Lee's recruiter, Garris, said her lack of experience is not a concern. 
     "So far she's done an excellent job," he said. "She has the skills, and she has the ability. She was doing a similar job." 
     Dozens of consultants, including Lee, have been hired since January, when Davis declared an energy emergency and set up a special arm of government to buy power. 
     The state filled a vacuum when generators refused to sell to PG&E, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric because they were no longer considered credit-worthy, said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the Department of Water Resources. 
     Hidalgo said that about 60% of the 95 people now working for the division are consultants. The rest are state employees. 
     As part of the process, Lee's unit oversees the purchase of power a day ahead of when it is needed. Hidalgo said Lee is involved in contracts that extend no more than three months.

Attached is an organizational statistics summary for the first half of 2001.  The HR organization has been working to develop meaningful reporting of trends in our employee population.  A few highlights from this report:

The employee base continues to grow (though on a significantly slower pace than 2000).
Terminations (voluntary and involuntary) are up dramatically this year.
Our "contribution loss" (a statistic which uses terminations weighted by the performance ratings of those leaving) has gone up, indicating that we are losing more high performers than in previous periods.  However, those departures of high performers are concentrated in areas of substantial reorganizations (EBS, the former EE&CC and HPL).
Let us know if you would like to see additional items on the report or if you have questions about the data.

        Upon review of the Chicago business, balancing the need for continu=
ity on behalf of Peoples Energy and ensuring the ability for Hunter and I t=
o manage the Chicago joint venture (enovate) and the ENA/Peoples utility tr=
ansaction from Houston, it is our recommendation to place Richard Tomaski a=
nd Gregg Penman under contract with Enron.

Gregg holds responsibility for all office management, customer origination =
and reporting to Enron/Peoples.  In my absence he serves as my eyes and ear=
s to the overall business.  While I have been in Houston we speak daily reg=
arding all management of the business including, but not limited to contrac=
ting with over 40 counterparties, long term origination including Allegheny=
 and Constellation, control of enovate credit policy, control of enovate ri=
sk management policy (with Frank Hayden) and overall office management.  Gr=
egg receives high marks from Enron legal, credit, risk management, and fina=
nce as a tremendous resource and from Peoples Sr. Management.  I believe En=
ron many times overlooks the importance of account management and Gregg is =
a classic example of an employee who balances the needs of the customer wit=
h keeping Enron's interests foremost.  I am confident Gregg is key to ensur=
ing the transaction with Peoples is renewed in 3 years.

Richard holds responsibility for the daily business of enovate.  He is prov=
en in his ability to hold the trust of Peoples Gas/North Shore providing an=
 array of "no-risk" value for Enron and enovate.  Richard serves as the inf=
ormation conduit to the Central desk and Enron Houston.  Richard is excelle=
nt at balancing his role to Enron and the complete trust that Peoples has p=
laced in him.  Richard is a rare find and perfect fit in a joint venture be=
cause of his tenure at Enron involving stints in economics, risk management=
, structuring and trading.  Richard is the key reason we have kept a balanc=
e of trust with the utilities of Peoples.  Richard has been engaged with th=
is customer for 3 years and the trust/knowledge Peoples bestows to Richard =
is directly related to this history, Richard's hard work and inherent custo=
mer skills.    A departure by Richard would provide a very difficult issue =
for Hunter and I due to the balanced approach Richard exemplifies.  Richard=
 is Hunter's on sight control of the enovate business.

If you would like to discuss this further, please contact me at 713/853-385=
5.  I recommend we proceed immediately and prior to my full-time departure =
from Chicago scheduled for August.

Louise,

I can't tell you how excited I am to do it.  I also get the great pleasure of saying who I am working on it for along with working for you at work. 
It is taking a long time, as we bought a travel trailer and have been working on getting it ready for the deer lease.  I've decided (like that authority) when its finally complete that's when we'll have y'all over for dinner and present it to you then.  Tell me who your framer is, as I will have more items to frame down the road.

P. S. I showed you my son's Christmas stocking it took me a year to complete it and I was traveling a lot and used many flights as stitching time.

Thanks again for being #17!  I am very excited for you.

Best Regards,
Bobbi

Louise,

Birth registry with The Vital Statistics and Records office (the office who issues certified original birth certificates) will not have record of Scott's birth for approximately eight weeks.  We need this document to obtain the UK birth registry and passport.

If you have plans to travel soon/before the birth certificate is available, we can appear in person, with tickets (travel itineraries are not acceptable), information provided by the hospital and obtain it by 4:00pm the day following the application.  I will also need the two items listed in the next paragraph as well.

If you have no immediate travel plans, I have calendared the seventh week (after Scott's birth) to obtain documentation from you, a letter with your signature stating I can receive it on your behalf and a copy of your drivers license.  I will then confirm his birth has been registered and apply on your behalf.

Best Regards,
      Bobbi

Many exciting things have happened since I last emailed you about the Program.  Today, I will highlight the results of the recent Program Survey and discuss several initiatives we have underway.  I also want to invite each of you to attend one of four meetings we've scheduled to discuss the information below in greater detail, and to provide you with an opportunity for Q&A.

Program Survey
I want thank everyone who participated in the Program Survey a few weeks ago.  As promised,  I also want to communicate the results of the feedback you provided.  In short, we've made progress over the past 5 months in a number of areas, but there are still things that we can improve on.  Below are some summary points about the Survey, and how the results compare to the last Program Survey in October 2000.

We surveyed all members of the Western Hemisphere Program, business unit supervisors and PRC reps, and summer interns. 
Response rates of about 40% were consistent with last year.
When asked about Overall Satisfaction with the Program, "Favorable" responses from Associates improved to 58% from 27%, and from Analysts improved to 46% from 41%.  "Unfavorable" responses also improved for both groups (Associates to 8% from 41% last year, and Analysts to 13% from 29%).
Similar improvements were noted in the responses from the Business Units.  When asked about Overall Satisfaction with the Program, "Favorable" responses improved to 69% from 49%, and "Unfavorable" responses improved to 3% from 24%.
Areas for Improvement most frequently mentioned included Rotation Management, Compensation, Performance Review Process, and Communication.  We have activities in progress to continue improvement in each of these areas.

Initiatives  
Below are some highlights of several things that will "roll-out" over the next few weeks, and many of them reflect your input to the Program through Survey feedback, as well as meetings that I've had with many of you.

A new, online Rotation Information and Management System is in development and should be ready for delivery during the 4th quarter.
Compensation packages have been revised for the current recruiting season.  An equity adjustment for current members of the Program is set for February 2002, several months ahead of the new class start dates.  
We made significant changes to the PRC process at mid-year.  At this time we are working with HR on further improvements which will be implemented for the year-end process. 
On the communication front several things are happening.  The Associate / Analyst Program newsletter will return later this month.  The format will be a concise email similar to the EnTouch newsletter used by Wholesale, and Global Flash in Europe.  A new external website for the Program was launched last week (access it via www.enron.com <http://www.enron.com>).  A new internal website is expected to be operational by the end of September.  We are also planning eSpeak and Brown Bag sessions this fall to talk in greater detail about things like Recruiting, the PRC Process, and other topics of interest.  We will also continue the pizza lunch schedule.
An updated social and community service activity schedule has been completed, and we are working on a more integrated approach to training and development for the Program. 

Program Meetings
I invite each of you to select and attend one of the meetings listed below, where I will discuss in greater detail the information I've highlighted above.  Each meeting will be held in EB 5C2, and will run from 7:30 to 8:30 am.  A continental breakfast will be provided.  Because space in this room is limited, pls rsvp to my assistant Maxine Levingston by the dates listed below.  Maxine can be reached by email at Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com <mailto:Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com>.

Friday, Sept 21   7:30-8:30 am   EB 5C2    (rsvp no later than 12:00 noon, Thursday Sept 20)
Tuesday, Sept 25   7:30-8:30 am   EB 5C2   (rsvp no later than 12:00 noon, Monday Sept 24)
Wednesday, Sept 26   7:30-8:30 am   EB 5C2   (rsvp no later than 12:00 noon, Tuesday Sept 25)
Tuesday, Oct. 9     7:30-8:30 am EB 5C2 (rsvp no later than 12:00 noon, Monday, Oct. 8)

I look forward to seeing each of you over the next few weeks.

Best regards,
Billy Lemmons
Vice President, Associate / Analyst Program

I told Jean that she could pay Bilbury 50K and nonthing else.  I told her that I completely disagree with any payment so view it as a payment to her or for her to be happy.  This upset her.  She wanted to give him 25k later and I vetoed that.  Is that how you spell vetoed.

Subject:	Bridgeline

Louise:

I spoke to Texaco today and put forth the following alternatives:  (1) remove Randy and put Jean in his place (I did offer to consider paying Randy out of his contract), (2) transfer all Texaco/Enron employees to Bridgeline without the ability for them to get paid out and walk away when the Texaco/Chevron merger occurs.  

Texaco strongly....no violently....opposes installing Jean as President, as they feel that everyone would quit - and no doubt many would.  My counter was that many of these people may quit anyway once the Texaco merger occurs, so we are in the same spot but with a President that is committed to the company.  My personal feeling is that we would also loose a number of the Enron folks, but we could recover, and may be better off.

I'm not sure we have a legal case to force Randy out, especially given Texaco's violent opposition.  However,  the threat of Jean as President seems to have a good deal of motivational power.  Jack Abadie committed to propose the following to Texaco in his meeting in NYC next week:

1.	All employees become Bridgeline employees now.
2.	Texaco employees get paid by Texaco their severance as follows:  (half when the merger occurs, the remainder after 12 - 24 months.
3.	If Texaco employees leave they loose the unpaid severance.

I am going to develop our legal position to see what leverage we have (or don't have).  I do have the "open cost issues" as a bargaining chip, but would like to drive this to a crisis point before playing that card.

I have a bet with Texaco that I can have the Bridgeline benefits plan in place by the end of the month.  Jeannie Slone is committed to this goal.
Also, I have not yet relayed the Texaco conversation with Jean and would like to hold off to see how this plays out.

Regards,
Brian

We're looking at this as we speak, along with the PRC.  Don't want to repeat the nightmare.

I want to put as much discretion as possible in the hands of the business units.  The "strawman" we're looking at would have a very basic matrix, with a discretionary business unit component (that really gives the OTC's the freedom to do what they want).  

I think we need the basic matrix to avoid EEOC problems, and to not drive a/a's toward wanting to work in just one part of the organization.

Subject:	Budget and A&A allocations

So here's my question.  Is there any possibility that we will be not doing the standard bonusses (which have caused huge problems in the US in the last years) at the end of this or next year.

I need to know whether to budget the bonus numbers/aa allocations for 2002.

If you haven't thought of this please do as I really do not think its appropriate to go with the nightmare from last year.

It might be quicker to just take the number from the DPR and split it out into a number by originator, as we do need the information for Monday's prc.  The numbers below are the total per region which need dividing up by originator.

Frank		$8,261,000
Enovate	$6,219,000
Laura		$2,357,000
Fred		$19,465,000

Please send back the divided numbers to both Faith and I.

Thanks

Louise

Hi Louise,

As requested, attached is a file that contains June YTD Originations by Originator.

We've arranged the file in the following sorts:

?	by team
?	by Originator (sorted alphabetically)
?	by Originator (sorted by value)
?	Top 10 Overall Originators by Value
?	Top 10 Originators- Gas
?	Top 10 Originators- Power

An item to note is that not all deals had a related individual's name (such as Enduser)- we left the listing as it appears in the Risk Book in these cases.

We'll send you an update if the DPR amounts move (the DPR isn't final yet.)

Please let me know if you need any additional information!

Hi Louise,

Congratulations on your baby and welcome back.  

I'm preparing the agenda for Enron's annual management conference again this year.  I was hoping I could ask for your insight as I'm compiling the program.

This year's conference theme plays off of our new vision, "Becoming the World's Leading Company."  However, the feeling at Enron is quite different this year because of the depressed stock price, California, India, Broadband, etc.  I'd welcome your thoughts on what the tone for the conference should be, i.e. subdued optimism, reenergizing, etc.

On a related subject, Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling will both have an hour on the agenda to speak.  This is in response to feedback from employees saying they want to hear more from each of them.  Afterall, they are both top notch industry speakers.  Rather than have them give a current "state of the company" address, I intend to have them focus on bigger company, industry or market topics.  I'd love your thoughts on this as well.  (I believe Jeff needs to lay out a plan for achieving our vision, and as an economist, Ken could give valuable insight into what's happening in the market.)

Finally, I'd welcome any ideas for an outside corporate speaker.  I'd very much like to have someone from a corporation that 1.) Enron people admire; and 2.) has undergone some difficult period in their company's history.  Jeff personally extended an invitation to Steve Ballmer from Microsoft, but he is unable to attend.  Is there someone you think would be interesting?

I truly appreciate any consideration you can give this issue.  I look forward to your thoughts and ideas.

It has come to our attention that confidential information was disclosed after the EWS PRC meeting this past Tuesday.  We are very concerned about any breach of confidentiality as it relates to discussions in our PRC meetings.

The PRC process is very important at Enron, and it is absolutely critical that confidentiality is maintained throughout the process.  It goes without saying that information discussed during a PRC meeting should never be shared outside the meeting.  The integrity of the entire PRC process is at risk if we cannot trust what is said in the room during a meeting will stay in the room.

The mid-year PRC process is still ongoing and many of you will be attending final Enron-wide meetings later this month.  The process is not complete until these final meetings are concluded, at which time individual feedback should be given.  That feedback should be summary information only specific to the individual.  Information should never be shared about others' ratings or specific comments made about a person.

Please see either one of us if you wish to discuss this further.

Mark Frevert and Greg Whalley

I will just be putting the date on to reflect when you will be going on maternity leave.  Do you have a date in mind yet?  From your point of view nothing will change.

I don't know if you have an equivalent form to the UK's Mat B1 which states your due date from your doctor?  If so could you forward that to me.

I attach the letter as it will be a lot quicker than post.

 

Thanks
Kate

Louise,

David Knox let me know you are pregnant and I hope everything is going well?  I deal with all maternity for people on London payroll.  Can you let me know when your due date is so I can get the HR system and payroll correct.

I will then send you the relevant paperwork.  Any questions then please call me.

Thanks
Kate

After several very difficult weeks, Enron announced on Friday that the company has reached an agreement to merge with Dynegy.  

I know that everyone has many questions right now regarding the future of the Associate / Analyst Program.  We are working as quickly as possible with the business units and executive management to determine the future course of the Program.  As the merger points on the Enron homepage indicate (<http://home.enron.com/>), Dynegy has a similar program called "PACE", and the two companies will consider a combination of the two programs.  

Today, all of the business units within Enron will be holding floor meetings to discuss the pending merger and it's implications for Enron.  I encourage each of you to participate in one of these meetings.  

The announcement of the deal with Dynegy marks a significant event in removing some of the uncertainties we've all dealt with over the past several weeks.  As decisions are made regarding the future of the company and specific business units, we will be able to determine and communicate the future of the Program.

New opportunities will be created from the changes that are occurring.  The very best talent from both organizations will rise to the top, and our Associates and Analysts will be a key part of our future success.

I appreciate your continued efforts and patience during this difficult time.

Billy Lemmons
Vice President,  Associate / Analyst Program

Hi Louise,

As requested, attached is a file that contains June YTD Originations by Originator.

We've arranged the file in the following sorts:

?	by team
?	by Originator (sorted alphabetically)
?	by Originator (sorted by value)
?	Top 10 Overall Originators by Value
?	Top 10 Originators- Gas
?	Top 10 Originators- Power

An item to note is that not all deals had a related individual's name (such as Enduser)- we left the listing as it appears in the Risk Book in these cases.

We'll send you an update if the DPR amounts move (the DPR isn't final yet.)

Please let me know if you need any additional information!

Rob, I have already spoke with Paul and told him of the opportunities we have in Toronto.  He seemed very interested and it was left in his camp to contact me after thinking through his options (Calgary and staying in the UK).  Louise, you sent the E-mail to Derek Davies. Does Paul want a follow up from Derek as to Alberta options??

I will call him today to touch base anyway, but if possible please clarify....

Cheers, Paul D

Paul Goddard is a manager in the London office looking to come home to Canada (Calgary or Toronto) and has spoken to Paul in Toronto.  Paul is a strong manager who has been in the organisation for several years.  I know that Paul has a position offer in Dynegy (from Pope obviously).  I think that it would be good for you to have a chat with him to see if there is a fit as I wouldn't want to lose him.  At the moment, he seems very keen on Toronto and working in power retail - he definitely doesn't want to leave Enron.

His number is +44 7748 932298

Thanks

Louise

Fred called yesterday to let me know he was going to move Lisa Hesse in to replace Judy Thorn on the Well-head Desk. 

 Lisa is a Sr. Spec currently making 48.5K. She was not ranked at mid-yr but was ranked Strong at yr-end.  She is on reduced hours which Fred believes works well for the position.  

Just want to confirm that you are ok with this move to be effective Nov. 5.  Thanks

Louise, sorry I missed you today.  I just wanted to get your ideas for the upcoming performance review meetings for the East Power Team.  My understanding is that John Lavorato may be begining to think about how to approach the midyear process and I wanted to get your thoughts as well.  Would you like to reschedule a time to discuss?

All,

The below Analyst & Associate recruiting dates require ENA participation at Manager level at above.   In order to resource each of your departments it is important to have ENA's involvement and participation in the interviews and debrief sessions on Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday events.     These de-brief sessions will allow you the opportunity to select candidates you wish to join your groups.  The target  is to assign potential candidates to business units and departments from the outset.

As ENA has the highest percentage of A&A rotating in its business unit, the participation of ENA at interview should reflect this.     Therefore, please encourage your direct reports and managers to participate in the below events in order to secure candidates for your business area.


Associate Recruiting:		Saturday November 3						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview
Analyst Recruiting:		Friday, November 16						Total - 70 Candidates for Interivew
Associate Recruiting:		Saturday, December 1						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview

The above spreadsheet represents ENA's particpation today which I believe highlights the need for much additional support in these efforts.

Please confirm by return participation of your respective groups.

Regards,

Karen Buckley
HR - ENA

Louise,

I spun things around a bit, but honestly I am comfortable with either version.  Should this go to Detmering as well?


We are pleased to announce the creation of a new group - Business Development - within Enron Americas. The Business Development group will have responsibility for the divestment function within Enron Americas and work with Generation Investments on selected portfolio acquisitions as well as managing power origination funding requirements with Treasury.   

Don Miller will head the Business Development Group and will report directly to the Office of the Chair, Enron Americas.

Please join us in congratulating Don on his new role.

You should have recently received an e-mail from Amy Fitzpatrick with proposed contract numbers for most of the people in my group.  I have met with each person on my staff to discuss ballpark numbers.  I don't have definitive offers from anyone, nor have I shown them definitive bids.  However, I have asked each person to provide me with a ballpark value that they would be willing to do.  On an encouraging note, the ballpark values were in line with what we ultimately offered Crandall.  However, these values are significantly above the "standard proposal" put forth earlier.  I would very much like to get these guys done without forcing them into the painful shopping process.  I think these numbers get us there and are consistent with what I believe to be "market" for west power traders, as is evidenced by Sean Crandall.

I would like to set up a meeting to discuss ASAP.  Perhaps David should figure out a time for us to get together to talk through the spreadsheet.

For who? Portland? 

There were none for big kids, but may have been 2/3 of the specilist/ A&A's over there who got them for the last time..

Only other one I was aware of was Laura Luce in Chicago which I think may have had something for state tax.

I'll check.

Mike and I both negotiated contracts with Jim Fallon that originally started in September of 1999 that were to end in September of 2001.  These original contracts were signed, I believe, in October or November of 1999.  They were both done under Enron Corp.  Then, in the beginning of 2000, the contracts were redrafted and done under ENA and extended through the end of 2001.  I think that you are missing the original doc that was done in 1999 that had a signing bonus.  If you look at Sept 99 to Sep of 01 Mike was paid 434 in year 1 and 3?? in year 2.  I have asked Mike to bring in the original doc from 1999 that had the signing bonus.  Perhaps HR might have a copy as well.

	Kim,
	I am enclosing the mid year evaluation of the two people that support me in our Mexico City Office.
	It is my understanding that the rating is 1,2 or 3. One being the highest ranking.

	MARIA ELENA MENDOZA	Rating  1

She is the executive assistant of the Office of the Chairman at "Enron de Mexico", and maintains the permanent
relationships with the Executive offices of most of our clients, and Government officials ( a network of contacts that
she has developed over the last 10 years). Through this, she provides tremendous support in the organization 
of complex agendas. 
In this capacity, she helps me coordinate the meetings of an important Business Group, which I chair, that includes 
the largest 50 Foreign Corporations in Mexico, 
She also provides support to most Enron executives that visit Mexico City, and coordinates their appointments.
Additionally, she serves as the administrative liaison between our Mexico City and Monterrey office, being responsible
for payments and maintenance of our installations.
As a whole, she is a very important asset to Enron's presence in Mexico.


	ANASTASIO MARTINEZ ZAPATA	Rating   1

He serves as clerk, office support, messenger and chuffer to Enron de Mexico, Mexico City office.
He is extremely loyal, and is always available to our office needs, working nights and weekends, whenever needed.
He provides support to different Enron employees that travel to Mexico City from Houston or Monterrey,  by driving them around
making sure that they are secure throughout their stay in Mexico.
Additionally he takes care of many maintenance related items in our office.  
He is also a very valuable asset to our operation in Mexico City.


	I hope this is the type of report that it is required. Regards,	jaime____

Seems to me a sensible move quickly on Steve Irvine and Jaime Williams to get contracts in place following Yzaguirre's departure. I believe Jaime's contract has just expired and Irvine we drafted back in April as part of the blitz approach but never got past the "do Yzaguirre first" obstacle.

What do you think? You want to talk with them or should we go direct to them?

Guys--

First of all, Louise, I understand we have a baby??  CONGRATULATIONS!! (details please, at your earliest chance)

Regarding the Wharton e-Business Initiative (see below for one of the many eMails I've received concerning Enron's participation--link to the referenced web site for specific agenda; also, I've received several voice messages from leaders of the effort).  The information below discusses one of the  forums (coming up 5/31-6/1) that comprise an on-going e-business initiative in which Enron has invested with Wharton.

 The participants from Wharton include senior level professors; while there may be some student involvement, the intentional focus is high level discussion and research endeavors at the professorial level.  
Other participants in WeBI are Corporate representatives.  The idea is for the professors to offer their latest research issues, promote discussions among the corporate participants to talk through the professors research and other research in the literature, as well as for the professors to listen for new areas for which commercial eBusinesses are seeking new research.

Again,  this is intentionally designed as a High Level Professor participation on the Wharton side, and high level e-Business Corporate executives on the other side. This is intentionally designed to create a high-level 'e-think-tank' environment for senior level professors and corporate executives.

O.K.....have I labored enough to describe what WeBI is all about??

As opposed to the several other efforts Enron University Affairs has to DIRECTLY increase Enron's favorability and familiarity on campus at levels above recruiting, but that ultimately trickle down to recruiting, this is intentionally a research/discussion effort. Clearly, the Enron Brand equity in dealing with professors is that the professors ultimately incorporate work from information from the participatory forums into their class teachings, references, course work, etc. 

A few weeks ago, Louise and I breifly chatted about Enron's involvement in this effort.  Clearly, there is a HUGE interest by the Wharton professors and other corporate participants involved to have Enron attend and participate---they quite respectfully call me and eMail me very frequently.......All of this is very interesting to me and I have shepherded our minimal involvement-in-fact........ yet the question remains:  is there someone at Enron, directly involved in Enron's eBusiness initiatives, interested in jumping into this effort and participating?  Do those of you involved in these businesses think it worth your time and expense, or the time and expense of one of your senior (at least Director level) people to participate?  Would it be viewed, at least at this time,  simply as an "Enron brain drain" (I've received this realistic and possibly quite legitimate concern from more than one business person at Enron).   

The bottom line is, I'd like to be able to respond intelligently and honestly to those at Wharton committed to this effort.  I feel more than comfortable telling Wharton that, at this time, Enron is satisfied to participate in the WeBI effort largely at the 
financial level it has already invested--with the option to participate at other levels in the future, at Enron's discretion.

ALL comments solicited----

Many thanks!!

--Christie.

Christie,

Lee Goldring, our new Forum director mentioned that he placed a call to you
to introduce himself and follow up on Enron's representation at the next
meeting.  I'm emailing this information to you to alert you to the situation
since I do not think you would want Enron to go unrepresented at the next
meeting. To date, no one from Enron has registered for the Forum sponsored
Online Conversion Workshop,  the Forum meeting on 5/31 or the Members Only
meeting on 6/1.  Please note that the "From Browsers to Buyers: Online
Conversion Workshop" on May 30th is purely optional in case some folks from
Enron are interested in attending.  Since the Forum is co-sponsoring the
Workshop -- WeBI affiliated registrants will not be charged the $495
registration fee as an added benefit for their sponsorship.

Here are all the relevent links to the Forum agenda and registration sites
for your convenience:

Louise,

I understand from Michael Brown that you are my boss again (lucky you). I also understand that you have a ton of things on your plate but I have an issue that needs to be addressed and your help/clarification would be much appreciated.  

I am not sure whether we are going be shutting things down or going slow over near term but the guys in the states are canceling contracts with European clients that could lead to lawsuits and will severely harm the business.  

Less urgent is a deal that is in document/credit that we have put on the backburner, which could generate significant revenues this quarter (between $30 and $40 million in pv on an index deal).  I would like to discuss.


regards,
bruce

Nothing seems to be recorded re the alledged $3.5m in options. Kari and I believe it could be the old ECT LTCP projected value which would be entirely separate from his contract, however we will dig some more. If he has documentation/emails, love to see them.

On Wednesday we will be having a mini Trading Track interview session.  The quality may not resemble the first session we had but I thought it would be worth it if we can find a couple more folks to put in the program.  We will probably have a much bigger one later in the year after the new analysts and associates join.  I had a couple of observations from last time.

1.  I think we were too hard on external candidates.  There are 5 or 6 external candidates.  Remember that they don't have the Enron grounding that the internal candidates have.  Most of them are not in the Gas or Electricity industry.  Try to evaluate them on their intrinsic qualities.

2.  Some people have not thought about trading concepts and are unfamiliar with trading lingo.  That doesn't mean that they will not be good traders one day. I think we were a little biased based on someones ability to run a stack tommorrow.  

Regards

John

Do you remember Steve Vavrik?  Wants to move back to the East Coast.  Can you offer him anything in that region.  Remember he has a power plant background.  Perhaps with Rahil's fuel cell opp, or at Brooklyn Navy Yards?

Thought that culture management meeting was actually quite useful.  The "Ken & Jeff" pres is woeful, so we need to keep working our bit so there's something interesting to say.

Steve's resigned, going back to Boston where his wife has a job.  I said I'd see whether NA can use him or EES, (he's not keen to leave the company).  I also asked him to talk to Chris McKey re metals in New York.  (Chris, perhaps you could give him a call if he doesn't).

He is likely to end up at Calpine, Intergen or Dynegy if we can't place him.

Perhaps we need to look at our Managers and Directors again. Independently =
of below it seems appropriate to review key personnel comp following mid ye=
ar PRC. What do you think.

FYI we have most Managers at $90k and Directors at $115.

You beat me to the punch.  I spoke to Suresh Vasan who briefly worked Enrico and he suggested that I call Marcello.  

Thank you for the feedback.

So the scoop is He is Average.

He recently moved out of Bandwidth 6 weeks ago and back into Continental Power trading - why he is moving again after 6 weeks.  Is it a problem with the business or him?

He worked for Marcello Romano (Head of Bandwidth Trading in Europe) as John knows.  Marcello says he is a solid hard worker who has no edge.  If Marcello were to run UK Gas again he wouldn't take him - as he is not sharp.  So he wouldn't bother to move him across the Atlantic if it costs a lot.

Your call.  Ring Marcello for more information.

I regret to announce that Sean Crandall has tendered his resignation from Enron.  He has decided to return to his native land of Utah to join Duke Energy's trading team.  Sean made tremendous contributions to our trading floor during the past few years.  He will be sorely missed.  Please join me in wishing Sean the best in his future endeavors.

Thanks - Eric mentioned that Dynegy had been pursuing him.  We did however sign up Eric on a 
three year agreement last week.  Too bad about Jonathon but given his back to back
experiences in Japan and LNG it was probably a good move on his part.

Heads Up, I spoke to Jonathon this evening.  I confirmed that Dynegy had been speaking to Eric Shaw at length.  I think the only reason Jonathan got the job was that he asked for less money.

Happy New Year all,

I have been with Enron for over 16 years and I have made some very good fri=
ends during my time here and right now I am feeling their pain and panic.  =
I talk to several of my terminated friends (and sister) each week and get u=
pdates from them on what is going on outside of Enron.  I just want to do w=
hatever I can to help them get through these hard times, this is the reason=
 for my weekly reminders to you all who have the power to do something for =
them.

I passed on the phone numbers for Towers Perrin and other numbers that they=
 need to get their money from the Cash Balance Plan or to find out more abo=
ut the COBRA benefits, etc. but there is a major stumbling block in their w=
ay right now.  They keep being told that no one can do anything for them, n=
ot even send them the necessary forms to get the ball rolling on these bene=
fits, because Enron has not changed their status from active to terminated =
(or inactive).  How can it possibly take a month to get this status changed=
?  Please realize that a lot of these people have nothing:  no paycheck com=
ing in, no unemployment checks YET, no retirement, no cash balance money, n=
o medical benefits....they are feeling scared and panicked....PLEASE lets d=
o something to help them.  I have no clue what all it takes to get 4,500+ e=
mployees status changed but surely it cannot take a month to accomplish thi=
s.  Whomever is in charge of getting this done, are we sure they have a sen=
se of urgency about the situation?  People could lose their homes, cars, et=
c. while they are waiting on all this red tape....this is very important.

Please advise.

Sabra Dinari

I want to take a moment to thank each of you for having a summer Analyst or Associate work on your team. I also want to remind everyone what a high stakes activity this is for Enron.
Based on your recommendation, we will make offers at the end of the summer to those interns who perform, and who you endorse as a potential future member of your team. Those interns who have had a good experience and accept our offer will be the lowest risk hires we make - from any source. We will have effectively interviewed and watched them work for 2-3 months. They also have the potential to be the most effective advocates and talent scouts we have, when they return to campus. On the flip side, those who don't have meaningful assignments, or have bad experiences during the summer can severely hurt our efforts.
Thank you again for being part of this very important activity. If you have any questions, or if areas of concern arise during the summer, please contact Ted Bland (x35275), Traci Warner (x33242) or me (x36671).
We appreciate your contributions to this important effort for Enron. 
Billy

Louise:

I have revised what I sent you earlier per our discussions on Friday and have already started working with Tom Martin on Texas Gas Orig.  Please let me know when you have spoken with Jean about my assuming P/L responsibility for Bridgeline and I will get started on that activity.

Regards,
Brian

Louise:

I have attached two "job descriptions" based on my conversations with Dave, John, Tom M. and you.  The first focuses on power/gas origination in Texas/Mexico as a seperate region,  the second focuses on power asset development business in North America.

I know John sees a need to focus on re-establishing our position in the Texas gas maket.  If we combine the ERCOT/Mexico power origination with Texas and Mexico gas, then this will build on my power skills, knowledge of the Texas gas market, and my non-US market experience.

Dave is on board with me heading up the power development activities and probably would be more on board with me focusing on ERCOT as this would be less disruptive to his business.  

I am open to either - we can chat tomorrow.

Brian

Louise,  I spoke with Max Yzaguirre yesterday who told me that you had a conversation with him about handling the mexico performance management process in your absence.  Is that the case or do you want to remain the supervisor in PEP for Jamie Alatorre?  Can you please advise so I may correct the information in PEP. Thanks a million!  Hope you and the new baby are doing well.

Hi Greg, 

Just to make sure we are on the same page. Here is what we came up with finally

I will report to you and stay on at least till the end of this year. In the meantime we will work on getting some more people trained in the operations area. Brad will assume Andy's role at EnronOnline by the end of this year. Brad and I will work with the traders to prioritize functionality requests. At the end of the year I will have to option to move on to do something different.

All this will be effective Tuesday since Jay wants to wait for Mark Pickering to return. Finally this has Louise, John and your support.

Louise:

I got a couple urgent messages today from Jody Pierce and Fred Mitro asking about allocation of the group's origination.

Attached please find our official list (a copy of which I gave you last week, but I have made a few updates).

In making these allocations for purposes of the PRC process, however, I want to note a couple of things. First, I have listed the individual in the group who worked most with me on each of the subject transactions. Each deal, however, involved many members of the group, and I don't want to diminish other's contributions to these deals. The deals we have closed have been very complicated, and have all involved many months of structuring in order to bring them to the point of creating value for the Company.

Second, the deal sheet does not recognize the significant development milestones we have reached with respect to Florida and Georgia in particular.

Lastly, you will note that I have left my name off the list. I have done this for two reasons: because I have worked on all these deals, and because I want to motivate people in the group by providing them recognition for their efforts. The specific contribution made by the individuals on this list varies by the skill set of these individuals. Some co-leads have played a more technical role, while others have played more of a commercial role. 

I will be prepared to go through this list in detail on Monday, and provide a more comprehensive explanation of the listed individual's contributions. I will also be prepared to talk about the contributions to our development efforts that others have made.

Please let me know if you'd like to talk about this list this weekend. You can page me at 1-888-876-3206.

Regards,

Ben

Enron's Skilling Cites Stock-Price Plunge As Main Reason for Leaving CEO Po=
st By John R. Emshwiller  08/16/2001  The Wall Street Journal  Page A2  (Co=
pyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  Jeffrey K. Skilling said that=
 the pressure he felt from Enron Corp.'s plummeting stock price was the mai=
n reason he decided to resign Tuesday as the energy giant's chief executive=
 officer after only about six months in the job.  In an interview yesterday=
, the 47-year-old Mr. Skilling elaborated on his decision to leave Houston-=
based Enron. On Tuesday, Mr. Skilling insisted he had resigned for "persona=
l reasons" unrelated to Enron's business activities.  In the interview, he =
reiterated that he wasn't under any pressure to resign from the company's b=
oard or Chairman Kenneth Lay, who has resumed the CEO's duties at the natio=
n's biggest energy trader.  However, yesterday Mr. Skilling said that his "=
personal reasons" were deeply enmeshed with feelings that he had failed in =
a crucial business area during his brief tenure as CEO. Calling the company=
's stock performance a "kind of ultimate score card," Mr. Skilling noted th=
at Enron's share price had fallen by some 50% this year.  Mr. Skilling said=
 he took that stock-price drop very personally. "I put a lot of pressure on=
 myself" for that decline, he said. "I felt I must not be communicating wel=
l enough" with investors. He felt this particularly given Enron's strong fi=
nancial results over the past several quarters, based largely on growing vo=
lumes in its trading business, which covers a range of items, including ele=
ctricity, pulp and paper.  If the stock price had remained up "I don't thin=
k I would have felt the pressure to leave," he said.  In January, Enron top=
ped $84 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. It closed Tue=
sday, before the announcement of Mr. Skilling's resignation, at $42.93 a sh=
are. As of 4 p.m. yesterday, Enron traded at $40.25, after falling below $3=
7 during the day.  Mr. Skilling, who had been at Enron 11 years, said the d=
epressed stock price was particularly tough to explain to fellow Enron empl=
oyees, many of whom are shareholders. "People would say `What is going on w=
ith the stock, Jeff?' I would have to say I didn't know. It has been frustr=
ating," said Mr. Skilling.  The self-portrait offered by Mr. Skilling in th=
e interview is rather different from the widely held image of him as an amb=
itious, bright and thick-skinned business strategist whose long-held goal h=
ad been becoming Enron CEO. Mr. Skilling said that the "final straw" in his=
 decision to leave had come on a visit last week to England in connection w=

If this has not been done - I would like to know who is requesting Phillip is retained.  I spoke to John who was not aware of the issues - he does feel that this tax year is out of the question.  But going forward this should be an issue - John was also unaware of the advice I had been given which is clearly incorrect.

Why did I receive no response to this email should the action I requested not have been implemented.

Subject:	Philip Hawkins at PWC

 I have recently had some very bad experiences with Philip's advice and suggest that he is removed from Enron's account completely.  Obviously David has had him removed from working on anything this side of the Atlantic.

I feel strongly that Enron employees should not be exposed to the potential liabilities which could be incurred through incorrect advice and would suggest your side of the water remove him also in the interests of Enron as a whole.

If you want to know the details let me know.   Let me know if you have problems removing him and I will further explain why I think our individuals are at risk.

Robert,

Per your suggestion, I am presenting the potential of an internal transfer for David Hernandez.  David was on redeployment from EBS and landed in EES's Portfolio Origination group.  He has interest in moving into Wholesale Service's Power Origination area.  Dave Duran has the intention of offering a lateral transfer (as a Commercial Manager) for David to move into either Ben Jacoby's or Carl Tricoli's group.

David was not reviewed at mid-year '01, because he was on redeployment, but was rated "3" at Year-end '00, and "1" at mid-year '99.  Could you please run the necessary traps to gain approval of this move.  Let me know if you would care for additional information.

Regards,
Todd Peikert

(1) Kopper isn't EWS but I understood he was Enron. I'll check.
(2) Yes, although my understanding is that Ted has agreed to go work for Billy lemmons in new A&A set up.

Still working on Heizenrader, Richter and Belden - Michelle and I have been in discussions.  

The only concern (nothing on the numbers) is the legal issue that West Power currently faces from California.

Paul received the standard business reorg package as a consequence of the storage group under Jean Mrha being dissolved.   Based on his service and salary, Paul will receive 59,232.92 (assuming he signs a waiver and release)

Additionally, Scott Hendrickson, after 30 days of looking for a position (requested by Lavo), will receive 32,691.38 (assuming he signs a separation agreement).  He was terminated for performance.

going going gone - he was bitter and uncurable:

Left Calpine (and a bunch of options) 2.5 years ago

Did great his first year

Floundered last year

Joined my group in January - felt like he got screwed by Presto and Jacoby

Never got any traction in my group

He will be a better counterparty - left on good terms, not sure where he's going yet

Attached is a short memo and summary outlining changes to the Business School Loan Program for the Western Hemisphere. As many of you know, over the past couple of months we have taken a hard look at our approach to business school loans. The updated guidelines better serve Enron's business interests, eliminate credit exposure for the company, and potentially broaden the reach of the Loan Program. If you have any questions, please contact Ted Bland (x35275) who leads Career Development for the Program.

So the scoop is He is Average.

He recently moved out of Bandwidth 6 weeks ago and back into Continental Power trading - why he is moving again after 6 weeks.  Is it a problem with the business or him?

He worked for Marcello Romano (Head of Bandwidth Trading in Europe) as John knows.  Marcello says he is a solid hard worker who has no edge.  If Marcello were to run UK Gas again he wouldn't take him - as he is not sharp.  So he wouldn't bother to move him across the Atlantic if it costs a lot.

Your call.  Ring Marcello for more information.

Courtney:  I am not sure if you can help me with this but I wanted to try and find someone that could help.  At today's all employee meeting during the Q&A,  someone asked a question about Enron's involvement in Mexico.  The lady that responded to the question mentioned that they are looking for good people to staff the Monterrey, MX office.  

I looked at the Enron jobs listing but found no entries for Mexico.  Do you know how I could find out more about opportunities in Mexico?  If you could give me a name or number that would be great.  (I have no idea who my HR rep or if he or she would know anything about international positions).

Thanks,

Sorry it was not clear.  We pay them $200MM++ and sell them 7X24 power for $61.  The $200MM++ is the PV difference between $61 and our actual offer ($39).

This enables them to get cash and also recognize earnings on part of their DWR contracts.

Their current capital markets stuff is going well - maybe we're wrong about them.

In your previous email by the way - did you mean we pay them or they pay us.  I read they pay us but Carl tells me it was the other way.

My only concern is that John (I am told) spoke to gas and power folks at his staff meeting a while back on the process on transfers. As long as they are rated a 3 or higher in PRC then they did not need to have it approved. Most go through HR, however, some we find out after the fact. I am just trying to make sure we could meet your expectation.  Do you want to say something at your next staff meeting?

Louise, prior to you sending me the revised guidelines on transfers/hires last week, I wanted to give you details on the folks that were already in process before the change:


1.  Steve Bartlet received a transfer offer from Lloyd Don Miller in asset market effective 9/1/01.  Don had indicated that he had planned to speak to you Monday 8/27/01.  He did considerable investigation on this employee to ascertain that he would be a fit for the group.  The employee was rated a 4 at midyear.

2.  Dave Ingram was hired by Dana Davis to do realtime trading at the senior specialist level.  He was a transfer from EBS as a redeployed employee. Feedback was positive and he was rated a 3 at mid year and excellent at yearend.


3.  Eric Simpson was hired to work for Fletch Sturm as a commerical director.  He was rated 1 at midyear and a 2 at yearend. As per the email I recceived from Kevin Presto, I am told that both you and John are aware.


4.  Berney Aucoin in EWS made an offer to an analyst out of the program for a specialist level (flat compensation). Rogers Herndon approved as this employee was rated a 5 at midyear, however, they feel in the past that he was not appropriately guided at EWS.  They feel that they can assist in turning this employee around and have developed a Performance Improvement Plan. Robert Jones is aware.


5.  Steve Irvin was in the process of making an offer to Carlos Alatorre for the Monterrey office. I believe that you are aware as this employee would be a transfer from EOL.  I am awaiting a response from Steve on the status.


I will be sending out a note to Kevin, Dave, Don, Steve, Rogers and both Jaimes to let them know about the change in process on what you would like to be included on going forward.

John/Louise

As of now I will also be working on the general A&A pool for ENA as well as working with you on the Trading and Orig. Tracks.    I just got the numbers from the A&A program on the ENA Participation on the forthcoming A&A Fantastic Friday/Super Saturday Interview dates.   As you can see ENA's participation is very low (pretty dismal).      The de-brief sessions basically allows interviewers to select the candidates to their groups there and then... so ENA has to be there.    

Oct 26 has only 5 ENA interviewers all the remaining interviewers are EES and EIM.    I know EES are stacking quite heavy on the A&A side.    Therefore, I will shortly be e:mailing your direct reports to solicit their and their direct report's participation in these interviews. It would be helpful if this could be re-inforced by you.

Many thanks!.

Karen.

Hi Louise.
I received this spreadsheet from Gemma Butler in London which shows all Director-level and above employees for EEL.
No filters are currently active, and all Female employees are at the top.

 << File: EEL Directors-Gender.xls >> 

Unfortunately, myself and Jean have limited knowledge of the people in the international offices.
Would you be able to identify possible candidates for us?
Here is a breakdown of the current state of the presentation...

Females:
8 Commercial, 1 EEL
6 CS/ ST, no EEL

Males:
10 Commercial, 4 EEL
6 CS/ST, no EEL (primarily have ST).

I think we need a few additional Commercial Females, and a few Male & Female CS candidates to give us a balanced portfolio.
Although I think the London office will be closed by the time I get the names to them today, we should have their data by early next week.
Also, I have included a spreadsheet which includes the career data for the employees Marcello Romano identified, as well as a few others.
There does not appear to be the type of candidates you are wanting, but i'll let you make the call.

Sunjay

Kari,

John wants us to look at a new contract for Tych which is more in line with the ones we have done just recently. Can you:

?	Let me know what John's original spreadsheet indicated as a recommendation
?	What we have given him in his current contract (signed last Nov)
?	What we have given to his direct reports.

I'll get with Louise/John and agree what is appropriate.

David

Louise:

I will be completing my assignment in Bolivia as President of Gas TransBoliviano at the end of September of this year. Currently I am looking for an assignment back to Houston.  Mark asked me to contact you regarding possible position in your organization. I have been with Enron for the last 20 years in various business development positions. Attached is a copy of my resume. I will be in Houston from August 14th to 17th and would like to meet with you at your convenience.  

Regards,

Nasim Khan

Ordinarily fine, however;

This was a pre-petition commitment by Enron and is not necessarily now a commitment of the estate
Presuming we get purchased, things should return to normal presuming the buyer honors all these commitment (that's how we have set it up).

Hi Louise,
I was cleaning out my e-mails since we're migrating over to Outlook from Lotus Notes and came across the following...it reminded me of a certain highly paid admin...It was good to see you on Sat, best of luck for the remaining of the week!

Avril


With the consolidation of several units under Enron Net Works, we would like to remind everyone of the Time Reporting Policy for non-exempt employees to ensure that we have a consistent and fair application of the Policy:

Employees are expected to begin work promptly at their regularly scheduled starting time and manage their work time productively.  Each full-time employee is expected to work a minimum of 8 hours per day and 40 hours per week.  Non-exempt employees are to receive pay for overtime hours worked consistent with Company policy and law.  Supervisors should ensure that overtime is approved in advance and properly reported for non-exempt workers.  Supervisors should also be notified in a timely fashion in the event a non-exempt employee will be out ill, etc.  It would also be helpful if the non-exempt employee contacted their administrative back-up to ensure adequate departmental coverage.

As a general rule, non-exempt employees should not be working at home to "make-up" time missed at work during the week, nor should they be accumulating overtime hours by working at home.  All non-exempt employees should document time missed from work as either sick time, vacation time or personal time with or without pay.  Please note that all time being documented as personal time with pay requires supervisor approval.  Personal time with pay should be used in only limited circumstances.  Any employee documenting more than 16 hours of personal time in a calendar year, will require prior approval from the Division VP and the VP of Human Resources to ensure policy compliance.

The designation, "Family Time with Pay" is to be used in instances of time off for the death of an immediate family member, or as otherwise indicated by policy.  Hours missed during the day for personal appointments, etc. may be made up within the same week and should be documented accordingly on the timesheets.

All assistant timesheets should be approved by the Administrative Coordinator or lead in the group and should be signed each pay period by the employee and the immediate supervisor.  If there is no lead in the group, then the signed timesheets should be forwarded each pay period to either Executive Assistant in the Office of the Chairman.

Thank you for your adherence to this policy.

I would be interested in your views but I don't see Paul as a star right now.  What
are your views on his next steps within the company.  But on the broader front
we may want to look at a legal review of the Popemeister's non-poach provisions
of his old agreement.

Louise,

I have spoke with Faith this morning and the 2 economic administrators for Central's books.  The business was being reflected in 4 different books on the report I received from you/Faith, Central Mid-Market, Mid-West Gas, Central Origination, and Middle Market-Central Gas Total.  This break out is inconsistent with the manner I reconcile this business daily and provided difficulty in determining the tie out to each of the originators.  This is one business, not to the specific of me, but to a group of talented people who I want to represent in the most accurate manner.  I simply wanted to prevent the information for this group being represented in a different method than I would be presenting on their behalf.  

Laura

Per our discussion, enovate and Central are the same.  enovate/Chicago and Central Desk/Houston should be included in my teams numbers and are reflective of my goals/objectives for the year 2001.  One number should be viewed as Central/Origination.

Thanx,

It might be quicker to just take the number from the DPR and split it out into a number by originator, as we do need the information for Monday's prc.  The numbers below are the total per region which need dividing up by originator.

Frank		$8,261,000
Enovate	$6,219,000
Laura		$2,357,000
Fred		$19,465,000

Please send back the divided numbers to both Faith and I.

Hi Louise,

As requested, attached is a file that contains June YTD Originations by Originator.

We've arranged the file in the following sorts:

?	by team
?	by Originator (sorted alphabetically)
?	by Originator (sorted by value)
?	Top 10 Overall Originators by Value
?	Top 10 Originators- Gas
?	Top 10 Originators- Power

An item to note is that not all deals had a related individual's name (such as Enduser)- we left the listing as it appears in the Risk Book in these cases.

We'll send you an update if the DPR amounts move (the DPR isn't final yet.)

Please let me know if you need any additional information!

I just spoke to Lavo and he said the same thing.   We are planning on offering Willis an Associate position in East Power.   I propose we offer 75k salary with 25k sign-on.   We would require a 90 day evergreen non-compete and payback of 25k retention in the event he left within the the 1st year.

Kim - Can you please prepare the offer package based on the above.

Carlos has informed me that he has been told he will likely be laid off. 

You may wish to consider intervening to keep him:

- If the new purchaser is interested in the TexMex concept, Carlos is the most important Mexican link. He has great relationships, has negotiated MOU's and is close to contract with multiple customers.

- If we desire to retain EnronOnline expertise, Carlos has it.

- He is still on the US payroll and has an Enron working visa.

I regret to decline to review Jean. I went through the form for her but was not able to provide nearly enough meaningful feedback to justify.  I have worked a lot with Jean over time, but mostly indirectly this period.  We have had occasional interaction (a couple brief meetings and a couple phone conversations) about the development and status of the wellhead book.  In addition, she did attend one of the inter-departmental wellhead book meetings that I hosted and we have collaborated on Analysts/Associates, but I have not really worked closely with her this period.  She may feel that we have worked more together that we have based on the time I have spent with John Grass and others related to the wellhead book, but my direct interaction with her has been minimal.

On the positive side, she has been very helpful by identifying good Analysts/Associates for me.  She thinks highly of gas structuring as a rotation opportunity and she is one of my best advocates with the Analysts/Associates.  She worked with me to let me take Kelli Little (Assoc) when some of the deals she was working on were put on hold.  Furthermore, she has forwarded resumes and/or had individuals contact me several times this period.

On the negative side, I am not sure why she seemingly let John Grass struggle so long in the development of the wellhead book.  I know she championed the idea and sold the idea to the office of the chair, but from my perspective she gave the ball to John and turned her attention too quickly to other opportunities.  The wellhead book is John's responsibility, but it ultimately rests with her.  With John's relatively short time in ENA and his lack of network, she could have aided in giving him more direction and support  from the outset.  To her credit she seems more engaged lately, especially with the Producer 1 initiative.   

I hope that helps.  I would be happy to answer any questions you may have or discuss further as necessary.

Regards,
Ed

PS.  Congratulations on the birth of your baby!  I hope you are enjoying the time off.

Kevin,

I have worked with this guy at EBS for the past year and think he is a good candidate for the group.  He has worked for Marcello Romano (he has a favorable view of him also).  He traded oil products at Goldman a few years back and is interested in coming to the U.S. from our London office.  

Let me know what you think.  Perhaps Louise can weigh in also if she knows him.  

John

Sorry its all prepetition.

I already claimed the flights, now I will not be using them as I can not go home.  I am using the money to pay for my parents's flights although not all of the money will be used.  The rest of the money I intend to offset against expense checks which bounced.    Should there be an imbalance - I will sort this out with Enron once payments have been completed on expense checks.

OK?

Ordinarily fine, however;

This was a pre-petition commitment by Enron and is not necessarily now a commitment of the estate
Presuming we get purchased, things should return to normal presuming the buyer honors all these commitment (that's how we have set it up).

As you know I have Business Flights home each year under my contract.  As I will be unable to travel to the UK due to the requirement to be in Houston over the holidays I intend to use them for my parents, borther and sister-in-law.  Any difference in the cost I intend to cover or offset against the cheques from expenses which bounced until we can figure out whether Enron intends to meet expense payments.

I talked with Jeanie Slone today regarding the project  you'd like me to work on for the next few months.  I told Jeanie I will be  able to start on August 13th.  (I will be out of town August 1-4th, then  again August 7-10th.)  I would sure appreciate your calling or e-mailing me  before the 13th with a quick overview of what you see my role in this transition  before I show up on the 13th--what needs to be done, issues, what has been done  to date, who I will be working with, etc.

As you all know, the recruiting season is in full swing and the AA Program's recruiters are hitting campus as we speak.  One of the most important parts of the process and a key to Enron's future success are the Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday interview dates where we make the selections on those candidates who will receive offers from Enron for the 2002 recruiting class.  It is important that these candidates be interviewed by business leaders from each business unit and specifically those who utilize AA pool members.  Our goal is for each business unit to identify a core group of interviewers for each of the four interview weekends which will be held as follows:

		Dates						Total Number of Interviewers Needed**

October 25-26           Fantastic Friday - Analysts			100		30 for dinner/70 for interview        
November 2 -4 -        Super Saturday - Associates		100		30 for dinner/70 for interview		
November 15-16        Fantastic Friday - Analysts			100		30 for dinner/70 for interview
November 30-Dec 1   Super Saturday - Associates		100		30 for dinner/70 for interview

I have attached a list of those individuals in various business units that have participated in the interview process in the past for your review (as a sample of the type of individual we are looking for as interviewers).  Please provide me a list of your business unit's interviewers by date by Friday, October 5.  Individuals are encouraged to interview more than one selected date and we will forward details to them at least a week prior to the interview date.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.  Thanks again for all your help.  Ted and Traci

 
**  We do not expect you to provide all the interviewers.  This number reflects to total needed from all business units and will include those needed for both the evening and interview days..

Louise, 

The attached DASH is not final, but may circulate later today.  Mark Haedicke has the legal risk memo - the attorney (Karen Jones) characterizes the risk as very low (our information and knowledge reps are qualified and capped at 10%).  We are hoping to sign as early as today or Monday, but funding may not occur until after Sep 30 (we will push hard to get funds in this quarter).  Regardless of cash timing, income recognition of approx $1MM can be accounted for in Q3 as planned.

Regards,

Louise,

Thanks for the quick response.  I have considered the offer, and feel that a Director's position would not be of interest to me.

If something else comes up, do let me know.

Tammie, sorry it has taken so long to respond.  The meeting dates and times have been changing rapidly and I wanted to make certain the information was fairly firm.  There are two additional meetings that Louise will need to be aware of since she has individuals in Power that will be reviewed. She can make the decision on whether she needs to attend either of these meeting.  While I believe that the Technical Meeting should have adequate BU representation, if Louise feels strongly that she would like to attend, she should contact Jeanie Slone x53847 as soon as possible.

1.  The ENA Commercial Support PRC will be held this THURSDAY, JUNE 21 beginning at 2:00 pm in the Cottonwood room at the Hyatt .  

Commercial Support Specialists, Sr Specialists and Managers will be reviewed.  

If you have any questions or scheduling conflicts, please contact Jeanie Slone at X53847.

2.  The Technical Meeting for ENA/EGM has been combined w/ EEOS.    The meeting will take two days.  The schedule for the meetings is June 21 and 22nd.  Further information will be forthcoming shortly.

If you are referring to their career progression data, it is not readily available as for domestic employees.
I have to send names to the London office, and a few days later I recieve spreadsheets similar to the one i sent earlier.

Hi Louise.
I received this spreadsheet from Gemma Butler in London which shows all Director-level and above employees for EEL.
No filters are currently active, and all Female employees are at the top.

 << File: EEL Directors-Gender.xls >> 

Unfortunately, myself and Jean have limited knowledge of the people in the international offices.
Would you be able to identify possible candidates for us?
Here is a breakdown of the current state of the presentation...

Females:
8 Commercial, 1 EEL
6 CS/ ST, no EEL

Males:
10 Commercial, 4 EEL
6 CS/ST, no EEL (primarily have ST).

I think we need a few additional Commercial Females, and a few Male & Female CS candidates to give us a balanced portfolio.
Although I think the London office will be closed by the time I get the names to them today, we should have their data by early next week.
Also, I have included a spreadsheet which includes the career data for the employees Marcello Romano identified, as well as a few others.
There does not appear to be the type of candidates you are wanting, but i'll let you make the call.

Faith:

Here is a spreadsheet that summarizes the individual contributions for West Power Middle Market and West Power Services.  A couple thoughts:

	-	Please make sure the dollars are distributed to the individuals so credit is given where credit is due.  Although I wish I made the money currently indicated in 		the tables, obviously the numbers represent the total for all of us.

	-	Services Desk P&L is the responsibility of Greg Wolfe and he is a leading originator for the coverage group.  The attached table reflects the sum of both 		groups.

	-	Some of the contributors to Middle Market West Power are non-commercial (Cocke, Rawson) while others are not technically in the Middle Market Group 		although the P&L they generate is (Mainzer, Scholtes).

	-	I am concerned that the origination tracking taking place is going to overstate the importance of origination and underestimate the importance of other 	Middle 		Market "Coverage" behaviors such as number of Master Agreements put in place, number of new accounts brought in, etc.  A couple of fairly easy metrics 		would be:  1)  number of EEI/ISDA contracts; 2)  number of transactions;  3)  number of different counter parties transacting; and 4)  number of EOL clients 		brought in.  Quantifying these few items should be relatively simple and go a long way toward measuring coverage.   

		We currently measure these coverage metrics and it is my understanding that other Middle Marketing Groups do as well.  It should be relatively 			simple to begin assimilating this data and including it in the data you are collecting for all of ENA Middle Market.  

		Perhaps non-Middle Market Origination Groups can measure certain behaviors as well.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!

Chris

Hi Louise,

As requested, attached is a file that contains June YTD Originations by Originator.

We've arranged the file in the following sorts:

?	by team
?	by Originator (sorted alphabetically)
?	by Originator (sorted by value)
?	Top 10 Overall Originators by Value
?	Top 10 Originators- Gas
?	Top 10 Originators- Power

An item to note is that not all deals had a related individual's name (such as Enduser)- we left the listing as it appears in the Risk Book in these cases.

We'll send you an update if the DPR amounts move (the DPR isn't final yet.)

Please let me know if you need any additional information!

where do we stand now?  last i heard was an e-mail from oxley (which is on lotus notes and not accessible anymore) which said that we don't think that we are going to get there, but hold on for a few more days while we finalize our decision and craft a really nice decline speech.  it's been a few weeks now, and i am checking status.  do you still want to offer him the initial contract?  i doubt he'd take it but i need to know.  what would you change with his proposal that would be acceptable?  i think that mike has taken this negotiation seriously and deserves a timely resolution.

Chaps,

The team have identified 17 Manager and Director level Commercial candidates which we are looking to bring in for a super-saturday type event primarily for Duran's area. We'll refine list and may see some fall out before the (yet to be arranged) day.

It seems some of these guys may be of interest to EGM as well. Unless you have a huge problem the plan would be to invite Per Sekse and maybe someone from Nowlan's area to join the panel. Maybe they will want one or two that we don't.

Do you want to interview?

Many of you know Dale Furrow already.  For those who don't, he ran our structuring group in Portland from late 1997 until the middle of 1999.  He's an Army Grad, Wharton Grad, went through the Associate program and left Enron as a Director to join Entergy's Asset Development group working for Jeff Roberts.  He recently tendered his resignation at Entergy and is on the job market.  He is leaving Entergy on good terms -- he simply decided that he doesn't like working there for a variety of reasons.

Dale has a great background for many of the EES/EWS work that we are trying to do now.  He was an AWESOME structurer.  He "gets" trading.  He was responsible for the development and implementation of Entergy Power Marketing's risk systems.  In short, he would be a great catch for us.

I will be in Houston Monday and Tuesday of next week.  I will interview Dale on Tuesday.  I know that Louise and John are in PRC on Tuesday, so they would have to do it later.  Perhaps the rest of us could meet him on Tuesday.  

I don't yet have a specific job nailed down for him.  I think that he could run a URM desk (east or west).  He could run the site profile, asset profile, dsm group.  I would expect that he would expect to come in at a VP level.  I know that's a high bar and hard to do here, which is why I would want this group of people to meet with him.  I have asked Debra Davidson to contact each of you to coordinate these interviews.

Thanks,
Tim

Your Invitation to Enron's Executive Forum

The Office of the Chairman would like to invite you to participate in an Enron Executive Forum.  This invitation is extended to those who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the past few years.  These informal, interactive forums will be approximately 90 minutes in length and held several times per year.  

Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although attendance is not mandatory, the forums are designed to address those issues.  They also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to its executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do "reality checks", create a "rallying point" and ensure Enron's executive management is on the "same page" about where Enron is going---and why.

We realize that individuals based outside the United States will not want to make a special trip to attend the meeting, but may be able to attend one of the sessions while they are in Houston on other business.  We also hope to schedule a similar session in London later this year.

We currently have a session planned for:

Wednesday, June 20, 2001 from 3:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Houston, EB50M

The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here's how it will work:
?	Each session will have approximately 25 participants.
?	The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue.
?	This will be your forum. Don't expect to simply sit and listen to presentations.
?	This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own questions and express your own opinions.
?	You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum.
?	Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not limited to: the
direction of Enron, business goals/results, M&A activities, projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity, values, etc.

Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we encourage you to accept this invitation only if you intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to do the same.  We also ask that you refrain from canceling your attendance once enrolled so that we will not have to cancel the forum.  The Office of the Chairman is very willing to take valuable time from their busy schedules to hold these forums.  Enrollments will be on a first come first served basis and we hope you would be able to honor your commitment to attend.  For planning purposes, it is essential that you RSVP no later than Monday, June 11, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586.

We will confirm your registration with you, in writing and forward a list of enrollees to the Office of the Chairman.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson via e-mail (gerry.gibson@enron.com).  Gerry can also be reached at 713.345.6806.  

Thank you.

Maybe.

Who is on the desk? How much have they made in the past? How good a market is it? Who would I report to?

It is in Houston so I would have to think hard. Also I could not leave straight away as I need to settle things down here.
What do you think?

Louise,

We are thrilled that you will meet us at the Cathedral House facility and join us for the debriefing session (if you don't go into labor before tomorrow!). Since the rest of the group will be going to Cathedral House from the Knowledge Beginnings Katy facility on the van, do you need directions to Cathedral House from Enron? If not, we look forward to meeting you at Cathedral House. 

I have visited the Knowledge Beginnings BP facility, but since the Enron child care center will be closer to the new Knowledge Beginnings Katy facility, the Katy facility was selected as one of our tour stops.

I look forward to meeting you tomorrow!

Regards,

Charla

I will attend the Cathedral House facility and debriefing session.  I would suggest that you may wish to consider actually visiting the BP facility which is not an open facility (company specific) as this may be more akin to what we will get.

I could give you my choice now (its easy) but I will wait until the debriefing session.

Per Sarah Davis' voice mail:

As we prepare to open Enron's child care center this fall, we invite you to join Cindy Olson, Beth Tilney and Sarah Davis on a tour of local child care centers to observe best practices in the Houston child care community. Your feedback is vital in helping us develop the best child care center for our employees. Though the tour will consume a significant part of your day, we believe that the knowledge gained from our site visits will be worth it. 

The tour will take place on Thursday, May 3rd. Our agenda follows:

	10:30 AM	Depart from front of Enron building via van
	11:15 AM	Tour Creme de la Creme Town and Country facility
	12:45 PM	Tour Knowledge Beginnings Katy facility
	2:15 PM	Tour Cathedral House Montessori School downtown facility
	3:30 PM	Debriefing Session (EB 1679) 
	4:15 PM	Adjourn


Thank you so much for taking time out of your busy schedules to participate in this tour! Please RSVP to me at X-36202 no later than Wednesday at 10:00 AM to confirm your attendance. We look forward to seeing you Thursday!


Regards,

Charla Stuart

Ok. My feelings are that it is down to EEL to decide who should do their expats returns at PWc. My conversation with Drew, Tara and Jim concluded with them deciding that they and their expats liked Phil and although they had made everyone aware of this issue they were going to give him another chance.

My advice is to let it go.

That they are keeping Hawkins in London and nobody bothered to reply to my message - so I rang Sherriff and told him what had happened - he is now spooked because he doesn't even check his tax return - he just signs them.

I partly annoyed because they didn't respond to my message nor tell Sherriff anything of the problems.

If this has not been done - I would like to know who is requesting Phillip is retained.  I spoke to John who was not aware of the issues - he does feel that this tax year is out of the question.  But going forward this should be an issue - John was also unaware of the advice I had been given which is clearly incorrect.

Why did I receive no response to this email should the action I requested not have been implemented.

 I have recently had some very bad experiences with Philip's advice and suggest that he is removed from Enron's account completely.  Obviously David has had him removed from working on anything this side of the Atlantic.

I feel strongly that Enron employees should not be exposed to the potential liabilities which could be incurred through incorrect advice and would suggest your side of the water remove him also in the interests of Enron as a whole.

If you want to know the details let me know.   Let me know if you have problems removing him and I will further explain why I think our individuals are at risk.

This isn't the ex-metals trader from Koch?

What level is he?  What is the package - director or below?

We would like to hire Willis Phillips from Koch.   Rogers, Dana, & I have all interviewed him and think he is a can't miss candidate.   The bad news is that he was referred by a headhunter (the fee is 20% of first year package).

This guy is quality and I want to make an offer.   Please let me know if I can proceed ASAP.

Below is the final report I plan to run on our progress in monitoring and tracking completed mid-year written evaluation forms across the North American employee base (who were a part of the PRC process).

Ken Rice recommended that at refer this person to you.  He has been with Dell for 6 years and is interested in joining one of Enron's trading or origination businesses.

Do you have any interest in him?

This guy is one of the people from Dell Ventures that we have worked with.  He is interested in joining Enron (specifically the trading/origination side of Enron).  I think he might fit best in ENA.  Who should I refer him to?

Kevin;

Thanks for the time this morning.  As I mentioned, after 6+ very successful
years at Dell in program management, product management, and business
development, I'm starting to consider the possibility of leaving.  Given my
experiences here, leveraging the power of commoditizing (Intel-based
servers) markets, a natural next step is a company like Enron.  Any
appropriate introductions would be greatly appreciated.

Regards ... msg

P.S.  I've also sent your name to Ray Bell at SmartPipes.  What they're
doing could be a natural complement to Enron's efforts in the bandwidth
space.

Louise,

First - congratulations on the new baby!  Life has just changed big time in case you haven't already noticed (I have 3 daughters myself).  Best wishes on your new addition.

Second - I wanted to test your interest on being the exec lead for Carnegie-Mellon Associate Recruiting this fall.  I've been assuming (maybe incorrectly) that with your new responsibilities (home and work) that you might pass on it this year - but I want that to be your decision.  If you want to do it, we certainly would appreciate your help.  If you can't do it, I'd appreciate any recommendation you might have for a replacement.  I'd prefer a senior level (VP or above) alum, if possible.  I'll find someone if no names come to mind immediately.

Take care and I hope all is well,
Billy

Louise and Marcus,

I hope you were all (including extended family members) safe and sound during the recent storms and that there was no damage to your home, your belongings or your family traveling to and from the airport.

Criminal Check:
As fate would have it, instead of going by the county clerks office on Friday when I left, I decided to go on Monday morning.  Due to the storms, they are still inoperable.  I will continue to follow-up and will definitely be one of the first in line when they open.

Packet:
I have received no packets.  As you recall I ordered two last week.  I have left voice mails today and yesterday with no response.  They could be flooded as well.  I will continue to try to ascertain the status of the information packet.

Taxes:
I spoke with Richard Frank, CPA and will provide him all of our (pertinent) email information regarding the nanny and tax issues.  Once he reviews it he will contact Marcus and/or myself regarding outstanding questions.

Misc:
I am hand delivering the I-9 form, SS4 form and the information I obtained from Enron Life Works/the new enron kids' center to Marcus today.
  
Welcome Summer!
Best Regards,
Bobbi

Jeanie:

Here is a highlight of my accomplishments for the first six months of 2001.
	- Participated in identifying and resolving issues related to the sell of HPL assets to AEP.
	-  developed a mechanism for Enron to fill Bammel Storage prior to the sell to AEP and be hedged against the sell to AEP.
	- Negotiated and signed a three year storage agreement with Centana allowing for very favorable late summer / winter withdrawals with reduced commodity charges
	  and very flexible receipt and delivery points.
	- Predicted weekly AGA activity with extreme accuracy compared to the rest of the market.
	- Generated $26 million in trading profits.  Despite not having the Bammel Storage Facility to make me look good like in previous years.  Like for example in 2000
	   the 2001 April - October versus the Decemeber - February spread went from a positive $.28 on 1/4/2000 to a negative $.04 on 12/31/2000 which generated a loss of 	   $17,600,000 and this was only one of seven years.  Since 12/31/2000 that spread has gone from a negative $.04 to a positive $.65 which would have generated 	   income of $38,000,000 but I did not get any of that impact since the facility was sold.  But wait a minute that didn't make me look good did it????????

		Thanks, Jim

Importance:	High

Louise Kitchen/John Lavorato have requested that each of you prepare a brief one page summary highlighting your accomplishments for this review period by end of day Friday, June 29, 2001.  

You may use the PEP system and do a self-evaluation (let me know if you need assistance w/this) or send me an email bullet pointing your accomplishments.  If you have already done a self-eval, you do not need to respond to this email.  HR is compiling the information for OOTC and I appreciate your assistance/timely response.  I apologize for the quick turn around-just got the request myself.

Please call or email w/any questions.  Thanks.
