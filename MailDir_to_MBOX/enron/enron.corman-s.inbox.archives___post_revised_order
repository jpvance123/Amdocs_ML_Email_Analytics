Attached is the TW Top Ten Shippers by Revenues for the year 2001 to be reported in the Browncover report.

 




Note:

Total transportation invoiced for 2001 was $180.9m.  The amount of transportation revenues recorded in the general ledger is $165.9m.

This difference is mainly due to the following:
$10.0m   -   negotiated rates reserve(Reliant,Sempra, Richardson, Astr,and BP Energy) - $collected
$ 2.7m   -    SoCal rate issue - $not collected
$ 1.8m   -    additional month of PGE revenues due to prepayment invoicing beginning in 2001 - $collected
Revenues for these customers were adjusted according.  

Also, revenues for the shippers acquiring released volumes from PGE at rates above TW's tariff rates were adjusted accordingly.

Please call me at x36709 if there are questions

thanks,
richard

ADDITIONAL NAESB BOARD NOTES
During the Board meeting, a Provisional Activity was moved to the active section of the annual plan.  The intent was to only move the partial day recall order.  However, the provisional item included two FERC orders -- related to partial day recalls and affiliates.  I couldn't hear the discussion, but have been informed that the affiliate order was not mentioned and that the entire item was moved.  This needs to be corrected so the affiliate order is not on NAESB's annual plan.  I'll work with the EC reps to determine how we want to handle.  Your suggestions are welcome.
Per NAESB's Certificate, a Board member cannot have a substitute at a Board meeting.  During yesterday's meeting, Jack Hawks sat in and VOTED for his boss, Lyn Maddox (Services - PG&E Energy Trading).  Jack has been very involved in the Wholesale Electric Quadrant.  Immediately after the meeting, Boswell and Jay Costan were questioned about this voting.  Jay stated it is allowed per NAESB governance, but then determined it is not.  After some dancing and backpedaling, they noted that the resolution would go out for notational vote.  I don't have the vote count on the adoption of the quadrant procedures.  The promotional dues would not have been adopted without Jack's vote.
Shelley -- You asked what company Boswell works for.  I've been told that he is a "non-employee officer" of Dominion.  The NAESB listing of Board members states he is "Assistant Secretary, Dominion".  He is also a partner at McGuire Woods -- same firm as Jay Costan.  During meetings (including non-NAESB), I've heard him introduce himself only as Chairman of NAESB's Board of Directors; he doesn't give a company affiliation.  His e-mail address is McGuire Woods.
The voting on quadrant procedures did not synch up with my discussion with Rae.  She stated the votes would be simple majority; super majority votes were taken.  Some people feel NAESB officers were concerned that some segments would not support the procedures, which would bring NAESB to a standstill.  My call to Rae may have piqued their curiosity and raised concerns.  We'll see whether this item remains on Jay Costan's list of errors in the bylaws.
Bill Boswell will soon appoint Board members to the new Parliamentary Committee.  It will consist of two members from each Quadrant (not each Segment) and will address governance issues (e.g., Certificate, Bylaws, Operating Procedures).  It's been suggested that the Pipeline Board members should try to get a seat on that committee.  Recommendations from the Parliamentary Committee should still be voted by the entire Board.  However, their recommendations from a Board committee will have a good chance of being adopted.  My feeling is that Ron Mucci may be interested; I've heard no discussion.

RATES AND REVENUE (RRS)
I've met with Gerry Medeles and Jim Studebaker to discuss RRS.  Initially, I'll attend most meetings to get up to speed and to help where I can with business requirements.  I'm also reviewing as much of the documentation as possible to gather information.

TRADING PARTNER AGREEMENT (TPA)
I've met with Mary Draemer to discuss our pro forma TPA.  It's my understanding that we are using the language of the GISB (NAESB) standard agreement.  We don't know the history of our TPA, but at some point the standard agreement was reformatted and the GISB standard number and copyright info was deleted.
I'll prepare our pro forma TPA, based on the GISB standard.  I'll add certain pieces of information, which we include in our posted pro forma, to the standard agreement.  This will be routed to the attorneys to give them a quick heads-up.  I'll explain that the content has not been changed.
I'll prepare the agreements for UBS and send to them for execution.  The agreements will then be routed to the attorney and then to Shelley for execution.
Shelley -- Will you sign for NNG?  If not, who will sign?


NAESB EDM SUBCOMMITTEE
The EDM Subcommittee has begun having frequent meetings.  They have three requests on their plate in addition to their requirement to review the appendices in the EDM book to determine whether updates are needed for the technical characteristics.  The requester wants their changes included in version 1.6.  And, most feel the updates to the appendices are needed in version 1.6.  I'm still working with Terry Lehn on EDM matters.

MOVING NEXT WEEK
My move is scheduled for next Thursday; packed by Wednesday.  I'll do some cleaning out to downsize from office to cubicle.  I'll leave some files in the 47th floor file room until I can go through them.  I want to make sure I have electronic copies before I throw away Board and EC books, standards, etc.  I'll work with Donna Scott on storage.

I added a column to the ENA spreadsheet Shelley requested (as per Sheila's request).  The column shows from whom ENA permanently acquired the firm entitlement capacity.  It is called "Perm. Acq. from" and is located right after the firm entitlement columns.  nb

In reference to our conversation the following are the customers that must prepay prior to the month of service

Frito - Lay $ 10, 370.43 received 12/26/01 for January transportation

Multi Fuels $ 5,329.92 received 12/24/01 for January transportation

The following are customers that due to their internal funding procedures pay early. Example the payment received in early January is for the January demand that will be invoiced the first of February. Also, the following customers have posted Letters of Credit to secure their creditworthiness.

Orange CoGen
Polk Power

The following customer has satisfied the creditworthiness requirements and is no longer required to prepay.

Total Gas and Electric.

Shelley,  An FYI--Teb & I had a conversation w/Raye Grimaard at Peoples Gas=
 today in regard to the scheduling allocation process.  She indicated they =
do not like FGT's process "one little bit" regarding their flexibility to s=
chedule secondary firm in an allocated area.  For instance, when we allocat=
e the market area, and Peoples wants to nominate secondary gas within their=
 path, they feel they should have the priority to do so and not be in he mi=
x for a cut.  Teb was highly concerned about this in light of the implicati=
ons it could have on ultimately changing to a mileage rate base.  Teb argue=
d the point that we rarely cut into firm gas, thus is their threat to file =
with the Ferc for within the path segmentation really necessary.  He asked =
that we have an opportunity to review this with them at greater length befo=
re they file.  In the meantime, I will look into the number of times we hav=
e allocated firm in the market area.  I'm not sure how far back I can get a=
ccurate information though.  I'm afraid it will be more memory facts than h=
ard facts.  Sheila

The first week in April has been set up for the headquarters part of this year's inspection.  The OPS inspector would like to come to Houston to review the gas control and scada facilities and engineering records handling.  He expects to travel on Tuesday and spend Wednesday and Thursday here at Enron Central.   I'll get a copy of the inspection checklist off the web and attempt to highlight the headquarters questions that will be the focus of the visit.  If anyone has already done this task, let me know.
