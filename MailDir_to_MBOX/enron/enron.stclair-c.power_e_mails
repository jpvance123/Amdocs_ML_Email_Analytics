Do you want 6/1/01 and forward or do you want to include all of May since 
they have not been settled?  Just let me know and I can send you a new

Carol - I think Valerie Mooney (our credit person) and Ed Sacks are still
discussing some minor fine tuning of the LOC format.  I spoke to Bob Bruce
this morning - we're all set on the language in the Schedule to the ISDA,
and there is a minor credit/billing issue in Paragraph 13 related to the
timing of transfer of interest on collateral that Val will discuss with Ed
as well.  As far as the EEI goes, the only remaining issue that I'm aware
of (aside from finalizing the LOC) is whether we've finished coordinating
the Attachment containing the list of prior transactions.  Sounds like we
may actually get these documents executed early next week.

The last issue on the listed deals is 586665.  Amy Clemons paid Merrill b/c 
they said it was their deal and Jim T. was incorrect.  I think everything 
else is settled on these deals.  Of course, Joy Werner is still getting 
feedback from Allegheny indicating they do not see some of the deals that 
were transferred in the big transfer.  I sent her the spreadsheet and she 
will forward the list of physical deals that transferred to Allegheny's 
settlements person.  Why can't everyone be as efficient as Enron?  We are the 
best evil empire.

This is the last correspondence I show with Engage on behalf of Janice (other 
than guaranty correspondence) and I can't even find these attachments in her

Deb:
Attached are Enron's revisions to the draft Cover Sheet and Supplement that 
you submitted to us.  Peter Leier asked me to work with you on progressing 
this master in his absence.  
Please note that the credit provisions reflect the discussions that each of 
our credit departments have had over the last several months.  The guarantees 
referred to here have already been negotiated in the context of another deal 
(which will be brought under the umbrella of this Master when it is 
executed), and they are due to be executed and delivered by each party very 
soon.  We have included our standard provision that will bring all 
outstanding transactions listed on  Attachment A under the terms of the EEI 
MAster, but we have not included an attachment yet b/c there may be several 
outstanding transactions by the time we execute this master.  
Also note that my comments have borrowed heavily on the provisions of the 
ISDA agreement and schedule that I understand is being executed this week 
between Engage and Enron North America Corp.  For example, you had checked 
the box on the Cover Sheet electing sec. 2.4 to apply, but that provision 
would be inconsistent with the ISDA Schedule 5(e).
We believe it is preferable to follow the basic structure of the EEI 
documentation as other industry members are doing, leaving the "boilerplate" 
Master unmarked and putting all the changes at the end of the Cover Sheet, 
and so that's where you'll see the standard language that Enron adds to the 
Master.  We believe that, true to the bilateral nature of these arrangements, 
such changes benefit both parties.  Rather than attaching a separate 
Supplement, we would add to the Cover Sheet the changes you proposed in the 
Supplement after we've negotiated those changes.  
Please call me with any questions or comments.


Regards,
Janice

Ed-

Please see attached changes to the LOC Formats proposed by Enron.  I have
revised the draw language and expiration date language to reflect the
changes we agreed to last week.

In addition, I have inserted a paragraph at the end of the LOC form to
reflect a change requested by the bank.  It relates to the ability to
transfer the LOC.  Also attached is the form of transfer statement that the
bank will require if Enron chooses to transfer the LOC to another party.
It looks relatively straight forward and I believe it should be acceptable
to you.

Please review these changes and if acceptable, we can proceed with
execution of the documents.

Rod:

We are looking at doing a June physical index power purchase today with 
Kaiser. however, Kaiser only wants to proceed if we can assure them that we 
can add electricity to the existing ISDA between Enron and Kaiser such that 
they could fix the price during the month of June. After reading your comment 
below about netting it appears that a longer term transaction would not be 
advisable until further legal clarification occurs. Is there any reason we 
can't or shouldn't pursue adding electricity to the ISDA provided we only do 
one month transactions (assuming we see no risk of near term bankrupcty)? 
Please advise immediately.

Tracy,

Did you have a chance to read my email response earlier this week?  I believe 
that it is highly unlikely that we will be able to net exposures across 
non-defaulting (Enron) entities.  Paul Simons can (and maybe has by now) 
given opinion to this idea.  Historically, I believe the opinion has long 
been that such netting (set-off against affiliates of non-defaulting party) 
in the US should work within the case of contractual default, but outside of 
bankruptcy.  However, in the special case of legal bankruptcy, such netting 
(though contractually agreed by the parties) may be challenged.  Introducing 
the fact that one of Enron's entities is a UK entity may further cloud the 
likelihood.  Clearly, if the relationship involves more than on Kaiser 
entity, netting almost certainly will not work.

Has Diana not responded to your credit exposure questions regarding the form 
of governing confirmation and legal entity?  I believe that she is in the US, 
but should be checking in.  Perhaps you should try calling her?  I think we 
will find that the transacting entity is a subsidiary of Kaiser Aluminum.

Risk management systems for metals are still not ideal.  Volumetric/CVAR type 
analysis may not yield such reliable results.

Subject: Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corporation - UK and US swaps
Importance: High

Rod,

Enron North America is looking to enter into power swaps with Kaiser Aluminum 
& Chemical Corporation starting June 2001.  I'm seeing in the credit system 
that MG plc has forward financial metals positions with Kaiser, however I 
need clarification on whether the swaps are done with Kaiser Aluminum & 
Chemical Corporation or Kaiser Aluminum International Inc.  Secondly, is 
there a Master ISDA Agreement governing those swaps?  In pulling the mtm 
monthly breakout, it appears that MG plc is OTM north of $10MM US and the 
liquidation of that portfolio occurs mostly in cal '02.

Given Kaiser's limited credit line, I'd like to look into the potential of 
setting off financial exposures in the UK and US in cases of default.  Kaiser 
is looking at other businesses with Enron and this could be quite fruitful to 
tap into in order to increase trading liquidity going forward.

In summary, we need to answer at minimum the following:
? confirmation of which Kaiser entity is financial transacting with MG plc
? volatility of the metal positions that go out to Jan '04 to ensure how 
quickly this out-of-the-money position can move
? what type of paper is confirming the swaps (whether long-form confirms or 
Master ISDA)
? what credit/legal terms and laws may affect our efforts to establish a 
Netting Agreement for UK and US financial

Can you help me in coordinating a meeting with London legal/credit and 
Portland credit/Houston legal to discuss pertinent issues associated with a 
Netting Agreement between Kaiser (single entity or multiple entities) and 
Enron entities (MG plc and ENA) as soon as possible.  Please let me know your 
thoughts to the above and who we need to contact to get the above points 
addressed.  In Houston legal, Carol St. Clair is available to work on the 
drafting of such a Netting Agreement and is speaking with Sara Shackleton 
about the concept as well.

Please let me know as soon as possible your comments to the above and in 
setting up a conference call to push this forward.

Thanks,
Tracy

Carol - I think Valerie Mooney (our credit person) and Ed Sacks are still
discussing some minor fine tuning of the LOC format.  I spoke to Bob Bruce
this morning - we're all set on the language in the Schedule to the ISDA,
and there is a minor credit/billing issue in Paragraph 13 related to the
timing of transfer of interest on collateral that Val will discuss with Ed
as well.  As far as the EEI goes, the only remaining issue that I'm aware
of (aside from finalizing the LOC) is whether we've finished coordinating
the Attachment containing the list of prior transactions.  Sounds like we
may actually get these documents executed early next week.

Carol - It is hard for me to concur without hearing from Jim as to exactly 
which trades he views as Allegheny's.

Jim - Let's go through the list on Monday, ok ?

Carol and Chris,
I'm not sure Sharon knows what she is doing.  If we accept her blacklined 
changes, it seems to me we go back to the original EEI language about 
penalties which we like.  Perhaps we should just try this. The drafting 
technique she wants to use does not get her where she thinks it does.

If and when her attorney reads this thing, the issue will be:  do we remain 
silent about penalties, or do we go into more detail?  We want to go into 
more detail if they cannot accept the standard language. 

Our choice seems to be:  1. Tell her we accept her change and sign the cover 
sheet and try to blow it by them, or 2. open the can of worms of more detail 
and get it over with.   Let's discuss this.   ----cgy

Chris, we are leaning more toward the generic language and think that it 
could expedite the approval process.  I have attached the language we propose 
which basically deletes the specific language regarding penalty for 
replacement and sale prices (see section 1.a (1) and (2)in the attached).  I 
wanted to send this to you quickly before you spent a lot of time on the 
other one. THX

Sharon: 

As indicated by my previous e-mail to you, since Shari Stack has left 
Enron, it will take me a couple days to resurrect this EEI.  Later today it 
is likely I will reconfirm that we are ready to sign the last draft we 
sent.  Subsequently, I will get you a clear statement as to alternative 
language that leaves the Replacement Cost definition less clear ala WSPP. 

Thanks

Tracy,

Did you have a chance to read my email response earlier this week?  I believe 
that it is highly unlikely that we will be able to net exposures across 
non-defaulting (Enron) entities.  Paul Simons can (and maybe has by now) 
given opinion to this idea.  Historically, I believe the opinion has long 
been that such netting (set-off against affiliates of non-defaulting party) 
in the US should work within the case of contractual default, but outside of 
bankruptcy.  However, in the special case of legal bankruptcy, such netting 
(though contractually agreed by the parties) may be challenged.  Introducing 
the fact that one of Enron's entities is a UK entity may further cloud the 
likelihood.  Clearly, if the relationship involves more than on Kaiser 
entity, netting almost certainly will not work.

Has Diana not responded to your credit exposure questions regarding the form 
of governing confirmation and legal entity?  I believe that she is in the US, 
but should be checking in.  Perhaps you should try calling her?  I think we 
will find that the transacting entity is a subsidiary of Kaiser Aluminum.

Risk management systems for metals are still not ideal.  Volumetric/CVAR type 
analysis may not yield such reliable results.   

Rod

Subject: Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corporation - UK and US swaps
Importance: High

Rod,

Enron North America is looking to enter into power swaps with Kaiser Aluminum 
& Chemical Corporation starting June 2001.  I'm seeing in the credit system 
that MG plc has forward financial metals positions with Kaiser, however I 
need clarification on whether the swaps are done with Kaiser Aluminum & 
Chemical Corporation or Kaiser Aluminum International Inc.  Secondly, is 
there a Master ISDA Agreement governing those swaps?  In pulling the mtm 
monthly breakout, it appears that MG plc is OTM north of $10MM US and the 
liquidation of that portfolio occurs mostly in cal '02.

Given Kaiser's limited credit line, I'd like to look into the potential of 
setting off financial exposures in the UK and US in cases of default.  Kaiser 
is looking at other businesses with Enron and this could be quite fruitful to 
tap into in order to increase trading liquidity going forward.

In summary, we need to answer at minimum the following:
? confirmation of which Kaiser entity is financial transacting with MG plc
? volatility of the metal positions that go out to Jan '04 to ensure how 
quickly this out-of-the-money position can move
? what type of paper is confirming the swaps (whether long-form confirms or 
Master ISDA)
? what credit/legal terms and laws may affect our efforts to establish a 
Netting Agreement for UK and US financial

Can you help me in coordinating a meeting with London legal/credit and 
Portland credit/Houston legal to discuss pertinent issues associated with a 
Netting Agreement between Kaiser (single entity or multiple entities) and 
Enron entities (MG plc and ENA) as soon as possible.  Please let me know your 
thoughts to the above and who we need to contact to get the above points 
addressed.  In Houston legal, Carol St. Clair is available to work on the 
drafting of such a Netting Agreement and is speaking with Sara Shackleton 
about the concept as well.

Please let me know as soon as possible your comments to the above and in 
setting up a conference call to push this forward.

Thanks,
Tracy

Carol - I have reviewed the changes in both forms attached.  In the LOC, I 
think that they are getting at the point to allow for partial drawings and 
requesting to reduce the auto renewal notice clause to 30 days from 90 days.  
Seems okay to me.  The proposed changes in the Letter of Credit Provisions, 
please ignore.  I have discussed this with them and they have come off it.

Hi Carol.  Great to hear from you.  I hope all is going well.  

Diana Higgins who is a manager (credit) in the metal area will be the 
principal credit person.  I would say that Kaiser is a low grade credit and 
the contract should be robust with early termination and collateral rights.

Hey Greg.  I see no objection to amending the ISDA to cover power 
transactions.  Also,  potential credit exposure related to a prompt month 
power trade should be modest.  You may want to ensure that Tracy has no 
objection, but this transaction should be fine.

We are looking at doing a June physical index power purchase today with 
Kaiser. however, Kaiser only wants to proceed if we can assure them that we 
can add electricity to the existing ISDA between Enron and Kaiser such that 
they could fix the price during the month of June. After reading your comment 
below about netting it appears that a longer term transaction would not be 
advisable until further legal clarification occurs. Is there any reason we 
can't or shouldn't pursue adding electricity to the ISDA provided we only do 
one month transactions (assuming we see no risk of near term bankrupcty)? 
Please advise immediately.

Carol,

I read the assignment and reviewed our positions with Morgan and Merchant 
Energy Group of America ("MEGA").  Credit is fine with the assignment.  
However, as a result of 
MEGA assigning its trades to Morgan, our mark-to-market exposure to Morgan 
increases by approximately $27.8mm over the next 18 months.  Although we have 
agreed to post margin to each other in the past, our current Master Energy 
Purchase and Sale Agreement with Morgan does not have any STATED provisions 
for margining.  Consequently, we would like to amend the agreement to include 
collateral thresholds for both Enron and Morgan.  I will discuss this issue 
with Ed and get back to you.

Thanks,
Wendy

This Stage 3 Revival and Closing  task is akin to SMUD and I have asked Carol 
St. Clair if she can do it.  I think that is the best chance of getting 
reasonable progress underway on it.  ----cgy

Christian:

One of the things that didn't quite get done prior to Shari Stack's departure 
was the San Diego EEI.  We had gotten it almost to the finish line, but got 
bogged down on a definition of replacement cost.  SDG&E wanted ISO penalties 
to be included in Replacement Costs.  As you know, EPMI's preferred 
definition of CAISO Firm, and regular Firm, excludes penalties.  We ended up 
with an agreement that said we are OK with penalties as long as we are 
notified of incurrence of these penalties within 24 hrs.  This language was 
the last draft we sent to SDG&E and is attached.  

Sharon Firooz called today and wanted to get the EEI back on track.  I 
reiterated the above as where we were when the process got bogged down.  I 
indicated we are ready to sign based on that last draft.  Or we might be 
willing to use an alternative version of CAISO Firm that basically is silent 
ton the definition of Replacement Cost.  

I would like to arrange a time as soon as possible to get you up to speed on 
the issues here so we can get give SDG&E a clear indication of our continued 
willingness to execute the EEI with the language indicated on the draft below 
as well as perhaps an alternative definition of firm that would be silent on 
Replacement Costs.

Thanks

Chris

This will confirm my discussion with Jim T. at Allegheny that deal nos. 
566627 and 586665 are Allegheny Deals as well as all of the financial deals 
that have been done since 3/19 that are booked under Merrill.  If no one has 
any objections and for settlement purposes, I am moving these deals 
immediately to the proper counterparty.  The following deals remain under 
Merrill Lynch

574020
580863
584959
592521
553338
553356
553541

Jim also said that he would be talking to counsel at ML and to Carol about 
how each entity will be trading in the future.  Thanks for your patience.

Here's the revised draft.  I think it includes everything we discussed 
today.  (For the next revision, perhaps we can get all of Select's info 
inserted on the first page, but I've run out of steam just now).  The open 
items are as follows:
(1)  Select to send Ed Sacks an org chart so Ed can verify that the new 5.6 
language about Affiliates is satisfactory.
(2)  Select will discuss with its billing department the possibility of using 
the 5-day payment provision in Enron's amendment to section 6.2 and advise 
Carol St Clair.
(3)  Select and Bob Bruce (along w/ Carol St Clair) to coordinate the EEI 
language in sections 5.2 and 5.4 with the Select/ENA ISDA agreement language 
regarding termination payments.  
(4) When we get very close to execution, Select and Enron will reconcile an 
Attachment A, to include all outstanding transactions between the parties 
other than those that the parties agree should not be covered by the Master 
Agreement (no one could think of any today, but....).

Thanks so much, Phyllis and John and Valerie, for your help in keeping this 
moving (even tho we didn't get to home plate this week, we made lots of 
progress with your help), and I hope our paths will cross again.

Regards,
Janice

Janice - To follow up on this morning's phone call, I propose the following
language:

In the Cover Sheet, Article Five, 5.6 Closeout Setoff, we would check off
Option B, and specify that, for purposes of this section only, Affiliates
of Party B shall only include subsidiaries of Northeast Utilities
Enterprises, Inc.

In the Other Changes section dealing with Confidentiality, I suggest adding
a sentence before the last one in the paragraph, that states:  "For
purposes of this section only, Affiliates of Party B shall not include The
Connecticut Light and Power Company, Western Massachusetts Electric
Company, and Public Service Company of New Hampshire."

I look forward to reviewing the re-draft of the MPPSA.

I have attached a draft of the Credit Annex which has been revised to  
incorporate Carol's comments.  As I mentioned today,  the EEI Master is in 
tact but is supplemented with additional provisions in the Annex.  If you 
prefer to have all provisions relating to collateral in one document, I can 
certainly revise the Master and the Credit Annex accordingly.
I have also attached a version marked to show changes from the Swap Group's 
form of Credit Annex.  Please call with any questions.

Chris, we are leaning more toward the generic language and think that it 
could expedite the approval process.? I have attached the language we propose 
which basically deletes the specific language regarding penalty for 
replacement and sale prices (see section 1.a (1) and (2)in the attached).? I 
wanted to send this to you quickly before you spent a lot of time on the 
other one. THX

Sharon: 

As indicated by my previous e-mail to you, since Shari Stack has left 
Enron, it will take me a couple days to resurrect this EEI.? Later today it 
is likely I will reconfirm that we are ready to sign the last draft we 
sent.? Subsequently, I will get you a clear statement as to alternative 
language that leaves the Replacement Cost definition less clear ala WSPP. 

Thanks

Regarding the L/C format, I was wondering if we can simply take out the auto 
renewal clause in all, given that we value the L/C at $0 once we are within 
20 days from expiry.  Please reply.

I received a voice mail from Kristina Drew this morning indicating they 
received FERC approval of this assignment on 5/31/01.  Are we working on an 
amendment of the contract for Wendy per her email?  When we are ready, 
Kristina indicated that we should print 3 originals of the assignment and 
change the date on it if we have no other changes.  Please let me know status

Rhonda,

Please find attached for your review, a Consent to Assignment Agreement
between us, Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and Morgan Stanley Capital Group
Inc.  We would like to have the document ready to execute at about the same
time we execute the derivatives Consent to Assignment Agreement with Enron
North America, and we are waiting for FERC approval on the Physical Power
Sales as well.  I just wanted to present the agreement to you now, so that
if it is necessary, we have time to discuss any concerns.  I look forward to
talking with you to work toward the execution of the Agreement.

Dear Ms. St. Clair,

In my discussions with Rhonda L Denton, I understand that certain Enron
transactions have been confirmed
as Merrill Lynch Transactions. My understanding of the facts are that
Merrill Lynch has not entered into any
Financial Swaps with Enron North America since  3/16/2001.  Any Financial
transactions after March 16, 2001
should be confirmed as Allegheny Energy as governed by the ISDA Master
Agreement signed on March 16, 2001.

I have confirmed these facts with Ms. Lucy Dorr of ML Client Services;
similarly, Lucy has discussed this matter with
Locke Mc Murray, Counsel to ML Commodities.

The deals in the attached list show ML as the counterparty on Financially
Settled Power Swaps which is incorrect.
Merrill Lynch has entered into Physical Settlement Power transactions which
should be confirmed with ML for
billing purposes.

Allegheny Energy would be happy to supply a letter to Enron to confirm these
facts.
Please feel free to contact me should you need further help in resolving
this matter.


Best Regards,
James M. Tucciarone

Here is a spreadsheet of deals done since 3/19/01, the closing date for the
transfer.  Locke indicated that the deals in yellow are the ones that are
Merrill deals.  The ones in blue were traded the day of the closing and
were supposed to be netted and were not included on the transfer exhibit.
Therefore, they stayed as Merrill in our books.  Please confirm which are
Merrill deals and which are Allegheny.  We will need confirmation after
this review with our attorney as to where these deals will be booked.

Another question that has arisen is whether Allegheny traders are trading
for Merrill Lynch.  These issues need to be resolved so that we do not
continue to have these questions when our settlements people try to check
out at month end.  Thanks for your help.

I left you a telephone message yesterday regarding the following deal:
Enron's physical sale to Merrill Lynch of 200 MWs for delivery on 4/2 at PJM 
(Index)

The Allegheny settlements person is saying it belongs to Allegheny.  You only 
responded regarding the financial deals.  I have attached the spreadsheet 
again and ask that you reply regarding all of the physical deals done after 
3/19.  Our settlements person needs to arrange for payment today if you could 
please reply as soon as possible.

Here's a followup note about Select's concerns on termination issues under 
Article 5 of the EEI.  I did not have time to get to this, but it should help 
wrap up the few outstanding issues on this Master.

Janice - Thanks for turning this around so quickly.  John Morissette has
all the information necessary to fill out the rest of the cover sheet.  I
reviewed the language you proposed for Sections 5.2 and 5.4 to recall what
our issues were and where the inconsistencies lie with the ISDA.

Apparently, in Section 5.2, a series of Transactions might be considered
Excluded Transactions if they can't be terminated under applicable law on
the Early Termination Date, but are used in the calculation of Gains and
Losses once they are terminated.  We don't have any objection to this
language, but in similar language that we proposed for the ISDA  (for a new
proposed Section 6(c)), Enron expressed a concern that this could lead to
"cherry-picking".  I think the way to solve this is to accept your language
for the Master, and limit our language in the ISDA to situations where
transactions can't be terminated immediately under applicable law, but not
due to market issues.  You should run this by Bob Bruce and Carol St. Clair
to see if it helps.

In your new addition to Section 5.4, our concern was with similar language
that had been proposed for Part 5(g)(B) of the ISDA, particularly the words
"all other obligations".  It seemed to me (both in the ISDA and the Master)
that such language could be used to allow the Non-Defaulting party to
withhold payment that may be due to the Defaulting Party, if the Defaulting
Party still owed money or performance to the Non-Defaulting Party.  If this
owing of money or performance is what triggered the Event of Default in the
first place, than the Non-Defaulting Party has created an opportunity where
it never has to make payment to the Defaulting Party.  I don't think this
was the intent.  Bob solved the problem in the ISDA by striking the word
"other" before "obligations" and including the words "(other than those
pursuant to Section 6(e)) after the word "obligations", which works for me.
I suggest that, in the Master, you similarly strike out the word "other"
and insert after "obligations" the words "(other than those pursuant to
Section 5.3)".  Let me know if this is acceptable.

[I'll see you at approx. 1  p.m. today right?] 

Re the below, contact the credit group to see if they can speedily resolve 
the credit issues so as to bring the EEI to bear on the transansaction, 
clearly the best result.  Credit will also indicate whether the size of the 
trade is such that they want to insist the trade is done under a completed 
EEI Master, rather than being documented the 'old way' and then brought under 
the EEI Master upon its completion.  If the trade will be completed under the 
Tariff, you'll want to look at the Tariff to see what underlying terms you're 
dealing with (e.g., 1 year limit on term of trade completed under the Tariff, 
availability of LDs for a trade involving LD energy, etc.)

If not already known to you, Genia or Elizabeth may have input on where 
things stood in Janice's negotiations with CP&L.

CP&L has marked up a confirm that we sent to them for a deal that was done 
5/8/2001 to make it subject to their 5/18/98 Tariff agreement.  We are in the 
process of negotiating an EEI Master with them but have some outstanding 
credit issues.  How should I respond to their mark-up?  This was one of

Kendal:
This is my last day at Enron, so I apologize for not getting back to you 
earlier this week to try to wrap up the CP&L EEI master -- there were many 
loose ends I had to tie up and I've run out of time.  So Carol St Clair 
(another lawyer in our group) will be pursuing the EEI master with you, with 
Genia Fitzgerald's help.

As for NC Power HOldings -- there is no EEI Master  for the daily call option 
transaction, and there won't be one.  We decided to pursue this transaction 
as a one-off deal on our "long-form" confirm b/c the credit terms we would 
have required of CP&L for an EEI Master were troubling to CP&L and would have 
delayed the transaction beyond the point that the parties found tolerable.  
Now, of course, CP&L has worked through some of those issues, but at the 
time, we just decided to use another approach.

Hope this answers your question.  It was a pleasure working with you and I 
hope our paths will cross again.
Regards,
Janice

afternoon and all day on Friday.  Let me know if either of those times work

-Now the reason for this e-mail (I can't get a hold of the people internally

determine to just not execute an EEI?

I attach a draft dated 5/10/01 of a Two Way Cash and Letter of Credit Form of 
Credit Support Annex to be used with EEI Masters.  Because the Draft Annex is 
based on the form  used by the Swap Group, I have also attached a version 
marked to show changes from the Swap Group's form.

While preparing this I also reviewed the Credit Annex draft prepared by 
Morgan Stanley and Shari Stack's comments on it.  Unlike the MS draft, mine 
doesn't contemplate any kinds of collateral other than cash and letters of 
credit (which is what EAS wanted, I believe.)  In addition, Shari had posed 
the question of whether any defaults under the Credit Annex itself should be 
made Events of Default under the Master Agreement.  Although my initial 
reaction is that we should not add any such additional defaults under the 
Credit Annex as Events of Default, please think about this question as you 
review the draft.

I look forward to your comments.

Carol,

Please review message below from Kristina Drew @ Merchant Energy.  I thought 
you would be the appropriate lawyer to work on this as it involves EPMI as 
well as a derivative piece with ENA.

FYI:  the assignment is not of immediate need, being that FERC approval must 
secured.

If you do not think this to be the case, please advise as to who should work 
on this matter.

Janice - To follow up on this morning's phone call, I propose the following
language:

In the Cover Sheet, Article Five, 5.6 Closeout Setoff, we would check off
Option B, and specify that, for purposes of this section only, Affiliates
of Party B shall only include subsidiaries of Northeast Utilities
Enterprises, Inc.

In the Other Changes section dealing with Confidentiality, I suggest adding
a sentence before the last one in the paragraph, that states:  "For
purposes of this section only, Affiliates of Party B shall not include The
Connecticut Light and Power Company, Western Massachusetts Electric
Company, and Public Service Company of New Hampshire."

I look forward to reviewing the re-draft of the MPPSA.

Rhonda,

Please find attached for your review, a Consent to Assignment Agreement
between us, Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and Morgan Stanley Capital Group
Inc.  We would like to have the document ready to execute at about the same
time we execute the derivatives Consent to Assignment Agreement with Enron
North America, and we are waiting for FERC approval on the Physical Power
Sales as well.  I just wanted to present the agreement to you now, so that
if it is necessary, we have time to discuss any concerns.  I look forward to
talking with you to work toward the execution of the Agreement.

Not that I know of.  Christian is assigned the EEI Agreement in the database 
but we have never received credit terms.  We have a Master Energy with MEGA 
dated 4/01/98.  Will you be handling and if so, do you need a copy of the 
Agreement?

Carol,

Please review message below from Kristina Drew @ Merchant Energy.  I thought 
you would be the appropriate lawyer to work on this as it involves EPMI as 
well as a derivative piece with ENA.

FYI:  the assignment is not of immediate need, being that FERC approval must 
secured.

If you do not think this to be the case, please advise as to who should work 
on this matter.


Cordially,
