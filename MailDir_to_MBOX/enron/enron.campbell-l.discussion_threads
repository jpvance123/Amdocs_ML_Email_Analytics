Lou,
I would like to "confidentially" discuss the issues Larry has raised with you 
and see where the Legal Department may or may not want to proceed with these 
issues.  Thanks, John Shafer

Subject: Compliance with the Large Quantity Generator Requirements, 
Transwestern Pipeline Company

A review was completed of the storage tank requirements for  large quantity 
generators of hazardous waste.  These regulations apply to almost each 
mainline C/S in New Mexico,  Arizona and California (initiating at Station 9, 
Roswell to Needles and including the tanks on the Topock Lateral).  There are 
eighteen condensate tanks on the Transwestern mainline system which could 
potentially be impacted, however, only about 10 tanks have received hazardous 
waste liquids in the last 3-4 years.   The constituents which make these 
tanks fall under Subtitle C of RCRA  is the arsenic, lead and low flashpoint 
(VOC's) of the condensate.   PCB's are another issue and are subject to other 
requirements. 

Briefly, the liquids which collect into the tanks is highly variable in 
quantity, contaminant concentration and with respect to when condensate 
enters the tanks.  When the gas is extremely dry, no condensate is 
collected.  During periods of wet gas movement, condensate with arsenic, lead 
and low flashpoint is collected.  In the 1980's to mid 90's, all eighteen 
tanks collected sufficient condensate with arsenic, lead, flashpoint and 
PCB's that the contensate in the tanks was hauled away every 90 days.   From 
1995 up to 1999, the system was essentially dry and no liquids were 
collected.  The tanks did not fall under the hazardous waste requirements.  
However, this year, we are seeing more liquids hauled away as hazardous waste 
than we have seen in the past 4-5 years. 

I would like to discuss the issue of compliance with these tanks.  The 
consistency and volume of regulated  liquids which are now being collected at 
the C/S tanks warrants a discussion.   The El Paso incident may be a driving 
force in this issue.....

I would like to pay the NYISO to conduct a study for me on the price impact
of the transmission outages planned each day.  Since I would be paying for
this, I wouldof course be entitled to get the results one day in advance of
all other market participants.  The ISO would of course be free to release
the results to the rest of the marketplace just following the release of
the day ahead results each day.  This would ultimately be in the best
interests of the marketplace since I would immediately arbitrage the daily
market to the correct prices and thereby increase efficiency.  Upon review,
all would be amazed at just how efficient the marketplace has become based
upon how accurate it was at predicting settlement prices.

If I read Mr. Palazzo's message correctly, the ISO is acting as a paid

Now I am starting to share some of Roy's discomfort.

Not only does this call into question the objectivity of such contracted
studies, it also offers some insight into the inability for non-paying
participants to get their technical issues addressed by the ISO.

As a separate item to the concerns I had about the technical content, I was
a little confused on what was done here administratively. The last
paragraph
says something about NYPA sharing the study. I didn't think they had
anything at all to say about it in the first place if it is an ISO work
product. If they do, could you explain why this is the case? If the ISO did
this, why wasn't this all posted on the OASIS at the same time NYPA got
this? The date on this shows a March 26 release.  Ignore these comments if
this was done, but I wasn't aware of this.

I am more than a little uncomfortable with a single market participant
having a month's lead time on ISO studies that can have significant
commercial impact. Think about the implications of this in the context of
people negotiating long term bi lateral ICAP agreements over the last
month.
Depending on your take on the type of market changes that this type of
analysis might support, there could be enormous changes to the economics of
seasonal versus annual agreements, choice of equipment etc. This simply
isn't fair. Even if posted, this type of work by the ISO that can have
large
potential commercial impacts should go out on all of the distributions at
the same time as release to anyone and OASIS posting.

Subject: NYPA study-Winter Locational ICAP requirements

At NYPA's request ISO staff conducted a limited analysis of
the winter locational ICAP requirements for Long Island and New York City
areas.  While such ICAP requirements have historically been set as a single
number for the entire year, it is NYPA's belief that this holdover from the
old way of doing business must be re-examined.  It is NYPA's belief that
most if not all of the contribution to loss of load risk occurs in the
summer months.  As such, some reduction in winter ICAP requirements should
be possible with no impact on the Loss of Load criterion of one day in ten
years.

NYPA requested that the ISO start with the database that
resulted in the locational requirements of 80% and 98% for New York City
and
Long Island, respectively.   At NYPA's request the ISO modeled winter
ratings on the transmission interfaces into NYC and LI and determined how
much the 80% and 98% could be reduced in the winter before any impact on
the
statewide Loss Of Load  occurred.  The report indicates that winter
requirements of 75% and 92% of the summer peak load resulted for NYC and
LI,
respectively.

While this in no way reflects an exhaustive analysis of winter
locational requirements, the results from this study suggest that some
reduction in the winter         requirement may be warranted and a
consideration of seasonal requirements should be incorporated in future
ICAP
requirement studies.   NYPA believes that       having an ICAP requirement
for summer and winter seasons based on the LSE's peak load for the
respective season would send the proper ICAP price signal.


NYPA is sharing the study results in the attached report in
an effort to begin a dialog which we hope will lead to a broader
examination
of locational requirements when the issue is revisited again next year.  We
would appreciate hearing the views of other market participants.

I dont know if you guys are doing this, but a requirement to your air permit 
states that the facility is to report the number of hours of operation each 
year to the Air Quality Bureau for the Catepillar generator.  The report is 
to be submitted by January 31st of each year.  If we need to discuss this,

My house is finally ready for its first party!  Please join me for some 
cocktails, finger foods, music, and overall good spirits!

It's going to be Saturday, May 19 starting anytime after 6:00PM until Sunday 
7:30AM.  (That's when I go to church.)  May 19 is not this weekend.  It's 
next weekend.

I'll have a mix a domestic beers (including light), with some hard liquor, 
soft drinks, vegetable tray, and munchies.  (Feel free to bring any 
'specialized' booze that you may desire.)  Join in me in the fun!  Bring a 
friend.

Please RSVP so I can get an idea of how of you rapscallions will show up.  
Email me or call me at the phone numbers at the bottom.

I wanted to let everyone know that the meeting between Southwest Gas and 
SoCal concerning presence of PCBs on the Southwest Gas system will be this 
tuesday.  I had an opportunity to speak with Ralph Komai today during the PCB 
quarterly management conference call  that Transwestern has with SoCal to 
discuss PCB related invoices.  As a brief summary, Southwest has had isolated 
hits of PCB in liquids (232 and 132 ppm) and in wipe tests (10-100 ug/wipe)  
in regulators on their system and they have asked Ralph if he would assist 
them in the management and disposal of PCBs on their system.  He wil also be 
providing thoughts on how and why PCBs move in a gas pipeline.

I had asked Ralph not to mention about Transwestern's agreement with SoCal 
for which Transwestern pays SoCal for 86% of their PCB costs.  I had asked 
him to only focus on the Southwest system.  Apparently Southwest is not up to 
speed with the PCB regualtions, however, enough so that they do realize that 
the mega rule will impact their operations and Ralph will probably provide 
input for that as well from an LDC standpoint. 

I asked Ralph whether Southwest seemed excited or worried about the PCB 
discovery on their system and he indicated that they were more concerned 
about compliance with the PCB regulations.  Ralph said he will let me know 
the results of the meeting.

A meeting was held with the Roswell Team at C/S No 8 discuss roles and 
responsibilities of the Title V Operating Permit for the Corona C/S.

The sale of the TW Crawford C/S has been cancelled.  A permit revision was 
requested to the Air Quality Bureau to transfer the new permit to the 
existing facility to keep intact the ability to conduct turbine power unit 
replacements without agency notification.

Preparations are in place for the forthcoming meeting between PG&E and 
Transwestern over PCB issues on their mainline.  Analytical shows that the 
PCB's are continuing to move further downstream into their system.  Ralph 
Komai, with SoCal, will make a presentation concerning  SoCal's experience 
with PCBs on mainline and LDC systems and present it during the 4/20 meeting 
in San Francisco.

The annual certification for the Atoka No. 3 C/S was reveiwed for completion 
and submitted to M. Nelson for signature.

Attached for your reference is a copy of the meeting notes taken on July 13, 
2000 during a meeting with PG&E at TW's Flagstaff Compressor Station.  One of 
the critical issues that came out of this effort was finding out from PG&E 
that they need TW's deliveries to blend into the richer gas that they are 
receiving from El Paso and Kern River so they can meet their air permit 
emission limits on VOC's.  If they do not have TW's deliveries (dry gas) for 
the blending they will not be able to maintain compliance in some 
non-attainment areas.  John Shafer

In addition to adjustments to billing units due to the receipt of billing
quality
metering data, this settlement adjustment includes the following billing code
modifications/corrections:

   Billing code was modified to model scheduling & dispatch of grouped
   generators
   for settlement of energy & bid production cost guarantee payments.
   Generators
   affected by this modification should see proper payment of those 
quantities.
   Any
   costs incurred by the NYISO will be recovered from transmission customers
   through
   their OATT Schedule 1 residual & BPCG adjustments
   For the December settlement adjustment, billing code was modified to ensure
   that
   appropriate prices corrections resulting from ECA-B were captured in the
   billing.
   This may impact transmission customers whose transactions were subject to
   ECA-B
   treatment, resulting in transmission usage charge adjustments.  Any costs
   incurred
   by the NYISO will be recovered from transmission customers through their 
OATT
   Schedule 1 residual adjustment.
   For the December settlement adjustment, a number of grandfathered rights &
   TCC
   configurations were corrected.  Customers affected by this would see either
   their
   TCC's converted back to grandfathered rights, or vice versa.  Any excess or
   deficiency
   in cost recovery will be balanced with the Transmission Owners, based upon
   their
   respective megawatt-mile coefficients.
   There was a code modification to allow for Class 2 PURPA generators to sell
   all
   over-generation to the real-time market.  This would result in payment to
   those
   affected suppliers.    Any costs incurred by the NYISO will be recovered 
from
   transmission customers through their OATT Schedule 1 residual adjustment.

Larry,

Attached is the latest version of the Red Rock Mainline Expansion
environmental report.  This should be fairly complete except for a few
pieces of information.  I have listed things I still need below.

Information Needed...
1. Dates of air permit submittals and copies of applications
2. Copies of T&E phone logs and/or written responses
3. Copy of USFS notification and/or phone log
4. Dates of cultural resource surveys, findings (verbal), date when
reports will be ready, copies of any agency responses and/or phone logs
5. Manufacture/model of new units (if different from those given to
air/noise consultants, updates will be needed)
6. Verify whether we need volume of hydro-test water

FYI Donna sent me the new plot plans via e-mail.  I took a look at those and
updated the report accordingly.  I have not heard anything regarding the
soils from the Forest Service.  Minimum checklist requirements only ask for
NRCS mapped soil data.  Scott Patti in our Ft. Collins office happened to be
speaking with one of his FERC contacts on another project and asked about
the issue of no mapped soils.  His contact indicated to him that it would
not be a problem for work within existing facilities.

I will be working remotely tomorrow, but will have access to e-mail and can
be contacted via my cell phone 919-632-6840.  Otherwise, leave me a message
and I will call you to discuss.
Hope all went well with the EPA,

Terry.

Gents -  I say we go with it and present what we think is appropriate in 
Frisco and see what else they want.  There is something we filed with the EPA 
back in 1994 (I have a complete copy) and there is not a great deal of 
information after that since we have been dry.  

Larry & Butch - since we have to pull the info what do you think????

Dave - I think we are very close since what we had in mind was to bring a bit 
of material with us to San Francisco and see what else would make sense to 
provide.  Let me run the traps and I should be able to get back to you first 
thing.  Thanks!

Lou --

We are close.  Here is a suggestion or two.  My suggestion in "green."

Can we finalize today?

Thank you for your help.

NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

I won't repeat everything that Mark said. I agree with all of it. I
publically stated several times that it would be appropriate for parties to
consider these plus other risk elements in formulating bidding strategies
for upcoming ICAP.

However, it also appears that Steven has forgotten a major and fundamental
change in the ICAP markets. This is surprising as he characterizes ICAP as a
call on the resource. When ICAP was offered for last summer there was no
energy price cap, or effectively the price cap was $10,000, today it is
$1,000. This means that in the context of his analogy a call was offered
last summer with a strike price of $10,000 versus $1,000 today. An order of
magnitude change in strike price for the seller of a call seems pretty major
to me, particularly when coupled with all of the other new risk factors and
general "tightening" of supply versus demand.

"Stephen Fernands" <srfernands@cesolution.com> writes to the
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Mark,
Thank you for your thoughtful response.  I think you raise some valid
points, but I do not think they change the end conclusion.

Fundamental Value of ICAP
The principle of the ICAP market, as in any market, should be to reflect the
value of the underlying product that is being sold to the market.  The
question is whether the product being sold, in this case ICAP, has truly
appreciated more then 400% since the previous ICAP auctions.  Maybe - but I
doubt it.

AMP and Expected Revenue
The premise that changing the existing market mitigation rules to catch rule
breaking on a real time basis instead of a one day lag basis, although
plausible, seems fairly weak.  It presumes that generation owners were
planning on violating the pre-existing screens and counting on the revenue
from those "golden eggs."  Likewise, the link between "expected energy
revenue" and ICAP prices is tenuous at best.  Generators are not limited to
receiving revenue from the spot market and may well choose to sell energy in
the bilateral market.  In either case the goal of the generation owner is to
maximize revenue through all markets.  The ICAP market, if functioning
properly, should reflect the value of the first call on the energy from the
generator by the NYISO and the ability of the NYISO to curtail external
transactions from that generator.  For example two generation owners owned
two plants with the same characteristics. One generation owner did a
relatively "good" job selling a forward energy contract for the 6 month
procurement period while the other owner did a relatively "poor" job selling
a similar contract.  In the ICAP auctions they both should have the same
strategy - maximize the revenue that each of them can receive out of the
ICAP auction.  Any other strategy by either of the plants will lead to
overall lower profits.

Price Cap Load Bidding (I won't comment on if Virtual Bidding were in place
because it isn't going to be)
Price Cap Load Bidding has been available in the past, only know it is
expanded slightly to Zonal Price Cap Load Bidding.  This is not a
significant change to the existing rules and would seem unlikely to account
for either a significant change in the expected energy revenue or the
underlying value of the ICAP product.

"...significant uncertainty to the New York market..."
I would agree that all of the rule changes including the Penalty and Public
Disclosure Proposal  made it difficult for generation owners to properly
evaluate the effects of selling ICAP into a 6 month market.  For this
reason, as well as the other possible reasons listed on my letter, I believe
that mitigating measures should be evaluated.  I am not passing judgment at
this stage, but feel that all parties should know that the prices that were
posted are in the process of being reviewed and that subsequent changes may
be required to some or all of the months.

Next Steps
If the MMU determines that there was economic and/ or physical withholding,
whether due to regulatory uncertainty in surrounding control areas or
internal uncertainty about the exact effects of the AMP, I believe that it
is most appropriate for the MMU to take immediate action and refer it to the
committees for longer term resolution.

Tim, please help me out with the coding.  Max, as for where we stand on this 
project.  This billing includes the surveys, literature reviews, and 
consultations with archeology (SHPO) and fish and wildlife.  Data bases have 
been researched and complete.  It also includes consultations with Cycla 
Corporation (contractor for the OPS) on the presentation of the EA.  METRIC 
still needs to talk to you about some of the technical issues that have been 
proposed for this project.  I would suspect that they are about 25% 
complete.  I told them to put the project "on hold"  untill they discussed 
the scope with you so as not to bring additional costs into the project  in 
the event that the project is cancelled.  METRIC's number is 505-828-2801.  
If the decision is made to continue, they want to spend some time on the 
phone with you, discussing the technical issues to more completely understand 
the scope.

Plz get with Tim Jones.  He knows the coding string for the TW Demo project.
I hope to know within the next few weeks whether we're on or off with being 
in the program.  

Approx. what % completion is Metric with this work?  How long do they 
estimate to complete if I get back with them to do so?

Thanks - Max

Max, I have an invoice from METRIC Corporation on 7/18/00 for the work they 
have done on the above referenced project of yours.  The amount is 
$6,765.39.  I'd like to either send this to you or have you provide me with 
the coding and w.o. number and I'll do it myself.  I would appreciate it if 
you would give me some direction and let me know what you want me to do.

I spoke with Ken Jacobs, with the Forest Service in Flagstaff, concerning his 
agencies approval for the turbine construction at Station 2.  As a condition 
of the approval from his agency, he has requested that all the ponderosa pine 
trees to be removed for the turbine construction activities be flagged for 
identification.  After the trees have been marked, we are to then contact him 
so that he can visit the site and make an evaluation as to whether the Forest 
Service will charge us for the tree removal or whether no additional charges 
will be incurred as a result of the construction activity.  The charges will 
depend upon the calculation of how many board feet of lumber there are in the 
trees which are flagged.

As this activity is included in the time line for completion of all permits 
and approvals, please contact me when the trees have been tagged and flagged 
and I will contact Ken Jacobs so that he can make a site visit.

This is a short note to apprise those that the before and after emissions 
testing for the fuel valves and carbuerator at  the Spraberry C/S has been 
submitted to 
t he TNRCC.   The data showed fuel savings, as we had hoped it would and we 
also received an emissions reduction benefit.  According to the agency, this 
replacement activity will not require an amendment to the permit, which will 
be a plus for the company.  

My compliments to all involved for the retesting and efforts it took to make 
this happen.  I will forward the response from the TNRCC as it is received.

   Enron/TransCanada -2: Analyst Calls Deal 'Unlikely'

   Dow Jones Energy Service - 08/26/1999

   (Copyright (c) 1999, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

   HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp. isn't pursuing a purchase of TransCanada 
Pipelines Ltd., a
   spokesman for Enron said Thursday. 

   "There's absolutely no truth to the rumor that Enron wants to buy 
TransCanada," Mark Palmer, a
   spokesman for Enron, told Dow Jones Newswires. 

   TransCanada operates a natural gas pipeline that runs from Alberta to 
eastern Canada. It also
   operates the Nova Gas system, an intraprovincial gas gathering and 
transportation pipeline in
   Alberta. 

   Ordinarily Enron could not comment on rumors about a possible acquisition 
because of Securities
   and Exchange Commission rules, Palmer said. But the company can comment if 
such rumors are
   having an effect on the stock price, he added. The rumor has circulated 
since last month. 

   Raymond Niles, an analyst who follows Enron for Schroders&Co. Inc, put out 
a report Thursday
   morning attributing "recent (Enron) stock price weakness" to the rumor. 

   Niles' report said it would be "highly unlikely" that Enron would buy 
TransCanada. 

   Enron's gas pipeline business accounts for less that 15% of the company's 
total earnings, Niles
   said. Enron's management has said in the past that it doesn't "need to own 
its existing pipeline
   system to grow its core energy marketing business." 

   In the last two years, he said, Enron has moved to reduce its interest in 
non-core businesses such as
   gas pipelines. 

   Enron is also minimizing its investments in hard assets, Niles said in his 
report. The company has
   made investments in strategically located power generating assets, but 
"it's plan is to keep capital
   investments to a minimum ... and monetize existing assets."

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=
he=20
crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=
 will=20
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20
solutions to the state.

Larry, per our phone conversation tonight.  I found this article interesting, 
especially in light of potential future expansions on TW.  Note the section 
below in bold Red text.  Camp Navajo is nearly due South of Station 2 just 
across Interstate 40 and as you know, Kachina Village is South of Flagstaff 
off Interstate 15.  This may or may not pose any direct threats to TW ROW's 
but, it does give us a flavor of public sentiment with regards to conserving 
these areas.....   Anyhow, fyi...  (Oh yea, The Grand Canyon Trust & The 
Nature Conservancy in Flagstaff share the same office building)  



New land pegged for preservation


By ANNE MINARD
Sun Staff Reporter
07/29/2001

Reader Comments

It's been less than a year since Arizona voters narrowly
rejected Proposition 100, a plan to protect 290,000
acres of State Trust Land from development.
And in about a month, voters could be asked to begin
signing petitions to get another initiative on the
ballot that would protect significantly more of the
state's legacy -- 1 million acres, or about 10 percent,
including thousands of acres in and around Flagstaff.

The difference, conservationists say, is that this land
has been chosen with the goal of protecting biologically
and aesthetically important areas. The environmental
community rallied against Prop. 100 because they said
the lands chosen for protection were insufficient and
had little value for conservation.

For example, the Proposition 100 campaign identified 10
acres of Rio De Flag in east Flagstaff -- near a
wastewater treatment plant outflow -- as one of the
state's "crown jewels" needing to be preserved.

Two other parcels in the Flagstaff area included 15
acres on Wildcat Hill with an unimpressive view of an
industrial park and 269 acres of steep slopes littered
with shot-up refrigerators and television sets called
Turkey Hills.

Rogers Lake, an important wetland and major ecosystem
south of Flagstaff, was also slated for preservation
under Prop 100. But that plan only included its soggy
lakebed, while 2,000 acres of highly developable
shoreline owned by the State Trust Land Department was
still up for grabs.

THE NEW PLAN

The new initiative would include all areas around Rogers
Lake, excluding those that are private or held by the
U.S. Forest Service. One proposed parcel does still fall
in the Turkey Hills area, and three others lie between
Flagstaff proper and Walnut Canyon (not included is
Section 20, which is likely to be sold and developed,
but at densities that are still in dispute between the
county and the city).

Other areas would include parcels around Observatory
Mesa (a contiguous chunk of land south and west of the
Naval Observatory) and a checkerboard pattern of
sections -- interspersed with Forest Service land --
south of Camp Navajo and west of Kachina Village and
Griffiths Spring.

Like Prop. 100, an initiative would be only a first
step. If it were to appear on the ballot and then pass,
it would take an act of Congress, and a constitutional
amendment, to change the availability of State Trust
Lands.

State Trust Lands include about 135 million acres across
the country -- 9.3 million in Arizona -- originally
allocated by the federal government when each state was
formed to help fund public schools. (See related story
on Page A11.)

Brad Ack, program director for the Flagstaff-based Grand
Canyon Trust who is helping spearhead the initiative,
said the state's schools shouldn't be bought and paid
for with proceeds from unmanaged sprawl. Areas set aside
under the initiative could still be leased for grazing,
agriculture or other current uses -- but they would
never be sold for commercial development.

Making an informed decision to set aside designated
State Trust Lands will free others from the battles that
now accompany proposals to develop them, he said.

The initiative is a collaborative effort between the
Grand Canyon Trust and other conservation groups, along
with some business and development affiliates.

And supporters are touting a recent poll conducted by
the Grand Canyon Trust, the Sonoran Institute in Tucson
and the Nature Conservancy that showed 88 percent of
Arizona voters agreed that some of Arizona's State Trust
Land should be conserved.

TALKING COMPENSATION

But members of the State Department of Lands charged
with managing the tracts -- and a lobbyist for
superintendents and principals in the state's school
system -- say the initiative backers are missing the
mark in the state land debate.

"We have a fundamental difference of opinion with our
friends in the environmental community," said Mike
Smith, a contract lobbyist for the Arizona School
Administrator Association. "Preserve, set aside ... we
think those are great ideas. The question is
compensation. Those State Trust Lands are in trust for
the schools. It's acutely important for schools to
maximize the returns on state lands."

Smith acknowledged that the awareness of their legacy is
new for the state's schools. Until recently, the schools
didn't see a whole lot of benefit from the state trusts.

"We haven't seen any of it. The state Legislature has
taken the annual earnings, and has used it to reduce
state aid coming out of the general fund."

That all changed with the passage of Proposition 301,
passed last year, he said.

"In addition to increasing sales tax for the schools ...
they also said, 'By the way, all new earnings from the
state trust fund go into the school site fund.' All of a
sudden, it's real different for us. Before it supplanted
our funding, now it will supplement it. It's real money
to us."

The Legislature will still keep the money it has been
earning from State Trust Lands -- about $80 million a
year. But anything above that mark will now go to the
schools, and both Smith and Nick Simonetta, manager of
communications and legislative affairs for the Arizona
Department of Lands, are optimistic that figure will
climb rapidly in the coming years. Simonetta estimates
the schools could see $650 million in addition to
legislative appropriations over the next decade.

LOOKING BACK

But the past irregularities are a stronghold for
conservationists who are promoting the land reform
initiative.

In background literature for its State Trust Land Reform
Initiative, the Grand Canyon Trust says that the State
Trust Lands haven't been used as they were intended
anyway, and very little money has gone to Arizona
schools.

"State Trust Lands currently provide less than 2 percent
of the annual funding for public education," the
document reads. "... there is little, if any, direct
benefit from State Trust Lands to our public schools."

Simonetta said he strongly disagrees with that
assessment.

"I think those statements are severely misleading and
not reflective of what is currently the case. You can
throw around percentages any way you want. If you look
at what the trust has been contributing to the school
construction budget, it's more like 30 or 40 percent."

Regardless, Simonetta and Smith agree that the future of
State Trust Land will rest on its ability to generate
funds -- and won't be given away for free.

"It comes down to this: We are in intense discussion
with the conservation community," Smith said. "Our
conversations are all around the question of
compensation. We are not going to support any initiative
that contemplates setting aside State Trust Land without
compensation. You can take that non-support as far as
you like. If they attempt to go to Congress, we are
going with them."

This is a gentle reminder, and Im sure that most are aware, but under no 
circumstances is there to be any construction activiy initiated for the 
turbine installation at the four mainline compressor stations, until the air 
construction permits are issued by the applicable air agency.  Construction 
activity is defined, but is not limited to roads, trenching activity, 
buildings, electrical poles etc.  The state and federal agencies take a very 
dim view on initiating any attempts to initiate construction prior to 
approval.  This approval is considered to be the air permit authorizing 
construction of the proposed activity.  Your assistance in this compliance 
issue will be greatly apprecaited.   Data generation and agency consultations 
are now in progress to expidite the permit submittals.  Should you need 
further clarification, give me a call (505) 625-8022 or via e-mail.

This year has been a year of change for Enron and GPG: Enron=01,s stock spl=
it,=20
we implemented a Continuous Improvement program, and we underwent a major=
=20
reorganization.  These changes have all had a positive impact on our compan=
y,=20
increasing our competitive advantage in the marketplace and challenging a=
=20
well performing organization to perform at an even higher level.  All of th=
is=20
translates to raising the bar for increased performance. =20

As GPG begins its annual year-end process of appraising performance and=20
allocating variable pay and merit increases, there are a number of changes =
to=20
the process I would like to communicate.  These changes will impact all GPG=
=20
employees, except those of you receiving Skill Based Pay.  These changes wi=
ll=20
help us take a more focused look at individual and overall company=20
performance and are intended to ensure consistency and equity in the proces=
s=20
across GPG.  The following details these changes:

Vice Presidents and Higher
All employees with the title of vice president or higher will be reviewed=
=20
Enron-wide, using common performance criteria and performance ratings.  The=
=20
officers will be reviewed and ranked within peer groups.  These groups are=
=20
Commercial, Commercial Support, Commercial Support Specialist and Technical=
.=20

All Other Non-Skill Based Pay Employees
All other non-Skill Based Pay employees will be evaluated using the current=
=20
GPG performance criteria and performance levels within their respective=20
company or business unit.  This will not be an Enron-wide activity.   =20

For directors or director-equivalent employees there will be an additional=
=20
step, which will be a GPG-wide cross-calibration by the GPG Management=20
Committee in early December.=20

We are taking a more focused look at performance.  In our efforts to=20
challenge a well-performing organization to achieve an even higher level of=
=20
performance, we are establishing the following distribution as a guideline:

Level 1 - Consistently Exceeds Expectations  10%
Level 2 - Often Exceeds Expectations  30%
Level 3 - Meets Expectations   50%
Level 4 - Needs Improvement and
Level 5 - Seldom Meets Expectations  10%=20

In the case of non-Skill Based Pay team employees in Operations, this proce=
ss=20
will lead to two ratings: a team rating, which will determine the level of=
=20
variable pay, and an individual rating that will be used to determine merit=
=20
increases.

This represents a change in our performance management process.  GPG is the=
=20
premier natural gas transmission company because of our ability to accept a=
nd=20
demand change.  We were one of the first companies to implement a Skill Bas=
ed=20
Pay Program and self-directed work teams.  We implemented Best Practices an=
d=20
Continuous Improvement.   This new approach to performance management is an=
=20
effort to strive for the top level of performance in our industry.   I want=
=20
to be clear that we have raised our performance expectations for the compan=
y=20
as well as for individuals.=20

Variable pay and merit increases will be impacted by these changes as well.=
 =20
GPG will use market data, job grade and individual and company performance =
to=20
set target bonus payout levels.  Payouts will reflect performance.  Divisio=
n=20
heads will no longer receive a pool of dollars to allocate to their=20
employees.  This method will eliminate significant differences in variable=
=20
pay for similar positions, job levels and performance levels across the=20
organization. =20

Merit increases will continue to be determined as they were in the past. =
=20
Each business unit will have a pool of dollars, which is funded as a percen=
t=20
of payroll.  Merit increases will be based on a variety of factors includin=
g=20
individual performance. =20

Variable pay will be distributed in early February and merit increases are=
=20
effective Feb. 1, 2000.

To continue to be a leading energy transportation company in a highly=20
competitive market, it is imperative that we continue to strive for=20
excellence in all we do.  I appreciate your continued support as we go=20
through this change, as you have accepted and supported other changes we ha=
ve=20
undergone.  Please do not hesitate to call your supervisor or your Human=20
Resources Representative if you have any questions.

The TNRCC Sunset legislation,  including the grandfather provisions, has been 
sent to the Governor and will likely be signed. I am providing a quick 
summary of this bill since you may be discussing it next week in Houston. I 
will be attending a TXOGA pipeline committee meeting on June 5 where it will 
be discussed in detail, and will provide more information after that meeting.

The Bill divides the state into two regions. East Texas is all counties east 
of I-35 (north of San Antonio) and north of I-37 (south of San Antonio) that 
transverse these highways. This region includes Nueces County. West Texas is 
the rest of the state.

In East Texas, you must apply for a permit for grandfathered emission sources 
by September 1, 2003 and comply with the permit by March 1, 2007. In West 
Texas you must apply by September 1, 2004 and comply with the permit by March 
1, 2008. The control requirements in the permit, except for pipeline 
reciprocating engines, will be based on 10-year old BACT.

There are specific provisions for pipeline reciprocating engines. In East 
Texas, 50% reductions of NOx and VOC will be required. In West Texas, 0% to 
20% reductions of NOx and VOC will be required. You will have the flexibility 
to attain these reductions on a per engine basis or can average over multiple 
engines. A $16.2 million fund has been established by Reliant to partially 
finance the cost of compliance with the pipeline engine requirements in East 
Texas.

As you are aware, the cost impact of this legislation can be greatly reduced 
by "authorizing" as many grandfathered emission sources as possible under old 
standard exemptions as per the October 3, 2000 letter from TNRCC. Most 
grandfathered engines, tanks, dehys etc. can be authorized via old 
exemptions. Previously TNRCC indicated verbally that this method of 
authorizing grandfathered sources would be available until September 1, 2001, 
but TNRCC can change this date (move it up or move it back).

Subject: TW Comments to air permits for Stat3 and 4


Jon and Ruth, presented below are the comments to the air perimts at 3 and
4.  Please review for clairty and content.  I have spoken to Roger Kohn
about all of these issues and the only one which may be a problem is with
No. 2.  He is checking on what the EPA can do about this.  I have spoken to
Arnold Eisenstein about what we can do with the strict 25 ppmvd requriement
for NOx and CO and he has said that we can hold to the 25 ppm value by
doing some major gas recycling.  This is a fuel waste and costly.  Anyway,
depending upon how long this issue delays the issuance of the permit will
undoubtably determine whether we give in to the 25 ppmvd or hold out for 40
ppmvd.  Id like your comments asap.


              1.     The responsible official name change to  Danny
Pribble.

                         2..  The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions
to 25 ppmv at 15% O2, based on a 3-hour average, except during periods of
startup        and shutdown.  At 60F and above the GE data indicates that
these rates are achievable under all operating conditions.  However, GE
     data indicates that NOx and CO may be as high as 40 ppmv during
low-load conditions of 60%and lower.

           The permit application represented turbine operations at base
        load 80% of the time with reduced load operations (64% load)
        occurring    no more than 20% of the time.  The potential to emit
        calculations presented the emissions in the application in units of
        lb.hr and ton/yr.      These values were accepted by the EPA for
        the netting analysis, and  took were taken into account by the EPA
        (See EPA Statement     of Basis document).  Because the permit
        conditions hold us to ppmvd values and not lb/yr or ton/year
        values, Transwestern is          concerned that under low load
        conditions of less than 60%, the emissions of NOx and CO would be
        40 ppmvd.  Transwestern is       requesting that  a provision be
        made in the permit conditions that  emissions of NOx and CO be held
        to 40 ppmvd during the 20 % of   the time that the turbines
        operating conditions is less than or equal to 60%.

        3.      The word "Catepillar" is mispelled throughout the permit.

        4.      Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas
        requires Transwestern to use methodologies (wet chemistry
        technology) that are not         normally used to monitor and
        measure sulfur in the natural gas.  Transwestern has received
        approval from the EPA for other custom     fuel monitoring
        schedules to use  "GPA Standard 2377" (length of stain tube) or gas
        chromatography as the proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in
        the natural gas.

The mid-year 2000 performance review process is about to begin.  The system 
will be accessible through the intranet, which should be of great help to 
those of you on international rotations.  The PEP system will open on Monday, 
May 15, and will close on Friday, June 9.  PRC meetings will start the week 
of June 12.  The global associate & analyst PRC review meeting is tentatively 
scheduled for July 19 - more details will be announced later.

Please review the attached training guide and quick reference guide.   They 
should answer most of your questions about the process and procedures.  If 
you cannot view or print the guides, please e-mail Gwendolyn Williams and she 
will mail hard copies to you.

All,
?
Today, the FERC  issued an order rejecting NYISO's request to lift the 
$2.52/MW bid cap on its  non-synchronized reserve market and ordered that a 
technical conference be  convened to find solutions to the problems in the 
non-synchronized reserve  market and also the energy market and its design 
flaws (as requested by  EPMI).? The Commission rejected NYISO's request 
because of its failure to  implement changes in the non-synchronized reserve 
market ordered by the  Commission and because the changes that were made do 
not significantly reduce  concentration of that market east of the central 
east constraint, but said that  it would lift the caps once the market could 
be demonstrated to be workably  competitive.
?
Commissioner Hebert  disented, in favor of lifting the bid caps as well as 
the $1000 cap on the  energy market.? He continues to support modifications 
to NYISO's markets  that would allow other suppliers to participate.? Hebert 
feels that a  technical conference would be ineffectual.
?
Commissioners  Breathitt and Massey supported the order.? Chairman Hoecker 
expressed a  long list of apprehensions about the markets and the process in 
New York,  likening his concerns to those expressed recently by the 
Commission regarding  California.? He?cited the staff report on its 
investigation of the  northeast bulk power markets, finding problems with the 
balkanization of the  markets and supporting the formation of a single 
Northeast regional  operation.

Team,
These are some points for discussion on the conference call next week.
In todays market, I think we all can agree that the profitability is there,
the only hurdle might be environmental or the potential for two phase flow.
If we could start with these points for discussion, and come to some
resolve on these issues, we can move to the logistics of the project.

   Results of the modeling conducted on the pipeline identifying the
   potential two phase flow. ( Ken Chow)
   Potential environmental concerns. (Emissions, Possible accumulation of
   liquid, Disposal of potential liquid).
        ( Larry Campbell )

Sense this project will be taking advantage of peaks in the market, the
most logical answer is to make this equipment portable. If we plan on long
term benefits at the California border, this could be a permit installation
with a pipeline hookup from a new rail facility in Needles. But, other
areas might be identified like inlets to power plants that justify portable
equipment with NGL supplied by truck. Supplying the butane by truck from
rail facility's like the one in Mohave, might also be a way to get the
project in Needles on-line sooner. Just some topic's for discussion.

   Natural Gas and NGL Pricing projections. ( Kevin Hyatt )
   Alternate points to inject the butane. ( Norm Spalding, Earl Chanley )
   Rail car leasing and availability. ( Randy Lagrimini, Larry Garrett )
   Rail carriers in the area, cost of transportation. ( Randy Lagrimini,
   Larry Garrett )
   Trucking companies in the area and cost of transportation. ( Randy
   Lagrimini, Larry Garrett )
   Mohave rail rack. ( Larry Garrett )
   Rail Rack construction cost. ( Randy Lagrimini, Rick Suderman )

Larry,

I hope you have been reading the emails below related to the NCLP in which 
the Bakersfield plant is located.  I think "Ed" (the EOTT lawyer) has 
realized that he's not going to "buffalo me" on any of these issues and will 
begin to openly share information and support my decision making on what we 
might be able to do there proactively.  Some things I will be doing are: (1) 
calling Randi McCormick the CWB in California who reportedly has more 
knowledge about the NCLP than anyone else.  I will be setting a meeting with 
her (probably at her office or wherever she keeps all of the records, maps, 
etc. on the preserve), so she might brief me on the NCLP and the restrictions 
that she believes EOTT is operating under with the HCP.  (2) I am placing 
calls to the Nature Conservancy in California to see what they know about the 
preserve (incidentally, the Steven McCormick, executive director of the 
California Chapter of TNC has been named the new President of the Nature 
Conservancy, succeeding the late John Sawhill).  I may give him a call and 
see who he recommends that I call in California to get the inside scoop on 
the North Coles Levee Preserve.  (3) I will make several other calls 
gathering information.  You need to: (1) begin talking with Scott Jones and 
Rick Sudderman to learn all you can from their perspective about the easement 
and the preserve. (2) be available to meet with me and Randi when I get a 
meeting set, (3) begin assisting my efforts to develop a proactive plan 
related to EOTT's involvement in the NCLP.

As always, thanks for your support.  John

Subject: Re: NCL Preserve History - Bakersfield  

 The State Take Permit and the Consevation Easement were mailed yesterday.  
Please let me know if you don't receive them by Friday.  

 You are quite right that the State Permit covers only state rare, threatened 
and endangered species.  However, with the sole exception of the San Joaquin 
Antelope Squirrel (which is state listed only), all state listed animal 
species are federally listed as well.  (Though the lists are virtually 
identical, the "rankings" on each list are not; that is, a species considered 
"endangered" by the state may only be considered "threatened" by the feds, 
and vice-versa,etc.)  Listed species of plant, on the other hand, are not the 
same federally and state.  Plus, there indeed are species of concern within 
the easement that are not yet listed.  Randi McCormick has some pretty 
comprehensive listings on both of these points (that is, lists of federally 
and state rare, threatened and endangered species of plants; and species of 
concern.)  I'll have her send info on this to you.  Lastly, I don't have a 
contact with the State Database folks, and I don't think we've ever dealt 
with them.

 I apologize if I seemed argumentative about Kenny -- I wasn't meaning to 
be.  I just wanted you to understand how and why that designation came 
about.  In any event, I would very much look forward to discussing with you 
and/or Larry, and/or whomever else you think should be involved, the habitat 
training issue, the status and further processing of our Federal Take Permit 
Application, and related topics.  Thanks. --ETA

Ed,
Maybe you didn't forward the copy of the Arco USFWS ITP on to Lou (which was 
sent on to me), regardless what I have in my possession is entitled "US Fish 
and Wildlife service - Incidental Take Permit No. 809228",dated 3/1/96 and 
made out to a permittee named: Arco Western Energy.  It is helpful to have it 
and I am grateful to whomever sent it my way.  I do appreciate your relating 
the chain of custody of the federal permit for the North Coles Levee 
Ecosystem Preserve (NCLEP).   Thanks also for sending Randi's phone numbers.  

I would appreciate a copy of the CDFG permit that has been assigned to EOTT 
and a copy of the Conservation Easement.  I assume that the State CDFG permit 
relates to only state rare, threatened and endangered species or does it also 
cover the federally listed species?  Are there any species of "concern" that 
the CDFG are working with within the easement boundaries beyond those 
officially listed?  Do you have a contact with the California Natural 
Heritage Program, California Natural Diversity Database (within the 
Califormia Dept. of Fish & Game) that you have been visiting with about the 
NCLEP? 

Again, I am not trying to argue the point about Kenny Maltby.  My point to 
you and others is that Kenny plainly told me that he has no comprehensive 
knowledge about the permit and the requirements of the permit.  He said he 
relies on you and Randi McCormick for that.  Your attempt to "stop-gap" (with 
Kenny since Gary had departed) to ensure representation in the field for the 
CDFG is understood.  I will want to further discuss with you the need to 
possibly have more people knowledgeable in the matters of the permit and 
involved in the execution of the same with the CDFG.

Subject: Re: NCL Preserve History - Bakersfield  

 I don't believe I sent you the Arco USFWS ITP.   No federal take permit was 
ever assigned to EOTT by Koch because Koch represented that it did not have 
such a permit; rather, it purportedly was having discussions with USFWS re 
this issue pending at the time of the asset sale to EOTT.   As I understand 
it, any such federal permit was not assigned by Arco to Koch, for whatever 
reason and, consequently, EOTT ended up not having a federal permit assigned 
to it by Koch.  Instead, we took over the application process from Koch.  
That application is still pending.

 The permit from which I quoted in the email was the California Department of 
Fish and Game ITP between CDFG and Koch, which was assigned to EOTT in 
connection with the asset purchase.  I'll be happy to send you a copy, along 
with a copy of the Conservation Easement that is referenced in my last email.

 Regarding Kenny Maltby, the short answer is, of course, ETS can -- and 
indeed should -- designate whomever it thinks best to be the "representative 
responsible for communications with the [CDFG] and for oversing the 
compliance with the take permit."   But, as of last Wednesday, the designated 
representative was Gary Fuller.  Matt Hughes, et al, informed me that they 
wanted to begin construction on the Rogas Line by February 1, and possibly as 
early as January 23.  Consequently, a new representative had to be named on 
short order (in fact, the permit technically requires such notice 30 days in 
advance of "ground disturbing activities."  While the CDFG will cut us some 
slack in view of Gary's departure, that indulgence is probably not 
limitless.)   

 I continue to believe that Kenny M was the only logical choice.  While I 
believe Rick Suderman and Scott Jones specifically (and all plant employees 
generally) are aware of the habitat and a number of the operational issues 
covered by the take permit, I believe Kenny has a more comprehensive 
knowledge of the permit requirements in their entirety (including 
preconstruction and construction measures, and compensation acreage 
requirements), as well as how they apply to pipeline construction generally 
and this project specifically.  (I tend to think that Kenny's "warm body" 
comment is more a reflection of his modesty than the intent here: in fact, I 
thought of Kenny only because I did not want just a warm body appointed.)  
Simply put, I was attempting a stop-gap measure to ensure that this specific 
project got off the ground on ETS's own schedule; I was in no way attempting 
to dictate who would be the representative for the long term.  

 Randi McCormick's phone is 661-589-4065, and her fax is 661-619-0372.

 If you need anything else, please let me know.  

 Thanks.  --ETA

Ed,
Lou forwarded your email on to me and I appreciate getting it.  The 
information I received (I assume from you) is actually a copy of a USFWS 
Incidental Take Permit (ITP), dated 3/1/96 which is related to a "Habitat 
Conservation Plan" (HCP) covering a portion of the San Joaquin Valley floor 
in Kern County, CA.  The permittee is shown as Arco Western Energy.  I am 
assuming that the ITP was transferred to Koch and then subsequently to EOTT 
as those property sales consummated.  In order to more fully understand how 
this permit relates to the EOTT facilities, could I obtain a copy of the 
permit from which you are quoting in your email (I don't find those sections 
or quotes in the copy Lou forwarded)?    

I found a paragraph very interesting in your email relating that "Kenny 
Maltby" is the designated "representative responsible for communications with 
the California Department of Fish and Game and for overseeing the compliance 
with the 'take permit'" and that the two of you are the only personnel in 
California who are aware of the Permit and its requirements.   It is my 
understanding that Kenny reports into Randy Rice's organization and works for 
Rich Jolly.  I believe that Kenny was only designated last Friday, by a 
letter mailed to California Game and Fish as such a representative and in his 
own words he is: "a warm body for the California Game and Fish to contact 
related to the permit."   I have no problem with Kenny being a contact during 
the pipeline construction in the area, but may want to make some further 
changes on contacts as we learn more about the Conservation Easement and its 
restrictions.

I recall, that Randi McCormick was the CWB being used for work in the 
Conservation Area and I plan to give her a call.  By the way, can you please 
furnish her phone number for me. 

Again, please furnish a more complete copy of the permit and any other 
information that might explain more fully the easement and its requirements.  

Thanks, John

Roger-
We will require off-site access for the installation of 10 remediation wells 
at the North Crawar facility (formerly owned by TW but now owned by Duke). I 
will drop off in your office a site diagram that indicates the location of 
the wells relative to the facility and the existing wells. I believe that the 
adjacent property owner had been contacted prior to well installations in 
August 1997, but I am not familiar with the details of the access agreement 
or even who within ET&S made the arrangements. We are shooting for 
early-October for the well installations. We may also want to address 
continued access to the wells in an agreement with the landowner (a 5-10 year 
term should be sufficient). Give me a call at x67327 if you have any 
questions.
Thanks,
George

Four of the six new monitor wells at the Laguna C/S have accumulated 
groundwater. Groundwater samples were collected from these wells on April 
5th. Lab results indicate elevated concentrations of halogenated organic 
compounds in samples collected from two of the wells. Three replacement wells 
will be drilled for the two wells which do not produce water and for one of 
the wells which only has two feet of water in the screen interval. The 
installation of the replacement wells is tentatively scheduled for the week 
of May 8th. A feasibility study for active remediation measures in the former 
impoundment area has been completed.  
The Lockridge semiannual groundwater sampling was completed.  Results will be 
forwarded to the state of Texas.
The quarterly groundwater sampling at the NNG Gomez Plant was completed. The 
recovery system was shutdown from January 17th through April 21st in order to 
evaluate the accumulation rate of PSH in recovery wells. The accumulation 
rate of PSH has been reduced considerably from the accumulation rate prior to 
active remediation. The system was re-started on April 21st and will be 
operated in a similar manner as it was operated prior to the shutdown. 
Transwestern Pipeline Company met with officials of PG&E to discuss recent 
sampling activities on the PG&E system with respect to PCB's.  Results of the 
sampling efforts have shown that PCB's have moved downstream into existing 
interconnects and into lines which feed customers.  PG&E has indicated that 
they will install small filter separators at these interconnects at pricing 
thus far of around $2MM.  This does not include the costs for the mainline 
filter separators which should be in service in June of this year.   PG&E has 
indicated that they will continue sampling at downstream locations to further 
determine the "front of PCB's"
A revised Title V application was submitted for the Keystone C/S turbine 
"power unit" replacement.   Fuel monitoring and emissions testing under NSPS 
will be initiated pending completion of the turbine component replacement. 
A meeting was held in Gallup to discuss the forthcoming pipeline PCB modeling 
project to be initiated in Arizona.  Environmental concerns relating to 
management and disposal of the liquids, permitting and compliance issues were 
discussed.   This project will be initiated between C/S 4 and C/S 3.  If 
successful, the modeling approach and methodology will be implemented 
throughout the contaminated portions of Transwestern Pipeline.

Dave Conway.

Summarizing the issue as I can understand them.

1. Your problem.  Cat will have to change the units at Station 2 to 3512 to 
make the driver HP for 370 kw.  As I indicated we need to also make 
adjustment so that the emissions do not exceed that of the 3508 as presented 
originally on March 21.

2. My problem.  The EPA will only allow the generators to emit a cumulative 
tonnage that works out to be 7826 running hours a year.  To get the 8736 
hours that I need the generation (at both stations) I will need to reduce 
total emissions by about 11 percent.  Obviously, in the fully loaded 
condition were at, lower horsepower is not an option.

Need some way to work these two items out to a mutually agreeable solution.  
Don't know the effect on your systems (ie: the cat engines) if a catalytic 
system is installed or if this is better then revision to the clean burn 
units (which if I recall just makes the hp worse).  

I'd also like to keep the units at 2 and 3 similar, for spare issues and 
other items, but would need to have a good idea what this is costing before I 
can approve.  

The other issue is that I need to resolve this within two days.  I be in 
Phoenix tomorrow but will leave my cell phone on.  713-850-1725.  Otherwise, 
leave a message on phone mail.  Email will not be all that great.

Appreciate your help.
Byron

Based upon valving constraints and the innaccessability to the inside of the 
pipe between our M/S and the Topock C/S, a decision has been made to postpone 
cleaning of his section of the pipeline.  should cleaning occur of this 
section, it is anticipated that it will not occur untill the installation of 
the filter separator at the PG&E C/S, sometime later this year.  Vector has 
been notified of this change in plans and will adjust their cleaning 
schedule  accordingly.

Dear Market Participants:

There will be a short disruption to the telephones at the NYISO
due to the conversion to a new telephone system tonight.  The
Customer Relations Helpdesk and critical Operations lines will
be the last ones disconnected and the first ones reconnected.
We anticipate the outage for these lines will be short.

If you cannot get through, please try again in 10 - 15 minutes
or you can send an email to market_relations@nyiso and we will
use one of our back-up cell phones to contact you.

Our apologies for the inconvenience but it is unavoidable as
we switch to the improved telephone system.


Regards,

Customer Relations, NYISO

Tired of the 40 X 40 X 40 Plan? You know:

Work 40 hours per week for someone else for 40 years, then receive a 40%

with no personal reward and even less future?

If you're determined to retire in the next 2 - 5 years with enough income to 
have REAL Financial Independence and Freedom, and are not afraid to work for 
it, I can help you.

I am looking for people with a Good Work Ethic and extraordinary Desire to 
Earn at Least $10,000 per Month Working From Home!

NO SPECIAL SKILLS OR EXPERIENCE REQUIRED. We will give you all the training 
and personal support you will need to ensure your success!

This LEGITIMATE HOME-BASED INCOME OPPORTUNITY can put you back in Control of 
your Time, Your Finances, and Your Life!

If you've tried other opportunities in the past that have failed to live up 
to their promises, THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN ANYTHING ELSE YOU'VE SEEN!
THIS IS NOT A GET-RICH-QUICK SCHEME!

YOUR FINANCIAL PAST DOES NOT HAVE TO BE YOUR FINANCIAL FUTURE!

CALL ONLY IF YOU ARE SERIOUS!

Subject: 2001 Domestic Audit Calendar

Attached for your information and planning is the projected ETS audit 
calendar for 2001.  As you can see there are a few changes in the calendar 
for next year. This year we welcome Don Bruce to the audit program.  Don 
joins Enron Quality Management from the EOTT organization as an additional 
Audit Director.  As can be seen, we have blended the EOTT assets into the ETS 
calendar.  Next year ETS will be going to a four year rotation for auditing 
team assets therefore, we have scheduled and will be conducting forty-two 
domestic audits.  

Major changes are also happening within our program design for 2001. First, 
five unannounced audits will be conducted giving management a picture of how 
well the assets are being operated on a day to day basis.   Also, new to the 
program this year, the  audits conducted by our audit teams will be scored .  
In January we are introducing a new electronic format to the audit process.  
This new computerized program should greatly enhance the audit process by 
giving EQM the capability of:

Producing enhanced audit reports
Generating site specific verification points (formally questions)
Producing statistical graphs and data
Scoring by category or total audit 
Increasing objectivity
Generating historical data for review

Enron Quality Management is enthuastically looking forward to 2001and the 
progressive program that we have outlined to help ensure "quality management" 
of our gas and liquid facilities.  During this holiday season we would like 
to take this opportunity to extend to each of you and your families the 
happiest of holidays and a progressive and prosperous new year.

Larry,

Glad the conditions work for you.  Those are the only conditions I had any
question about.  We never share entire draft permits before public notice.
Occasionally, if there is a question about a specific issue, we'll share
one or two conditions.  That's what happened here.

Roger, these conditions will work out just fine for the generators.  I have
passed them on to our project director and he has given them the thumbs up.
I really appreciate you giving me the opportunity to comment on the
conditions.  Id like to have a peek at the other conditions in the permit
as you develop them, just to expidite the issuance.  Thanks for working
with us on this.....

Hi Larry,

Per our conversation today, I want to make sure I understand your intent
for the transition periods for Klagetoh and Leupp.  Below are two
conditions from the draft Klagetoh permit.  We would use the same approach
for Leupp.  Please let me know whether we have understood your intent
correctly.  Note that there will also be some associated recordkeeping
requirements.

Subject: Re: Rogas Line -- USFW Approval



     I don't know the exact cost number for compensation acreage, but the
following info may help for planning purposes.  (Also, I don't know if any
number for such acreage was included in the cost figures presented to the
Board; presumably some estimate was included.)

     There are two different types of compensation credits we will need to
purchase: Coles Levee Ecopreserve (CLEP) credits, and Kern Water Bank (KWB)
credits.

     For KWB, we will need 24 acres to start the project.  From the figures
I have been quoted, these should cost $62,000.  This is only for
installation of the new lines, however, and does not include acreage to
cover removal of the existing line. (I will not here hazard a quess as to
how many additional acres this will require, but it could well be that same
amount again, as the lines are the same length.)  The Enron folks can
determine the actual number.

     For CLEP, we need 15.3 acres.  While our take permit only requires us
to post a letter of credit for $16,500, in lieu of immediate purchase, as
security to ensure we will follow through with the actual purchase, I
believe the actual cost of buying the credits will be higher -- perhaps
three times that amount, because the market for these credits has firmed
substantially since Koch was issued that permit.  Again, the Enron folks
can give us a hard number once they get an actual quote from Aera or some
other seller.

     So, I believe we are looking at a best case of about $100,000, and
worst case of $175,000 for purchasing compensation acreage.  John, do you
agree?

     Thanks.  --ETA

What if any cost impact does this have on EOTT.  Make sure we get the
capital approved and that we (EOTT) are aware of the cost.  The cost of the
project has been approved by the Board  and if I need to go back to them
with a revised economic analysis, I will need some time.  This goes for the
truck rack as well.

I obtained a copy of a letter sent to Gary Fuller from the Department of
Fish and Game on November 3, 2000. In the letter the Fish and Game agreed
EOTT has 41 Acres of conservation credits based on Arco Western Energy's
sale of the North Coles Levee fractionator plant and premises to Koch Oil
and Gas, and Koch's subsequent sale of the plant and premises to EOTT
ENERGY.

In the letter the following limitations and clarifications were listed:

Because the conservation credits may be used for mitigation of EOTT
impacts, or sold by EOTT to third parties for their own mitigation needs,
EOTT must affirm that it will conform to the Department's  standards for
sale of conservation credits as well as management of the credit lands.

These obligations are already implied by the chain of Koch's and then
EOTT's acquisitions  of the North Coles Levee fractionator plant. EOTT and
Department representatives will need to meet to discuss these details and
determine the most efficient means to implement these conditions.

Key provision of the obligations that attend using the conservation credits
include Department approval of third-party sales;  minimum endowment
requirements for all credit sales; management and monitoring of habitat
conditions; and additional mitigation for disturbance to dedicated habitat.

Habitat continuity and small animal movement between the North Coles
fractionator plant site and the remainder of Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve
must be provided in order to maintain viability of the habitat within
EOTT's holdings.

 Although it appears we do have the credits for NCL, I do not know if Gary
ever met with the Fish and Game to discuss the details or means to
implement the conditions for use of the conservation credits. With the
project set to start we may have to purchase the 15.3 acres of credit from
Area.

Kenny and Scott,

I agree with Ed's note concerning the need to move expeditiously in the
purchase of compensation acreage noted by the US Fish and Wildlife Service
(Service) in there approval letter.  This in indeed "good news" and EOTT
must move ahead to fulfill its obligation as per the MOU and Incidental
Take Permit.  By copy of this email, I am asking Larry Campbell to work
with both of you to assist in the proper fulfillment of EOTT's obligation
as promptly as possible.

It is also my understanding, from what research I have been able to do,
that EOTT does have approximately 14 to 15 acres of credit at the North
Coles Levee Preserve.  You should verify the exact credit number and
furnish the Service with such verification.  That is acreage EOTT will not
have to purchase in satisfying the obligation of the permit.

Keep me posted as you move forward on this issue.  John Shafer

Subject:  Rogas Line -- USFW Approval


     Randi McCormick just forwarded to me a letter addressed to EOTT, dated
February 14, 2001  from the US Fish and Wildlife Service approving our
project "for participation in the Kern Water Bank Compensation Bank," and
authorizing the Water Bank "to extend their incidental take authority to
you and your entire project under their Master Permit."  This is, of
course, very good news.

     The letter notes, however, that we still need to purchase compensation
acreage both at North Coles Levee and at the Kern Water Bank.
Specifically, we must do the following:  (1) contact Cheryl Harding of Kern
Water Bank to acquire 23.1 acres of compensation credits, and to get
included in their Master Permit; and (2) get Cheryl Harding a letter from
the Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve (Mark Poe of Aera) stating that we have
purchased 15.3 acres of credits for North Coles Levee, or that we have set
aside that amount from credits we have in the past purchased.

     While I could make these contacts, I do not believe that would be wise
because -- as Kenny can attest -- our past experience has been that
whenever a lawyer contacts the Water Bank, it prompts them to automatically
get their lawyers involved.  And our experience has been that this only
slows things down -- or worse.

     My suggestion therefore is that one or both of you gentlemen contact
Cheryl as soon as practical and ask her for (1) proposed contract for
acquisition of 23.1 acres of compensation credits and (2) perperwork to
include EOTT (and its contractors) in their Master Permit.  She should also
be informed that, while we have not yet purchased the 15.3 acres of NCL
credits, we will by the end of this week have a letter of credit posted as
security, as allowed under our State Take Permit, to cover this amount of
acreage.  Ask whether a copy of this LC will suffice for her purposes, or
whether we will need to have the actual acreage purchased.

     As this would remove a major impediment to construction of the new
lines, it is important that we move on this will all deliberate speed.
Please call me if you have any questions, or if you would like otherwise to
discuss how to approach this issue.  Thanks a lot.

                          --ETA

I'm complete on everything you wanted, the ball is back in your court.
 This will just be
a quick update on the status of everything, as I see it, based on the
information provided.

1.  A priority package was sent to you and should arrive by 8/30/01 which
includes an

-updated diskette for the EOTT PL TANKS Excel workbook, which now includes:
--a station summary (worksheet) of TNRCC emission fees for the 13 stations
which owe them, plus Crane and McElroy, which don't.  Fees are due to
TNRCC by 11/1.  Necessary account numbers have been obtained.

--a detailed tank emissions worksheet, with emissions by tank based on
throughput, and the total emissions for the station. More importantly, the
9 conditions which trigger the TNRCC emissions fee are listed for your
reference.

2.  Hard copies of the station summary,  the more detailed tank summary,
and the TANKS 4.09 tank
emission computer printouts for the 15 sites are provided.  For your info
only, I also "marked-up" a tank listing and tank inspection schedule which
indicate updates I made since last month.

3.  Regulatory Compliance:
Texas: No inspection fees for SIC 4612.  Emissions fees due by 11/01. See
#1 above.

NMex:  No fees.  Tank regulations in development.  No problem.

Federal, NSPS:  5 New Mexico tanks (1-LocoHills West, 4-Maljamar) are Kb
subject and require control, unless they meet exemption.  Further
investigation and documentation required.




4.  As always, my pleasure to be of assistance.  Bill Glushko 281 953-1014

Hi Larry,

Finally got the documentation you sent in.  Jim Linville and I reviewed it.  
Neither of us believe you need any authorization to do what you did/are 
doing.  In our opinion, there is no change to your grandfathered status, nor 
a need to update your Title V permit.

Having said that, by now you probably know that the Texas legislature seems 
intent on closing out grandfathered status as of September 1st.  Our view is 
that your reworked engines have a clear shot at coming in under the VERP  
entry to permitting.  I would also suggest you check the 1972 Standard 
Exemption No. 7.  One way of the other, you should plan to end the 
grandfather status of these engines soon.

On the Title V permit, if you have a General Operating Permit (most likely), 
it will be due for renewal in the short term (next year marks the 5th 
anniversary for most GOPs).  We suggest you incorporate any changes due to 
the engine reworks at that time.  If you have an issued SOP, do the same.  If 
your SOP is still pending, contact your Permit reviewer here at TNRCC for 
guidance.
So, will this e-mail answer your needs?

Regards,
Duncan Stewart

Ray,
What if you want your transaction to be cut if the economics support it? You
change your DAM ( or leave it at the original bid) to a price sensitive bid 
and
the BME promises you that price you wanted in your bid, then SCD runs and the
real time (no constraints thus no BME clearing) runs up due operational
restrictions and the price you get clobbers you? Like it did before the $20 K
adder. All these problems would go away if the BME clearing at the Proxy
busses,passed by BIC and MC ,was implemented. Baby-sitting your DAM bids would
solve the " schedule and forget deal" but if you have any arb or price 
sensitive
schedules then you run into the risk above.  Given the apparent limitations of
the NYISO (software ?) we might have to pick and choose which band aid 
approach
is more palatable.

Kenny,
I received a note from Dave Schafer's office that they had received a note 
from you that they thought should have come to me instead of Dave.  They were 
correct.  Please take note, for future emails, that I am John Shafer and not 
Dave Schafer.

Now, related to the essence of your email message below.  I am still in the 
process of gather information related to the California Endangered Species 
Act Memorandum or Understanding and Take Authorization as agreed to by the 
Koch Oil Company and the California Department of Fish and Game on Jan. 2, 
1998 (related to which Ed Attanasio has stated that such MOU and permit was 
assigned to EOTT after the sale of the facilities to EOTT).   I am requesting 
from Mr. Attanasio copies of the January 10 Annual Report that supposedly 
have been filed by EOTT with the CDFG related to activities associated with 
this MOU.  I am also holding conversations with Randi McCormick and Ed 
Attanasio related to the status of the USFWS Federal Incidental Take Permit 
issued to Arco Western Energy in March, 1996 covering the same properties.  
Therefore, my comments are somewhat cursory at this point - but I'm getting 
up to speed pretty fast on this very important issue.  

We need to thoroughly understand what agreements are in place (both with the 
CDFG and the USFWS) before we do something within this protected preserve to 
one of these rare, threatened or endangered species that we will all live to 
regret.  Everything may be perfect and all agency personnel happy as a "tree 
frog in the middle of a swamp in August," but I'm not convinced yet that we 
even know what these predecessors agreed to and why.

Some of the things I am aware of at this point:
The California MOU and Incidental Take Permit applies to the North Coles 
Levee Natural Gas Fractionator Plant, Rogas Railcar facility, 250 miles of 
existing pipeline, and 155 miles of proposed pipeline. (Caveat: Is this 
project part of the 155 miles that has already been presented to the CDFG by 
Koch or is this something outside that agreement?  Also, what about the US 
Fish and Wildlife Service concerns over these species?  Where is the 
agreement with the USFWS?  If there is not one done a full-blown 
Environmental Impact Study will have to be performed to get the Section 7 
consultation done under the Federal Endangered Specie Act!).

The North Coles Plant occupies 90 acres - right in the heart of the protected 
preserve.

California Endangered species involved by the MOU and permit: 10 animals, 1 
shrimp, 10 plants (all of these are also Federally Endangered).
California Protected species involved by the MOU and permit: 2 animals (these 
are not listed by the Feds).

"Take Authorizations" are very restricted (another words, if you illegally 
"take, kill, harrass, damage their habitat, etc." one of these plants or 
animals - you go to jail and do not collect $200 when you pass go".

Notices of activities to the CDFG are very restrictive and must be precisely 
completed prior to any ground disturbance.  In certain instances, prior to 
any human intrusion into protected areas.

Orientation and training related to the species, permit, restrictions, etc. 
must be done with all employees prior to entering a construction area.

Biologist must be on hand for all activities.

All covers on oil drains, pipes, pits, etc. must be maintained as to prevent 
injury to wildlife.

Pre-activity survey work must be done before any off-road driving is done 
(except in case of emergency).

Mitigation:  Permanent loss of habitat 3 to 1
  Temporary loss of habitat 1.1 to 1
  Compensation provided on annual basis in advance of year's activities 
(Caveat: Has this been   done?)

All pipe will be inspected prior to moving it.  

If a trapped or an injured animal is discovered, the CDFG is to be notified 
immediately.

All trenches are to provide an escape route for animals (in steep wall trench 
areas).

Lizards - in areas where the Blunt-Nosed Leopard Lizard are found, all 
excavation is to be done by hand!  Daylight work only.

Revegetate with local stock.

Reports during and post construction must be timely as indicated in permit.

All other activities (regular maintenance during the year) are to be reported 
on a January 10 Report filed with the CDFG stating the effectiveness of the 
measures taken.

Koch was to establish a "Pledged Savings Account" or trust for the amount 
needed to stand behind the activities undertaken during the year - until such 
"Habitat Management Land" would be donated by Koch to mitigate for the 
impacts that had occurred.  Also, Koch was to provide an "Endowment" to CDFG 
for management of any new lands donated and pay all reasonable expenses.  (I 
assume this also applies to EOTT now that EOTT is the owner).

Koch could proceed (under this State Permit) with ground disturbance 
activities, prior to having the acreage to donate, as long as the savings 
account and/or trust was set up and funded to cover the activities.

Any default and the permit is rescinded and the CDFG will bring all charges 
(both corporate and individual).

Term - 25 years from Jan. 2, 1998.

(Caveat: A "Scott Clark" signed this agreement on behalf of Koch in 1998.  Is 
this the same Scott Clark that now works for Randy Rice?  


As you can see, I only know enough about this issue at this point to be 
dangerous.  However, I would caution each and every one of you to proceed 
with appropriate caution until we have all of the facts.  If we have a 
problem with the proposed construction or with our daily maintenance 
activities related to any of these species or this agreement, we will need to 
have all the facts correctly identified and completed.

I am also attempting to have a conference call with most of you to discuss 
this very important issue.  

Thanks, John Shafer

__________________

The California Fish and Game must give there approval of the project before 
we can start construction. It is my understanding that they have the project 
on there desk and are looking at it. Once we receive there approval we will 
send a biologist out to trap for three days to see what species are in the 
path of construction. At the same time we can put up the bond for purchase of 
the required compensation lands with the Kern Water Bank Authority and Area 
Energy. The 1081 permit we have with the Fish and Game requires a 14 day 
notices before start of construction with a company contact. Under Ed 
Attanasio guidance I sent notice of construction to the Fish and Game and 
that I would be the local contact for this project. One issue that could keep 
us from trapping is the outside temperature, if it is to cold the species 
will be trapped and not able to get back to there burrows and will freeze to 
death. Randi McCormick believes we will have approval in two weeks but there 
is not any guarantee, the State works at there own pace.

The second issues is a stream bed alteration permit with the Army Corp of 
Engineers for crossing the Kern River By-Pass channel. Gary Fuller had put 
West Coast Environmental in charge of getting this permit. I talked with them 
Friday and they had not turned in the application yet. Typically these 
permits take 30 to 45 days for approval, they assured me they would get the 
application submitted. We could use someone in environmental to get involved 
with this.

Larry I have another project for you. We need you to go to Bakersfield and 
get with Kenny Maltby and Dennis Watts on the Ro Gas project. Kenny has a 
handle on it but I would like for you to look the permits over and tell us 
we're OK to start construction. You will probably want o visit the different 
agencies while you're there. Kenny can you furnish us some information so 
Larry will know what's going on. By the way this needs to be fast tracked. We 
were supposed to start construction on January 22. Let me know what you need. 
Working together we'll get some of these projects taken care of.
Thanks

about the project and asked them to look at alternate points to inject the 
butane. Earl stated that we might be able to do this in California rather 
than the point we're looking at. Norm and Earl have you had a chance to think

adesell@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

An issue surfaced during the conduct of the current Spring 2001
TCC Auction related to import limit to New York from Hydro
Quebec (HQ) .  In one round of the Spring auction, bids were
received requesting a large number of TCCs with a POI of the
HQ Proxy bus.  These bids, if awarded, would exceed the HQ
import limit of 1200 MW used in the TCC auctions.

The 1200 MW HQ import limit was based on internal conversations
within the NYISO.  These conversations indicated that congestion
differences between the HQ Proxy bus and internal New York buses
would be produced in SCUC at the 1200 MW import level.  One
auction participant questioned the modeling of the HQ import limit.
After further review, the NYSIO agreed that the HQ import limit used
in the TCC auctions could be increased to 1500 MW, as long as
the same SCUC operating policy for the HQ import was followed.
This policy allows for a 1500 MW HQ import, if at least 300 MW of
that import is due to wheel through transactions.

The ISO will implement this operating policy in the TCC auction as
follows.  TCC awarded from the HQ Proxy bus to internal New York
buses will be limited to 1200 MW.  Total TCC awards from the HQ
Proxy bus will be limited to 1500 MW.  TCCs awarded in the reverse
direction (i.e., into the HQ Proxy bus) will net against those TCCs
awarded in the opposite direction.  Also, existing uses of the
transmission system will be included.  Existing uses include
Grandfathered Rights, Grandfathered TCCs and TCCs awarded
in previous auctions that have not expired.

To incorporate this operating policy in subsequent TCC auctions,
the following bidding rule is being established:

For TCC bids from the HQ Proxy bus to an internal New York bus or
zone and from an internal New York bus or zone to the HQ Proxy bus,
PTID 61844 must be used for the POI or POW as appropriate.

For TCC bids that represent wheels through from the HQ Proxy bus to
another external proxy bus (i.e., NE Proxy, OH Proxy, PJM Proxy) and
from another external proxy bus to the HQ Proxy bus, PTID 23651 must
be used as the POI or POW as appropriate.

These PTID designations will allow the NYISO to identify TCC bids and
properly model those bids as they relate to the Hydro Quebec import
limit in the TCC auction.

PTIDs 61844 and 23651 were chosen because the LBMPs and the
individual components of the LBMPs in the Day-Ahead market are identical.

This new bidding opportunity in the TCC auctions will be allowed
beginning with the May 2001 Reconfiguration Auction scheduled for
April 23, 2001.

Mike   
We completed the decontamination on both of the filter separators on the 
discharge of the Solexol Plant.  There was a thin film of an oily substance 
(presumably Solexol) on the interior wall of the filter separators.  However, 
both sets of filters were very clean.  No moisture was present on the filters 
and there was not any sludge or build up on any of the filters.  The filters 
that were removed had the same appearance of a brand new filter.  As a matter 
or fact, when you laid a new filter beside a used filter you could not tell a 
difference.  The filters being used are a Sock type filter and when you ran 
your hand across the filters you could not detect the presence of any 
moisture at all.

So, it's presumed that the system has been completely absent of any liquid.  
The small amounts of liquid being collected from week to week for sampling 
must have been accumulated from the run down or film, pre-existing on the 
interior of the filter separator housing.  A decontamination and triple rinse 
of each filter separator should result in a total absence of any liquid for 
future samples, other than the remaining soap and water used for the final 
rinse that could not be drained from the vessels.

Rich and I visited the Topock compressor station this morning and reviewed 
the sampling point on PG&E's inlet scrubber.  Rich made the recommendation to 
Randy Williams and Rick Bezanson (PG&E) that future samples be taken straight 
off the bottom of the scrubber rather than from PG&E's 1000 gallon blow down 
tank.  The purpose of this was to reduce the exposure to contaminating future 
samples with pre-existing PCB's that may have collected in the 1000 gallon 
blow down tank over a period of time.  PG&E agreed to sample from this point 
on future collections.

Both of the discharge lines on each filter separator at the Solexol plant 
have been hot tapped in preparation of Solexol injection.  Piping has been 
installed and pumps are in place to accommodate the Solexol injection as 
well.  However, NO injection of Solexol will take place until after our 
meeting next Tuesday with PG&E.

Transwestern has agreed with PG&E today to postpone our planned 
decontamination of the filter separator at Transwesterns PG&E meter station 
until April 28th, at which time Transwestern and PG&E will perform a 
decontamination of both TW's and PG&E's filter separators simultaneously.   

                                                                              
               Thanks, Tiny

We completed decontamination of the inlet filter at the selexol plant today. 
It was dirty but 
no liquid. There was some dried sludge in the bottom of the vessel and the 
filters were 
extremely dirty. We plan to do both of the filters on the discharge side 
tomorrow.I got a phone 
messsage from Jeff and he hasn't heard anything from PGE since the letter was 
sent . We will 
plan to bypass and clean the filter on the west side of the river, last one 
on our system Saturday
unless we hear something different tomorrow. We will notify the PGE operators 
of their plant 
tomorrow of our plans.If anyone needs to contact me my pager number is 
1-800-921-9564 and office
phone number is 505-260-4003. Leave a message on the office phone and it will 
automatically
page me. I'll give everyone an update late tomorrow. We should have the hot 
tap valves on location 
tomorrow for the selexol injection. We plan to install the valves as soon as 
they arrive.

Thanks RJ

By the way Bisti came on line today and they plan to run it tonight and be 
back on location to 
check on the unit tomorrow.

Eric and Kevin,

Attached is a preliminary timeline for working through all of the 
environmental related issues to deliver the necessary Resource Reports (F-1) 
for the FERC application.  There will be more details to be fleshed-out in 
the timeline, but essentially this is what we believe is strategically needed 
to deliver a complete exhibit.  If we can get the land managing agencies to 
agree to work early and collaboratively with the FERC Staff on this project, 
we may be able to get the FERC Staff to commit early resources to the project 
and cut a month or two off the tail end.  A lot of this success will be 
accomplished if we can get clearance to get on the land and perform the 
ground truthing survey work.  John

John, Scott Jones, I believe is still on vacation in Hawaii of all places.
And I believe you are correct that we have around 15 acres of existing
credit.  Kenny, let me know what you want me to do in this.

Subject:  Re: Rogas Line -- USFW Approval




Kenny and Scott,

I agree with Ed's note concerning the need to move expeditiously in the
purchase of compensation acreage noted by the US Fish and Wildlife Service
(Service) in there approval letter.  This in indeed "good news" and EOTT
must move ahead to fulfill its obligation as per the MOU and Incidental
Take Permit.  By copy of this email, I am asking Larry Campbell to work
with both of you to assist in the proper fulfillment of EOTT's obligation
as promptly as possible.

It is also my understanding, from what research I have been able to do,
that EOTT does have approximately 14 to 15 acres of credit at the North
Coles Levee Preserve.  You should verify the exact credit number and
furnish the Service with such verification.  That is acreage EOTT will not
have to purchase in satisfying the obligation of the permit.

Keep me posted as you move forward on this issue.  John Shafer

Subject:  Rogas Line -- USFW Approval


     Randi McCormick just forwarded to me a letter addressed to EOTT, dated
February 14, 2001  from the US Fish and Wildlife Service approving our
project "for participation in the Kern Water Bank Compensation Bank," and
authorizing the Water Bank "to extend their incidental take authority to
you and your entire project under their Master Permit."  This is, of
course, very good news.

     The letter notes, however, that we still need to purchase compensation
acreage both at North Coles Levee and at the Kern Water Bank.
Specifically, we must do the following:  (1) contact Cheryl Harding of Kern
Water Bank to acquire 23.1 acres of compensation credits, and to get
included in their Master Permit; and (2) get Cheryl Harding a letter from
the Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve (Mark Poe of Aera) stating that we have
purchased 15.3 acres of credits for North Coles Levee, or that we have set
aside that amount from credits we have in the past purchased.

     While I could make these contacts, I do not believe that would be wise
because -- as Kenny can attest -- our past experience has been that
whenever a lawyer contacts the Water Bank, it prompts them to automatically
get their lawyers involved.  And our experience has been that this only
slows things down -- or worse.

     My suggestion therefore is that one or both of you gentlemen contact
Cheryl as soon as practical and ask her for (1) proposed contract for
acquisition of 23.1 acres of compensation credits and (2) perperwork to
include EOTT (and its contractors) in their Master Permit.  She should also
be informed that, while we have not yet purchased the 15.3 acres of NCL
credits, we will by the end of this week have a letter of credit posted as
security, as allowed under our State Take Permit, to cover this amount of
acreage.  Ask whether a copy of this LC will suffice for her purposes, or
whether we will need to have the actual acreage purchased.

     As this would remove a major impediment to construction of the new
lines, it is important that we move on this will all deliberate speed.
Please call me if you have any questions, or if you would like otherwise to
discuss how to approach this issue.  Thanks a lot.

                          --ETA

John, this is a short note to let you know where we stand on the  7 mile 
pipeline construction Rogas Project with respect to environmental  permitting 
and approvals.

The following documents and applications have been submitted to the agencies:

 California fish and game 1603 application

 Kern County Floodplain Management Agency-encroachment application

 US COE 404 Nationwide permit- preconstruction notification

 Reclamation Board- encroachment application

 Califonia State Fire Marshall-waiver to install aboveground pipeline

 Office of Pipeline Safety-waiver to Install aboveground pipeline

I am checking to see what state requirements there are for SHPO clearances 
for this project.  I would suspect that they would  want us to do a field 
survey prior to construction.  It seems that every Califonia state and county 
agency is a candidate for notification or approval.   Ill keep you 
apprised......

Larry, this is a potential issue, at least from an accounting perspective. 
The total dollar amount for 1999 Expense in the ET&S Albuquerque Region is 
$345,000 (excluding Gomez, Bell Lake, & N. Crawar remediation projects which 
are accounted for separately due to sale agreements). This amount is not 
allocated for specific projects but includes all environmental O&M costs for 
the region. As it is, this amount may not be sufficient to cover costs for 
the ongoing Expense projects, including: Thoreau Lease Payment, Roswell 
Remediation, WT-1 Dehy Area Remediation, WT-1 Pit Area Remediation, Eunice 
Monitoring, & Puckett Monitoring. The Albuquerque Region 1999 Capital budget 
for remediation projects is about $270,000; this includes: Thoreau 
Remediation, Laguna Groundwater Remediation, Lockridge Remediation, and 
Atoka-1 Remediation. If the capital projects are rolled into O&M, the O&M 
budget will be far too insufficient. A related issue is concerning the 
allocated AFUDC costs. These costs will add about $60,000 to the Thoreau 
Remediation project cost and about $10,000 to each of the Laguna and Atoka-1 
Remediation projects. These costs were not budgeted for because I was under 
the assumption that new work orders would be issued for 1999, in which case, 
AFUDC costs would only be allocated based on 1999 spending charged to the new 
work orders. New work orders were not issued and the 1999 budgeted amount for 
the Thoreau Remediation of $78,000 can not possibly absorb the anticipated 
AFUDC costs. 

I will keep you posted of any further developments. Thanks, George

George,
This whole deal is still up in the air.  When I brought up the subject of 
AFUDC to Property Accounting, they started questioning whether these 
particular projects qualify to be "CAPITAL" at all.  I discussed the matter 
with Dan Pribble and he says to leave them as capital as long as I can but 
Property Accounting is going to want some real substantial justification 
before long for continuing to carry them in their arena.

And, if we end up having to dump a substantial portion of the total costs in 
all 5 of the current workorders to O&M, that will really kill the O&M budgets 
of the affected Teams.

So, don't do anything different from what you have been doing until we tell 
you different.

Thanks.

Another meeting was held with PG&E to discuss results of the latest sampling 
and construction activities on their system.  DAta from sampling has shown 
that PCB's are steadily increasing into further portions of the PG&E system.  
The latest sampling results showed positive hits on their mainline system at 
MP 63.26 where 4 oz. of liquids were removed from a siphon.  The analytical 
result of this liquid was 10 ppm.  PG&E and Southwest Gas are continuing 
their internal sampling efforts to identifiy additional places within their 
systems where PCB's may collect  and would be passed on to their customers.  
It should also be noted that  PG&E is and will be continuing their efforts of 
installing small filter separators at strategic interconnects to protect and 
remove PCBs from entering customer and LDC lines.

Annual emissions inventories were submitted to the TNRCC for the TW  Walton 
and NNG Seminole and Plainview C/S's

Title V air permits were receied from Region IX EPA for the Leupp and 
Klagetoh C/S's, which are on the Navajo Reservation.  A roles and 
responsibilities meeting was held with the Flagstaff Team for the Leupp Title

Solar is having problems tracking the information down.  It appears that the 
turbine was manufactured after 1977 (1989) and is subject to subpart GG, but 
I do not have confirmation of this information yet.  This turbine was 
installed at Keystone in 2000.  Did we do all the notifications and testing 
required by GG?  Do you know when the first turbine subject to GG was 
installed at Keystone?  We should be very careful about exchanging turbines 
that are not subject to GG.  We should try to get Solar to exchange pre 1977 
turbines with pre 1977 turbines.

Ms. Jensen,

The turbine power section serial #0921-97-P was installed at Keystone.  It
appears to be a 1997 model but can you confirm this through your Solar
contact.

IF there is no increase in emissions, this is probably not a modification
and the Grandfathered status would remain.  They would need to demonstrate
that there is no change.  This could require testing before and after the
change.

Larry- Thanks for the update. I am glad that the operating hours in the 
alternative scenario for BOTH STATIONS are agreeable to Transwestern. I will 
be sending the permits to EPA review today with a request for an expedited 
review.

The public notice period starts today, so i trust that the notice signs are 
posted outside your facilities.

Shudeish

Shudeish, the spreadsheets look great.  I spoke to the project engineer
about an hour ago and he told me that we can live with the numbers you have
given us in the permits for Stations 1 and 2 under the alternate operating
scenerio.  He has been in Boliva for the past 2 weeks and was unavailable
for comments.  Please accept my gratitude for all the extra work and effort
you have put in on this issue of operating hour under the alternative
operating scenerio.  We are going to accept the hours as stated in the
permits.  Thanks very much

pmorrison@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:


Dear Market Participants,

The NYISO is pleased to inform you about the following
enhancements to the MIS, OASIS and BAS that will be
implemented on May 29, 2001.

* Changes will be made to the Market Information System (MIS) to
make in-hour curtailment prioritization of transactions more
consistent with the BME scheduling process. Specific changes will
be made to:
- the NERC / ranked ordering,
- the addition of message for ICAP recall,
- the exclusion of Federal contracts from ICAP transactions
recalled, and
- the inclusion of exports from LBMP reference bus as ICAP
transactions.

* Also, for a transaction with an external source, the decremental
dollar will no longer be calculated. Please see Technical Bulletin
#61 for more information regarding transaction curtailments.

http://www.nyiso.com/services/documents/techbulletins/index.html

* Changes will also be made to the MIS to remove the $20,000 bias
from day ahead external transactions.

* New data will be posted to the NYISO OASIS web site to enhance
the presentation of real time data. The elements being added to
the web site include zonal real time (5 minute) load values and
zonal forecast load values. Consistent with a resolution passed by
the Business Issues Committee (BIC), zones J & K will be combined.

* The Shared Activation of Reserves (SAR) package on the real time
system will be enhanced to accommodate support for Hydro Quebec
(HQ) wheel-through transactions.

* The NYISO Day-ahead Price Responsive Load Program will be
implemented in both the MIS and the Billing and Accounting (BAS)
systems. The Day-ahead Price Responsive Load program offers
NYISO Customers the ability to supply a bid to the MIS indicating
the cost at which it will reduce its demand by a specified number
of MWs. The program will make use of the existing bidding and
scheduling web pages and upload / download templates.  However,
you must register for this program. Contact your Customer
Relations representative for details. Documents containing
instructions with more details will be issued soon.

* Other changes to the Billing & Accounting system (BAS) will
incorporate changes to the Daily Advisory Statements that will
provide additional columns of information on the Power Suppliers
section of the advisory. Also, new CSV reports will be provided
that give more detailed load information and static sub-zone
definition. More information will be provided soon about a
software tool to filter this new data.  It will be provided for
Market Participants whose automated data retrieval systems are not
prepared to receive the revised Daily Advisory statement.

Change #'s:
SWHE-4WQLHZ; KKIR-4WQLHE; VLEE-4WQQGL; RDEY-4WTLS6; DCUK-4WRGYU

If you notice any NYISO systems behave other than intended after
the scheduled implementation date, please let us know immediately.

It will be helpful if you refer to this notice if you communicate with
us about these changes.

Thank you,
Customer Relations

Dear Market Participants,

On Saturday May 12, 2001, the NYISO experienced higher than
normal LBMP's in real-time operation for those zones east of the
Central-East interface.
A scheduled maintenance outage of the Edic-New Scotland 345kV
transmission facility, in addition to unanticipated generating
resource outages, resulted in higher than normal congestion
associated with the Central-East interface.

NORTHERN NATURAL GAS COMPANY

Submitted Title V Permit Renewal for Mullinville Compressor to the KDHE.

Submittal of standard exemption documention for the NNG Kermit, Plainview, 
Seminole and Brownfield C/S's were submitted to the TNRCC.

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMAPNY

A conference call was held with Region IX EPA to discuss Redrock Expansion 
issues related to the issuance of Title V air permits for Sat. 3 and 4 which 
are on Indain lands.  The agency provided a tentative date of 7 weeks before 
the the permits would be issued.  The EPA has required Transwestern to 
respond to issues related to the Endangered Species Act prior to issuance of 
the air permit.  Transwestern is in the process of preparing a biological 
assessment for the properties within the facility fences of stations 3 and 4.

A meeting was held with the Arizona DEQ to discuss what activities 
Transwestern may participate in to assist the agency with the issuance of the 
air permits for Station 1 and 2.  The agency gave a date of April 2002 as a 
normal issue date.  Even under expidited conditions the date is expected to 
be mid December of this year.  Transwestern plans on actively pursuing ADEQ's 
management to determine if the date for issuance can be further decreased.  
On a side note, under the current Arizona regulations, certain construction 
activities can begin in leau of receiving the permit and include; foundation 
construction, laying underground piping and consturction of permenant 
underground structures. This wil benefit the inbitiation of the Redrock 
construction prior to receivng the air permits for these stations.

Larry,

Please give me a report following your fly-over of the route with Doug 
Cebryk.  I am very interested in what you see and the potentials that are 
there.  Don't forget to take your camera.  Pictures (slides) would be most 
helpful as we work through the early planning stages for the greenfield 
portion.  As the primary route begins to solidify with alternates, we will 
need to develop some preliminary maps.  It is my understanding that no maps 
of the route will be released with sign-off from the entire group of: Hyatt, 
Taylor, Veatch and Shafer.

After we receive the "fatal-flaw" desk-top analysis from ENSR (Sept. 21 - 
although I hope to get it sooner), I would offer that several events should 
be scheduled to expedite the project as follows:
1. If the open season reflects that we have a project and Eric Gadd approves, 
a couple of quick meetings will be held with strategic groups to discuss the 
project potential (TNC, State Land Managing agencies, US Forest Service, 
etc).  These strategic groups will be identified by the ENSR fatal-flaw 
analysis.
2. Simultaneously, we will begin working with ENSR (if the open season 
reflects that we have a project) on developing a full scoped Environmental 
Strategy for Sun Devil (this will include an RFP that will immediately go out 
soliciting bids for the Resource Reports and permits). 
3. We will work with Steve Veatch and Joe Hartso to schedule a meeting with 
the FERC Staff (we need the commitment of the State Land Managing Agencies, 
US Forest Service, etc. to collaborate with the FERC on the NEPA review) to 
introduce the project and solicit their commitment to offer staff resources 
early in the process.
4. We will also need to develop a Public Relations and Government Affairs 
strategy which will identify the early meetings that need to be held with 
local, state, federal jurisdictional governing bodies and politicians - so 
the right folks have a heads-up on the project before it hits the news 
media.  This also includes developing a strategy on where and when the 
project will formally be announced (i.e., news conference in Phoenix or 
Houston, etc.).  A $580 Million project will be a big deal in the Phoenix 
area and for the Southwest.

I know there is more, but this will help to keep some of the early events 
coordinated.  John Shafer

Scott, I made some minor changes, use if you wish.  Also, if you are going
to copy to someone in Harvey's organization, place his name and address at
the bottom of the letter.  Good job.

Bill as per your request, presented below is a status of the air permitting 
activity by the agencies as of today 11/01/01.

Stations 1 and 2. The EPA has completed is review of these state permits and 
has sent them back to the ADEQ for comment.  I have spoken to Shudeish, the 
permit engineer for the ADEQ, and he is reviewing EPA's comments as this e 
mail is being written.  He will give me a call when his review is complete, 
but he does not anticipate any major issues which cant be resolved prior to 
the public hearing.  These permits went out for public notice on October 15 
and 16, which means that the comment period ends on Nov. 15 and 16.  The ADEQ 
plans on holding the public hearing for both permits on monday Nov. 19 in 
Williams AZ. at 7:00 pm.  I plan on being there.  Williams is located approx. 
30 miles west of Flagstaff, AZ.  The address for the hearing is the Council 
Chambers located at 113 south 1st street.  So far, there have been no 
responses submitted to the ADEQ by the public.  In EPA's review process, 
they  had a problem with methodology proposed by Transwestern for measuring 
sulfur in the fuel gas.  We had proposed stain tubes in the custom fuel 
monitoring schedule, they wanted us to do wet chemistry.  We convinced them 
otherwise (Byron, because of this, you wont need to order a sulfur analyzer 
for the Needles facility.  This should save you about $40K).  There was also 
an issue with manufacturers quarantees regarding particulate matter emissions 
from the turbine and catepillar.  This has been resolved also.

Stations 3 and 4.  I received a call from Roger Kohn, the permit engineer for 
the EPA.  He is satisified with the permit application contents and has also 
approved stain tubes for the sulfur measurement at these locations.  There 
are no outstanding issues on these permits from the EPA.  The public comment 
period for the Station 3 and 4 permits ends Nov.  3.  After this date, it 
will take 1-2 weeks for the Regional Administrator of the EPA to sign off on 
the permits  and then he will have them issued to Transwestern.  As of this 
date, there have been no comments submitted to the EPA for the permits for 
station 3 and or 4.

Ill keep everyone apprised of future events.

TOP 10 WAYS TO BE THE FUNNIEST GUY IN YOUR OFFICE

10. Keep telling the same person they have bad breath
      even if they don't, and then punch them in the face.

  9. Announce in a meeting that you have AIDS. After
      everyone gives you the sympathy remarks, tell everyone
      you were kidding and call them a bunch of queers.

  8. Before a meeting, fill your mouth with custard. In the
     meeting pretend you're hocking up a loogie, spit it into
      a glass and hand it to the person next to you and say
      "BEAT THAT!"

  7. Inform a male co-worker that he would make a good
      hooker, then piss in his coffee and tell him he needs a
      good ass fucking.

   6. Always walk around with a big smile and keep one hand
       down the front of your pants.

   5. Answer every question with " Fucked if I know...",
       then call the person a racial slur that doesn't even match
       their race

   4. Brag about the fact that you carry a gun, and keep
       playing with your nuts. Get them really sweaty and go
       around shaking everyone's hand.

    3. Run down the hall with your dick out spraying piss
        everywhere yelling "It wont stop! God help me it wont
        stop!" Then when it does, look down and say, "Oh! I must have
        broke it."

     2. Ask to borrow a co-worker's expensive pen- Bring it
         to the bathroom and stick it up your ass- return it to
         the person and tell them that it smells bad and tell them to
         smell it- when they say that it smells, say "It should - - I
had it up
         my ass!"

     1. Shit on your office floor and when someone comes in
         and sees it tell them it's the fake rubber kind. When they try
         to pick it up and realize that their hand is full of real shit
- - laugh
         and embarrass him in front of everyone.

Bill Olson (OCD) has issued a letter, dated 8/19/99, approving TW's modified 
Groundwater Monitoring Plan and proposed Phase V Soil and Groundwater 
Assessment Plan. The modified monitoring plan will significantly reduce the 
routine groundwater sampling costs; from about $75,000 per year to $20,000 
per year. The Phase V assessment plan is relatively limited in scope. The 
plan includes the installation and sampling of three additional off-site 
wells into the uppermost aquifer. These activities will be on hold pending 
obtaining off-site access; either by means of a property exchange, business 
lease, or water development easement.

Presented Title V training to the Flagstaff Team.  The training included 
responsibilities, recordkeeping and semi annual reporting requirements.

A meeting was held with representatives of Transwestern and PG&E to discuss 
activities related to removing PCB's from the Topock Lateral.  Sampling data 
was reviewed and discussions were held addressing past cleaning efforts.

decreased weekly until PCB concentrations fall below 5 ppm.  Transwestern 
will be implementing a pipeline cleaning of the remaining 1850 of pipe

Bill-
Two files are attached. The first file is the text and figures of a plan for 
characterizing impacted soil in the former surface impoundment areas. The 
second file contains the attachments to the characterization plan. The 
attachments include copies of soil boring logs and a summary of some previous 
soil sample results. I will also send two hard copies of the plan to you via 
FedEx. Transwestern is ready to proceed upon approval from the NMOCD and the 
NMED HRMB. Please call me if you have any questions or comments.
Thanks,
George

First Aid Tips
In a medical emergency, knowing what to do can make all the difference.
Here are some tips to help you handle an unexpected injury or illness:
* In the event of decapitation, sit the victim's body in a chair
as best you can, balance the head on top of the shoulders, and walk away
whistling nonchalantly.
* Always keep plenty of gauze around the house in case you invent
an invisibility potion.
* If you did all you could and the victim still dies, pat him or
her down for a Snickers bar. It's not like you don't deserve one.
* Nothing revives a stroke victim like an eye-popping orgasm.
* If someone you know is seriously injured, cradle his or her head
in your lap and scream, "Why?"
* Administering CPR is easy. Just do it like you saw them do on TV
that one time.
* In the event of accidental drug overdose, call Lou Reed
immediately.
* To stop a nosebleed, apply pressure. To start a nosebleed, apply
even greater pressure in short, repeated bursts.
* If a person requires artificial respiration, and you are of the
same sex as the person, and no one of the opposite sex is around to
perform the procedure, you are gay.
* If the Heimlich maneuver is ineffective on a choking victim,
grab his or her neck and squeeze downward to force the food into the
stomach. If this fails, grab the victim's ankles and swing him or her
around in a circle to force the food up.
* Make sure your first-aid kid contains a large, frilly Victorian
fan to revive fainting victims.
* If you are a hideous, disfigured hunchback and you see someone
who is injured and unconscious, treat the person. Then, as the person
begins to wake up, retreat into hiding. The person will always wonder
who saved him or her, and the experience will be poignant in a
bittersweet way.
* As a rule of thumb, always ask yourself this question: What
would Randolph Mantooth do?
* If possible, try to be the guy who tells the victim,
"Everything's going to be all right," while others do the actual work.

Dear Larry,
?
The electronic copies of the Transwestern  Compressor stations reports 
completed by Statistical Research are attached as  PDF files. The reports are 
considered to be drafts and we look foward to  receiving reviewers comments. 
There are three PDF files:
?
transwest1 which contains the report for compressor  station 1;
?
transwest1_sitecard which contains the ASM site  card for the site recorded 
at compressor station 1 and;
?
transwest2 which contains the report for compressor  station 2.
?
I have also FedExed a hard copy of these documents  to Bret Fritch for AM 
delivery tomorrow.

I was at a TXOGA meeting last week and I was informed that TNRCC is only 
receiving a small percentage of the Title V Compliance Certification forms 
that they are supposed to be receiving from companies with Title V operating 
permits. Remember that Compliance Certification forms are due in Texas 30 
days after the anniversary of the date your operating permit was issued. 
TNRCC is not notifying companies that the forms are not being received. If 
you need the forms you can obtain them from TNRCC's web site at:

http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/air/opd/formswp.htm#compl

They are under the "Compliance and Reporting Form" section. Deviation Forms 
(for reporting noncompliance with federally enforceable regulations) can also 
be obtained at this location.

As a result of the latest meeting with PG&E over the greater than 500 ppm PCB 
liquids collection at the PGE Topock C/S filter separator (F/S), presented 
below is a summary of the deconning and sampling activity which occurred 
6/29/00.

Vector was instructed to use a high caustic detergent (Cimclean) as the 
cleaning agent for removing PCB's from the Topock F/S (50:50 Cimclean:water 
mixture).  Diesel was not used in the deconning process.  The only equipment 
cleaned by Vector was the PG&E F/S.  Transwestern's filters in its separator 
were replaced,  but no cleaning or deconning was perfromed to this unit.   
The filters were also replaced in the PG&E separator.

The following samples were collected during this project:

On the Transwestern side:

 1. Wipes (3) of the interrior body of our filter separator after the filters 
were removed.  Large areas were wiped to determine presence/absence of   
PCB's.  (Not 100 sq. cm. sample)

 2. A composite sample of a used filter removed from the upstream separator 
at the Selexol Plant.  The filters appeared to be exceptionally clean 

 3. Composite sample of the fine powdery rust  which had collected in the 
bottom of the F/S.   Approximte volume one cup.  
 
 4. Composite sample of the used filters from the F/S. Visible appearance of 
the filters removed from this vessel showed them to be clean and    virtually 
unstained.  A small discoloration was present on the ends of each filter 
confirming that the filters were sealed properly in the F/S. 

 5. A sample of an unused clean stocked filter.  This was a control sample. 


On the PG&E side:

 1. A liquids sample of the residual in the upstream leg of the Topock filter 
separator prior to deconning.  Approx. volume one cup

 2. Sample of the solids (fine, blackened, powder) which had collected in the 
F/S.  An estimate of the volume of this material removed form the F/S   prior 
to deconning was approximately one gallon.

 3. Wipe samples (3) of the interrior of the F/S prior to deconning (not 100 
cm sq. wipe)

 4. Used filter media from the F/S.  The operation of the F/S filters are 
designed to be a twice pass through of the same filter.  Composite samples   
were collected of the upstream and downstream portions of the filters.

 5. Wipes (3) of the deconned filter separator interrior walls. 

The only inconsistency observed during the cleaning and inspection process 
was the volume and  buildup of the black fine powdery hydrcarbon material 
which was present in the F/S at the Topock C/S and conspicuously small amount 
of rust colored material which was present  in Transwestern's F/S .  As 
previously mentioned, samples were collected of  both materials.  The only 
difference between the two locations was the color of the materials and the 
volume.  It is suspected that the deconning activity conducted in August of 
99 loosened hydrocarbon solids present in the 1850 feet of pipe which had 
over time moved and collected in the PG&E F/S.  The small amount of rust 
materials observed in the Transwestern F/S is the result of the pigging 
activity from the Selexol Plant into the Transwestern F/S.  I will have 
reprensentataive samples of both materials.  

Photographs  were also taken of the cleaning and inspection activities and 
will be available for review at the forthcoming meeting in Flagstaff with 
PG&E.
on the 13th of July.  Analytical results will also be completed at this time.

Here are the individual plot plans for 1 and 2.



M3-1A.dwg & .tif are the station 1 plot plans. M3-1B.dwg & .tif are the 
station 2 plot plans. The files need to be placed in the same directory. You 
would open the .dwg file in Autocad and it will bring in the related .tif to 
complete the drawing.

Thanks

Transmission Scenarios for MDEA

What would the following procedures be for MDEA=01,s network services.

1. Buying megawatts from the market and bringing in from outside of Entergy=
.
a. Ex.  AEP-TVA-EES-MDEA
For day-ahead (or earlier), put in a network request (designated resources)=
=20
on the Entergy OASIS, POR=3DTVA, POD=3DEES, SOURCE=3DAEP, SINK=3DMDEA, BID =
PRICE =3D=20
$0.0.  The request will be subject to interface availability and will be=20
evaluated by Entergy accordingly.

2. Buying megawatts from the market inside of Entergy. =20
a. Ex.  Lagen- MDEA
For day-ahead (or earlier), put in a network request (designated resources)=
=20
on the Entergy OASIS, POR=3DLAGN, POD=3DEES, SOURCE=3D(LAGN UNIT NAME), SIN=
K=3DMDEA,=20
BID PRICE =3D $0.0.  The request will be subject to availability and will b=
e=20
evaluated by Entergy accordingly. (If the source is an Entergy unit (or AXI=
A)=20
use POR=3DEES.=20

3. Using the network services request number for the Sepa contract when Sep=
a=20
is not flowing and we can bring MGW=01,s in from the Tva border.
a. Ex.  We find 11 MGW=01,s  LGE-TVA-EES-MDEA.
For day-ahead (or earlier), put in a network request (designated resources)=
=20
on the Entergy OASIS, POR=3DTVA, POD=3DMDEA, SOURCE=3DLGE, SINK=3DMDEA, BID=
 PRICE =3D=20
$0.0. Put a comment in the request that states this request is modifying=20
(displacing) the existing request (SEPA; OASIS #851472). - I need to clarif=
y=20
this with Entergy but this is the approach I recommend.

NOTE: When scheduling on the above requests, the transmission is considered=
=20
F-7 priority level. When you want to schedule intra-day (hourly), you must=
=20
request non-firm (import for Native/NST loads. This type of transmission is=
=20
NN-6 priority level.
Remember - all bid prices are $0.0 because MDEA is charged by their load=20
share ratio.

This is all of the scenarios that I can think of that may cause a problem. =
 I=20
just want to make sure that everyone is on the same page especially with=20

This is to let you know where we are on your proposed settlement agreement.
TEPI's SH&E staff advises me that  the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division
("OCD") has required revisions to TEPI's remediation plan for this site.  We
are reluctant to submit to you a revised draft of the settlement agreement
until that remediation plan is finalized with the OCD in about October. At
that time we will get Enron a redraft.

I have reviewed your last draft and have a few conceptual items I would like
to mention to you , bearing in mind that I have not participated in earlier
discussions or drafts:

(1) I notice that the proposed agreement requires TEPI to remediate the site
and to reimburse Northern for all out of pocket expenses for investigation,
assessment ,remediation and monitoring  this site, if TEPI is the source of
contamination--- but that Northern is only required to reimburse TEPI for
its part of the environmental assessment if Northern is found to be the
source. I would think that these provisions should be bilateral and that the
settlement agreement should also provide that if Northern is at fault, it
would remediate the site, as well as reimburse TEPI for all of the same out
of pocket  expenses.

(2) How does Enron/Northern feel about submitting this dispute to binding
AAA arbitration in Houston,  if the parties cannot agree on the source of
the contamination after TEPI conducts the environmental assessment, with the
arbitrators empowered to allocate costs if they determine that both parties
contributed to the contamination?  If arbitration is agreeable, I will
prepare an arbitration provision for our next draft.

(3) I am inclined to have the agreement interpreted under Texas law, rather
than New Mexico's,  since both companies have large presences in Texas , but
do not feel strongly about it.

Let me know your thoughts on these matters when you have a chance.

April 20, 2001

To Market Participants:

On April 24, 2001, the NYISO will premier its

? new website design. The visual
presentation of the site is
being refreshed to convey a bold presence on the Internet and present a clear,
consistent, hi-tech look and
feel to the site. This represents the completion of phase I of the web refresh
project and is part of the
NYISO Strategic Initiatives.

For a period of two weeks (until May 8, 2001), both the new and old websites
will be operated in parallel.
On May 8, 2001 (unless notified differently), the old site will be 
discontinued.
The NYISO has planned
the transition to be as seamless as possible for our Market Participants and
Guests.

Several paths are available to access the new site. Direct links will be 
placed
on the NYISO home page
and on the What?s New page under Hot Topics. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE BOOKMARKS OR
SCRIPT FILES!!!!!!!!!!!! Once the transition period is ended, the NYISO will
rename the server
containing the new website to the address of the old website. With this plan,
Users will NOT be required
to modify bookmarks and/or script files.

The URL addresses for the MIS portion of the web site, the billing statements,
and the LBMP data HAVE
NOT and WILL NOT change. Access to these areas of the site will not change and
Users will not need to
modify any procedures.

What Users can expect to see is consistent fonts, style rules, symbols, 
colors,
etc. This will enhance
navigation and improve the functionality of the site. Phase II of this project
will address site architecture,
file structure, and make substantial improvements to site navigation and data
content. Information
gathered from onsite interviews with Market Participants from each sector will
be used in the
implementation of Phase II changes.

Market Participants should contact their Customer Relations Representative if
they have any questions,
comments, concerns, and/or problems. All others may contact Customer Relations
at (518) 356-6060.

Thank You
The Web Refresh Team

Larry here is the list.  We have 2 additions on the bottom.  This is the

I made out the Tier 2 reports for these tanks and sent them to the proper

* =01;The permitting timeline=01;being used=01;was based on historical=20
timelines=01;encountered=01;while processing prior Arizona projects.=01; No=

applications for Station 1 and 2 has stated that he is overloaded and worki=

=20
AZ DEQ is that we would be willing to pay for a third-party contractor to=
=20
take the permits and work them up=01;for release to the publishing firm so =
they=20

juncture to be able to get our applications moved up in the que, typed, and=
=20
out for public comment; but EPA Region IX will still have thirty days after=
=20

level and get the meeting set.=01; It's one thing to pressure the State of=
=20
Arizona and get a permit applications moving; but if we are not very carefu=
l=20
with Region IX we could damage our ability to not only get Sun Devil's=20
permits, but create audits and compliance situations that are far reaching.=
=01;=20
Again, we must first get a personal meeting with them=01;to enable us to=20
present=01;the need, circumstances, and how long these permits have already=
 been=20
on file.=01; Locating the=01;correct person to help us do that is of upmost=
=20
importance!
* Clarifying the complicated point, EPA Region IX has responsibility=20
to=01;review and publish not only the permits for Stations 3 and 4, but to =
also=20
review the AZ DEQ permits for stations 1 and=01;2 for 30 days.=01; Therefor=

Mr. Stewart, as per your voice mail request on Feb. 20, 2001, attached find 
the correspondance relating to the request of replacing the existing mixing 
valves with carburetors at the Northern Natural Gas, Spraberry Plant.  In 
this discussion, Jon Fields of Argent Consulting was involved.  I have 
attached for your review the letter requests from Northern to you and the 
e-mails which were traded back and forth from yourself and Argent.  The 
results of the pre testing emissions with the mixing valves on and the post 
testing of the emissions with the carburetors on were mailed to you on Jan. 
20, 2001.  The testing results were compiled in hard copy form and are not 
included with this submittal, but can be resubmitted if requested.  Your 
favorable request in this replacement activity is requested.

Hi Jon,
This is a joint Duncan - Jim Linville reply.
First, for all intents and purposes, expect GF status to go away when the
legislature comes back to town.  With that in mind, what exactly is
happening with this engine.  Does the carburetor replace the mixer valves?
 If so, this must be one ancient engine!  And unlikely to get in under VERP
or any other program designed to end GF status.  Tell us more.

Duncan,
I have some grandfathered gas compressor engines in west Texas.  We are
going to change out the old mixer valves and install carburetors on the
units as a maintenance activity.  Horsepower and emissions will not
increase.  I can maintain my grandfathered status, correct?  We will of
course document this activity and provide copies to the regional office.
Thanks,
Jon Fields

Jon, Here's the latest comment from Jim:
don't see why a test before the change and after the change using the same
analyzer would not demonstrate no increase in emissions.

Duncan,
Ok.  We'll test an engine.  This project involves 5 identical engines.  We
want to test just one - will you accept that?  Will you accept portable
analyzer test results?  These analyzers have been certified by the state of
New Mexico to be plus/minus 3% from full trailer tests.
Thanks,

IF there is no increase in emissions, this is probably not a modification
and the Grandfathered status would remain.  They would need to demonstrate
that there is no change.  This could require testing before and after the
change.

Dear Larry,

I have talked to Kent Rylander, our ornithologist, about the bird nest, and
he expressed the opinion that it was either a Swainson's hawk or a
roadrunner.  I have adjusted the report appropriately.  Are there other
issues or does the attached report meet your needs?

The year-end performance evaluation process is a great opportunity for=20

(Note: ETS employees on self-directed work teams that participate in the=20

they have in the past and are exempted from the discussion that follows.)

Feedback and Evaluation
Employees will solicit 360=15 feedback on their performance via the PEP sys=

The supervisor will use this feedback, along with other performance data=20
about the employee, to prepare a written evaluation of the employee=01,s=20
performance for the year.  The employee and supervisor will then meet and=

discuss this evaluation which provides an objective measure of the employee=

performance against expectations.  The performance evaluation is an=20
opportunity to discuss accomplishments, areas for improvement and goals for=
=20
the next year.  No overall performance rating will be designated.

? PEP System open for feedback   November 19 - December 7
? Performance discussions with supervisor December 10 - January 14

Compensation
Increases in an employee=01,s base pay for merit, promotion or equity can b=

Relative Talent Reviews
Relative talent reviews will occur beginning January 16, 2002 and will=20

to 3:00 p.m. at the Holiday Inn in Holyoke, MA.  The meeting's agenda
consists of two items, both of which involve MR 17: (1) Transmission
Congestion Compensation and (2) Structural Screen for OP-4 (bid cap) type of
conditions.

Attached is a file containing two exhibits that provide congestion
information that, hopefully, will aid in the group's discussion on the first
item.  With respect to the second item, we will forward to you any materials
we receive.  If you can not make the meeting in person we have arranged for
a conference call.  The dial-in number is as follows:

Roger, I printed the Calpine permits and everything worked fine.  Am
looking forward to seeing my permits.  Any idea as to when they will be
placed on the EPA website?  The reason I ask is that I need to travel to
Flagstaff Az and cant go untill I make copies of  the Sta 3 and 4 permit
drafts. Roswell to Flagstaff is 500 miles.
Whatever you can do will really help.

Larry,

Actually, I'm going to post the draft permits and SOBs on our website.  I
think you'll have everything you need there.  If for some reason you don't
like the way that looks or prints, I will send you files.  To see an
example, go to:  http://www.epa.gov/region09/air/permit/epssdata.htm

Then click the first yellow bullet and drill down through CA and Monterey
and click on Calpine.  At the bottom of the form you will see yellow icons.
Click on the one in the field labeled "link permit conditions".

I will fax you our cover letter as soon as it's signed today.  Please
e-mail me your fax number.  Thanks.

"Depillo, Raymond V." <Raymond.Depillo@pseg.com> writes to the 
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Certainly the problem Don identified is legitimate and can still occur.
However, with the implementation of the ECAs we have seen a change in
bidding behavior at the interfaces - HAMs no longer bid at or near the caps.
Thus, by changing HAM prices of accepted DAM transactions to something like
+/- $500, you can be reasonably sure your transaction will flow.  If it
doesn't you may be far better off that it didn't.

The big concern I have with this is that it can again lead to huge
scheduling problems with neighboring control areas (once DAMs and HAMs are
all competing for the same space).  How is the ISO planning on better
coordinating with its neighbors - will lead times on accepted transactions
change?  Does the ISO have any comments?  Do we remember the letters that
were received from PJM - and can we afford scheduling snafus going into the
summer?

Attached are a clean and blacklined revised version of Attachment J to the
proposed ICAP Manual that will come before BIC on May 24. The Attachment J
circulated last week had some glitches in it. This Attachment J has been
blacklined against the one circulated last week so you can readily see the
differences.

I apologize for any inconvenience.

As a reminder, the state of Texas requires releases of natural gas greater 
than 119 mscf  to the atmosphere (in a 24 hour period), to be reported to the 
Regional Offices of the TNRCC.  These releases include but may not be limited 
to the following:  ESD's, startups, shutdowns, pipeline ruptures and 
maintenance activities.  Should any of the above activities release natural 
gas in excess of 119 mscf, a written notification should be faxed to the 
Regional Office of the TNRCC  within the following timeframes:

 Unanticipated Upsets- within 24 hours after the discovery of the upset. 

 Maintenance, Startup or Shutdowns- 10 day prior to the expected exceedance.

This reminder is being sent to all ET&S teams within Texas because in the 
last two Northern Natural Gas compressor station inspections conducted by the 
TNRCC,  they specifically requested backup data and reporting documentation 
of the natural gas releases to the atmosphere which were greater than 119 
mscf.  The agency's  inquiry specifically addressed knowledge of compressor 
station venting for ESD, start ups and shutdowns.

It should also be mentioned that there has been inconsistencies in the 
TNRCC's position regarding this issue.  However, until a position has been

The Credit Policy Working Group, which has been assigned by the Budget,
Standards, and Performance Subcommittee to address the details necessary to
develop a NYISO Credit Policy, I believe is converging on a proposal that I
expect will be drafted and available from NYISO staff by May 18.  Since the
BSP has been assigned by the Management Committee to recommend a credit
policy, the full BSP needs to review this proposal and attempt to reach a
consensus position to recommend to the Management Committee at its June 6
meeting.  Absent that, we need to able to present majority and minority
proposals.

In anticipation of this proposal being available May 18, and consistent
with the goal of presenting a recommendation to the Management Committee
for a vote at its June 6 meeting, I am scheduling two BSP meetings (in
addition to the May 21 which is to address business planning goals).

The first meeting will be Tuesday, May 22, 2001, starting at 9:30 AM in
Conference Room "WA" at the NYISO offices on Washington Avenue Extension in
Albany.  You are encouraged to participate in person since NYISO staff will
be presenting the details of the proposal, however, the following call-in
number is available for those who cannot be there:

Dial In Number:          (505) 242-2420

Participant Code:   265727

A second meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, May 30, 2001, starting at 9:30
AM in Conference Room "WA" at the NYISO offices on Washington Avenue
Extension in Albany to finalize our recommendation(s) to Management
Committee.  (If we can achieve this on May 22, this meeting will not be
needed.  I've been at this too long, however, to expect that will be the
case.)  Again, in person attendance is preferred, however, the following
call-in number will be available.  Same number as the first meeting:

Dial In Number:          (505) 242-2420

Participant Code:   265727

"Roy J. Shanker" <royjshanker@worldnet.att.net> writes to the 
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

I agree with Mark. Further, in setting the baseline, the LOLP study
obviously assumed an annual structure for maintenance scheduling and a lack
of diversity in terms of outage rates for summer versus winter. These
assumptions no longer are valid if the time step for planning becomes a
capability period. Each reliability period would have to stand on its own,
and you would have to entirely redo the assumptions about scheduled outages
and come up with seasonal availabilities. My guess is that given the
incentive to be around in the summer for the higher energy payments, these
values should be highly skewed.

Finally, lets also just cut to the chase. Even if this study were correct in
its current form, what obviously is going on is an attempt to "evade" 50% of
the deficiency charge. Applying this type of argument on seasonal installed
requirement to deficiency payments just doesn't fly. If you believe that the
current values for the deficiency payments are "correct" to begin with, it
would make sense to me to at minimum allocate the deficiency charges by the
LOLP incurrence, e.g. if 90% of the annual LOLP is in the summer period,
then 90% of the deficiency should probably follow this allocation. Remember,
the incentive is to force people to build, the cost of being short ever
really should stay the same, or you diminish the incentive and thus undercut
the entire reliability structure.

How do you get from an initial estimate of "75% and 92% of the summer peak
load ... for NYC and LI, respectively" to "having an ICAP requirement for
summer and winter seasons based on the LSE's peak load for the respective
season would send the proper ICAP price signal."   The summer and winter
ICAP requirements are based upon the summer peak load.  Basing the winter
ICAP requirement on the winter peak load would be a substantial change in
the ICAP market.  If we are going to consider a change in this direction
then we also have to apply most of the annual deficiency rate to the summer
period.

<< File: NYPA_LR_wint.PDF >>  << File: TRAN_SYS_001129.PDF >>          At
NYPA's
request ISO staff conducted a limited analysis of
the winter locational ICAP requirements for Long Island and New York City
areas.  While such ICAP requirements have historically been set as a single
number for the entire year, it is NYPA's belief that this holdover from the
old way of doing business must be re-examined.  It is NYPA's belief that
most if not all of the contribution to loss of load risk occurs in the
summer months.  As such, some reduction in winter ICAP requirements should
be possible with no impact on the Loss of Load criterion of one day in ten
years.

NYPA requested that the ISO start with the database that
resulted in the
locational requirements of 80% and 98% for New York City and Long Island,
respectively.   At NYPA's request the ISO modeled winter ratings on the
transmission interfaces into NYC and LI and determined how much the 80% and
98% could be reduced in the winter before any impact on the statewide Loss
Of Load  occurred.  The report indicates that winter requirements of 75% and
92% of the summer peak load resulted for NYC and LI, respectively.

While this in no way reflects an exhaustive analysis of winter
locational
requirements, the results from this study suggest that some reduction in the
winter  requirement may be warranted and a consideration of seasonal
requirements should be incorporated in future ICAP requirement studies.
NYPA believes that having an ICAP requirement for summer and winter seasons
based on the LSE's peak load for the respective season would send the proper
ICAP price signal.


NYPA is sharing the study results in the attached report in
an effort to
begin a dialog which we hope will lead to a broader examination of
locational requirements when the issue is revisited again next year.  We
would appreciate hearing the views of other market participants.

The recovery system continues to produce too much water in spite of using 
product skimmers attached to the pumps. The problem is that product is 
forming an emulsion with water and the emulsion is recovered by the skimmers. 
Unfortunately the emulsion is more water than product. I believe this problem 
can be eliminated by using a different type of pump. The current pump system, 
manufactured by Marshalk, uses air to displace the product from the pump. We 
have been using a bladder pump fitted with a skimmer attachment, manufactured 
by Clean Environment Equipment, at Bell Lake and at Ivanhoe with very good 
success (and no emulsion problems). I have ordered three replacement pumps 
and skimmers (CEE GNE-24) to replace the three Marshalk pumps. I will have 
Clayton shut-down the recovery system until we can install the replacement 
pumps. This should take about 3-4 weeks.

On a related note, I spoke to Vector concerning the equipment which was 
suggested for cleaning on the PG&E system.  It is as follows:

 2 scrubbers, some underground C/S piping, filter separator, horizontal tank, 
2-10.84 drip locations

The Vector proposal for mobilization, demobilizataion and cleaning the above 
PG&E equipment will be approx. $ 75, 000.  

I approached Vector about the pipeline cleaning between our M/S and their 
C/S.  They quoted a turn key price of $34,000.  Because this piping belongs 
to Transwestern, we should contract this cleaning ourselves.  If the decision 
is made to address this cleaning, I think we would want to have it done 
during the same time period as the PG&E cleaning activities.  I will also 
need some lead time to notify Vector and determine an appropriate methodology 
to be used.  Vector apparently has an approved methodology for cleaning pipes 
to 36".  

One additional note, apparently PG&E has discovered PCBs in their gas 
compressors.  In wipe samples taken of the internal compressors PCBs were 
found at regulated levels.....

Some feed back so far...... There appears to be a problem brewing with the
planned implementation of the May 29 adjustment that removes the $20K bias 
from
the DAM external transactions.I am awaiting a call back on my concerns from 
the
NYISO. By occasionally settling hourly prices through BME or occasionally
settling after SCD sets RT prices, depending on the extistence or non 
existence
of congestion, a problem that we thought we fixed many months ago will 
reappear
with the removal of the $20K bias.Here is an example of my musings....

DAM bid gets accepted at  $50 ( Import from PJM)  .....  BME  then runs (No
constraints)  evaluating the import HAM bids and other items that have
BMEprovide a $40 price.... DAM gets cut  , looks like  a $10 profit  ( 
providing
your loss in PJM doesn't exceed $10) . Due to in hour operations the RT price
clears at $60. You loooooooose!!  Sound familiar? After getting beat up like
this the MP's went through the committee structure and had the $20,000 adder
used for DAM (except IS+) to protect against this. The clearing at BME for all
external  proxy busses removed the problem so the $20,000 adder was removed. 
Now
the external interfaces only clear at BME if they are constrained. Are we 
taking
a huge step back on purpose or was there a mistake in implementation?

John, Lou, Cutty, Bill, I want to bring this issue back up for your 
attention, as I know that everyone is very busy.  During the EPA Title V 
inspection at the Laguna C/S this past week, Barbara Bernacek, the Laguna 
environmental person was present.  She had been asked to be there by the 
EPA.  During our tour of the facility, she casually asked if any progress or 
decision had been made by Enron management towards remediation assistance in 
the groundwater issue at the Laguna C/S.  I had informed her that we were 
still actively discussing this issue and would contact her in the near future 
concerning management's decision.  I would appreciate it very much if each of 
you would revisit my memo below and  then lets discuss what should be done 
and the approach we should take in addressing the Laguna's concern about a 
proactive approach to reaching cleanup and closure.

Subject: Meeting with the Laguna's over the PCB remediation at C/S 6

I wanted to present this summary of the meeting Transwestern had with 
representatives of the Laguna Pueblo concerning the status of the PCB 
remediation activities by TW.  On the Laguna side were members of the Laguna 
pueblo, the PEOP a  technical oversight group that provides expertise and 
assistance on technical issues for all of the 19 pueblos in New Mexico 
(ranging from UST to superfund), and members of ETS ( 5 members of the Laguna 
team, Butch Russell, Rick Smith  (advisor for the Laguna team), myself)  and 
George Robinson.   This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a 
half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest 
in environmental activities on their pueblo.

The meeting centered around two issues at the site: the closure of the UST 
and the PCB remediation activity.  With respect to the first, concensus was 
reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples 
at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis, 
and send the results to POEP for review. 

With repsect to the PCB remediation issue, things were a little different.  
The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal 
Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is 
presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals 
toward  achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the 
Lagunas have verified this.  They indicated that that have been patient with 
Transwstern's attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB 
contamination, but based upon the historic sampling results, that this 
technology is not proving to be very successful, in fact the results have 
shown stagnant results  (Im using their words).  They would like to see 
Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup 
and closure of this site.   Members of the Laguna pueblo, who work for the 
POEP,  expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact 
future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of 
Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their 
lands.   One member of the Laguna pueblo called the contamination a "cancer"  
with potential to spread.   A comment was made by the POEP that there was a 
major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination 
if we continue to just maintain  our present approach of just monitoring the 
site and installing additional wells..

A member of the POEP has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from 
North Dakota State University, (Energy and Environmental Research Center) who 
claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered 
difficult to remediate (this site would certainly fall into this category due 
to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and 
channels present which direct  the PCB containing liquids present at the 
site).  Although the POEP was not recommending Transwestern utilize their 
service, they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site 
with them.

It shold also be mentioned that Syed Risvi, the POEP Superfund representative 
was at this meeting.  He had mentioned that the  POEP has been in discussions 
with EPA Region VI concerning potential classification of the site on the 
CERCLIS list of sites for inclusion on the NPL..  He had indicated that he 
did not want to see this site included on the list, but stated that 
Transwetern needed to update and show postive results in our remediation 
efforts and that it was the tribal councils opinion that this was not being 
done.

At the conclusion of the meeting, I informed the POEP that Transwestern's 
internal remediation group  would contact the NDSU group and discuss the site 
characteristics with them and we would reprot back to them the results of our 
discussions.  This seemed to satisify the  POEP and they were content with 
this. 

John, I would like to schedule a conference call with the above list of 
people and discuss this issue.  A couple of things I want to bring out.  
First, we will be undergoing ROW and Compressor Station renewals with the 
Lagunas in the near future.  Second, on the Laguna tribal lands, they have 
experienced other releases of contimation and are currently very sensitive to 
this whole  contamination problem.  Although we are considered by the POEP as 
proactive up to this point  and very easy to work with (direct quote from the 
POEP)   they are wanting a more proactive and measurable effort from 
Transwestern to clean up the PCBs. 
Please get back with me on this.

I want to bring interrested parties up to date on the issue of replacing the 
fuel mixers with carbuerators at  the Spraberry Plant.  It seems that this 
replacement was performed ONLY as a fuel savings activity and that there 
would be no increase in emissions or horsepower as a result.  According to 
the TNRCC, they will allow this activity provided that the above is true and 
that we prove that emissions and horsepower will not increase.  To do this 
they have requested that we conduct an emissions test on one of the units 
with the mixer on and then with the carbuerator on as a condition of their 
approval.  IE before and after testing.  I am going to request that we be 
allowed to do the testing with a portable emissions tester, which has been 
verified in side by side testing on New Mexico units as opposed to bringing 
in a third party referenced testing company.  Contractor testing runs about 
$3-5,000.  

A condition of all permitting issues is that the carbs are not supposed to be 
installed on the units (preconstruction) until approval has been given by the 
agency.  In this case, we will be allowed to install a carbuerator on the one 
unit to be tested but not on all units.  Should testing show other 
exceedances (emissions or Hp) in addition to fuel savings, this will trigger 
actions requiring perimtting.  Under the circumstances, I think it would be 
in the best interest of NNG to know for certain that we have not violated the 
grandfather status of the units and that if our activity requires permitting, 
we comply immediately.

I am sending out the letter request to the TNRCC today.  If approved, we 
should test ASAP.  Remember, that sampling ports in the exhaust stack of the 
unit to be tested will need to be constructed prior to testing.  Let me know 
if the Team will need a diagram showing the sampling port locations.

Particpated in the EPA NFL spill release and discharge data request for the 
Midland Region.

A meeting was held with the New Mexico Environment Department, Air Quality 
Bureau concerning the NOV for the P-1 C/S.  Transwestern presented letters 
from the AQB to Transwestern which apparently had not been reviewed by the 
AQB prior to issuance of the NOV.  The AQB requested a delay to re evaluate 
the new evidence which had been given to them.  They indicated that they 
would be contacting us after they had reviewed this new data and information.

Dear Datek Online Customer,

The equity in your account has fallen below margin maintenance
requirements, creating a Margin Maintenance Call (or "House Call") as of
November 8, 2000.

Amount Due: The house call is for $ 1836

Date Due: This call is due by the close of business on Monday, November
13, which will be Day 3 of the house call.

Please be aware that Friday, November 10, 2000 is a bank holiday.  Banks
will not be open to wire transfer funds.  If you plan on funding your
account to meet your margin call, please wire funds to Datek Online
prior to Friday.  Once you have wired your funds remember to have your
bank provide you with a wire receipt containing a federal reference
number.

Datek Online only accepts a faxed copy of the wire receipt including the
federal reference number as proof of funds forthcoming.  Please fax your
wire receipt to 732-744-9143.

If you choose to overnight a check to Datek Online, please confirm with
the carrier that they will be delivering on Friday.  U.S. Post Offices
will not open and will not be delivering mail on Friday November 10,
2000.

The call requirements can be satisfied by:

1.  Depositing sufficient funds into your account to satisfy the entire
amount of the call.
2.  Selling sufficient securities in your account to satisfy the entire
amount of the call.
3.  The market value of your portfolio appreciating above equity
requirements.

What you should do:

A margin call requires you keep a watchful eye on the value of your
portfolio.  Be mindful of market fluctuations in your portfolio and how
they affect your account.  A margin call is payable on demand, and
rapidly depreciating market conditions may require immediate action
involving liquidation of sufficient securities in your account to
satisfy the call without further notice from us to you.  Taking the
necessary steps to satisfy the house call can avoid this.

This margin call must be satisfied by the close of the market on Monday,
November 13.  You should immediately decide which call payment method is
best for you.  Do not delay in satisfying the call.  Please take
immediate action to satisfy this call prior to the close of the market
on Monday, November 13, 2000-DAY 3. If your account does not meet margin
equity requirements as of the market open on November 14-DAY 4 we will
be forced to take action to satisfy the call by selling some or all of
your portfolio.

Sending Additional Funds to Meet Your Margin Call

The amount stated above is the amount of the call that may be met by
depositing additional funds (cash) into your account.   The fastest way
to deposit funds is to send a wire.

If you choose to wire funds you must:

1.   Fax a copy of the wire receipt
2.   Include the federal reference number of the wire
3.   Fax to 732-744-9143

Important Note
Datek Online only accepts a faxed copy of the wire receipt including the
federal reference number as proof of funds forthcoming.


If you choose to send a check by overnight mail you must:

1.   Include your UserName and account number on your check
2.   Mail to:
Datek Online
Attn: Cashiering Department - Margin Call
100 Wood Avenue South
Iselin, NJ 08830-2716

Important Notes:

? We do not accept an air bill number, a copy of a check or phone or
email confirmations as proof of funds forthcoming.
? We must receive and credit funds sent by overnight check by the close
of business on Day 3 for your margin call to be met.

Liquidating Positions to Meet Your Margin Call

In order to liquidate enough stock to meet the initial amount of your
margin call you must do the following:

1.   Determine the margin requirement for the position you wish to
liquidate.   Stocks with special margin requirements can be found on our
HelpDesk under "Your Portfolio" and "Margin Maintenance" or by using the
following link:

http://www.datek.com/helpdesk/margin.html

2.   Divide the amount of the margin call by the margin requirement for
the position you wish to liquidate.  This is equal to the dollar amount
of the security you must sell to meet the initial amount of the margin
call.

Example:

The amount of the margin call is $1500.  To determine the dollar amount
of a security you must sell to meet this margin call divide $1500 by the
margin requirement for the stock you wish to liquidate.  If the margin
requirement is 30% (.30) you must sell $5000 worth of the
position.  If the margin requirement is 40% (.40) you must sell $3750
worth of the stock.

Your Call Could be Satisfied Through Market Fluctuation

Margin calls are calculated after the close of business on a daily basis
using the closing prices for each day.  In order for you to meet your
margin call through market fluctuation your account must close the
traditional trading day above the minimum margin maintenance
requirements.  This must be done by the close of November 13-Day 3 in
order for the call to end.  Intra-day market fluctuation will not
suffice in meeting your margin call.

Please do not assume your call will be satisfied because stocks in your
portfolio are "bound to go up". All stocks are subject to market
volatility. There are no guarantees that a stock price will rise or
assurances that a stock will not decline. Furthermore, your stocks could
decline further, creating an even larger margin call. Once again, do not
"bank" on market fluctuation. Consider all factors, including your risk
tolerance, to take a realistic view of how to handle the margin call.


Account Equity and Additional House Calls

Depending on the securities you are holding in your portfolio and their
market fluctuations, additional funds may be due or actions that are
separate from this margin call may be required.  This may result in a
second house call.  The key is to understand the equity requirements and
ensure that your account is meeting them.  We may request additional
margin maintenance due to:

? A further decline in the market value of your positions.  At that time
you may meet a margin call only to be issued a second one because the
equity in the account has declined below a point where the initial
margin call no longer brings the account to the acceptable equity level.
In these instances, meeting the initial call may give you additional
time to meet the second call but the account must be returned to the
required equity ratio.
? Any undue concentration of one security in your account.

Needless to say, selling out an account is something we don't like to do
at Datek Online.  We want you to be aware of the status of your margin
account at all times, and be prepared to take action as soon as
conditions warrant.  Be fully aware that if at any time your account
value falls to approximately 10% equity, or if market conditions
warrant, we reserve the right to close out some or all of your positions
with or without notice, at our sole discretion.  You should review our
HelpDesk to check equity requirements.

If you have any questions please send email to support@datek.com or call
Customer Support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at 1-800-U2DATEK. Please
call 1-732-635-7500 if you are calling from outside of the United
States.

In order to give FERC an opportunity to consider the Mirant complaint, the 
NYISO
has determined that it will delay implementation of the AMPs until after 
FERC's
next scheduled meeting on May 16.

Just a short message to apprise everyone of the cleaning results performed on 
the filter separator from the Transwestern M/S.  Wipe tests taken of the 
interrior portions of the separator prior to cleaning revealed PCB results 
of: 360, 500 and 520 microgram.   This was not a standard wipe taken of a 
specific area.  These wipes were taken over large areas to determine 
presence/absence of PCB's within the separator.  After the cleaning operation 
was completed, three wipe samples were taken of the interrior portions of the 
separator.  All results showed non detect at less than 1.0 microgram.  I feel 
we can be fairly certain that the separator is free of residual PCBs.  

Jeff, would you pass this information on to your counterpart for PG&E?

Gentlemen,

Attached is our work to date (minus the telephone call summary sheets and
permit requirement summary sheets [Appendix A] you've already received) on
the Fatal Flaw Analysis/Briefing Report for Project Sundevil (or is it The
Sundevil Project, or Sun Devil [2 words, rather than 1])?  It truly is a
working document, and can be expanded in areas as you see fit, or there may
be other areas you may want us to discontinue researching.  This review
draft is provided for your review and input as to where you might like it
expanded and where you might like effort to be discontinued.  As I mentioned
yesterday, I will be out of town the remainder of the week.  Please contact
Jon Alstad in my absence with any action items and input you may have.
Thanks,  Scott

     The letter of credit should be posted by early next week at the
latest.  I don't know if a check for compensation land from KWBA has been
requested.  Kenny, do you know?  I suspect not.  Randi, if you could tell
me the amount and to whom it is payable, I can attempt to get it out of the
EOTT coffers.

     Scott, shall I assume you will take the lead on checking in with West
Coast to make sure they've submitted what they are supposed to have?
Thanks. --ETA

Kenny and all:

Here is an update regarding where we stand with Rogas biological resources
permitting:

FESA 10a(1)B: U.S.F.W.S. has mailed the letter to Kern Water Bank Authority
authorizing KWBA to sell credits to EOTT and permitting EOTT to be a
"covered" third party under KWBA's 10a(1)B permit; however, KWBA has not
yet
received the letter. When KWBA receives the letter, they will be able to
authorize the project as soon as they receive the check from EOTT for
compensation credits (I do not know if your right-of-way agreements and
encroachment permits are complete) and mitigation measures are implemented
(preactivity surveys, trapping).

CESA 2081 MOU: EOTT has notified CDFG that the project will commence and
who
the project rep is; CDFG has verbally concurred regarding our proposed
avoidance measures (including trapping) for Tipton kangaroo rats and
blunt-nosed leopard lizard; the project may commence on Coles Levee
Ecosystem
Preserve as soon as we implement the biological resource mitigation
measures
(preactivity survey - submitted to AERA; trapping; etc.) and the Letter of
Credit (or equivalent) is submitted to CDFG for compensation acres.

Bypass Channel: West Coast Environmental was supposed to have submitted
Streambed Alteration Notification and Clean Water Act (Army Corps)
notification within the last couple of days.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this e-mail.

Mike I wanted to give a short update on the latest events related to the PCB 
issue with PG&E.  Transwestern met with PG&E this last Wednesday with an 
agenda that included some sharing of sampling results collected downstream of 
their first C/S (Topock) and on out west toward their main distribution 
areas.  With respect to the most recent sampling data, Low PCB concentrations 
(N.D. to 38 ppm) have been detected in drips and interconnects between Topock 
and Hinckley C/S.  The good news is that PCB's have not been detected 
downstream of Hinckley which is approx. 160 miles from the Topock C/S.  PG&E 
has also initiated construction and installation of some drips and small 
separators at locations where their gas feeds into other lines or directly 
into customers.  the proposed installation date for the large mainline filter 
separators is still on target for 6/1/00.

Now for the bad news.  At the conclusion of the meeting, PG&E has stated that 
they want their Topock C/S decontaminated.  This includes all piping and 
equipment.  I stated to them the impractabibility and zero success rate of 
removing all the PCB's from their system and that there would be no 
quarantees that the deconning would be successful.   The contract PCB 
deconning companies only have permits which would guarantee cleanup to 10 
ug.  They were told that it would be impossible to clean everything and that 
in all probability the PCB concentrations would be showing up as the gas 
continues to move through the system.  Additionally, the better remediation 
approach would be to continue to remove PCB containing liquids at strategic 
locations.  Even with this, they were pretty insistent that their management 
wanted the facility cleaned.  Preliminary $$ estimates range to approx. 3-5 
million.

I think that this is only the "tip of the iceberg".  If they are successful 
with this action, the pipeline system will be next.  Their pipeline is not 
piggable and to make it such would require replacement of pipe, valves etc. 

Ill keep you informed on this,,,,,,,

A newly revised rule (Subpart HH) has just been implemented by the EPA 
concerning curde oil tanks with a daily throughput of equal to or greater 
than 500 bbls. per day.  If there is any tank within your teams area of 
responsiblity which equals or exceeds the 500 bbls. per day throughput 
criteria, please provide to me the following:


 tank name/serial number

 tank size

 average daily throughput

Thanks for your help in this matter....

Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp,lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of 
a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, 
captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric 
toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing 
human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre 
performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the 
people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the 
seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are 
available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 
713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied 
seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) 
are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of 
performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre 
ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de 
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o 
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving 
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early 
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the 
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, 
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as 
follows: "Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. 
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its 
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's 
prologue."
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a 
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), 
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet 
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet 
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking 
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, "It would 
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking 
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and 
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater 
stage."    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the 
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on 
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the 
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the 
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a 
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with 
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a 
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the 
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the 
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully 
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.

Roger, if EPA has approved other alternate methods for determining sulfur in 
fuel gas, can you approve of these for our sulfur methods?   The reason I ask 
is that we are not set up to do any of the applications mentioned in Appendix 
D.  We  have approved custom fuel monitoring schedules in place at 5 other 
compressor station locations and have been approved to use "stain tubes" or 
total sulfur analyzers.  These were issued by Region IX and Region VI.  I can 
send you copies of the approvals from the other Regions if that will help.  
If not, I would recommend that you write the permit with all the below 
referenced test methods and we will work out the details.  WIll it be 
possible to make a change to the permit after things quiet down a bit and we 
have more time to taylor the permit  for you and us?

Subject: Sulfur Content Test Method



Larry,

I am going on vacation for two weeks - my last day will be Oct. 31,
which is a little before the end of the comment period.  I am doing
everything I can to make sure the permits are ready to issue when the
comment period ends.  You have asked about using a sulfur analyzer.
Since that is not typical practice for facilities subject to NSPS GG, I
would have to research that.  Frankly, if you want your permits ASAP,
there really isn't time for that.  Does one of the test methods in
Appendix D of Part 75, which I've pasted below, work for you?  (I know
some don't.)  Please advise so we can keep the process moving.  Thanks.

2.3.3.1.2      Use one of the following methods when using manual
sampling (as applicable to the type of gas combusted) to determine the
sulfur
content of the fuel: ASTM D1072-90, "Standard Test Method for Total
Sulfur in Fuel Gases", ASTM D4468-85 (Reapproved 1989) "Standard
Test Method for Total Sulfur in Gaseous Fuels by Hydrogenolysis and
Radiometric Colorimetry," ASTM D5504-94 "Standard Test Method for
Determination of Sulfur Compounds in Natural Gas and Gaseous Fuels by
Gas Chromatography and Chemiluminescence," or ASTM D3246-81
(Reapproved 1987) "Standard Test Method for Sulfur in Petroleum Gas By
Oxidative Microcoulometry" (incorporated by reference under
o  75.6).

> Agency say no clean-up is required.
>
> When the PCBs were found in small quantities in the High Desert area in

>
> "We've been doing very aggressive testing," Tremayne said. "As we identify

>
> The filter separators catch the PCBs so the company can collect the

>
> Randy Wittorp, spokesperson for the California EPA office, said because
> the chemical is contained within the gas lines, it's unlikely there has
> been human exposure.
>
> "What we are talking about here is very low levels, well below EPA
> levels," Tremayne said.
>
> PCB levels detected in the area range from 2 to 22 parts per million,
> Tremayne said, with the majority of PCBs in the range of six to 10 parts
> per million.
>
> EPA regulations state the danger levels for PCBs are anything above 50
> parts per million, an EPA official said.
>
> "PCBs are authorized for use at concentrations of less than 50 PPMs," said
> Max Weintraub, PCB coordinator for the EPA in the California region. "The
> federal law really starts at 50 PPM. There's no requirement that they

>
> Tremayne said an EPA study shows PCBs have been known to cause cancer in
> laboratory rats. Information from the EPA shows exposure to the chemical
> has been associated with cancer, neurological and reproductive effects.
>
> "You're not going to breath it in, but you will get exposed to it through
> skin contact and consumption," Weintraub said.
>
> The material was detected as far away as 20 miles west of Hinkley and down
> into Rabbit Springs meter station. The Helendale regulation station has so
> far shown no detectable levels of PCBs, he said.
>
> PG&E delivers gas to Southwest Gas Co., who in turn serves 100,000

>
> Buehrer said his company has been testing for PCBs for about six weeks,
> and so far have not detected the chemical in their pipe lines.
>
> "We don't think there is anything to worry about because the levels are so

>
> Buehrer said the company will continue PCB testing through next week.
>
> The PCBs traveling through the gas lines are in small amounts, said Robert
> Doss, site remediation principal in the environmental services division of

>
> "We are not finding them at customer meters," Doss said. "The potential

Larry,

I gave the tree issue at Station 2 some thought and I have a couple of
concerns regarding the environmental report.  The report is being written,
based on the fact that all construction will occur within the station yard
and on previously disturbed ground.  If we impact areas (even within
existing facilities) that were not previously disturbed we are required to
include environmental data about those areas.

So the first question is whether the entire station yard has been
"previously disturbed".  To help determine this, I downloaded a USGS aerial
(1996) of the station from the internet and the trees occurring within the
station yard look to be the same age/size as those surrounding the station.
This would indicate that the areas within the station covered with trees
have not been "previously disturbed".  A copy of the aerial is attached.

However, it is conceivable that the site was cleared prior to initial
construction and the trees simply grew back.  Unfortunately, I don't have
that information and don't know if you do either.  And let me point out that
my concern is not whether Transwestern will receive approval to construct,
but the amount of information supplied in the report.  I want to feel
comfortable that we are supplying the required information to FERC.

For this project, that would primarily include a description of the existing
vegetation and soils (resource report 3 and 7).  All we would really need is
a brief description of the existing vegetation and soils, and how much will
be permanently impacted, etc. However, we did not budget any time to obtain
this information, nor did we anticipate the need for site visits.

My hope is that we can find an answer to whether the site was previously
disturbed or not.  If not, I hope to come up with some verbiage that
everyone is comfortable with to satisfy the FERC requirements.  Otherwise,
we will have to obtain the necessary information, and that's beyond our
initial scope.

If you have had any biological reports done for the area on other projects,
that may provide enough information.  Again, it only needs to be brief.
Also, we need to verify for the other 3 stations that we are constructing in
previously disturbed areas.

Lastly, Arnold has indicated that the hydro-test water will come from
existing water source at each station and that it will be discharged under
Transwestern's blanket permit.  Please verify...and I think we should
provide a copy of the blanket permit with the filing.

After you have had a chance to think about this, please call and we can
discuss.

Terry.

Dear larry,

It's hard to believe that summer is almost here, but my 
calendar is already filling up with graduations, weddings, 
family gatherings and barbeques.  As a photographer, one 
of my favorite things about these happy occasions is being 
able to take great pictures and share them with friends.  
I hope you're able to do the same at your summertime events 
this year.  We've included some tips in this newsletter to 
make sure you're prepared to capture those memorable 
moments.  Have fun!  

Cheers,
  
James Joaquin

NYISO  to  re-issue ECA 20000907A until the Market Participants can consider 
and
approve,  and  the  NYISO can implement, a tariff change required to 
permanently
address the Market Design Flaw.

As  stated in my Memorandum to you of September 6, 2000, I agreed with your
conclusion that the conduct identified at that time constituted a 

?Market Design
Flaw?  as  defined  in  Attachment  Q  to  the ISO OATT, Temporary 
Extraordinary
Procedures  for  Correcting  Market  Design  Flaws  and  Addressing 
Transitional
Abnormalities (the ?TEPs?).  As further stated in that Memorandum, I agreed 
with
your  analysis that prices produced by exploiting this Market Design Flaw 
would,
absent  appropriate action, remain at levels different from what would 
otherwise
occur during periods of efficient competition.

I  have  now  determined,  based  on  consultations  with ISO Staff and the
support  of the Business Issues Committee, that it is appropriate to maintain 
in
effect  the  corrective measures adopted as ECA 20000907A while consultation 
and
cooperation with the Market Participants and jurisdictional agencies is 
on-going
to  develop  and  implement appropriate rules or rule changes in accordance 
with
the ISO Agreement.

Please re-issue the text of the Extraordinary Corrective Action (?ECA?) and
post  it  on  the  OASIS,  for implementation effective at the expiration of 
ECA
20000907A.  The ECA shall be effective for a period of ninety (90) days.

Extraordinary Corrective Action 20001208A:

Market Design Flaw Regarding HAM Transactions Failing Checkout


Applicability

This Extraordinary Correction Action (ECA) shall apply to:

?    Import and export transactions;
?    that are scheduled for an operating hour in the Hour-Ahead Market (HAM) 
by
the Balancing Market Evaluation (BME); and
?    that fail checkout for reasons within the control of the Market
Participant, or that are cancelled at the request of said Market Participant.

Wheel-through transactions shall be treated as both an import and an export
transaction, and the relevant Market Participant shall be billed the sum of 
both
financial impacts, as provided below.  This ECA shall not apply to import,
export, or wheel-through transactions that fail checkout due to NYISO error or
action, or neighboring control area operator error or action.

Rationale

Import Transactions: During the HAM resolution, BME reduces commitments for
energy  resources  within  NYCA  to  accept  scheduled  import transactions 
at a
specific  proxy  bus  indicated  by the Market Participant.  Where the 
scheduled
import  transaction  fails checkout following BME, the real-time energy price 
at
the  proxy  bus  may  be  elevated  above the HAM price due to the failed 
import
transaction.   The  difference  between the real-time price and the BME price 
at
that  proxy  bus is currently charged to all purchasers in the real-time 
market.
Under  this  ECA,  this  amount  (when  positive),  multiplied  by the number 
of
megawatts  of  the  transaction  for  that  hour,  shall be billed to the 
Market
Participant that scheduled the failed import transaction as the financial 
impact
of causing the failure to complete checkout of the transaction.

Export  Transactions:  During the HAM resolution, BME makes commitments for
energy  resources  to  supply  scheduled  export transactions up to the 
purchase
price  indicated  by the Market Participant at the appropriate proxy bus.  
Where
the  scheduled  export  transaction  fails checkout following BME, the 
real-time
energy  price  at  the proxy bus may be depressed below the HAM price due to 
the
failed  export  transaction.   The  difference  between  the  BME  price and 
the
real-time  price  at that proxy bus is currently charged to all loads as part 
of
Schedule  1  costs.   Under this ECA, this amount (when positive), multiplied 
by
the number of megawatts of the transaction for that hour, shall be billed to 
the
Market Participant that scheduled the failed export transaction as the 
financial
impact of causing the failure to complete checkout of the transaction.

Wheel-Through   Transactions:  During  the  HAM  resolution,  BME  includes
scheduled wheel-through transactions up to the transmission congestion cost 
that
equals  the  decremental  bid  indicated  by  the Market Participant.  Where 
the
scheduled  wheel-through transaction fails checkout following BME, the 
real-time
energy  price  at  both  the  import  and export proxy busses may be elevated 
or
depressed,  respectively,  due  to the effects on transmission congestion of 
the
failed wheel-through transaction.  Under this ECA, the effects of the import 
and
export  portions  of  the  failed  wheel-through  transaction will be 
calculated
separately,  as though they were separate failed transactions.  The sum of 
those
impacts  shall  be  billed  to  the Market Participant that scheduled the 
failed
wheel-through  transaction  as  the  financial  impact of causing the failure 
to
complete checkout of the transaction.

Implementation Rules


1.   An External Transaction for the delivery of energy to the NYCA at an
external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which no energy 
is
delivered to the NYCA in real-time, will be settled by the scheduling entity
selling the amount of energy scheduled in BME into the LBMP Market at the
scheduling entity?s BME Bid Price, and buying the energy that was not 
delivered
from the LBMP Market at the Real-Time LBMP prevailing at the external Proxy
Generator Bus.  No payment will be required of the scheduling entity if it is
shown that the External Transaction was properly scheduled in each Control 
Area
and the energy was not delivered due to an error or action by the NYISO or the
delivering Control Area.  No payment will be required of, or made to the 
Market
Participant if the Real-Time LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus is lower
than the BME Bid Price of the entity that failed to deliver scheduled energy.

2.   An External Transaction for the receipt of energy from the NYCA at an
external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which no energy 
is
received from NYCA in real-time, will be settled by the scheduling entity 
buying
the amount of energy scheduled in BME from the LBMP Market at the scheduling
entity?s BME Bid Price and selling the energy that was not taken into the LBMP
Market at the Real-Time LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus.  No payment
will be required by the scheduling entity if it is shown that the External
Transaction was properly scheduled in each Control Area and the energy was not
taken by the scheduling entity due to an error or action by the NYISO or the
receiving Control Area.  No payment will be required of, or made to the Market
Participant if the Real-Time LBMP at the external Proxy Generator Bus is 
higher
than the BME Bid Price of the entity that failed to take scheduled energy.

3.   An External Transaction for the delivery of energy to the NYCA at one
external Proxy Generator Bus and the delivery of energy from the NYCA at a
different external Proxy Generator Bus that is scheduled in BME but for which 
no
energy is delivered to or received from the NYCA in real-time, will be settled
by applying rules 1 and 2 of this ECA separately to the failed delivery of
energy to the import Proxy Generator Bus and the failed receipt of energy at 
the
export Proxy Generator Bus, and summing the total of the two amounts for 
payment
by the scheduling entity.  No payment will be required by the scheduling 
entity
if it is shown that the External Transaction was properly scheduled in each
Control Area and the energy was not taken by the scheduling entity due to an
error or action by the NYISO or the delivering or receiving Control Area.  No
payment will be required of, or made to the Market Participant for the import 
or
the export portion of the External Transaction if no payment would have been
required had that portion of the transaction been a separate transaction under
rule 1 or 2 of this ECA.

that each application contained the correct and proper information required=
=20
by the EPA and State of Arizona.  When I told them that we would need the=
=20
permits by the end of September, each agency indicated that a September=20
permit issuance would not be a problem, in light of the fact that energy=20

aware of possible conflicts and resolve any concerns.  In all monthly calls=

both agencies assured me that the permits were progressing on schedule and =

date, calls to the agencies were conducted weekly and this was when I was=

The Environmental Affairs Department is developing a list of ETS natural gas 
pipeline facilities where the  condensate throughput exceeds 30,000 
gallons/year.  In the coming weeks, the Division Environmental Specialists 
will be asking your operating teams for annual condensate throughput at all 
facilities.  Please impress upon the teams the importance of collecting and 
providing this information as we have committed to a first quarter 2002 
deadline to compile the list.  This request is especially critical in areas 
prior to processing as the likelihood of the annual condensate throughput to 
exceed 30,000 gallons/year increases in those areas.

Please  call me at (402) 398-7716 or email me if you have any questions about 
this request.  Thank you for your help!

Kayne,

I've noticed some confusion lately on which CP name to use in EnPower for 
Ameren transmission - Ameren Services Company (ASC) is the right one.  If you 
could pass this along I would appreciate it.

Thanks,

barkerde@nmenergy.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



What if a product called External Transmission Reservation Rights (ETRR) was
conjured up that would allow a MP to reserve in/out ISONY transmission ?
MP's bid on 50 mw blocks for a month. The numbers of mws made available is
variable. The winners get the blocks with a bid block attached. For example 
,on
the PJM/NY interface 100 mws of ETRR's  for exports were sold in two blocks of
50. The winner's are given the bid blocks of 9999 and 9998 respectively. The
highest anyone not owning a ETRR could bid on the external interfaces is +/-
9900 thus insuring the assigned bid blocks first acceptance of their bids. 
Thus
the winners of the ETRR's (having already paid the ISO for the space) have the
ability to schedule the energy or not. Obviously this is an idea in the most
simplistic form that will allow the purchasing of long term transmission in a
financial transmission market. What do you think???

Larry,

Unfortunately, there does not appear to be an USGS aerial available that
covers Station 1.  In case you need them, I did find coverage for station 3
and 4.

Additionally, there is no published soil surveys covering any of the station
sites.  I intend to word resource report 7 to reflect that.  I will also
address impacts to soils.  I think this will suffice.  We did get some
vegetation descriptions put together for the areas in and around the
stations.

Terry.

For those teams that have turbines installed after 1990 and/or for those 
turbines which have undergone power  unit changouts, the following 
recordkeeping and monitoring conditions apply:

1) DAILY recordkeeping of nitrogen and sulfur must be taken of the fuel gas 
which supplies the applicable turbine(s). 

2) This recordkeeping consists of electronic recording (gas chromtograph for 
nitrogen and  delmar or equivelant for sulfur) or stain tubes may also be 
used  for sulfur. These DAILY records include measurements on Saturdays and 
Sundays.

3) The measurement must be taken at the location.  An exception to this is 
that the nitrogen and sulfur measurements may be taken upstream or 
downstream  of the applicable turbine facility provided that there are no 
natural gas deliveries into the pipe which would interfere or dilute/increase 
the measurements  for the applicable turbine fuel gas. 

4) Fuel gas records in hard copy form or equivalent  for  the nitrogen and 
sulfur must be maintained at the facility or at a central location for easy 
retrival.  

5) A turbine facility may waiver out of this nitorgen and sulfur daily 
recordkeeping requirement by obtaining a custom fuel monitoring schedule 
(CFMS) from  the EPA.  Approval of a  CFMS allows a greatly reduced 
recordkeeping and reporting for nitrogen and sulfur.  CFMS requests have been 
submitted for the  following facilities:

   P-1 C/S
   Plains Turbine C/S
   Atoka No 2 C/S
   Monument C/S
   Crawford C/S
   Bloomfield C/S
 
Approvals have not as yet been obtained.  Until issuance of a CFMS, an 
applicable facility is required to continue daily sampling for nitrogen and 
sulfur.   
 
Facilities which have received CFMS from the EPA include:

   La Plata C/S
   P-2 C/S

Please be advised that there may be certain reporting requirements that might 
be required for each CFMS.  I would strongly advise that the La Plata and 
Panhandle  teams review their CFMS and include reporting dates into MCS, so 
that the deadlines and reportings are not missed. 

If you have a turbine facility which is subject to the nitrogen and sulfur 
reporting requirements and would like to reduce the reporting burden, contact 
Butch or myself.

Jon, Here's the latest comment from Jim:
don't see why a test before the change and after the change using the same
analyzer would not demonstrate no increase in emissions.

Duncan,
Ok.  We'll test an engine.  This project involves 5 identical engines.  We
want to test just one - will you accept that?  Will you accept portable
analyzer test results?  These analyzers have been certified by the state of
New Mexico to be plus/minus 3% from full trailer tests.
Thanks,
Jon

IF there is no increase in emissions, this is probably not a modification
and the Grandfathered status would remain.  They would need to demonstrate
that there is no change.  This could require testing before and after the
change.

     Here is the crane team list, I have found an EOTT tank and pressure
vessel Inservice Inspection reports, The bottom of report has EOTT-23, and
a 195-432 number on it. I have also found a folder with Texas title V air
permits on it and it has the tank information that shows tanks grand
fathered. This says General operating permit application for the Equilon
pipeline company LLC Crane station TNRCC ACCOUNT NO. CY-0016-N Crane county
texas, dated October 1998. If you need these sent to you i can make copies
of all the pages and mail them to you. There is about 40 pages in file.
Let me know if i can be of any other help.  Duane Konen.

Rick/Scott:

Thanks for the info.

I wanted to give you an update on the CoGen project.  I have met with
several groups in ENA Development, and the potential for a fuel switching
facility is attracting a lot of attention.  They initially considered the
20 MW portable unit, but now think there may be more value with a 40 to 50
MW unit.  The opportunity to generate more power using the fuel advantage
caught their eye.  The current scheme is to site the facility at the Tupman
plant, provide EOTT steam and power at a reduced cost, ENA market the
electricity, and EOT participate in the revenue of power sale.  This has
the advantage of controlled energy cost for the plant, participation in the
revenue stream, and limited capital outlay for EOTT.  The downside would be
lack of control of the merchant power activity, and it would be a permanent
facility.  I am also assuming permitting and emissions compliance issues
would not be extraordinary.

There will be a longer construction time, but I stressed to ENA that a new
boiler would need to be built first in anticipation of the generator, and
then it could be incorporated when available.

There were some more questions regarding the plant's energy profile.  I
gave them the information showing historic, and anticipated energy needs,
both for power and gas.  They do need to understand what the daily heat
requirements would be; i.e.  hours of operation at the plant, 8 hr
operations Vs 24 hr operation, temperature requirements for your processes,
are there peak requirements, are there any pressure requirements for steam
or just heat, does the plant shut down operations routinely, etc.  I passed
along you names (Rick & Scott only) as plant contacts as questions come up.

Thanks for your help, and I'll let you know how things progress.

Bob

See attached for sample results for this months sample run. Larry I think the 
reson we got NDs on our samples is because the lab raised the reporting limit 
due to dilution necessary for analysis. Don't know why maybe you can find out 
for us. We won't use this lab next  time, we will be going back to Sherwood 
Labs.  Thanks, Randy

Kenny and Scott,

I agree with Ed's note concerning the need to move expeditiously in the
purchase of compensation acreage noted by the US Fish and Wildlife Service
(Service) in there approval letter.  This in indeed "good news" and EOTT
must move ahead to fulfill its obligation as per the MOU and Incidental
Take Permit.  By copy of this email, I am asking Larry Campbell to work
with both of you to assist in the proper fulfillment of EOTT's obligation
as promptly as possible.

It is also my understanding, from what research I have been able to do,
that EOTT does have approximately 14 to 15 acres of credit at the North
Coles Levee Preserve.  You should verify the exact credit number and
furnish the Service with such verification.  That is acreage EOTT will not
have to purchase in satisfying the obligation of the permit.

Keep me posted as you move forward on this issue.  John Shafer

Subject:  Rogas Line -- USFW Approval


     Randi McCormick just forwarded to me a letter addressed to EOTT, dated
February 14, 2001  from the US Fish and Wildlife Service approving our
project "for participation in the Kern Water Bank Compensation Bank," and
authorizing the Water Bank "to extend their incidental take authority to
you and your entire project under their Master Permit."  This is, of
course, very good news.

     The letter notes, however, that we still need to purchase compensation
acreage both at North Coles Levee and at the Kern Water Bank.
Specifically, we must do the following:  (1) contact Cheryl Harding of Kern
Water Bank to acquire 23.1 acres of compensation credits, and to get
included in their Master Permit; and (2) get Cheryl Harding a letter from
the Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve (Mark Poe of Aera) stating that we have
purchased 15.3 acres of credits for North Coles Levee, or that we have set
aside that amount from credits we have in the past purchased.

     While I could make these contacts, I do not believe that would be wise
because -- as Kenny can attest -- our past experience has been that
whenever a lawyer contacts the Water Bank, it prompts them to automatically
get their lawyers involved.  And our experience has been that this only
slows things down -- or worse.

     My suggestion therefore is that one or both of you gentlemen contact
Cheryl as soon as practical and ask her for (1) proposed contract for
acquisition of 23.1 acres of compensation credits and (2) perperwork to
include EOTT (and its contractors) in their Master Permit.  She should also
be informed that, while we have not yet purchased the 15.3 acres of NCL
credits, we will by the end of this week have a letter of credit posted as
security, as allowed under our State Take Permit, to cover this amount of
acreage.  Ask whether a copy of this LC will suffice for her purposes, or
whether we will need to have the actual acreage purchased.

     As this would remove a major impediment to construction of the new
lines, it is important that we move on this will all deliberate speed.
Please call me if you have any questions, or if you would like otherwise to
discuss how to approach this issue.  Thanks a lot.

                          --ETA

Christi,
?
Here is the paper  you wanted.
?
All,
?
This excellent and  easy to read paper makes a good argument as to why 
continuously clearing markets  are more efficient than single price 
(ISO/PX-like) regimes.? I've already  sent a few of you hardcopy, but Christi 
and I thought it would be good for all  to read.

The answer to your question is that all emissions reported on the emissions 
inventory should be included in the calculation of emissions fees. This leads 
to another question-what emissions should be reported on the emissions 
inventory?

I discussed this issue with a TNRCC emissions inventory team leader. He 
informed me that that is no written guidance on how to report upset, 
maintenance, start-up, and shutdown emissions on the emissions inventory, and 
as a result be included in emission fees. He did indicate that at previous 
emissions inventory workshops, attendees were verbally told to only include 
"reportable" (emissions that exceed RQ) on their inventories, and not  
"recordable" (non-reportable) emissions. He also mentioned that one ton/year 
would also be an acceptable threshold for including emissions in the 
inventory.

He is aware that  upset, maintenance, start-up, and shutdown emissions are an 
important issue, now that they are included in fees. He indicated that TNRCC 
will be putting out definitive information on this issue in future emissions 
inventory workshops and guidance, in preparation for submittal of calendar 
year 2001 inventories that will be due in 2002.

Subject: TNRCC Emission Fees

In the last session, legislation was passed in Texas that requires the 
payment of emission fees for upset, maintenance, start-up, and shutdown 
emissions. Previously these emissions were required to be included in 
emission inventories, but not when calculating the fees. Funds generated by 
the inclusion of these emissions are to be used by TNRCC for enforcement and 
monitoring activities for air quality permitting, air quality assessment and 
planning, and enforcement and compliance support. 
TNRCC is requiring that the additional fees for upset, maintenance, start-up, 
and shutdown emissions be included in the fees that are due this Fall for 
calendar year 2000 emissions. Industry groups are questioning the legality of 
TNRCC requiring the added fees for 2000 emissions since the effective date of 
the legislation was September, 2001. TNRCC is being requested to change this 
and legal action is being considered. I will keep you updated as this issue 
develops.

Subject:  PJM Announces CSS Training Program



Message sent from the pjm-customer-info mailing list at
pjm-customer-info@majordomo.pjm.com:

On June 12, PJM will implement the Collaborative Scheduling System (CSS), a 
new
scheduling tool designed to facilitate transaction schedules between New York
and PJM.
CSS will become part of the EES tool now used to schedule transactions from 
and
to PJM neighbors.

PJM will offer several two-hour "virtual" workshops to introduce the new 
system.
Participants who now use EES and will use CSS are encouraged to attend one of
these workshops.  The dates for the workshops are: May 31 at 10:00 a.m., June 
5
at 2:00 p.m. or June 11 at 2:00 p.m. The workshops will be presented on the
internet with audio teleconference.

A complete description of the new tool, the training program, and a 
registration

Subject: Grandfathered Facilities - Endangered Species With No
Prospects of Protection

The days of grandfathered facilities in Texas are numbered.  This does not
only mean those large facilities in nonattainment areas, but ANY facility
that was constructed prior to September, 1971 and has not subsequently been
rolled into some sort of new source review (NSR) permit or Permit by Rule
(formerly Standard Exemption).  Note that proposed new rules recently
published in the Texas Register for public comment will require operators to
be able to produce documentation of applicability and compliance for all
facilities authorized by a Permit by Rule/Standard Exemption, much the same
as is required for any other type of permit.

The TNRCC Sunset Bill contains language limiting the time that such
facilities may operate without NSR authorization of some sort.  The Senate
Committee Substitute (SCS) for HB 2912 is a little stricter than the version
passed by the House, but both versions did contain grandfathered facility
permitting provisions and it is safe to assume that the final version will
also.  If this version passes, you will have one additional year to apply
for a Voluntary Emissions Reduction Permit (VERP).  If your facility is a
pipeline facility, the TNRCC will require no more than a 30% reduction in
NOx, and that reduction can be averaged for several facilities in the same
area covered in one permit.

Note that it is only through the efforts of our lobbyists - particularly
Cindy Morphew of TxOGA and Celina Romero of ATINGP - that it looks as though
we will get an additional opportunity to get these facilities permitted
without having to use today's BACT.

This memo summarizes the SCS provisions for your information.  This is NOT
actual bill language - I've TRIED to make it easier to read.

Note that these provisions may be changed somewhat if the House does not
concur in all of the changes made by the Senate and the bill goes to
Conference.  In addition, we expect a strong attempt to amend the bill on
the Senate floor to require shutdown on September 1, 2001 of grandfathered
facilities that do not have a pending permit application.  If that attempt
is successful, the opportunity to apply for a VERP will be gone on September
1.

The memo also recaps previous recommendations to you regarding the current
opportunity to claim historical Permits by Rule (Standard Exemptions) as a
means of permitting a grandfathered facility.  I am not certain how long
this opportunity will continue to exist.  TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT WHILE YOU
CAN.

In addition, I've appended some information on 10-year old BACT for
gas-fired IC engines and turbines that might be useful if you are trying to
get a VERP now.




PROVISIONS OF SCS FOR HB 2912 (PRIOR TO SENATE FLOOR DEBATE)

Sec. 382.05181.  PERMIT REQUIRED.

(a)  Any grandfathered facility that does not have an application pending
for a new source review permit or other authorization, other than a federal
operating permit, and that has not submitted a notice of shutdown as
provided in Section 382.05182 may not emit air contaminants on or after:

 (1)  September 1, 2003, if the facility is located in a
nonattainment area; or

 (2)  September 1, 2005, if the facility is located in an attainment
area.

(b)  Any grandfathered facility that does not have a permit or other
authorization under this chapter, other than a federal operating permit
permit, may not emit air contaminants on or after:

 (1)  September 1, 2005, if the facility is located in a
nonattainment area; or

 (2)  September 1, 2007, if the facility is located in an attainment
area.

(c)  Facilities eligible for a Small Business Stationary Source Permit are
subject to the permitting deadlines in Section 382.05184.

Sec. 382.05182.  NOTICE OF SHUTDOWN.

(a)  A notice of shutdown to allow operation of a grandfathered facility
beyond the deadlines of 382.05181(a) must be filed with the commission
before the applicable deadline.

(b)  A notice under this section shall include:

  (1)  the date the facility intends to cease operating;

  (2)  an inventory of the type and amount of emissions that
will be eliminated when the facility ceases to operate; and

  (3)  any other necessary and relevant information the
commission by rule deems appropriate.

GENERAL PROVISIONS (APPLICABLE TO PERMITS UNDER 382.05183, 382.05184, AND
382.05186)

(a)  The commission shall grant a permit under this section if, from the
information available to the commission, including information presented at
any public hearing or through written comment, the commission finds that
there is no indication that the emissions from the facility will contravene
the intent of this chapter, including protection of the public's health and
physical property.

(b)  If the commission finds that the emissions from the facility will not
comply with Subsection (c), the commission may not grant the permit under
this section.

(c)  A person planning the modification of a facility previously permitted
under this section must comply with new source permitting requirements
before modifying.

(d)  The commission may adopt rules as necessary to implement and administer
this section.

(e)  If an applicant omits any relevant facts or submits incorrect
information in an application, the applicant shall submit the relevant facts
or correct the information no later than 60 days after discovering the
error.  If while processing the application, the commission determines that
additional information is necessary to evaluate or to take final action on
the application, the commission may request the information and set a
reasonable deadline for a response.  Failure to comply with the deadline for
the response will result in the application being returned to the applicant.

Sec. 382.05183.  EXISTING FACILITY PERMIT.

(a)  The owner or operator of a grandfathered facility may apply for a
permit to operate the facility under this section.

(b)  The commission shall grant a permit under this section if, from the
information available to the commission, including information presented at
any public hearing or through written comment, the commission finds that the
application:

  (1)  is filed before September 1, 2002 and the facility will
use an air pollution control method at least as effective as 10-year old
BACT; or

  (2)  is filed before the applicable deadline of 382.05181(a)
and the facility will use current BACT.

(c)  The commission may issue an existing facility flexible permit for some
or all of the grandfathered facilities at a site.  Permits issued under this
subsection shall follow the same permit issuance, modification, and renewal
procedures as existing facility permits.

Sec. 382.05184.  SMALL BUSINESS STATIONARY SOURCE PERMIT.

(a)  Grandfathered facilities that are located at a small business
stationary source and are not required by commission rule to submit an
annual emissions inventory report may apply for a permit under this section
before September 1, 2005.

(b)  Grandfathered facilities that are located at a small business
stationary source that does not have an application pending for a new source
review permit or other authorization, other than a federal operating permit,
and that has not submitted a notice of shutdown, may not emit air
contaminants on or after September 1, 2007.

Sec.  382.05185.  ELECTRIC GENERATING FACILITY PERMIT.

Special provisions for permitting grandfathered electric generating
facilities are not outlined in this memo.

Sec. 382.05186.  AUTHORIZATION FOR PIPELINE FACILITIES.

(a)  The commission by rule shall establish the procedures for applications
for grandfathered processing, treating, compression, or pumping facilities
connected to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline.

(b)  Based on a prioritization by the commission as necessary to meet local,
regional, and statewide air quality needs related directly or indirectly to
federal air quality standards, the commission may require up to a 30%
reduction of the hourly emission rates of NOx and VOC from reciprocating
internal combustion engines subject to this section.  For facilities other
than reciprocating internal combustion engines that are connected to or part
of a gathering or transmission pipeline , the commission may consider
requiring hourly emissions rate reductions of up to 30% for NOx and 20% for
VOC.  The commission by rule may designate counties or regions of the state
where greater reductions in the hourly emission rate will be required than
in other areas, but no more than 30 percent reductions in the hourly rate
may be required in any area.

(c)  The commission shall:

  (1)  allow for a single permit for all facilities connected
to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline;

  (2)  allow for required reductions for facilities under this
section to be achieved at one facility or averaged among more than one
facility and located in the same local, regional, or statewide areas
designated by the commission under Subsection (b);

  (3)  for purposes of emission averaging, allow emission
reductions achieved from grandfathered since September 1, 1997; and

  (4)  allow an owner or operator to apply for separate
permits under this section for discrete and separate facilities connected to
or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline.

(d)  Facilities authorized by this section shall be considered permitted
under this chapter.




CURRENT OPPORTUNITY TO CLAIM A PERMIT BY RULE TO "PERMIT" A GRANDFATHERED
FACILITY

TNRCC has interpreted its rules to allow operators to permit grandfathered
facilities using any applicable "Permit by Rule," including those previously
referred to as Standard Exemptions.

For instance, old Standard Exemption 7, effective May 8, 1972, was for "Gas
fired internal combustion engines of less than 2000 hp and engine trains of
less than 5000 hp total" and can be used to permit any such engine(s).  For
clarification on this particular exemption, the language used by staff in
proposing this exemption to the Texas Air Control Board in 1972 was as
follows:  "Engines smaller than 2000 hp are quite numerous and are not
considered a substantial source unless joined together IN SERIES (emphasis
added) to form an engine train.  Engine trains of less than 5000 hp are not
considered a substantial source.  Because control technology for NOx
emissions from internal combustion and gas fired engines is very limited, it
is doubtful if significant control could be achieved through the permit
system at this time."  ("Exemptions From Permits Procedures and
Justification for Exemptions," <signed> Charles R. Barden, P.E., Executive
Secretary, Texas Air Control Board, May 8, 1972.)

A list of the "Historical Standard Exemptions" is available on the TNRCC
Website at http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/air/nsr_permits/oldselist/index.html

applying these "Permits by Rule," be sure to check the corresponding
"Exemption Preambles" (if any) for any applicable General Conditions.

TNRCC has asked that we document such permitting of grandfathered facilities
by PI-8 AND a simple notification cover letter to them so that they will
have a record that the facilities have been permitted and are no longer
considered to be grandfathered.  The registration will buy you a letter of
acknowledgement that you have claimed the "permit by rule" (don't use the
term "exemption" in any correspondence) for these engines.

Subject: Response to 11/21/00 Teleconference 001204

I believe that we have now gotten the last bit of information that the TRNCC
will provide to us regarding the development of guidelines for 10-year BACT
for grandfathered engines and turbines for use in the VERP program.  The
last piece of information is an email that I am forwarding to you with this
email.  It is an email from John Steib to which he attaches an email from
Jim Linville.  In response to a request from us, Jim Linville sets forth in
his email an example of a large engine with emissions in the 29 gram per
horsepower hour range that cannot reduce emissions to the 2-8 gram level and
what the owner/operator of that engine must demonstrate in order to obtain a
VERP permit.
Remember, that in order to be included in the TNRCC's January 15, 2001
report to the legislature, a letter of intent or application for a VERP
should be filed with the TNRCC on or before next Thursday, December 7, 2000.
To summarize, we have obtained the following policies from the TNRCC:
1. Grandfathered internal combustion engines of less than 2000
horsepower can be authorized by Standard Exemption No. 6 effective December
1, 1972, regardless of the level of emissions from those facilities. (See my
letter to Kerry Drake dated September 15, 2000 and Drake's letter to me
dated October 3, 2000).
2. Grandfathered engine trains of less than 5000 horsepower, or a
portion of an engine train up to 5000 horsepower may be authorized under
Standard Exemption No. 6, December 1, 1972, so long as each engine in the
train does not exceed 2000 horsepower.  (See my letter to James Randall
dated November 1, 2000 and Randall's letter to me dated November 16, 2000).
3. Grandfathered turbines of less than 20,000 horsepower may be
authorized by Standard Exemption No. 82, dated December 1, 1972 regardless
of the level of emissions.  (See my letter to Kerry Drake dated September
15, 2000 and Drake's letter to me dated October 3, 2000).
4. Grandfathered engines and turbines that are able to be controlled to
the 2-8 gram range will not be subject to an economic reasonableness review.
(See James Randall's letter to me dated November 16, 2000).
5. Grandfathered engines and turbines that are not able to be
controlled to the 2-8 gram range may be permittable under a VERP if there is
test data to validate the old (pre-modification) and new (post-modification)
emission rates to document that verifiable reductions in actual emissions
would be achieved.  Also needed would be a representation of the cost of the
controls and even though additional modifications are available, the
additional cost is prohibitive. (See Jim Randall's letter to me dated
November 16, 2000 and the email attached hereto).

I hope all of this is helpful.  I have forwarded to you copies of the
referenced letters by fax on earlier dates.  If you need another copy please
let me know.

Celina and James,

During our teleconference today, you asked for an example of what we would
consider "significant emission reductions" that would be acceptable in a
case-by-case review when the 2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOx level could not be achieved.
A large 2-stroke engine that is currently emitting approximately 29 g/hp-hr
of NOx would be considered to have significant emissions reductions if
actual emissions are reduced by 50 percent even though it does not meet the
2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOx level.  We would agree that this would have been
considered BACT 10 years ago if there was test data to validate the old
(pre-modification) and new (post-modification) emission rates to document
that verifiable reductions in actual emissions would be achieved.  Also
needed in the case-by-case review would be a representation of what the cost
of the controls would be with a discussion of why the  2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOx
level could not be achieved.  This may be due to technical limitations such
as no additional controls or modifications are possible, or you may identify
cost in dollars per ton of NOx controlled to show that even though
additional modifications are available, the cost is prohibitive.

Subject: letter from TNRCC re 10-yr BACT

I received by fax late yesterday evening, a letter signed by John Steib re
10-yr BACT guidelines for engines and turbines for use in the VERP program.
After my first read, it looks pretty good.  Look for a copy of it by fax.
Let me know if you have any comments or concerns that we need to clear up
with the TNRCC.

Re: Permitting Grandfathered Internal Combustion
  Engines and Turbines

Dear Ms. Romero:

As discussed in our meetings and teleconferences concerning the options for
grandfathered internal combustion engines and turbines, we have agreed that
some of these facilities may qualify under Standard Exemption Nos. 6 or 82,
effective on December 1, 1972 and others may be permitted under 30 Texas
Administrative Code (TAC) Chapter 116, Subchapter H:  Voluntary Emission
Reduction Permits (VERP).  Specific questions raised are discussed below.

You have asked for our understanding of what qualifies as an "engine train
of less than 5,000 hp." In your November 1, 2000 letter you gave two
examples of "engine trains" that you felt would meet Standard Exemption No.
6, "Gas fired internal combustion engines of less than 2000 hp and engine
trains of less than 5,000 hp total."  We agree that several engines, each
less than 2000 hp, can be combined into a "train" providing compression to a
common header so long as the train does not exceed 5,000 hp, meet the
exemption requirements.  In cases where the total horsepower in a train
exceeds 5,000 hp, we will allow exemption of individual engines within such
a train provided that each engine is less than 2000 hp and the total
horsepower of exempted engines in the train does not exceed 5,000 hp.  In
the same standard exemption list, turbines were covered by Standard
Exemption No. 82, "Gas turbines of less than 20,000 hp burning sweet natural
gas."

The other major point of discussion has been the determination of "10 year
old BACT" required by 30 TAC o116.811(3)(A).  As we discussed, our review of
permitting 10 years ago reveals that very few, if any, old engines were
permitted; so no data is available to show what we would have required for
nitrogen oxides (NOX) best available control technology (BACT).  New engines
were permitted at 2 grams/horsepower-hour (g/hp-hr) of NOX for both rich
burn and lean burn engines.  At that time older rich burn engines could have
been readily upgraded with catalytic converters to meet this 2 g/hp-hr limit
for NOX.  Lean burn engines were and are still more problematic as both
2-stroke and 4-stroke versions are available, and no single method of
control is applicable.  The large number of different engine manufacturers,
and the availability of various models, makes it impossible to establish a
single 10 year old BACT level.  Some of the older engines may be capable of
being upgraded to meet a level of NOX of 5 to 8 g/hp-hr, the level
established in the 1992 revision of Standard Exemption No. 6, which also
established a 3 g/hp-hr standard for turbines.  While the standard exemption
does not establish BACT for upgrades it does recognize what is available.
Many of the grandfathered engines are large and some have emissions as high
as 25 to 29 g/hp-hr, so significant emission reductions may be achievable
even if they are not able to reduce to the emissions control level of 2 to 8
g/hp-hr.  The 10 year old BACT review on these engines and turbines will
have to be done on a case-by-case basis just as we would have done 10 years
ago.

We hope this guidance will allow your members to decide which engines they
will be able to either exempt or permit under the VERP program and submit
their letters of intent to participate in the VERP program by December 7,
2000.

For engines and turbines that your members decide to propose for
authorization under Standard Exemption Nos. 6 and 82, please identify the
specific engines and turbines, identified by unit number, emission point
number (EPN), air quality account number, and plant name; and for each
account please submit a Form PI-7.  For each engine or turbine, please
submit a, Table 29 or 31 as applicable, and other technical information that
will support the standard exemption claim.

For engines that will be authorized by a VERP permit, please identify each
engine by unit number, EPN, air quality account number, and plant name, and
provide an estimate of the amount of emissions reductions anticipated as a
result of participation in the VERP program.  When the VERP applications are
submitted, information should be provided to show that NOX emissions will be
in the 2 to 8 g/hp-hr range.  If it is not possible to achieve this level of
emissions, please submit information that shows that it is not technically
feasible or economically reasonable to control NOX emissions to that level.
Information showing that actual emissions reductions will be achieved, even
when the targeted range of 2 to 8 g/hp-hr cannot be met, will be helpful in
staff review of the application.

We appreciate your assistance in helping us to make the VERP program a
success.  If you have any further questions, please contact Mr. James
Randall, P.E. at (512) 239-1078.

I am writing you to inform you of an incident that occurred at the NCL
FRACTIONATOR this week. I would like to go into detail on what occurred to
ensure that everyone has a good understanding of what kind of employee is
involved and the potential for further intentional acts like this from this
disgruntled employee. I would like to have some feedback on this to ensure
that we take the necessary means to ensure that we cover all of the basis.

On Wednesday 1/31/01 we had a PSV go off on one of our process vessels due
to a plant upset. I was notified that the incident was minimal with no
spill or Hydrocarbon release which exceeded the reportable quantity. I
quickly drove to the sight and investigated the incident, I found the
information to be true. There was no detectable hydrocarbon, only a small
amount of rust on the ground which was ejected from the inside of the
emergency stack. I notified the head plant operator & requested an incident
report to be filled out, which he has since delivered to me. I checked the
stack chart and noticed only a small release. At this point I felt that
there was no reason to call in a breakdown to the APCD because we had
neither exceeded the reportable quantity, and the equipment did as it was
designed breaking no rules. I then assigned a clean up crew and an employee
to inspect the PSV's and ensure the proper operation of the equipment
involved. All was cleaned up and the equipment serviced properly, and I am
currently going over the incident report with our safety coordinator.

During the clean up on the day of the incident I was approached by our
Utility Operator Clark Layshot who was on during the incident. Clark was
very upset and was pointing the finger at Mark Stringer who was the Head
Operator on duty. Clark said that the PSV had gone off for an hour and had
released over 5000 gallons of NGL. I new this to be untrue for many
reasons, for one I responded quickly enough that the liquid would still
have been there on the ground, the chart showed exactly the time of
starting and stopping of the release which was just a matter of minutes, I
also new because I was on the phone with the others involved on my drive
out to the plant. I listened to Clarks remarks and let him know that I was
investigating the incident and the discussion was ended.

The following day while I was giving a operational tour to Eugene Ogorman,
I was confronted once more by Clark who said he needed to speak to me
immediately, so I excused myself and met with Clark. Clark said that I
could either have 5 hours or 2 weeks, I asked Clark what he meant and he
said that he was giving his notice. I then asked him why when he became
extremely hostile and said in many words that he was very unhappy! He told
me that everyone was liars, that ENRON was a horrible company, that the
facility was going to blow up and how he was going to kick some of the
employees asses. This went on for a while with numerous other extremely
intense encounters. I then notified my boss, Rick Suderman who in turn made
the appropriate calls.

Today we were the recipients of an incident investigation performed by the
SJVU APCD. We were met by Mike Oldershaw of the APCD who typically does our
compliance testing. Mike informed us that his office was notified of an
incident which released for 48 hours NGL through our west emergency stack.
They were also told that the ground was saturated with hydrocarbon and
insinuated that EOTT/ETS operations was trying to hide this.

Myself and Rick Suderman accompanied Mike through the complete
investigation which included inspection of the release sight, inspection of
the operator logs, inspection of the stack flow charts, and an emission
inspection of the components involved. Mike expressed to us that who ever
called in was disgruntled and obviously fabricated a story to try and
create problems for the company. We went over the permit for the usage of
the emergency stack and all agreed that we were not in violation. Mike was
not sure if a breakdown needed to be reported, so he agreed to call us with
the final outcome of this investigation once he discussed it with his boss.

I am happy to say that after all of this Mike Oldershaw called me back and
said that he had talked to his boss and they both agree that we followed
the rules and none were broken. Mike said that we were in compliance and
there would be no NOTICE OF VIOLATION, the equipment did as it was designed
and the operations group worked well in controlling and isolating the
situation. Mike said that he feels very good about what EOTT and ETS is
doing and the approach that we are taking to ensure compliance. I have
since notified Larry Campbell who informed me to call John steenberg and to
send an email to all of you.

If there are any questions please contact me, thanks for all of your help,
Scott

The State of New Mexico has issued the settlement penalty for the turbine 
replacement issue at the P-1 C/S.  You may remember that the original amount 
levied against Transwestern in 1997  was $14,700.  After the Air Quality 
Bureau sat on this issue for more than 4 years, they reassessed the penalty 
to be $162,770.  I would like to get together and discus what our options are 
on this.

Larry,

Here is the info on the Elizabethtown Suiza that should begin 9/1.  I was not 
copied on the e mail, but you should have received a notification to flow 
from JoAnn Lavine.  Utility turn on should be complete by CSC.  Please let me 
know if serving this site is a problem.



Thank you!

Susan

NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees


Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy 
bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 
people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote 
Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers 
control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow 
thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, 
including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket 
PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy 
Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot 
program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up 
to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and 
the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution 
pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For 
more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the 
Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be 
a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even 
have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more 
information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to 
connections@newpower.com.

A meeting has been scheduled on 3/16 with the California Fish and Game to 
discuss the following issues:  1)presentaiton of the 1999 and 2000 annual 
reports which are required by the facility's 2081 permit. 2) developing an 
agreement with F&G as to how the 41 acre credits held by EOTT will be managed 
to ensure compliance with requirements of the F&G. 3) Presentation of the 
results relating to surveys conducted in the path of construction for the 
Rogas project.

The waiver to lay pipeline above ground for the Rogas constsruction was 
approved by the Offfice of the State Fire Marshall, Pipeline Safety 
Division.  There were 8 city, county, state and federal agencies notified by 
application for approval to construct the 9 mile pipline system consisting of 
3 piplines.  This is the only agency approval received as yet.

Acre credits were obtained from Aera for the construction of the Rogas 
pipeline.  Aera is an oil company with major holdings of acreage available 
for purchase.  It was felt that due to the time constraints for initiating 
this project and the concern with not receiving the credits from the F&G that 
EOTT would purchase Aera credits to ensure procurement of the necessary 
acreage for the Rogas project.  This is a major plus for the project.

The rough draft of the baseline noise survey for the turbine installations in 
Az. was received.  Some changes will be made in each document.,  as the 
contractor has made some obvious conclusions and asumptions which are not 
valid or representative of the mitigation Transwetern will do.  The Navajo 
Nation has requested that an onsite survey be conducted at the C/S on the 
reservation (C/S 3 and 4)  for T&E plants and animals and archeology.  A 
contractor has been notified and surveys will be completed by 3/12. The F-1 
environmental report  for the FERC application will be submitted to Donna by 
this friday.   

The air permit applications for C/S 1 and 2 have been started.   A meeting 
with EPA in San Francisco has abeen set to discuss permitting the C/S 
facilities on the reservation on 3/20.  After the meeting, applications 
should be in front of the Navajo air permitting agency and the EPA within a 
week. Air permits are expected  within 5-7 months after submittal of the 
application.  During a conference call this week, a proposal was submitted to 
remove the existing auxillary generators and replace with 2 units at each 
location.  This will delay submittal of the air applications 3-4 days, 
assuming no major issues result.  One interesting issue that might develop is 
that one of the generators might possibly be a wind turbine.

speak like that (at least not to me..)

Markets Committee Members:  A meeting of the Working Group of the Markets
Committee has been scheduled for Wednesday, December 13, 2000 from 9:00 a.m.
to 3:00 p.m. at the Holiday Inn in Holyoke, MA.  The meeting's agenda
consists of two items, both of which involve MR 17: (1) Transmission
Congestion Compensation and (2) Structural Screen for OP-4 (bid cap) type of
conditions.

Attached is a file containing two exhibits that provide congestion
information that, hopefully, will aid in the group's discussion on the first
item.  With respect to the second item, we will forward to you any materials
we receive.  If you can not make the meeting in person we have arranged for
a conference call.  The dial-in number is as follows:

Telephone Number:  (212) 293-3100
Passcode:  7837367

Thank you.

Don.

Also, attached is the directions to the ISO which show where the Holyoke
Holiday Inn is located.  As you get off 91 North you will see it on your
left just past the gas station at the corner of Whiting Farms Road and Lower
Holyoke Road.  To your right is Holyoke Mall.  If you should have any
questions, please give Susan Dumond a call at (413) 535-4097.

"Pavo, Mike" <mike.pavo@nrgenergy.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE 
Discussion List:

It appears that the scheduling limits between ISONE and NYISO need to be
clarified and/or corrdinated.  I offer the following evidence:

> ISONE transfer limit to NY    = 600mw
> NYISO ATC/TTC posting (import from ISONE)  = 950mw
> NYISO DAM Net Import (from ISONE)   = 800 to 1050mw


1. how can NY resolve in the DAM more imports from ISONE than their own
TTC or more than ISONE's transfer limitation?
> I understand that there is no restriction on a Participant selling DA
and taking the risk of being able to deliver, but surely the software
should recognize the TTC limit and cut/prorate schedules based on price,
down to the TTC limit.  And I would presume that the two ISO's would
agree daily on the TTC limits between their respective pools, thus
ensuring that the DA transfers are always equal to or less than TTC..

2. how can we get the ISO's to coordinate something as simple as
transfer limits?
> At one time in my past life, the limiting control area's limit was the
TTC value used for both CA's....this must be on the SEAMS agenda...

Inquirying minds want to know....

Dear Market Participants:

The NYISO back-up dispatch system is scheduled to be tested on Tuesday,
December 5.    The test will begin at about 10:30 a.m. and last for
approximately one hour.

Security Constrained Dispatch (SCD) will be stopped, but the mainframe 
computer
will
continue to operate, allowing the NYISO to monitor security.  If a situation
occurs, the
Shift Supervisor will be able to re-start SCD and take appropriate action.  
The
Market
Information System (MIS) and Balancing Market Evaluation (BME) will remain
available
during the test.

If you have any questions, please call Customer Relations  at 518-356-6060.

Guys,

A couple of things to consider as you make plans for the meeting (end of 
April to early May, 2002) in Flagstaff, AZ.  You should probably take a rough 
count on attendees and confirm with the hotel there the meeting dates.  You 
should factor in any meetings that might interfere in that time frame (i.e., 
Managers/Directors Meeting, etc.).  Possibly Amelia Alder can tell you when 
any meetings like that might occur.   If you don't reserve space at the 
Little America (example: the time slot, meeting room and 60 hotel rooms, 
etc.) - you may find yourself blocked out by a convention or some other 
gathering that has the hotel booked.

Also, you should check with Kim Ladish to make sure Randy does not have any 
blockage for the dates you select.  Before you know it the time slots will 
fill up for guys like Randy.  

Also, I would approve and supply funding for your conservative purchase of 
some gift item from the Signature Shop (with Enron logo) for the attendees to 
take away from the meeting (enough to share with our SW Operating Partners 
that will join us for the second day of the meeting).  We can discuss what 
will be appropriate.  

A little planning ahead may save you some headaches later on, especially if 
you don't tie down the hotel space you will need for the meeting.  I believe 
you will have to get pre-approval from the Enron group that has to approve a 
meeting of this magnitude.  

John Shafer

I received word from the TNRCC that they will allow a portable emissions test 
at the Spraberry C/S to confirm that the replacement of the fuel mixers with 
carbureators will not cause an increase in emissions.  I will send out the 
letter today to the TNRCC reqesting written approval to do the testing.  I 
would strongly recommend that the Spraberry Team have the sampling ports 
installed on the unit that they select to be tested and have this testing 
completed ASAP.  Remember, the unit selected must be tested with the fuel 
mixer on and then remove the mixer and conduct a test with the carbureator 
on.  Whoever performs the portable emissions testing will need to ensure that 
we follow a portocol that I will submit to the state.

The Texas RailRoad Commission (TRC)  has sent a guideline for cleanup of 
condensate spills to its District Offices for implementation on July 1, 
2000.  Attached is the guideline which is titled,  

Field Guide for the Assessment and Cleanup of Soil and Groundwater 
Contaminated with Condensate From a Spill Incident (Statewide Rules 8, 20, 
and 91)

The introduction to the guideline states that it establishes bench marks and 
protocols that, when met and followed, will demonstrate that condensate 
spills have been addressed in a manner that complies with Statewide Rules 8, 
20, and 91.

Some comments related to this guideline from an industry association meeting 
in mid-July are listed below:

There appeared to be a wide variation in response of the districts to this 
guideline.

The TRC is receiving landowner compliants.  The TRC has gone out and found 
spills not cleaned up, where closure reports have been submitted.  

Parts of the guideline are not clear and the groundwater classification is 
not consistent with TRRP.  A revised guideline might be issued by TRC.

This condensate guideline is temporary until RBCA guidelines are available.  
TRC is working on a software model projected by the end of this year.

Also attached is another guideline that the TRC issued at the same time, 
which is titled:

Field Guide for Reportable Surface Releases of Crude Oil in Non-sensitive 
Areas (Statewide Rules 8, 20, and 91).

In a somewhat related item, the General Land Office on June 23, 2000 issued 
revised penalty guidelines (attached) effective August 1st for oil spills in 
Texas coastal waters.  Spills of less than a gallon will have fines of $250.  
The fines for larger spills will depend on factors such as the size of the 
spills, the number of unauthorized discharges in the past twelve-month 
period, and whether a Sound Management Practice or like program is in place.

That's great Larry. I understand that we can not do anything in the by-pass
channel and this will be made clear in the environmental orientation
Monday. If we don't get compensation credits, insurance certificates and
written approval from the Fish and Game for trapping we can not proceed any
father than the carrot field. Once we get the approvals the plan is to
clear right of way and string pipe week ahead. The by-pass channel is a
month into the project.

Kenny, I have contacted the agencies for which permits and approvals were
requested and have been given the green light to initiate the Rogas
project.  Please understand that IN NO WAY can we initiate activities
associated with the bypass channel construction until approval is given by
each agency contacted.  I will apprise you as the approvals are received or
if further information is requested by each agency.  Enjoy digging in the
carrot field.

Subject:  Re: Rogas Pipelines



Kenny, as you may know, there were 9 environmental applications submitted
to various local, state, and regional agencies requesting approval to
initiate this project and most of the requests apply to crossing the bypass
channel.   As of today, we have received one approval, and that from the
State Fire Marshall, Office of Pipeline Safety granting us a waiver so that
we can lay the pipe above ground as opposed to below ground.  I have calls
into  the other agencies  for which applications and requests were
submitted but have had no reply.  I would caution that we might get into
trouble for initiating a construction project without consent and approval
from a particular agency, as agencies many times look at an entire project
even though their jurisdiction may only apply in one specific area of a
project.  This is particularily the case in air permitting where an
applicant can not even construct a road or bring in construction materials
until the air permit is issued.  Because this is my first project in
California, Id like to be sure of this and make follow up calls to all
agencies for which applications and requests were submitted and verify that
we can initiate the construction, as long as we dont impact a specific  or
strategic portion (ie  the bypass channel)  for sometime down the road when
we are well into the project.   Ill call you tomorrow and let you
know.......

Subject:  Rogas Pipelines


We are going to start the Rogas project Monday 03/12/2001. The first 2500
ft leaving Rogas is across a carrot field that has been harvested and is
not in any habitat. The farmer is due to start working the field the 24th
so we need to get the pipe laid. The contractor is going to start with a
reduced crew and expects to be finished crossing the initial 2500 ft by the
end of the week. The following things must be accomplished early next week
so we can continue construction.

Checks received so we can purchase compensation credits from Kern Water
Bank and Area.

Be added to the KWB's Master Permit. That will happen when they receive
there check.

Insurance certificates in the hands of the Kern County Water Agency and
West Kern Water.

If the contractor has to stop we may be faced with additional mobilization
and demobilization charges.

We have received the water well survey for the N. Crawar site. The Crane 
County Water District owns 11 water wells within a one mile radius of the 
site. The nearest well is located about 1000 feet east of the site. It 
appears that all of the wells are completed into the uppermost aquifer and, 
in general, are screened from 50' bgs to total depth at about 140' bgs. The 
shallow water table at the site and in the nearby wells is at about 50' bgs. 
The groundwater flow direction at the site has consistently been toward due 
south. There are no water supply wells within one mile due south of the site. 
There are two monitor wells at the east side of the site which have always 
produced clean samples. The remediation system for this site should be 
operational by April 1, 2001. We will also have more current groundwater 
sampling information for the site within the next few weeks.

"Palazzo, William" <William.Palazzo@nypa.gov> writes to the 
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

In response to some E-mails on the subject report we offer the following
comments.  We believe expressing the locational requirement as a function of
the capability period peak sends a better price signal to LSE's.  Some LSE
loads will have larger peak in summer and others may be balanced or even
peak in the winter.  Seasonal ICAP would facilitate capacity exchanges
between summer and winter peaking areas.

As a practical matter the requirement can be expressed any way.   For this
exercise we just left it as a percentage of the summer peak because it
provides a reference point to the current requirement and illustrates an
order of magnitude of the potential reduction in the winter requirement that
may be justified through an examination of the seasonal risk.   We agree
completely that all issues, including deficiency charges, modeling, etc.,
must be considered in any methodological change.  There was no intent to
suggest everything else would remain unchanged.

Notes from TXOGA and TCC committee meetings:

Operating Permits - TNRCC is attempting to obtain EPA approval of their Title 
V operating permit program by including Minor New Source Review (NSR) (e.g., 
permits by rule) in the operating permit program. The TNRCC idea is that you 
would make changes or install equipment under a permit by rule as you do now 
under current rules. When your Title V permit is renewed, all Minor NSR 
approvals would be rolled into the permit and included in the renewed permit. 
They are also putting together a General Operating Permit (GOP) that would 
include Minor NSR. It is unknown if EPA will buy this concept.

Upset and Maintenance - A general note: The TNRCC field offices are giving 
different answers to questions that have been asked by industry about the new 
upset and maintenance rules. 

When reporting upset emissions, TNRCC wants you to report all pollutants, not 
just the ones that exceeded the RQs;
It is important to give as much detail as possible on the cause of an upset. 
"Operator error" is not acceptable to TNRCC and may make it more likely you 
will be investigated by TNRCC if you repeatedly give this as a cause since it 
may appear to the agency that this is a repeat problem that a company is not 
correcting;
TNRCC's Region 12 (Houston Area) is conducting inspections at 20 facilities 
specifically directed at upset notifications. The inspections take about two 
days. Companies are inspected if they make too many upset notifications or 
too few.
When reporting a release of natural gas (unspeciated), you should exclude 
methane and ethane from the reporting and calculation of determining the 
5,000 pound threshold, but according to TNRCC you cannot exclude CO2 or N2;
If you do speciate a release, remember that heptane and nonane are not listed 
pollutants so they default to a 100 pound RQ.

New Source Review - TNRCC has lifted their hold on NSR permits in the Houston 
non-attainment area, but if there are too many permit applications between 
now and December 6 (to beat the new non-attainment regulations that should 
pass on December 6) there is a chance that they will put another hold on 
permits.

EPA Enforcement Priorities - EPA has proposed their enforcement priorities 
for Fiscal Year 2002-3 and they include "fuels management". Fuels management 
is broadly defined to include many industries and includes pipelines. It is 
not believed that this directive is aimed at gas pipelines, but it is broad 
enough to include them.

Lou/Ed, attached is a spreadsheet that contains environmental action items
concerning the NCL FRACTIONATOR. These items are the result of the
consolidated audit performed at NCL in NOVEMBER 2000 by ETS. As per your
request, I am informing you of these action items which I think KOCH may be
responsible for. Please review and advise myself and Larry Campbell as to
how you would like to approach these issues.
Thanks for your help,

Scott, you are right, these items were identified by Bill Osborn during
consolidated audit of the North Coles Levee.  As you remember,  we spoke to
Louie about getting started with a drilling program to formally close each
of the suspected areas of contamination.  At his recommendation and  due to
the issue of Koch's responsibility for some of the issues that were
identified, he was going to discuss this with Ed Attanasio before you and I
were to get started on initiating the subsurface investigation.  Im not
sure where Louie is on this, but  the completion date you  show in the
attachment for the action items are 6/30/01.   This gives us about two
months to complete the drilling program.  Thanks for staying on top of
this......

Larry, here is a list of audit items that I believe that Ed Attanasio and
Lou Saldono need to address with KOCH. Please review  comment on these
items, I will then send the finalized list and any comments to both Ed &
Lou.
Thanks,

Subject: RE: mea culpa



  Public Statement by the Rev. Jesse Jackson

  Due to the great consternation caused by the
  revelation of my act of procreation, I accept my
  obligation to give an explanation to the
  population for my act of copulation.

  I gave in to temptation, for the anticipation of
  sexual gratification, that I could not obtain through
  masturbation, resulted in my fornication.
   I accepted her invitation, and provided her with
  excitation, stimulation, penetration, replication, and
  liberation.

  She provided lubrication (to avoid inflammation) and I
  wore condoms to avoid contamination. She cried  for
  duplication but I insisted upon
  termination, in spite of her fascination with
  variation.

  This has caused me great aggravation, and the
  agitation and provocation of the media has resulted in
  my humiliation, denigration, and
  degradation. My wife is considering castration, which
  would require my hospitalization.

  Pray that this matter will find culmination in my
  sanctification and rehabilitation so that my plans for
  nomination to my ultimate vocation will not result in
  revocation and termination.I hope this proclamation
  has provided illumination and verification and will
  prohibit further provocation (or investigation).

  Sincerely,
  The Rev. Jesse Jackson

IF there is no increase in emissions, this is probably not a modification
and the Grandfathered status would remain.  They would need to demonstrate

Mr. Stewart, as per you voice mail request to me on Feb. 20, 2001, attached 
is the correspondance concerning the reqeust to replace the mixing valves 
with carbuerators at the Northern Natural Gas, Spraberry Plant.   The players 
in this activity included Jon Fields of Argent Consulting.  Due to the fact 
that the pre testing data for the emissions from the mixing valves and the 
post testing data for emissions from the carbuerators were received in hard 
copy only, I am not able to provide this as an attachment.  This data was, 
however, sent to you via fed-x on January 24, 2001.  If needed, I can 
resubmit the results of the data for your review.   As expected, the 
emissions levels did decrease when the carbs were installed. 

Please reveiw the attached correspondance concerning the request to replace 
the mixing valves at the Spraberry Plant (TNRCC account No. ML-0022-W) with 
carbuerators without requiring involvement of a permitting activity.  Thank 
you for your consideration in this issue.

Jon, Here's the latest comment from Jim:
don't see why a test before the change and after the change using the same
analyzer would not demonstrate no increase in emissions.

Duncan,
Ok.  We'll test an engine.  This project involves 5 identical engines.  We
want to test just one - will you accept that?  Will you accept portable
analyzer test results?  These analyzers have been certified by the state of
New Mexico to be plus/minus 3% from full trailer tests.
Thanks,
Jon

Hi Jon,
This is a joint Duncan - Jim Linville reply.
First, for all intents and purposes, expect GF status to go away when the
legislature comes back to town.  With that in mind, what exactly is
happening with this engine.  Does the carburetor replace the mixer valves?
 If so, this must be one ancient engine!  And unlikely to get in under VERP
or any other program designed to end GF status.  Tell us more.
Duncan
>>> Jon Fields <jfields@argentinc.com> 08/22/00 11:05AM >>>
Duncan,
I have some grandfathered gas compressor engines in west Texas.  We are
going to change out the old mixer valves and install carburetors on the
units as a maintenance activity.  Horsepower and emissions will not
increase.  I can maintain my grandfathered status, correct?  We will of
course document this activity and provide copies to the regional office.
Thanks,
Jon Fields

Jon and Ruth, presented below are the comments to the air perimts at 3 and 
4.  Please review for clairty and content.  I have spoken to Roger Kohn about 
all of these issues and the only one which may be a problem is with No. 2.  
He is checking on what the EPA can do about this.  I have spoken to Arnold 
Eisenstein about what we can do with the strict 25 ppmvd requriement for NOx 
and CO and he has said that we can hold to the 25 ppm value by doing some 
major gas recycling.  This is a fuel waste and costly.  Anyway, depending 
upon how long this issue delays the issuance of the permit will undoubtably 
determine whether we give in to the 25 ppmvd or hold out for 40 ppmvd.  Id 
like your comments asap.


          1.  The responsible official name change to  Danny Pribble.

                         2.. The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to 
25 ppmv at 15% O2, based on a 3-hour average, except during periods of 
startup   and shutdown.  At 60F and above the GE data indicates that these 
rates are achievable under all operating conditions.  However, GE   data 
indicates that NOx and CO may be as high as 40 ppmv during low-load 
conditions of 60%and lower.

 The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of 
the time with reduced load operations (64% load) occurring  no more than 20% 
of the time.  The potential to emit calculations presented the emissions in 
the application in units of lb.hr and ton/yr.  These values were accepted by 
the EPA for the netting analysis, and  took were taken into account by the 
EPA (See EPA Statement  of Basis document).  Because the permit conditions 
hold us to ppmvd values and not lb/yr or ton/year values, Transwestern is   
concerned that under low load conditions of less than 60%, the emissions of 
NOx and CO would be 40 ppmvd.  Transwestern is  requesting that  a provision 
be made in the permit conditions that  emissions of NOx and CO be held to 40 
ppmvd during the 20 % of  the time that the turbines operating conditions is 
less than or equal to 60%.

3. The word "Catepillar" is mispelled throughout the permit.

4. Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas requires Transwestern 
to use methodologies (wet chemistry technology) that are not     normally 
used to monitor and measure sulfur in the natural gas.  Transwestern has 
received approval from the EPA for other custom  fuel monitoring schedules to 
use  "GPA Standard 2377" (length of stain tube) or gas chromatography as the 
proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in the natural gas.

At or before the May 16th meeting in Hicksville, there is some basic
information that is needed for marketers to determine their regulatory risk
in accepting capacity from KeySpan East and West. KeySpan must provide , in
detail, for all transportation contracts (East and West) the following
information:

 - Max. Daily Quantity
 - Telescoping (Receipt and Delivery Points/ Amounts available at
different delivery points)
 - Rate Schedules
 - Pipeline
 - Start Date
 - End Date
 - Current Rates (Demand, Variable, Fuel %, Surcharges)
 - Any proposed pipeline rate changes that take effect in the next
year (effective Date)
 - Map the gas flow of contracts, if transportation feeds into other
transportation contracts.
 - Identify contracts used for storage W/D or Inj.
 - Identify historical (past 24 months) geographic basis differential
to the NYMEX for each receipt point on the different transportation
contracts

KeySpan should explain the contractual and operational restrictions for not
releasing a slice of the system. The percentage of secondary delivery
capacity needs to be defined and KeySpan should inform marketers of any
preliminary negations for incremental purchases and the pricing terms to
serve the firm market.

Bill, things have pretty much quieted down on Rogas as compared to the last 
couple of weeks, but heres whats new:

A meeting has been scheduled on 3/16 with the California Fish and Game to 
discuss the following issues:  1)presentaiton of the 1999 and 2000 annual 
reports which are required by the facility's 2081 permit. 2) developing an 
agreement with F&G as to how the 41 acre credits held by EOTT will be managed 
to ensure compliance with requirements of the F&G. 3) Presentation of the 
results relating to surveys conducted in the path of construction for the 
Rogas project.

The waiver to lay pipeline above ground for the Rogas constsruction was 
approved by the Offfice of the State Fire Marshall, Pipeline Safety 
Division.  There were 8 city, county, state and federal agencies notified by 
application for approval to construct the 9 mile pipline system consisting of 
3 piplines.  This is the only agency approval received as yet.

Acre credits were obtained from Aera for the construction of the Rogas 
pipeline.  Aera is an oil company with major holdings of acreage available 
for purchase.  It was felt that due to the time constraints for initiating 
this project and the concern with not receiving the credits from the F&G that 
EOTT would purchase Aera credits to ensure procurement of the necessary 
acreage for the Rogas project.  This is a major plus for the project.

Atttended the NMOGA meeting in Farmington, NM.  It appears that the BLM will 
implement its own noise criteria in areas within New Mexico that are deemed 
sensitive by the BLM.  The proposed noise threshold will be 48.6 DBA(A).  
There are no Transwestern facilities in the Farmington resource area which 
will be impacted by this proposed level, however the potential exists for 
several Transwestern locations in southeast New Mexico to be impacted.  

A meeting was held with the president of Del Mar, concerning the issues 
associated with the lead in their lead acetate tape for monitoring sulfur 
concentrations in the natural gas.  A  request  was made to the company to 
determine the feasability of recycling the tape and eleviate the management 
and disposal issues associated with the tape as a hazardous waste.  

The quarterly SoCal Transwestern PCB conference call was held this week.  
Transwesten's share (86%) of SoCal's PCB management activities was approx. 
$79,000.  Due to the press release  by PG&E concerning the increased 
occurance of PCB's into their system, SoCal has initiated increased sampling 
activities on their system and will be proposing to do additional monitoring 
to track liquids from Transwestern's M/S into the SoCal system.  Preliminary 
sampling results at strategic liquids locations on the SoCal system has 
revealed hits of PCB's in the range of 7-10 ppm, although, a  hit of 77 ppm  
was discovered.  

As a result of an isolated hit of PCB's into the new filter separator at the 
PG&E C/S in excess of regulated levels, a  conference call was held the ET&S 
VP to determine forthcoming activities with PG&E.  A meeting has been 
scheduled at the PG&E C/S next week to reveiw sampling on the PG&E system and 
discuss the recent hit of PCB's in the F/S and what forthcoming activities 
will be conducted at the site.

Jerry,
I just spoke with Steve Burr (he had been in Kingman last two days dealing 
with county air issues and town council). He was unequivocal that we could 
not construct buildings and foundations because these are "activities ... of 
a permanent nature." This phrasing is from the definition of "begin actual 
construction" (ARS 49-401.01(5)), which is not allowed for modificastion of a 
major source until the permit is issued. In our discussion last week, Steve 
was suggesting that we could do this if we had a "minor" source, but Larry 
corrected our thinking, stating  that the equipment emits more than 250 tons 
per yr NOx, which is the threshhold between "major" and "minor" source.
Our strategy now is to make sure that everyone keeps to the schedule, as set 
forth in your Sept 28 letter to Nancy. It will be especially important to 
send the EPA materials to Prabhat (copy of cover letter to Nancy and Cathy, 
copy also me) as quickly as possible and then to make sure that the meetings 
scheduled for this Friday (Oct 5) occur; let me know if I can help bird-dog 
anything.
When Sara can get me more details about the Idaho "fast-track" policy, I will 
pass this on to Steve Burr to see if there is any interest in integrating 
some of these ideas for natural gas transmission lines, which is the shortage 
problem in Arizona (current glut is built/permitted/under construction 
generation facilities).
Van

>>> <Jerry.D.Martin@enron.com> 10/2/2001 8:14:58 PM >>>
Van, were you ever able to talk to Steve Burr to clarify the extent of
acceptable pre-permit construction activities?  I still know that I heard
from Nancy that we could build "anything that doesn't have emissions," and
I'm not ready to give up yet -- still trying to mitigate the late
acquisition of the permit.  And, they pay me to worry about things that can
go wrong in construction.

Thanks,
Jerry

We are pleased to announce the creation of a new group - Asset Marketing - 
within Enron Americas. The Asset Marketing group will have responsibility for 
the asset divestment function within Enron Americas and work with Generation 
Investments on selected portfolio acquisitions as well as managing power 
origination funding requirements with Treasury.   

Don Miller will head the Asset Marketing group and will report directly to 
the Office of the Chair, Enron Americas. Joining Don's group will be Stuart

After the Topock line has been cleaned and placed back in service, I 
recommend immediate flushing with diesel.
The existing Selexol tank and injection system can be used for this purpose. 
HYSIM simulations verify the existing high pressure injection pump is a good 
fit for the quantity of diesel to be added on a continuous basis, 
(approximately 1 B/D).  Inject  1 or 2 barrels of diesel in front of each pig 
to begin with.  I would buy diesel No. 2 because it has a wider boiling point 
range than No. 1.  The diesel should be analyzed for PCB content  before we 
purchase /inject.

The above guideline should be adjusted based on the actual volume of liquids 
seen at the meter station filter separator.  If you can keep a small but 
continuous amount of free liquids at this separator , the gas will be 
saturated with heavy hydrocarbons which will dilute and flush PG&E's 
downstream system.

1 to 2 Barrel per day of diesel injected into 200 MMSCF/D has a major effect 
on the C7+ concentration  in the gas stream and on the hydrocarbon dew point. 
Most of the hydrocarbons in diesel  are naturally ocurring to some extent in 
natural gas. The carbon number for diesel ranges from about C10 to C 20 with 
a corresponding boiling point of 350 oF to 650 oF.  It is anticipated that 
some of the heavier hydrocarbons in the C18 to C20 range will  drop out along 
with compressor oil carryover to substantially increase the amount of liquid 
PG&E sees in their downstream drips.  The net effect of this is a substantial 
reduction of the PCB concentration.  I would expect that after 30 to 60 days 
of continuous injection the PCB contaminant level should drop by an order of 
magnitude.

The reason I would not inject Selexol after the pipeline has been cleaned is 
because you would  leave a finite quantity of Selexol coating the pipeline 
which could  then absorb and concentrate any potential PCB contaminant in the 
gas and potentially  recontaminate downstream equipment.

I will be on vacation from June 19 to June 26.  If you have any questions 
please call.

Just a short note to let you know that I received a call from Rod Bosche of 
PG&E apprising me of a meeting PG&E will be having with SW Gas this tuesday.  
They will be discussing PCB issues and the sampling results from the PG&E 
system.   From discussions with Louie, a media statement is being prepared by 
them which Louie has a copy of.  The statement is a little harsh and makes 
some statements which are incorrect.  Louie and I are planning to attend this 
meeting in Las Vegas to possibly assist in making some suggestions about 
rewording their statement and provide some additional insight and history on 
the Transwestern system with respect to PCB's.  The results of this meeting 
will be forwarded at a later date.....

As per your request, an environmental due diligence was completed of the 
assets and outstanding issues of Northwest Natural Gas Company (NWNG), a 
local distribution company  (LDC), with its corporate headquarters located in 
Portand, Oregon.  This  due diligence, which was conducted on August 7-9, 
2001,  was performed to determine the environmental liabilities and exposures 
which may be associated with  NWNG and identify and evaluate the 
environmental risks associated with each issue.  A relative risk number 
between 0 and 3 has been assigned to each discipline to evulate the potential 
risk impact.  A rating of "0" indicates that there is no risk associated with 
this regulation or issue and a rating of "3" indicates a major problem or an 
issue that has a potential long term risk or exposure.  An approximate cost  
value has also been assigned to each discipline.   It is to be understood and 
explicitly stated that in the calculation of each cost, conservative 
estimates were used to determine a dollar value to repair, remediate or 
formally close each issue. 

Presented below, by discipline, are the environmental activities which impact 
and affect NWNG.  The evualtion and written discussion of each disicpline is 
based upon the availability of records, documents and discussions with NWNG 
personnel.  Therefore, this summary report is limited to the availability of 
information presented.

General Pipeline Characteristics ;

This is a dry pipeline system.  No pipeline liquids are generated, only small 
volumes of compressor oils are collected.
All cast iron pipe has been removed from the system.  There is still approx. 
100 miles of steel pipe which will be repalced in the near future.  
The only location where horsepower and compression exists is at Mist Storage, 
and underground injection and storage reservoir (10.5 bcf storage capacity). 
this is a non Title V major source.
NWNG is planning additional property acquisitions to increase their 
underground storage capacity. 
NWNG is planning a 60 mile pipeline construction project to begin in fall of 
2002.  All environmental studies have been completed and sumbmitted to the 
agencies.
Landslide hazards appear to be the biggest pipeline safety concern.  NWNG has 
completed a study to locate and identify high potential landslide areas.    

Environmental Procedures Manual.   The NWNG environmental procedures manual  
appeared to be comprehensive and in a easily understood format.  The topics 
covered in the manual addressed all environmenatl issues that the company 
appeared to be involved with.  The manual addressed waste management, 
permitting,  disposal and environmetal stewardship.  There was also a written 
statement from management supporting and attesting to NWNG's commitment to 
enhancing and promoting a clean environment in all activities by NWNG. 
Risk: 0  Cost: $0

Notices of Violation (NOV)/Notices of Noncompliance (NON).   In a summary 
page provided by NWNG, a list of all state and federal agency actions against 
the company was available.  Although the company had received a few  notices 
(<10), they were of a very minor nature and involved mostly small 
recordkeeping and right of way issues.  There were no outstanding judgements, 
NOVs, NONs or pending agency actions or  issues to be resoved.  
Risk: 0  Cost: $0 

PCBs.  In interviews with NWNG, they attested to the fact that they have 
never used PCBs on their pipeline and that PCBs have never been detected.  
Although NWNG is an LDC and receives its gas from Northwest Pipeline Company, 
the status of PCBs on the Northwest pipeline system  was unknown.
Risk:  1  Cost: $0        

Mercury.   Mercury was used on the NWNG system, but only in monometers and 
not in natural gas metering equipment.  A decision was made by environmental 
management of NWNG in 1986-87 to remove mercury manometers.  An investigation 
has never been initiated to determine mercury releases from broken manometers 
or potential mercury releases from old historic mercury containing equipment 
which may have been used. 
Risk:  1  Cost:  $3,000-$40,000

Onsite Disposal.  Other than the issues surrounding the manufactured gas 
plants, in interviews with NWNG's environmental management, they were not 
aware of any onsite waste disposal of any hazardous, toxic or non hazardous 
waste.
Risk:   1  Cost:   undefined

Hazardous Waste.  There is only one location where hazardous waste is 
generated and this location is a service center where a small parts washer is 
used.  This site is classified as a conditionally exempt small quantity 
generator.  The remainder of the NWNG system is a non generator of hazardous 
waste.
Risk: 0  Cost:  0 

NORMS.  The environmental management of NWNG has stated that natrually 
occurring radioactive materials (NORMS) are not a problem in the pipeline 
system.  Tesing has not been completed to verify or confirm this, nor does 
NWNG have evidence to determine NORM status from Northwest  Pipeline Company.
Risk:  1  Cost:  $500

Underground Storage Tanks (UST).  There is only one regulated underground 
storage tank (UST) remaining on the NWNG system (Albany), and this tank is in 
complance with the UST regualtions for monitoring, testing and 
recordkeeping.  All other underground tanks have been removed.  At one of the 
tank removal sites, there exists  an active remediation in progress.  Closure 
of this site is expected in the near future.
Risk: 1  Cost: $500

LNG plants.  In interviews with NWNG environmental management, there are no 
histoirc or present outstanding environmental issues at the liquified natural 
gas (LNG)  plants.  The exception to this is a historic site of a 
manufactured gas plant (Linnton site) which underlies the LNG plant.  This 
issue will be addressed under the section of the Linnton Manufactured Gas 
Plant. 
Risk: 0  Cost:  $0

Manufactured Gas Plants.  NWNG owned and operated  a number of manufactured 
gas plants (MGPs).  Presented below are the MGP sites that NWNG owned or had 
operating interest in for which there are associated liabilites and risks.

 Eugene Water and Electrical Board. The City of Eugene has determined that  a 
parcel of property within the city has been contaminated by   numerous 
responsible parties of which NWNG owned and operated a MGP during the time 
period of 1958-1976.  The Eugene Water and Electrical Board  (EWEB), which is 
the regulatory agency in Eugene,  has determined that the total cost to clean 
the entire area will be approximately $1,300,000, of which  the EWEB has 
indicated that NWNGs responsibility will be $93,750.  NWNG has offered to pay 
compensation damages in the amount of $70,000-90,000 to  be relaesed from all 
liability and damages associated with the contamination impacts to the City 
of Eugene.   The environmental management of NWNG  has stated that the EWEB 
has verbally and in principal agreed with the NWNG  offer of approximately 
$94,000.
 Risk: 1-2 Cost:  $94,000

 Salem Site. According to NWNG management, this historic MGP site has been 
remediated and formally closed by the City of Salem, which is the   
regulatory agency with jurisdiction over this site.  NWNG has received 
endemnification and written closure from the City of Salem for this feature.  
 Risk: 1   Cost: $0

 Manufactured Gas Plant. This site, which ceased operation in the early 
1900's, was dismantled and  abandoned.  From the time the facility ceased  
operations, untill the present, a railroad has constructed a steel rail 
bridge over the site and the City of Portland and constructed a city park.  
The site is  immediately adjacent ot he Wilammette River, a major perennial 
watercourse in Oregon.  There have been no soil, groundwater or river/ river 
sediment   studies  completed  to determine potential environmental impacts.  
NWNG environmental personnel have stated that the site was insured by Lloyds 
of  London.  The insurance policies were not available at the time of this 
due diligence to determine policy applicability and coverage amounts for this 
site.
 Risks: 2-3 Costs: 0-$300,000,000

Portland Harbor Superfund Site.  The Environmetnal Protection Agency has 
determined that the Portland Harbor, on the Wilammette River,  has received 
contamination of a sufficient nature and magnitude to warrent and classify 
the 6.7 miles of the Harbor as a Superfund site.  This superfund site extends 
for a distance of 6.7 miles and includes the Linnton and Wacker sites, 
originally owned by NWNG.  The EPA has designated approximately 69 primary 
responsible parties  which are directly or indirectly involved in the 
contamination of this section of the Willamette River.  NWNG has been 
identified as a contributing member to the contamination.

 Linnton MGP/Wacker Site.   The Linnton MGP and Wacker Site, has 47 acres of 
water front exposure on the Wilammette River and is included in the  Portland 
Harbor Superfund Site.  The Linnton facility, which originally included the 
Wacker Site,  initiated operation in 1913 and ceased operation in 1956.   
During the operation of the  facility operation,  various organic coal tar 
wastes, comprised of light non aqueous phase liquids (LNAPLs) and dense non  
aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) were generated.  Characteristically these 
waste products include: polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), BTEX  and 
cyanide.  During the early stages of facility operation, these wastes  were 
originally directly deposited into the Willammette River, and then later, in  
1941 unlined ponds were constructed at the facility.  Preliminary 
investigation reports of the volumes of regulated waste from the facility 
operations which  were released either directly or indirectly into the soil 
underlying the facility or into the Wilamette  River were in excess of 4.6 
million gallons or 23,000 cubic  yards.   It was also estimated from these 
reports that there is approximately 250,000 cubic yards of tar and tar mixed 
with soil underlying the historic tar  ponds.  

 Negotiations for cleanup and closure of this site may take up to 20 or more 
years.  NWNG has stated that it has insurance policies from Lloyds of 
London   which they feel will cover all costs assciated with NWNG's portion 
of this superfund responsibility.  The policies were not availble during the 
due diligence  to verify or confirm the amount of coverage.  Additionally, 
because the horizontal and vertical extent of the contamination in the 
subsurface soil,   groundwater and in the Willamette River sediments has not 
been determined, it seems unlikely that insurance coverage can adequatley be 
evaluated.   It  should also be mentioned that because the proportionate 
extent of NWNGs contamination responsibility is not known, adequate insurance 
coverage  appears to be somewhat premature. 
 Risk:  3  Cost:  $50,000,000-300,000,000

Subject: It costs so little and means so much

As you are probably aware, if voting results in Florida stand as they
are now, George W. Bush will be our next President.
This will have catastrophic results in our vital -- no, indispensable

entertainment industry. Barbra Streisand, Martin Sheen, Susan Sarandon,
Whoopie Goldberg, Alec Baldwin -- among many others -- have sworn to leave
the country if George W. Bush is elected President.
And this is where YOU can help.  We need volunteers to help pack and
to
load moving vans.  We also need airfare for these irreplaceable national
treasures so they can relocate before they change their minds.
For the cost of a small SUV, you can sponsor one of these celebrities
and their unfortunate relocation.
You will know that your efforts are helping when you receive
postcards,
letters and pictures from your chosen "refugee" as they learn to become a
useful citizen in the Third World country of their choosing.
You will help, won't you?  It costs so little but it means so much.

Call 1-800-deport-a-lib.  Operators are standing by.  Major credit
cards
are accepted.

 Just to follow up, did you send a letter to Van Ryn at Koch re the 
hydrocarbon and mercury contaminations?  If so, could you please send me a 
copy?

 Also, have you been able to come up with any further info on what to do 
about the other soil contamination areas?  Do you still want to determine the 
full lateral and vertical extent of all?  FYI, I have made further inquiry as 
to whether we have any reporting or investigatory duties based upon the 
levels in the WZI report.  I believe the numbers you cited in you 5/21 email 
may be only part of the story: as you have appropriately noted, in California 
it is not only concentration levels that matter; rather, other variables such 
as depth to groundwater, proximity to population centers, etc. determine 
whether any reporting or remedial (including further investigatory) 
obligations arise.  Therefore, I'm checking further to see how these other 
variable impact our legal obligations here.  (Again, I think this is very 
important inour case because we want to be careful about potenially 
jeopardizing our indemnity rights against Koch by performing any Phase 
II-type activities where not legally required.

 I expect to have more info on this by the end of the week.  Perhaps we can 
chat then?  Thanks. --ETA

Larry- Thanks for the update. I am glad that the operating hours in the 
alternative scenario for BOTH STATIONS are agreeable to Transwestern. I will 
be sending the permits to EPA review today with a request for an expedited 
review.

The public notice period starts today, so i trust that the notice signs are 
posted outside your facilities.

Shudeish, the spreadsheets look great.  I spoke to the project engineer
about an hour ago and he told me that we can live with the numbers you have
given us in the permits for Stations 1 and 2 under the alternate operating
scenerio.  He has been in Boliva for the past 2 weeks and was unavailable
for comments.  Please accept my gratitude for all the extra work and effort
you have put in on this issue of operating hour under the alternative
operating scenerio.  We are going to accept the hours as stated in the
permits.  Thanks very much

Scheduled for 11/30/00 & 12/5/00
Change type - Enhancement
Description:
Import Bilateral Fix.  Changes to billing software were made to
balance import transactions in real time for Balancing TUC's and
Balancing LBMP, and to calculate the balancing of load buses in
real time where imports are settled at what they were bid, not at
what they are scheduled.  The change was not factored in the June
re-bill.

The 12/05/00 backup dispatch test is the regularly scheduled
monthly test done by Operations.

recent transfer in ownership of Indian Point 3; the DNI values for
that unit will be included in the DNI calculation for ConEd's
region.
Real-time systems will be modified to send 10-minute SCD
basepoints during reserve pickups in place of the 6 second UDG
basepoints, to units via ICCP and Bisync communications .

Dear Market Participants,

Please help the NYISO "clean house" so we can start our
next year of operations with an up-to-date database of
active digital certificate holders.

You may receive multiple copies of this messages - if so,
it indicates you have multiple certificates.  No action is
needed in this case.

Please notify me of persons who may have had a
certificate but have left your company, or have other
responsibilities within your company such that they no
longer need or use their certificate.

Thank you,
Pete Morrison

marketer of crude oil and NGL's in the US and Canada.
Is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron Corp with approximately 770 
employees
Operates in most major producing areas of the US, serving customers in 18 
states; maintains district offices in over 25 different communities.

Description of Function:
Will conduct analysis to support the development of business opportunities 
related to assets that enhance cash flow.
This includes:
Acquisition of strategic assets and optimization of existing assets;
Working closely with the Director of Business Development in co-ordinating 
the input of business units to identify under-utilized assets and implement 
plans for alternative disposition;
Assisting in formalizing and standardizing post audit procedures;
Analyzing and developing financial and tracking models for capital projects;
Screening proposals for completeness, consistency and accuracy and providing 
required research data as applicable.

Anyone interested in this rotation should contact Lynette LeBlanc at

barkerde@nmenergy.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



After reading Pete's update on MIS changes that will go into effect May 29,  I
have tried the phone route with the NYISO and haven't found a live person to
answer a question I have regarding the $20,000 day ahead adder. The removal of
the $20,000 adder was supposed to be in conjunction with the proposal passed 
by
BIC and MC back in Sept, where the external proxy busses would clear at BME
instead of LBMP. Subsquently it was determined that due to soft ware 
limitations
and the study that long term prices indicated that the BME clearing prices 
would
have big uplift impact since BME averaged higher then the LBMP. The answer was
to automate ECA06B so that when there was congestion that only the proxy bus
effected would clear at BME, in effect eliminating the need for the $20,000
adder. Soooo the question is: Is the automated ECA06B going to be in place May
29?
Another thought along these lines...Will the removal of the $20,000 adder to
non constrained proxy busses pose a problem for those who don't want their DAM
schedules bumped by HAM schedules? Will simply babysitting your schedules by
changing the HAM bids be sufficent?
Since I'm on a roll, what about the fact that according to Tech Bull. 61 that
IS+ is still changing Export Sink Price Caps to a -$100 Dec Bid in spite of 
the
fact that BIC and MC back in Sept passed a motion to change this so that the 
Dec
bid would be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign from the SPC Bid? Which 
is
wrong, Tech Bull 61, IS+ or me? Please only pick one, and it must pertain to
this narrow question.

As  you  know,  Enron  has  signed  a merger agreement by which Dynegy will
acquire  Enron.   We  expect the transaction to close following shareholder
and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even  though  Enron  has  entered  into  this  agreement,  U.S. and foreign
antitrust   laws   require  that  Enron  and  Dynegy  continue  to  operate
independently  of  each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and
Dynegy  are  competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective
activities  must  be  undertaken  at arm's length until the transaction has
closed.   Therefore,  for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you
would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In  addition,  all information, documents and communications related to the
merger  between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved
by  Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls
or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be
maintained.   To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to
Dynegy  under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved
by one of the foregoing individuals.

If  you  have  any  questions  concerning this notice, please contact Lance
Schuler  (713/853-5419),  Robert  Eickenroht  (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke
(713/853-6544)  or  Rob  Walls  (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in
this matter.

Content

On April 4, 2001, we issued a memorandum which included information from
EPA regarding the Agency=01,s current thinking on the draft MACT standards =
for
IC engines and combustion turbines located at major sources of HAP
emissions (see Attachment A of attached file).  Since the distribution of
that memorandum, EPA has provided corrections regarding the compliance
monitoring requirements for the IC Engine MACTs.  The MACT information
provided by EPA, including the latest corrections regarding compliance
monitoring are included in this memorandum.  Clearly, this is preliminary
information and should not be construed as the content of the final rules.
This content could change before these rules are submitted to OMB,
subsequently issued as proposed standards, or promulgated as final rules.

Byron as per the Red Rock expansion conference call today presented below are 
the emissions estimates for the auxillary engines at sta. 1-4.  Understand 
these are not actual emissions, but are emissions based upon potential to 
emit.  When these units were permitted actual testing data was not required, 
so each unit was permitted based upon an accpeted emissions limit from an EPA 
approved document.  This has worked out in our favor as the emisisons numbers 
presented in the EPA document were high, therefore, this will allow us to net 
more emissions, if needed.  Emissions are presented for a single engine only 
in tons per year, even though there are two auxillary units at each facility 
except Sta. 1 where they only have one auxillary unit.

Sta. 1 1- Waukesha 350 Hp LRZ

I received a call from a permit engineer with the Arizona Dept. of 
Environmental Quality (ADEQ) concerning the issue of notification of 
mechanical activities at C/S 2  Flagstaff and a mandatory 7 day wating period 
for agency review and approval.   Due to the urgency of the C/S 2 work being 
performed, I had written a notification to the agency friday evening 
requesting approval to initiate the activities detailed in the scope of work 
which was included with the letter.  On Monday, the engineer called and said 
that he had read the letter and had no problems with the activity proceeding 
at the C/S.  After we had discussed this issue at some length, I posed the 
question to him of whether it was necessary to notify the agency of 
mechanical and maintenace activities which  will not impact or change a 
combustion units throughput, fuel use, emissions, horsepower, or cause a 
change in design.  After some discussions I informed him that Transwestern 
will probably inundate the agency with notification letters, he stated that 
as long as the engines operating parameters would not change, ( horsepower, 
emissions, throughput, fuel use etc), and the burden of responsibility will 
rest on Transwestern to ensure that no permit conditions are violated, he 
stated that we may proceed with these types of activities in Arizona without 
any notification to the agency.   

The only hitch being, that when Transwestern does a major mechanical 
activity, which would cost more than  25-30% of the cost of replacing a unit, 
that we provide them a courtesy notification.  I told them we would apprise 
them of such an activity.....

David-
Two files are attached. The first file is the text and figures of a plan for 
characterizing impacted soil in the former surface impoundment areas. The 
second file contains the attachments to the characterization plan. The 
attachments include copies of soil boring logs and a summary of some previous 
soil sample results. I will also send a hard copy of the plan to you via 
FedEx. Transwestern is ready to proceed upon approval from the NMOCD and the 
NMED HRMB. Please call me if you have any questions or comments.
Thanks,
George

In addition to adjustments to billing units due to the receipt of billing
quality
metering data, this settlement adjustment includes the following billing code
modifications/corrections:

   Billing code was modified to model scheduling & dispatch of grouped
   generators
   for settlement of energy & bid production cost guarantee payments.
   Generators
   affected by this modification should see proper payment of those 
quantities.
   Any
   costs incurred by the NYISO will be recovered from transmission customers
   through
   their OATT Schedule 1 residual & BPCG adjustments
   For the December settlement adjustment, billing code was modified to ensure
   that
   appropriate prices corrections resulting from ECA-B were captured in the
   billing.
   This may impact transmission customers whose transactions were subject to
   ECA-B
   treatment, resulting in transmission usage charge adjustments.  Any costs
   incurred
   by the NYISO will be recovered from transmission customers through their 
OATT
   Schedule 1 residual adjustment.
   For the December settlement adjustment, a number of grandfathered rights &
   TCC
   configurations were corrected.  Customers affected by this would see either
   their
   TCC's converted back to grandfathered rights, or vice versa.  Any excess or
   deficiency
   in cost recovery will be balanced with the Transmission Owners, based upon
   their
   respective megawatt-mile coefficients.
   There was a code modification to allow for Class 2 PURPA generators to sell
   all
   over-generation to the real-time market.  This would result in payment to
   those
   affected suppliers.    Any costs incurred by the NYISO will be recovered 
from
   transmission customers through their OATT Schedule 1 residual adjustment.

Dear Santa: 

Listen you fat little troll, I've been  helping you out every year, playing 
at 
being the perfect Christmas present,  wearing skimpy bathing suits in frigid 
weather, and drowning in fake tea  from one too many tea parties, and I hate 
to break it to ya Santa, but IT'S  DEFINITELY PAYBACK TIME! There had better 
be some changes around here this  Christmas, or I'm gonna call for a 
nationwide meltdown (and trust me, you  won't wanna be around to smell it). 

So, here's my holiday wish list,  Santa: 

1. A nice, comfy pair of sweat pants and a frumpy, oversized  sweatshirt. I'm 
sick of looking like a hooker. How much smaller are these  bathing suits 
gonna 
get? Do you have any idea what it feels like to have  nylon and Velcro 
crawling up your butt? 

2. Real underwear that can  be pulled on and off. Preferably white. What 
bonehead at Mattel decided to  cheap out and MOLD imitation underwear to my 
skin? (It looks like  cellulite). 

3. A REAL man... maybe GI Joe. Hell, I'd take Tickle-Me Elmo  over that 
wimped-out excuse for a boyfriend Ken. And what's with that  earring anyway? 
If I'm gonna have to suffer with him, at least make him and  me anatomically 
correct. 

4. Arms that actually bend so I can push  the aforementioned Ken-wimp away 
once he is anatomically correct. 

5.  Breast reduction surgery. I don't care whose arm you have to twist, just 
get  it done. 

6. A sports bra. To wear until I get the surgery. 

7. A  new career. Pet doctor and school teacher just don't cut it. How about 
a  
systems analyst? Or better yet, an advertising account executive. 

8.  A new, more '90s persona. Maybe "PMS Barbie," complete with a miniature  
container of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and a bag of chips;  
"Animal Rights Barbie," with my very own paint gun, outfitted with a fake  
fur 
coat and handcuffs; or "Stop Smoking Barbie," sporting a removable  Nicotrol 
patch and equipped with several packs of gum. 

9. No more  McDonald's endorsements. The grease is wrecking my vinyl. 

10. Mattel  stock options. It's been 37 years, I think I deserve it. 

OK, Santa,  that's it. Considering my valuable contribution to society, I 
don't think  these requests are out of line. If you disagree, then you can 
find yourself  a new bimbo doll for next Christmas. It's that simple. 

Yours truly,  

Barbie

Shudeish with the state of Arizona just phoned and said that he and Probaht 
Baragava are available to meet with us on Thursday at 2:00 pm.  This is the 
only time and day of this week that they will be able to see us.  I asked 
about whether Kathy OConnell and Nancy Wrona would be able to attend this 
meeting and he stated that their calendars were full this week and would not 
attend.   He will need to know by tomorrow whether to book this meeting and 
who will be attending.  Sarah had mentioned that Thrusday was not a good day 
for her.  Should we schedule this and if so, who will be attending in Sarah's 
place?

Subject: Telephone Conversation with EPA

After the telephone conference call we had on 9/17, I contacted the Roger 
Kohn permit engineer with EPA about a possible meeting with his agency to 
resolve and assist the issuance of the air permits for stations 3 and 4.  His 
message back to me was a reiteration of the last request I made to him, that 
he could see no way that Transwestern would be able to help the EPA in this 
matter.  We discussed the possibility of Transwestern contacting his 
supervisor, Gerardo Rios, about a potential meeting and he indicated that we 
could choose this avenue if we desired. 

Gerardo's telephone number is 415-744-1259.

  At NYPA's request ISO staff conducted a limited analysis of
the winter locational ICAP requirements for Long Island and New York City
areas.  While such ICAP requirements have historically been set as a single
number for the entire year, it is NYPA's belief that this holdover from the
old way of doing business must be re-examined.  It is NYPA's belief that
most if not all of the contribution to loss of load risk occurs in the
summer months.  As such, some reduction in winter ICAP requirements should
be possible with no impact on the Loss of Load criterion of one day in ten
years.

  NYPA requested that the ISO start with the database that
resulted in the locational requirements of 80% and 98% for New York City and
Long Island, respectively.   At NYPA's request the ISO modeled winter
ratings on the transmission interfaces into NYC and LI and determined how
much the 80% and 98% could be reduced in the winter before any impact on the
statewide Loss Of Load  occurred.  The report indicates that winter
requirements of 75% and 92% of the summer peak load resulted for NYC and LI,
respectively.

 While this in no way reflects an exhaustive analysis of winter
locational requirements, the results from this study suggest that some
reduction in the winter  requirement may be warranted and a
consideration of seasonal requirements should be incorporated in future ICAP
requirement studies.   NYPA believes that  having an ICAP requirement
for summer and winter seasons based on the LSE's peak load for the
respective season would send the proper ICAP price signal.


  NYPA is sharing the study results in the attached report in
an effort to begin a dialog which we hope will lead to a broader examination
of locational requirements when the issue is revisited again next year.  We
would appreciate hearing the views of other market participants.

NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Not to be argumentative, but we all pay for studies done by the ISO for
various purposes such as interconnect etc. The rules as I understand them is
that things get posted and provided to everyone at the same time for all of
these studies. If there is a policy or process that is outside of this
structure that's fine, but I would like to know about it, and ask the ISO to
explain how that works so others can avail themselves of the same
opportunities for ISO studies that can be provided on an "advance" basis.

In response to Roy's comments.  NYPA is paying for all the work conducted by
the ISO staff.  NYPA defined the study objective and all the ISO staff did
was conduct the MARS studies and document the results in the write-up we
provided to the tech exchange.

"Roy J. Shanker" <royjshanker@worldnet.att.net> writes to the
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

As a separate item to the concerns I had about the technical content, I was
a little confused on what was done here administratively. The last paragraph
says something about NYPA sharing the study. I didn't think they had
anything at all to say about it in the first place if it is an ISO work
product. If they do, could you explain why this is the case? If the ISO did
this, why wasn't this all posted on the OASIS at the same time NYPA got
this? The date on this shows a March 26 release.  Ignore these comments if
this was done, but I wasn't aware of this.

I am more than a little uncomfortable with a single market participant
having a month's lead time on ISO studies that can have significant
commercial impact. Think about the implications of this in the context of
people negotiating long term bi lateral ICAP agreements over the last month.
Depending on your take on the type of market changes that this type of
analysis might support, there could be enormous changes to the economics of
seasonal versus annual agreements, choice of equipment etc. This simply
isn't fair. Even if posted, this type of work by the ISO that can have large
potential commercial impacts should go out on all of the distributions at
the same time as release to anyone and OASIS posting.

Subject: NYPA study-Winter Locational ICAP requirements

At NYPA's request ISO staff conducted a limited analysis of
the winter locational ICAP requirements for Long Island and New York City
areas.  While such ICAP requirements have historically been set as a single
number for the entire year, it is NYPA's belief that this holdover from the
old way of doing business must be re-examined.  It is NYPA's belief that
most if not all of the contribution to loss of load risk occurs in the
summer months.  As such, some reduction in winter ICAP requirements should
be possible with no impact on the Loss of Load criterion of one day in ten
years.

NYPA requested that the ISO start with the database that
resulted in the locational requirements of 80% and 98% for New York City and
Long Island, respectively.   At NYPA's request the ISO modeled winter
ratings on the transmission interfaces into NYC and LI and determined how
much the 80% and 98% could be reduced in the winter before any impact on the
statewide Loss Of Load  occurred.  The report indicates that winter
requirements of 75% and 92% of the summer peak load resulted for NYC and LI,
respectively.

While this in no way reflects an exhaustive analysis of winter
locational requirements, the results from this study suggest that some
reduction in the winter         requirement may be warranted and a
consideration of seasonal requirements should be incorporated in future ICAP
requirement studies.   NYPA believes that       having an ICAP requirement
for summer and winter seasons based on the LSE's peak load for the
respective season would send the proper ICAP price signal.


NYPA is sharing the study results in the attached report in
an effort to begin a dialog which we hope will lead to a broader examination
of locational requirements when the issue is revisited again next year.  We
would appreciate hearing the views of other market participants.

Chad,

To answer your question - bid cost guarantees should be entered by you, Larry 
or Narsimha as soon as you calculate them.  I will watch them periodically 
throughout the month to be sure you are calculating them correctly.  Any time 
you have a question about what NY is showing just ask.

Here is the reconciliation for April to date.  Could you please take a look 
at your calculations for 4/5, 4/6, 4/10, 4/15 & 4/16 - the variances are 
quite large.
If you want details just ask. 

Thanks,

Rebecca

Dear Market Participants,

On November 15, 2000, the New York Independent System Operator,
Inc. filed a reformatted version of the NYISO Open Access Transmission
Tariff (OATT).  The new version is entitled New York Independent System
Operator, Inc.,  FERC Electric Tariff,  Original Volume No. 1.

This filing was made to comply with the FERC's Order No. 614, issued
March 31, 2000 in Docket No. RM99-12-000, 99 FERC   61,352 (2000).
Order 614 amended the FERC's regulations concerning the designation
of electric rate schedule sheets. This order changed the titles and
other administrative information to be shown at the top and bottom of
each tariff sheet, thus necessitating that the NYISO modify the information
included on the NYISO's tariff sheets.

The tariff filed on November 15, 2000 does not include any change in
the content of the tariff.  It does include the administrative changes
described above and a repagination and reformatting to facilitate
existing and future changes.  This tariff includes all tariff modifications
that were filed before September 1, 2000, and have been approved by the
FERC.  The tariff does not reflect filings made on or after September 1, 2000.
The tariff also does not reflect the NYISO's February 11, 2000 compliance
filing in Docket No. ER97-1523-029, which still awaits Commission action.

Once this tariff has been approved by the FERC, the NYISO will create and
post a consolidated version of the OATT that shows all approved and
proposed changes.  This new consolidated version will be comparable to
and replace the current consolidated OATT posted on the NYISO website.

The November 15, 2000 filing can be found on the NYISO website at:

Eric,
As we discussed, with ENSR's assistance I have developed a projected timeline 
for developing the FERC required F-1 Exhibit (12 part Resource Reports to 
satisfy the NEPA requirement) in sufficient detail to meet the FERC filing 
requirements and expedite the processing of the environmental portion of the 
application.  The aggressive timeline assumes that the expedited FERC 
"Collaborative Approach" will be implemented throughout the processing of the 
application.  Even with the "Collaborative Approach" and all of the upfront 
work done with the environmental community to streamline the processing, the 
schedule is very, very optimistic and assumes that all conflicting issues 
will be resolved quickly and the processing continue.  

I have requested that Jon Schmidt (ENSR) begin working on a detailed cost 
estimate, by quarters in two phases.  The first part of the estimate would be 
to project the environmental cost, by quarters of preparing the 12 Resource 
Reports (including the necessary field work) that would get Sun Devil to an 
FERC filing in the first quarter of 2002 that would not be rejected.  The 
second component of the cost estimate would be to complete the field work and 
permitting phases during the processing of the application.  This includes 
participating in FERC scoping meetings and agency meetings as required.  This 
would include assisting the third party environmental contractor in working 
on the EIS to expedite the writing as needed.  It would also include 
mitigation packages to satisfy agency requirements.  The third and final 
component would be to budget for a Third Party Environmental Contractor to 
write the EIS document during the time that the field work is being developed 
and to process the same with the FERC Staff.  Once we get the "White Paper" 
Fatal Flaw analysis that ENSR is preparing for this project we will have 
enough information along with the budget to get us to the FERC filing to make 
some quantifiable decisions on moving forward when comparing those to the 
commercial advantages that you are developing.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.  John Shafer

Attached below is the Excel-based VaR Calculator that allows VaR calculations 
for up to 5 different curves and/or products. The results may be different 
that those generated in the "official" VaR model, because it does not reflect 
all the intricacies. We have developed an Ad-hoc VaR model that allows quick 
calculations of VaR for a potential transaction, as well as the incremental 
VaR on a given portfolio (using the "official" VaR model). We will make this 
tool available to you via http://rac.enron.com/ in the near future (pending 
IT implementation).



TJ,

I do not have a list of names of all the traders on the desk (individuals who 
attended the VaR presentation). Could you please forward this e-mail to them.

Feel free to call me with any questions. Vlady.

Attached is another draft of the agenda for the meeting.  I added one item
of concern to PG&E having to do with the unfortunate financial problem of
your parent.

I have also attached in advance of the meeting the latest budget information
covering 2001.  I hope to send you the projected 2002 budget data on Monday.


It looks like we will have five attendees with only one able to play golf
(that being me).

We will see you on Tuesday evening at 7:00 pm in the lobby.  Hope everyone
will have a great Thanksgiving holiday.

John, I read Phil's statements concerning the Redrock air permit issue and 
would like to shed some additional light concerning the reason why  
Transwestern  did not know about the delay in the agencies issance of the air 
permits.  I had met with each agency prior to submitting each application to 
ensure that each application contained the correct and proper information 
required by the EPA and State of Arizona.  When I told them that we were 
expecting the permits by the end of September, each agency indicated that a 
September permit issuance would not be a problem, in light of the fact that 
energy issues were to be given top priority in the State of Califonia.   I 
phoned the  permit engineer assigned to each application monthly to be kept 
aware of possible conflicts and resolve any concerns.  In all monthly calls, 
both agencies assured me that things were progressing on schedule.  As we 
approached the anticipated September issuance, calls to the agencies were 
conducted weekly and this was when I found out about the 1-4 month additional 
time which would be required for the permit issuance.  I dont know what else 
could have been done to track and alleviate problems encountered to ensure 
that the permits would be issued in a timely manner.

Larry, as per our conversation, presented below are the emissions factors 
provided by the state of Colorado for the T-7000 Centaur under permit 
97LP0653 :

  PM10   14.000/MMSCF

  TSP   14.000/MMSCF

  NOx   0.100/MMBTU

  CO   0.121/MMBTU

  VOC   0.0348/MMBTU

  Formaldehyde  0.00438/MMBTU

  acetaldehyde  0.00546/MMBTU


As you already know, the emissions factors for the Centaur 50H turbine under 
permit 97LP0885 can be found on page 5 of this permit which was issued on 
October 6, 1999.

Remember, the state has given us until May 19 to have the rolling emissions 
calculations completed for both turbines at the facility.

Michael, I will be discussing with John and others in the near future about 
the status of the study.  When will your progress report be ready for 
review?  It might be a good idea to let us review your report and then we can 
make comments and recommendations based upon your findings.  Im glad that 
things are going well with your data and that we may be able to apply 
something positive towards our situation.  Thanks for getting back with me.

Subject: RE: status, PCB pipeline modeling study


Hi Larry:
 Sorry for the delayed response. I have just got back from an
overseas trip yesterday. I am in the process of preparing a progress report
for you. We have obtained some additional interesting results. I was also
waiting for input from your group. You may recall that at the end of our
Houston meeting, John told me that he would be getting back to me on some
specific directions from the group. I believe that we would be done with the
major aspects of PCB work soon, then we would be focusing on arsenic. Please
let me know of any thoughts and ideas. Thanks Larry.
  We are finally seeing the Spring here and maybe a short one for that
matter. Summer is just around the corner.
Best Regards,
Michael

Michael, I know its been some time since we communicated, but how is the
PCB pipeline modeling efforts going?   I would appreciate a  summary from
you identifying  recent discoveries and a general update on the project.

Have you thawed out from the Pennsylvania winter?

TOPAZ: NOVEMBER'S BIRTHSTONE
=============================
True topaz, symbol of love an affection, aid to sweetness of
disposition, and birthstone of November, is one of nature's
most wonderful and least-known gemstone families.  The true
topaz is rarely seen in jewelry stores.  Unfortunately, most
people know only the quartz (citrine) topaz.  In the past,
almost any yellow stone was called topaz.

Topaz occurs not only in the transparent yellow, yellow brown,
orangy brown, and pinky brown colors most popularly associated
with it, but also in light to medium red, light to medium
blue, very light green, violet and colorless.

Blue topaz has become very popular in recent years, although
most of it is treated and there is no way to determine which
is treated and which is natural.  Some of the deeper blue
treated topazes have been found to be radioactive and possibly
a health hazard.  In the United States, all blue topaz must be
tested for radiation levels.  However, be very careful when
buying blue topaz outside the United States, since it probably
has not been tested.


GIRDLE
===============
The girdle is the diamond's setting edge.  It needs to be just
thick enough to let the stone be set securely.  If it is too
thin, it is vulnerable to chipping;  too thick, and it can be
unattractive and difficult to set.  A thick girdle often creates
large, fuzzy gray reflections in the stone, especially if, as is
often the case, it accumulates dirt and grime.

On a step cut like an emerald, the girdle should be uniform in
thickness around the stone.  On a round, oval or cushion-shape
brilliant, it should undulate slightly between pairs of mains
and girdle facets and be thicker between the points of opposing
mains.  The girdle of a marquise, pear or heart is often slightly
thicker at the points to reduce the possibility of chipping.
Hearts have thicker girdles in their clefts.  Although slight
variations in girdle thickness are usually disregarded, sizable
variations can pose setting problems.

DIAMONDS AND GREASE
===================
If you wear a diamond, you probably have been surprised how
quickly a dirty film collects on the surface.  This is due
in large part to the fact that diamonds adhere to grease.  Put
your hands in dishwater and the grease quickly coats your
diamond.  The same thing happens with hand cream, body oils
and any other form of grease.

The fact that diamonds adhere to grease led to the invention of
the grease table in the late 1800s to separate diamonds for the
ore they are mined in.  The concentrate recovered from the
washing pans, pulsators, or heavy media separators is washed
over tables coated with thick grease.  The diamonds will adhere
to the table and then the resulting mixture is periodically
scraped off and melted down to remove the diamonds.

Today, the grease belt is more common.  Grease is automatically
applied at one end of a conveyor belt, the concentrates are
washed across it, and the resulting diamond-studded grease is
scraped off at the other end.

The amount of blueground (diamond ore)which has to be processed
is enormous.  Although figures differ for each mine, it takes
about 250 tons of blueground to produce a single one-carat
polished stone.


NATURAL
===========
A natural may not be a fault.  It's actually a piece of the
natural surface of the diamond crystal.  In cutting, a cutter
may decide to leave part of the "natural" rough surface in
order to get as large a diamond as possible from the rough
stone.  If this natural is no thicker than the thickness of the
girdle and does not distort the circumference of the stone,
most dealers consider it a minor defect at worst; if it extends
into the crown or pavilion of the stone, it is a serious fault.

Sometimes, if the natural is somewhat large but slightly below
the girdle, it will be polished off.  This produces an extra
facet.


FAMOUS DIAMONDS
===============
Name:  The Lesotho
Weight: 601.25 carats (rough)
Color: Brown

Lesotho is an isolated, landlocked mountain kingdom, poor
in natural resources and entirely surrounded by South
Africa. Lesotho was considered too remote to allow
profitable diamond mining.  In 1960, when the government
opened 30-square-foot claims, there was no shortage of
local prospectors seeking a big strike.  On May 26, 1967
Ernestine Ramaboa, working the claim she shared with her
husband Petrus, discovered a brown diamond of extraordinary
size.  The diamond, weighing 601.25 carats, caused a
sensation.  Eventually sold to Harry Winston who had the
diamond flown to New York and invited the Ramaboas as
his guests.

On March 5, 1968, on live TV, the stone was cleaved at
the precise point where nature left a crack in the
surface.  It was eventually cut into 18 polished stones
totaling 242.50 carats, the largest a 71.73 carat
emerald cut.

THE GREAT DIAMOND HUNT
=========================
Diamonds have been found in India for at least 3000 years.
For centuries, in fact, India was the world's only major
source, although there is no record of systematic mining
before about 1000 AD.  The Indian mines are no longer
significant producers.  Through the ages, however, new
sources are constantly discovered as older ones are depleted.

In the 1970s, gold miners in Brazil began finding shiny
pebbles which they tended to keep because they were beautiful.
Most had no idea of what they were worth, and better-informed
prospectors bought them for pocket change.

Over a hundred years later, diamonds were discovered in South
Africa, where the first alluvial (water carried)finds let
prospectors to the kimberlite pipes which had originally
brought these treasures to the surface.  This in tern led to
greater understanding of the geology of diamonds, and
transformed prospecting from a haphazard venture into a
scientific enterprise.

Today, diamonds have been found on every continent, although
not everywhere in commercially viable quantities and
qualities.  It is becoming clear that diamonds are much more
widely distributed over the entire globe than people once
thought.  Prospecting technology is also increasingly
sophisticated-the independent prospector with his shovel and
pan is being replaced by electromagnetic mapping techniques
and helicopter-mounted infrared cameras.

As a result, three out of five of today's major sources have
been discovered in the last quarter-century.  There is no
likelihood of running out of gem quality diamonds in the
foreseeable future.


ROUNDNESS
=============
A round diamond is not perfectly round and its roundness will
affect value.  The measurements of a round diamond include the
highest diameter, the lowest diameter and the depth.
Recognizing the rarity of truly round diamonds, some deviation
is permitted, and the stone will not be considered "out-of-
round" unless it deviates by more than the established norm-
approximately 0.10 millimeter (one-tenth of a millimeter) in
a one-carat stone.  In other words, the difference between the
two diameters should be less than 0.10 millimeters for a one
carat diamond, 0.12 millimeters for a two carat and 0.14
millimeters for a three carat.


AGS INTRODUCES LASER INSCRIPTIONS
=================================
The American Gem Society lab is now offering a laser
inscription service-similar to that offered by many of its
competitors-that "writes" on a stone's girdle.  The new
system an inscribe any type of gemstone, including colored
gemstones and can be used to inscribe words and/or logos,
and is experimenting with bar codes.

The AGS has become the premier grading laboratory for round
exceptionally well-cut diamonds.  When wholesalers buy stones
that have great cut they send them to the AGS for grading
even if they have been previously graded at another lab.  The
wholesalers hope to attain the AGS Ideal cut grade which means
the diamonds has Ideal polish, Ideal symmetry and Ideal
proportions.  These AGS Ideal cut diamonds are priced at a
premium but are in high demand by customers who want the best
of the best.


DIAMOND AND JEWELRY BOOKS

fine jewelry is to read one or more of the great books

FYI....I received the encroachment permit yesterday and have requested the
insurance certificate accordingly.  There are alot of requirements in this
item and may take us getting waivers or ammendments from the carrier.   I
will keep you informed on the timing.  This will probably not be a quick
turn around like a vanilla certificate.

That's great Larry. I understand that we can not do anything in the by-pass
channel and this will be made clear in the environmental orientation
Monday. If we don't get compensation credits, insurance certificates and
written approval from the Fish and Game for trapping we can not proceed any
father than the carrot field. Once we get the approvals the plan is to
clear right of way and string pipe week ahead. The by-pass channel is a
month into the project.

Kenny, I have contacted the agencies for which permits and approvals were
requested and have been given the green light to initiate the Rogas
project.  Please understand that IN NO WAY can we initiate activities
associated with the bypass channel construction until approval is given by
each agency contacted.  I will apprise you as the approvals are received or
if further information is requested by each agency.  Enjoy digging in the
carrot field.

Subject:  Re: Rogas Pipelines



Kenny, as you may know, there were 9 environmental applications submitted
to various local, state, and regional agencies requesting approval to
initiate this project and most of the requests apply to crossing the bypass
channel.   As of today, we have received one approval, and that from the
State Fire Marshall, Office of Pipeline Safety granting us a waiver so that
we can lay the pipe above ground as opposed to below ground.  I have calls
into  the other agencies  for which applications and requests were
submitted but have had no reply.  I would caution that we might get into
trouble for initiating a construction project without consent and approval
from a particular agency, as agencies many times look at an entire project
even though their jurisdiction may only apply in one specific area of a
project.  This is particularily the case in air permitting where an
applicant can not even construct a road or bring in construction materials
until the air permit is issued.  Because this is my first project in
California, Id like to be sure of this and make follow up calls to all
agencies for which applications and requests were submitted and verify that
we can initiate the construction, as long as we dont impact a specific  or
strategic portion (ie  the bypass channel)  for sometime down the road when
we are well into the project.   Ill call you tomorrow and let you
know.......

Subject:  Rogas Pipelines


We are going to start the Rogas project Monday 03/12/2001. The first 2500
ft leaving Rogas is across a carrot field that has been harvested and is
not in any habitat. The farmer is due to start working the field the 24th
so we need to get the pipe laid. The contractor is going to start with a
reduced crew and expects to be finished crossing the initial 2500 ft by the
end of the week. The following things must be accomplished early next week
so we can continue construction.

Checks received so we can purchase compensation credits from Kern Water
Bank and Area.

Be added to the KWB's Master Permit. That will happen when they receive
there check.

Insurance certificates in the hands of the Kern County Water Agency and
West Kern Water.

If the contractor has to stop we may be faced with additional mobilization
and demobilization charges.

Message sent from the pjm-customer-info mailing list at
pjm-customer-info@majordomo.pjm.com:

On June 12, PJM will implement the Collaborative Scheduling System (CSS), a 
new
scheduling tool designed to facilitate transaction schedules between New York
and PJM.
CSS will become part of the EES tool now used to schedule transactions from 
and
to PJM neighbors.

PJM will offer several two-hour "virtual" workshops to introduce the new 
system.
Participants who now use EES and will use CSS are encouraged to attend one of
these workshops.  The dates for the workshops are: May 31 at 10:00 a.m., June 
5
at 2:00 p.m. or June 11 at 2:00 p.m. The workshops will be presented on the
internet with audio teleconference.

A complete description of the new tool, the training program, and a 
registration

Today I spoke with Jean Calhoun of the Arizona Chapter of The Nature 
Conservancy about the proposed Sundevil Pipeline Construction Project. She 
was very cordial and appreciative concerning Transwestern's proactive efforts 
to contact not only her office but all federal and state agencies  which may 
have jurisdictional lands impacted by the project.  Although the proposed 
route of the pipeline corridor has not been firmly established, she did  
offer some general, yet valuable information concerning the geographic area 
which exists south of Flagstaff into roughly northern Phoenix.  

The area south of Flagstaff into Phoenix crosses of three major ecological 
regions identified by the TNC with major biological diversity of plants and 
animals.  The TNC has completed published studies on two of the regions.  The 
TNC has requested that should this project be apporved, these publications be 
used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed 
prior to construction and approval by FERC.  To the south and east of 
Flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the Verde River which is of 
ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species 
which live in and around the area of the River.   This river could be 
impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction 
across Arizona.  

I have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies, in addition 
to the TNC, and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the 
environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the 
pipeline corridor route.  Part of this concern is due to the extensive and 
unique biological diversity of Arizona.  I think we will have a better handle 
on how we address the environmental concerns and opportunities when this 
piece of the puzzle is completed and also how much more specific and helpful 
the agencies assistance will be when identified areas are known.

Team,

Here are the meeting minutes as I captured them from the Gas Injection
portion of our meeting on Tuesday.  Please take some time to review and let
me know if I missed anything or made any mistakes in my note taking.  I
look forward to working with everyone to see if we can make this happen.

Aaron Breidenbaugh <aaron@global2000.net> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE 
Discussion List:

Sorry about that.

Those who know me, know that the missing zero in my previous email was
probably a Freudian "wishful thinking" slip. FERC of course approved the
continuation of the existing $1000 (not $100) bid cap.

A question for the ISO and Penalty/Disclosure proponents: given the
close linkage between the AMP and the Penalties proposal now being
appealed to the Board, is the MC going to have to revisit the Penalties
motion as well? If so, will the two proposals stay separate or go up to
the MC and Board as a package?

Aaron

In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the 
Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of 
MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and 
outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each 
message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and 
inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following 
attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, 
*.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these 
e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how 
to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful 
e-mail viruses. We believe that these protections will result in less down 
time for your e-mail, in the event that Enron gets hit with a virus or 
malicious code.

It is amazing and yet not surprising how much Enron has accomplished in the=
=20
first six months of this year. You continue to make it happen.  We recogniz=
e=20
that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron=01,s business goals, and w=
e are=20
pleased that many of you have shared in the company=01,s financial success=
=20
through Enron stock options.=20

As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as t=
he=20
All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided valu=
e=20
to participants through 2000.  Employees who have participated in this=20
program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of=
=20
their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the=20
program.  =20

Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package=
=20
and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron=01,s continued=
=20
success.  Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and=
=20
Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decid=
ed=20
to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.

On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for=
=20
calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program).  =
It is=20
expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be granted,=
=20
effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligib=
le=20
on that date (please see note below).  The new program, which is subject to=
=20
final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, is as follows:

? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to=20
eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and=20
international companies/locations.
? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base=20
salary (5% of annual base salary for each year of a 5-year period) on=20
December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some=20
international locations.)
? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000.
? Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated gran=
t=20
of stock options.

Why commit your talent and energy to Enron?  EnronOptions =01) Your Stock O=
ption=20
Program, among other good reasons=01( that=01,s why.

In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =
=01)=20
Your Stock Option Program.  To provide information and answer your question=
s,=20
we will introduce a special link on the Human Resources web-site, host=20
several eSpeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular=
=20
basis.  In the meantime, if you have immediate questions, please contact yo=
ur=20
Human Resources representative.=20

Note: In addition to final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, grant=
ing=20
of options will be subject to New York Stock Exchange and state and federal=
=20
regulatory requirements.  It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock=

Option Program will be available to most Enron employees; however, some Enr=
on=20
companies=01, employees may not be eligible due to legal, accounting, tax, =
labor=20
or business issues.  As you know, Enron changes to meet the needs of the=20

ne=20
the eligibility for EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program and will=20
communicate more details throughout the year with final eligibility being=

determined on December 29, 2000.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165.

John, I just spoke with Dan Walker, Vice President  of Development for the 
Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation about Enron's initiative for a corporation 
partnership.  After we had discussed our interest and desire and what 
opportunities are available with the Foundation for Enron, Dan stated that 
will be visiting with the Foundation's CEO next week and one of the issues to 
be discussed will be development of  an MOU or Agreement between Enron and 
the RMEF.  Looks like things are beginning to progress.

Im having quite a bit of interest from some of the Houston based Enron 
employees about how they can get involved.  Any suggestions on how I can 
"advertise" opportunities within the Corporation for employee involvement 
with the RMEF?

EPA released their urban strategy for their Air Toxics Program, and they 
listed reciprocating engines as an area source they plan on regulated under 
the MACT regulations for formaldehyde. As you know, an area source is a 
location that emits less than 10 tons of any one Hazardous Air Pollutant 
(HAP) or 25 tons/year of all HAPs. This was a big surprise to industry. 

As expected they also listed oil and gas production as an area source they 
plan on regulating, but did not list transmission and storage dehydration, or 
turbines. They will regulate major sources for HAPs in all of these 
categories.

Subject: FERC Staff Investigations on Midwest and Southeast Bulk Power Systems


On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power 
Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a 
Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff 
(Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of 
information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed 
many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller 
(who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no 
obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically 
looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, 
Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the 
Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement 
for several years:

Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by 
requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other 
transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to 
favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of 
interconnection requests.

While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff 
to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of 
complaints.

The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro 
forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply 
relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and 
procedures.

Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions 
pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports 
and exports.

RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well 
as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such 
standardized criteria might not "get to the root of the problem" -- that 
control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that 
each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area.  
Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could 
standardize ATC and TTC methodology.

Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics 
similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as "different," with a 
reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the 
regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a 
traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the 
commodity and services.  

DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, 
transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):

Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission 
Providers ("TPs") that control transmission, generation and load.  "As such, 
they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service 
to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services."  Staff 
received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information 
available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated 
incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack 
of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants 
to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market.  

TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an 
"enormous" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 
1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes.  
Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with 
virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were 
highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and 
another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even 
though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 
78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The 
total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are 
not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose 
procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission 
has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open 
Access Transmission Tariffs ("OATT") where the Commission has the power to 
enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission 
has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, 
including the propriety of TLRs.

TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market 
because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an 
inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In 
addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased 
loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one 
control area per RTO.

Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for 
price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe 
that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction 
increased in the Midwest.  

Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information 
in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for 
service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission 
access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and 
protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and 
discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, 
such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs 
were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market 
inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully 
analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, 
eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that 
because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed 
incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the 
IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, "Transmission Markets, Stretching 
the Rules for Fun and Profit.")

Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, 
particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided 
to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper 
implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.

The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all 
three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and 
native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO 
exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security 
coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region 
of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The 
result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.  
Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit 
this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is 
weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of 
liquidity.

Staff next noted the problems with unfiled "business practices," especially 
on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas 
of non-compliance.  

Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, 
with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow 
input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information 
transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under 
RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  "As a 
consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption 
and have all transactions under the same tariff."  ***  The Commission could 
benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the 
TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.

Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, 
Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits 
or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have 
the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have 
against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide 
variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the 
region.

Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the 
Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on "passively" 
receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory 
behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.  
While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread, 
there is evidence of discriminatory instances.


Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility ("VIU") model has 
largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the 
economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs 
have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due 
to the inherent flexibility of the current rules.

Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies, 
transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and 
manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the 
transmission system and use many TLRs.

There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development 
of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and 
there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.

TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted 
as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the 
SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have 
reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to 
perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform 
interconnection studies.

In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant 
plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.

Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this 
summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than 
the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were 
radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better 
prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased 
generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages.  

SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to 
extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)

The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to 
discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE 
(including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence 
in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be 
justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence 
discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes 
that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how 
transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns 
that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigation 
found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In 
addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff 
thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted.  
Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of 
jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access 
information.

The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack 
of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In 
addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission 
capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to 
interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied 
Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the 
construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.  
Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting 
self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.

ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a 
standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without 
direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communication 
are needed.

The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase raises 
the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive 
operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by 
Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC 
criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do 
not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs 
must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  In 
addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.  
However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.

*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated 
weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the 
formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie, 
treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same 
tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision 
of transparent and standardized information.

Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a 
"problem area" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission 
bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law 
and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of 
deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong 
incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In 
addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists 
a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the 
tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park 
power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the 
development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.

A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including 
confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange 
information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to 
FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an 
established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not 
displayed in error.  It is "up to individual Managers discretion."  ((FRCC 
web site report dated 9/8/00)).  Violations such as these undermine 
competition.

Purpose: 
We have found that IP multicast storms on the EOL internal subnet 172.16.21.0 
briefly incapacitate the EOL firewall eolfw1.  To solve the problem, we will 
insert a new VLAN/subnet 172.16.23.0 between 172.16.21.0 and the firewall so 
that no IP multicast traffic will reach the firewall interface.  Physical 
work includes running two copper cables from trd-cx[12]-3405 port 6/7 to 
eolfw1 and logical work entails defining the new VLAN on the 
switches/routers, enabling interface vlan23 and changing

ip route 192.216.56.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.21.4

I wanted to present this summary of the meeting Transwestern had with 
representatives of the Laguna Pueblo concerning the status of the PCB 
remediation activities by TW.  On the Laguna side were members of the Laguna 
pueblo, the PEOP a  technical oversight group that provides expertise and 
assistance on technical issues for all of the 19 pueblos in New Mexico 
(ranging from UST to superfund), and members of ETS ( 5 members of the Laguna 
team, Butch Russell, Rick Smith  (advisor for the Laguna team), myself)  and 
George Robinson.   This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a 
half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest 
in environmental activities on their pueblo.

The meeting centered around two issues at the site: the closure of the UST 
and the PCB remediation activity.  With respect to the first, concensus was 
reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples 
at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis, 
and send the results to POEP for review. 

With repsect to the PCB remediation issue, things were a little different.  
The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal 
Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is 
presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals 
toward  achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the 
Lagunas have verified this.  They indicated that that have been patient with 
Transwstern's attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB 
contamination, but based upon the historic sampling results, that this 
technology is not proving to be very successful, in fact the results have 
shown stagnant results  (Im using their words).  They would like to see 
Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup 
and closure of this site.   Members of the Laguna pueblo, who work for the 
POEP,  expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact 
future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of 
Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their 
lands.   One member of the Laguna pueblo called the contamination a "cancer"  
with potential to spread.   A comment was made by the POEP that there was a 
major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination 
if we continue to just maintain  our present approach of just monitoring the 
site and installing additional wells..

A member of the POEP has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from 
North Dakota State University, (Energy and Environmental Research Center) who 
claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered 
difficult to remediate (this site would certainly fall into this category due 
to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and 
channels present which direct  the PCB containing liquids present at the 
site).  Although the POEP was not recommending Transwestern utilize their 
service, they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site 
with them.

It shold also be mentioned that Syed Risvi, the POEP Superfund representative 
was at this meeting.  He had mentioned that the  POEP has been in discussions 
with EPA Region VI concerning potential classification of the site on the 
CERCLIS list of sites for inclusion on the NPL..  He had indicated that he 
did not want to see this site included on the list, but stated that 
Transwetern needed to update and show postive results in our remediation 
efforts and that it was the tribal councils opinion that this was not being 
done.

At the conclusion of the meeting, I informed the POEP that Transwestern's 
internal remediation group  would contact the NDSU group and discuss the site 
characteristics with them and we would reprot back to them the results of our 
discussions.  This seemed to satisify the  POEP and they were content with 
this. 

John, I would like to schedule a conference call with the above list of 
people and discuss this issue.  A couple of things I want to bring out.  
First, we will be undergoing ROW and Compressor Station renewals with the 
Lagunas in the near future.  Second, on the Laguna tribal lands, they have 
experienced other releases of contimation and are currently very sensitive to 
this whole  contamination problem.  Although we are considered by the POEP as 
proactive up to this point  and very easy to work with (direct quote from the 
POEP)   they are wanting a more proactive and measurable effort from 
Transwestern to clean up the PCBs. 
Please get back with me on this.

Mr. Campbell,

49 CFR 195 addresses regulations for the transportation of hazardous liquids
by pipelines.  Attached are some of the regs that specify applicability,
defnitions, and tank inspection requirements.  I don't see any exemptions
from the inspection requirements for breakout tanks.  Let me know if you
need more in-depth analysis of the DOT regs.

Soil sampling for waste characterization was completed on September 6th. Bill 
Olson with the NMOCD was on-site to observe the sampling activities. 
Twenty-two soil samples were collected from the two former pit areas. Lab 
results indicate that the impacted soil samples do not trigger RCRA hazardous 
waste criteria, more specifically:
? for all 22 samples, all TCLP VOC constituents were non-detect
? for all 22 samples, all TCLP SVOC constituents were non-detect
? for all 22 samples, all TCLP Metal constituents were non-detect with only 
two exceptions. Arsenic was detected in the TCLP extract for two samples; one 
at 1.41 mg/L and another at 2.18 mg/L, both below the RCRA regulatory limit 
of 5.0 mg/L.
? for all 22 samples, the samples were determined to be "not-ignitable"
? for all 22 samples, reactive cyanide and reactive sulfide were non-detect 
with only one exception. Reactive sulfide was detected for one sample at 160 
mg/kg; this is below the guidance level of 500 mg/kg.
? the measured pH for all samples was in the range of 6.9 - 9.1; this is 
within the RCRA regulatory limits of 2.0 - 12.5.

Furthermore, the measured TPH for all samples was in the range of 131 - 9660 
mg/kg with an average TPH concentration of 2429 mg/kg.

Selected photos of the sampling effort are attached. There was a considerable 
amount of waste debris found in the pits, particulary at the east end of the 
larger pit area.

I will be finalizing the excavation plan for the former pit areas over the 
next week or so. I will prepare cost estimates for two alternative excavation 
plans; one for a dig and haul option and one for a combination of dig and 
haul for the most heavily affected soil and on-site blending for less 
affected soil. We should try to have a work plan to the NMOCD by the week of 
October 1st.

I received a call from the consultant who performed the archeology survey at 
stations 1 and 2.  Based upon the plot plan provided by construction, the 
archeology discovery at station 1 does not occur within the area of proposed 
impact, even though  part of the discovery is within the facility fence.  The 
report  recommendation to the SHPO by the archeologist will be that during 
construction activities in this area, an archeologist be onsite to monitor 
and ensure that the site is not impacted.  They will also recommend that we 
fence the discovery area within our facility to ensure that future pipeline 
activities will not disrupt the site.  

I have asked that two reports be prepared for each site.  One report for each 
station covering the construction areas and the other reports to include the 
entire 40 acres at each compressor station.  All four reports will be 
submitted to Bret Fritch in Omaha on Monday, the 26th of March.

EMERALD: MAY BIRTHSTONE
==============================
Emerald is a green variety of the mineral beryl.  One of the
rarest members of the beryl family-only the red variety
(sometimes called "red emerald") is rarer-it is one of the most
highly prized of all the gems.  Aside from being the birthstone
for May, it was historically believed to bestow on its wearer
faithfulness and unchanging love, and was thought to enable
the wearer to forecast events.

The highest-quality emerald has the color of fresh young green
grass-an almost pure spectral green, possibly with a very faint
tint of blue, as in the finest emerald from Columbia, which is
considered by connoisseurs to be the world's finest.  Other
sources include Brazil, Zambia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Russia
and India.  Flawless emeralds are rare, so their "flaws" have
come to serve almost as "fingerprints," while flawless
emeralds are immediately suspect.  Although a hard stone,
emerald will chip easily since it tends to be somewhat brittle,
so special care should be given in wearing and handling.

Techniques to enhance color and reduce the visibility of flaws
are also frequently used.  A common practice is to fill
surface-reaching cracks with oil (sometimes tinted green), a
practice that goes back to early Greek times.  Today's
emeralds are oiled using a vacuum/heat technology.  This is a
widely accepted trade practice, since it is actually good for
the stone in light of its fragile nature.  Oiling hides some
of the whitish flaws, which are actually cracks, filling the
cracks so they become less visible.  The oil becomes an
integral part of the emerald unless it is subjected to some
type of degreasing procedure.  The development and use of
the ultrasonic cleaner has brought to light the extensive-
ness of this practice.  Never clean emeralds in an
ultrasonic cleaner.

While oiling is considered an acceptable practice, be sure
the price reflects the actual quality of the stone.  If
necessary, most emeralds can be "re-oiled."


FAMOUS DIAMONDS
=========================

Name:   Uncle Sam
Weight: 40.23 carats (rough) and 12.42 carats (cut)
Color:  M (very light brown)
Clarity:VVS1
Shape: Emerald Cut

The Uncle Sam diamond, which was discovered in the "Crater
of diamonds" in Arkansas in 1924, is the largest yet found
in the United States.  Peiken Jewelers of New York City,
owned the Uncle Sam for many years.  For a while, it was
on loan to the American Museum of Natural History.  In
1971, Sidney de Young, a dealer from Boston, bought the
diamond and then sold it to an unnamed collector.


SEA DIAMONDS
===========================================
An enterprising Texan called Sammy Collins drew worldwide
attention in 1962 when he announced that he'd recovered
50,000 carats of diamonds worth $1.5 million from the
seabed off the treacherous Diamond Coast of South West
Africa.  Collins figured that since diamonds had been
found in abundant amounts along the coast, most likely
carried there by the Vaal and Orange rivers from some
far inland deposit, they also ought to be found under
the ocean.

Over a period of three years, Collins used the equivalent
of huge vacuum sweepers to suck some 400,000 carats of
diamonds from the seabed.  His adventures set off a
mini-rush by others to try this new type of exploration
but terrible working conditions and uncertain diamond
deposits sent most into early obscurity.

Today, with improved technology, De Beers and others are
once again probing the waters of the South Atlantic,
bringing closer the prospect of viable undersea
diamond recovery.


LOOKING FOR SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL?
============================================
We will be attending the annual JCK Jewelry Show in Las Vegas
the first week of June.  This is your opportunity to get access
to wonderful designer jewelry at a fraction of regular retail
prices.  With almost 3,000 booths of diamonds and jewelry from
all over the world, this trade show brings the most beautiful
jewelry in the world to one place.

If you have special piece of jewelry you've always wanted but
didn't think you could afford, give us a call so we can find
it for you.  The same goes for color gem stones since we can
hand pick from the most beautiful colored stones in the world
for your special ring, pendant or bracelet.

While the Diamond Source of Virginia does not have an inventory
of diamonds or jewelry, we have accounts with the leading
wholesalers and designers across the country and can special
order your custom jewelry or pick it out in person at this show.
We go with our shopping list for our customers and return with
the best of the best.  If you have a special request, please
give Anne a call at 888-477-8385 and tell us what you want.


SI2 CLARITY
=========================
While we recommend at least SI1 clarity for most
diamonds to ensure they are "eye clean," many consumers
think that SI2 means nothing visible with the naked eye.
The following comments define the official GIA position:

"SI stones contain noticeable inclusions which are easy
(SI1) or very easy (SI2) for a trained grader to see
under 10X. Typical inclusions are included crystals,
clouds, and feathers, normally centrally located and
noticed immediately. A stone with an eye visible
inclusion can still be graded SI. You must consider the
size, nature, position, number, and color or relief of
the inclusion. The size and shape of the stone are
important too. Characteristics in the SI1 grade usually
are not visible to the unaided eye face-up.
Characteristics in some SI2 stones can be seen with the
unaided eye."

We find that over half of the SI2 stones have visible
inclusions to the naked eye. Note the above comments
say "visible to the unaided eye face-up." With most
shapes of diamonds, inclusions are often easily visible
from the side where there are few, if any, facets to
hide them. We just sent a VS1 clarity princess back to
the wholesaler because the inclusion, while not visible
face-up, was easily visible with the naked eye from the
side. You can imagine what the SI2 diamonds look like
from the side if they are visible face-up. If the
mounting hides the side of the diamond, these side
visible inclusions are not a problem. But most mountings
show off the side of a diamond and make them easy to see.

INSURANCE QUESTIONS
==============================
Most people do not realize that insurers differ widely in
what they offer regarding coverage and reimbursement or
replacement.  Many insurance companies will not reimburse
the "full value" provided in the policy but, rather,
exercise a "replacement" option--and will offer a sum in
cash less than the amount for which the jewelry is
insured, or offer to replace it for you.  Therefore it is
important to ask some very specific questions to determine
the precise coverage offered.  We recommend asking the
insurer at least the following:

1) How do you satisfy claims?  Do you reimburse the insured
amount in cash?  If not, how is the amount of the cash
settlement determined?  Or do you replace the jewelry?

2) What involvements do I have in the replacement of an
item?  What assurance do I have that the replacement will be
of comparable quality and value?

3) What is your coverage on articles that cannot be
replaced?

4) Exactly what risks does my policy cover--all risks?
Mysterious disappearance?  Am I covered in all geographic
areas?  At all times?

5) Are their any exemptions or exclusions?  What if the loss
involves negligence?  What happens if the diamond falls out?

6) What are the deductibles, if any?

7) What documentation do you expect me to provide?

Every week we hear yet another story of a customer who paid
insurance premiums for years and were shocked to discover
how little protection they really had when they did have a
claim.  Check the small print before you need it.


FOUR C'S
===========================
Diamond quality and value are determined by four factors.
These factors are called the "Four C's."  If we were to rank
them based on their importance in determining the value of a
diamond, we would list them as follows:

1) Color
2) Clarity
3) Cut and proportion
4) Carat weight

In terms of determining beauty, however, we would rank them
in a different order:

1) Cut and proportion
2) Color
3) Clarity
4) Carat weight

When diamond shopping, it pays to put your focus on cut and
proportion since this is where you get the most impact on
beauty while paying little premium in price.  We recommend
investing your dollars in beauty you see rather than rarity
and higher "quality" not visible to your eye.

BOW TIE
=======
One of the most obvious indicators of poor proportioning
in fancy shaped diamonds is the bow tie, or butterfly effect,
a darkened area across the center or widest part of the
stone, depending upon the cut.  The bow tie is commonly
seen in the pear shape or marquise but may exist in any
fancy shape.  Virtually all fancy shapes cut today will
exhibit some minimal bow tie effect.  Nonetheless, the
presence or absence of a bow tie is an indicator of proper
proportioning.  In poorly proportioned stones there is a
pronounced bow tie; the more pronounced, the poorer the
proportioning.  The less pronounced the bow tie, the better
the proportioning.  The degree to which the bow tie is
evident is the first indicator of a good or poor make (cut).


PRICE CALCULATOR
================
Probably the most popular feature of our web site is the
diamond price calculator where shoppers can input a shape,
color grade, clarity grade, and carat weight to determine
an estimate of our price for that type of diamond.  If you
haven't tried it yet, check it out at:
http://www.dsourceva.com/cost.htm#calc


DIAMOND AND JEWELRY BOOKS
=========================
One of the best ways to be a better shopper for diamonds and
fine jewelry is to read one or more of the great books
listed at the following web page:

NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



Is evening load pick up a security issue or an economic issue?
Loading a Gilboa to peak shave is outside of the market rules. There are
other bids that should have been accepted prior to this control action.

27-Nov-2000 15:45:59 ISO REQUESTS GILBOA___4 OUT OF MERIT FOR ISO SECURITY.
EVENING LOAD PICK UP AT 16:00 11/27/00

If the NYISO is under generated due to load pick up why are GTs not
dispatched instead of loading generation out-of-merit.
If the NYISO is loading Gilboa to satisfy 10 min spinning reserve why are
not 10 min non-spin generators or 30 minute non-spin generators dispatched
prior to dispatching generation out-of-merit.
Both 10 minute and 30 minute non-spin generators if generated could be
generated displacing 10 spinning reserve negating the need to dispatch
Gilboa out-of-merit.
As always due to limited info available conclusions are drawn based on info
available. If more info is available please post it.

Thanks

Larry,
In the latest conversation with Harold Barth, a field engineer with Solar, we 
were told that the equipment data received last week was a best case 
scenario.  The fuel consumption rate was displayed in MMbtu/hr., and due to 
the heating value used, we should divide this number by .92 to get Scf/hr..  
When this is done, the rate that coincides with a 20 degree inlet temperature 
is 49.42 standard cubic feet per hour, which is slightly greater than what 
our permit says should be our maximum fuel consumption rate.  Harold also 
stated that achieving this rate on a daily basis is unrealistic, since these 
figures are based on new equipment in perfect condition.  Solar does not 
publish maximum fuel consumption figures, much like the auto manufacturers, 
since this is dependent upon site specific operating conditions.  He 
suggested that we add our 10% cushion factor to this data, and submit it to 
the State.  I'm sure that Harold would provide a written statement regarding 
the status of our equipment,  that could be used as documentation for the 
state, if you deem it necessary.  Let me know what you think!  Rich has 
suggested that we have a conference call to discuss possible solutions to the 
problem, so let me know.

        Thanks,
        Larry Harrell

Hi Larry,

Since it's been a month since we emailed you our list of recommendations, we 
wanted to check back with you and see if there is anything we can do to help 
you with your diamond buying decision? Our goal is to help you make an 
informed decision that you will be happy with for years to come.  Remember, 
since we don't own these stones, we are your personal diamonds consultants 
who will work to find the very best diamond for you at a great price.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST since we are dealing with customers and 
suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always want 
to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and 
answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

P.S.
If you have already purchased, please let us know in a reply to this message 
so we will know not to send any more follow up messages.

While it would benefit the organization for me to go on this trip,  I don't 
think it is wise to participate given the current project load.

Sarita, were all set for rooms and meals.  The itinerary is as follows.  
John, Bill and Randy will fly into Flagstaff, sometime in the PM of Monday, 
June 18th.  Rich, Tiny and or  I will either pick them up at the airport or 
there is shuttle service to Little America, the hotel in Flagstaff for the 2 
night stay.  We plan on visiting stations 3 and 4 on Tuesday.  Then 1 and 2 
on Wednesday.  I dont think that we will need rental cars as Rich, Tiny and I 
will have our company cars.  John had indicated that he needed to make a 
Thursday meeting in Houston, so I only made reservations at Little America 
for Monday and Tuesday night.  Should Randy and or Bill decide to stay over 
on Thursday, we can make reservations for Wednesday also.  Let me know.   I m 
not sure what Louie is doing, he had stated that he would take care of his 
accomodations should he decide to make the trip.   Ive  got business at 
Stations 1 and 2 on Thursday and Friday, so Ill be there the whole week.  As 
for Tiny, Im sure he will be carrying Rich's luggage any where Rich needs to 
go...... Sarita, what else?

Hey guys,

I've updated the transmission rates table for May - here is the location:

M:\Electric\East Volume Mgmt\Transmission\Transmission Rates

If there is a better spot for this to make it more accessible just let me 
know and I can put a copy of it whereever.

Couple of other trends I've noticed that hopefully can be corrected...

First Energy transmission is now and has been for a while under the 
counterparty American Transmission Systems, Inc. (ATSI)
Duke transmission should be under the Duke counterparty Duke Electric 
Transmission (DUKEELETRA)
Georgia's ancillary service charges have changed although their website has 
not be updated - price changed from $2.57 to $2.49

Please pass this along to the rest of the group, if any of you have any 
questions or suggestions - don't hesitate to call.

Thanks,
Michael

Kermit Team, I received a letter from the TNRCC concerning emissions fees 
that have not been paid for a facility called the "Hendrick/Wink Tank Farm".  
The letter was addressed to a Mr. Paul Newman of EOTT.  The letter stated 
that we may owe emissions fees for the facility.  My question is, do you have 
such a facility in your team area, and what does it comprise?  ie..number and 
size of tanks, throughput in 2000.  The TNRCC letter was dated March 28, 2001 
and we are required  to provide information to them within 30 days.  I just 
received the letter today.  HELP!!  I need something from you by this 
afternoon or tomorrow at the latest.

The pig that was run to PG&E on Monday came in dry with no liquids.  As you 
will notice there are a few new sample points with liquids that were 
accumilated.

For those who have never traveled to the great West, cattle guards are
horizontal steel rails placed on the road at fence openings to prevent
  cattle from crossing.  For some reason the bovines will not step on the
guards, probably because they fear getting their feet caught between the
rails. I need to make that clear in order for you to appreciate the
following true story:

President Clinton received a report that there were over 100,000 cattle
  guards in Colorado.  Because Colorado ranchers protested his proposed
  changes in grazing policies, he ordered Secretary of Interior Bruce
  Babbitt to fire half of the guards immediately. Before Babbitt could
respond, and presumably straighten him out, Colorado's congresswoman
Pat Schroeder intervened with a request that before any were fired, they
be given six months of retraining.

  Al Gore, never one to pass up a chance to piggy back on any story,
pointed out that if the Guards had formed a strong union, such as the
teachers have with the NEA, they would not be in jeopardy.

  ....And so it goes, in this election year.  Don't you just love the
smell of political napalm in the morning?  We are governed by a pack of
fools!






What is a Goron?


1. Gorons sincerely believe that Vice President Gore is a true
    environmentalist, when he has an environmental disaster on his
own
farm: a
    polluting zinc mine, from which he received $500,000 of income
last
year.

2. Gorons likewise believe that the VP is anti-smoking and
anti-tobacco
    when he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted
government
    subsidies.

3. Gorons truly believe that Gore is a Vietnam war hero, when in
fact
he
    was placed by family influence in a "cushy" correspondent's job
and
the
    only action he saw was that of his Brownie camera!(and his bong)

4. Gorons actually believe that Al Gore is justified in illegally
raising
    political funds from the Office of the VP, simply because the
Vanderbilt
    Law educated VP claims he was ignorant of the illegality.

5. Gorons further believe that it was OK for Al Gore to accept large
sums
    of political money from China through Buddhist monks who had
taken
vows of
    poverty, since he again claimed ignorance.

6. Gorons also believe that the man who claimed to "invent the
internet"
    would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks of
    potentially incriminating e-mail!

7. Gorons, incredibly, believe Gore's claim that he and Tipper were
the
    models for the book and movie, "Love Story" even though the
book's
author,
    Erich Segal, says that's a bunch of crap.

8. Gorons, amazingly, believe that Gore will be the consumer's
champion
    against high gasoline prices although Gore holds a million
dollars
in
    Occidental Petroleum stock.

9. Gorons applaud Mr. Lieberman's open rejection of President
Clinton's
    immorality, but believe it was fine for Mr. Gore to remain
silent
on
the
    subject, while simultaneously declaring Mr. Clinton "one of the
greatest
    Presidents of our history."

  10. Gorons believe that Al Gore is an effective leader, when they
won't
    bother to look at his record as a Tennessee Senator, a record so
    ineffective that it has led to election of Republicans as BOTH
of
    Tennessee's senators.

  11. Gorons hold the belief that Gore is a compassionate man who will
be
    the working man's friend, in spite of the eviction notice he
served
to the
    poor family who complained about the conditions of the run down
slum
    house that he was renting to them.


  Cautionary Note:Medical researchers acknowledge the Gorons are
generally
   harmless, except when allowed into a voting booth. There,
unfortunately,
   overcome by their gullibility syndrome, they are apt to actually
vote
for
   Gore! They should be carefully protected from their ailment,
since
it
may
   be harmful to their well-being, yours, mine, and that of the USA.
   Therefore, PLEASE, heed the Surgeon General's warning, reach out
to
aid
   the Gorons in overcoming the syndrome, and PLEASE pass this on to
your
   normal friends, who might also know Gorons who need immediate
treatment.

Had a conversation with Dan Walker, V.P. of Development for the Rocky 
Mountain Elk Foundation concerning Enron's future as a partner.  Dan will be 
meeting with the CEO of the Foundation to pursue actions towards an Agreement 
or MOU between Enron and the RMEF.  Interest has been surprisingly high for 
employees within and without GPG expressing a desire to be involved with the 
Foundation.  

Assisted C/S No. 8, Corona with the development and submittal of the 
facility's Title V semi annual report and annual compliance certification 
report submittals.

Presented annual pollution prevention training for the Kingman and Flagstaff 
teams as required by the State of Arizona for large quantity generators of 
hazardous waste.

Received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air Quality Bureau, 
for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1 C/S which occurred 
in 1996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this issue in 1996 and 
assumed that the issue had been resolved. The issue in question was 
Transwestern's replacement of internal components from a smaller turbine to a 
larger turbine, with the internal components of the larger turbine components 
(inlet guide vane adjustment and removal of the regenerator) mechanically 
adjusted to simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.  When Transwestern 
received permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine 
capacity, Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments operable.   Apparently, 
EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to be outstanding 
as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the Compliance Order to 
review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern has 30 days to 
request another hearing.

Byron,

Below is the letter I committed to provide Arnold this afternoon.  I see
that Vadim beat me to it by sending you an earlier email.  As a general
commentary, I would however, like to make the following clarifications on
the subject which ETS may find useful.

Particulate matter in the gas tubine exhaust comes from a variety of sources
and may include smoke, ash, corrosion and erosion products, condensable
hydrocarbons, inlet air particulates and particulates from the fuel and
injected water or steam when applicable.  In addition, SO3 in the exhaust is
generally trapped on a wet collection medium as H2SO4 and may appear as
particulates due to the measurement procedure.

Gas turbines are very clean burning and are not, in general, sources of
significant quantities of particulate emissions when burning good quality
fuels.  With distillate fuel containing less than 0.5% by weight, sulfur,
total particulates at high power are expected to be less than 0.6 lbs. per
1000 lb. fuel as measured by EPA Method 5.  Please note that the method used
for measuring particulate matter can have a significant impact on the
particulate level determined.  For estimating purposes, all particulates may
be considered to be in the size range less than 10 micrometers.

With pipeline quality natural gas, there is virtually no smoke and the fuel
contains no sulfur or ash.  As a result, total engine generated particulate
emissions are generally undetectable by EPA Method 5.  Due to other
particulate sources and the sensitivity of the measurement method, total
particulates with pipeline quality natural gas for the LM2500 are estimated
to be less than 3 pounds per hour assuming cleanliness levels for the inlet
air, fuel, and water/steam injection in accordance with GE requirements.

Regards, Jos,.

Brian_Grant@cargill.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

I have not had any response to questions about whether Don is right
about NYISO simply going back to the way things were, but making that
assumption, I offer the following solution:

In my mind the way the market should work is that there should be "bid
guarantees" in real time.  I do not agree with the fact that there are
production cost guarantees and not sink price cost guarantees.  If there
were guarantees to all HAM bids, that would in turn lead to a more
efficient northeastern marketplace.

An example of an export:

I bid in the DAM to export power from NYISO to PJM. I bid 50, DAM clears
40, so get accepted to export 100 mw's.  Before the HAM commitments take
place, prices in NYISO are 200 while prices in PJM are 20, so I decide
it would be economical to leave the power in NYISO.  I have the ability
to change the HAM bid created from my accepted DAM bid, so I change the
bid to 100...saying that if NYISO is willing to pay 100, then I am
willing to cut my schedule to PJM...NYISO is forecasting 200, so they
cut my schedule.  One of two things happens now, if realtime clears
above my 100 HAM bid, then I buy at 40(DAM) and sell at realtime...If
realtime clears at under my 100 HAM bid, then NYISO needs to provide the
difference between my HAM bid and the realtime px.  The logic here is
that in effect, I already owned power at 40(just like a 40 generator)
and was willing to sell back my "generator" at 100, so if someone
commits my generator at 100, then they should be responsible for
compensating me.

An example of an import:

I bid into the DAM to import power to NYISO from PJM.  I bid 50, DAM
clears 60, so I get accepted to import 100 mw's.  Before the HAM
evaluation, prices in PJM are 200 while prices in NYISO are 30.  So I go
into my HAM bid and change the price from 50 to 150...HAM predicts 30,
cuts my import...thereby I am selling the power at 60, and buying it
back real time...once again two things can occur here...realtime clears
under my 150 bid, so I sell 60(DAM) and buy realtime....or realtime
clears at over my bid...in which case I sell 60(DAM) and buy back at my
150 HAM bid....the logic here is that my power at PJM(my generator)
which had committed itself at 60 in the DAM, was willing to stay flowing
to NYISO at up to 150(my HAM bid)...ie I am willing to take the
financial risk between 60 and 150....NYISO did not commit me in HAM, so
my financial risk should be capped at what I am willing to risk, not
what NYISO says I should be willing to risk

Some feed back so far...... There appears to be a problem brewing with
the
planned implementation of the May 29 adjustment that removes the $20K
bias from
the DAM external transactions.I am awaiting a call back on my concerns
from the
NYISO. By occasionally settling hourly prices through BME or
occasionally
settling after SCD sets RT prices, depending on the extistence or non
existence
of congestion, a problem that we thought we fixed many months ago will
reappear
with the removal of the $20K bias.Here is an example of my musings....

DAM bid gets accepted at  $50 ( Import from PJM)  .....  BME  then runs
(No
constraints)  evaluating the import HAM bids and other items that have
BMEprovide a $40 price.... DAM gets cut  , looks like  a $10 profit  (
providing
your loss in PJM doesn't exceed $10) . Due to in hour operations the RT
price
clears at $60. You loooooooose!!  Sound familiar? After getting beat up
like
this the MP's went through the committee structure and had the $20,000
adder
used for DAM (except IS+) to protect against this. The clearing at BME
for all
external  proxy busses removed the problem so the $20,000 adder was
removed. Now
the external interfaces only clear at BME if they are constrained. Are
we taking
a huge step back on purpose or was there a mistake in implementation?

Thanx George for the update.  

Norm would you mind visiting with Ms. Bernacik and explaining to her the 
difference between the excavation area where the underground tanks were 
removed and the landfarm area?  If need be we can write her another letter 
requesting the closure and backfilling of the underground storage tanks.

Subject: TW Laguna Station Remediation

I called Ms. Bernacik this afternoon regarding several issues. 
1.)  Ms. Bernacik indicated that the POEP has formed a Superfund division 
which is lead by a fellow named Mr. Rizvi. Mr. Rizvi had contacted Ms. 
Bernacik and requested the opportunity to be present at the site during the 
next semiannual sampling event. This event is tentatively scheduled for the 
week of June 19th. I am to notify Ms. Bernacik when we have set a firm date 
for sampling. 
2.)  Ms. Bernacik asked if we had received an extension to the off-site 
access permit from the Pueblo so that we could install the three additional 
wells. I indicated that I believe the extension was issued and Norm had 
picked it up but I wasn't certain. I followed-up with Norm and he has picked 
up the permit. Drilling activities are scheduled for the week of June 5th.
3.)  I asked Ms. Bernacik about our request for no further action on the UST 
removal. Ms. Bernacik indicated that Norm Moreno at the POEP had responded to 
her with comments on the request and recommended against closing the issue. 
Ms. Bernacik said that she would send us a copy of Mr. Moreno's letter. At a 
minimum, the Pueblo will require continued monitoring. This does not change 
our monitoring plan since we had already proposed continued monitoring of the 
UST area wells as part of our facility wide groundwater monitoring program. 
However, Ms. Bernacik also indicated that the Pueblo may require one or two 
additional monitor wells in the former UST area.
4.)  I asked Ms. Bernacik about backfilling the former UST excavation area. 
Ms. Bernacik indicated that her office had already issued an approval of TW's 
request to close the landfarm. I asked again about backfilling the excavation 
but was having difficulty communicating my interest was backfilling the 
excavation rather than closure of the landfarm. I reviewed the letter from 
Ms. Bernacik regarding closure of the landfarm and it does not specifically 
address backfilling the excavation. I believe that Ms. Bernacik is under the 
impression that her office has already approved backfilling the excavation, 
if we still want to get this in writing, it may be best for Norm to visit 
with Ms. Bernacik at her office in order to better explain what we need.

Hi Larry,

Thanks for completing the diamond information request form at 
http://www.DSOURCEVA.com

I did a preliminary search and found the following diamonds for you to 
consider.  There were many extremely nice diamonds at prices substantially 
below your budget so I have include a longer recommendation list than usual.  
This selection should help you determine what is the best value for you.

We filter out the 80 to 90% of diamonds that are cut poorly and only present 
to our customers diamonds that have great cut because we know that cut is the 
primary factor in a diamond's beauty, especially sparkle and fire.

With a round diamond, millimeter measurements are more important than the 
actual carat weight with regard to appearance. More carat weight does not 
necessarily mean more size.  For example, diamonds with depth percentages 
less than 60% will generally have a larger diameter, for the same carat 
weight, than those with depth percentages greater than 60% even though both 
diamonds could be ideal cut.  While we search for diamonds in the top cut 
classes, the preferred combination of depth and table percentages is a matter 
of personal taste and choice.  The three measurement numbers are the longest 
diameter, shortest diameter, and depth in millimeters.  The three letter 
codes after the measurement numbers are the Polish, Symmetry and Fluorescence 
ratings.

Prices in parenthesis are cash discount prices for wire transfers that are 3% 
reduction from credit card prices.  We need to check certification to assess 
specifications marked with ? below.

I've given you a little variety to consider because you need to decide on 
what your priorities are for the right diamond for you.

Which of these diamonds would you like us to order in for inspection?  If 
none of these is what you are looking for, what is it that you would like to 
see different?  The more feedback you can give us, the more effective we can 
be at finding the diamond of your dreams.  Remember, since we don't own these 
stones, we are your personal diamonds consultants who will work to find the 
very best diamond for you at a great price.

These diamonds were available as of Monday and we have copies of the 
certifications that we can share with you via email at your request.  High 
quality, well cut diamonds like these do not stay on the market long.  If you 
are interested in one of these diamonds, please let us know quickly so we can 
request the wholesaler put it on hold for us.

If you are looking for a really spectacular mounting, check out our favorite 
manufacturer's online catalog at http://www.18karati.com where you can click 
on Catalog then click on Wedding Rings to see pictures of some of the best 
craftsmanship in the industry.  This is a manufacturer's web site so there 
are no prices listed.  If you see something you like, give us the item 
numbers and we will get price quotes that are a fraction of regular retail 
prices.  Our customers have been thrilled with the quality and beauty of 
these mountings so we can highly recommend them to you.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST since we are dealing with customers and 
suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always want 
to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and 
answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Larry,
Call Kimberly or Gina and talk to them about how they would suggest doing 
this.  They are both great people to work with and have been so helpful on 
other initiatives.  I know they will have some ideas.  It may be that EBIZ 
could be used or some other internal company media.   John

John, I just spoke with Dan Walker, Vice President  of Development for the 
Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation about Enron's initiative for a corporation 
partnership.  After we had discussed our interest and desire and what 
opportunities are available with the Foundation for Enron, Dan stated that 
will be visiting with the Foundation's CEO next week and one of the issues to 
be discussed will be development of  an MOU or Agreement between Enron and 
the RMEF.  Looks like things are beginning to progress.

Im having quite a bit of interest from some of the Houston based Enron 
employees about how they can get involved.  Any suggestions on how I can 
"advertise" opportunities within the Corporation for employee involvement 
with the RMEF?

Ed, I would appreciate it very much if you would review the action item list 
from Scott Jones and choose which items are Koch's responsibility and which 
items  belong to EOTT, and let Scott and I know.  Ill contact Scott and have 
him send you the action item list for your review.  As I had previously 
mentioned, Scott and I have until 6/30 to complete the subsurface 
investigations and knowing which items are EOTT's and which are Koch's would 
greatly help us.  As Scott's server is down, Ill phone him and have him send 
you the action item list.  Again Thanks very much.

Sorry I have not responded sooner, but I've been tied up with the crude lines 
transaction.

The mercury contamination by the old meter shop and hydrocarbon contamiantion 
at the truck rack are Koch's responsibility.  Per EOTT/Koch contract, Koch 
must be allowed to do the remediation.  I sent Koch a letter in December 
requesting they undertake it.  I suggest a call (followed up by a letter) to 
Frank Van Ryn at Koch to set it up.  I'm happy to review or write such a 
letter.  But at this point, you guys should be coordinating with Koch for 
Koch to remediate.

If any other items on your audit need to be addressed (e.g., chromium), 
please let me know, as I will need to send a demand letter to Koch for them 
if they are Koch's responsibility.  Thanks.  --ETA

Louie/Ed I know you guys are busy, but because of the emphasis Enron places 
on ensuring that action items from consolidated audits are completed prior to 
the action item completion date, I really need to know how Scott and I are to 
proceed on the subsurface drilling activities for potential contamination at 
the Bakersfield Fractionator.  The scheduled completion date for six of the 
items is 6/30.  I understand the there is an issue concerning Koch's 
individual and shared responsibility for some of the issues identified during 
the audit.  Rich Jolly has contacted me asking me when the drilling will 
begin, as he does not want to see us exceed the 6/30 date and have the items 
show up as deliquent in his region.  Whatever you can do to assist us in 
either initiating the investigations or placing a hold on the drilling would 
be greatly appreciated.

To: NYISO BIC,

Last month I produced a BAWG Status Report presentation for the April 24,
2001 BIC meeting but unfortunately was not able to give that presentation
"in-person" because of a scheduling conflict with a sub-working group
meeting to discuss metering for the EDRP.  This status report is available
on the NYISO Web Site under April 24 BIC Meeting Materials and it is my
understanding that Garry Brown directed market participants to read that
presentation and contact Wes Yeomans or attend a BAWG meeting with
questions.

The last slide in that presentation did require action from the BIC
pertaining to direction on what to use for generation payments when the
NYISO orders a generator on line but the generator bid price expired.
Attached please find the last slide from the April 24, 2001 presentation.
I will be available by conference call on May 24 at 3:00 PM to lead the
discussion on this issue.

Wes Yeomans

Terry, the entire facility has not been disturbed.  Only most of it.  Id say 
approx 70%.  The other 30% has been impacted but not tot the point of 
disturbing all the vegetation, just foot and vehicle traffic.  I dont have 
problem with saying the above, but keep in mind, the facility has been there 
and just because the trees havent been disturbed, doesnt mean that the 
understory beneath the trees has been pristine.   It has always been 
Transwetern's policy to maintain an environmetnal presence at all of its 
locations, especially at sites where there is some aesthetic value (scenery 
wildlife etc).  I dont have a problem with including resource reports 3 and 7 
for vegetation and soils.  I have received a verbal from the US Fish and 
Wildlife and they agreed with the intent in my letter to them that pipline 
activites at each location tend to preclude any impacts to sensitive or 
critical habitats.  In addition, the adjacent lands are of the same habitat 
types as that which are contained within the facility and therefore, would 
not be an issue of habitat loss.   There are not any old TW hands around to 
positively verify that the site was cleanred and there has been natural 
encroachment of the trees into the area, I seriously doubt it.  Again, TW 
tried to mantain a postive presence at each site, but did utilize the sites 
for their intended purpose.

In Arizona, we do not have a blanket approval for discharges of hydrostatic 
testwater.  We do however plan to use new pipe and water supplied either from 
the closest City (ie Flagstaff for station 2 construction) or from a drinking 
well source.  In any event, we will test the water prior to discharge and 
ensure that the discharge will stay on the facility property to soak into the 
ground.  I cant imagine that there will be large volumes of hydro water as we 
dont plan on installing a large amount of new pipe.

If we need to discuss the above, give me a call

Subject: Station 2 Concerns


Larry,

I gave the tree issue at Station 2 some thought and I have a couple of
concerns regarding the environmental report.  The report is being written,
based on the fact that all construction will occur within the station yard
and on previously disturbed ground.  If we impact areas (even within
existing facilities) that were not previously disturbed we are required to
include environmental data about those areas.

So the first question is whether the entire station yard has been
"previously disturbed".  To help determine this, I downloaded a USGS aerial
(1996) of the station from the internet and the trees occurring within the
station yard look to be the same age/size as those surrounding the station.
This would indicate that the areas within the station covered with trees
have not been "previously disturbed".  A copy of the aerial is attached.

However, it is conceivable that the site was cleared prior to initial
construction and the trees simply grew back.  Unfortunately, I don't have
that information and don't know if you do either.  And let me point out that
my concern is not whether Transwestern will receive approval to construct,
but the amount of information supplied in the report.  I want to feel
comfortable that we are supplying the required information to FERC.

For this project, that would primarily include a description of the existing
vegetation and soils (resource report 3 and 7).  All we would really need is
a brief description of the existing vegetation and soils, and how much will
be permanently impacted, etc. However, we did not budget any time to obtain
this information, nor did we anticipate the need for site visits.

My hope is that we can find an answer to whether the site was previously
disturbed or not.  If not, I hope to come up with some verbiage that
everyone is comfortable with to satisfy the FERC requirements.  Otherwise,
we will have to obtain the necessary information, and that's beyond our
initial scope.

If you have had any biological reports done for the area on other projects,
that may provide enough information.  Again, it only needs to be brief.
Also, we need to verify for the other 3 stations that we are constructing in
previously disturbed areas.

Lastly, Arnold has indicated that the hydro-test water will come from
existing water source at each station and that it will be discharged under
Transwestern's blanket permit.  Please verify...and I think we should
provide a copy of the blanket permit with the filing.

After you have had a chance to think about this, please call and we can
discuss.

Terry.

Larry, per your request following our phone conversation today I'm forwading 
a brief note regarding our dinner meeting last night with the Arizona Chapter 
of the Nature Conservancy.  

Hank Hull (Flagstaff Team leader) and I met with Edward Smith, the Northern 
Arizona Program Ecologist with the Nature Conservancy, here out of 
Flagstaff.  The purpose of the meeting was to make introductions between Ed 
and Hank and to informally discuss opportunities in which the Flagstaff Team 
could support the local chapter.  The Flagstaff Team made a committment in 
their Team Objectives and each team member in their Peer Committments to 
support the Conservancy in some manner this year.  To date all eight of the 
Flagstaff Team members (2 positions currently vacant) have taken advantage of 
the free membership offered through ETS.  Also, Ed was quite impressed with 
ETS's sponsorship of the employee and family memberships.  I won't get into 
the details but, it was obvious that opportunities will exist for the Team to 
become active in local activities.  So, as a follow up to the meeting, Ed 
will make a list of the areas and locations the Conservancy is in need of 
help and forward this list to Hank who will then poll the various Team 
members and solicit volunteers.  This may take a couple of weeks to get up 
and running but we should be well on our way by June.  Our goal, for now, 
will be to committ on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis to providing a 
given number of volunteer hours.  I'll keep you posted on how things 
progress.  

Ed also, offered to come out to one of the Team's meetings and give the group 
an overview of the Arizona Chapter of the Nature Conservancy and discuss our 
involvement with the entire Team.  And last but not least, when you, Bill, 
John, Rich and Randy come out for your West End field trip we may be able to 
coordinate a dinner get togeather with Ed to discuss any topics of interest.  
Just a thought.....   

Have a good week.......

Larry,

Please take a look at the attached excel file for the 7400 ft elevation.  I 
have
calculated both NOx and CO at 100% and 50% load.

If the CO emissions cause a problem, I can investigate with our engineering
department to see if there is an on-engine control mechanism that can be
employed.

Let's talk after you have had a chance to review.

Best regards,

With respect to the September 13, 1999 letter from Richard and Oreane Garcia 
concerning pipeline integrity  and noise issues, Transwestern Pipeline 
Company offers the following response:

Pipeline Integrity.  With the construction of the evaporation ponds over 
Transwestern's right of way and pipline, Transwestern has closely monitored 
the potential for  impacts for the pipeline.  This includes a more frequent 
inspection of the pipeline conditions underlying the ponds by taking 
potentiometric readings to verify that  corrosion is not present.  
Transwestern has also installed rectifiers to assist in eleminating the 
potential of pipeline corrosion.  As a DOT requirement, Transwestern has 
cathodically protected the entire pipeline system with an external pipeline 
coating to further ensure the integrity of the pipeline underlying the 
evaporation ponds.   The pipline safety  measures implemented by Transwestern 
are designed to not only identify corrosion iimpacts to the pipeline system 
at   the inception of detrimental impacts as a result of corrosion, but also 
allow for long term stability and integrity  by conducting state of the art 
monitoring and detection. 

Noise Issue.  In the initial environmental assessment and study, Transwestern 
conducted baseline surveys of the area to determine existing noise levels.  
This study was completed to assist Transwestern in the mitigation measures 
which will be implemented after construction of the Gallup Compresso 
Station.  Pending completion of the facility, Transwestern will conduct post 
noise studys to determine whether facility noise levels have increased above 
those levels mandated by FERC.  In the event of operational noise levels 
exceeding the FERC regulatory level of 55 ldn, Transwestern is committed to 
performing any and all  mitigation measures necessary to ensure that the post 
noise level of the facility will not be above the level mandated by FERC.

Decrepancy of trailer park residents.  In the letter by Mr. Garcia, it was 
stated that Transwestern's assessment of the number of residences in the 
adjacent trailer park  was not 18 as had been stated in our original study, 
but "more like 35 trailers".  The number of mobile home residences currrently 
in the trailer park may in fact be closer to 35.  Transwestern's trailer park 
residence count was taken in the winter of the year when the fluctuating job 
market is normally down and the number of residences in the park was low.  
The transient nature of mobile home residences and the fluctuating job 
economy of the area is probably a direct reflection of the up and down nature 
of the residences.  It should also be noted that during the time that the 
trailer park count was made, the owner of the trailer park who is also the 
operator of the evaporation ponds was experiencing major difficulties in the 
operation of the  ponds and raw sewage  had overflowed the pond embankments 
and  had resulted in the raw sewage ponding in the yards of many of the 
trailer park residents.  It was actually noted that many of the spaces 
normally occupied by mobile homes had been vacated.  This unsanitary 
condition was also identified by the New Mexico Environment Department.  The 
NMED had implemented enforcement actions against the trailer park owner.

Alison, have you found out anything about the above referenced?  The deadline 
for submitting the FY 2001 emissions fee is April 30.  The TNRCC can levee a 
fine on the facility if we dont provide them with some informaiton pretty 
fast.  Your assistance in this will be appreciated.

In light of the Koch indemnity, at minimum we'll need to come up with a 
specific reason for each area, based on California standards, and to 
communicate that rationale to Koch prior to doing any substantial work -- 
certainly before boring.  Thanks.

Additional Soil Investigations, North Coles Levee


After reveiwing the documents entitled, "Baseline Environmental Investigation 
of Arco North Coles Levee Plant 8, Rogas Loading Facility and Associated 
Natural Gas Pipeline Systems Kern County, California" and "Report of 
Preliminary Asessment Sampling North Coles Levee Gas Plant Loading Rack Area 
Tupman, California", it appears that the following areas should be 
investigated further to detemine horizontal and vertical extent of  
identified contamination from the above referenced reports:

 Tank 15 area-  total petroleum hydrocarbons

 Glycol reboiler area- total petroleum hydrocarbons

 Hot oil heater area- total petroleum hydrocarbons

   Wash rack area- lead

 Propane comp. area lead  
    total petroleum hydrocarbons
    chromates

 Cooling tower area- chromates

 Compressor area- BTEX
    chromates
    lead

In the "Baseline Environmental Investigation" report, sampling was only 
conducted to an approximate depth of 2.5'.  I am not comfortable with basing 
decisions for further investigations on such a shallow depth, in leau of the 
fact that  many times water soluble constituents may horizonatlly move 
vertically from surface shallow depths into the lower subsurface areas.  This 
is indeed the case for chromates.  I based my recommendations for metal 
concentrations on the federal RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste target levels 
for metals and evaluated  the TPH and BTEX levels with the  underground 
storage tank guidlines for California.  There were references to a 1989 
document in the "Baseline" report for specific parameters, but there may have 
been an update to target contamination level requirements since that date and 
therefore, I used 10,000 ppm which is a general action level for most states 
for total petroleum hydrocarbons.  Again, I did not evaluate the mercury or 
the loading rack issues.

One last issue.  As you know, identification of contamination is usually 
accomplished by sight observations of visible contamination, knowledge of 
processes and or history.  Report results of the surface contamination do not 
show there to be an immediate environmental concern.  Due to the age of the 
facility, there may be concerns which were not identified in the reports.  
However, based upon the locations of the preliminary samplings which were 
conducted throughout the facility, it appears that the information presented 
in the reports would be adequate to address suspected contamination at the 
facility.

"Kirkpatrick, Joe" <joe.kirkpatrick@nrgenergy.com> writes to the 
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

The NYISO has chosen $150 as representative of a level to trigger market
mitigation. I believe the basis for this was a determination of a price
that was calculated to be representative of the statewide price of $50.
A 300% increase or an increase of $100 is $150, coincidently the same
price.

I am questioning the determination of this price ($50) and its
application in the market mitigation plan.

In determining market power according to the market mitigation plan
specific generator or unit bids are examined to identify economic
withholding. How does the $50 price reference a specific unit, I am not
sure where in the Market Mitigation Plan it says to examine the entire
statewide price and then compare it to a generator's bid.

If a generator's fuel costs (without fixed cost recovery) is $150 that
unit would presumably never bid below its cost, it would always bid as a
minimum $150. How could that generator exceed the thresholds identified
in the market mitigation plan. A 300% increase would be $450 and an
increase of $100 would be $250, and yet using the AMP interpretation of
the mitigation plan the threshold for identifying economic withholding
is $150.
It would seem that the AMP methodology is improperly applying the Market
Mitigation Plan. The Mitigation Plan is supposed to identify generator
conduct and clearly in the application of the AMP it is not.

The simple question would be is the $150 threshold representative of
every generator's bid to determine economic withholding. The answer can
only be no, how can it be?

The Market Mitigation Plan was intended to determine whether a generator
was exercising market power. The determination of whether a generator
was exercising market power would and should take into consideration all
of the prevalent market, unit and system conditions to determine if that
unit was in fact exercising market power. The more complex the system
the more complex the analysis of whether marker power was exercised.

How does a price trigger (or any automatic threshold) take all of the
complexities of a situation into account? It cannot, I suspect that is
why due process is required whether it is a court case or a market power
determination. The full facts are presented and evaluated, every case is
unique and requires deliberation and analysis of every supporting fact.
In other words automatic judgement is not an option and yet under the
NYISO AMP it is offered as a solution.


I do agree that prices should not be posted in the DAM if they are high
as a result of market power. A better solution would be to delay the
prices or hold them in reserve until a proper determination is made. In
the same way that prices are held in reserve for software flaws they
should be held in reserve for determination of market power. Prices can
be posted and flagged subject to change pending review of market power,
at least then due process can be followed. Market participants can be
consulted in accordance with the Plan and if required SCUC can be rerun.

External proxy bus prices may need to be frozen to ensure that flows are
consistent with the orginal DAM posting if a longer period of time is
required for market power evaluation. The AMP is still in place but is
only used to identify potential market power until a "human" evaluation
is done.

The third quarter PCB meeting with Southern California Gas Company was held 
this morning.  SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management 
and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for 
$120,602.19.  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating 
expenses for PCB activities in California.

The public hearing was held in Williams, AZ for the Kingman and Flagstaff air 
permits under the Redrok Expansion.  There were no comments or concerns 
brought up at the meeting as no individuals came to the meeting.  An email 
was received from the ADEQ presenting the minor additions which will be added 
to each permit.  Each comment and addition will not impact or change the 
draft permits which were received earlier this month.  The permits for 
Klagetoh and Luepp were received from the EPA last week.  The permits from 
the ADEQ for the Kingman and Flagstaff C/S will be issued the later part of 
this week. 

Attended the incident investigation and technical writing workshop in Omaha.

Assisted the Mountainair team with the semiannual Title V compliance 
monitoring report  for C/S No.7.

A meeting was held in Phoenix, Az with PG&E to review charges and invoices by 
PG&E for PCB management and disposal activities on their system for the last 
several months.   Also discussed was recent liquids sampling results and 
proposed PCB activities on the PG&E system for 2002.

Hi Larry,

Per our conversation today, I want to make sure I understand your intent
for the transition periods for Klagetoh and Leupp.  Below are two
conditions from the draft Klagetoh permit.  We would use the same approach
for Leupp.  Please let me know whether we have understood your intent
correctly.  Note that there will also be some associated recordkeeping
requirements.

The following conditions apply during the transition period.  The
transition period is defined as the six month period that starts on the
first day that Emission Unit 404 (GE gas turbine) or Emission Units  423 or
424 (Catepillar generator engines) operates.

     1.        During the transition period, Emission Units 401, 402, and
          403 (Clark compressor engines) shall not operate simultaneously
          with Emission Unit 404 (GE gas turbine). [40 CFR
          71.6(a)(13)(iii), 71.6(b), 71.7(e)(1)(i)(A)(4)(i)]

     2.        During the transition period, either Emission Unit 421 or
          422 (Waukesha generator engines) may operate simultaneously with
          either Emission Unit 423 or 424 (Catepillar generator engines).
          Under no circumstances may Emission Unit 421 operate
          simultaneously with Emission Unit 422, nor may Emission Unit 423
          operate simultaneously with Emission Unit 424. [40 CFR
          71.6(a)(13)(iii), 71.6(b), 71.7(e)(1)(i)(A)(4)(i)]

			How 'Bout Some Tonic With That Gin?
			The game of Gin was Hollywood's game. When it stormed through that town in 
the '40s, you could see Gin being played on the silver screen by all types of 
movie stars. Refined in the early 1900s at the Knickerbocker Whist Club in 
New York, Gin is the perfect social card game. It's not so strategic as to 
preclude chatting, but it still provides real competitive kick and a gleeful 
way to gloat when the cards are laid down, and "Gin" is scored. Not every 
online gaming site has Gin. But it's taking off on PlaySite. Take a break 
from your day and try it! 
			
			
			
			
			[IMAGE]
			
			[IMAGE]
			[IMAGE]
			
			Tournament Time
			What better way to test your gaming skills than to compete in an online 
tournament with other top-ranked competitors? PlaySite offers automatically 
scheduled tournaments in seven games: Backgammon, Checkers, Chess, Go-Moku, 
Hex, Mancala and Reversi. Some games have tournaments geared for the 
beginning player. Backgammon has tournaments for those rated Under 1500 and 
an Open class. Checkers and Chess both have tournaments for those rated Under 
1300 and a separate Open class. 
			
			Playing in a tournament is easy and fun. Go to your favorite game page, and 
click to enter the tournament room. You'll see areas for tournament info, 
signups, games, a history of prior tournaments and a schedule for upcoming 
tournaments. PlaySite tourneys run throughout the day. Get a complete look at 
the schedule here...

			A: 
			1574 in Madrid, Spain. Wilhelm Steinitz claimed the first official world 
championship after he beat Adolf Anderssen in 1866.

			Q: 
			Who is the current United States chess champion?
			
			[IMAGE]
			[IMAGE]
			A: 
			Grandmaster Joel Benjamin with a United States Chess Federation rating of 
2650. Benjamin appeared in the 1993 chess movie "Searching for Bobby Fischer."

John, Lou, Cutty, Bill, I want to bring this issue back up for your 
attention, as I know that everyone is very busy.  During the EPA Title V 
inspection at the Laguna C/S this past week, Barbara Bernacek, the Laguna 
environmental person was present.  She had been asked to be there by the 
EPA.  During our tour of the facility, she casually asked if any progress or 
decision had been made by Enron management towards remediation assistance in 
the groundwater issue at the Laguna C/S.  I had informed her that we were 
still actively discussing this issue and would contact her in the near future 
concerning management's decision.  I would appreciate it very much if each of 
you would revisit my memo below and  then lets discuss what should be done 
and the approach we should take in addressing the Laguna's concern about a 
proactive approach to reaching cleanup and closure.

Subject: Meeting with the Laguna's over the PCB remediation at C/S 6

I wanted to present this summary of the meeting Transwestern had with 
representatives of the Laguna Pueblo concerning the status of the PCB 
remediation activities by TW.  On the Laguna side were members of the Laguna 
pueblo, the PEOP a  technical oversight group that provides expertise and 
assistance on technical issues for all of the 19 pueblos in New Mexico 
(ranging from UST to superfund), and members of ETS ( 5 members of the Laguna 
team, Butch Russell, Rick Smith  (advisor for the Laguna team), myself)  and 
George Robinson.   This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a 
half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest 
in environmental activities on their pueblo.

The meeting centered around two issues at the site: the closure of the UST 
and the PCB remediation activity.  With respect to the first, concensus was 
reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples 
at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis, 
and send the results to POEP for review. 

With repsect to the PCB remediation issue, things were a little different.  
The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal 
Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is 
presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals 
toward  achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the 
Lagunas have verified this.  They indicated that that have been patient with 
Transwstern's attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB 
contamination, but based upon the historic sampling results, that this 
technology is not proving to be very successful, in fact the results have 
shown stagnant results  (Im using their words).  They would like to see 
Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup 
and closure of this site.   Members of the Laguna pueblo, who work for the 
POEP,  expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact 
future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of 
Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their 
lands.   One member of the Laguna pueblo called the contamination a "cancer"  
with potential to spread.   A comment was made by the POEP that there was a 
major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination 
if we continue to just maintain  our present approach of just monitoring the 
site and installing additional wells..

A member of the POEP has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from 
North Dakota State University, (Energy and Environmental Research Center) who 
claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered 
difficult to remediate (this site would certainly fall into this category due 
to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and 
channels present which direct  the PCB containing liquids present at the 
site).  Although the POEP was not recommending Transwestern utilize their 
service, they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site 
with them.

It shold also be mentioned that Syed Risvi, the POEP Superfund representative 
was at this meeting.  He had mentioned that the  POEP has been in discussions 
with EPA Region VI concerning potential classification of the site on the 
CERCLIS list of sites for inclusion on the NPL..  He had indicated that he 
did not want to see this site included on the list, but stated that 
Transwetern needed to update and show postive results in our remediation 
efforts and that it was the tribal councils opinion that this was not being 
done.

At the conclusion of the meeting, I informed the POEP that Transwestern's 
internal remediation group  would contact the NDSU group and discuss the site 
characteristics with them and we would reprot back to them the results of our 
discussions.  This seemed to satisify the  POEP and they were content with 
this. 

John, I would like to schedule a conference call with the above list of 
people and discuss this issue.  A couple of things I want to bring out.  
First, we will be undergoing ROW and Compressor Station renewals with the 
Lagunas in the near future.  Second, on the Laguna tribal lands, they have 
experienced other releases of contimation and are currently very sensitive to 
this whole  contamination problem.  Although we are considered by the POEP as 
proactive up to this point  and very easy to work with (direct quote from the 
POEP)   they are wanting a more proactive and measurable effort from 
Transwestern to clean up the PCBs. 
Please get back with me on this.

On May 24, 2001 the Business Issues Committee will consider proposed Stage
2 modifications to the NYISO Market Administration and Control Area
Services Tariff, including changes to reflect a conversion from ICAP to
UCAP, and from a six-month to a one-month Obligation Procurement Period.
The Department of Public Service offers the attached comments on the
proposal and on the need for a "hard look" at ICAP rules, in general.

Scott, I shold probably clearify something.  The existing right of way, which 
we intend on staying in, at least around Cordes Junction is located west of 
I-17, which will not impact the Agua Fria National Monument, which occurs on 
the east side of the interstate.  Should we be forced to move to the east 
side of I-17, then the Monument may become a problem.  Like you, I was taking 
into consideration all possible issues in the pathway of the proposed 
construction and also those that are in the near proximity and have the 
potential of becoming an "opportunity" in the event we are forced to deal 
with them.  I appreciate your wirk in this......

Gentlemen,

Attached is our work to date (minus the telephone call summary sheets and
permit requirement summary sheets [Appendix A] you've already received) on
the Fatal Flaw Analysis/Briefing Report for Project Sundevil (or is it The
Sundevil Project, or Sun Devil [2 words, rather than 1])?  It truly is a
working document, and can be expanded in areas as you see fit, or there may
be other areas you may want us to discontinue researching.  This review
draft is provided for your review and input as to where you might like it
expanded and where you might like effort to be discontinued.  As I mentioned
yesterday, I will be out of town the remainder of the week.  Please contact
Jon Alstad in my absence with any action items and input you may have.
Thanks,  Scott

John, I read Phil's statements concerning the Redrock air permit issue and 
would like to make sure everyone has the facts why  Transwestern was unaware 
of the delay in the agencies issance of the air permits.  I had met with each 
agency prior to submitting each application (February of this year) to ensure 
that each application contained the correct and proper information required 
by the EPA and State of Arizona.  When I told them that we would need the 
permits by the end of September, each agency indicated that a September 
permit issuance would not be a problem, in light of the fact that energy 
issues related to California were to be given top priority.   On a monthly 
baiss I phoned the  permit engineer assigned to each application to be kept 
aware of possible conflicts and resolve any concerns.  In all monthly calls, 
both agencies assured me that the permits were progressing on schedule.  As 
we approached the anticipated September issuance calls to the agencies were 
conducted weekly and this was when I was first informed of the 1-4 month 
additional time beyond the September issuance which would be required for the 
permit issuance.

A TRUE FRIEND

When you are sad ...
I will get you drunk and help you plot revenge
against the scum sucking bastard who made you sad.

When you are blue ...
I'll try to dislodge what ever's choking you.

When you smile ...
I'll know you finally got laid.

When you are scared ...
I will rag you about it every chance I get.

When you are worried ...
I will tell you horrible stories about how much worse it could be and tell
you to quit whining.

When you are confused ...
I will use little words to explain it to your dumb ass.

When you are sick ...
Stay the hell away from me until you're well again, I don't want whatever
you have.

When you fall ...
I will point and laugh at your clumsy ass.

This is my oath ...
I pledge till the end. Why you may ask? ...
Because you're my friend.

Greetings,

Take note of these recent developments.....

Note Commissioner Massey's Statement that the first decision effectively
precludes implementation of the AMP for most of the summer period.

 Organization Announcement (Correction) 

I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused.  I had 
indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not 
correct.  Ken will be supporting  OEC.  Corrected announcement is provided 
below. 

 It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined Enron Corp. 
EH&S Asset Operations.  He will be reporting directly to Donnie Willmann and  
will support Central America, Caribbean and OEC.  Ken has over 25 year 
experience in environmental, health and safety for the oil and gas 
industry.   He has been working for Enron since 1996 and has extensive 
international experience.    We are excited to have Ken in our team so, 
please welcome Ken in his new role.

Dear Market Participants,

The NYISO is pleased to inform you about the following
enhancements to the public web server (www.nyiso.com), MIS and
SPIDER that will be implemented on May, 01, 2001.
:

*  The software required to implement the Automated Mitigation
Process (AMP) will be deployed to the MIS and SPIDER systems. The
Automated Mitigation Process is the automation of existing market
mitigation procedures for the proactive mitigation of energy
suppliers who are about to exercise market power with a subsequent
price impact.  Activation of the software is pending.

*  A new version of the Moving Range Chart web application will be
deployed (Originally scheduled April 24th , 2001).

*  The process to generate all the files posted for real-time LBMP
data to the NYISO web site (OASIS) will be changed to use XML
technology in order create the files faster, neater and more
reliably. The files Market Participants use in the OASIS will not
change.  Previously a product called InfoReports was used to
generate those web postings.

Changes #: KKIR-4VQSTF; RMUY-4VPRUZ; VLEE-4VQPHQ; MDSO-4VPSM6

If you notice any NYISO systems behave other than intended after
the scheduled implementation date, please let us know immediately.

It will be helpful if you refer to this notice if you communicate
with us about these changes.

Thank you,
NYISO Customer Relations

Louie/John, this memo summerizes the results of the environmental due 
diligence which was performed on the Texas Panhandle and Cortez, Colorado 
portions of Equilon pipline system for which EOTT may be interested in 
purchasing.  This memo presents those environmental issues which may be or 
were identified as a potential environmental concern.  

Lefors (Texas Panhandle Segment)

Assets on this portion of the system which may have environmental  issues 
were the following:  1-80,000 bbl. liquids product storage tank, 41 small 
tank batteries consisting of 1-3 product storage tanks each.  Average tank 
size is 210 bbl.  Approximately 15 tank locations are within 1/4 mile of an 
existing waterway.  There are stream and river crossings included in this 
package.  The pipeline crossings viewed appeared to have sufficient  soil 
coverage and did have block valves on the upstream and downstream portions of 
the pipeline crossings.  

1. Clean Air Act.  There were no records kept at any office or location which 
would assist in the determination of compliance with Title III, or Title V.  
The  following documents were not present:  emissions inventories and or 
records of fees paid, O&G MACT compliance (HAP's),  operating permits.  NSPS  
Supart Kb compliance could not be determined also.  The 80,000 bbl tank 
construction date was in the 1930's and has a fixed roof.  It has a concrete  
bottom and the  tank has never been emptied for inspection.  No  Railroad 
Commission 653 inspection has ever been conducted.

2. Clean Water Act.  Although soil berm and containments were present around 
all tanks that were inspected, SPCC plans were not available at any 
location.   Interviews with the Equilon personnel stated that there had never 
been a reportable release from this tank.  In addition, location Texaco MB  
Davis pump  station had a small 3'x4' UST which received liquids from leaking 
packing material which had overflowed and visible soil staining was present.  
At this  location a T-stand pipe had been constructed into the soil berm to 
allow discharge of rainwater from the containment area.  This water 
discharged into  an ephermal arroyo which ultimately collects into the North 
Fork of the Red River, a perennial stream.

3. NESHAPS.  At the Lefors Station, there exists several joints of new and 
used pipe which is suspected of having external coating and pipe wrapping   
containing asbestos.

4. NORMS.  A NORM survey has not been conducted on any portion of the assets 
which are identified in the bid package.

5. Soil Staining.   There was minor soil staining at all locations inspected.

6. There is one active groundwater remediation in progress identified as the 
"10 mile hole".  Equilon will retain ownership of this issue.  There had been 
two  pipeline remediation projects for which Equilon had reported to the TRRC 
and had remediated the site.

7. TSCA.  One electrical transformer was discovered at the Lefors Station.   
It had been tested and determined to not have PCB's.

8. Safe Drinking Water Act.  There was an abandoned drinking water well at 
the Lefors Station.  It had not been in service for an undetermined period of 
time. 

9. RCRA.  There was an abandoned out of service Fox boro meter at the Lefors 
Station.  Status of the potential releases of mercury could not be visibally  
determined.

Bug-Patterson Gathering System (Cortez, Colorado)

This system includes the following:

 Lady Bug Station  minor incidental equipment at this location. 

1. There were no environmental issues at this site from assets owned by 
Equilon.  Adjacent to this site was a producer site which had been blowing   
hydrocarbon liquids into an earthern unlined pit.  There was historic use of 
this pit.  Although surface contamination from this pit was present, it was 
not  known whether subsurface soil and groundwater conditions underlying the 
Equilon assets had been impacted.

 Patterson Station 1-10,000 bbl floating roof steel product storage tank with 
fiberglass bottom, installation date 1981, one propane driven waukesha F817GU 
engine horsepower unknown,  

1. Clean Air Act.  There were no records kept at any office or location which 
would assist in the determination of compliance with Title III, or Title V or 
the  construction permit notification process administered by the Colorado 
Department of Public Health and Environment.  The  following documents were 
not  present:  emissions inventories and or records of fees paid, O&G MACT 
compliance (HAP's),  operating or construction permits.  NSPS subpart Kb   
compliance could not be determined.   Determination of the permitting status 
for the six cylinder Waukesha could not be determined. 

2. Clean Water Act.  Although soil berm and containments were present, an 
SPCC plan was not available at this location.  Interviews with the Equilon   
personnel stated that there had never been a reportable release from this 
tank.  Rainwater which collected into the containment was discharged into an  
ephermal arroyo by a pipe constructed into and through the dirt containment.

3. NORMS.  A NORM survey has not been conducted on any portion of the assets 
which are identified in the bid package.

4. Minor soil staining was present around the 10,000 bbl tank.

5. Adjacent to this site was a producer site which had been blowing  
hydrocarbon liquids into an earthern unlined pit.  There was historic use of 
this pit.   Although surface contamination from this pit was present, it was 
not known whether subsurface soil and groundwater conditions underlying the   
Equilon assets had been impacted.

Patterson Junction  1-10,000 bbl floating roof steel product storage tank 
with fiberglass bottom installation date 1987. Electrical pumps were present 
to transfer liquids from the 10,000 bbl tank to the truck loading facilities. 

1. Clean Air Act.  There were no records kept at any office or location which 
would assist in the determination of compliance with Title III, or Title V or 
the  construction permit notification process administered by the Colorado 
Department of Public Health and Environment.  The  following documents were 
not  present:  emissions inventories and or records of fees paid, O&G MACT 
compliance (HAP's),  operating or construction permits.  NSPS subpart Kb   
compliance could not be determined.   Determination of the permitting status 
for the six cylinder Waukesha could not be determined. 

2. Clean Water Act.  Although soil berm and containments were present, an

ephermal arroyo by a pipe constructed into and through the dirt containment.

3. NORMS.  A NORM survey has not been conducted on any portion of the assets 
which are identified in the bid package.

4. Minor soil staining was present around the 10,000 bbl tank and transfer 
pumps.

5. A small bucket had been placed into the ground, below ground surface to 
collect liquids from meter.  


Cortez Office.  In the office yard, several environmental issues were present 
and are listed as follows:

 old spent 12 volt batteries
 empty drums
 open buckets containing oil and oilfield sludge

The  pipeline stream crossing at the Montezuma Creek  showed the pipeline to 
be exposed in the bottom of the creek for a distance of approx. 12 feet.  
There were block valves on the upstream and downstream segments of this 
crossing.

 














and the equipment in the Cortez office building.

Subject: Environmental Notice

Attached for your review are the technical version and summary version of 
Environmental Notices on the revised Texas upset and maintenance reporting 
rules. The rules were passed this summer so this is a bit late getting out, 
but as you know I was in Puerto Rico at the time.

I am still trying to get clarification from TNRCC on their basis for 
requiring you to include Nitrogen and CO2 when determining the Reporting 
Quantity (RQ) for natural gas. I don't believe this is a very important issue 
at most locations but I am not sure TNRCC is correct on this issue. Your 
thoughts on this are welcome.

If you could provide comments by November 29 it would be appreciated. Since I 
am not up on all the ETS organizational changes, help with the distribution 
list would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Marc

The list I have is years old.  Fortunately, the names in Deal Entry and Deal 
Blotter are alphabetical so you do not need to know the codes.  The power 
short codes are not consistent with the NERC codes so this would probably not 
help you.  Attached is a list of CPs with whom we deal.

safety specialists, env. and safety group in Houston, Danny Pribbles direct

Subject: RE: Draft, Flagstaff Spring meeting


Meeting Planning Team,
This like it is on target at this point.  You should probably circulate the
draft to Pribble, after you are comfortable with it, to get his preliminary
buy-in.  Now, I do have a few questions.  Is someone talking with the
Little America Hotel in Flagstaff and blocking out enough rooms for our
meeting?  When can we get some preliminary dates (How about the week of
April 22, 2002?)???   If that week is not good, then go to the second week
in May as I will have serious conflicts with the first week of May.  Also,
who will be in charge of planning the evening dinners?  I would like to
talk with that person as I have a couple of "fun" ideas to offer about
where we might go for dinner.  Thanks to both the North Safety Team and the
SW Environmental Team for taking a lead role in this.  John

Shudeish, I spoke with Roger Kohn, Region IX EPA permit engineer, about the 
time his agency will take to do the air permit reveiw for Kingman and 
Flagstaff.  He stated that EPA normally gets the allowed 45 days to do the 
permit review, however, at the request of the state agency, his office will 
do an expidited review.  Because of the urgency of Transwetern desiring to 
initiate construction, by this email, I am asking the ADEQ to request  an 
expidited review  of the Kingman and Flagstaff air permits from the EPA.

Again, thanks for your work and effort that you have put in on this project.

I received a phone call from Frank Van Ryn of Koch, concerning the letter 
that was sent to him on 6/19.  Frank has stated that Koch will be contacting 
Arco concerning the two contamination issues.  Apparently Koch has been 
indemnified by Arco for the mercury issue and possibly the hydrocabon issue 
at well.  In any event, Frank said that he would be getting back with me in a 
couple of weeks to present a plan and initiate the cleanup, but wanted to 
discuss the issue with Arco.
I will keep everyone apprised on the progress.

Subject: Dating Asian Women


Don't get offended, it's only a joke...obviously written by some bitter Asian 
guy.

Caucasian women:
First date: You get to kiss her good night.
Second date: You get to grope all over and make out.
Third date: You get to have sex in the missionary position. Then you promise 
to marry her but will probably abandon the idea.

Indian women:
First date: You meet the girl.
Second date: You set the wedding date.
Thrid date: The wedding night.



Chinese women:

First date: You get to buy her an expensive dinner but nothing happens.
Second date: You buy her an even more expensive dinner but nothing happens 
too.
Third date: You don't even get to the third date and you have already 
realized nothing is going to happen.

Vietnamese girls:
First date: What first date? ... no such thing
Second date: You get married to some girl you've never seen before from 
overseas.
Third date: You divorce, get paid $10,000 from her family (minus a percentage 
from the guy that set you up).but only after you've helped them all immigrate 
to Canada or US take your pick.

Filipino girls:
First date: It took you forever to get a date with this really hot chick of 
your dreams (that has a killer bod), but she won't let you even kiss her.
Second date: She takes you to church and everyone thinks you're really cute 
and such a nice guy; but you still haven't even kissed her because she's a 
"proper girl".
Third date: You kiss for the first time, but miraculously she ends up 
pregnant and you have to marry her or her cousins, brothers, uncles, etc., 
will cut your penis off, and you keep wondering what happened!? Even more 
miraculous: the kid IS yours!

Korean girls:
First date: She only went out with you cause she hates the steroid-pumped, 
chauvinistic Korean guys that
are always after her.

Second date: She flirts with all your friends, but ignores you.

Third date: She's dumped you and is going out with a black guy that is 3 
times your size (in every way). She doesn't even "remember" who you are, 
neither do her friends so you have no chance of ever going out again with a 
Korean chick cause they all talk and you were an asshole anyway.

Japanese women:
First date: She's shy, so you don't get to kiss her at all.
Second date: She'll take a bath in front of you and let you smell her panties.
Third date: You get to have kinky sex with her. Then she will bid you 
sayonara as that was her fling before getting married to a Japanese man.



Thai girls:
First date: You flirted with her while she was giving you a really bad lap 
dance.
Second date: You go play pool, see a movie, or meet at a club and she tells 
you how she is making so little money here, but better than her computer 
programming job back in Thailand. You're not really paying attention though 
because this is the first time you've seen her in the light and without 
make-up, the smoky haze, and the influence of alcohol.she is BUTT ugly!
Third date: She smiles and says hi as she passes you while she's on her way 
over to the table with all the
Chinese/Vietnamese gangsters.  She'll spend the rest of the night 
lap-dancing/smoking/talking with them.
You're afraid to look over cause you think you'll get shot or jumped in the 
parking lot. You vow to never go
there again, at least till your friend tells you about "this really hot chick 
he saw there."



And finally ...

ABC (American Born Chinese) girls:
First date: She met you in a group of people and you were the only Asian guy 
in the group. In fact you two are the only Asians in the group cause you're 
both bananas. People think you two should go out cause you're both 
Chinese."   Second date: You go to dim sum, but neither of you can order 
because neither of you speak Chinese. The waiters give you really bad 
service, and you don't get any specials.
Third date: It doesn't work out, cause you're not Asian enough and she goes 
back out with some white guy she dated 5 years ago.  Eventually they get 
married and the Asian population diminishes! Or she decides she's a lesbian 
and goes out with some really Bohemian white chick that's into alternative 
music. and ends up fighting for some social cause for the rest of her life.



You marry an Asian girl and wonder what ever happened to your 
life...Or...money!!

Tracy, thanks for the heads up.  Beginning in January of 2000, provide me 
with the new and old serial numbers for each unit and a closer exchange date, 
as things (scheduling, changeout activities etc.) tend to move dates around.

To Market Participants

The official change from the 'Old' website to the 'New'
website will occur at 10:00 AM May 8.  We expect the
change to take about 10 minutes to complete.  The change
will only affect the public portion of the website and should
be transparent to most users.

If you are on the public website at the time of the switch, you
may need to reload/refresh the page you are viewing.  Also,
if you are downloading public data directly or through a script file,
errors may occur.  Simply reinitialize the download to correct
any errors that may have occurred.

If after about 10:10, 10:15 AM you are still experiencing difficulties,
please contact your Customer Relations Representative
or call 1-518-356-6060.

Thank You
The Website Refresh Team

George, Dave Cobrain of the NMED has verbally approved of the soil 
characterization work plan which you submitted to him for review and has said 
that we can begin work as soon as the plan is approved by the OCD.  I have 
not heard from Bill Olson of the OCD yet.  Dave was going to inform the OCD 
that their office has given approval of the plan and that this might expidite 
Bill's review process.  Ill let you know when I hear from the OCD.

Kenny, as you may know, there were 9 environmental applications submitted
to various local, state, and regional agencies requesting approval to
initiate this project and most of the requests apply to crossing the bypass
channel.   As of today, we have received one approval, and that from the
State Fire Marshall, Office of Pipeline Safety granting us a waiver so that
we can lay the pipe above ground as opposed to below ground.  I have calls
into  the other agencies  for which applications and requests were
submitted but have had no reply.  I would caution that we might get into
trouble for initiating a construction project without consent and approval
from a particular agency, as agencies many times look at an entire project
even though their jurisdiction may only apply in one specific area of a
project.  This is particularily the case in air permitting where an
applicant can not even construct a road or bring in construction materials
until the air permit is issued.  Because this is my first project in
California, Id like to be sure of this and make follow up calls to all
agencies for which applications and requests were submitted and verify that
we can initiate the construction, as long as we dont impact a specific  or
strategic portion (ie  the bypass channel)  for sometime down the road when
we are well into the project.   Ill call you tomorrow and let you
know.......

Subject:  Rogas Pipelines


We are going to start the Rogas project Monday 03/12/2001. The first 2500
ft leaving Rogas is across a carrot field that has been harvested and is
not in any habitat. The farmer is due to start working the field the 24th
so we need to get the pipe laid. The contractor is going to start with a
reduced crew and expects to be finished crossing the initial 2500 ft by the
end of the week. The following things must be accomplished early next week
so we can continue construction.

Checks received so we can purchase compensation credits from Kern Water
Bank and Area.

Be added to the KWB's Master Permit. That will happen when they receive
there check.

Insurance certificates in the hands of the Kern County Water Agency and
West Kern Water.

If the contractor has to stop we may be faced with additional mobilization
and demobilization charges.

On Wednesday, October 20th, I contacted Ms. Barbara Bernacik at the Office of 
the Pueblo of Laguna, Division of Environment. I contacted Ms. Bernacik at 
the suggestion of Norm Gonzales (TW Laguna Team) to discuss outstanding 
environmental issues at the Station. 

In a conversation with Norm the previous week, Norm indicated to me that he 
had met with Ms. Bernacik and Ray Lucero (Engineer, Pueblo of Laguna) 
recently in regards to backfilling an open excavation which had been 
excavated in 1993 when a diesel UST was removed from the site. The excavation 
had not been backfilled pending authorization from the Pueblo of Laguna. This 
and other outstanding issues were discussed in a meeting with Ray Lucero, the 
Governor of the Pueblo of Laguna, Ted Ryther, Larry Campbell, Butch Russell, 
and myself back in 1995 but there was no resolution of the issues, primarily 
because at the time the Laguna's did not have an environmental staff person 
to address such issues. Subsequently, Ms. Bernacik was hired as the Laguna's 
environmental staff person about two years ago. 

In the course of Norm's conversation with Ms. Bernacik and Mr. Lucero, Mr. 
Lucero indicated some concern that the Pueblo of Laguna had not been kept 
apprised of environmental issues at the Station. In light of this, I have 
prepared a "Report of Groundwater Monitoring Activities". This report covers 
monitoring activities between June 1994 and June 1999. As previously 
mentioned, I also contacted Ms. Bernacik for the purpose of introducing 
myself and to inform her that a report has been prepared and will be 
delivered to her office. I also suggested that we meet at the site to discuss 
outstanding environmental issues. The response from Ms. Bernacik was very 
favorable and we agreed to meet at the site at 10:00 am November 16th. Ms. 
Bernacik also indicated that someone from the BIA will be with her.

Take a look at what is going on in California (this may or may not relate to 
how badly PG&E needs natural gas).  John

Pollution Rules Tighten Squeeze on Power Supply 


By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer 


???? SACRAMENTO--California's already severe electricity squeeze could 
tighten further this summer if regulators don't ease up on air pollution 
rules, power company officials said Friday. 
???? The state's 1,000 power plants--many aging and burning natural 
gas--have been running so hard and long in this summer of electricity 
scarcity that many are close to spewing as much pollution as they are 
allowed for the year under their permits. 
???? Without flexibility from air pollution regulators, the plants could 
be forced to shut down or face fines. This summer California cannot 
afford the loss of any of those plants at times of peak demand, said the 
state's last-resort buyer of electricity. 
???? "I can't tell you whether we are in big trouble or medium trouble," 
said Terry Winter, who oversees the nonprofit agency that buys 
last-minute supplies when electricity consumption spikes so high that it 
threatens to disrupt the state's high-voltage grid. 
???? "If it stays really hot and we've got to run every unit," said 
Winter, "then we've got a problem. If it cools off a little bit, we 
could turn off those units exceeding their permits and we won't have a 
problem at all. My sense is, by late August we'll be seeing the problem 
more severely. But we're working on it." 
???? Local and state air pollution regulators say they recognize the 
problem and will do their best to help avoid outages. 
???? "I was flying by the seat of my pants," said Richard Baldwin, head 
of the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District, who hurriedly 
struck a deal last week to keep a gas-fired turbine running on the 
Ventura County coast. The plant, which would have otherwise been shut 
down for the rest of the year because of air pollution rules, is owned 
by Houston-based Reliant Energy, one of the major players in 
California's recently deregulated electricity market. 
???? Under the deal, Reliant will pay the air district $4,000 for every 
hour it runs the relatively dirty plant the rest of the year. The money 
will go toward replacement of heavily polluting diesel engines. 
???? The agreement means that California's grid operators can now count 
on the plant to produce enough electricity to supply 125,000 homes. On a 
hot day in late July they desperately needed that electricity, but could 
not get it because Reliant's air pollution permit allowed 100 hours of 
operation each year and only five remained. 
???? "Those air quality districts could just throw up their hands and 
say no, not our problem," said Winter, executive director of the 
California Independent System Operator, the nonprofit entity that runs 
most of California's electric grid, "but they have all been very 
responsive." 
???? He said his Folsom-based staff foresaw the problem and has been 
talking with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the California 
Air Resources Board and the local air districts that set pollution 
limits for individual power plants. 
???? "They have been very, very cooperative in trying to figure out ways 
to allow us to continue to generate but at the same time not add more 
pollutants to the air," he said. One way to do that, Winter said, may be 
to not run power plants in the evenings, when demand dips. 
???? "We don't want to put the lights out in the state," said Bill 
Kelly, spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District, 
which issued a letter to power producers two weeks ago warning that many 
will soon bump against their air pollution limits. 
???? "We asked them, if they're going to be above their caps, to come in 
and work with us on compliance plans," Kelly said. "These plans would be 
developed through public hearings." 
???? What can be done will vary with every plant in the state, said V. 
John White, who sits on the Cal-ISO board and directs the Center for 
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies in Sacramento. 
???? Air quality will not suffer significantly, White said, "with some 
creative application of rules and the principle that you've got to pay 
for the pollution somehow." 
???? The root of the current conflict between air pollution and energy 
production lies with California's failure in the last 10 years to build 
any major power plants. Demand for electricity in the state's humming 
economy has soared higher than anyone anticipated, while new supplies 
are not expected to reach the grid for at least a year. 
???? Several times this summer, grid operators have had to frantically 
purchase electricity elsewhere in the West to save the state from 
outages that can endanger lives and cost high-tech companies as much as 
$30 million a day in lost production. 
???? The shortage of electricity compromises air quality. When 
businesses voluntarily disconnect from the grid at times of highest 
demand, they often turn on diesel generators to maintain computer and 
phone systems. Such generators spew toxic air contaminants, particulates 
and higher levels of nitrogen oxides than most power plants. 
???? The tight supplies this summer also mean that California's old, 
inefficient power plants are running harder than ever and those built 
just for backup are running steadily. 
???? Duke Energy's power plant in Oakland helped keep lights on in the 
city after a disastrous 1989 earthquake. Typically, the costly plant 
operated 30 to 50 hours a year; its air pollution permit allows no more 
than 870 hours annually. So far this year, said Duke spokesman Tom 
Williams, the plant has run more than 500 hours. 
???? "The turbines date to late 1970s," he said. "They're being called 
on more and more." 
???? North Carolina-based Duke purchased or leased several major power 
plants from utilities such as Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and San Diego 
Gas & Electric after the Legislature deregulated the state's electricity 
market in 1996. 
???? One plant, in Chula Vista, generates enough electricity for 700,000 
homes in San Diego, where transmission problems leave the city 
especially vulnerable to power sags and surges. 
???? That plant is rapidly approaching its limit on nitrogen oxide 
pollutants, Williams said. "We're evaluating our options about how to 
address this problem."

Approval was received from the Texas Railroad Commission to discontinue 
groundwater monitoring at the Pucket Plant.  As you may remember, 
Transwestern constructed a permitted landfill to dispose of the entire 
facility near Ft. Stockton.  Groundwater montioring activities have been 
ongoing since aprox. 1988.  A permit condition states that if three years of 
groundwater sampling data confirms that the groundwater protection standard 
has not been exceeded, the groundwater monitoring activities can be 
terminated.  A letter from Leslie Savage granting this approval was received 
on July 14, 1999.  

Ken Gray, all other conditions of the permit are still in effect (noxious 
weed and mesquite control, monthly site inspections recordkeeping etc.....).  
Continue to keep the records accurate and up to date.  I anticipate that we 
will be required to monitor  and conduct housekeeping activities at the site 
indefinately.

A records review training was given to the Carlsbad Team.   Files were 
established and purged of historic and non applicable documents.

A check in the amount of $5,250.00 was delivered to the TNRCC for the late 
annual certifications required under the Title V air permit program.

All dehys in Albuquerque region were entered into the GRI GLYCALC software to 
determine applicability to the O&G MACT standard.  Preliminary determinations 
indicate that no dehys will not be subject to the  new rule. 

An inspection was conducted of the Transwestern Pipeline Keystone C/S 
landfarm by the Railroad Commission of Texas.  The inspection went well and 
no deficiencies ro violations were identified by the agency.

Title V air permit for the two Arizona C/S's (Leupp and Klagetoh) which are 
on the Navajo Indian reservation were issued by the USEPA.  The permits seem 
to be very lenient in terms of requirements.  Meetings have been scheduled 
with each field team to assign roles and responsibilities to ensure 
complaince with each permit.

Subject: Price Corrections for the 16 November 2000 Day-Ahead Market



PSEG shares the concerns that have been raised on this tie list concerning
the price correction to the November 16 DAM market.  In addition to clearly
explaining exactly what happened, we request the ISO address the following
issues at the November 30 BIC meeting:

1.  How, if this was an error, did it get so far into the SCUC process -
especially given the impact it had on system prices?
2.  Explaining exactly what authority the ISO is acting under in eliminating
the "problem" bid.
3.  Defining the time frame of all actions taken involving this transaction
(i.e., will you provide participants with a time-line from beginning to end
with these transactions)
4.  Outlining the security issues that will be taken to insure the data
integrity and time stamps associated with all levels of this transaction,
including MIS data and correspondence between the participant and the ISO.
5.  Assuring the market participants that the financial implications and
credit restrictions on the bidding entity were NOT the driving force behind
changing prices (the impact of this could bankrupt certain market
participants - we want to know that this is not a concern the ISO is
addressing).
6.  In Jim's notification he states:  "The NYISO experienced software
anomalies with respect to the submission of these transactions that may have
contributed to the difficulties experienced in confirming the initial bids."
The word "may" in this statement infers there may be a doubt that there was
a direct connection between the software problem and the bids.   Will you be
committing in this meeting to exactly what caused the problem?

Ray

Larry-

Water Disposal:  The current rate of water production has been established as 
a compromise between what we think is most effective for removing PSH and 
what we think are reasonable disposal costs. Our objective is to flush out 
PSH that is trapped in dissolution channels and fractures in the aquifer. 
Dewatering is not an objective because the shallow aquifer is too prolific a 
producer. In an effort to flush out trapped PSH we pump 200 bbls of 
groundwater twice weekly (or 1600 bbl per month). In addition we manually 
remove any accumulated PSH from recovery wells that do not have pumps in 
them. Pumping 200 bbls per cycle takes about 24 hours and is adequate to 
create a significant drawdown of the aquifer in the immediate vicinity of the 
former pit area. The aquifer will recharge within 24 hours, but we don't 
start another cycle until after about 60 hours in order to limit the number 
of cycles to two per week. The number of cycles is limited to two per week 
primarily for cost considerations, but also because our minor permit 
specifies a maximum disposal rate of 400 bbl per week. If we were to limit 
the number of cycles to one per week we would drop our PSH removal efficiency 
by nearly 50%; likewise, if we were to increase the number of cycles to four 
per week we would increase our removal efficiency by nearly 100%. Note that 
beyond about four cycles per week, there will be a deminishing advantage to 
increasing the number of cycles due to the time it takes to draw down the 
aquifer and the time it takes for the aquifer to recharge. Cycling the pumps 
twice per week also fits well into our O&M schedule for other sites in the 
area. We are spending about $3,200 per month for O&M at this site, about 
$1,800 per month on water disposal and $1,400 for O&M labor. These costs are 
directly proportional to the number of cycles per week that we operate the 
pumps. In regard to the effectiveness of this scheme, we have seen some 
positive indications in both a reduction of accumulated PSH in the former pit 
area recovery wells and a decrease in dissolved phase contaminants at monitor 
wells downgradient from the former pit area. An exception to this is the 
accumulation of PSH from what appears to be another source located west of 
the former pit area. This issue is being addressed by the installation of 
additional recovery wells. Another note regarding water disposal, we had 
briefly discussed the possibility of irrigating produced water rather than 
hauling it. We temporarily dismissed this idea over concern that arsenic 
contained in groundwater might accumulate in surface soil as a result of 
irrigation. We should revisit this idea next spring if it appears that 
pumping will continue much longer.

Monitor Wells:  Although the additional wells that we have planned should 
adequately delineate the dissolved phase plume, I am reluctant to think that 
these will be the last. The TRC recently rejected closure requests for about 
a half-dozen ENA sites. In a recent meeting between the TRC and David Ayers 
(for ENA), the TRC requested that ENA return to the sites and delineate 
dissolved phase contaminant plumes to MCL concentrations. Although the TRC 
has not yet made that request for this site, it is certainly a possibility. 
This is also consistent with recent draft guidance documents prepared by the 
TRC that specifies plume delineation to MCL concentrations. Currently, 
arsenic is the only contaminant in groundwater that is not delineated to MCL 
concentrations, more specifically, downgradient and east of the release area. 
We will have to wait and see what results we get from the new wells before we 
have a better idea whether any additional wells may someday be required. 

Recovery Wells:  This is totally dependent on what we find with the 
additional recovery wells. I suspect that we are going to confirm a separate 
source of PSH and will require additional wells to adequately remove PSH.

George, Ive read through your stuff on the Gomez remediation and need some 
help.  Why are we collecting so much groundwater.  Im concerned that charges 
for twice weekly disposal may be perceived as excessive, even though the 
costs are reasonable.  Are we trying to dewater or what?  Other than that, I 
dont mind ensuring the protection of the upstream spring and think we should 
get busy on the well installations.  Do you think this will do it with 
respect to no more wells needed.  Id like to get to that position as quickly 
as possible.

After the telephone conference call we had on 9/17, I contacted the Roger 
Kohn permit engineer with EPA about a possible meeting with his agency to 
resolve and assist the issuance of the air permits for stations 3 and 4.  His 
message back to me was a reiteration of the last request I made to him, that 
he could see no way that Transwestern would be able to help the EPA in this 
matter.  We discussed the possibility of Transwestern contacting his 
supervisor, Gerardo Rios, about a potential meeting and he indicated that we 
could choose this avenue if we desired. 

Gerardo's telephone number is 415-744-1259.

Midland Team, the Martin Co. No. 1 facility is potentially in non compliance 
because there is new emissions data from the EPA which shows the units at 
this facility  emit emissions which would trigger a Title V air permit.  
Steve San Miguel and Stoney tried to conduct an emissions test  with a 
portable analyzer but were unable to collect representative emissions data 
due to the fact that the unit was in very poor mechanical shape and showed 
very high emissions.  We have a couple of options.  Spend the $$$$ necessary 
to bring the unit up to standards that allow a representative emissions test 
to be conducted and determine whether the emissions from the units trigger 
permit action or use the new EPA data and submit an air permit application.  
The choice is yours.  Understand, this permit if issued, places some 
recordkeeping and mechanical responsibilities on the Midland team.  Let me 
know what you would like to do.

Larry, you need to direct this to them also, they dont seem to be to worried. 
I have asked them several times of the status of the work that needed to be 
performed but have not gotten to far. I think it would benifit us both if you 
would tag the Director and advisor for them to help me with this.

Thanks, Stoney

Privileged & Confidential 
Attorney - Client Communication

I just spoke with Mr. Charles de Saillan, Asst. General Counsel for the NMED, 
concerning the referenced Compliance Order.  Apparently the NMED mailed out 
60 of these orders last week.  The NM legislature has adopted a statute of 
limitations under the NM Air Quality Act and the NMED was acting to attempt 
to foreclose the use of this defense.  (Dave - can Mary hunt this new 
legislation down??).

The language in the order assessing a $15,000 penalty per day of violation is 
standard language when the NMED has not assessed a specific figure.  It will 
be a couple of weeks before the NMED will be able to provide us a specific 
penalty.  We discussed settlement and the administrative hearing process.  A 
settlement meeting is not likely to take place soon due to the NMED's 
workload.  We need to have a number from the NMED before the settlement 
conference anyway. We will have to file the request to go to hearing no later 
tahn July 18th.  However, Charlie stated that if the respondent evidenced 
good faith to achieve as settlement the Secretary had the discretion to allow 
additional time to submit a full answer (where we provided all of the details 
of our defense.)

I told Charlie we would be organizing ourselves internally and that we would 
get back to him with some proposed dates for a settlement conference, a 
request for hearing and a request to extend the time in which to file an 
answer - preferably tied to after the settlement conference.

Let's see about dates and Dave or I will call the NMED and submit a letter 
with the three items above.  We want to make sure that the NMED has time 
before the end of the 30 day period to respond to our request for an 
extension on the answer.

Larry, 

During the past week I have completed the following activities on the Rogas  
project: 

1) Started the preactivity survey for the Rogas pipeline project - we have  
completed from the Rogas railcar facility west to Enos Lane and south along  
Enos Lane to the large KWB canal (at the point where the route turns west). 
I  
have also reviewed a proposed materials and equipment storage area at Kenny  
Maltby's request. 

2) I have continued to try to contact Jeff Single at CDFG regarding the  
project...he was out most of last week and this week and will return  
Thursday, March 1. 

3) Coordinated with Scott Jones, Kenny Maltby, and Jeff Turpin (?, I believe  
a consultant that Scott is working with) regarding compensation credit  
purchase. I basically have provided explanations of terminology and answered  
questions, to the extent of my knowledge. This has included input regarding  
the ~41 credits that EOTT will have the right to use at Coles Levee once  
paperwork is completed with CDFG. 

Other activity: 

1) 2-22 sent draft annual reports for EOTT 2081 permit for 1999 and 2000. 

Plans for the remainder of this week: 

1) Complete preactivity survey on Kern Water Bank (including route 
adjustment  
for SCE). Coles Levee preactivity survey will be completed during the first  
part of next week. Subsequent to preactivity surveys and approvals from  
property owners, agencies, and EOTT, we will begin implementation of  
mitigation measures (trapping where necessary etc.).  

2) Continue to attempt contact with Jeff Single to assist with getting  
approval to AERA for compensation credit paperwork. 

3) Coordinate and assist as needed. 

Please call or e-mail if you have any questions. I understand that you are  
having a meeting set-up with Jeff Single at CDFG. Please let me know if you  
would like me to attend or help in any way.

Subject: New Options Model

Meeting on May 30 at 3:30pm regarding the new Option Model we (Steve Wang, 
Harry Arora, and Rob Stalford) use to make markets.  The old structuring 
model was created for marketer to give indicative pricing.  I have created 
this model especially for option market making.  As market makers we found 
the old model too slow as we are often making bid/offers in more than five 
strikes in more than five different months.  This model allows us to make our 
markets quicker and identify mispricings in the market before our 
competitors.  This is not to replace the old structuring model.  It is only a 
complement that will give everyone a better picture of where options are 
trading and where bid/offers are.  We will publish these prices weekly and 
will eventually have them on a daily basis.

M:\power2\Options.  Let me know if you want access to this folder.  The

This is a message from Kerry. 

I just converted and moved Larry Campbell (lcampbe) to the W2K server.  He 
uses ESIS.  I successfully converted the tables and have the links corrected 
(logged in as kgramse), however Larry cannot use the system.  I received a 
message while logged in as Larry stating that the data/application was 
"Read-Only" when I attempted to re-link the tables.  

Please check the permissions on GTROS-FS01P\APPSRW 

Thanks,

Kerry

consequence of his/her employment with Enron.  Further, Enron's Business=20
Ethics Policy states that no lavish entertainment or gifts are to be given =

 Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but you=

cooperation in respecting these standards is also critical.  Enron expects=

Meeting Planning Team,
This like it is on target at this point.  You should probably circulate the
draft to Pribble, after you are comfortable with it, to get his preliminary
buy-in.  Now, I do have a few questions.  Is someone talking with the
Little America Hotel in Flagstaff and blocking out enough rooms for our
meeting?  When can we get some preliminary dates (How about the week of
April 22, 2002?)???   If that week is not good, then go to the second week
in May as I will have serious conflicts with the first week of May.  Also,
who will be in charge of planning the evening dinners?  I would like to
talk with that person as I have a couple of "fun" ideas to offer about
where we might go for dinner.  Thanks to both the North Safety Team and the
SW Environmental Team for taking a lead role in this.  John

Here are some comments that I provided to UPSCO Inc.? Note that the price is 
$375 per kit.? UPSCO is the service firm in New York state that asked Dow to 
reformulate an insulation polyurethane foam product that they marketed.? The 
new product had a pressure of up to 260 psi and a retarded set time.? Both 
factors allowed better fill of pipe being abandoned.? Dow and UPSCO seem to 
have partnered on this product.

In addition, here is the MSDS for the product.? The exposure of employees is 
negligible, however, since there are tight fitting connections to the pipe 
being filled.

Attached is also a photo of nozzles used.

Dan, I have copied your questions and have responded in capital letters.? 
Please realize that this is my reaction as of today, and that may change as 
we gain experience with the Froth Paks.

Did we meet your expectations?? 

YES.? YOU MET MY EXPECTATIONS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOUR PRODUCT.? MY 
EXPECTATIONS WERE INFLUENCED BY THE POSITIVE DEMONSTRATION THAT I OBSERVED IN 
ALBANY.? WHAT I WANTED TO ASSESS WAS ACTUAL USE IN THE FIELD, THE NECESSITY 
TO HAVE A TIGHT FITTING CONNECTION TO THE SERVICE AND WHETHER THAT WAS A 
SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO USING THIS PRODUCT, THE TIME REQUIRED TO SET UP, AND 
THE OVERALL REACTION OF OPERATING MANAGEMENT AND FIELD CREWS.? THE REACTION 
TO THE PRODUCT WAS VERY POSITIVE.

Do we have any challenges that need to be addressed?? 

1.????? COST IS A BIG ONE.? IF WE CAN FILL 10 SERVICES (I BELIEVE THAT THIS 
WAS JOHN CAHILL'S GUESS FOR 50 FOOT SERVICES) PER FROTH PAK AT A COST OF 
$375, THAT HAS A UNIT ABANDONMENT COST OF $37.50 COMPARED WITH THE $5 WE ARE 
SPENDING FOR AN AEROSOL CAN.? CLEARLY THE FROTH PAK FILLS THE SERVICES OVER 
LONGER DISTANCES, CONSISTENTLY, RAPIDLY, AND MORE RELIABLY.? AS JOHN CAHILL 
AND I DISCUSSED, INCREASED SALES WILL BRING THE COST DOWN.? 

??????? -- IT MAY BE PREMATURE, BUT WHAT IS YOUR ESTIMATE OF HOW COST MAY 
VARY WITH INCREASED DEMAND?? 
??????? -- HOW MANY UNITS DO YOU HAVE TO SELL TO TRIGGER A SIGNIFICANT 
REDUCTION IS PRICE?? 
??????? -- THERE WAS AN INDICATION THAT PALLETS OF 30 WOULD HAVE A QUANTITY 
DISCOUNT, BUT WHAT IS THAT DISCOUNTED PRICE OF A PALLET?

THERE MAY BE A MIDDLE GROUND FOR US OF USING CANS FOR CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES 
AND THE FROTH PAK FOR OTHERS.? 

THE TWO PAKS THAT WERE LEFT FOR OUR USE WILL PROVIDE US SOME USEFUL HANDS-ON 
EVALUATION OPPORTUNITIES. 

2.????? SHELF-LIFE AFTER THE CYLINDERS ARE OPENED.? THE 45-DAY LIFE MAY NOT 
ALLOW US TO EFFICIENTLY USE UP REAGENTS.? WE ARE A LARGE TERRITORY COMPANY.? 
SHARING OF PAKS BETWEEN DISTRICTS WOULD MEAN TRAVEL TIME TO TAKE KITS FROM 
DISTRICT TO DISTRICT.? ON THE OTHER HAND, INDIVIDUAL PAKS FOR EACH DISTRICT 
MAY MEAN GREATER WASTED REAGENTS.

Where do we go from here?? 

FOR OUR COMPANY, THE FIRST STEP IS TO DEVELOP A SURVEY FORM THAT WE WILL USE 
FOR THE CREWS.? (THE DRAFT FORM IS UNDER REVIEW.)? WE WILL BE ABLE TO TALLY 
SUCCESSES UNDER VARYING CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE REACTION OF THE FIELD CREWS, AS 
WELL AS IDENTIFYING ANY PROBLEM SITUATIONS.? WE WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP 
THE AVERAGE COST PER SERVICE.? THE TWO KITS WILL BE USED IN TWO DIFFERENT 
REGIONS, AND THE INFORMATION/EXPERIENCE WILL BE EXAMINED TO SEE IF THERE WERE 
ANY PROBLEMS.? COSTS WILL BE CALCULATED.? THEN WE WILL DECIDE WHETHER WE NEED 
TO PILOT THIS SOME MORE, OR WE WOULD PREFER TO STAY WITH OUR PRESENT METHODS, 
OR IF WE WISH TO IMPLEMENT USE OF YOUR PRODUCT FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS.

JOHN CAHILL WILL BE PROVIDING US INFORMATION REGARDING LANDFILLING APPROVAL 
FOR PRODUCT FOAM AND DEPLETED REAGENT PRESSURE CONTAINERS.? 

ANDY BOOS WILL BE PROVIDING ADDITIONAL NOZZLE/CONNECTORS TO CAREY DOWNS, 
BECAUSE OF THE SHORTER AVERAGE LENGTH ABANDONMENTS IN HIS REGION.

One of the thoughts that we are currently evaluating and would greatly 
appreciate your input on is the following:? Based upon all of our field work 
we believe that it may be advantageous to under fill the cylinders of 
chemical (180 board feet to 110-120) and in turn increase the amount of 
propellant from 250 psi to 350 psi.? In our opinion this would serve three 
functions: 1) Reduce potential material waste; 2) Reduce any potential 
confusion associated with using a 

kit multiple times; 3) Reduce the cost per foot factors and the acquisition 
price.? What do you think? 

1.????? THIS APPROACH WOULD ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS ABOUT WASTED REAGENT.? 
2.????? FOR USING THE KIT AT MULTIPLE LOCATIONS, THERE IS PROBABLY A NEED TO 
TRACK HOW MANY ABANDONMENTS OF WHAT DIAMETER AND LENGTH IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE 
HOW MANY ADDITIONAL LINES YOU CAN FILL.? TOWARD THE END OF A KIT, THERE IS A 
QUESTION OF WHETHER YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO FILL A LINE OR NOT.? CAN YOU SWITCH 
PAKS WHEN ONE RUNS OUT, IF YOU DO IT WITHIN 2 MINUTES OF THE INJECTION START 
TIME OF THE FIRST KIT?? OTHERWISE THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH RUNNING OUT OF 
REACTANTS WHEN YOU'VE SQUIRTED IN LESS THAN ENOUGH FOR 50% OF THE VOLUME.? 
THERE IS ALSO A PROBLEM WITH DECIDING WHAT PERCENTAGE YOU HAVE FILLED WHEN 
YOU RUN OUT.

3.????? IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE COST PER FOOT WOULD GO UP WITH UNDERFILLED 
CYLINDERS, SINCE THE FIXED COST IS THE SAME FOR CYLINDERS, HOSES, TRIGGER, 
AND CARDBOARD BOX.? YOU WOULD STILL GET THE SAME NUMBER OF BOXES ON A PALLET, 
BUT YOU'D FILL FEWER LINES WITH THAT PALLET.

FEWER FILLS AND CHEAPER PAKS WOULD, HOWEVER, ALLOW US TO PURCHASE MORE AND 
DISTRIBUTE THEM MORE WIDELY.? THAT WOULD CUT DOWN ON THE TRAVEL TIME TO 
DELIVER SHARED PAKS.

I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR WHAT THE FEEDBACK IS FROM THE OPERATING REGIONS AFTER 
THEY PILOT THE PAKS BEFORE WE GIVE YOU OUR MEASURED OPINION ON THE UNDERFILL 
CONCEPT.

THAT'S ALL OF MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT REACTION FOR NOW.? THANKS FOR THE 
EVALUATION OPPORTUNITY.

Ralph, 

Good morning. The boys made it back safe and sound with glowing reports of 
yesterdays' foam demonstration.? I am curious as to your thoughts.? Did we 
meet your expectations?? Do we have any challenges that need to be 
addressed?? Where do we go from here?? One of the thoughts that we are

following:? Based upon all of our field work we believe that it may be

solution for Gas Utilities to effectively and economically address the Mega 
Rule. If you have any photos from yesterday that you can pass along I would 
appreciate seeing them.? DP

I called Ms. Bernacik this afternoon regarding several issues. 
1.)  Ms. Bernacik indicated that the POEP has formed a Superfund division 
which is lead by a fellow named Mr. Rizvi. Mr. Rizvi had contacted Ms. 
Bernacik and requested the opportunity to be present at the site during the 
next semiannual sampling event. This event is tentatively scheduled for the 
week of June 19th. I am to notify Ms. Bernacik when we have set a firm date 
for sampling. 
2.)  Ms. Bernacik asked if we had received an extension to the off-site 
access permit from the Pueblo so that we could install the three additional 
wells. I indicated that I believe the extension was issued and Norm had 
picked it up but I wasn't certain. I followed-up with Norm and he has picked 
up the permit. Drilling activities are scheduled for the week of June 5th.
3.)  I asked Ms. Bernacik about our request for no further action on the UST 
removal. Ms. Bernacik indicated that Norm Moreno at the POEP had responded to 
her with comments on the request and recommended against closing the issue. 
Ms. Bernacik said that she would send us a copy of Mr. Moreno's letter. At a 
minimum, the Pueblo will require continued monitoring. This does not change 
our monitoring plan since we had already proposed continued monitoring of the 
UST area wells as part of our facility wide groundwater monitoring program. 
However, Ms. Bernacik also indicated that the Pueblo may require one or two 
additional monitor wells in the former UST area.
4.)  I asked Ms. Bernacik about backfilling the former UST excavation area. 
Ms. Bernacik indicated that her office had already issued an approval of TW's 
request to close the landfarm. I asked again about backfilling the excavation 
but was having difficulty communicating my interest was backfilling the 
excavation rather than closure of the landfarm. I reviewed the letter from 
Ms. Bernacik regarding closure of the landfarm and it does not specifically 
address backfilling the excavation. I believe that Ms. Bernacik is under the 
impression that her office has already approved backfilling the excavation, 
if we still want to get this in writing, it may be best for Norm to visit 
with Ms. Bernacik at her office in order to better explain what we need.

 1) press 0# twice in order to bypass the voice menu and connect to an 
operator.
 2) tell them you need to wire funds.


Datek  
http://www.datek.com/popinframe.html?ref=/helpdesk/index.html&navNumber=3

 This link has all the info you need.
 On the left side of the page, click "Helpdesk" then "Managing funds".
 Scroll down to the heading, "Wire Instructions for Transfer of Funds to

 Have this page up while you talk with the bank operator because she will 
need the info off this page.

As you are aware, your business unit has been selected to participate in 
Project GEM (Global Enron Migration) for the rollout of Windows 2000.  In 
preparation for this rollout, it is imperative that we gather information 
about your workstation and the applications you use.  To begin this data 
collection, we have automated the process.  In fact, your system has just 
been inventoried.   Once this information is received, we will be working 
with your local department coordinator to consolidate this information to 
ensure this transition is as smooth as possible.

The GEM team would like to thank you for your participation.  If you have any 
questions, please contact Jose Favela at (713)345-5878.

Mike Riedel attended an API Workshop recently that included EPA presenters. 
EPA has changed their interpretation of the E& P, T & S MACT regulations that 
would have an impact on the registrations required in June of this year. The 
API representatives apparently agreed with the EPA interpretations. The 
Environmental Notice on the intranet will be changed to reflect these 
changes. 

Dehys  that are Major Sources for HAPs must be registered with EPA on June 
17, 2000. Previously it was understood that your Major Source status on June 
17, 2000 would determine if you register a facility. EPA has indicated that 
your status on June 17, 1999 would determine whether or not a site is 
registered.

For dehys regulated under the E & P MACT regulations (this does not impact 
the T & S MACT), you determine your major source status by first determining 
if the dehys at a location exceed 10 tons/year of any one HAP or 25 tons/year 
of all HAPs. If they do you must register the location with EPA. If not a 
Major Source because of dehys, you must then determine the HAP emissions from 
the greatest non-dehy source of HAP emissions (typically a recip engine). If 
the HAP emissions from this source alone exceed 10/25 tons/year, the location 
must be registered with EPA. If not you do not need to register. You no 
longer need to determine HAP emissions from the entire site to determine 
Major Source status.

If you have any questions, give me call at 713-646-7646.

Marc

Dear Larry:
 We are currently completing the improved modeling to include the
effect of flow regimes, which I am sure that you recall that in our meeting
the last time, we agreed that this will be a major influence on both the
quantity of solvent and time required to clean it up. It is probably the
most important modification to the model. It has been a major efforts. We
hope to complete this part by June 20th. Then we will perform the rigorous
model testing.  With the continuous testing we have done on every module
independently, I do not expect us to run into any major difficulty, hence I
expect that to be done in one week to 10 days. We will then begin to conduct
parametric runs for the TW system. We will analyze the results and come up
with a summary of what it means and how that will affect economics, etc. So,
with all these, I will be able to prepare a comprehensive progress report by
July 15th. I hope that this schedule meets your approval.
 The flow regime & time-of-contact work is something that we did not
anticipate originally but which came up in the course of the review that
you, John and Tiny had with us at Penn State. I believe that it is really
important as some of the initial results are showing. So, I am grateful for
your input. It has taken a little more time (perhaps more than little) to do
it but we are very very close to completing this part. I believe that it
would be worth the effort.
 I have been told by the Office of Research that our current contract
expires at the end of the month unless you sign the "no-cost" extension.
This document should have reached your desk according to them. I am not sure
that you'd recall; we have been able to conserve funds on the project
because I have 2 of the students (they are from Venezuela) working on the
project being sponsored by their own Govt. and hence we have not paid them
from the project. I would appreciate your prompt approval of the no-cost
extension of the contract so that the University would not stop us from
continuing. When I submit my comprehensive progress report in mid-July, I
suggest that we meet thereafter to discuss the results and direction and at
that point, it would be necessary to discuss the finance as well.
 I appreciate the support that I have received from all of you. I
look forward to hearing from you.
Best Regards,
Michael

Michael, I will be discussing with John and others in the near future about
the status of the study.  When will your progress report be ready for
review?  It might be a good idea to let us review your report and then we
can make comments and recommendations based upon your findings.  Im glad
that things are going well with your data and that we may be able to apply
something positive towards our situation.  Thanks for getting back with me.

Hi Larry:
     Sorry for the delayed response. I have just got back from an
overseas trip yesterday. I am in the process of preparing a progress report
for you. We have obtained some additional interesting results. I was also
waiting for input from your group. You may recall that at the end of our
Houston meeting, John told me that he would be getting back to me on some
specific directions from the group. I believe that we would be done with
the
major aspects of PCB work soon, then we would be focusing on arsenic.
Please
let me know of any thoughts and ideas. Thanks Larry.
     We are finally seeing the Spring here and maybe a short one for that
matter. Summer is just around the corner.
Best Regards,
Michael

Michael, I know its been some time since we communicated, but how is the
PCB pipeline modeling efforts going?   I would appreciate a  summary from
you identifying  recent discoveries and a general update on the project.

Have you thawed out from the Pennsylvania winter?

In its first week, the ThinkBank's Idea Vault received more than 35 ideas 
from all over the world!  And those ideas aren't just sitting there -- oh, 
no.  Connections have been made, dialogues have been started, things are 
happening at the ThinkBank.   
What's your interest rate?  Come to the ThinkBank today.


Did you ask a question at the all-employee meeting last month that was not 
answered?  Take a look in eMeet.  We've posted responses to questions from 
the meeting, as well as another anonymous question to the Office of the 
Chairman.  See the "Office of the Chairman" category in eMeet.


Stop by the eSpeak Archives to see what was discussed in Cindy Olson's 
EnronOptions event.  Great questions, great answers.  They're all in the 
transcript on eSpeak.

I just received a copy of this letter from Southwest Gas to Lee Stewart, 
President of SoCalGas' transmission business unit.? They are asking for PECO 
750H coalescing filters to be installed at to taps, and for SoCal to maintain 
them.

 <<swgas.PDF>> 

Are these the same filters that were used by PG&E?? Do you know what they 
cost?? Does Transwestern wish to become involved, or would you prefer to stay 
in the background?

Below is an update on the status of the grandfather legislation. Changes from 
previous versions include a 30% reduction for oil and gas facilities instead 
of 20% and an extension of the voluntary program until 9/2002 instead of 
9/2001. I asked Skip Dees if that meant TNRCC would allow companies to 
"authorize" grandfathered sources under old exemptions for a year longer and 
his response is below. His suggestion is to act now (as is mine). 


Skip's e-mail response: "If the Sunset Bill passes with the current 
grandfathered facility language (and there is no guarantee of that - it ain't 
gonna get any better, and it could get worse), we'd have till 9/1/02 to apply 
for a VERP-type permit with
10-year old BACT.  The deal on applying historical PBR's to grandfathered
facilities is a TNRCC letter interpretation, and that COULD change at any
time.  If that option works for you, I'd jump on it NOW."

		 Subject: Grandfathered Facilities - Endangered Species With No Prospects o f 
Protection


The days of grandfathered facilities in Texas are numbered.  This does not
only mean those large facilities in nonattainment areas, but ANY facility
that was constructed prior to September, 1971 and has not subsequently been
rolled into some sort of new source review (NSR) permit or Permit by Rule
(formerly Standard Exemption).  Note that proposed new rules recently
published in the Texas Register for public comment will require operators to
be able to produce documentation of applicability and compliance for all
facilities authorized by a Permit by Rule/Standard Exemption, much the same
as is required for any other type of permit.

The TNRCC Sunset Bill contains language limiting the time that such
facilities may operate without NSR authorization of some sort.  The Senate
Committee Substitute (SCS) for HB 2912 is a little stricter than the version
passed by the House, but both versions did contain grandfathered facility
permitting provisions and it is safe to assume that the final version will
also.  If this version passes, you will have one additional year to apply
for a Voluntary Emissions Reduction Permit (VERP).  If your facility is a
pipeline facility, the TNRCC will require no more than a 30% reduction in
NOx, and that reduction can be averaged for several facilities in the same
area covered in one permit.

Note that it is only through the efforts of our lobbyists - particularly
Cindy Morphew of TxOGA and Celina Romero of ATINGP - that it looks as though
we will get an additional opportunity to get these facilities permitted
without having to use today's BACT.

This memo summarizes the SCS provisions for your information.  This is NOT
actual bill language - I've TRIED to make it easier to read.

Note that these provisions may be changed somewhat if the House does not
concur in all of the changes made by the Senate and the bill goes to
Conference.  In addition, we expect a strong attempt to amend the bill on
the Senate floor to require shutdown on September 1, 2001 of grandfathered
facilities that do not have a pending permit application.  If that attempt
is successful, the opportunity to apply for a VERP will be gone on September
1.

The memo also recaps previous recommendations to you regarding the current
opportunity to claim historical Permits by Rule (Standard Exemptions) as a
means of permitting a grandfathered facility.  I am not certain how long
this opportunity will continue to exist.  TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT WHILE YOU
CAN.

In addition, I've appended some information on 10-year old BACT for
gas-fired IC engines and turbines that might be useful if you are trying to
get a VERP now.




PROVISIONS OF SCS FOR HB 2912 (PRIOR TO SENATE FLOOR DEBATE)

Sec. 382.05181.  PERMIT REQUIRED.

(a)  Any grandfathered facility that does not have an application pending
for a new source review permit or other authorization, other than a federal
operating permit, and that has not submitted a notice of shutdown as
provided in Section 382.05182 may not emit air contaminants on or after:

 (1)  September 1, 2003, if the facility is located in a
nonattainment area; or

 (2)  September 1, 2005, if the facility is located in an attainment
area.

(b)  Any grandfathered facility that does not have a permit or other
authorization under this chapter, other than a federal operating permit
permit, may not emit air contaminants on or after:

 (1)  September 1, 2005, if the facility is located in a
nonattainment area; or

 (2)  September 1, 2007, if the facility is located in an attainment
area.

(c)  Facilities eligible for a Small Business Stationary Source Permit are
subject to the permitting deadlines in Section 382.05184.

Sec. 382.05182.  NOTICE OF SHUTDOWN.

(a)  A notice of shutdown to allow operation of a grandfathered facility
beyond the deadlines of 382.05181(a) must be filed with the commission
before the applicable deadline.

(b)  A notice under this section shall include:

  (1)  the date the facility intends to cease operating;

  (2)  an inventory of the type and amount of emissions that
will be eliminated when the facility ceases to operate; and

  (3)  any other necessary and relevant information the
commission by rule deems appropriate.

GENERAL PROVISIONS (APPLICABLE TO PERMITS UNDER 382.05183, 382.05184, AND
382.05186)

(a)  The commission shall grant a permit under this section if, from the
information available to the commission, including information presented at
any public hearing or through written comment, the commission finds that
there is no indication that the emissions from the facility will contravene
the intent of this chapter, including protection of the public's health and
physical property.

(b)  If the commission finds that the emissions from the facility will not
comply with Subsection (c), the commission may not grant the permit under
this section.

(c)  A person planning the modification of a facility previously permitted
under this section must comply with new source permitting requirements
before modifying.

(d)  The commission may adopt rules as necessary to implement and administer
this section.

(e)  If an applicant omits any relevant facts or submits incorrect
information in an application, the applicant shall submit the relevant facts
or correct the information no later than 60 days after discovering the
error.  If while processing the application, the commission determines that
additional information is necessary to evaluate or to take final action on
the application, the commission may request the information and set a
reasonable deadline for a response.  Failure to comply with the deadline for
the response will result in the application being returned to the applicant.

Sec. 382.05183.  EXISTING FACILITY PERMIT.

(a)  The owner or operator of a grandfathered facility may apply for a
permit to operate the facility under this section.

(b)  The commission shall grant a permit under this section if, from the
information available to the commission, including information presented at
any public hearing or through written comment, the commission finds that the
application:

  (1)  is filed before September 1, 2002 and the facility will
use an air pollution control method at least as effective as 10-year old
BACT; or

  (2)  is filed before the applicable deadline of 382.05181(a)
and the facility will use current BACT.

(c)  The commission may issue an existing facility flexible permit for some
or all of the grandfathered facilities at a site.  Permits issued under this
subsection shall follow the same permit issuance, modification, and renewal
procedures as existing facility permits.

Sec. 382.05184.  SMALL BUSINESS STATIONARY SOURCE PERMIT.

(a)  Grandfathered facilities that are located at a small business
stationary source and are not required by commission rule to submit an
annual emissions inventory report may apply for a permit under this section
before September 1, 2005.

(b)  Grandfathered facilities that are located at a small business
stationary source that does not have an application pending for a new source
review permit or other authorization, other than a federal operating permit,
and that has not submitted a notice of shutdown, may not emit air
contaminants on or after September 1, 2007.

Sec.  382.05185.  ELECTRIC GENERATING FACILITY PERMIT.

Special provisions for permitting grandfathered electric generating
facilities are not outlined in this memo.

Sec. 382.05186.  AUTHORIZATION FOR PIPELINE FACILITIES.

(a)  The commission by rule shall establish the procedures for applications
for grandfathered processing, treating, compression, or pumping facilities
connected to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline.

(b)  Based on a prioritization by the commission as necessary to meet local,
regional, and statewide air quality needs related directly or indirectly to
federal air quality standards, the commission may require up to a 30%
reduction of the hourly emission rates of NOx and VOC from reciprocating
internal combustion engines subject to this section.  For facilities other
than reciprocating internal combustion engines that are connected to or part
of a gathering or transmission pipeline , the commission may consider
requiring hourly emissions rate reductions of up to 30% for NOx and 20% for
VOC.  The commission by rule may designate counties or regions of the state
where greater reductions in the hourly emission rate will be required than
in other areas, but no more than 30 percent reductions in the hourly rate
may be required in any area.

(c)  The commission shall:

  (1)  allow for a single permit for all facilities connected
to or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline;

  (2)  allow for required reductions for facilities under this
section to be achieved at one facility or averaged among more than one
facility and located in the same local, regional, or statewide areas
designated by the commission under Subsection (b);

  (3)  for purposes of emission averaging, allow emission
reductions achieved from grandfathered since September 1, 1997; and

  (4)  allow an owner or operator to apply for separate
permits under this section for discrete and separate facilities connected to
or part of a gathering or transmission pipeline.

(d)  Facilities authorized by this section shall be considered permitted
under this chapter.




CURRENT OPPORTUNITY TO CLAIM A PERMIT BY RULE TO "PERMIT" A GRANDFATHERED
FACILITY

TNRCC has interpreted its rules to allow operators to permit grandfathered
facilities using any applicable "Permit by Rule," including those previously
referred to as Standard Exemptions.

For instance, old Standard Exemption 7, effective May 8, 1972, was for "Gas
fired internal combustion engines of less than 2000 hp and engine trains of
less than 5000 hp total" and can be used to permit any such engine(s).  For
clarification on this particular exemption, the language used by staff in
proposing this exemption to the Texas Air Control Board in 1972 was as
follows:  "Engines smaller than 2000 hp are quite numerous and are not
considered a substantial source unless joined together IN SERIES (emphasis
added) to form an engine train.  Engine trains of less than 5000 hp are not
considered a substantial source.  Because control technology for NOx
emissions from internal combustion and gas fired engines is very limited, it
is doubtful if significant control could be achieved through the permit
system at this time."  ("Exemptions From Permits Procedures and
Justification for Exemptions," <signed> Charles R. Barden, P.E., Executive
Secretary, Texas Air Control Board, May 8, 1972.)

A list of the "Historical Standard Exemptions" is available on the TNRCC
Website at http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/air/nsr_permits/oldselist/index.html
<http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/air/nsr_permits/oldselist/index.html> .  In
applying these "Permits by Rule," be sure to check the corresponding
"Exemption Preambles" (if any) for any applicable General Conditions.

TNRCC has asked that we document such permitting of grandfathered facilities
by PI-8 AND a simple notification cover letter to them so that they will
have a record that the facilities have been permitted and are no longer
considered to be grandfathered.  The registration will buy you a letter of
acknowledgement that you have claimed the "permit by rule" (don't use the
term "exemption" in any correspondence) for these engines.

Subject: Response to 11/21/00 Teleconference 001204

I believe that we have now gotten the last bit of information that the TRNCC
will provide to us regarding the development of guidelines for 10-year BACT
for grandfathered engines and turbines for use in the VERP program.  The
last piece of information is an email that I am forwarding to you with this
email.  It is an email from John Steib to which he attaches an email from
Jim Linville.  In response to a request from us, Jim Linville sets forth in
his email an example of a large engine with emissions in the 29 gram per
horsepower hour range that cannot reduce emissions to the 2-8 gram level and
what the owner/operator of that engine must demonstrate in order to obtain a
VERP permit.
Remember, that in order to be included in the TNRCC's January 15, 2001
report to the legislature, a letter of intent or application for a VERP
should be filed with the TNRCC on or before next Thursday, December 7, 2000.
To summarize, we have obtained the following policies from the TNRCC:
1. Grandfathered internal combustion engines of less than 2000
horsepower can be authorized by Standard Exemption No. 6 effective December
1, 1972, regardless of the level of emissions from those facilities. (See my
letter to Kerry Drake dated September 15, 2000 and Drake's letter to me
dated October 3, 2000).
2. Grandfathered engine trains of less than 5000 horsepower, or a
portion of an engine train up to 5000 horsepower may be authorized under
Standard Exemption No. 6, December 1, 1972, so long as each engine in the
train does not exceed 2000 horsepower.  (See my letter to James Randall
dated November 1, 2000 and Randall's letter to me dated November 16, 2000).
3. Grandfathered turbines of less than 20,000 horsepower may be
authorized by Standard Exemption No. 82, dated December 1, 1972 regardless
of the level of emissions.  (See my letter to Kerry Drake dated September
15, 2000 and Drake's letter to me dated October 3, 2000).
4. Grandfathered engines and turbines that are able to be controlled to
the 2-8 gram range will not be subject to an economic reasonableness review.
(See James Randall's letter to me dated November 16, 2000).
5. Grandfathered engines and turbines that are not able to be
controlled to the 2-8 gram range may be permittable under a VERP if there is
test data to validate the old (pre-modification) and new (post-modification)
emission rates to document that verifiable reductions in actual emissions
would be achieved.  Also needed would be a representation of the cost of the
controls and even though additional modifications are available, the
additional cost is prohibitive. (See Jim Randall's letter to me dated
November 16, 2000 and the email attached hereto).

I hope all of this is helpful.  I have forwarded to you copies of the
referenced letters by fax on earlier dates.  If you need another copy please
let me know.

Celina and James,

During our teleconference today, you asked for an example of what we would
consider "significant emission reductions" that would be acceptable in a
case-by-case review when the 2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOx level could not be achieved.
A large 2-stroke engine that is currently emitting approximately 29 g/hp-hr
of NOx would be considered to have significant emissions reductions if
actual emissions are reduced by 50 percent even though it does not meet the
2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOx level.  We would agree that this would have been
considered BACT 10 years ago if there was test data to validate the old
(pre-modification) and new (post-modification) emission rates to document
that verifiable reductions in actual emissions would be achieved.  Also
needed in the case-by-case review would be a representation of what the cost
of the controls would be with a discussion of why the  2 to 8 g/hp-hr NOx
level could not be achieved.  This may be due to technical limitations such
as no additional controls or modifications are possible, or you may identify
cost in dollars per ton of NOx controlled to show that even though
additional modifications are available, the cost is prohibitive.

Re: Permitting Grandfathered Internal Combustion
  Engines and Turbines

Dear Ms. Romero:

As discussed in our meetings and teleconferences concerning the options for
grandfathered internal combustion engines and turbines, we have agreed that
some of these facilities may qualify under Standard Exemption Nos. 6 or 82,
effective on December 1, 1972 and others may be permitted under 30 Texas
Administrative Code (TAC) Chapter 116, Subchapter H:  Voluntary Emission
Reduction Permits (VERP).  Specific questions raised are discussed below.

You have asked for our understanding of what qualifies as an "engine train
of less than 5,000 hp." In your November 1, 2000 letter you gave two
examples of "engine trains" that you felt would meet Standard Exemption No.
6, "Gas fired internal combustion engines of less than 2000 hp and engine
trains of less than 5,000 hp total."  We agree that several engines, each
less than 2000 hp, can be combined into a "train" providing compression to a
common header so long as the train does not exceed 5,000 hp, meet the
exemption requirements.  In cases where the total horsepower in a train
exceeds 5,000 hp, we will allow exemption of individual engines within such
a train provided that each engine is less than 2000 hp and the total
horsepower of exempted engines in the train does not exceed 5,000 hp.  In
the same standard exemption list, turbines were covered by Standard
Exemption No. 82, "Gas turbines of less than 20,000 hp burning sweet natural
gas."

The other major point of discussion has been the determination of "10 year
old BACT" required by 30 TAC o116.811(3)(A).  As we discussed, our review of
permitting 10 years ago reveals that very few, if any, old engines were
permitted; so no data is available to show what we would have required for
nitrogen oxides (NOX) best available control technology (BACT).  New engines
were permitted at 2 grams/horsepower-hour (g/hp-hr) of NOX for both rich
burn and lean burn engines.  At that time older rich burn engines could have
been readily upgraded with catalytic converters to meet this 2 g/hp-hr limit
for NOX.  Lean burn engines were and are still more problematic as both
2-stroke and 4-stroke versions are available, and no single method of
control is applicable.  The large number of different engine manufacturers,
and the availability of various models, makes it impossible to establish a
single 10 year old BACT level.  Some of the older engines may be capable of
being upgraded to meet a level of NOX of 5 to 8 g/hp-hr, the level
established in the 1992 revision of Standard Exemption No. 6, which also
established a 3 g/hp-hr standard for turbines.  While the standard exemption
does not establish BACT for upgrades it does recognize what is available.
Many of the grandfathered engines are large and some have emissions as high
as 25 to 29 g/hp-hr, so significant emission reductions may be achievable
even if they are not able to reduce to the emissions control level of 2 to 8
g/hp-hr.  The 10 year old BACT review on these engines and turbines will
have to be done on a case-by-case basis just as we would have done 10 years
ago.

We hope this guidance will allow your members to decide which engines they
will be able to either exempt or permit under the VERP program and submit
their letters of intent to participate in the VERP program by December 7,
2000.

For engines and turbines that your members decide to propose for
authorization under Standard Exemption Nos. 6 and 82, please identify the
specific engines and turbines, identified by unit number, emission point
number (EPN), air quality account number, and plant name; and for each
account please submit a Form PI-7.  For each engine or turbine, please
submit a, Table 29 or 31 as applicable, and other technical information that
will support the standard exemption claim.

For engines that will be authorized by a VERP permit, please identify each
engine by unit number, EPN, air quality account number, and plant name, and
provide an estimate of the amount of emissions reductions anticipated as a
result of participation in the VERP program.  When the VERP applications are
submitted, information should be provided to show that NOX emissions will be
in the 2 to 8 g/hp-hr range.  If it is not possible to achieve this level of
emissions, please submit information that shows that it is not technically
feasible or economically reasonable to control NOX emissions to that level.
Information showing that actual emissions reductions will be achieved, even
when the targeted range of 2 to 8 g/hp-hr cannot be met, will be helpful in
staff review of the application.

We appreciate your assistance in helping us to make the VERP program a
success.  If you have any further questions, please contact Mr. James
Randall, P.E. at (512) 239-1078.

Max, I spoke to Pete Metzner of METRIC Corporation about the status of the 
environmental assessment you need for the above project and he said that he 
has received the packet you sent him but he needs to have additional 
clearification on some items which are pertinant for completing the EA.  Mr. 
Metzner was concerned that he would not be able to complete the EA by the 
specified time unless he discussed these issues with you.  METRIC has 
extensive experience with environmental assessments, but is not familiar with 
pipeline terminology and pipeline actions proposed uder the agreement with 
the Office of Pipeline Safety.

When you get a chance, would you please contact Pete at (505) 828-2801.

Thanks.

I might offer another simplistic solution that makes a whole lot more
sense in my mind:

Why doesn't the NYISO just separate their energy and transmission
markets?

barkerde@nmenergy.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



What if a product called External Transmission Reservation Rights (ETRR)
was
conjured up that would allow a MP to reserve in/out ISONY transmission ?
MP's bid on 50 mw blocks for a month. The numbers of mws made available
is
variable. The winners get the blocks with a bid block attached. For
example ,on
the PJM/NY interface 100 mws of ETRR's  for exports were sold in two
blocks of
50. The winner's are given the bid blocks of 9999 and 9998 respectively.
The
highest anyone not owning a ETRR could bid on the external interfaces is
+/-
9900 thus insuring the assigned bid blocks first acceptance of their
bids. Thus
the winners of the ETRR's (having already paid the ISO for the space)
have the
ability to schedule the energy or not. Obviously this is an idea in the
most
simplistic form that will allow the purchasing of long term transmission
in a
financial transmission market. What do you think???

"Roy J. Shanker" <royjshanker@worldnet.att.net> writes to the 
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

As a separate item to the concerns I had about the technical content, I was
a little confused on what was done here administratively. The last paragraph
says something about NYPA sharing the study. I didn't think they had
anything at all to say about it in the first place if it is an ISO work
product. If they do, could you explain why this is the case? If the ISO did
this, why wasn't this all posted on the OASIS at the same time NYPA got
this? The date on this shows a March 26 release.  Ignore these comments if
this was done, but I wasn't aware of this.

I am more than a little uncomfortable with a single market participant
having a month's lead time on ISO studies that can have significant
commercial impact. Think about the implications of this in the context of
people negotiating long term bi lateral ICAP agreements over the last month.
Depending on your take on the type of market changes that this type of
analysis might support, there could be enormous changes to the economics of
seasonal versus annual agreements, choice of equipment etc. This simply
isn't fair. Even if posted, this type of work by the ISO that can have large
potential commercial impacts should go out on all of the distributions at
the same time as release to anyone and OASIS posting.

Subject: NYPA study-Winter Locational ICAP requirements

At NYPA's request ISO staff conducted a limited analysis of
the winter locational ICAP requirements for Long Island and New York City
areas.  While such ICAP requirements have historically been set as a single
number for the entire year, it is NYPA's belief that this holdover from the
old way of doing business must be re-examined.  It is NYPA's belief that
most if not all of the contribution to loss of load risk occurs in the
summer months.  As such, some reduction in winter ICAP requirements should
be possible with no impact on the Loss of Load criterion of one day in ten
years.

NYPA requested that the ISO start with the database that
resulted in the locational requirements of 80% and 98% for New York City and
Long Island, respectively.   At NYPA's request the ISO modeled winter
ratings on the transmission interfaces into NYC and LI and determined how
much the 80% and 98% could be reduced in the winter before any impact on the
statewide Loss Of Load  occurred.  The report indicates that winter
requirements of 75% and 92% of the summer peak load resulted for NYC and LI,
respectively.

While this in no way reflects an exhaustive analysis of winter
locational requirements, the results from this study suggest that some
reduction in the winter         requirement may be warranted and a
consideration of seasonal requirements should be incorporated in future ICAP
requirement studies.   NYPA believes that       having an ICAP requirement
for summer and winter seasons based on the LSE's peak load for the
respective season would send the proper ICAP price signal.


NYPA is sharing the study results in the attached report in
an effort to begin a dialog which we hope will lead to a broader examination
of locational requirements when the issue is revisited again next year.  We
would appreciate hearing the views of other market participants.

I went to the New Mexico ED's web site and downloaded their latest memo on 
turbine changeouts. I had not reviewed it recently and it appears that their 
policy has changed (for the worse). This new policy is definitely not an 
improvement and does not appear workable to me.

In response to Roy's comments.  NYPA is paying for all the work conducted by
the ISO staff.  NYPA defined the study objective and all the ISO staff did
was conduct the MARS studies and document the results in the write-up we
provided to the tech exchange.

"Roy J. Shanker" <royjshanker@worldnet.att.net> writes to the
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

As a separate item to the concerns I had about the technical content, I was
a little confused on what was done here administratively. The last paragraph
says something about NYPA sharing the study. I didn't think they had
anything at all to say about it in the first place if it is an ISO work
product. If they do, could you explain why this is the case? If the ISO did
this, why wasn't this all posted on the OASIS at the same time NYPA got
this? The date on this shows a March 26 release.  Ignore these comments if
this was done, but I wasn't aware of this.

I am more than a little uncomfortable with a single market participant
having a month's lead time on ISO studies that can have significant
commercial impact. Think about the implications of this in the context of
people negotiating long term bi lateral ICAP agreements over the last month.
Depending on your take on the type of market changes that this type of
analysis might support, there could be enormous changes to the economics of
seasonal versus annual agreements, choice of equipment etc. This simply
isn't fair. Even if posted, this type of work by the ISO that can have large
potential commercial impacts should go out on all of the distributions at
the same time as release to anyone and OASIS posting.

Subject: NYPA study-Winter Locational ICAP requirements

At NYPA's request ISO staff conducted a limited analysis of
the winter locational ICAP requirements for Long Island and New York City
areas.  While such ICAP requirements have historically been set as a single
number for the entire year, it is NYPA's belief that this holdover from the
old way of doing business must be re-examined.  It is NYPA's belief that
most if not all of the contribution to loss of load risk occurs in the
summer months.  As such, some reduction in winter ICAP requirements should
be possible with no impact on the Loss of Load criterion of one day in ten
years.

NYPA requested that the ISO start with the database that
resulted in the locational requirements of 80% and 98% for New York City and
Long Island, respectively.   At NYPA's request the ISO modeled winter
ratings on the transmission interfaces into NYC and LI and determined how
much the 80% and 98% could be reduced in the winter before any impact on the
statewide Loss Of Load  occurred.  The report indicates that winter
requirements of 75% and 92% of the summer peak load resulted for NYC and LI,
respectively.

While this in no way reflects an exhaustive analysis of winter
locational requirements, the results from this study suggest that some
reduction in the winter         requirement may be warranted and a
consideration of seasonal requirements should be incorporated in future ICAP
requirement studies.   NYPA believes that       having an ICAP requirement
for summer and winter seasons based on the LSE's peak load for the
respective season would send the proper ICAP price signal.


NYPA is sharing the study results in the attached report in
an effort to begin a dialog which we hope will lead to a broader examination
of locational requirements when the issue is revisited again next year.  We
would appreciate hearing the views of other market participants.

assuring support to all customers.

Please contact any of the team members below for their normal efficient

Larry, please see attachments:  On large projects we usually refer to 
Norherns Plans and Procedures.  However, I think what may help you is a 
generic form that we use in Iowa.

Hi Larry,

      We had to change your logon this morning. With the new release of
our software, the "&" does not translate well on your logon.

      Effective 8/30/00 your new logon is:

      PGEES-TE

      The password has been changed to match.

thanks

Here are the waiver/notification letters to be forwarded to the CA State
Fire Marshall (for aboveground liquid pipeline waiver) and to the US DOT
Office of Pipeline Safety (for notification and aboveground waiver for
natural gas).  I have sent these as Word docs, let me know if you need a
different format.  Each package should include the attached project
description, figures (site location, aboveground installation), and
construction specs.  The Helt drawings that Ed Purcell put together should
be fine, you may want to highlight the proposed aboveground sections.  Kenny
has all the work specs and plans, which I believe the State Fire Marshall
already has copies.  Let me know if you need anything else.

Attached for your review, please note the photos of the pigs received on the 
mainline in section 4.  These are pigs Coastal oversized per piping specs.  
Approximately 10 gallons of liquid came in with the pigs but, for the most 
part it was in a sludge form.  The pigs are worn as you would expect and 
hopefully some of the photos will show enough detail to give you all an idea 
of the extent of the wear.  Samples (both wipe and liquids/sludge) were 
collected as per your direction.  Wipes on the top and bottom of the leading 
rubber on both the first and second pigs.  One liquid sample collected in 
front of first pig and a second liquid sample collected in front of the 
second pig.  This pigs ran fast (approximately 85 miles in 7 hours).  We had 
920 mmcfd flow half of which was flowing in the loop and the other half in 
the main line.  

First pig:



Second pig:



The Loop line pigs are running today and should arrive at sta 3 this evening.

David, nice touch with the NC.  I sure John will have some ideas on how to 
best to get this thing going after the NC gets back with you.  Ill leave it 
up to Mr. Shafer as to his preference to have dinner with Mr. Smith during 
our June tour of the C/S facilities.  Good to hear that the team  has bought 
in on supporting the NC by participation.  If you want me to, I can put on a 
little presentation to the other 2 teams in Arizona and see if we can get 
their support and participation also.  Let me know and we can do this at one 
of their safety meetings.......

Subject: Nature Conservancy Meeting

Larry, per your request following our phone conversation today I'm forwading 
a brief note regarding our dinner meeting last night with the Arizona Chapter 
of the Nature Conservancy.  

Hank Hull (Flagstaff Team leader) and I met with Edward Smith, the Northern 
Arizona Program Ecologist with the Nature Conservancy, here out of 
Flagstaff.  The purpose of the meeting was to make introductions between Ed 
and Hank and to informally discuss opportunities in which the Flagstaff Team 
could support the local chapter.  The Flagstaff Team made a committment in 
their Team Objectives and each team member in their Peer Committments to 
support the Conservancy in some manner this year.  To date all eight of the 
Flagstaff Team members (2 positions currently vacant) have taken advantage of 
the free membership offered through ETS.  Also, Ed was quite impressed with 
ETS's sponsorship of the employee and family memberships.  I won't get into 
the details but, it was obvious that opportunities will exist for the Team to 
become active in local activities.  So, as a follow up to the meeting, Ed 
will make a list of the areas and locations the Conservancy is in need of 
help and forward this list to Hank who will then poll the various Team 
members and solicit volunteers.  This may take a couple of weeks to get up 
and running but we should be well on our way by June.  Our goal, for now, 
will be to committ on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis to providing a 
given number of volunteer hours.  I'll keep you posted on how things 
progress.  

Ed also, offered to come out to one of the Team's meetings and give the group 
an overview of the Arizona Chapter of the Nature Conservancy and discuss our 
involvement with the entire Team.  And last but not least, when you, Bill, 
John, Rich and Randy come out for your West End field trip we may be able to 
coordinate a dinner get togeather with Ed to discuss any topics of interest.  
Just a thought.....   

Have a good week.......

Louie/Ed I know you guys are busy, but because of the emphasis Enron places 
on ensuring that action items from consolidated audits are completed prior to 
the action item completion date, I really need to know how Scott and I are to 
proceed on the subsurface drilling activities for potential contamination at 
the Bakersfield Fractionator.  The scheduled completion date for six of the 
items is 6/30.  I understand the there is an issue concerning Koch's 
individual and shared responsibility for some of the issues identified during 
the audit.  Rich Jolly has contacted me asking me when the drilling will 
begin, as he does not want to see us exceed the 6/30 date and have the items 
show up as deliquent in his region.  Whatever you can do to assist us in 
either initiating the investigations or placing a hold on the drilling would 
be greatly appreciated.

**IMPORTANT**

All,

I didn't catch the impact of this when I first saw it last week, but NYISO
is making a change that should cause real time prices to increase (relative
to historical prices) in cases where bid load is less than real time actual
load.  They will be committing GTs in the reliability pass of SCUC at an
incremental cost of zero (instead of committing a steam unit), which
increases the likelihood that GTs will run in real time under these
conditions, increasing real time prices.  The change goes into effect today
or tomorrow.  See below.

Scott

Larry,

I just recieved Ashley's request for support for her trip to Las Vegas, and I 
am pleased to inform you that ETS will provide her with $250 to assist in her 
expenses.  It sounds like quite an honor and  I am sure you are quite proud 
of her!!  A check will be processed and sent to you.

Please tell Ashley that she did an excellent job of drafting the request.  I 
could tell that she spent extra time and effort on it!

All of us wish her good luck in the competition.  Please let us know how she 
does.


Mike McGowan

Attached in support of Agenda Item 5B , ICAP, for the December 12, 2000
Business Issues Committee meeting, and pursuant to the motion passed at the
December 1, 2000 BIC meeting, are the following documents:

1. A clean version of proposed Tariff language on Stage 1A ICAP, consisting
of all those modifications made by the ICAPWG over the course of their
deliberations in the last few months with the exception of  (1) UCAP and (2)
one month OPP; and

2. A blacklined version of that proposed Tariff, marked to show changes from
the current Tariff.

The clean version includes a table of contents for ease of review.

Please note that, pursuant to the motion passed by BIC on December 1,
substantive changes not included in the ICAPWG November 21 Proposed Tariff
(considered by BIC on December 1) must be presented on separate motion at
the December 12 meeting.  The ISO has one such change, to Section 5.12.10;
the language was circulated prior to the December 1 BIC meeting and will be
recirculated tomorrow.

Please call or write with questions or comments. Many thanks.

Larry,

Actually, I'm going to post the draft permits and SOBs on our website.  I
think you'll have everything you need there.  If for some reason you don't
like the way that looks or prints, I will send you files.  To see an
example, go to:  http://www.epa.gov/region09/air/permit/epssdata.htm

Then click the first yellow bullet and drill down through CA and Monterey
and click on Calpine.  At the bottom of the form you will see yellow icons.
Click on the one in the field labeled "link permit conditions".

I will fax you our cover letter as soon as it's signed today.  Please
e-mail me your fax number.  Thanks.

Roger, to be sure I have all the right tools for your rough draft submittal
of the permits for compressor stations 3 and 4, please send me soemthing in
Word perfect  so that I can open and view.  I can open a PDF file so you
might want to send it that way as you suggested.  I hope that this message
isnt repetitive, as my email has been messed up and some of the stuff Ive
sent, hasnt made it to the intended person or agency.

Here's a listing of the permits expiring over the next year or so:

 GW-90  Portales C.S.  Expires 2/27/02
 GW-89  Corona C.S.  Exprers 3/9/02
 GW-95  Laguna C.S.  Expires 3/9/02
 GW-109 Carlsbad C.S.  Expires 5/18/02
 GW-110 Mountainair C.S. Expires 5/18/02
 GW-113 Eunice C.S.  Expires 6/19/02
 GW-283 Jal C.S.   Expires 6/24/02
 GW-285 Bisti C.S.  Expires 9/24/02

As you know, if you get your renewal applications in 120 prior to the
expiration date, the permit will not expire on the dates above, but will
extend until all paperwork is done on my end.

We need to go out and look at all of these at some point in time, but I will
get back with you to set up a schedule.

Take care and have a good Thanksgiving.

Ed

During the routine weekly sampling of the PG&E system, it was discovered that 
approx. 3 oz of liquid had collected in the new filter separator in the PG&E 
C/S yard.  A request was made to analyze the liquid for not only PCB's but 
also pH to determine if the liquids resulted from the caustic and water 
cleaning of the upstream portion of the pipe leading into the PG&E C/S .  
This is the first occurance of liquids at this location since this new filter 
separator was installed and put inot service.

Theiler, thought I would drop you a line and let you know how the hunt went.  
When Ryan and I got to the ranch, the guide gave us both a bull tag instead 
of a cow tag and said we had the run of the ranch and we could shoot anything 
we wanted, bulls or cows.  I took your word and didnt shoot your gun, which 
was a duel mistake, trusting your word and trusting your gun.  I saw several 
big bulls during our 4 day stay on the ranch and am reporting to you that due 
to my trust in you, and that jap junk rifle,  I never hit anything. Have you 
had anything in your life that would compare to the emptiness and frustration 
of shooting at monster bulls for four days and not hitting anything but dirt 
and trees?  Not only that, but on the way home, I wreaked my truck and died 
on the way to the hospital.  Im in heaven now, and spending my time putting 
the mojo hex on all your future hunts.  However, now I know why you always 
wanted to hunt with me, cause everyone else that you know and likes to hunt,  
you have given the same line of garbage about how good of a hunter you are 
and that  your gun shots true.....

Now for the true story.  I didnt shoot a cow, but Ryan did.  I never saw the 
30 inch mule deer, but we saw lots and lots of deer and elk.  I can 
understand why people pay to hunt on private land.  This ranch was a mixture 
of the Vi Vidal and the Baca location.  Lots of big open meadows and

We have acquired right of way with the following land owners:
Area Energy
Kern Water Bank Authority
West Kern Water District
Buena Vista Water Storage District
Kern County Water Authority
Southern California Edison
State of California for Interstate-5 and State Highway-43 crossings.

The only property owned by the State are the highway crossings. The Kern
River by-pass channel is in the middle of  West Kern property, right of way
for crossing it is with West Kern. There are permits Larry is working on
with the Army Corp of Engineers for stream bed alteration but I do not
think the state owns the property. I will do some checking and clear this
up.

Rick can you check on the land that the Ro Gas pipeline will be going
through and see if this is State land or who owns it? This will drive  what
permits or agencies we will need to deal with. Copy Larry on all
information.
Thanks

I will be holding a conference call today at 11:00 AM (Central time) for the 
purpose of relating some information I have received from Rod Boshcee of 
PG&E.  The conference number is 1-800-991-9019, passcode 6000796.  Rod left a 
very friendly detailed message on my voice mail yesterday afternoon related 
to the upcoming proposed shutdown and testing of the separators at Topock 
(which they previously agreed would be done around September 11 or 12.  He 
asked on the voice mail that I give him a call back and let him know what our 
decision is as soon as possible.

The following will attempt to summarize his voice mail message and will be 
the subject of our call today:
Rod stated that when we were together at Flagstaff in July we had decided to 
again take the system down and sample the separators around September 11 and 
12.
He said PG&E has continued to monitor their unit and have found nothing new 
since the June 29 test.
Rod also said that they have gotten consistent numbers downstream since June 
29 and everything seems stabilized.
He said that PG&E is "happy" with the operation of the separators and they 
seem to be doing the job that TW had said they would do.
Rod said that PG&E would go along with TW's thoughts on it, but they were 
wondering if it was really necessary to take the system down in mid-September 
or not since things were looking good?  He said they could go either way on 
it.
Rod closed by saying that they still had some concern about the sterility of 
the 1800' of pipe that connects TW's Meter Run with PG&E's Topock Compressor 
Station.  However, it seemed to be OK for now and they would have no other 
thoughts on it as long as the numbers stay consistently low on their side.
He asked that we let him know what we want to do as soon as possible so 
scheduling will not be a problem.

I would propose that we discuss this matter and then we can call him back and 
furnish our recommendation.  The cooperative tone of his call is something we 
want to continue to build upon and I do want us to be promptly responsive in 
that regard.  Thanks, John

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Hi Larry:
 Sorry for the delayed response. I have just got back from an
overseas trip yesterday. I am in the process of preparing a progress report
for you. We have obtained some additional interesting results. I was also
waiting for input from your group. You may recall that at the end of our
Houston meeting, John told me that he would be getting back to me on some
specific directions from the group. I believe that we would be done with the
major aspects of PCB work soon, then we would be focusing on arsenic. Please
let me know of any thoughts and ideas. Thanks Larry.
  We are finally seeing the Spring here and maybe a short one for that
matter. Summer is just around the corner.
Best Regards,
Michael

Michael, I know its been some time since we communicated, but how is the
PCB pipeline modeling efforts going?   I would appreciate a  summary from
you identifying  recent discoveries and a general update on the project.

Have you thawed out from the Pennsylvania winter?

Larry,

The hardware that is replaced during overhauls is:
All Bearings (#1,#2,#3)
All seals #1 brg, IGV & variable stators, #2 brg, #3 brg, #1 
nozzle,              #2 nozzle, #3 nozzle
All hardware (nuts, bolts, washers for cases, housings etc.)
All gaskets and packings (air/oil tube, oil drain tubes etc)
All o-rings (oil inlet tubes, etc)

This applies to recoupes and standard engines.  The thing different on the 
recoupe is that some of the hardware for the cases is different and the 
internal blankets are replaced.

If you have any questions or if I can be of further service, please do not 
hesitate to give me a call.

Leon O'Bryan

>> >       Since 809 is not in the US, it is not covered by U.S. regulations

>> >
>> >       Further, whereas many U.S. phones have 900 number blocking to

Well, I would suggest that you include some example of potential activities 
(not limited to them only, but they are possibly representatives of the types 
of activities that the RMEF could expect.  These might include:  the use of 
heavy equipment (e.g., bulldozer, road grader, backhoe, etc) to do dirt work 
or relocate materials from one place to another; to use volunteer field 
employees to  perform agreed to work on RMEF projects (e.g., fence building 
and/or repair, demolish any old structures, buildings, corrals, loading pens, 
feeding and/or watering stations, etc.); to plant wildlife feed plots, etc.  
Of course, all of this type work would only be done if both parties to the 
agreement had agreed as to the type of work, timing, expense, etc.  ETS will 
provide supplies and materials needed for all projects that are agreed to by 
both (unless a third party has already agreed to provide the supplies 
needed).  You could also add that ETS would consider the funding of certain 
auction items for local chapter banquets and/or purchase a table at such 
local banquets where we have employees that will attend.  

If this kind of detail is not what he is looking for, then we might have a 
serious problem in going forward.  If he is looking for specific details of a 
project - then you will have to wait until you get a team ready to offer a 
project to the RMEF for their specific consideration.  However, that will not 
be the overall umbrella agreement that I would like to get in place.

Let me know if this is a problem.  John

Subject: MOU


Larry,

Thank you for sending me a copy of the MOU between you and NWTF.  The RMEF,
while interested in working with you, will need more substance behind the
partnership and how we intended to work together.  I'm up to my neck in a
restructuring process through the end of the month or I would offer some
recommendations.

If you would like to take a crack at a draft MOU with specific details
associated with the partnership, I would be happy to review another draft.
In November, I should have a bit more time to spend on this opportunity.  If
you are simply looking for a local partnership to work on projects, I will
steer you to Alan or one of our local staff members in the region.

Again, thank you for the interest and I look forward to working with you on
a mutually beneficial partnership.

Dan

On tuesday of this week, Lou Soldano and I attended a meeting between the 
above referenced parties concerning the issue of PCB's which had migrated 
into the PG&E system.  Southwest Gas is a customer of PG&E's and recieves 
natural gas from PG&E for delivery to its customers,   PG&E has prepared a 
media statement which it is going to be sent out to those parties which 
receive gas from interconnects testing positive for PCBs.  As of today, only 
the customer base around Needles, California will see the PG&E statement.  

The two issues of note.  First, Transwestern was able to make some minor 
changes to the media statement to more clearly show in the statement that 
this release of PCBs was an isolated incident and that all parties are 
diligently incorporating measures to contain and manage this release.  
A copy of the revised media statement is available upon request  from Louie 
or myself. 

Second,   PG&E and Southwest Gas have jointly agreed to conduct immediate 
sampling activities at downstream interconnect locations on the Southwest Gas 
system to determine if the PCB's have spread into parts of their system.  
Results of this sampling will be presented in a meeting tentatively scheduled 
in a couple of weeks.  Transwestern will probably atttend this meeting.

Larry, below is a letter that Ed had apparently drafted. Ed's comments
below kind of indicate that he wanted you to be the one signing your name
and sending it, but it looks as though he was waiting for Lou's opinion as
to if you should be the one signing it.
Thanks,
             Scott

     Hell, I don't even talk like that:  I just tend to get pedantic in my
demand letters to Koch.  Obviously it's ok to leave that out -- doesn't
change the import of the letter.

     It has occurred to me that, since the time I drafted it, the signature
block might best say something like "Larry Campbell of ETS on behalf of
EOTT" or words to that effect.  Do you guys do that sort of thing?  Again,
I don't think it's essential, but maybe it's a nice touch to make clear
that this is a request by EOTT through ETS.  What do you think?  Thanks.

Looks very good but i'd take out the one reference.  Larry doesn't usually
speak like that (at least not to me..)

A meeting was held at C/S 6, Laguna on Tuesday November 16th, to reintroduce 
the pueblo of Laguna to Transwestern's environmental activities at the 
facility.  The Laguna's have hired an environmental person to oversee 
environmental issues on pueblo lands.  The meeting centered around three 
issues:  a UST site which had been removed, but not formally closed, a 
historic removal of asbestos which had been buried at the facility in the 
late 1980's, and the ongoing groundwater remediation at  the site.  

Transwestern provided a history of the above mentioned activiites and why 
these issues were unresolved in the "eyes" of the Laguna.  Transwestern 
committed to submitting closure requests for the UST and asbestos issues.  
With repsect to the groundwater issue, a presentation was given enlighting 
the Laguna representative of the difficult nature of the subsurface geology 
and groundwater characteristics to rapidly clean the contaminants 
(chlorinated solvents and PCB's) and Transwestern's intent to continue its 
remediation efforts. Transwestern assured the Laguna environmental 
representative that all correspondance and data pertaining to environmental 
issues would be submitted to the pueblo agency.   At the conclusion of the 
meeting, the Laguna's understood Transwestern's commitment to maintaining the 
policies and practices consistent with the pueblo of Laguna.

The meeting provided Transwestern and the Laguna's with the opportunity to 
meet and share ideas and opinions and initiate working relationships.  The 
Laguna's now have an understanding of the environmental activities at the 
site and what Transwestern's approach is to removing the contaminants.   The 
Laguna's appreciated Transwestern's efforts and commitment to environmental 
compliance on the Laguna pueblo.

Subject: Innappropriate E Mail Materials Received

I am sending this notification to your department to seek a solution of 
halting and stopping inappropriate e mail materials which I am receiving.  I 
have been requested by Louis Soldano, Enron attorney for the Gas Pipeline 
Group, to apprise you of this situation.  The content of materials received, 
I consider offensive, and am sure it would also be considered objectionable 
and innappropriate by the standards of Enron Corporation.   Please be 
advised, that many times it is  difficult to screen this material based upon 
the headings and titles that accompany the contents.  Consequently, 
innappropriate materials such as this are opened.  I have accidently opened 
two such e mails by mistake and have received the "Enron warning"  that my 
name and mailbox will be or may be audited in the future and that my name has 
been placed in a file.    Because of this, I am extremely uncomfortable about 
future accidents occuring and more importantly, about the increased frequency 
and accessability of my e mail box to trash and questionable materials.     

I would appreciate your immediate attention in this matter.  Thank you very 
much.

This is a bit long, but hilarious!!!!!


     COPIED FROM A NEWSGROUP POSTING - (the author is responding to a
woman who accidentally walked into the men's restroom):

     Please don't feel bad. It wasn't you entering the men's washroom
that caused that guy to pee on the guy next to him. Hell, we do that all the
time. It's rare us guys ever hit what were aiming for.

     Sometimes I go into the washroom, start to pee, and then just start
spinning around; just so I'll make sure I hit something.

     You see, something you ladies should understand by now is that men's
penises have a mind of their own. A guy can go into a bathroom stall because
all the urinals are being used, take perfect aim at the toilet, and his
penis will still manage to piss all over the roll of toilet paper, down his
left pant leg, and onto his shoe. I'm telling 'ya those little buggers can't
be trusted.

     After being married 28 years my wife has me trained. I'm no longer
allowed to pee like a man - standing up. I am required to sit down and pee.
She has convinced me that this is a small price to pay. Otherwise if she had
gone to the toilet one more time at night and either sat on a pee soaked
toilet seat, or fell right into the toilet because I forgot to put the seat
down, she was going to kill me in my sleep.

     Now another thing us guys don't usually like to talk about, but
because you and I have become such good friends and you think I'm a classy
guy, I might as well be candid with you because it's a real problem, and you
ladies need to be understanding. It's the dreaded "morning wood".

     Most mornings us guys wake up with two things. A tremendous desire
to pee, and a penis so hard you could cut diamonds with it. Well, no matter
how hard you try, you can't get that thing to bend, and if it won't bend you
can't aim, well hell, if you can't aim you have no choice but to piss all
over the wallpaper and that damn fuzzy toilet seat cover you women insist on
putting on the toilet.

     And by the way, when you use those damn fuzzy toilet seat covers,
the friggin' toilet seat won't stay up by itself. So that means we have to
use one hand to hold up the toilet seat and the other hand to try to control
our less than perfect aim.

     Now sometimes, when you're newly married, (and I know the guys in
here will back me up on this) you think you can get the toilet seat with
that damn fuzzy thing to stay up. You jam it back and compress that fuzzy
thing until the seat stays there. OK, so you start to pee, but then that
compressed fuzzy starts to decompress and without warning that damn toilet
seat comes flying down and tries to whack off your weenie. So us guys will
not lift a toilet seat with a fuzzy, it's just not safe.

     I tried to delicately explain this morning situation to my wife. I
told her... look, it won't bend. She said, "so sit down like I told you to
do all the rest of the time." OK. I tried sitting down on the toilet with
"morning wood".

     Well it's is very hard to get it bent under the toilet seat, and
before I could manage it, I had pissed all over the bath towels hanging on
the wall across the room.

     Now, even if you are sitting down and you can get it forced down
under the toilet seat, when you start to pee the pee shoots out from the
crack between the bottom of the toilet seat and the top of the bowl. You
piss all over the back of your knees and it runs down the back of our legs
on to that damn matching fuzzy horseshoe rug you keep putting on the floor
in front of the toilet.

     I have found the only effective maneuver to deal with this morning
urinary dilemma is to assume the flying Superman position laying over the
toilet seat. This takes a great deal of practice, perfect balance, and split
time precision but it's the only sure way to get all the pee in the bowl
during the first morning pee.

     So you ladies have to understand that us men are not totally to
blame. We are sensitive to your concerns about hygiene and bathroom
cleanliness, but there are times when things just get beyond our control.

     It's not our fault, it's just Mother Nature.

     Now, if it was Father Nature, there wouldn't have been a problem!!!

Dear Market Participants,

With regard to a prior posting of Changes to OASIS/MIS/CSS Systems
(please refer to original at bottom) implementation of the item:

*  A new internal application for Operations to manage units
placed out of merit will improve coordination between Operations
and Grid Accounting for the purposes of accurate billing.

caused some visible changes in the MIS web pages
that were not explained in the original notice.

The screens which have changed are:

- Gen Bid Query Page - New value of 'MODIFIED' in the Bid Status
dropdown.  This will allow a user to select only bids that have a
status of 'MODIFIED'.

- Gen Bid Query Results Page - The status for a particular bid may
have a value of 'MODIFIED'.  Clicking on the bid status link will
list a message page with more information about the meaning of the
status.

- Gen Bid Page - The schedule information at the bottom of the page
may list a bid status of 'MODIFIED'.

- Gen Outage Page - Once fixed, the outage information will be
listed on an hourly basis since the outage information is now tied
to the bids.

- For the upload/download, the templates for submission and results
have not changed.  Retrieval of generator bids may have some
records with a bid status of 'MODIFIED', along with a message tied
to the meaning of the status.  The outage schedule information
(once fixed) will have the information listed on an hourly basis.

All of these screens have not changed in terms of layout or
functionality, etc.  There are just new possible values for some
of the query parameters and query results.

Thank you,
Customer Relations

PG&E Fights Toxin in Gas Stream, Movie Fallout

     Sunday's Oscar winners have nothing on San Francisco's venerable Gran 
Dame of
     combination energy utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., whose film 
career and notoriety
     seem destined to win increasing Hollywood scrutiny if not gold 
statuettes. 

     Look no further than your local first-run movie theaters and the 
real-life drama, "Erin
     Brockovich," taking the actual name of the latest heroine to put PG&E's 
familiar logo in
     the klieg lights. Unfortunately for PG&E, toxins like chromium or PCBs 
in association
     with its gas pipelines can create their own dramas. 

     Just as the new movie, starring Julia Roberts, hit the theaters earlier 
this month, a new
     real-life problem confronted the combination utility with contaminates 
getting into the
     southern part of its California gas transmission system. 

     The movie is the story of a legal assistant --- a twice-divorced mother 
of three young
     children --- who single-handedly challenges PG&E, exposing its alleged 
operating
     mistakes that led to the use of chromium in its pipelines and eventually 
in the local water
     supply of a small, remote, high-desert town called Hinkley, which is 
about 130 miles
     northeast of Los Angeles. Lawsuits emerged in the early 1990s based on 
the
     development of tumors and other health problems among many of the 
Hinkley residents.
     By PG&E's own admission decades earlier it legally discharged wastewater 
containing
     chromium into the ground at its compressor station near Hinkley. Some of 
the chromium
     eventually got into the groundwater, and PG&E acknowledges it "did not 
respond to (that)
     problem as openly, quickly or thoroughly as it should have." It provided 
drinking water to
     nearby residents and arranged for medical exams for residents wishing to 
have them.
     PG&E also worked with local and state officials to clean up the problem. 
In 1996,
     however, PG&E settled a class action suit (one of several) with 650 
Hinkley residents for
     a record $333 million. 

     "The movie is a dramatization and it is pretty entertaining, so I liked 
it," said Jon
     Tremayne, a PG&E utility spokesperson. 

     PG&E CEO Robert Glynn told his employees, "It's clear in retrospect that 
our company
     should have handled some things differently at that time. And I wish 
that it had." 

     Litigation against the big energy firm continues. Involving the same 
transmission pipeline
     and geographical areas, the current PCBs found in PG&E's interstate 
supplies are
     coming through Enron's Transwestern Pipeline unit at the 
California-Arizona border from
     New Mexico but are not at harmful levels at this point in time. Routine 
testing early in
     February turned up the suspected cancer-causing chemical, which was used 
as a
     lubricant in high-pressure pipelines and compressor stations until it 
was banned. 

     "What we are talking about here is very low levels (ranging from 2 to 22 
parts-per-million,
     or ppm), well below (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) levels 
(50 ppm),"
     according to Tremayne. 

     Since the installation of a series of filter separators on both sides of 
the
     California-Arizona border, PG&E has concentrated on testing and 
following up along its
     southern transmission system that extends some 350 miles to the town of 
Kettleman in
     the northwestern part of the central San Joaquin Valley. PCB traces have 
been found,
     and PG&E has been working with the local gas distributor in the area, 
Southwest Gas
     Corp., to test for signs of PCBs in the nearby Barstow and Victor Valley 
distribution
     systems. As of March 22, none of the definitive results were in and 
there won't be much
     before the end of this month, according to Tremayne. 

     Both state regulators and the federal EPA have been notified of the 
situation. The federal
     EPA confirmed that PCBs are authorized for use in concentrations below 
50 ppm. It is
     the EPA laboratory tests that showed PCBs were known to cause cancer in 
laboratory
     rats. 

     PG&E spokespeople were assuring the public last week that the utility 
will "take any
     additional actions necessary" as a result of data from the ongoing 
testing it is doing of its
     transmission system and interconnecting distribution pipeline systems. 
And the utility is
     planning to install additional filter separators at various locations 
along its pipeline. 

     PCB-containing lubricating oils once were used routinely by a number of 
U.S. pipeline
     companies in their gas pipeline compressors, which help push the fuel 
through the pipes.
     While they are no longer used, some of the oils have remained inside 
some pipelines since
     the 1960s and 70s. If present, they are carried in liquid droplets in 
the natural gas stream. 

     Between the newly released motion picture and PG&E's local wrestling 
match with the
     PCBs, another class action lawsuit against PG&E stemming from the 
original chromium
     issue heads toward trial, pushed by residents in Topock, AZ and former 
residents of
     Hinkley not involved in the first suit. A trial date has been set for 
Nov. 27, and CNN's
     "CourtTV" program is proposing to provide live coverage.

Subject:  Rogas Line -- USFW Approval

     Randi McCormick just forwarded to me a letter addressed to EOTT, dated
February 14, 2001  from the US Fish and Wildlife Service approving our
project "for participation in the Kern Water Bank Compensation Bank," and
authorizing the Water Bank "to extend their incidental take authority to
you and your entire project under their Master Permit."  This is, of
course, very good news.

     The letter notes, however, that we still need to purchase compensation
acreage both at North Coles Levee and at the Kern Water Bank.
Specifically, we must do the following:  (1) contact Cheryl Harding of Kern
Water Bank to acquire 23.1 acres of compensation credits, and to get
included in their Master Permit; and (2) get Cheryl Harding a letter from
the Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve (Mark Poe of Aera) stating that we have
purchased 15.3 acres of credits for North Coles Levee, or that we have set
aside that amount from credits we have in the past purchased.

     While I could make these contacts, I do not believe that would be wise
because -- as Kenny can attest -- our past experience has been that
whenever a lawyer contacts the Water Bank, it prompts them to automatically
get their lawyers involved.  And our experience has been that this only
slows things down -- or worse.

     My suggestion therefore is that one or both of you gentlemen contact
Cheryl as soon as practical and ask her for (1) proposed contract for
acquisition of 23.1 acres of compensation credits and (2) perperwork to
include EOTT (and its contractors) in their Master Permit.  She should also
be informed that, while we have not yet purchased the 15.3 acres of NCL
credits, we will by the end of this week have a letter of credit posted as
security, as allowed under our State Take Permit, to cover this amount of
acreage.  Ask whether a copy of this LC will suffice for her purposes, or
whether we will need to have the actual acreage purchased.

     As this would remove a major impediment to construction of the new
lines, it is important that we move on this will all deliberate speed.
Please call me if you have any questions, or if you would like otherwise to
discuss how to approach this issue.  Thanks a lot.

                          --ETA

As you are aware, we are currently looking for some ERC's to satisfy an
Authority To Construct (ATC) for a methanol storage tank at NCL. We are
looking for approximately 175 Lbs/Yr VOC credits to satisfy this ATC. While
I was looking for credits on the APCD web sight @ valleyair.org, I came
across a list of available VOC Credits that are being held by Aera Energy
for the NCL gas plant (please see credits below), I asked Mark Poe about
these credits and he has referred me to a Darryl Gunderson of Aera Energy.
Mark informed me that he is the one that handles all of the ERC's and would
be able to help me on this. I will contact Darryl on this issue ASAP and as
we talked earlier, I am going to ask him if these credits should have been
transferred to Koch during the acquisition of the NCL Gas Plant and if not
I will see if we can purchase the necessary amounts to satisfy the ATC.

Ed, can you do me a favor and check the sales agreement between Arco & Koch
to see if there is any mention of these credits. Also inform me ASAP
whether or not to approach Darryl on these credits

Thanks,
             Scott

In light of the recent PCB issue with PG&E on the Topock Lateral,  I have 
asked Mr. John Woodyard of Roy F. Westin to c ome to Houston and make a  
presentation on PCB's in natural gas pipelines.  Mr. Woodyard has 
considerable experience in the management of PCB's and works closely in 
industry associations (INGAA and GRI),  Mr. Woodyard also works as a 
consultant in this capacity. 

The date of this meeting will be on Friday, September 3rd, beginning at 9:00 
am.  Lou Soldano will be setting up a meeting room and will notifiy all 
attendees via lotus notes prior to the September 3rd meeting date. 

I think this meeting will be very interesting and informative and and 
encourage all to attend, if possible.

Don,

There is no question you are right - this can happen.  You also know in
trading there is no transaction without risk (especially in NY).  Do you
trust the ISO and their software to effectively implement a whole new
settlement?  You may also be aware of some of the gaming opportunities that
arose when they looked into implementing the BME settlement.  The proposed
solution seems to eliminate most of the gaming, and yes, shifts more risk
over to the market participant.  Sometimes we have to take the bad with the
fair.  The 20k adder didn't fix anything - it only gave DAM transactions a
higher priority - if you want that security it is still open to you.  All
this does is give you the option to have the ISO evaluate your transaction
again the real-time . . . like any option, you don't have to exercise it.


Good luck,

Ray

I spoke to John Nystedt, the contact person for the Navajo Nation F&W service 
concerning the need to do endangered plants and animal  surveys at the two 
C/S on reservation lands.  I had sent to him the USGS quad sheets of the C/S 
sites for review.  Today he stated that he didnt think surveys would be 
needed at either location due to the fact that there had been historic 
disturbance at each location and that there was no sensitive habitiats in or 
near the C/S sites which would warrant surveys.  However, because of the 
issue of tribal lands, he was going to discuss this issue with the Navajo 
Nation director and verify his opinion and he would let Transwestern know on 
Monday of next week as to what the Tribes final decision would be, but he was 
almost sure that the Trib would recommend no surveys.  

John has faxed to me the list of approved botonists and boilogists which are 
approved to do work on the reservation.  I have contacted a number of 
individuals on the list and they are prepared to do the boilogical surveys 
next week  in the unlikely event a survey is required.

I have been contacted directly from InvaTech regarding Megafill.? In 
addition, I have seen photos on their website.? They currently don't have a 
company in southern California providing the service.? My expectation is that 
this would be applicable to us when we have larger diameter pipe that we have 
to grout.? However, I doubt that it would be cost-effective for grouting of 
service lines, just because of mobilization costs.? 

The Atlanta Gas Light PCB Research Consortium met in Albany last week, and 
UPSCO/Dow Chemical demo-ed their "Foam-Pak 180."? This has more possibilities 
for us.? Although this is more expensive than the aerosol cans that we are 
currently using, the high pressure of the "Foam-Pak 180" allows for foam to 
be pushed further into the pipe.? UPSCO/Dow indicated that their objective 
was to be able to push the foam 100 feet into 2" pipe.? I plan to explore 
this option further to see if the benefits outweigh the added cost.? I'll 
keep you in the loop.

I contacted John Sailane with Invatech responding to his call to Dr. 
Terraso. 

The material is a polyurethane foam used to fill pipes that are being 
abandoned in place.? He will send me some promotional information. 

Some not-yet-updated information is available on the web at 
http://www.roartech.com/megafill/claiming that: 

?? Over 1000 lf. of pipe can be filled per day. 

??? The line will be filled with polyurethane foam to over 50% capacity 
??? (in most cases 100%). 

?? Meets PCB Mega Rule (TSCA). 

?? Eliminates your need to track retired underground natural gas lines. 

?? No need for the one call system to be used for retired gas lines. 

?? Eliminates the generation of potentially hazardous waste water 
?? created by the rinsing method of abandonment. 

?? No waiting for test results. 

?? No cost for analytical. 

?? GPS equipped trucks. 

He said they have now filled pipelines up to 42" diameter.

Subject: Laguna PCB Issue

I received a call this morning from Jaroslav "Jarda" Solc (701-777-5217). 
Jarda is a Senior Research Manager for the Groundwater Resource & Remediation 
Group at the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC). Jarda reports to 
Edward "Ed" Steadman, Associate Director for Research at the EERC. Norm 
Moreno with the POEP had contacted Ed, provided him with my name and number, 
and asked if Ed's organization would contact us in regard to the EERC 
providing some assistance to TW with remediation of PCB contamination at the 
Laguna site. 

I provided a brief description of site conditions and we then discussed 
alternative remediation methods. Based on the information I provided, Jarda 
agreed that continued monitoring seemed to be appropriate. Jarda also 
indicated that his group did not have any off-the-shelf type remediation 
technologies that would be applicable. I suggested to Jarda that his 
organization might still be of service to TW in our discussions with the 
Pueblo and the POEP as a third party opinion. Jarda said that he would 
discuss this with Ed and get back to me.

"Kirkpatrick, Joe" <joe.kirkpatrick@nrgenergy.com> writes to the 
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Chuck

I have a question or two with regard to the following "Operational
Announcements" (Below). These are a few examples of many that are requests
for generation being requested out-of-merit by the NYISO for NYISO security.

In my limited understanding of the way SCD works I had thought that the only
reason the ISO or a Transmission Owner would request generation out-of-merit
is to resolve for a constraint or system condition that SCD could not (set
me straight if I am off-base).
Requesting generation out-of-merit to resolve for system security is an
effective method of quickly resolving for an out-of-scope SCD system problem
and by definition will not set clearing price.

1. What are the rules and procedures in place to request generation
out-of-merit both for local (Transmission Owner) and ISO request.
2. What other control actions have to be exhausted prior to initiating a
request for generation to be called on out-of-merit.
3. Are the generation bids available to the requestor(s) prior to making the
request. (Is economics a consideration?)
4. When load is available to be dispatched, will it be considered as a
control action instead of generation?
5. Is generation called on out-of-merit to resolve for DNI constraints.
6. In particular for Gilboa it was my understanding that prior to requesting
additional generation from Gilboa that an emergency was to take place. Is
there another agreement in place between the NYISO and NYPA. Below is an
excerpt from the ICAP manual.

4.4.2 Energy Limited Resources

Energy Limited Resources that are ICAP suppliers must be able to provide the
Energy equivalent of their claimed ICAP for four (4) hours each day. Energy
Limited Resources must bid or schedule in the Day-Ahead Market for
twenty-four (24) hours each day in such a way as to enable the NYISO to
schedule them for the period in which they are capable of providing the
energy.
An Energy Limited Resource must also provide the NYISO with information
concerning the hours during which it will be recharging or replacing
depleted
resources. Once the resource has provided four hours of Energy equivalent
ICAP, the NYISO will not call on an Energy Limited Resource during its
recharge
hours, except in the case of an emergency.

As an aside to this did NYPA declare the hours that it was not running on
May 8, 9 as recharge hours and conversely the hours that it was dispatched
by the NYISO. Was an emergency declared (as defined by NPCC).


I am seeking to get further detail in the operational announcements for both
local and NYISO requests for generation out-of-merit. If there are further
enhancements required for SCD in order to reduce the number of requests for
generation out-of-merit; what are they and when will they be implemented?

To the Distinguished Mr. Campbell
Just wanted to let you know that the list you got from James still had Jimmy 
Hoffman listed on the Hobbs Team. He has since left the company. I deleted 
him from this list. We could not afford for you to get behind.

Began initial field confirmation of EOTT crude oil tanks and equipment in the 
MIdland Region.  Five of the thirteen teams which have EOTT facilites have 
been inpsected and appropriate changes made to the database and spreadsheet.

A meeting was held with the Midland field teams which have Title V 
facilities, to complete and submit the required annual certifications.  All 
Title V locations in the MIdland region were in compliance for this year.

Region IX EPA has made a determination that prior to issuance of the air 
permits for the Redrock turbine installation, Transwestern is to conduct an 
endangered species survey of C/S's 3 and 4.  A contractor has been contacted 
and the surveys will be completed prior to September 15th.   This is not a 
new issue, as EPA Region VI, Dallas required consideration of the Endangered 
Species Act to be completed at the Luguna C/S, which is on Laguna Indian 
Lands.  The Title V permit will not be issued for the Laguna C/S until the 
EPA is satisified that endangered species are not a concern.  

Preliminary environmental and right of way field data are being provided to 
an environmental contractor to initiate a fatal flaw analysis of a proposed 
project for Transwestern Pipeline Company.

Continued EOTT crude oil release data collections for forthcoming Sept. 27th 
NFL meeting in MIdland.

FOR SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS ONLY

Summary of Customer Comments and Southern's Responsive Proposals
Docket No. RP00-476

I.  OFOs AND PENALTIES

Comment 1:  Provide objective criteria for issuing and lifting OFOs
including information that will help customers better understand operational
situation being addressed

Response:  SNG does or will post warnings and forecasts in advance
of OFOs and will work with customers to clarify tariff language on a
mutually agreeable basis

Comment 2:  A $15.00 penalty for Type 3 Alert Mode OFO is not reasonable;
$7.50 is more reasonable

Response:  In the spirit of compromise, SNG would be willing to
decrease the penalty to $10.00 per dth as part of a settlement package.

Comment 3:  The short notice and harsh penalty of the Type 3 Emergency Mode
OFO is unreasonable for the following reasons:
- Customers need more time to make adjustments
o Only implement if a Type 3 Critical Mode OFO
is already in place
o 12 hours notice would be more appropriate
- Limit application to abusive shipper behavior
- Clarify tariff that penalty only applies at start of gas day
and not intraday
- Shorter notice is not justified because if implemented too
late, a firm shipper cannot bump IT on last nomination cycle
- Justify adding the gas price to the penalty
- The increased penalty price is really an increase in
imbalance charges without other benefits
- Use Gas Daily's "Midpoint Louisiana - Onshore South" daily
index price instead of the one proposed

Response:  As part of a settlement package, SNG is willing to make
the following changes to its Type 3 Emergency Mode OFO.
- Type 3 Emergency Mode OFO can be implemented at the start of
the gas day on (i) 20 hours prior notice, or (ii) 4 hours prior notice ONLY
if a Type 3 Alert or Critical Mode OFO is in effect for the previous day;
telephone notice will be given when the penalty is upgraded to Emergency.
- Language limiting the application of each OFO is set forth
in Section 41 of the tariff's general terms and conditions.  SNG is willing
to repeat this language in this specific OFO section of the tariff, however,
so that customers feel comfortable that implementation of this penalty will
be targeted to the operational problem areas on the system or specific
offenders whenever possible.
- SNG will clarify that penalties only apply at the start of a
gas day and can be cancelled during a gas day if not needed due to a change
in conditions.
- Since advance notice must always be given prior to the start
of a gas day (9:00 a.m. CCT), shippers can adjust nominations on the
Intraday 1 nomination cycle (10:00 a.m. CCT) and bump IT.
- At the meeting, SNG will further discuss the reasons its
penalties (including the higher penalty for Type 3 Emergency Mode) are
needed to preserve the operational integrity of the system.

Comment 4:   The change to Type 5 OFOs could result in a shipper in a group
being penalized even if it is within tolerance at a point

Response:  At the meeting, SNG will review an example of how the
proposed changes to the Type 5 OFO will actually avoid shipper-specific
penalties at a point when the point or group of receipt points is within
tolerance.  This provision will only help, never hurt, a shipper.


II.  SEGMENTATION

Comment 1:  SNG currently allows firm shippers to segment their capacity by
rate zone.  It should be operationally feasible to provide more
segmentation, especially along Southern's two main trunklines.

Response:  SNG has reviewed its operational model and has isolated
two "long line" segments of its pipeline along which it could allow
intrazone segmentation in an operationally feasible manner.  At the meeting,
SNG will review the physical attributes of its system that led to this
model.  To be able to provide this level of intrazone segmentation, the
program would have the following attributes:
- SNG will retain its existing segmentation program, but will
layer on top of that the ability for a shipper to fully segment along
identified long line segments of its north or south system up to the firm
capacity that the customer has on the long line being segmented.  For
example, if a customer has north system capacity into zone 2, it can do
intrazone segmentation along the long line portion of the north system
through zone 2 up to its contract quantity on the north system.
- On the long line on which the shipper has firm capacity, the
shipper can nominate to primary or secondary delivery points so long as the
nominations do not overlap along the long line segment.
- The shipper will have to path its receipts and deliveries
for the portion of its nomination where it wishes to do intrazone segments.
This allows SNG to verify that segments do not overlap.  The first delivery
point being segmented can be served by an upstream supply pool or storage,
but all downstream segments must be served by physical receipt-to-delivery
combinations.
- Allocated receipts serving an intrazone segmented delivery
would have to meet or exceed the segmented delivery to avoid overlapping
segments and qualify for the FT commodity rate.
- SNG is in the process of determining the programming
requirements to add this new, more complex model and will provide an
estimate at the meeting.

III.  CAPACITY RELEASE AND SCHEDULING EQUALITY

Comment 1:  SNG should allow customers to offer and bid on capacity release
deals before each of the four nomination cycles.  (In its filing, Southern
has offered to enhance its capacity release procedures to allow prearranged,
non-biddable deals to be awarded prior to each nomination cycle, but keep
biddable deals awarded according to the GISB standards prior to the Timely
Nomination Cycle.)

Response:  While Southern is not required to offer these additional
options under Order No. 637, it would be willing, as part of a settlement,
to add an offer/bid capacity release opportunity prior to the Evening
Nomination Cycle.  GISB is developing standards for intraday capacity
releases, and Southern proposes to wait until the standards are approved to
offer more flexibility due to the programming complexity.

Comment 2:  Changes that require programming should be implemented as soon
as possible if ready prior to the time estimated by SNG in its filing.

Response:  Southern will implement all changes as soon as the
programming is ready, and it will give 30 days advance notice of the
implementation date.

Comment 3:  Southern should allow releases of FT-NN service on a no-notice
basis as soon as possible.

Response:  As noted in its filing, Southern is in the process of
programming this functionality and proposes to implement it on March 1,
2001.  Southern plans to make its tariff filing in mid-January 2001, and
will host a conference call to discuss the tariff filing in early December
2000.

IV.  IMBALANCE MANAGEMENT AND MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS

Comment 1:  Customers need more than 3 business days to elect to trade
imbalances because imbalances are not final at the time of the election
deadline.

Response:  Effective December 1, 2000, for November imbalances,
Southern has filed to implement the new GISB standard that gives customers
17 business days after the end of the month to elect to trade imbalances and
to complete the trades.

Comment 2:  Southern should allow customers to use other customers' CSS/ISS
storage accounts to resolve imbalances at the end of the month.

Response:  While Southern is concerned that this may increase the
level of imbalances, in an overall settlement, it would be willing to add
this option, subject to active confirmation by the other customer whose
storage account is used to resolve the imbalance.

Comment 3:  Imbalances and overrun penalties should be based on the lesser
of operational or actual data.

Response:  Southern calculates both an estimated imbalance
percentage (on the last day of the month) and an actual imbalance percentage
and uses the lesser of the two percentages when cashing out imbalances.  On
the overrun comment, Southern bills all volumes actually metered, but fills
up a customer's firm transportation service within a zone prior to billing
IT overrun.

Comment 4:  Cash out revenues in excess of the index prices, less expenses
incurred by SNG for cash out gas, should be credited to the SCRM account.

Response:  Southern does credit all revenues received for cash out
and will provide an overview of the items that affect the SCRM account at
the meeting.

Comment 5:  Southern received comments in support of and in opposition to
the collection of injection or withdrawal fees on the net imbalance resolved
with storage at the end of the month.  It was suggested that Southern should
go further and collect the fee on the daily (instead of net) imbalance
resolved through storage.

Response:  Southern believes that its proposal is reasonable and
equitable for the reasons given in its filing.

Comment 6:  Southern should be required to honor discounts to alternate
delivery points within the capacity path of the point receiving the
discount.

Response:  Generally, FT reservation charge discounts continue to
apply even when alternate delivery points are nominated.  Any limitations on
the applicability of the discount to specific points will be agreed to as
part of the discount and will be set out in the discount exhibit.

Hi Larry,

Since it's been two months since we have heard from you we wanted to check 
back with you and see if there is anything we can do to help you with your 
diamond buying decision? Our goal is to help you make an informed decision 
that you will be happy with for years to come.  Remember, since we don't own 
these stones, we are your personal diamonds consultants who will work to find 
the very best diamond for you at a great price.

Since you have not responded to any of our emails these past 8 weeks, we 
assume you are no longer shopping for a diamond and will remove your name 
from our active customer list.  We hope that if you are still shopping you 
will contact us so we can help you find a great diamond.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST since we are dealing with customers and 
suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always want 
to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and 
answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Aaron Breidenbaugh <aaron@global2000.net> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE 
Discussion List:

Greetings,

I was surprised today to learn that MSWG is recommending a delay in the
implementation of zonal price capped load bidding until the fall, when
it can be implemented simultaneously with virtual bidding.

The priority assigned to zonal PCLB is a settled issue and one that is
not properly before the MSWG or BIC at this time. The NYISO Management
and Board have already determined that implementation of zonal PCLB by
May is one of the ISO's highest priorities. Implementation of zonal PCLB
by this summer is even part of the NYISO Business Plan, Goal and
Objectives, and Incentive Compensation plan. In addition, the project
prioritization process adopted by the Management Committee has ratified
the priority assigned to this critical effort.

Apart from sporadic concerns raised by a few generators, there has never
been any indication that zonal PCLB should be delayed until virtual
bidding can be implemented. Indeed, it appears that the decision by the
MSWG to advance this proposal was decided upon at the last meeting of
the Virtual Bidding Task Force which does not even have official
standing as a NYISO subcommittee. That meeting's material did not in any
way indicate that such a major change was being contemplated, let alone
that it would be a recommendation to the BIC less than a week later.

The Price Responsive Load Coalition strongly supports the ISO's previous
decisions to implement zonal PCLB by this summer and views it as a
critical component of the state's efforts to engage loads' participation
in the market in a meaningful way. We will oppose any efforts to delay
implementation simply because some generators raise speculative fears of
"manipulation" of the markets by loads.

While there may well be merit to implementing zonal PCLB and virtual
bidding simultaneously, the proposal now before us threatens to throw
the baby out with the bathwater, depriving customers of one of their
only means of ameliorating the effects of markets that may not be
workably competitive.

>From both a procedural and substantive perspective, the proposal
presented to the BIC is fundamentally defective and must be rejected.

Sincerely,
Aaron Breidenbaugh
Executive Director

After a great deal of input from a large group of people what I hope is the 
almost final draft of the 2000 Tech Services is attached below.
Please take a look at them.
I will be at the Operations Directors Meeting next week to go over them.
For the Tech Service Teams you may find some of these which are appropriate 
to use in your Teams and Individual objectives.
If you have any questions please let me know.
Thanks

Add to this dilemma the fact that the import and export limits posted on the

"Pavo, Mike" <mike.pavo@nrgenergy.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE
Discussion List:

It appears that the scheduling limits between ISONE and NYISO need to be
clarified and/or corrdinated.  I offer the following evidence:

> ISONE transfer limit to NY    = 600mw
> NYISO ATC/TTC posting (import from ISONE)  = 950mw
> NYISO DAM Net Import (from ISONE)   = 800 to 1050mw


1. how can NY resolve in the DAM more imports from ISONE than their own
TTC or more than ISONE's transfer limitation?
> I understand that there is no restriction on a Participant selling DA
and taking the risk of being able to deliver, but surely the software
should recognize the TTC limit and cut/prorate schedules based on price,
down to the TTC limit.  And I would presume that the two ISO's would
agree daily on the TTC limits between their respective pools, thus
ensuring that the DA transfers are always equal to or less than TTC..

2. how can we get the ISO's to coordinate something as simple as
transfer limits?
> At one time in my past life, the limiting control area's limit was the
TTC value used for both CA's....this must be on the SEAMS agenda...

Inquirying minds want to know....

The Forest Service would like the new Compressor Building to be painted
dark brown.  The color should be close to the color that we use for our

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate 
the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.

Alert Posted: 1:50 PM November 18, 2000 (REVISED) Demand Mismatch Order Notice
Effective Monday, November 20, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., and until further notice, 
AGLC is issuing a demand mismatch order for the following primary pools. This 
notice is revised to include the Ex- Atlanta Group.
ATLANTA, EX-ATLANTA,  MACON, AUGUSTA , and ROME
Based on the current supply levels and expected demand levels, AGLC's system 
cannot manage the potential excess demand and the operational integrity of 
the system will be threatened. Therefore, it is essential that your 
interruptible customer's demand does not exceed the scheduled supply for your 
interruptible market for each primary pool under the demand mismatch order.
Each shipper/pooler/marketer is responsible for contacting their 
interruptible customers to curtail demand if necessary to meet this order. 
Marketers/Poolers are responsible for maintaining interruptible customer 
contact information. Any customer contact information in GOS is for AGLC 
internal use and is not intended to be marketers/poolers point of contact for 
curtailments.

The ISO (K Robb) circulated the ISO's position on the Def Penalties this
PM. It is attached.

As it stands, what the ISO wants now (or previously wanted) is an issue to
be decided by the BIC. What is now proposed - empowering the ISO to change
the deficiency rates if an adjacent ISO modifies (presumably upward) their
caps - has one large problem: if such an action were taken in the midst of
a Capability Period it would cause all sorts of issues with participant
positions.

Having said that I offer the following:

The FERC staff report strongly indicated that caps would have to exist (if
at all) on a regional basis and at similar levels.

In order to de-list and be free to sell out, a generator must make that
decision for the following month by the 10th of the current month. That is
trading a sure ICAP revenue stream for the increased opportunity to sell
energy at higher prices - even if some disaster befell one of out
neighbors, the amount that can move is limited by the transmission
capability.

What is the likelihood that any of the 3 NE ISOs will be uncapped next
Summer?

The transmission system limits how much energy can flow regardless of price
considerations. NY-NE about 1500Mw and NY-PJM about 2000 Mw (pending return
of the PARs).

BME, if faced with a reserve shortage (or inability to meet load), will
curtail exports to solve that problem.

Jim

The following message has been forwarded to the Tech Exchange at the
request of
Steven Keller of the NY PSC:


Statement of the Department of Public Service Staff to the BIC
Regarding Shortening the ICAP Obligation Procurement Period from Six
Months to One Month


The ICAP Working Group has proposed Phase II tariff language that
implements the BIC/MC decisions to implement a monthly ICAP obligation
procurement period (OPP) instead of the current six-month OPP.  It is our
understanding that this proposal is largely supported by incumbent load
serving entities who are currently required to purchase their ICAP six
month's in advance even though they expect to lose load to new entrants
during that period.  The LSE's are concerned that they may lose money
trying to sell unneeded ICAP back into the market.  Staff of the New York
State Department of Public Service (Staff) understands those concerns.

A report by the Brattle Group suggests that the existence of price caps in
New York could lead to capacity migration from New York under a one-month
OPP scenario.  Brattle suggests that under such a system certain
"optimistic" suppliers might choose not to offer to sell their ICAP to NY
if they think they could do better by selling energy into external markets
where they could earn high revenues in high demand month.   If that
happens, even to a limited extent, we believe it will likely result in
increased purchase costs for ICAP purchased both on a bilateral basis and
through the ISO auctions, and could also push up energy prices.

In a subsequent study by KEMA it is suggested that in order to avoid
capacity migration ICAP deficiency charges should be increased as much as
six-fold.  The obvious result would be that all LSE's would be exposed to
significantly higher deficiency charges under a
one-month OPP.  Staff does not view this as an acceptable alternative to
retaining a six-month OPP even with its potential that LSEs may incur a
loss as a result of purchasing ICAP for load they expect to lose.

As of November 29, 2000, the ISO has been unable to estimate the level of
deficiency penalties that would be required to avoid capacity migration
under a one-month OPP.  As a result, the New York State Department of
Public Service has been unable to verify whether the current levels need
to be increased, decreased or left as they are.  Because of concerns about
capacity migration, and because there is very little convincing argument
about the costs/benefits that would result from moving to a one-month ICAP
OPP that cannot at least partially be obtained from the six month OPP with
monthly deficiency auctions, Staff is opposed to such a change at this
time.   Until the ISO and market participants work out how to ensure that
energy and ICAP markets will remain workably competitive even during peak
periods, we believe it is prudent to move cautiously with regard to
shortening the OPP.

ATLANTA, EX-ATLANTA SNG,  MACON, AUGUSTA , Rome and EX-ATLANTA TRANSCO.
Based on the current supply levels and expected demand levels, AGLC's system 
cannot manage the potential excess demand and the operational integrity of 
the system will be threatened. Therefore, it is essential that your 
interruptible customer's demand does not exceed the scheduled supply for your 
interruptible market for each primary pool under the demand mismatch order.
Each shipper/pooler/marketer is responsible for contacting their 
interruptible customers to curtail demand if necessary to meet this order. 
Marketers/Poolers are responsible for maintaining interruptible customer 
contact information. Any customer contact information in GOS is for AGLC 
internal use and is not intended to be marketers/poolers point of contact for 
curtailments.

I received a call from Ralph Komai, PCB person for SoCal concerning new hits 
of PCBs at regulator sites on the Southwest Gas system.  It appears that SWG 
did some liquids sampling at two regulator locations near Victorville, Ca. 
and found small volumes of liquid accumulations (less than 2 oz.).  They 
tested the liquid for PCBs and found concentrations of 230 and 132 ppm.  The 
aroclors for the two samples were not known at the time of Ralph's 
notification to me but he stated that SWG plans to do further testing at 
their other 17 regulator locations.  This additional testing will be 
conducted in the near future and Ralph stated that he would share the results 
of his sampling with me.  It should be noted that the location of the two 
positive hits  were immediately downstream of where SoCal delivers gas to 
SWG. 

If we need to discuss this further, contact me at my home  (505) 624-0353 as 
I am taking vacation during the month of December.

TURQUOISE: DECEMBER'S BIRTHSTONE
======================================
The highest ranking among all the opaque stones, turquoise-
the "Turkish stone"-is highly prized throughout Asia and Africa,
not for its particular hoe of blue (a beautiful robin's egg or
sky blue) but more important for its supposed prophylactic and
therapeutic qualities.  The Arabs consider it a lucky stone and
have great confidence in its benevolent action.  Used in rings,
earrings, necklaces, head ornaments and amulets, it protects the
wearer from poison, reptile bites, eye diseases, and the evil
eye.  It was also believed capable of warning of impending death
by changing color.  Buddhists revere the turquoise because it is
associated with a legend in which a turquoise enabled Buddha to
destroy a monster.  Even today it is considered a symbol of
courage, success, and love.  It has also long been associated
American Indian jewelry and art.

Turquoise is an opaque, light to dark blue or blue green stone.
The finest color is an intense blue, with poorer qualities
tending toward yellowish green.  The famous Persian turquoise,
which can be very intense and pleasing blue, is considered a
very rare and valuable gem.  The United States (Arizona and New
Mexico) is also an important source of fine turquoise, and is
now the major source of turquoise used in jewelry worldwide.

All turquoises are susceptible to aging and may turn greenish
or possibly darker with age.  Also, care must be taken when
wearing, both to avoid contact with soap, grease, or other
materials that might discolor it, and to protect it from abuse,
since turquoise scratches fairly easily.

But exercise caution when buying turquoise.  This is a
frequently simulated gem.  Very fine glass imitations are
produced that are difficult to distinguish from the genuine.
Very fine adulterated stones, and reconstructed stones (from
turquoise powder bonded in plastic) saturate the marketplace, as
does synthetic turquoise.  Make sure you are buying "genuine,
natural turquoise."


THE DRESDEN DIAMOND: GREEN GLORY
=================================
The legendary 40.70 carat Dresden green diamond is now on
display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C.,
right next to the Hope diamond, until January 10th of next
year--thanks to Ronald Winston, son of the 20th century's
most famous jewel merchant, Harry Winston.

Today the Dresden is to green diamonds what the Hope is to
blues; the most famous gem of its kind.  Estimated to have
lost at least 60 percent of its original 100-carat-plus
weight during cutting, this green giant takes the prize for
size as well as beauty.

Keep in mind that beauty in green diamonds is nothing like
beauty in emerald, jade, or green grossular garnet.  Natural
green diamonds are extremely uncommon occurrences, the result
of irradiation deep within the earth.  And when they are found,
most are pale in color and light in tone, running a hue
spectrum from apple to algae green.  Don't expect these
diamonds to sport stop light or shampoo-green colors.

Nevertheless, the Dresden is a marvel--from a standpoint of
both shading and size.  True, there are green diamonds
without the vibrancy muting gray of the Dresden, but their
far smaller size makes them seem tiny in comparison.  The
Dresden is such a behemoth, at least as far as green diamonds go,
that it sets a standard that will likely never be challenged,
let alone beat.

DO YOU WANT A COLORED GEMSTONE?
==================================
If you have ever wanted a gorgeous colored gemstone but
never knew how to find one, this is your chance to have one
hand picked for you.  In Tucson, Arizona during the first
weekend of February, the country's largest colored gem
trade show brings gem wholesalers from all over the world.
We will be attending the show to hand select the nicest
gems possible for our customers.

There are hundreds of booths of gems including: ruby, emerald,
sapphire, garnet, amethyst, tourmaline, jade, peridot,
spinel, and tanzanite.  If you would like us to add your
name to our shopping list, give us a call and tell us what
you are looking for. Every year we make many customers'
dreams come true as we find terrific values on the highest
quality gemstones in the world.


MEN'S WEDDING BANDS
======================
While there are hundreds, if not thousands, of women's
wedding ring style, there are relatively few common style of
men's rings.  The vast majority of men prefer some type of
comfort fit wedding band.  The term comfort fit comes from
the rounded inside of the ring that helps eliminate the
sharp edges.  Comfort bands come in a variety of finishes
including polished, two tone, hand craved, and milgrain
edges.

For men, the choice seems to focus more on the width of the
band which can range from 2 millimeters wide alll the way
up to 12 millimeters.  Sometimes couples decide to get
matching bands and/or rings but generally each will pick
what they think looks best and is most comfortable to them.

While the current trend is for the use of platinum in
women's wedding rings, men are often surprised how heavy and
expensive a wide man's band is if it is done in platinum.
Yellow and/or white gold is still the preferred metal for men.

Because men tend to wear their rings all the time, the rings
tend to take much more abuse than a women's ring.  A women
will take her ring off to wash her hands, do the dishes,
or fix dinner.  Men leave their rings on to mow the yard,
fix the car, or participate in sports.  This is probably
why you don't see many diamonds in men's wedding bands--
plus the fact that men learn early that most families
can only afford one jewelry lover.

DIAMOND DISTRICT DANGERS
=========================
When we visit with customers, we often hear that they are
contemplating making a trip to the diamond district in New
York to shop for a diamond.  Many people have heard of the
major diamond trading center located on 47th Street in New
York and the myth is that you can get a good deal there.
In reality, the wholesale trading takes place high above
the street in high-security offices hidden from the public.

The vendors on the street are more skilled at taking your
money than anyone you will find in your community.  They
are fast taking, high pressure salesman who specialize in
letting tourist think they are getting a deal.  They often
sell uncertified diamonds and reply on the difficulty of
customers returning to the Diamond District as part of
their sales strategy.

We recommend you never buy from anyone in the Diamond
District in New York unless you are there with a trusted
retailer who takes you to the true dealers who are not
at street level.  Don't become another statistic of one
who got ripped off while trying to get a good deal in
the Diamond District.


ONLY BUY THE CLARITY YOU NEED
=============================
We see more and more customers being told they need
VVS clarity or they will be able to see inclusions in the
their diamond.  Why pay for something you can not see?

For all shapes except emerald, we suggest VS2 or SI1
as your minimum clarity requirement since with an SI1 you
can not see anything with your naked eye.  The truth is
that you can not see the difference between SI1 and all
the higher clarity grades except with a microscope.
Higher clarity than SI1 does not add to beauty of the
diamond, only the rarity and therefore the price.  By
starting with an SI1 clarity you will get a bigger
diamond and have a better selection for getting a great
cut.  The highest clarity grades cost more but are not
necessarily going to appreciate as much as the grades in
most demand such as VS2 and SI1 as explained at
http://www.dsourceva.com/investment.htm on our web site.
The reality is that the first speck of dust that settles
on the diamond has much more visual impact on the beauty of
the diamond than anything in a diamond that is at least a
certified SI1 clarity grade.


50% OFF SALE
========================
You have all seen the billboards and newspaper ads
advertising half off sale at your local jeweler.  It is
not uncommon for stores to mark up items 300-500% so they
can mark them half-price during a sale. It's no great deal
if you are paying 50%, let alone 150% over wholesale.

Don't fall for sales of any kind.  If a dealer can afford
to mark it down, then they marked it up too high at the
start.


PRICE CALCULATOR
================
Probably the most popular feature of our web site is the
diamond price calculator where shoppers can input a shape,
color grade, clarity grade, and carat weight to determine
an estimate of our price for that type of diamond.  If you
haven't tried it yet, check it out at:
http://www.dsourceva.com/cost.htm#calc


FAMOUS DIAMONDS
===============
Name The Star of Sierra Leone
Weight: 968.90 carats rough

Valentine's Day, 1972.   A routine workday at the diamond
mine in Sierra Leone.  Suddenly, a company engineer and a
plant security officer spot something big on the grease table
(grease sticks to diamonds and is used to separate diamonds
from ore).  At first, neither man could believe what they
saw.  There, trapped by the grease, is a huge diamond, the
size of a hen's egg.

When the stone is first offered for sale, none of the sealed
bids reaches the minimum price of more than $2.5 million set
by the government.  Finally, months later, Harry Winston
makes a deal for the Star.  Winston wants a world-class
diamond from his rough.  A 143.20 carat emerald cut is
fashioned, but upon close examination, it reveals inclusions.
Winston changes his mind, deciding that flawlessness is
more important than size.

The big diamond is recut into seven smaller stones, the
largest of which weighs 32.52 carats.  Besides these, the
rough yields 10 other stones ranging from 1.85 to 53.96
carats.  All told, Winston recovers only 238.48 carats, a
staggering loss of almost 75 percent.  But 13 of the 17
finished stones are reportedly flawless.

GEM OF THE DAY
==================================
Keep smiling.  Even when life knocks you flat on your back,
you are still in a good position to look up.

BEWARE OF FRACTIONS
==================================
The FTC (Federal Trade Commission) allows jewelers to round
off diamond weights.  For example, a diamond labeled 3/4 carat
in weight might actually weigh anywhere between .69 and .81
carat.  While these are small weights, the price difference
can be significant.  For instance, if you bought earrings with
G color, SI1 clarity and 3/4 carat in each ear for $5160, you
might have over paid by $1600 if they really weight .69 carats.

Note: Jewelers are also allowed to be off one color and one
clarity grade.  If you don't purchase a certified diamond,
you could find yourself at the short end on weight, color,
clarity and therefore, value.

INTERNET SALES
==================================
Internet shoppers are expected to spend almost $20 billion
online during the 2000 holiday season, nearly double last
year's total of $10.5 billion, according to a recent survey by
the Gartner Interactive Firm.  About half that revenue is
expected to go to U.S. and Canadian e-tailers, with the rest
distributed among firms in Europe and Asia.

Robert Labatt, principal analyst for Gartner's e-Business
Services Unit, credits the increased willingness to do
business online to the e-tailers' extensive efforts in
increasing the customer's comfort level.  Chat rooms and
opportunities to interact with the internet firms are
encouraging more people to try this form of commerce.

DIAMOND GRADING TIPS: FLUORESCENCE
==================================
Fluorescence, if present in a diamond, will be indicated on
a diamond grading report.  It will be graded very faint,
faint, medium, strong, or very strong.  Some reports
indicate the color of fluorescence as blue, yellow, white,
and so on.  A stone with yellow fluorescence should sell
less since it will appear yellower than it really is when
worn in daylight or fluorescent lighting.  The presence of
blue fluorescence will not detract, and in some cases may
be considered a bonus since it may make the stone appear
whiter than it really is in daylight or fluorescent
lighting.  However, if there is very strong fluorescence,
there may be an oily or milky appearance to the diamond.
We recommend avoiding medium or strong fluorescence since
it is just not worth taking the chance of lower value.


BOW TIE
=======
One of the most obvious indicators of poor proportioning
in fancy shaped diamonds is the bow tie, or butterfly effect,
a darkened area across the center or widest part of the
stone, depending upon the cut.  The bow tie is commonly
seen in the pear shape or marquise but may exist in any
fancy shape.  Virtually all fancy shapes cut today will
exhibit some minimal bow tie effect.  Nonetheless, the
presence or absence of a bow tie is an indicator of proper
proportioning.  In poorly proportioned stones there is a
pronounced bow tie; the more pronounced, the poorer the
proportioning.  The less pronounced the bow tie, the better
the proportioning.  The degree to which the bow tie is
evident is the first indicator of a good or poor make (cut).


DIAMOND AND JEWELRY BOOKS
=========================
One of the best ways to be a better shopper for diamonds and
fine jewelry is to read one or more of the great books
listed at the following web page:

Guessed wrong.  Can you run the 3512 low emissions case up to full power in
steps of 25%, including the 65% point.  Dont need the other cases.

The PCB Annual Document Logs for the facilities that generated PCB waste and 
stored it at TW's long term storage facility were completed and distributed 
to locations and entered into Envisions.

The 2rd quarter Transwestern/SoCal PCB mgt. committee conference call was 
completed.  This committee meets to discusss PCB management on the SoCal 
system and review invoices generated by SoCal during each quarter.  This 
quarters invoice amount was $280,633.48 of which Transwestern is 86% 
responsible or $241,344.79.

Final activities are in progress at the Topock Lateral where cleanup of the 
1850' pipeline and appurtenances has been completed.  Analytical results of 
the wipe samples and liquid samples taken showed the cleanup to be 
successful.   All wipes after the cleaning showed to be less than 1 
microgram/100 cm. sq.  Analytical results of the liquids showed to be less 
than 20 ppb.  The next phase of the cleanup activities will be in November 
when the remaining 11 miles of pipe will be cleaned and have launcher 
facilities installed at the mainline interconnect.

I received from the TNRCC an NOV letter for the above facility for failure to 
submit an emissions inventory for 2000.  This notification from the agency 
originally came to Rick Loveless by way of Wayne Brunette.  I called the 
TNRCC and spoke to Kevin Cauble concerning the NOV and he pulled the 
emissions inventory submitted in 1999 for the facility.  Because VOC's are 
the issue, I asked him what the emissions were for VOC's on the 1999 
inventory.  Kevin stated that the inventory showed VOC emissions of 19.50 
tons/yr actuals and 33.56 tons/yr potentials.  We discussed why EOTT would 
submit an inventory as it is not a major source and not required to.  The 
only thing we could come up with is that EOTT may have anticipated an 
increase in throughput at this site and therefore, wanted to ensure that this 
facility was shown as a title V source.  According to the phone records from 
the TNRCC for this facility, Craig Willoughby of Entrix had  requested that 
the faciltiy be kept on the list of facilities required to do inventories.  I 
have a call into EOTT to determine whether increased throughput is proposed 
for this facility in the near future.  

In speaking with Kevin, he suggested that if a determination is made that if 
there is to be an increased throughput that wont exceed the 100 ton/yr limit 
on VOC's, or that throughput conditions remain approximately consistent with 
previous years, EOTT should provide written notification to the agency that 
this facility does not meet the applicability requirements of 101.10 
(emissions inventory requirements) and request that this facility be removed 
from the TNRCC mailings. Should EOTT confirm the status of operating 
throughput to be below the 100 ton/yr VOC emissions limit, I will make make 
written notification to the TNRCC requesting removal from the list.

I spoke with Ralph Komai, PCB person with SoCal, concerning the SWG meeting 
about PBCs on the SWG system.  As mentioned in the last note, SWG has 
discovered PCBs and has been sampling to determine extent and movement into 
their system.  SWG receives gas from SoCal and PGE at two separate and 
independent interconnects.  Liquids have been collected at the two 
interconnects from SoCal at concentrations of <500 and <100 ppm, 
respectively.  They have taken approx. 100 wipe samples and have had "hits" 
but nothing over 100 ug per wipe.   

In the meeting, SWG has expressed aggressive interest to SoCal about the 
installation of filter separators at the SoCal/SWG interconnects.  They felt 
that the installation of separators would greatly benefit the reduction of 
PCBs into their system.  Becasue of this, Ralph stated that SWG would be 
sending him a proposal for the installation of separators at the two 
interconnect locations.  I gave Ralph Earl Chanleys phone number as he was 
involved in the separator construction project last summer with PG&E.

Dear Larry,

I am mailing the Part 71 application for La Plata A to you today.  I am
attaching the cover letter to the EPA for you to print out onto your
letterhead.  Please note that carbon monoxide emissions are included in
threshold applicability, however, they are not included for fee purposes,
therefore your fees for La Plata are based on NOx, SO2, VOC, and PM10.
 Also as a reminder, the letter from the EPA requested the application by
October 11, 1999.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Thank you,

Mary

Scott, I have sent out twice a request to each of the field teams in the 
Midland Region to provide some desperately needed tank information to 
determine compliance for all the EOTT crude oil tanks in the Midland area.  
So far, only the Midland, Lovington, Kermit, Andrews, Hobbs and Jal teams 
have responded. I would appreciate your assistance in motivating the 
remaining seven teams to get this information to me at their earliest 
convenience.  I have attached the most recent update of the tank spreadsheet 
for you to pass on to the teams.  

Thanks for the help.

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=
=20
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=

"Kirkpatrick, Joe" <joe.kirkpatrick@nrgenergy.com> writes to the 
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



Generators are supposed to be dispatched in the DAM in accordance with
their generator commitment parameters, many of these parameters are not
respected.
The minimum runtime is the one that is garnering the most attention, but
there is another parameter that would appear to be modeled incorrectly
which can have a significant impact on both the penalties applied to
generators and also on the issue of system security as it is applied to
system reserves.

Generators are loaded in the DAM in accordance with their loading rates,
the minimum loading rate for generators is 1% of their maximum rating. A
500 MW unit will have a loading rate of 5 MW/minute.

As an example of how SCUC loads generators I will use actual dispatch
data from Arthur Kill 2.

Arthur Kill 2 has a maximum rating of 359 MW and therefore has a loading
rate of 3.6 MW/minute.
The unit minimum is 90 MW and when dispatched from one hour to the next
should be constrained to what the unit can actually load.

We have received dispatches on our unit that would have the unit loaded
to 90 MW on average for one hour and then loaded to 241 MW for the next
hour. If the unit started loading at the end of the hour and loaded at
its loading rate of 3.6 MW/minute the unit would have loaded to 306 MW
by the end of the next hour. the unit would have loaded 3.6 MW/minute *
60 minutes or 216 MW. The increase of 216 MW represents an average of
108 MWhrs for the hour. Add the 90 MW from where the unit started from
its previous hourly dispatch and you will have an average for the next
hour of 198 MWhrs, this represents the maximum hourly average this unit
can perform and yet SCUC has the unit loaded to an average of 241 MWhrs.
This is impossible for the unit to load to and should represent a
deficiency for this hour in the DAM.

To further increase this problem SCUC has accepted the reserve bids from
this unit for both 10 minute spin and 30 minute spin for the hour that
the unit was already loading at its maximum loading rate. Since the unit
is already loading at its maximum rate, the unit should not be
considered for reserve since it cannot participate.

This problem is not isolated to this particular unit and is replicated
on our other units also.
If generators cannot follow their DAM schedules they must buy this
energy from the R/T even though it is impossible for them to match their
physical capabilities against their financial obligations as they are
dispatched to in the DAM. Add this to the fact the unit(s) are unable to
provide reserve to the system when they are already loading at their
maximum rate represents a system security problem.

I would suggest that SCUC only load generation at what the generation
can actually load to and be restricted to a maximum change hour over
hour of 30 minutes times their loading rate and if the unit is already
loading at its maximum rate then it should not be able to participate in
the reserve market.

I may be missing something but then again maybe not, hence the note to
the TIE list if other generators are affected in a similar fashion.

Transwestern Pipeline Company

Transwestern has run into some problems with the air permit conditions for 
the Redrock Expansion.  For the state permits, the ADEQ wants to abitrarily 
set a 10% safety factor to the emissions levels which approach PSD. This 
means that they have written into the draft permit a reduction in the 
allowable hours of operation for  the generator from 8760 to 7800.  This 
generator is the facility's prime source of power and therefore, needs to be 
operated for 8760 hours.  Transwestern will challenge the agency's authority 
to apply a 10%safety factor.

For the Indain lands permits, the EPA has written a permit condition of 25 
ppmvd for NOx and CO under all operating conditions.  Manufacturerers 
guarantees only apply at 25 ppmvd at loads above 65% and at 0F.  It appears 
that Transwestern may have convenienced the EPA to back away from permit 
limits in ppmvd and include as permit conditons lb/hr and ton/yr emissions 
limits that Transwestern originally placed into its applications.

Northern Natural Gas Company

A standard exemption for the NNG Martin Co. No. 1 facility was submitted to 
the TNRCC.  Preliminary maintenance activities and newly published AP-42 
emissions factors have shown that the Martin Co. 1 facility may be a Title V 
facility.  Under the old AP-42 factors, the units at the facility were not 
greater than 100 ton/year sources.  Continued investigation  is being 
conducted to determine emissions levels from the units at the facility. 

EOTT
A request and supporting documentation was submitted to the TNRCC to remove 
the EOTT Crane facility from the Title V operating permit program.  New data 
on the crude oil received into the facility shows the emissions limits for 
VOCs to be less than the Title V regulated limit. 

General

Preparations are being  finalized for the environmental roundtable to be held 
next week in Albuquerque.

As you requested, I prepared a list of requirements applicable to tanks that 
store hazardous wastes at LQG facilities.  I did not include specific 
recordkeeping and inspection requirements - you can find those in the 
procedures manual, Procedure 9.1.30 and 9.1.40.

If you have any questions, please call me at 281-997-9638.

Attended the construction projects meeting in Albuq. to discuss whether 
environmental costs and issues are included in the capital projects for 2000.

A conference call was held to discuss the late submittals in 1999 for the 
annual certifications for 7 Title V facilities in Texas.  The results of the 
meeting it was decided that a consultant would contact the TNRCC and find out 
if Northern would benefit from  offering "suplemental environmental projects" 
performed on the system to further reduce the NOV amount.  The TNRCC assessed 
a fine in the amount of $13,125 of which $2625 was reduced  for self 
reporting and the reputation that  NNG has with the TNRCC.   Additional 
actions may be taken including meeting with the agency to discuss further $$$ 
reductions.

The proposed removal date for the turbine at C/S 8 is 3/31.  

A meeting was held with the Mountainair team to discuss Title V permit 
complaince and emisisons testing  during the April outage.

Annual emissions inventories were submitted to the state of Arizona for C/S 
1, 2, and the Flagstaff Lateral.

The TNRCC announced that they would conduct air inspections at the following 
facilites:  Wt-2, Walton and Keystone C/S's.  The Kermit team has been 
notified and is compiling the necessary records and paperwork for the 3/31 
inspections.

Guys, look at the attached draft of a letter I plan on sending to the Laguna 
pueblo regarding Transwestern efforts to date of finding new technologies to 
address and remove PCB contamination from the groundwater at the facility.

You may remember, we had a meeting in January to hear the Laguna's concerns 
that Transwestern was not moving fast enough to clean up the site.  This 
letter addresses our attempts to find a solution to the PCB problem, and that 
remediation technologies are not presently available to operate effectively 
at the site given the sites unique characterisstics.  Id like to send this 
out on Friday or Monday.

I was just informed by the Navajo Nation that prior to receiving approval 
from the agency fo rthe installation of the turbines, an archeology survey is 
to be performed at each compressor station site.  Be advised that an 
archeologist will be present at sta. 3 on 3/ 9 this friday in the am and at 
sta. 4 on 3/12 monday also in the am to conduct the required surveys.  Please 
have someone from each team present at each location during the surveys and 
allow access to the facility by the archeologist.  The survey should only 
last 3-4 hours.  

Donna, I spoke to the Navajo Nation about expiditing the report submittal 
once the archeological surveys have been completed and the Nation  said that 
under their current regulations, assuming that there are no cultural 
resources identified at either location, they are allowed 30 days to review 
the findings before they are required to issue the final report.  She didnt 
think it would take this long, but said that due to existing surveys back 
logs, and personnel, it might.  Ill keep the pressure on.

The Navajo Nation F&W has not returned my call about what they might 
require.  Birds of a feather...  Ill be persistent here also.......and let 
you know when I find out something..........

Roger, presented below are the comments which Transwetern has on the permits 
which were issued to the Klagetoh and Luepp compressor station.  The most 
critical and sensitive issue for us is item 2 below. The permits really 
restrict us and cause us some major operational concerns if we are held to 25 
ppmvd for NOx and CO throughout the entire operating range of the turbines.  
We would really appreciate your help and assistance in this issue.  Let me 
know what additional information you may need. 


1.The responsible official name change to Danny Pribble, VP Southwest
Operations.

2.The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to 25 ppmv at 15% O2, based
on a 3-hour  average, except during periods of startup and shutdown.  At 60F
and above the GE data indicates that these rates are achievable under all
operating conditions.  However, GE data indicates that NOx and CO may be as 
high as 40 ppmv during low-load conditions of 60% and lower.

The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of
the time with reduced load operations (64% load)occurring no more than 20%
of the time.  TWP also included a 15% safety factor to cover periods of
reduced operating loads and fluctuating ambient temperatures.  The potential
to emit calculations presented the emissions in the application in units of
lb/hr and ton/yr.  These potential to emit values were accepted by the EPA
for the netting analysis, and were taken into account by the EPA (See EPA
Statement of Basis document). Because the permit conditions hold us to ppmvd
values and not lb/yr or ton/year values, Transwestern is concerned that
under low load conditions of less than 60% and low ambient temperatures, the
emissions of NOx and CO could go as high as 40 ppmvd.  Transwestern is
requesting that a provision be made in the permit conditions that allows
emissions of NOx and CO be held to 40 ppmvd during the 20 % of the time that
the turbines operating conditions is less than or equal to 60% load.

3. The word "Catepillar" is mispelled throughout the permit.

4. Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas requires
Transwestern to use methodologies (wet chemistry technology) that are not
normally used to monitor and       measure sulfur in the natural gas.
Transwestern has received approval from the EPA for other custom fuel
monitoring schedules to use  "GPA Standard 2377" (length of stain tube) or
gas chromatography as the proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in the
natural gas.

Sorry I have not responded sooner, but I've been tied up with the crude lines 
transaction.

The mercury contamination by the old meter shop and hydrocarbon contamiantion 
at the truck rack are Koch's responsibility.  Per EOTT/Koch contract, Koch 
must be allowed to do the remediation.  I sent Koch a letter in December 
requesting they undertake it.  I suggest a call (followed up by a letter) to 
Frank Van Ryn at Koch to set it up.  I'm happy to review or write such a 
letter.  But at this point, you guys should be coordinating with Koch for 
Koch to remediate.

If any other items on your audit need to be addressed (e.g., chromium), 
please let me know, as I will need to send a demand letter to Koch for them 
if they are Koch's responsibility.  Thanks.  --ETA

Louie/Ed I know you guys are busy, but because of the emphasis Enron places 
on ensuring that action items from consolidated audits are completed prior to 
the action item completion date, I really need to know how Scott and I are to 
proceed on the subsurface drilling activities for potential contamination at 
the Bakersfield Fractionator.  The scheduled completion date for six of the 
items is 6/30.  I understand the there is an issue concerning Koch's 
individual and shared responsibility for some of the issues identified during 
the audit.  Rich Jolly has contacted me asking me when the drilling will 
begin, as he does not want to see us exceed the 6/30 date and have the items 
show up as deliquent in his region.  Whatever you can do to assist us in 
either initiating the investigations or placing a hold on the drilling would 
be greatly appreciated.

"Pavo, Mike" <mike.pavo@nrgenergy.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE 
Discussion List:

NRG respectfully requests a written clarification of the events and
consequences of the apparent schedule deviation on Phase I/II for December
08 HE21.  The data shows a schedule of 1100mw into NE and an actual flow of
450mw, a deficiency of at least 650mw for the entire hour.

Questions:
1. Is the data correct?  If no what was the error?  If yes see below;
2. Was there an emergency energy sale to HQ for this hour to cover the
deficiency?
3. What was the impact to energy and ancillary prices?
4. What was the impact on the NERC performance criteria (CPS1 and CPS2)?
5. Is the deficiency intended to be resolved thru inadvertent energy
account?


Below is the printout of the flow and schedule.

Thanks

Rick, I got to thinking about this again last night with regards to the
effects towards Emissions and/or unit performance (air fuel ratio's
etc....)   So, I visited with a couple of folks today and we will need to
cross some hurdles with regards to our customers.  The air fuel ratio will
change so dramitically from a 1000 btu to a 1200 btu (just to use numbers)
that a sudden transition from one range to the other has and will probably
initiate an overspeed or flameout situation on the customers units.
Emmission levels will increase as the btu increases and depending on
current permit levels this may or may not require additional permitting on
the customers end.  (I would think as long as we are in spec, the Emissions
issue would still be the customers issue to deal with)  To adjust fuel/air
ratio's with some pre-warning (prior to overspeed or flameout) we may need
to provide a signal from our gas chromatograph to the customers unit RTU or
discuss the necessity of getting the customer to install their own
chromatograph.

These aren't any big hills to overcome (at least I wouldn't think they are)
but, again, you may want to have some suggestions or answers to the
questions before they are posed.....

Moving on:  "Never be afraid to try something new.  Remember that amatuers
built the ark.  Professionals built the titanic."

Rich,

I have an idea. It is a little far fetched, but could potentially make
Enron 100MM in the first year so hear me out.

At the regional meeting this month, I was interested in the discussions
about the gas delivery's to the California border, and how the pipeline was
running at capacity. When I heard the potential of dollars that could be
made If we only had more capacity, I was shocked. This will hopefully be a
way to increase your MMBTU delivery without major expense. Someone might
have already looked at this, but if not, it might be worth the time.

Although the pipeline is full of MCF's it has room if you look at BTU's. I
received an analysis of the gas delivered to the border and found it was
running at 1015 BTU, with less than %.5 C3+. With the SoCal limit of C3+ at
%3, there is room to inject %2.5 C3+ and raise that BTU value.

The Idea is to use rail cars to transport Normal Butane (or any other NGL
that proves cost affective) to the California border, vaporize the liquid,
and inject the vapor into the pipeline up-stream of the custody meter to
SoCal Gas.

I know there is rail access in the area, so this should not be an issue. We
off-load the product, and vaporize it using heaters, or the more efficient
way is to use waste heat from a turbine engine. We then compress the vapor
and introduce it into the pipeline. My estimates are we can off-load up to
52 rail cars per day, vaporize the butane and compress the 50 MCF/day of
gas to pipeline pressure. This will raise the C3+ number to approximately
%2.75 just under the SoCal spec. The 52 rail cars of Butane will introduce
another 160,000 MMBTU per day but only raise your volume by 50MMCF, hardly
noticeable when you are at 2.2BCF. This idea will work at any facility
along the pipeline system that is a large delivery.

The C3+ that has the largest impact is Normal Butane due to is relatively
low cost and high BTU value. I am not sure what the Butane market is in
other areas, but we are selling Normal currently for .65c. /gal, and this
is abnormally high for California. The value of Normal Butane used in the
spreadsheet is .65c, the contract price currently used at the NCL plant.

I assumed .05c per gallon for operating cost. This number is conservative
as our operating cost at the NCL plant is .035c - .04c per gallon with full
fractionation. This number includes fuel necessary for vaporizing the
Butane, employees, etc. This operating cost number will drop dramatically
if we are able to use waste heat from a turbine. Most of the cost is fuel
necessary to run the heater.

The price used for sales gas is what I am not sure about. The price of
$8.50 /MMBTU is the number I have heard will hold for at least the next
year at the Cal. border, and possibly go up. No one knows if this is
sustainable for any length of time, but it is what I assumed for this
spreadsheet. (Notice the profit if you enter the gas value currently traded
at the Cal. border)

Take a look at the spreadsheet and hopefully it will clarify where I came
up with these numbers. All the BTU and MCF numbers for Normal Butane came
from the GPA Standard 2145 and all other numbers are my best guess. If you
find this an interesting idea, please forward to the appropriate people. I
would love to discuss it further so let me know what you think.

Rick

The oil and gas production (O&G) and transmission and storage (T&S) MACT 
rules have been signed by EPA and should appear in the Federal Register very 
soon (late May or early June). You will have three years to comply for 
existing sources, but new sources must comply with these regulations as soon 
as the rules appear in the Federal Register. New sources, as defined in the 
regulations, are any dehys that were installed on or after February 6, 1998. 
I will be putting out an Environmental Notice about these rules, but if you 
have a dehy that was installed on or after February 6, 1998, contact me and 
we can discuss how to get that unit into compliance immediately. In addition 
to control requirements, you will have 120 days to notify EPA about any new 
sources.

Just wanted to update you on the Dept of Fish & Game 1603 notification.

I spoke with Clarence Mayott in the DFG Fresno office.  He said based on his
knowledge of the area and the information provided that our project should
not require 1603 permitting.  He did want to see the notification package
and anticipates providing a letter stating that the project is outside the
scope of Section 1600 of the Fish & Game code.  He also commented on CEQA
(Calif. Env. Quality Act) requirements, particularly the wildlife and
habitat issues.  He thinks that with the CESA 2081 permit and a letter from
Kern County regarding the ministerial nature of this project, we might be
able claim that CEQA has been addressed.  This will be ultimately decided by
either the Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) or State Rec Board
as these are state agencies which may be issuing discretionary permits.  If
either of these agencies requires CEQA analysis, they may rely on the
County's letter and the 2081 permit, or they would have to do their own CEQA
analysis.  I'm working on getting a letter from the Kern County Planning
Dept.  Do you have a copy of the 2081 documents?  This is one document I
never received from EOTT.

  Plug this into the bottom of Page 2 of Attachment 1, which
is our response
  to #19 of the Project Questionnaire.  Also, you might
consider inserting
  this into the cover letter just to drive the point home that
we have
  CESA/FESA coverage under existing agreements.

            EOTT presently holds a Memorandum of Understanding
(M.O.U.
  No. 2081-1997-97-4) with the California Dept. of Fish and
Game pursuant to
  incidental take of species listed under the California
Endangered Species
  Act (CSA) Section 2081.  This M.O.U. applies to operations
(including
  pipeline activities) related to the North Coles Levee
Fractionator Plant
  and
  the Rogas rail facility.  EOTT has also reached agreement
with Kern Water
  Bank Authority (KWBA) to use their Section 10 (a) (1) (b)
permit for
  incidental take of species listed under the Federal
Endangered Species Act
  (FESA).

  Also, I spoke with Ed Purcell of Helt Engineering regarding
the cross
  sections showing a trench depth of 7'.  He said he will
modify the drawings
  and e-mail upon completion.  We should probably make note of
this pending
  change somewhere in our materials (see item #8 on Pg 2 of
Attachment 1).

Mr. Campbell,

Attached is the PTE analysis for Martin Co. #1 using data provided by Ruth
Jensen.  The PTE for CO is approximately 99.38 tpy.  This is using the AP-42
factors for 4-cycle rich engines operating at less than 90% load.  This PTE
analysis is very close to the Title V limits.  CLose enough to warrant
verification of all parameters.  As you recall AP-42 factors for 4-cycle
rich burns used to be 10 g/hp-hr for equal NOx equal CO operations.  The
AP-42 engine factors were revised in 2000 which resulted in a big increase
in CO emissions.  If you use the current AP-42 factors for 90-105% load, we
bust 100 tpy for CO.

When we do the emissions testing at C/S No. 3, Luepp, we should be aware of 
the positives and negatives.  The positives being the information which Steve 
and company will collect.  This appears to be a  very useful tool.  There is 
also is no permit emission limits associated with the permit at this 
facility.  There also exists the potential to pay lower emissions fees should 
this investigation show that the emissions from the units to be significantly 
lower than what was placed into the permit application.  The downside to this 
effort is that the data we collect may in fact show that our emissions fees 
which we have been paying actually under estimate those submitted in our 
application and we would more than likely be held accountable for the 
difference (1996 to the present).  Additionally, enforcement action could 
result by the Navajos.  I say this to apprise everyone of the positive and 
negative potentials involved in completing this study.  From the emission 
estimates which were placed into the permit application we included a 
defendable buffer or excess of emissions to account for variations in the 
temperature, humidity, engine age and poor engine mechanics should they 
exist.  

And finally, we have the unknown of not knowing what the three units actually 
emit.  These units have never been tested.  This uncertanty in itself may be 
the driver to know so as not to have a situation which was similar to what 
happened at Atoka No. 3 several months ago.

I just spent about 40 minutes on the phone with my counterpart discussing the 
upcoming meeting.   The call was cordial.  A couple of items that came up 
worth passing on are as follows:

 There is some expectation in PG&E to decon the compressors.  They may not 
wish to do so right now but maybe soon.  There is also discussion of these 
being out of service for up to a couple of months.  I passed along the idea 
that it is probably best to simply monitor the situation and the PCB matters 
may well take care of themselves through routine maintenance activities and 
continued operation.  No official decon processes exist as far as were are 
aware.  There are no restrictions on their continued use exist at that 
location.  PG&E may be considering employee exposure or continued source of 
contamination as issues why they want to decon. We should expect to this to 
come up during the meeting.  I do not think that this type of decon would 
necessarily be in line with the standard for reimbursement under our 
operating agreement - which is "reasonable action, measured in accordance 
with commonly accepted standards of care and practice in the natural gas 
pipeline industry in California."  I'm not aware of SoCal engaging in any 
such action even though their system was highly impacted by PCBs.   I did not 
bring this standard up but we should be aware of it and recommend monitoring 
before any decisions are made.  My counterpart did acknowledge that even when 
the Long Term facilities eliminated the delivery problem, that we may well 
have continued issues with respect to the PCBs in the station and the 15 
miles of pipe downstream for some lengthy period of time.  PG&E did not 
appear to be contemplating any pigging or decon of this section of the system.

 PG&E may be looking for some more comfort on the question of "source 
control".  We have said that this situation is relatively unique to the 
Topock Lateral but we have had some minor hits elsewhere recently.  We should 
be in a position to explain why the remainder of the system is not a problem 
and even if it should be why the Long term facilities should be able to 
handle any concerns.

"Mark Younger" <mdy@slater-consulting.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE 
Discussion List:

The 150 MW limitation on ICAP eligibility should only apply to SCR resources
that would fall within the DEC cap.  Any SCR resource that is exempt should
not be limited in its ability to sell ICAP (I never meant to imply they
should).

As to whether the cap is enforceable or whether the NYISO will comply, it
seems the fastest way to have the exemption yanked is for the NYISO to not
comply with the DEC's wishes.

We can talk about this at the PRL meeting on Monday but ultimately this is
an issue for ICAP working group and possibly the NYSRC.

Subject: Re: 150 mW DEC Cap for "Emergency Exempt" for EDRP

We can flesh this discussion out next week, but from the outset, Mark's
and Roy's comments are overly simplistic and overly restrictive.

First of all, not all SCR resources are impacted by the DEC cap. Many
will now be forced to go the route of obtaining Registration or State
Facility status, either of which allows then to operate above the 150 MW
cap. Lacking any DEC-imposed limit, all such permitted facilities must
be allowed to sign up for full SCR value. Obviously, other SCR
resources, not tied to emergency generation are also unaffected and
cannot be limited.

Even with respect to the Centrally Dispatched Emergency Power Generating
Units (CDEPGs), as John Prunkl points out, it is ISO Operations staff
that will need to decide on a real-time basis which SCR units should be
called. Due to the locational nature of the EDRP calls, a unit called
one day, may or may not be needed the next. Only in the case where there
will always be a clear overlap should any consideration be given to
precluding an SCR resource from participating and even then, as with
generators, there is no guarantee that all SCR-certified units will be
there when called upon.

The proper approach is not to limit who can sign up for SCR, but to
decide what protocols will be used to allocate activations during
emergencies. SCR resources that get signed up, but cannot be called due
to the limit would be analogous to generating units that sell ICAP, but
cannot operate when needed due to air permit or manufacturer warrantee
limitations. I think this would mean a UCAP "hit" for future sales.

As a more fundamental matter, I do not believe that DEC's ill-advised
150 MW limit (which was not agreed to by the NYISO) is currently
enforceable as a practical matter.

Only the NYISO knows when the 150 MW cap is being approached and
therefore the ISO's failure to adhere to that limit should not be held
against the affected generators. Nevertheless, the DEC ruling appears to
revoke the CDEPG status of ALL emergency generators upon a finding that
the NYISO has violated the 150 MW limit.

The DEC Emergency Ruling is not enforceable on the NYISO, which does not
hold permits or exemptions regulated by DEC. If NYISO agrees to abide by
the 150 MW limitation it will apparently be because it volunteers to do
so. I am unaware that the ISO has so agreed.

Consider the following: NYISO is faced with an emergency situation where
the lights would go out in New York City with 150 MW of CDEPGs but could
stay on with 160 MW. I believe that the ISO operators might have no
choice but to order the 160 MW on and preserve reliability,
notwithstanding the DEC limitation.

By placing CDEPGs in the position to be penalized for actions over which
they have literally no knowledge, let alone control, DEC's action
currently forces all emergency generators to seek Registration or State
Facility Permits.

The only apparent alternative is that CDEPGs must be given ironclad
assurances in SOAS-approved Operating Manuals that operations staff can
NEVER call on more than 150 MW of CDEPGs at any given time. Even then,
it is unclear how the ISO can provide generators with conclusive
assurances that they will not find their emergency exempt status
revoked. CDEPGs may be forced to seek real-time certifications from the
NYISO at the time they are called that their activation will not exceed
the 150 MW limit.

I would be interested in the ISO's opinion on whether it can, and will,
limit activations of CDEPGs to less than 150 MW, no matter what the
circumstances.

We have received written approval from both the OCD and the NMED for the soil 
characterization plan that was submitted for sampling soil in the former 
surface impoundment area located at the northeast corner of the facility. A 
work plan for excavation and disposal of affected soil will be prepared 
subsequent to completion of the soil characterization plan. A tentative 
schedule is as follows:
? Meet with the Team and the contractor (Gandy) at the site on August 29th
? Collect soil samples for characterization on September 5th and 6th. Bill 
Olson with the OCD has indicated that he would like to be present for these 
activities.
? Receive lab results by September 21st
? Submit excavation work plan by October 5th

Whether or not we can complete the excavation work this year will be largely 
dependent upon obtaining a quick approval of an excavation work plan. The 
timing will be tight but it can be done.

I received a call this morning from Jaroslav "Jarda" Solc (701-777-5217). 
Jarda is a Senior Research Manager for the Groundwater Resource & Remediation 
Group at the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC). Jarda reports to 
Edward "Ed" Steadman, Associate Director for Research at the EERC. Norm 
Moreno with the POEP had contacted Ed, provided him with my name and number, 
and asked if Ed's organization would contact us in regard to the EERC 
providing some assistance to TW with remediation of PCB contamination at the 
Laguna site. 

I provided a brief description of site conditions and we then discussed 
alternative remediation methods. Based on the information I provided, Jarda 
agreed that continued monitoring seemed to be appropriate. Jarda also 
indicated that his group did not have any off-the-shelf type remediation 
technologies that would be applicable. I suggested to Jarda that his 
organization might still be of service to TW in our discussions with the 
Pueblo and the POEP as a third party opinion. Jarda said that he would 
discuss this with Ed and get back to me.

Larry,
Just thought that I would write to tell you that we  really enjoyed your 
visit. also, we just found out that my Dad passed away this  afternoon (Wed) 
at about 1:30 PM. I would have called but what is there to say.  At least he 
will not be in? pain any more. Apparantly they had just  finished lunch at 
their new house in Silver City when he just fell over in his  chair. Anyway 
we will be leaving in the morning as mother wants to have the  funeral on Sat 
in Hillsboro. I know you are busy so do not  even?consider?coming to the 
funeral.Anyway tell the kids? that  while we enjoyed seeing you, we ?really 
missed seeing them. Hope all is  well. If you need something we will have 
Jans cell (801) 362-1108. Give Teddy  and everyone our love.
Rick

Larry, just to keep you posted, Jon has returned from CS 3 and 4.  He did
not find anything of concern.  We are working on the survey report and
should have it to you next week to review.  Will you be out all week in the
chopper, or will you be back before the end of the week?  Either way, we
should have a report for you to review by Wednesday, Thursday at the latest.
Does anyone else need a copy?  Let us know.  Thanks,  Scott

John, to my knowledge there are no ciritical habitats at either site.  In
my previous life as a consultant I did a considerable amount of work with
ESA in NM and AZ and on reservation lands.  To add to this, the whole
disturbance issue of compressor station activities from 1967 (sta. 2) and
1959 (sta.3) would strongly support your supposition that there wont be any
surprises.  Ive spoken to Region IX EPA and this issue wont delay the
processing of the permits for either station.  I would think that from the
time the reports are completed to clearnace by the Navajo Nation, would be
about 30 days.  That is the approximate time limit  that the SHPO
clearances received.  Again, weve received verbal clearance from the Navajo
Nation at these sites regarding T&Es.  The project start point is station
2, so we have some room in the event the survey approvals take longer than
30 days, but I agree with you that we need to move this along.  Ill be more
than happy to motivate the Navajos and EPA after the reports are
submitted.....Scott Patti has promised me he would let me know when the
Navajos have said "yes" and he would charge into the field and do the
surveys.

Larry,
Please proceed with all haste on this.  How long to complete them and
submit the findings (can't believe there would be anything turn up).  No
endangered plants in any of those station yards - I trust?  The EPA is
reaching here, but they have the big stick and we must work through this to
get the air permit.  This is a lesson's learned for the upcoming Sun Devil
project.  John

     The issue arose when the EPA in San Francisco said they would not
     issue an air permit unless we had addressed all concerns relevant to
     the endangered species act, even on distsurbed lands at stations 3 and
     4.  Even though we had received a verbal approval formt he Navajo
     Nation that endangered species would not be a concern by the Nation,
     the EPA felt otherwise.  This means that they wont give us a permit
     until we do a survey for plants and animals.  Because ENSR was on the
     list of contractors approved by the Navajo Nation, they were given the
     opportunity.  As you know, I have been working with Scott Patti on
     this and we have worked it through.  All that is left is to get the
     ENSR renewal permit application approved by the Nation and ENSR is off
     and running to do the surveys.  Terry, I know that you know all this,
     I just wanted to keep John and Bill in the loop on how things are
     progressing......

     Larry,

     I understand from Scott Patti that the EPA has thrown a monkey wrench
     into
     the air permitting process for stations 3 and 4 and are now requesting
     endangered species surveys.  For simplicity, we will add this as a new
     task
     for the Red Rock Expansion project.  The FT. Collins folks are
     proceeding
     based on your verbal go ahead, but to make our accountants happy, I
     will
     have to get something written authorizing the additional work.  Scott
     is
     estimating the task to cost approximately $7,000.  Since I am listed
     as the
     project manager on paper, I will put together a brief letter and get
     it to
     you this week.  However, please continue to directly coordinate with
     Scott
     and he will keep me apprised of the status.

     Thanks,

     Terry.

Hey Guys,

We have been researching PJM transmission settlement and have found an 
inconsistency in how deals are settled in PJM and 
how they are getting into Enpower.

I would like to propose that any deal for transmission be entered into 
Enpower as documented below.  Please come to me if you 
have any questions.

Volume Management is attempted to set up a process to reconcile these volumes 
on a daily and monthly basis, so bear with us 
until the process is in place and everyone is up to speed.

Thanks,

Rebecca


PJM TRANSMISSION PROCEDURE

Every time an OASIS request is accepted in PJM a deal is entered into 
Enpower...  

 1)  with a demand volume equal to the amount reserved
 2)  demand price of $0.67
 3)  trans volume equal to the volume FLOWED (or expected to flow)
 4)  trans price of $0.48
 5) Comments with the PJM OASIS number for reference (buy and sell 
transaction ids if available)

Examples:

A) If EPMI reserve 100mw of transmission on peak for the whole month, but we 
are not sure if or when we are going to use it, enter 
demand volume of 100mw and trans volume of zero, and then when it is used 
change the trans volume in Scheduling to the amount 
that actually flowed.

B)  If EPMI reserves 50mw for HE8-12 and expects to use it, enter demand 
volume of 50mw and trans volume of 50mw, and then of it 
is cut change the trans volume in Scheduling to the amount that actually 
flowed.

Not only does this call into question the objectivity of such contracted

As a separate item to the concerns I had about the technical content, I was
a little confused on what was done here administratively. The last paragraph
says something about NYPA sharing the study. I didn't think they had
anything at all to say about it in the first place if it is an ISO work
product. If they do, could you explain why this is the case? If the ISO did
this, why wasn't this all posted on the OASIS at the same time NYPA got
this? The date on this shows a March 26 release.  Ignore these comments if
this was done, but I wasn't aware of this.

I am more than a little uncomfortable with a single market participant
having a month's lead time on ISO studies that can have significant
commercial impact. Think about the implications of this in the context of
people negotiating long term bi lateral ICAP agreements over the last month.
Depending on your take on the type of market changes that this type of
analysis might support, there could be enormous changes to the economics of
seasonal versus annual agreements, choice of equipment etc. This simply
isn't fair. Even if posted, this type of work by the ISO that can have large
potential commercial impacts should go out on all of the distributions at
the same time as release to anyone and OASIS posting.

Subject: NYPA study-Winter Locational ICAP requirements

At NYPA's request ISO staff conducted a limited analysis of
the winter locational ICAP requirements for Long Island and New York City
areas.  While such ICAP requirements have historically been set as a single
number for the entire year, it is NYPA's belief that this holdover from the
old way of doing business must be re-examined.  It is NYPA's belief that
most if not all of the contribution to loss of load risk occurs in the
summer months.  As such, some reduction in winter ICAP requirements should
be possible with no impact on the Loss of Load criterion of one day in ten
years.

NYPA requested that the ISO start with the database that
resulted in the locational requirements of 80% and 98% for New York City and
Long Island, respectively.   At NYPA's request the ISO modeled winter
ratings on the transmission interfaces into NYC and LI and determined how
much the 80% and 98% could be reduced in the winter before any impact on the
statewide Loss Of Load  occurred.  The report indicates that winter
requirements of 75% and 92% of the summer peak load resulted for NYC and LI,
respectively.

While this in no way reflects an exhaustive analysis of winter
locational requirements, the results from this study suggest that some
reduction in the winter         requirement may be warranted and a
consideration of seasonal requirements should be incorporated in future ICAP
requirement studies.   NYPA believes that       having an ICAP requirement
for summer and winter seasons based on the LSE's peak load for the
respective season would send the proper ICAP price signal.


NYPA is sharing the study results in the attached report in
an effort to begin a dialog which we hope will lead to a broader examination
of locational requirements when the issue is revisited again next year.  We
would appreciate hearing the views of other market participants.

As most of you are aware, a Consolidation Audit was performed at the NCL
FRACTIONATOR during the month of November 2000 by a selected ENRON group.
As a result of the audit, a task list was put together by the Audit Team,
which identifies names & completion dates that were assigned to each task
on the list.

Below is a file that has your name on it, this file has a list of Audit
Action Items that you are responsible to complete. You must complete, and
update me on each action item on or before it's assigned due date. You are
also responsible for ensuring that the proper documentation supporting the
completion of each action item is sent to me in a timely manner. If you
have any problems with achieving completion of an assigned action item, you
must report it to me as soon as possible. If you have any questions on
anything, please do not hesitate to contact me. The completion of these
items are extremely important and will require your full commitment. It is
extremely important for you to download your file and begin on it
immediately since some of the due dates are just around the corner. Some of
the items will be easily taken care of, while others will take a lot of
your time. Therefore, you will want to evaluate each item to identify how
long it will take you to complete it.

Thank you for all of your help in advance,

"Mark Younger" <mdy@slater-consulting.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE 
Discussion List:

Your discussion is based on a misunderstanding.  The $150 price is the
lowest point at which the AMP will check for whether there needs to be any
mitigation.  This price was picked to avoid the AMP running when it is
highly unlikely that any mitigation will in fact be needed.

The $150 price will not trigger mitigation in and of its.  Whenever one of
the zones has a price that is above $150 the AMP will run to determine if
any units have crossed the conduct threshold.  If there are any units that
have crossed the conduct threshold then those units will be set at their
reference bids and the market will be rerun to determine if the impact
threshold has been triggered.  If the impact threshold is triggered in any
zone then the final runs will be done with the mitigated (i.e. reference)
bids for those units that triggered the conduct threshold.  If the impact
threshold is not triggered then the original bids for all units will be
used.

"Kirkpatrick, Joe" <joe.kirkpatrick@nrgenergy.com> writes to the
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

The NYISO has chosen $150 as representative of a level to trigger market
mitigation. I believe the basis for this was a determination of a price
that was calculated to be representative of the statewide price of $50.
A 300% increase or an increase of $100 is $150, coincidently the same
price.

I am questioning the determination of this price ($50) and its
application in the market mitigation plan.

In determining market power according to the market mitigation plan
specific generator or unit bids are examined to identify economic
withholding. How does the $50 price reference a specific unit, I am not
sure where in the Market Mitigation Plan it says to examine the entire
statewide price and then compare it to a generator's bid.

If a generator's fuel costs (without fixed cost recovery) is $150 that
unit would presumably never bid below its cost, it would always bid as a
minimum $150. How could that generator exceed the thresholds identified
in the market mitigation plan. A 300% increase would be $450 and an
increase of $100 would be $250, and yet using the AMP interpretation of
the mitigation plan the threshold for identifying economic withholding
is $150.
It would seem that the AMP methodology is improperly applying the Market
Mitigation Plan. The Mitigation Plan is supposed to identify generator
conduct and clearly in the application of the AMP it is not.

The simple question would be is the $150 threshold representative of
every generator's bid to determine economic withholding. The answer can
only be no, how can it be?

The Market Mitigation Plan was intended to determine whether a generator
was exercising market power. The determination of whether a generator
was exercising market power would and should take into consideration all
of the prevalent market, unit and system conditions to determine if that
unit was in fact exercising market power. The more complex the system
the more complex the analysis of whether marker power was exercised.

How does a price trigger (or any automatic threshold) take all of the
complexities of a situation into account? It cannot, I suspect that is
why due process is required whether it is a court case or a market power
determination. The full facts are presented and evaluated, every case is
unique and requires deliberation and analysis of every supporting fact.
In other words automatic judgement is not an option and yet under the
NYISO AMP it is offered as a solution.


I do agree that prices should not be posted in the DAM if they are high
as a result of market power. A better solution would be to delay the
prices or hold them in reserve until a proper determination is made. In
the same way that prices are held in reserve for software flaws they
should be held in reserve for determination of market power. Prices can
be posted and flagged subject to change pending review of market power,
at least then due process can be followed. Market participants can be
consulted in accordance with the Plan and if required SCUC can be rerun.

External proxy bus prices may need to be frozen to ensure that flows are
consistent with the orginal DAM posting if a longer period of time is
required for market power evaluation. The AMP is still in place but is
only used to identify potential market power until a "human" evaluation
is done.

During the quarterly conference call with SoCal in which we discuss PCB costs 
on the SoCal system, for which Transwesten is 86% responsible, Ralph Komai, 
SoCal's PCB person provded some addtional information with respect to what is 
going on with the PCB activities on the SoCal system.  As a result of the 
PG&E press release, SoCal management directed additional sampling to be done 
at their interconnect with Transwestern and downstream of this interconnect.  
Ralph reported that a number of liquid samples came back at around 7 ppm, 
however one sample at their Kelso Station, near Barstow,  came back at 77 
ppm. 

Ralph had indicated that there has been an increase in the PCB's coming into 
their collection locations in the Needles area as evidenced by the following:

 Based upon 1997 data, almost no liquids greater than 50 ppm were revcovered

 Data collected in 1998 showed that approx. 8% of the liquids were greater 
than 50 ppm

 Data collected in 1999 showed that approx. 9% of the liquids were greater 
than 50 ppm

Based upon this, Ralph had stated that SoCal would be collecting additional 
sampling information and possibly entering into an internal montoring 
program, somewhat like PG&E is currently doing now.

I had informed Ralph that our Needles M/S facility had seen almost no liquids 
in the last 5 years, other than a recent accumulation of a one time pigging 
in early 2000 when a small volume of liquids (less than 55 gallons) had been 
collected.   We discussed that the accumulations seen on the SoCal system 
were probably from existing liquids on their system which had collected in 
low points in their pipeline and were moving downstream due to the increased 
flows from TW into SoCal.  

Ralph gave the impression that there were no immediate management tensions 
resulting from the recent "hits".  He just indicated that they would be 
watching their system and sampling at a more frequent basis.

The BS&P Subcommittee is scheduled to meet Monday, May 21, 2001 starting at
9:30 a.m. in conference room "WA" at the NYISO offices on Washington Ave.
in Albany.  A conference call number has also been set up as follows:

(601) 354-1086  Participant Code 616484

Our agenda will be as follows:

1.  Review Management Committee meeting of May 10, 2001 regarding the
proposed budget revision and action by the NYISO Board.

2.  Meet with Chuck King and review the details of the Market Services
Budget for 2001 and expectations for 2002.  We will also take advantage of
this opportunity to meet with Chuck to help us develop better 2002 goals
for customer service responsiveness.

3.  Review the comments received from market participants on the draft
goals we sent out to the tie list, and finalize a list of goals to serve as
input to the NYISO internal business planning process.



The BS&P Subcommittee is also scheduled to meet Tuesday, May 22, 2001
starting at 9:30 a.m. in conference room "WA" at the NYISO offices on
Washington Ave. in Albany.  A conference call number has also been set up
as follows:

(505) 242-2420  participant code 265727

As described in a previous e-mail, the purpose of this meeting is to review
the progress of the Credit Policy Working Group (CPWG) in developing a
comprehensive proposal to take to the Management Committee.  Based on
discussions of the CPWG this week, it does not appear a consensus proposal
to the BS&P will be achievable for this meeting, however, the CPWG, Andy
Ragogna, and I believe a detailed presentation to the full BS&P by NYISO
staff of the work accomplished to date, identification of open issues, and
a discussion of how to proceed is appropriate at this time given the
complexity of this issue.  In-person attendance at this meeting is
encouraged.

Flood Relief in Massive floods in recent weeks have devastated much of the

recover until well after next year. Food, 
 water, and shelter are all in extremely short supply.  Every bit of help can 
make a huge difference!

Arnold at ext. 55125. Donations to 
 the flood relief can be made to:

Last night I noticed that all of the clearing prices for power were coming in 
at the same as our bid on the 500 mws.  My belief that we were setting the 
price was confirmed when I resubmitted our bids for a couple of hours, and it 
once again printed our clearing price.  We may be the only people truly 
playing this market at night (at least with any size), so we may want to 
lower our offer the subsequent nights.

Larry,

Thank you for sending me a copy of the MOU between you and NWTF.  The RMEF,
while interested in working with you, will need more substance behind the
partnership and how we intended to work together.  I'm up to my neck in a
restructuring process through the end of the month or I would offer some
recommendations.

If you would like to take a crack at a draft MOU with specific details
associated with the partnership, I would be happy to review another draft.
In November, I should have a bit more time to spend on this opportunity.  If
you are simply looking for a local partnership to work on projects, I will
steer you to Alan or one of our local staff members in the region.

Again, thank you for the interest and I look forward to working with you on
a mutually beneficial partnership.

Dan

Randy, this is a short summary of the environmental findings that were 
identified during the records review conducted at the Corpus Christi Koch 
facility offices on May 1st and 2nd of this year.

All environmental records which were available in the file data room at the 
Koch office  were reviewed.  Assumptions were made that the environmental 
records were complete for all assets included in the sale.  Primary emphasis 
was placed on those environmental issues which are normally associated with a 
sale or purchase of assets dealing with distribution and transmission of 
crude oil. In particular, pipeline and tank farms were the most critical 
assets which were reviewed. 

Based upon the data review, the Koch assets were in compliance with the 
following:

  Air permitting, permit by rule, standard expemtions, recordkeeping and fee 
payments were documented 

  NSPS recordkeeping and inspections for VOC control on large crude oil tanks 
were documented 

  Oil Pollution Act-OPA 90 plans had been prepared and were up to date

  SARA compliance and reporting had been completed

  SPCC plans had been prepared for each site which qualified under 40 CFR 112

  Spill reporting history and notifications to the state agency were 
available for review

   There are ongoing groundwater and soil remediation activities at one site 
included in the asset for sale
     (permits for the remediation activity is in place)

  Hazardous waste notifications, annual reportings and fee payments were 
documented

Based upon the above review, there were no issues which could be identified 
which would be condsidered a major environmental limitation or would be a 
considered a major environmental  liability.  This statement is again based 
upon the assumption that all environmental information was present in the 
data room for the assets in question.  It should also be stated that this 
analysis of Koch's environmental compliance is based upon the fact that Koch 
has not held back or provided false or misleading information or knowledge 
during their presentation or informaiton contained in the facility files.

Pending further development and interest of this potential purchase, a 
recommendation is made to conduct a phase I due diligence and site visit to 
each location to verify findings from the records review.   Also, due to the 
past history of Koch's operating practices, it is recommended that contract 
conditions be implicitly stated that EOTT will not be held liable for 
discoveries of past deficiencies or releases of contamination which have 
occurred on any of the Koch assets purchased.

Subject:  Cancellation of May 1, 2001 BS&P call on credit policy

We previously agreed to hold a conference call meeting May 1 in
anticipation of having sufficient progress from the Credit Policy Working
Group (CPWG) to review.  After speaking with Andy Ragogna this afternoon, I
do not believe the CPWG is close enough to a detailed proposal to have a
productive conference, after all.  Consequently, I am canceling the May 1 
call.

Additionally, it appears unlikely at this point we will have a proposal
ready for the May 10 Management Committee  meeting. My report will simply
be a progress report on the Credit Policy issue, and a report on our plans
to develop this year's budget and goals recommendations.

Clarification of the Filing requirements :

Section 6-106 of the Energy Law of New York State

Each year certain loading-serving entities and generation providers are
required to file certain operating data with the New York State
Energy Planning Board under Section 6-106 of the Energy Law of
New York State.  The year 2001 filing deadline for this information
is July 1, 2001.  The NYISO will continue to function as reporting
agent for Market Participants.



ESCO's that neither generate nor distribute electricity are not required to
provide the Section 6-106 information.  It is assumed that the ESCO has a
process in place to convey their forecast inputs to the Transmission Owner(s).

For those New York Market Participants desiring to report this
operating information through the NYISO, please review the
attached document that describes the process for submitting data
to the NYISO.

As I hope all of you have heard by now, it was a very productive meeting with 
Nancy Wrona. The creative interpretations of the DEQ rules were not necessary 
as Jerry and Nancy hammered out a very date-specific sequence for the permit 
approval activities, as well as clarifying the facility-related activities he 
can do before actual permit issueance. Likely date for permit issuance is by 
Friday, November 16, but this will depend upon EPA cooperation in shortening 
its maximum time allowed for review and assuming no substantive public 
comments. Following is first draft of "thank-you" letter to Nancy from Jerry; 
edit freely:

HAND DELIVERY

Nancy Wrona
Director, Air Quality Division
3003 North Central Avenue, 5th floor
Phoenix, Arizona 85012

Re: Transwestern Pipeline, Permits No. 1001601 & 1001602
        Schedule for Permits Issuance

Dear Ms. Wrona;

Thank you again for your significant assistance in detailing a specific 
strategy to complete the process to review and approve the two permit 
revisions for the Transwestern Pipeline compressor stations near Kingman and 
Flagstaff. We were impressed with your willingness and ability to focus on 
the practical approach to improving Arizona's air quality as promptly as 
possible. Working with you and your team of Cathy O'Connell and Prabhat 
Barghava gave our team from Enron Transportation Services and Transwestern 
Pipeline Company (TWP) a strong sense of accomplishment and cooperation.

Following is the schedule that we detailed for subsequent activities:
1. By Friday morning, October 5, Prabhat and Shudeish Mahadev will have 
completed the draft permits; on Friday afternoon, October 5, the ADEQ team, 
including Prabhat and Cathy O'Connell, will conduct the internal review and 
the TSD; by close of business, Friday, October 5, ADEQ will email the draft 
permits revisions to the TWP team (Bill Kendrick, Larry Campbell and me; our 
contact numbers and email addresses are listed on the attached sheet).

2. On Tuesday morning, October 9, at 9 am Phoenix time, there will be a 
call-in conference call between the ADEQ and the TWP teams for final review, 
negotiation, and agreement on the terms and conditions of the draft permits 
revisions.

3. By Thursday, October 11, or Friday, October 12, ADEQ will do first 
publication in the daily newspapers in Mohave and Coconino Counties of the 
30-day public comment period and 30-day notice of a public hearing (at TWP's 
request) for both permits revisions in Williams AZ. Toward meeting the 
agreed-upon permits revisions schedule, TWP hereby requests a hearing on each 
revision pursuant to R18-2-330(E) and asks that ADEQ include the required 
notices of hearing in all notices of the public's opportunity to comment 
pursuant to R18-2-330(C) and ARS sec 49-444(A). Second publication will occur 
a week later. We will research and confirm the mechanics for getting the 
notices published as soon as possible after the Tuesday, October 9 conference 
call; ADEQ will promptly prepare the form of notice, unless you wish TWP to 
do it.

4. On Tuesday, November 13, ADEQ will conduct the public hearing on the two 
permit revisions in Williams AZ. We have found nothing in the statutes or 
rules that would prevent having back-to-back hearings for the Kingman and 
Flagstaff facilities' permits revisions in the same place.

5. Promptly after the October 9 conference call that finalizes the draft 
permits revisions, ADEQ will send the drafts to EPA Region IX to commence 
EPA's review. TWP will confer with the EPA contacts to shorten the maximum 45 
days allowed so that EPA will complete its review on or before Thursday, 
November 15; EPA will promptly notify ADEQ of its approval.

6. On the assumption that neither the public hearing nor the EPA review 
generated any substantive comments that require further review, ADEQ will 
issue the permits revisions by Friday, November 16.

We recognize that the foregoing schedule will require significant cooperation 
among all parties, as well as working closely with EPA, but we are confident, 
based upon yesterday's meeting, that all of us from ADEQ and from TWP are 
committed to making this doable schedule work. The TWP team will promptly 
convey to ADEQ all materials it receives relating to the EPA permits 
revisions for the Leupp and Klagetoh facilities.

We also appreciated your clarification of the facilities-related activities 
that we can proceed with prior to final permits issuance. Specifically, since 
there will be no emissions impacts from the routine maintenance of replacing 
equipment and making the srubbers' tie-ins, TWP can proceed with those 
activities at the Kingman and Flagstaff sites. Additionally, we can proceed 
with the off-site fabrication of piping.

We also understand that, at the time of the first newspaper notices, we will 
post the appropriate signs at each facility duplicating the newspaper notices.

Again, thank you very much for your assistance in setting up the foregoing 
schedule and procedures. It is a real pleasure working together to improve 
Arizona's air quality.

Sincerely yours,

Jerry D. Martin

A presentation was given to the Transwestern Marketing Group in Houston over 
the PCB issues affecting sales of natural gas into western markets.  The 
history and future potential impacts of market stratgies were also discussed.

A training session on the Dehy MACT was attended in Santa Fe which was 
sponsored by the state of New Mexico, apprising companies of forth coming 
requirements under Title III.  A request will be sent out ot the field for 
each location which has dehydration to complete a extended gas analysis and 
rich lean glycol samples.  Notification to the staes and EPA is due by June 
17, 2000.

A conference call was attended to discuss the C/S 8 turbine project and its 
fate.  Based upon submitted discussions it was decided to dispose of the 
turbine, compressor and auxillary box as a PCB contaminated waste and move 
the contaminated articles to a PCB landfill.

The quarterly Transwestern/SoCal PCB management committee mtg was held via 
conference call.  Invoices and charges were discussed which So
cal had charged to their management and handling of PCB's on their system.  
At 86%, Transwestern's responsibility was $71,208.61.

Clearances were received from the F&W and SHPO for the additional areas for 
the powerline transmission corridor of the Gallup C/S which is in progress.

A custom fuel monitoring request wqas submitted to Region VI EPA for the 
Transwestern Lone Star Valero C/S.

Installation and testing has been initiated on the precombustion chambers for 
the Superiors at the Atoka No. 3 C/S.   While fabrication is in progress for 
the correct chamber,  temporary Waukesha chambers were installed.  Even 
though the chambers were not of the correct size and configuration, a 12.5% 
fuel savings was achieved and emissions were reduced by over 56%.  The 
correct chambers will be available and installed sometime next week.

Dear Market Participants,

It has been brought to our attention that a mistake was made on the Bid Form 
for
ICAP Auctions.  A corrected version of the Bid Form will be posted to the 
NYISO
Website as soon as possible.  The description for entering the dollars per
kilowatt hour incorrectly states per 6 months on the Monthly Auction sheets.
Please enter dollars per kilowatt per 1 month.

On April 24, 2001, the NYISO deployed code changes affecting Class 1 PURPA
transactions in the billing system and modified bid status flagging in the
MIS.  These changes impacted settlements for 4/10, 4/11, 4/13, and 4/18 -
forward.

There was a code design problem with the PURPA code change that resulted in
an error in the computation of balancing energy for some class 1 units that
resulted in their purchasing their entire day-ahead schedules in the
balancing market.  There was also an oversight in the implementation of the
modified bid status flagging in the MIS such that those bids were not
transferred into the billing system, impacting bid production cost
guarantee settlements for the units with a modified bid status.

The NYISO will be posting supplemental invoices for April 2001 settlements
by 2300, today, Tuesday, May 15th to adjust for the aforementioned issues.
Funds due the NYISO for this supplemental invoice should be transferred
into the NYISO Clearing Account by close of business Wednesday, May 23,
2001.  Funds due Market Participants from the NYISO for this supplemental
invoice will be transferred into Market Participant accounts by close of
business Friday, May 25, 2001.

PLEASE NOTE THAT: Funds due the NYISO for the April 2001 settlements which
were invoiced on May 7, 2001 should be transferred into the NYISO Clearing
Account by close of business Wednesday, May 16, 2001, as scheduled.  Funds
due Market Participants from the NYISO for the April 2001 settlements
invoiced on May 7, 2001 will be transferred into Market Participant
accounts by close of business Monday, May 21, 2001, as scheduled.

Please be aware that as per the ISO Services Tariff any disputed amounts
are to be paid in full.  Upon resolution of the dispute, if it is
determined that an overpayment has been made by the Customer, a refund,
with interest, will be made by the ISO


In order to reconcile customer invoices for the supplemental April 2001
invoice, it will be necessary to net the following versions of the daily

After reveiwing the documents entitled, "Baseline Environmental Investigation 
of Arco North Coles Levee Plant 8, Rogas Loading Facility and Associated 
Natural Gas Pipeline Systems Kern County, California" and "Report of 
Preliminary Asessment Sampling North Coles Levee Gas Plant Loading Rack Area 
Tupman, California", it appears that the following areas should be 
investigated further to detemine horizontal and vertical extent of  
identified contamination from the above referenced reports:

 Tank 15 area-  total petroleum hydrocarbons

 Glycol reboiler area- total petroleum hydrocarbons

 Hot oil heater area- total petroleum hydrocarbons

   Wash rack area- lead

 Propane comp. area lead  
    total petroleum hydrocarbons
    chromates

 Cooling tower area- chromates

 Compressor area- BTEX
    chromates
    lead

In the "Baseline Environmental Investigation" report, sampling was only 
conducted to an approximate depth of 2.5'.  I am not comfortable with basing 
decisions for further investigations on such a shallow depth, in leau of the 
fact that  many times water soluble constituents may horizonatlly move 
vertically from surface shallow depths into the lower subsurface areas.  This 
is indeed the case for chromates.  I based my recommendations for metal 
concentrations on the federal RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste target levels 
for metals and evaluated  the TPH and BTEX levels with the  underground 
storage tank guidlines for California.  There were references to a 1989 
document in the "Baseline" report for specific parameters, but there may have 
been an update to target contamination level requirements since that date and 
therefore, I used 10,000 ppm which is a general action level for most states 
for total petroleum hydrocarbons.  Again, I did not evaluate the mercury or 
the loading rack issues.

One last issue.  As you know, identification of contamination is usually 
accomplished by sight observations of visible contamination, knowledge of 
processes and or history.  Report results of the surface contamination do not 
show there to be an immediate environmental concern.  Due to the age of the 
facility, there may be concerns which were not identified in the reports.  
However, based upon the locations of the preliminary samplings which were 
conducted throughout the facility, it appears that the information presented 
in the reports would be adequate to address suspected contamination at the 
facility.

Subject: New Options Model

Meeting on May 30 at 3:30pm regarding the new Option Model we (Steve Wang, 
Harry Arora, and Rob Stalford) use to make markets.  The old structuring 
model was created for marketer to give indicative pricing.  I have created 
this model especially for option market making.  As market makers we found 
the old model too slow as we are often making bid/offers in more than five 
strikes in more than five different months.  This model allows us to make our 
markets quicker and identify mispricings in the market before our 
competitors.  This is not to replace the old structuring model.  It is only a 
complement that will give everyone a better picture of where options are 
trading and where bid/offers are.  We will publish these prices weekly and 
will eventually have them on a daily basis.

Steve Fernand's comments on the recent ICAP deficiency auction results are
based upon a fundamental misunderstanding of the ICAP market.  This
misunderstanding is summarized in his statement that "Unlike the electric
commodity, there have been no significant changes in the underlying costs
for suppliers of ICAP."  Since last summer there have been very significant
changes in the factors that affect the ICAP markets in New York.

The basic principle of the ICAP market is that it provides the generator (or
external ICAP provider) a mechanism to recover costs that are not adequately
recovered from the energy market.  In return for this revenue the generator
accepts an obligation to bid into the NYISO day-ahead energy market every
day that the generator is not out of service due to either maintenance or
forced outage.

The basic theory on developing a bid into the ICAP market for an internal
generator is that the generator should estimate the total revenue it
requires from the ICAP market to continue operating. This calculation is
based upon its total cost of remaining in business less its expected profits
from the energy market (expected revenues less expected fuel costs).  For
external suppliers the ICAP bid is based upon the opportunity cost of being
obligated to the New York energy market rather than being either obligated
to another market or having no obligations to any market.

Clearly, in each case, the bid into the capacity market is dependent upon
the expectations of the New York energy market.  There have been several
adopted and proposed changes in the New York energy markets that make them
both less desirable than last year and less desirable than the energy
markets surrounding New York.  These include:

The Circuit Breaker/AMP - The Circuit Breaker/AMP creates both a concern
that the day-ahead market prices will be depressed from the levels that
should exist.  The implementation of the circuit breaker raises concerns
that the market prices in New York energy price will be depressed.  The
potential ways in which the DAM prices could be depressed include failure to
incorporate changing unit operating parameters, fuel costs, or emissions
costs.  Additionally, while opportunity costs are a part of an acceptable
bid, there is no methodology to keep the circuit breaker from effectively
removing the opportunity costs for a circuit broken bid.  Finally, the
design of the circuit breaker may result in numerous individual bids by
different market participants being circuit broken when they are not
exercises of market power.  Every time a bid is improperly circuit broken it
affects all sellers because all sellers end up being paid less in the DAM
then they should have received.

In addition to these questions about whether the AMP will improperly depress
prices, there is still uncertainty to how  a generator that has been
improperly mitigated is supposed to be able to be compensated.  This was
part of the original circuit breaker design but as of this point the NYISO
has failed to provide any description of how this process will work.  There
is also uncertainty about the reference prices and the process that
generators will follow in getting changes or exceptions to the reference
prices accepted.  The uncertainty raises the cost of being obligated to the
New York market.

Price Capped Load Bidding - The price capped load bidding mechanism that is
being implemented this summer provides a sophisticated tool to a small
subset of market participants to determine whether they want to purchase at
the DAM market prices.  This provides the possibility that day-ahead market
prices will systematically be depressed relative to the real time market if
this mechanism is abused.  Virtual load bidding has been blocked for the
summer.  If virtual load bidding were implemented it would provide a
potential check on this market manipulating behavior.  The only check
allowed in our market design is the inclusion of opportunity costs in the
generator day-ahead market bids.  As addressed above, the application of the
Circuit Breaker/AMP is likely to impede the generators including opportunity
costs in their bids thereby eliminating the only check on using the price
capped load bids to manipulate the market.

Penalty and Public Disclosure Proposal -  This proposal will penalize market
participants that are mitigated for exceeding the NYISO Market Mitigation
Measures. There have been issues raised related to this proposal regarding
due process and fundamental fairness.  The penalties only apply to
generators and other suppliers.  The penalty is not based upon a
determination that the market participant has exercised market power.
Finally, the ADR process can determine whether mitigation was properly
applied by the NYISO but cannot determine whether the penalty that was
applied was appropriate.

Each of the above measures has resulted in a potential reduction in energy
market revenues and added significant uncertainty to the New York market.
The above price control measures are not in place in the surrounding
markets.  Each of these makes the New York market less desirable than its
neighbors and raises the price of being obligated to the New York market.
Interestingly, the Penalty and Public Disclosure Proposal was approved by
the NYISO Management Committee between the ICAP Monthly auction and the ICAP
Deficiency auction.

The above are not the only price control proposals that have been made for
the NYISO energy market.  Most notably, there have been proposals for $150
price caps in the energy market and retroactive price authority.
Fortunately, both of these ill-considered proposals were ultimately
withdrawn.  However, the mere fact that they were proposed inflicts
uncertainty on the energy market and therefore increases the expected prices
in the ICAP market.

Two final points need to be clarified regarding Mr. Fernand's argument that
the results of the auction indicate a problem.  First, he lists the change
in ICAP market clearing prices between last year and this year as indicating
there is a problem in the ICAP markets.  When generators bid into last
summer's auction they had not yet experienced summer operation under the
NYISO markets. There also had not been the broad range of price control
measures proposed and adopted for this summer.  Compared to last summer,
ICAP bids for this summer would have incorporated better understanding of
the expected profits in the energy market as well the expected impacts of
the price control measures.  Second, he also uses the results of this
summer's strip/monthly auction and the deficiency auction as an indication
of there being problems in the ICAP market.  Because the entire ICAP
requirement is not cleared in a single auction, the prices that are bid into
the earlier auctions are essentially an ICAP providers estimate of its
opportunity cost of selling in the earlier auction rather than selling in a
later auction.  This requires the ICAP providers to guess the likely bids of
the marginal ICAP providers.  The results of this years auctions merely
indicate that those who sold in the early auctions apparently did not do a
very good job of guessing the lost revenue associated with selling in the
earlier auctions.

Mr. Fernand's provides a set of proposed measures for addressing the ICAP
issue.  If any of them are worthy of be considered then they should be aired
through the committee process.  Nonetheless, one of the proposals should be
killed at the outset.  Because being an ICAP provider to New York includes
an obligation to bid into the energy market, no ICAP owners should ever be
"automatically bid into the Deficiency Auction" or any other auction.  Mr.
Fernand's suggests that that the automatic bidding requirement be relieved
if a Long ICAP Owner exclude itself.  The act of choosing not to bid into
the ICAP auction is in itself an indication that the ICAP provider has
chosen to exclude itself.

Hi Larry,

We haven't heard from you for a while and wanted to check back with you.  
Have you made a purchase yet?  If so, we would appreciate a reply to this

will be happy with for years to come.  Remember, since we don't own these 
stones, we are your personal diamonds consultants who will work to find the 
very best diamond for you at a great price.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take

suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always want 
to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and 
answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165.

Project update







Follow up items from Kevin Hyatt

Q: What are the Btu restrictions of gas being delivered to major California
pipelines?

A:  TW's tariff calls for minimum 970 Btu's per cubic foot.  There is no
maximum Btu value specified.  The other qualification calls for " no
hydrocarbons in liquid form at the temperature and pressure at which the
gas is delivered into Transporter's pipeline system."  TW's contract spec
with SoCal reads the same way.  I could find no contract spec for the PG&E
or Mojave contracts so the default is TW's tariff.

Q: Have any Calif. LDC's done any NGL peaking injection in the past?

A: I spoke with Mike O'Donnell, Director of Gas System Operations for PG&E.
He recalls PG&E having some peaking equipment using NGL's on their system
10 - 15 years ago but nothing recent.  They had a vaporizer (maybe several)
situated on the lines as they came into San Francisco.  He also recalled a
vaporizer on a line that served a large electric power plant.
Interestingly enough, a Canadian outfit had called him recently asking the
same questions.  Mike indicated they would be interested in talking more
about the idea as we get further along

That's all for now, let me know if you have questions.

Subject: Error in MDEA in P&L application

Rao,
The P&L application has a error in it.  Discrepancies are occuring on the 
location of MDEA deal information within the P&L application.  

Deals entered on the hourly tabs on the sheet labled "MDEA-SVCE" are not all 
appearing on the sheet labeled "Checkout".  Alternatively, some deals 
appearing on the "checkout" sheet are not apppearing on the hourly tabs.  
Please take a look at this and make whatever corrections are necessary.

Based on the call from Rod Boschee today noting meetings set up with 
Southwest, Lou and Larry Campbell will be attending. I believe it would be 
helpful for Dave Schafer or a rep from communications to attend, as well. 
PG&E appears to be getting ready to divert attention to us. Worthwhile to 
read the PG&E media statement at the end of this lotus notes. Mike

FYI - it also appears that there is a meeting next tuesday in Vegas with SW 
Gas and SoCal.   They will have PG&E media folks ther to discuss possible 
public distribuion of some type of notice concerning this matter.

Dave Schafer (VP of HR and Media) is unavailable so I would suggest that 
Larry, myself and possibly someone from market - Lorraine??? - also attend.

please see the attached.   Comments???  I doubt that PG&E would make any 
changes.  I'd still like to make some suggestions.  Dave - it might be 
worthwile to speak to your counterpart who appear to be Jon Tremayne.   At 
least we have a heads up on thier response.  I'll review our last Q&A and 
send the comments to Dave.

Lou --

Attached is the current version of our Standby statement (i.e., statement to
read to media, in the event they "call").


 <<000207s2.doc>>

To date, and through history of our gas quality matters betw. TW and PG&E,
we have had no calls, and therefore, we have NOT externally utilized this
statement.

We (you and I) should chat this PM or tomorrow Friday, re any developments.

Cheers!

Dave, 415-973-6659

(I am cc'ing Rod and Jon Tremayne of our News Dept.)

MAPP OASIS WILL BE DOWN TONIGHT, for 1 HOUR!

Dear MAPP Transmission Providers and Customers,

On Wednesday, May 16th at 11:30pm CDT the MAPP OASIS NODE will be taken
off-line for approximately 1 hour for database maintenance.  At the same
time the latest version of OASIS software will be installed , v2.7.0d.

How does this effect MAPP Transmission Providers:

The new version of OASIS software allows for specific redirect service
types.  Two new option fields have been added to the service types, "Allow
on Redirect" and "Account on Reduction".

These two fields can be changed by selecting "Transmission Services" under
Provider Maintenance, and then click on the ID to update the transmission
service.

The "Allow on Redirect" option determines whether the service type appears
in the drop down box on the REDIRECT transmission request template.

The "Account On Reduction" determines whether REDIRECT request types appear
in the "Query for Reductions".

All services types will default to "No" for
the two new fields for existing transmission services.

Requirements:
Before the upgrade
1.  All "Capacity Type" entries must be unique for each transmission
provider.  Please change your "Capacity Types" so that they are unique.

 The "Capacity Type" will be changed by the MAPPCOR staff at the time of
upgrade if the unique "Capacity Type" for each provider is violated.

After the upgrade
1.  If you do have Redirect transmission service types then select "Yes" for
the "Allow on Redirect" field.

The MAPP OASIS Test node is available for testing version 2.7.0d.  The test
node can be accessed at:
http://mappb3.oasis.mapp.org/OASIS14/NODE/MAPPB3

How does this effect MAPP Schedule F Customers:

MAPP Schedule F Transmission Customers should select "HNF Secondary" as the
Service for redirecting a CONFIRMED MAPP Schedule F Firm reservation as
Non-Firm.

In addition, to redirect a CONFIRMED MAPP Schedule F Firm
reservation on Firm basis then one of the following services should be
selected "FCTS Daily", "FCTS Weekly", "FCTS Monthly", "FCTS Seasonal", "FCTS
Yearly", and "FCTS Monthly 1 Month" depending on the remaining duration.

Please try to have your business needs concluded prior to this outage.  We
apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

Please contact the MAPP Transaction Coordinator if you have further
questions at 651.632.8508 or at transcoords@mapp.org.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

MAPP Transaction Coordinator

NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Mark

Thanks for the clarification, regardless of what triggers mitigation it
is still an automated process that bypasses due process. System, unit
and market conditions are dynamic and therefore the circumstances to
determine market power are dynamic, you would assume that they are
fixed. Reference prices are dynamic based on many of the complexities of
the system. As a simple example I would offer gas basis as a complexity
that is not even taken into consideration.
Gas basis can have the result of increasing costs to a generator by as
an example $20/MMbtu, who at the NYISO is monitoring this on an hourly
basis?

If the most expensive unit on the system is given a reference price of
$150 what would be the highest clearing price you would expect to see
that would be set by an internal generator?

Since the NYISO reference bids for generators involved approximately
zero discussion with generators would you consider that following the
Market Mitigation Plan?

The default reference price for a generator's energy is based on
recently accepted bids for energy from that generator. In the event that
such data are unavailable a default reference price is either(1) by
negotiation with the generator, or (2) by an estimate of cost.

What defines an accepted bid? Is it the dispatch of a generator with
payment being either its bid or the LBMP price at the bus whichever is
higher. This is not clear to me.
What happened to the negotiation part?

In training material provided by the NYISO they clarify that a generator
must include all of its costs in its bid to ensure cost recovery, part
of those costs are fixed cost recovery. None of the default reference
bids assigned by the NYISO include any these costs.


Thanks

Joe

Your discussion is based on a misunderstanding.  The $150 price is the
lowest point at which the AMP will check for whether there needs to be
any
mitigation.  This price was picked to avoid the AMP running when it is
highly unlikely that any mitigation will in fact be needed.

The $150 price will not trigger mitigation in and of its.  Whenever one
of
the zones has a price that is above $150 the AMP will run to determine
if
any units have crossed the conduct threshold.  If there are any units
that
have crossed the conduct threshold then those units will be set at their
reference bids and the market will be rerun to determine if the impact
threshold has been triggered.  If the impact threshold is triggered in
any
zone then the final runs will be done with the mitigated (i.e.
reference)
bids for those units that triggered the conduct threshold.  If the
impact
threshold is not triggered then the original bids for all units will be
used.

"Kirkpatrick, Joe" <joe.kirkpatrick@nrgenergy.com> writes to the
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

The NYISO has chosen $150 as representative of a level to trigger market
mitigation. I believe the basis for this was a determination of a price
that was calculated to be representative of the statewide price of $50.
A 300% increase or an increase of $100 is $150, coincidently the same
price.

I am questioning the determination of this price ($50) and its
application in the market mitigation plan.

In determining market power according to the market mitigation plan
specific generator or unit bids are examined to identify economic
withholding. How does the $50 price reference a specific unit, I am not
sure where in the Market Mitigation Plan it says to examine the entire
statewide price and then compare it to a generator's bid.

If a generator's fuel costs (without fixed cost recovery) is $150 that
unit would presumably never bid below its cost, it would always bid as a
minimum $150. How could that generator exceed the thresholds identified
in the market mitigation plan. A 300% increase would be $450 and an
increase of $100 would be $250, and yet using the AMP interpretation of
the mitigation plan the threshold for identifying economic withholding
is $150.
It would seem that the AMP methodology is improperly applying the Market
Mitigation Plan. The Mitigation Plan is supposed to identify generator
conduct and clearly in the application of the AMP it is not.

The simple question would be is the $150 threshold representative of
every generator's bid to determine economic withholding. The answer can
only be no, how can it be?

The Market Mitigation Plan was intended to determine whether a generator
was exercising market power. The determination of whether a generator
was exercising market power would and should take into consideration all
of the prevalent market, unit and system conditions to determine if that
unit was in fact exercising market power. The more complex the system
the more complex the analysis of whether marker power was exercised.

How does a price trigger (or any automatic threshold) take all of the
complexities of a situation into account? It cannot, I suspect that is
why due process is required whether it is a court case or a market power
determination. The full facts are presented and evaluated, every case is
unique and requires deliberation and analysis of every supporting fact.
In other words automatic judgement is not an option and yet under the
NYISO AMP it is offered as a solution.


I do agree that prices should not be posted in the DAM if they are high
as a result of market power. A better solution would be to delay the
prices or hold them in reserve until a proper determination is made. In
the same way that prices are held in reserve for software flaws they
should be held in reserve for determination of market power. Prices can
be posted and flagged subject to change pending review of market power,
at least then due process can be followed. Market participants can be
consulted in accordance with the Plan and if required SCUC can be rerun.

External proxy bus prices may need to be frozen to ensure that flows are
consistent with the orginal DAM posting if a longer period of time is
required for market power evaluation. The AMP is still in place but is
only used to identify potential market power until a "human" evaluation
is done.

"Mark Younger" <mdy@slater-consulting.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE 
Discussion List:

If only 150 MW can be called on when the NYISO needs them then no more than
150 MW should be allowed to qualify as ICAP providers.  The purpose of ICAP
is to assure that the NYISO has capacity when it needs it.  "Having" the
capacity and then not being allowed to use it makes the capacity worthless.
Resources that cannot be called upon are do not add to system security.

Larry:

A couple of comments:

1. I recommend that the 150 MW limit be managed by NYISO Operations.  They
are going to understand the problems in real time and should have complete
authority of which generators get run based on the situation. Trying to
fairly rotate which units get called at this late date, given the hours of
operation are completely unknown would be a waste of time, in my opinion.

2. We all should be very grateful that the DEC has taken the action they
have on expanding the exempt generator definition.  If people are not happy
with the 150MW cap then they should get a registration or state facility
permit and notify the ISO that the their site is not to be counted in the
150 MW cap calculation.

3. Not paying full ICAP for these resources would be a disaster.  If we want
to kill the emergency program, this is the best way to do it.  Again,
calling of generators should be based on the NYISO Operations assessment of
the emergency situation.  A special case resource generator standing ready
to serve, even if DEC has placed some limits on the number of MW running at
one time, should not be penalized by this cap.  We may find situations where
some of the SCR "exempt" generators called can not start or limit their
generation hours for some reason.  In this case we need as many SCR
resources ready to fill the void as possible. Limit payments really hurts
the credibility and effectiveness of the programs we have all worked so hard
to develop.

4. I do not think the EDRP manuals need to say anything on this subject.
This should strictly be an internal NYISO operation matter on which
generators get called in each zone.  If the Operations manual needs to be
updated to reflect the 150 MW exempt generator class of EDRP generators lets
do it here not in the EDRP manual.

Looking forward to Monday's discussion. Have a great weekend.

Subject: 150 mW DEC Cap for "Emergency Exempt" for EDRP

Colleagues,
This is a "heads up" that there are several issues we will need to look at
on Monday with respect to the new NYS DEC expanded definition of "emergency
exempt" when participating in the EDRP.  The problems needing solving that I
am aware of so far concern the 150 mW cap that DEC placed on the ISO's call
for emergency customer generation.  Our understanding is that more than that
amount can be signed up for the program--but only 150 mWs can be called at
any one time.

Some have suggested that the DEC does not have the right or power to
regulate the NYISO.  I don't know.  But I do know that DEC would revoke this
in heart-beat if they thought we were going to ignore it--especially after
all these different parties, including the ISO and the self-generation
developers, bargained with NYS DEC to do what they have done.  Also, the
individual participating customers would be more than some upset if they
found out that DEC was revoking their emergency exempt status because they
were deemed to have been the ones who were over the 150 mW limit in an
emergency call.

There are two problems that I have seen, both related to enrolling more than
150 mWs of emergency exempt EDRP participants.  First, if there is more than
150 mWs in the region being called, we need to determine a method for who
gets called--it could rotate in an equitable fashion.  But our manual should
probably speak to this.

The other problem is that we probably shouldn't be paying full ICAP to 300
mWs of emergency exempt EDRP participants if we know that no more than half
of them can respond to any ICAP call.  We might derate them in percentage to
the subscription over the 150 mWs.  Or some other system.

My purpose here is to alert you to the issue and suggest that we want to
come up with a solution on Monday.  I spoke with Mollie Lampi about it and
hope the ISO has a chance to work on it today.  We want all EDRP and DADRP
manual matters to go before the BIC on May 24th.

Have a great weekend and thanks for all of the creative thinking and
constructive participation on getting these programs as right as we can as
quickly as we can!

Larry

marketrelations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants,

As many of you know, and as some of you have commented about, the
ISO performed additional computer analysis regarding locational ICAP
requirements at NYPA's request early this year.  We did so after
agreeing that the issue NYPA raised was relevant to our market and
would not detract from other work we were conducting.  The results
were shared with NYPA in March with the understanding that NYPA
would use the study results to promote a dialogue among Market
Participants on the issues raised.

The NYISO would like to formalize the process of contract work on
issues relevant to the New York market, or decide to discontinue it,
by reviewing with Market Participants a proposed protocol indicating
appropriate areas for study and appropriate disclosure guidelines.
We will request the Operating, Business Issues and Management
Committee Chairs to add this proposed protocol, for discussion, to
committee agendas for May.   We look forward to working with all
Market Participants on reaching agreement on an acceptable process
that is both useful and fair to everyone.

Regards,

Mollie Lampi,
NYISO Senior Attorney

The State of New Mexico conducted a surprise air inspection of the TW Atoka 
No.3 C/S.  The agency found no non compliance issues or violoations during 
the inspection.

The second quarter Transwestern/SoCal PCB management committee meeting was 
held this week.  Transwestern's share of the PCB management and disposal 
activities on the SoCal system for the quarter was $125,950.00.

The State of New Mexico has issued the settlement penalty for the turbine 
replacement issue at the P-1 C/S.  The original amount levied against 
Transwestern in 1997  was $14,700.  After the Air Quality Bureau sat on this 
issue for more than 4 years without resolution, they reassessed the penalty

Larry,
I have the State Rec Board and Kern County encroachment permit application
materials together. I also have the ACOE - 404 and RWQCB 401 information
ready for your review. You should receive all the packages tomorrow by
Fed-Ex.

I will e-mail the cover letters for you to modify as necessary and put on
your letterhead. I haven't formatted any headers or footers, as I assumed
you would have your own format style.

I need your input on a couple of questions/comments in order to finalize
things.

1) I have been listing the applicant as EOTT Energy Operating Limited
Partnership. Should I continue to list EOTT as the applicant, or should we
use Enron Transportation Services? I understand that the pipeline operator
will be Enron Pipeline Services Co.

2) Who should the local contact be? I've been using Kenny Maltby primarily
because Gary Fuller is gone, and Kenny knew what was happening from a
construction scheduling standpoint. Kenny now says that Scott Jones at the
North Coles Levee Gas Plant might possibly be the local contact. Or should
we use your name and office, as you may want to take the lead on dealing
with these agencies? Also, some of these applications/documents allow for an
agent (such as myself), but we may have to have signed authorizations in
order to do so.

3) It is my understanding that part of the overall Rogas project involves
the abandonment of an existing pipeline which travels in a separate location
through Kern Water Agency's groundwater recharge area. We may want to
address this in our application materials and get approvals as part of this
project, even though the active line may not be abandoned until a later
date. This line crosses the same bypass channel, and Kenny informed me that
they have an agreement with West Kern Water that they will remove all
abandoned lines unless they are in an "environmentally sensitive" area. This
allows you the option of capping the line on either side of the bypass
channel and leaving it in place. We would probably need the water district's
approval on this. If so, then we don't need to approach the ACOE, DFG,
RWQCB, State Reclamation Board, etc. Just something to consider. If we do
need to pull the abandoned line, we would have to go back to all these
agencies and get approvals again, pay fees, etc.

Call me to discuss at (805) 644-7976 or reply by e-mail. Thanks.

Alert Posted: 11:00 AM December 1, 2000: Demand Mismatch Order Notice
Effective Sunday, December 3, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., and until further notice, 
AGLC is issuing a Demand Mismatch Order for ALL Primary Pools.
Based on the current supply levels and expected demand levels, AGLC's system 
cannot manage the potential excess demand and the operational integrity of 
the system will be threatened. Therefore, it is essential that your 
interruptible customer's demand does not exceed the scheduled supply for your 
interruptible market for each primary pool under the demand mismatch order.
Each shipper/pooler/marketer is responsible for contacting their 
interruptible customers to curtail demand if necessary to meet this order. 
Marketers/Poolers are responsible for maintaining interruptible customer 
contact information. Any customer contact information in GOS is for AGLC 
internal use and is not intended to be marketers/poolers point of contact for 
curtailments.

every box set in our Music store (that's thousands of them) will be
on sale at prices up to 30% off the list price.

Box sets make a great gift for music lovers, but with so many titles
to choose from, it isn't easy to know what to buy. That's where we can
help. To help you sift through the many choices, we've created a list
of our most popular box sets. Featuring artists like The Eagles, Elton
John, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Marley, Miles Davis, and others, it's a pretty
impressive list--and, at up to 30% off, the prices can't be beat. To

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/125730/

If you don't find what you're looking for on this list, don't worry.
We've got an entire Box Sets Store packed with thousands of box sets
in every style of music. (If you come across a box set you just have
to have for yourself, we won't tell.) To check out our Box Sets

 Good seeing you again.  As I mentioned yesterday, I am sending you a copy of 
the Conservation Easement that has been granted to Cal Dept of Fish and Game 
over the NCL property.  I would appreciate if you could get a copy to John 
Schaefer (I couldn't find him in the Enron directory).

 As you will see, the Conservation Easement references the State Endangered 
Species Take Permit I gave you previously, so the two should be read in 
conjuction.  Also, I wanted to let you and whoever in environmental ends up 
servicing the assets out here two other things:  first, Kenny Maltby of ETS 
Bakersfield is our designated "representative responsible for communications 
with the Department and for overseeing compliance with th[e Take permit]", as 
specified in section 5.1 of the permit.  (Kenny and I are really the only 
personnel in California who are aware of the Permit and its requirements.)  

 Second, various sections of the permit require use of " a knowledgeable, 
experienced biologist."   (See e.g., Section 5.4.)  We have been using a 
biologist in Bakersfield, Randi McCormick, for this purpose for years.  I 
strongly urge we continue to use her because she knows our operations, knows 
our people, knows our contractors, knows our habitat, knows our permit 
conditions, has good relations/credibility  with Cal. Fish and Game and US 
Fish and Wildlife, and has always been reasonable with and responsive to us.  
I would like to get her on a contract wth ETS.

 Lastly, I am getting more eager to see and discuss the results of the audit 
now after your statements regarding the credibility of the sampling in the 
1997 "baseline" study done by WZI.  (It's a very interesting issue for many 
reasons, which I'll spare going into here; obviously, the crux of my concern 
is that it may not be much of a baseline at all.)  So, I would like to have 
some input into the question of how "resampling" would be done, if possible, 
because of the Koch indemnification issues presented.  So please be sure that 
your enviro folks remember our EOTT company motto: "Call Before you Dig!"

 Again, good seeing you and the crew, and I look forward to talking about 
these and other issues again real soon.  In particular, if there's any other 
info i can get your enviro folks that they'd find helpful, please let me 
know. --ETA

The annual pollution prevention plans were completed and submitted to the 
State of Arizona.  These plans are requried for the three large quantity 
generators of hazardous waste in Arizona.

Annual hazardous waste fees were paid and submitted to the State of New 
Mexico for four facilities in New Mexico.

A conference call was held with Houston Legal and Environmetnal Affairs to 
discuss the alleged NOV issued for the P-1 C/S which involved a turbine like 
for like replacement activity.  Data has begun to be collected to 
substantiate Transwestern's position concerning the proposed action by the 
State of New Mexico.  A field trip was made to the Air Quality Bureau to copy 
all files relevant to the P-1 C/S and will be delivered to the contract 
attorney who will be assisting Transwestern with this issue. 

Copies of the New Mexico EOTT air permits were received.  Comparisons will be 
made with the nearly completed EOTT tank database spreadsheet to determine 
status of permit compliance with each air permit.

I was talking with Bill Olson at the NMOCD this afternoon about some other 
issues and inquired about Equilon's reputation. Bill indicated that he has 
had only limited experience dealing with Equilon and apparently has not had 
any bad experience with them. Bill said that they have an abatement project 
ongoing at their Jal Basin Station near Jal, NM. He said that his contact on 
this project is primarily with their consultant, H2A. I am not familiar with 
H2A, but Bill said that they were recently formed from a couple of folks who 
left KEI to form the new company. Bill also indicated that he has had some 
contact with some folks at Equiva, which he believes is an internal 
consulting division of Equilon.

If just looking at the crossing, we should be under the $25,000.  I
estimated by using 300' x $50/foot.  Let me know if you need more info.

Subject:  Fee Increase, from California Fish and Game

Matt, the F&G has increased their permit fees that they charge to access
and cross streambeds for pipeline construction projects.  The fees only
take into account the streambed crossing.  to make this as simple as I can,
the catagories are :

     streambed crossing construction costs of less than $25,000        no
fee

     streambed crossing construction costs of  $25,000 to $500,000
$618.75

     streambed crossing constructoin costs of greater than $500,000
$1390.50

Whats your best guess?  The F&G is holding up the issuing of our permit for
this activity untill I send them the construction costs numbers and
additional fee.  Your help will be appreciated.

Larry,

Does the Victorville site have any geographic relationship to the delivery 
made to SoCal by Kern River (remember that Ralph told us that SoCal had heard 
that some condensate from Kern River had been turned back to them by 
Evergreen due to the fact that it was "hot" with PCB's)?  I would like to 
chat a little about your thoughts on this when you get a minute.  John

Subject: Discoveries of PCB's on Regulator Sites on Southwest Gas

I received a call from Ralph Komai, PCB person for SoCal concerning new hits 
of PCBs at regulator sites on the Southwest Gas system.  It appears that SWG 
did some liquids sampling at two regulator locations near Victorville, Ca. 
and found small volumes of liquid accumulations (less than 2 oz.).  They 
tested the liquid for PCBs and found concentrations of 230 and 132 ppm.  The 
aroclors for the two samples were not known at the time of Ralph's 
notification to me but he stated that SWG plans to do further testing at 
their other 17 regulator locations.  This additional testing will be 
conducted in the near future and Ralph stated that he would share the results 
of his sampling with me.  It should be noted that the location of the two 
positive hits  were immediately downstream of where SoCal delivers gas to 
SWG. 

If we need to discuss this further, contact me at my home  (505) 624-0353 as 
I am taking vacation during the month of December.

On behalf of EOTT, an environmental records review was completed for a block 
of Koch crude oil pipeline assets located in south Texas.  There were no 
issues or environmental deficiencies identified during the review.  A due 
diligence was recommended to verify confirmation of the housekeeping  
activities presented in the records review.

The air permit modification for the La Plata C/S was received from the state 
of Colorado.  This modification allows for additional emissions and fuel use 
as a result of  a change in gas quality supplies in the San Juan basin.

Ann,
Please read the note below related to one of our guys who participates on the 
SW Environmental Team.  Does this really present a problem for the PRC 
process (when I believe there are forms available through the SDWT Manual for 
review purposes)?  I hope Roger Sumlin will correct me if I am too far off 
base on this.  At a minimum I wanted to give you a heads-up that this was a 
problem for the Bakersfield Plant folks and Scott Jones in particular.  John 
Shafer

John/Bill I was speaking with Scott Jones in Bakersfield and he wanted me to 
pass along to you that the server for Bakersfield has been down for the last 
two weeks and is expected to be down for an additional two more weeks.   He 
has been very limited in receiving his email and even less limited in sending 
anything out.   I know this will impact his PEP and interim review responses 
that he is to complete by the May deadline, but he's become a victim of 
circumstance.    His telephone number is 661-765-4087x9 if you should need to 
discuss anything with him.

I am pleased to announce that iBuyit Payables has been activated for all 
organizations supported by Houston Accounts Payable.  iBuyit Payables is an 
innovative tool that will enable us to code and approve invoices for goods 
and services online.

Who is impacted?
Beginning today, all coders and approvers of invoices that were previously 
submitted to Houston Accounts Payable for processing and payment, will code 
and approve invoices through iBuyit Payables.  Invoices entered directly into 
SAP, will not be impacted by this process.

Note:  Beginning May 8th, any invoices with coding sheets received by 
Accounts Payable will be entered into iBuyit Payables and electronically 
routed back to the coder. The invoice will then need to be coded and approved 
(again) in iBuyit Payables to generate a payment. 

How do I receive training?
Online system demonstrations and quick reference cards are available on the 
Enron intranet in the Integrated Solutions Center Document Library at <
http://sap.enron.com/sap_doclib/user/file_list.asp?cabinet_id=265>.  
Note:  You must use the Enron standard Microsoft Internet Explorer to view 
these materials.

Who do I call for help?
*  For help using the iBuyit Payables system, contact the ISC Call Center at 
(713) 345-4727.
*  For invoice payment status, contact the Accounts Payable Call Center at 
(713) 853-7127
 or toll free at (866) AP ENRON, or send an e-mail to 
iBuyit.payables@enron.com <mailto:iBuyit.payables@enron.com>.

Questions?

Today I received the information relayed below regarding activities at the 
Eunice facility.  Judging from the pictures and the description of the work, 
there are compelling indications that former operations at the Eunice 
facility impacted the property owned by Northern Natural Gas.  Please respond 
to the following questions at your earliest convenience:

1) is Texaco aware of the pipeline removal activities; 
2) has the release been stopped and how; 
3) has the extent of impacted soil been determined and does it extend onto 
NNG's property or down to groundwater; and 
4) has the NMOCD been notified. 

I am also concerned that other Texaco pipelines crossing near or through 
NNG's facility may also be in poor condition and should be checked, 
particularly the two lines which cross the southwestern corner of the NNG 
facility near the location of monitor well MW-3 (NNG's well which contains 
PSH).  Your assistance in this matter is appreciated.  I suggest we get 
together sometime in the near future to discuss this recent information.

Subject: NNG Eunice Station - Recent Development

Last week I received a message from the Eunice Team that Dynegy, the current 
owner of the adjacent Texaco Plant, had recently undertaken a project to 
remove a large diameter low pressure sour gas pipeline located just west of 
the NNG facility. The Team took photos of the removed section of pipe and the 
excavated soil. The removed pipe has at least two repair patches and there 
was considerable hydrocarbon stained soil removed from the pipe trench. Four 
of the Team's photos are attached with this message. Also attached is an 
updated diagram indicating the location of the removed section of pipe. The 
diagram is saved in a Microsoft HTML format that may require Microsoft 
Explorer to view. If you have trouble opening the file, refer to the diagram 
recently generated for the letter regarding the excavation activities. The 
location of the removed section runs from the western edge of the pit 
excavation area towards the north-northwest. This places the removed line 
within approximately 50 feet of our monitor well MW-3 (the well which has PSH 
above the water table).

=20
000/2001 Winter Season



As a result of feedback received at the July 6 reliability collaborative,
Con Edison has made the following changes to its capacity release/delivery
service programs for the 2000/2001 winter season.

First, to assist you in meeting your primary point obligations relating to
the firm load on our system that you are serving, Con Edison will make
available to Marketers 25,000 dt/day on Transco.  Your allocation based on
active customers in your group as of July 1, 2000 is
511 dt/day in the form of either:

  (a) a capacity release of Transco capacity at the
Transco maximum
   rate for the 12-month period November 2000 through
October 2001,
   or

  (b) a bundled citygate sale for November 2000 through
March 2001 priced
   as follows:

*  Inside F.E.R.C.=01,s first of the month index price at
    Transco/Zone 3 (Station 65) plus $1.00/dt.

 or;

  (c) a combination of the two adding up to 511 dt per
day.


Second, in addition to the above, we can make available to you 204 dt/day
during March 2001 as a bundled citygate sale on the same terms as set forth
above.

Third, with respect to the balance of capacity that you may require to meet
your primary point obligations,

  (a) There will be no citygate allocation requirements
for this winter, except for the 25% limitation on Texas Eastern. (i.e., you
may deliver     all of your gas to any of the
following receipt points, except that no more than 25% may be delivered to
Texas Eastern.

       Transco (Receipt
Point: 134th Street - Manhattan, Central Manhattan, Narrows or Long Beach)

       Tennessee (Receipt
Point:  White Plains)

  (b) We will permit you to meet the primary point
requirement using your Daily Load Following Service Quantity (for Load
Following Service)  or Daily Load Quantity (for Daily Delivery Service)
during November instead of the Average Day/Peak Month quantity used during
the remaining four winter months.

  (c) Prior to the winter, you can trade all or part of
your citygate allocation on Texas Eastern to another marketer, so long as
the aggregate entitlement for deliveries on Texas Eastern among all
marketers remains below 25% of the combined total allocation.

Please let us know on or before close of business Friday, July 28, 2000
which, if any, of the above-described services you are interested in.

NOTES:
1. We will advise you if additional capacity becomes available as a
result of actions taken by other marketers.
2. Bundled sales service is subject to the execution of a written
agreement (on mutually agreeable terms), including a take-or-pay commitment
and resolution of any creditworthiness issues.

Kenny and all:

Here is an update regarding where we stand with Rogas biological resources
permitting:

FESA 10a(1)B: U.S.F.W.S. has mailed the letter to Kern Water Bank Authority
authorizing KWBA to sell credits to EOTT and permitting EOTT to be a
"covered" third party under KWBA's 10a(1)B permit; however, KWBA has not yet
received the letter. When KWBA receives the letter, they will be able to
authorize the project as soon as they receive the check from EOTT for
compensation credits (I do not know if your right-of-way agreements and
encroachment permits are complete) and mitigation measures are implemented
(preactivity surveys, trapping).

CESA 2081 MOU: EOTT has notified CDFG that the project will commence and who
the project rep is; CDFG has verbally concurred regarding our proposed
avoidance measures (including trapping) for Tipton kangaroo rats and
blunt-nosed leopard lizard; the project may commence on Coles Levee Ecosystem
Preserve as soon as we implement the biological resource mitigation measures
(preactivity survey - submitted to AERA; trapping; etc.) and the Letter of
Credit (or equivalent) is submitted to CDFG for compensation acres.

Bypass Channel: West Coast Environmental was supposed to have submitted
Streambed Alteration Notification and Clean Water Act (Army Corps)
notification within the last couple of days.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this e-mail.

Yesterday evening I phoned both the state of Arizona ( agency for stations 1 
and 2) and Region 9 EPA ( agency for stations 3 and 4) concerning the status 
of when the air permits would be issued by both agencies for the Redrock 
expansion.  I was surprised to find out that both agencies stated a 2-4 month 
delay prior to issuance.  They cited back log of other permits, public 
comment periods, and workload as being the main reasons.  I am particularily 
disappointed because there were pre meetings with both agencies identifying 
what was to be included in each application package, and even after the 
applications were submitted in March of this year, each agency came back and 
asked for different information that from what was discussed at each meeting.

I have a call into the state of Arizona ( construction is to begin at Station 
2 and they have jurisdiction for this station) to see if we can initiate  
some construction activities  such as laying pipe and building foundations 
prior to receiving the permit.  I have been given these types of approvals 
from other agencies in the past, but these types of approvals are extremely 
narrow and restrictive.   If this flys I am sure that they will require us to 
make sure the turbine is not brought on site until the permit has been 
issued.  I know this will require written approval from the agency, but this 
may allow us to proceed on schedule and avoid any delays.  Ill keep you 
apprised of this issue.

Advisors, presented below is a memo from GPG Houston requesting that we 
provide to them the number of ETS employees in each team who have taken 
advantage of the one year free membership with The Nature Conservancy.  
Apparently there is some concern that employees are not taking advantage of 
the opportunity which has been provided for them to get involved with an 
organization that has some benefit towards wildlife and habitat preservation 
and enhancement.  Should an employee desire to sign up for the one year free 
memebership, the Conservancy the web address is www.tnc.org.  You can click 
the button that says "Become a member" and sign up for the annual membership 
at that time.  At the request of Mr. John Shafer, please provide to me a 
total by  team of the number of individuals which have signed up with the 
Nature Conservancy by the end of the month.

Your assistance in this is greatly appreciated

Subject: TNC Membership

On a conference call on Wednesday concerning the ETS/TNC partnership, John 
Shafer was concerned about the numbers of ETS employees signing up for the 
free membership program.  John ask that I contact each of the DES's and 
coordinate with them the contact of members of all ETS teams to encourage 
them to take advantage of the free membership.  The thought is once the team 
members receive the material concerning The Nature Conservancy (TNC) they 
might as individuals or as teams be encourage to participate actively in the 
programs.

Phil Lowry endorses the program and has agreed for ETS to pay the first years 
membership.  It would probably be correct to contact your Regional Directors 
and Advisors prior to contacting the teams.  John Shafer would like to see 
100 % participation in the program.

I understand we all have busy schedules, so if you don't have time, I would 
be happy to make the contact for you.  John asked that I track these numbers 
for reporting to him on our next conference call (probably in September).  
Could I get the team names and the number of employees that have elected to 
participate.

In advance thank you for your time and effort in this matter.  Again I would 
be happy to make the contacts for you.

Mr. Campbell,

Attached is a summary table showing the inspection types and intervals
required by 49 CFR 195 and 40 CFR 60.  49 CFR 195 is a DOT regulation that
references API 653 for affected tanks.  There are no exemptions for age or
size.  The DOT inspections focus on physical integrity of the tank to
prevent catostrophic failure.  The 40 CFR rules are aimed at emissions and
these do have age and size limitations.  Let me know if this is satisfactory
or if you need anything else.

I attended a TXOGA pipeline committee meeting yesterday and the Grandfather 
legislation was discussed in detail. The following information is in addition 
to the previous message on this legislation:

Several members could not agree on whether the option being offered by TNRCC 
of using old standard exemptions to "authorize" grandfathered emission 
sources would be pulled off the table on September 1, 2001. The general 
consensus is that companies should complete the process of using the old 
exemptions by September 1 in case TNRCC does not allow this option anymore;

Although the legislation allows 0 to 20% reductions on pipeline engines in 
West Texas, TNRCC has indicated that they will not require reductions in West 
Texas, except for "huge emitters". No one knows what they mean by huge 
emitters;

TNRCC is required to reduce compressor engine NOx emissions by 50% in East 
Texas, but MAY require 50% VOC reductions in East Texas. No one has heard 
whether TNRCC will require VOC reductions. VOC reductions on a 2-cycle 
engine, especially on a Cooper engine with good combustion characteristics, 
could be problematic;

The TXOGA Pipeline committee will take the lead on responding to the 
regulations that are developed due to this legislation. I will certainly 
participate in this process.

Marc

1. Status of Mainline Filter Separator Project.

Earl Chanley has indicated that the June 1 target date for in service is on 
schedule.  There will be 2 mainline separators for each mainline system.  
PG&E is also on schedule for June 5 & 7 pipeline tie ins to each bank of 
separators.  The only outstanding issue is an air permit for the 1200 gallon 
tank at the separator installation site.  This is a PG&E issue and will not 
create a delay of the in-service date.  All other permits and approvals, 
according to PG&E, are in place.

PG&E has stated that after operation of the separators, they will want to 
discuss maintenance issues with ET&S.

Post construction of the separators will result in 2-50 ft joints of 34 in. 
pipe.  PG&E will perform wipe tests on each piece to determine reuse and or 
disposal.  If the pieces test  to be regulated by state and federal, PG&E 
will consult their legal group to determine whether they will decon or 
dispose as a PCB regulated material.  If the decision is to decon, PG&E has 
indicated that they will seek another contractor other than Vector to reduce 
costs associated with cleaning the pipe.

2. Review Test Results of Ongoing Gas Sampling. 

Update since last sampling discussion in San Francisco.  Good news is that at 
MP 353 (kettleman C/S), latest sampling showed non detect.  The third round 
of sampling taken at this location is not available.  All other samples 
collected at suspected liquids locations areas showed PCB liquids results to 
be decreasing  toward Hinkley C/S.  Line 311 is a 12 in. line which travels 
north to Ridgecrest, Ca  also feeds  IMC Chemical Plant.  Previous testing 
showed non detect.  Most recent sample showed 22 ppm.   Second sample has 
been collected but results are not available.  Samples are proposed to be 
collected at the IMC Chemical Plant.  There is a potential for the IMC Plant 
to be PG&E's biggest single commercial customer and therefore, this site is 
considered to be a sensitive area relating to PCB's.

Kern River Station continues to show PCB concentrations  of 1-3 ppm.   The 
gas from this location feeds into a portion of the Southern California Gas 
Co.  system which is PCB free.

3. Discuss Future Sampling Process and Frequency. 

West end of the PG&E system has not been sampled.  The east end of the system 
has at least 2 rounds of sampling conducted.  Sampling frequency for these 
locations is once every two weeks.  When a sampling location is shown  to 
have liquids, it is resampled two weeks later and is included into the 
sampling program.  
Transwestern has requested to PG&E to increase the collection reservoirs 
under the meters and valves to allow greater removal liquids from the 
pipeline system.  At the present time a small nipple is inserted into the 
bottom of the valve and meter body  for the liquids collection.  By 
increasing the nipple size,  a greater collection container will be produced.

It was mutually agreed that until installation and operation of the two the 
separators, PG&E will continue to sample each location once every two weeks.

4. Review Criteria Used to Determine Need for Tap Filter/Separators.

Originally 29 locations were identified to receive the small filter 
separators.  These locations were considered Priority 1 sites.  The 
determination of a Priority 1 site is based upon the following criteria:  1) 
a location where liquids were collected twice and 2)  ppm concentration of 
the liquids collected was > 1.0 ppm.
Based upon these criteria, Ridgecrest and Bakersfield (Kern River Station) 
have been added to the list of Priority sites.  Flow through at the Kern 
River location is 300-500 mmscf/day.  Samples collected at this location have 
shown PCB's in the range of 1-4 ppm.  PG&E's agreement with SoCal at this 
location is <1.0 ppm PCB's in the liquid phase.   PG&E has indicated that 
there is some sensitivity at both of these locations due to the large volume 
of gas deliveries.

PG&E and Southwest Gas have been in discussions concerning 5 additional 
filter separators on the Southwest Gas system due to substantial customer 
load at these locations.  Southwest Gas feels it needs additional protection 
at these sites.  PG&E has stated that Southwest Gas is beginning to express 
additional concern for PCB's at their interconnect locations.

5. Review and Discuss List of Proposed Tap Filter/Separators.

 a. Siting, Design and Engineering

 b. Cost Estimates 

PG&E passed out a booklet pertaining to 9 small filter separator sites, plus 
an additional sheet for 16 sites with back-up to be produced in the next 
week. .  Four of these separators have been installed.  A total of 45 filter 
separators may be proposed for installation.  

The cost estimates for the additional small volume  F/S up to the 29 
indicated at the last meeting is 1.2 to 1.3 million.  The sampling costs have 
not been included in this number. Estimates are being reviewed on a per sites 
basis as PG&E presented.

One PG&E customer, a cement plant, has inquired about PG&E deconning portions 
of their plant that has PCB's.  PG&E is in discussions with the cement 
company.   PG&E has informed the cement plant that it will evaluate the 
success of the filter separators to be installed on the line feeding the 
cement plant prior to committing to any action.  If the deconning occurs, it 
will be a 2001 project.

6. Ongoing Consideration of Additional Customer Protection.

Compressor Oil Control.  The majority of liquids collected at strategic 
sampling locations is compressor oils.  Transwestern has requested access to 
the PG&E C/S to study lube oil systems.  There are 22 compressors at the 
Topock and Hinkley C/S's.  Transwestern will conduct a  study of technologies 
to assist in reducing oil from entering the pipeline system.  Earl will 
coordinate site visits with Glen Riddle.

7. Other Issues or Concerns.

Earl requested additional information on invoices submitted after January, 
2000.  rod will send back up and support data of existing invoices sent to 
Transwestern.  

PG&E is considering increasing gas receipts from Transwestern to 250-300 
mmscf/day cap by May 15.  Over time PG&E will look into their C/S 
configurations to handle the increased gas flows to 450 mm scf/day.  

8. Next Steps.

The next meeting was proposed in 45 days.  This time period will allow 
inspection and operation of the mainline filter separators and collection   
additional sampling data at new and suspected sampling sites.  The location 
of the next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Flagstaff AZ on July 13 as 
some of the PG&E meeting attendees will be in Flagstaff during that week on 
other business.

Tim,
 ET has had wholesale changes in its personnel recently. Here's the
three contacts that I talk to:

 East   John Ed James  713-371-6673
 Midwest  Tom Dickey   713-371-6163
 West    Allen King    713-371-6123

 If they can't handle the transaction, they know who can. Note that
both John Ed James and Tom Dickey will be leaving the company at the end of
the summer. Allen King is basis backup for the West, but he has always
handled my FOM deals (Allen will be moving with ET to Bethesda). Minor
intramonth changes usually can be done by the scheduler at ET, they'll tell
you if you need to talk to a trader.

  Thanks,
   Scott

Thanks for the update. Are these contacts for scheduling purposes only? If
so, do you have the trader contacts? Please advise. Thanks.

There is one mistake in my email. The BIC meeting I refer to as "December 1"
is the November 30 BIC meeting.

Importance: High


Attached in support of Agenda Item 5B , ICAP, for the December 12, 2000
Business Issues Committee meeting, and pursuant to the motion passed at the
December 1, 2000 BIC meeting, are the following documents:

1. A clean version of proposed Tariff language on Stage 1A ICAP, consisting
of all those modifications made by the ICAPWG over the course of their
deliberations in the last few months with the exception of  (1) UCAP and (2)
one month OPP; and

2. A blacklined version of that proposed Tariff, marked to show changes from
the current Tariff.

The clean version includes a table of contents for ease of review.

Please note that, pursuant to the motion passed by BIC on December 1,
substantive changes not included in the ICAPWG November 21 Proposed Tariff
(considered by BIC on December 1) must be presented on separate motion at
the December 12 meeting.  The ISO has one such change, to Section 5.12.10;
the language was circulated prior to the December 1 BIC meeting and will be
recirculated tomorrow.

Please call or write with questions or comments. Many thanks.

Great, Jerry. I take it then that simultaneous operation of the new and old 
is a physical impossibility. Can we take this to the next step then, to 
carefully walk through the netting calculations (Shudeish & Prabhat are doing 
this) to minimize the total emissions that can occur ("potential to emit") at 
any one time. The way I read the existing permits, however, is that allowable 
(and unenforceable bec of grandfathering?) emissions are NOx is 1428 tpy and 
CO is 429 tpy at each station, which may mean that we can not characterize 
these as "minor" sources. If the netting calculation is such that we can 
avoid New Source Review (I believe this to be the case bec there is planned 
to be a new reduction), we can do the 401.01(5) construction activities and 
try to get a fast-track permit approval.
I still do not whether, as a technical matter, the applications could qualify 
as "minor" revisions under R18-2-319.A, which mean,
1. Do not violate any applicable requirement
2. Do not involve substantive changes to existing monitoring, reporting, or 
record-keeping requirements in the permit
3. Do not require or change a case-by-case determination of an emission 
limitation or other standard, or a source-specific determination of ambient 
impacts, or a visibility or increment analysis
4. Do not seek to establish or change a permit condition for which there is 
no corresponding underlying applicable requirement and that the source has 
assumed in order to avoid an applicable requirement to which the source would 
otherwise be subject. The terms and conditions include:
     a. A federally enforceable emissions cap that the source would assume to 
avoid classification as a modification under any provision of Title I of the 
Clean Air Act; and
     b. An alternative emisssions limit approved under regulations 
promulgated under CAA sec 112(i)(5)
5. Are not modifications under and provision of Title I of the CAA
6. Are not changes in fuels not represented in the permit application or 
provided for in the permit
7. The increase in the source's potential to emit is not significant (40 tpy 
NOx, etc) [not applicable to TWP bec net reduction]
8. Are not required to processed as a significant revision under R18-2-320 
(refers to signif change in existing monitoring terms or relaxation of 
reporting/recordkeeping or "does not qualify as a minor permit revision....")
If someone could make a hard analysis of the foregoing, that might provide us 
additional strength.
Van Wolf

>>> <Jerry.D.Martin@enron.com> 9/26/2001 1:24:56 PM >>>
Van, the 3 old units and 1 new unit at each station cannot run
simultaneously.  There is only so much gas in the line leading to each
station, and there is a limit to the discharge pressure.  If we tried to
start the new unit with the old units running, the suction pressure would
decrease significantly, and the discharge pressure would increase,
automatically shutting down all units rather quickly.  Even if it was
physically possible, we would be literally "spinning our wheels" with no
benefit - burning fuel with no increase in throughput.

I'll be happy to explain this to Ms. Wrona tomorrow.

Thanks,
Jerry

   Subject:  Red Rock/ADEQ: Nancy Wrona meeting

   I just met with Steve Burr, ADEQ Special Counsel, to discuss options and
   develop a strategy to rush the permit issuance schedule and/or allow
   significant construction to begin before actual issuance of the permit.
   He will attend the meeting tomorrow by teleconf because he thinks it
   would help if both of us attended as there are legal issues.

   He spoke with Prabhat yesterday, and both he and Prabhat believe this is
   a good project that should go forward expeditiously, but ADEQ must stick
   with its rules and policy interpretations. Nonetheless, there appears to
   be a way to re-interpret the application possibly to be a "minor"
   revision. The key will be assure that, during the construction period
   and the transition period, as well as operating procedures, all of the
   equipment that could operate at the same time does not have the
   "potential to emit" contaminants in excess of 250 tons per year (tpy).
   For the meeting with Nancy, someone, I assume it will be Larry, will
   need to be acutely familiar with the details of the permits revisions
   applications to be able to walk this through with Prabhat & Shudeish. I
   can review this as well, in order to discuss it with Steve, but we will
   need to make sure we have our technical ducks all lined up. In that
   sense, the appropriate person should please review the Ariz air rules at
   R18-2-319.A (minor revision to Class I source permit) and R18-2-401,
   definition of "major source" esp subsec c (to avoid "new source
   review"). Let me know if I need to fax these to anyone, but they may
   also be on the ADEQ website (www.adeq.state.az.us).

   For policy reasons, ADEQ needs to limit pre-permit construction because
   otherwise it would be subject to political pressure from sources with
   sunk capital costs. For TWP's purposes, the key is to keep the total
   "potential to emit" at each station below 250 tpy to avoid New Source
   Review. [I am out of my legal "depth" here and need technical
   assistance; the permit applications seem to indicate an increase in NOx
   and CO as well as a decrease in the same section (see sec 2.2 on
   Netting)as well as being subject to New Source Review (sec 3.2); there
   may some language in the applications that is somewhat misleading; the
   netting calculation is going to be important). The concern will be
   whether the old reciprocating compressors and the new turbine can all
   operate at the same time so as to result in significantly excess
   emissions. Are there operating (end enforceable) restrictions that would
   prohinbit operation of equipment that would cause emissions in excess of
   what currently allowed?

   If the permit revisions can be recharacterized as "minor," either there
   are no restrictions on immediate commencement of all contruction (only
   seven days notice required) or the allowable construction is that set
   forth in Ariz law at ARS 49-401.01(5), which would allow "installation
   of building supports and foundations, laying of underground pipework and
   construction of permanent storage structures." It appears that
   site-deliveries could occur, but I am not sure about tie-ins.

   I am somewhat skeptical that we can get a complete "minor" revision
   approach because I think this is a "major" source and the emissions
   limitations are significant. We may, with the netting, be able to avoid
   NSR and get 401.01(5) construction, but we will need technical analysis
   to be creative as to how the revisions set up the equipment changes and,
   in particular, whether we can screw down the operating procedures and
   transition to limit the "potential to emit."

   Thus, it will also be important to try to get a faster permit
   review/approval schedule. We agreed that TWP's "negotiating period" will
   be quick. EPA needs a 45-day review, but can we get submittals to EPA
   now (these revisions are essentially the same as for Stations #3 & #$,
   which EPA is about to approve) and get a faster indication of "no
   objections" from EPA?

   I sense Burr wants to help us come up with creative solutions, and I
   believe this will be Nancy's intent as well. Please let me know what
   further I can do from this end to prepare for tomorrow's meeting. I will
   have the conference room ready for a pre-meeting strategy session.

I attended a meeting on July 30 with the Texas Intrastate Pipeline 
Association where TNRCC personnel made a presentation on the implementation 
of the grandfather legislation and Charlie Child attended a meeting on August 
7 where TNRCC also made a presentation on the grandfather legislation. 

The following existing authorization options are available for grandfathered 
sources: old Standard Exemptions, Voluntary Emission Reduction Permits 
(VERP), regular permits or Permits By Rule.  The grandfather legislation, 
which is still in the rulemaking process, is for permitting grandfathered 
sources that have not been authorized by the existing options.  These 
programs are discussed below.

Old Standard Exemptions
As you know, ETS has implemented a program to authorize grandfathered 
emission sources under old Standard Exemptions (now Permits by Rule) wherever 
possible so they would not be subject to the grandfather regulations. TNRCC 
indicated at the meeting that you would have until the deadlines for 
submitting applications (9/1/03 in east Texas and 9/1/04 in West Texas) to 
authorize the sources under old St. Ex.  Keep in mind that this program is 
not part of the TNRCC regulations-it is being implemented under a verbal 
agreement with the TNRCC and could change at any moment.  TNRCC recommended 
that PI-7 forms be submitted for all locations that are included on their 
1997 list of emission sources (Note: the list is based on TNRCC's listing of 
1997 emissions inventories and Ruth has distributed this list to the 
appropriate DESs). For locations not on this list, internal records would be 
sufficient and nothing needs to be submitted to TNRCC (unless required under 
the conditions of the St.Ex.). One thing to keep in mind is that TNRCC is 
revising the rules governing Permits by Rule/St. Ex. with increased 
recordkeeping requirements so that any emission sources authorized by St.Ex. 
will be subject to the new recordkeeping rules (scheduled to be finalized on 
9/26/01).  It is recommended that the Standard Exemption submittals be 
received by the TNRCC as soon as possible.  In addition to engines, old 
Standard Exemptions or existing Permits By Rule should be used for the 
remaining grandfathered sources (tanks, heaters, etc.).

Grandfather Legislation
The grandfather legislation includes a specific permit for reciprocating 
engines.  Other grandfather sources must obtain an "Existing Facility Permit" 
under the legislation.  Unlike the Voluntary Emission Reduction Permits 
(VERP) program, there is no amnesty granted for modifications uncovered 
during the permitting process.  Discovery of a modification may result in 
enforcement action.  In addition, the source is no longer eligible for a 
grandfather permit and must obtain a regular permit or Permit By Rule and be 
subject to BACT (~2 g/bhp-hr).  In order to take advantage of the VERP 
program amnesty provision, TNRCC is urging industry to submit VERP 
applications by the August 31, 2001 deadline.

Under the grandfather legislation, grandfathered reciprocating engines in 
East Texas are subject to 50% reductions of NOx and may be subject to 50% 
reductions of VOC. Recips in West Texas are subject to up to 20% reductions 
of NOx and VOC. The reductions will be determined on a case-by case basis by 
the permit engineer reviewing the application. Although previously there was 
hope that no reductions would be required in West Texas, at the August 7 
meeting TNRCC indicated that they would require at least 1% reductions in 
West Texas. TNRCC has not decided how to deal with VOC reductions but one 
TNRCC staff member did mention he was aware that oxidation catalysts could 
reduce VOC emissions on engines.

In the August 7 meeting, TNRCC indicated that the reductions for recips will 
be calculated from a baseline of the average actual emissions in 1997-9. This 
was not the intent of the legislation and the legislators will be contacted 
by our industry organizations to attempt to change this. My thinking is that 
the reductions will likely be based on a "before" hourly grams/hp-hr rate 
from stack testing (or maybe AP-42) and an "after" hourly emissions rate 
based on stack testing. 

The reductions required from recips can be averaged across a pipeline, but 
reductions mandated by a regulation cannot be included. Reductions from a 
shutdown of an emission source can be included in the average, and it was 
suggested that reductions since 1997 could be included, but this has not been 
determined. It is highly unlikely that that TNRCC will allow reductions in 
East Texas to be averaged with reductions in West Texas.

Grandfathered emission sources other than recips are subject to 10-year old 
BACT. When discussing whether there would be any relief for smaller emission 
sources such as grandfathered valves or flanges, the TNRCC attorney indicated 
that there is no lower threshold and that all emissions sources must be 
authorized either by the existing authorizations or grandfather permits by 
the deadlines in  this legislation. See the notes above about the locations 
that TNRCC expects paperwork to be submitted for St. Ex.

The control/reduction deadlines for reducing emissions from all grandfathered 
emission sources is 3/1/07 in East Texas and 3/1/08 in West Texas. However 
TNRCC indicated that controls will likely be required prior to these dates. 
When you receive your permit for grandfathered sources, they anticipate that 
you will have 18 months to install controls. Since the applications are due 
on 9/1/03 and 9/1/04, and  TNRCC has one year to process applications (but it 
could be less), you should anticipate being required to install controls in 
2005-2007. The application fee may be $450.

The grandfather rule will be proposed on October 24, 2001 and should be 
finalized in March 2002.

I concur with Mark. The only answer if you want to sign up more is to de

If only 150 MW can be called on when the NYISO needs them then no more than
150 MW should be allowed to qualify as ICAP providers.  The purpose of ICAP
is to assure that the NYISO has capacity when it needs it.  "Having" the
capacity and then not being allowed to use it makes the capacity worthless.
Resources that cannot be called upon are do not add to system security.

Subject:        RE: 150 mW DEC Cap for "Emergency Exempt" for EDRP

Larry:

A couple of comments:

1. I recommend that the 150 MW limit be managed by NYISO Operations.  They
are going to understand the problems in real time and should have complete
authority of which generators get run based on the situation. Trying to
fairly rotate which units get called at this late date, given the hours of
operation are completely unknown would be a waste of time, in my opinion.

2. We all should be very grateful that the DEC has taken the action they
have on expanding the exempt generator definition.  If people are not happy
with the 150MW cap then they should get a registration or state facility
permit and notify the ISO that the their site is not to be counted in the
150 MW cap calculation.

3. Not paying full ICAP for these resources would be a disaster.  If we want
to kill the emergency program, this is the best way to do it.  Again,
calling of generators should be based on the NYISO Operations assessment of
the emergency situation.  A special case resource generator standing ready
to serve, even if DEC has placed some limits on the number of MW running at
one time, should not be penalized by this cap.  We may find situations where
some of the SCR "exempt" generators called can not start or limit their
generation hours for some reason.  In this case we need as many SCR
resources ready to fill the void as possible. Limit payments really hurts
the credibility and effectiveness of the programs we have all worked so hard
to develop.

4. I do not think the EDRP manuals need to say anything on this subject.
This should strictly be an internal NYISO operation matter on which
generators get called in each zone.  If the Operations manual needs to be
updated to reflect the 150 MW exempt generator class of EDRP generators lets
do it here not in the EDRP manual.

Looking forward to Monday's discussion. Have a great weekend.

Subject:        150 mW DEC Cap for "Emergency Exempt" for EDRP

Colleagues,
This is a "heads up" that there are several issues we will need to look at
on Monday with respect to the new NYS DEC expanded definition of "emergency
exempt" when participating in the EDRP.  The problems needing solving that I
am aware of so far concern the 150 mW cap that DEC placed on the ISO's call
for emergency customer generation.  Our understanding is that more than that
amount can be signed up for the program--but only 150 mWs can be called at
any one time.

Some have suggested that the DEC does not have the right or power to
regulate the NYISO.  I don't know.  But I do know that DEC would revoke this
in heart-beat if they thought we were going to ignore it--especially after
all these different parties, including the ISO and the self-generation
developers, bargained with NYS DEC to do what they have done.  Also, the
individual participating customers would be more than some upset if they
found out that DEC was revoking their emergency exempt status because they
were deemed to have been the ones who were over the 150 mW limit in an
emergency call.

There are two problems that I have seen, both related to enrolling more than
150 mWs of emergency exempt EDRP participants.  First, if there is more than
150 mWs in the region being called, we need to determine a method for who
gets called--it could rotate in an equitable fashion.  But our manual should
probably speak to this.

The other problem is that we probably shouldn't be paying full ICAP to 300
mWs of emergency exempt EDRP participants if we know that no more than half
of them can respond to any ICAP call.  We might derate them in percentage to
the subscription over the 150 mWs.  Or some other system.

My purpose here is to alert you to the issue and suggest that we want to
come up with a solution on Monday.  I spoke with Mollie Lampi about it and
hope the ISO has a chance to work on it today.  We want all EDRP and DADRP
manual matters to go before the BIC on May 24th.

Have a great weekend and thanks for all of the creative thinking and
constructive participation on getting these programs as right as we can as
quickly as we can!

Larry

Just a quick note on a statement Stan Horton made at a recent meeting with 
the OTS group.  Stan stated that the GPG was the foundation of the "Enron 
House" and that it would be difficult for Enron to keep it's current bond 
rating without GPG's revenue.

Dan, sorry about taking so long it getting back to you about this, but I had 
a couple of crises I had to address,  Im still realing from the impact.  I 
have attached for your review the agreement which we are in the process of 
finalizing with the Wild Turkey Federation.  Take a look at the document and 
let me know what you think.  After your review we can make the necessary 
changes and modifications.  I have been advised by our legal department that 
each of the three major pipelines owned and operated by Enron will need a 
separate contract, with the RMEF, so what we decide for Transwestern, will 
undoubtably work for the others.  Thanks for your patience in this.

Larry:

Ruth indicated you are having problems with EPA Region 6. Attached is a file 
with two EPA letters 
that include the statements:

     "granted a waiver
     from the fuel nitrogen monitoring requirement as natural
     gas fuel has been determined to contain no fuel bound
     nitrogen and having free nitrogen which does not contribute
     appreciably to the formation of NOx emissions"

and


 "EPA has already determined that nitrogen monitoring
     can be waived for pipeline-quality natural gas since there
     is no fuel bound nitrogen and the free nitrogen does not
     contribute appreciably to NOx emissions."


I also have an EPA contact in Research Triangle Park that is quite familiar 
with turbine NSPS regs.

Give me a call if you need more help.

Marc

Hi Jon,
This is a joint Duncan - Jim Linville reply.
First, for all intents and purposes, expect GF status to go away when the
legislature comes back to town.  With that in mind, what exactly is
happening with this engine.  Does the carburetor replace the mixer valves?
 If so, this must be one ancient engine!  And unlikely to get in under VERP
or any other program designed to end GF status.  Tell us more.
Duncan

Duncan,
I have some grandfathered gas compressor engines in west Texas.  We are
going to change out the old mixer valves and install carburetors on the
units as a maintenance activity.  Horsepower and emissions will not
increase.  I can maintain my grandfathered status, correct?  We will of
course document this activity and provide copies to the regional office.
Thanks,
Jon Fields

Guys, I received Harrell's memo concerning the fuel use for the turbine and 
the fact that you had to reduce gas producer speeds to comply with the 
permits fuel use requirements.  My question is, how does the fuel use compare 
with what Solar says the fuel use should be?  If we can get Solar to provide 
written guarantees and "UP" the fuel use value for the turbine, we can up the 
fuel value on the permit.  The state of Colorado perceives increased fuel use 
beyond manufacturers values as the turbine not operating correctly and in 
need of mechanical adjustment.  From their eyes, this would be a strong 
indication of excess emissions, and I think there evaluation would hold some 
merit.  Anyway, I dont want to send up a red flag to the state of Colorado.  

Would you contact Solar and compare their fuel use values with what the 
monitors say the turbine is burning at La Plata? 

Then let me know.  If worse gets to worse, I may be able to use another 
tactic, but only as a last resort.

Joe,

In April last year we submitted a copy of the attached work plan to your 
office. I believe your office forwarded the plan on to your Austin office for 
review. The scope of the work plan has been completed. Please let me know if 
you have any further questions regarding this issue.

Thanks, George

George,

I have a slight dilema.  Are you working a site by the name of:

Pecos County # 6 Compressor Station-Northern Natural Gas Company
If so, is their a possibility of obtaining a copy of the lastest report.
The Austin office indicates we took in to our reception a report on May 7,
1998.  But, for some reason we (Midland) do not have anything relating to
this.  Can you please advise either way.  I would appreciate it.  Thanks
George.

Attached is an additional motion to support the Stage 2 ICAP proposed
Tariff, which is Agenda Item 5B for the May 24 BIC meeting.

As you may know, the translation of the In-City price cap from ICAP to UCAP
is a pending item from the proposed ICAP Manual. The ICAP Working Group
concluded at its last meeting that, if the parties could not agree upon a
translation number, the matter should be taken to FERC for a decision.

FERC Staff has agreed that FERC will take up the issue if no consensus is
reached. Alternative positions on the translation issue will be laid out in
the cover letter to the Tariff filing; comments from any party interested in
filing on the translation issue would be due ten business days after the ISO
files the proposed Tariff. The attached motion seeks approval for this
approach.

The ICAPWG may withdraw the motion if consensus is reached before the BIC
meeting.

If you have any questions, please contact Howard Fromer, chair of the
ICAPWG, or me.

Randy, I need your assistance with something.  Im trying to determine 
compliance for all the EOTT crude oil storage tanks in the Midland Region.  
Bill told me that you have a spreadsheet of the EOTT tanks showing some of 
the tank characteristics (size, storage, date of installation, state etc). 
Whatever you have, I would greatly appreciate your shaing it with me.  E mail 
works best for me.  

Thanks again.

If you send this to me, I promise to let you out fish me like you did in 
Minnesota a couple of years ago.......

Bret--the work on the old Texaco pit is finished and I am told that neither
Texaco , nor the NMOCD found evidence of migration to the Northern
compressor site. Once you have had a chance to talk to your clients,  and
the Enron consultants who witnessed the work, give me a call and lets
discuss the next step.  I am not sure the settlement agreements we drafted
are still relevant.

As you can see , I am now in our Houston office. You can now contact me at
the numbers shown below. The email address is unchanged. I will be in the
office through Thursday, and out of town the following week.

Let me know when you are ready to discuss this.

Rich / Larry / Earl:

I sent a letter to Mike Katz, copy to Rod Boschee, that formally restated 
what I had requested at our last meeting in San Francisco. They responded 
with what they agree to, which I believe we can (and will have to) live with.

I will not be attending the meeting this Thursday due to conflicts, but will 
be available to attend via phone.

1.  TW will fund in year 2000 the installation of the necessary PG&E customer 
filter separators and the additional costs related to PG&E's PCB testing.

action items
GQC: Thoroughly review PG&E customer F/S sites and costs. Formally get 
agreement.

Earl: Prepare a new work order for $3,000,000 naming specific sites and costs 
related to sampling and analysis.

Note: I have requested an additional $3,000,000 for this years Capital Plan 
to do this work, which Bill has received verbally from Stan. 

2. PG&E will lift the 250 / D limit and move to market driven conditions of 
up to 300 / D at Topock on May 15 with on-going monitoring to ensure no 
further migration of PCB's. They wish for a six month test on this condition.

action item:
Rich: Review formal pigging and sampling plan with Tiny and Needles Team.

Rich / Larry: Increase or reinforce pigging and analysis on Topock Lateral, 
as well as any mainline pigging and analysis required due to Gallup increase 
volumes.

3. PG&E will delay / defer consideration of deconning the Topock Compressor 
Station until 2001. Tests in 2001 will determine further consideration.

4. Establishment of a gas quality committee (GQC): Larry, Rich, Earl. (I will 
continue as the lead on this with Louis Saldano available)  

GQC: Take and distribute formal minutes with agreed action items.

Mike

Larry,

I called Roger this morning to make sure he had received the BA.  He said
that he had not yet gotten it, but that it should be there around noon.  I
asked him to be sure to get back to me ASAP with any inadequacies, so we
could fix them immediately.  He said that they have decided that they don't
need to have all of the ESA requirements satisfied prior to Public Noticing
the project.  This is good news.  He didn't say how soon they would be able
to Notice it, but they don't have to wait for the BA to be exactly what they
want it to be, prior to.  Scott

John, Bill this is the latest on the environmental issues for the turbines in 
Arizona.  The arch surveys at stations 3 and 4 on the Navajo reservation have 
been completed and nothing reportable was found or identified.  Each 
contractor is now preparing their reports and hopefully, will have them 
submitted to their mgt. for review in a couple of days and then issued to 
TW.  

The Forest Service has given us permission to do the arch survey for station 
2 on Monday.  The arch survey for station 1 is scheduled for Tuesday.   
Preliminary quotes for the surveys are $4-5000.00 for both sites.  The 
original word from them was 7-10 prior to giving approval.   This was 
definatley a plus.

Still no word on where the turbine buildings are to be located and what 
turbine equipment is to be installed at each facility.  GE or Rolls Royce.  
Additionally, confirmed decisions have not been made as to what auxillary 
power will be installed at each location (wind, natural gas, diesel).

After going through the Representative, Hot Line, and finally turning to the 
TIE
(yes , last resort). I have all my questions and concerns addressed. MP's 
using
the forum helped tremendously. However the written and phone discussions with 
a
NYISO staff person who took a lot of time and patience helped me understand,
while not the ideal solution, the combination of bid guarantees, bid baby
sitting, ECA's, and a healthy dose of caution , the resulting procedures are 
the
best that can be crafted at this time. Because of all the resultant phone 
calls
that will be generated from those who want to know more details on how to work
their bids, I have definitely decided NOT to disclose that Bob Thompson was 
the
one who helped me. I don't want  Bob Thompson's workload increase if it got 
out.
So that is why I won't mention Bob Thompson's name in conjunction with this
subject....And that's final! Thanks Bob.

Subject: TW Laguna Station Remediation

On Wednesday, October 20th, I contacted Ms. Barbara Bernacik at the Office of 
the Pueblo of Laguna, Division of Environment. I contacted Ms. Bernacik at 
the suggestion of Norm Gonzales (TW Laguna Team) to discuss outstanding 
environmental issues at the Station. 

In a conversation with Norm the previous week, Norm indicated to me that he 
had met with Ms. Bernacik and Ray Lucero (Engineer, Pueblo of Laguna) 
recently in regards to backfilling an open excavation which had been 
excavated in 1993 when a diesel UST was removed from the site. The excavation 
had not been backfilled pending authorization from the Pueblo of Laguna. This 
and other outstanding issues were discussed in a meeting with Ray Lucero, the 
Governor of the Pueblo of Laguna, Ted Ryther, Larry Campbell, Butch Russell, 
and myself back in 1995 but there was no resolution of the issues, primarily 
because at the time the Laguna's did not have an environmental staff person 
to address such issues. Subsequently, Ms. Bernacik was hired as the Laguna's 
environmental staff person about two years ago. 

In the course of Norm's conversation with Ms. Bernacik and Mr. Lucero, Mr. 
Lucero indicated some concern that the Pueblo of Laguna had not been kept 
apprised of environmental issues at the Station. In light of this, I have 
prepared a "Report of Groundwater Monitoring Activities". This report covers 
monitoring activities between June 1994 and June 1999. As previously 
mentioned, I also contacted Ms. Bernacik for the purpose of introducing 
myself and to inform her that a report has been prepared and will be 
delivered to her office. I also suggested that we meet at the site to discuss 
outstanding environmental issues. The response from Ms. Bernacik was very 
favorable and we agreed to meet at the site at 10:00 am November 16th. Ms. 
Bernacik also indicated that someone from the BIA will be with her.

Subject: Ground Water Contamination

George,  The Eunice Team has been activitly involved in the well testing for 
ground water contamination for quite    sometime now and know of some of the 
controversy regarding the Eunice Compressor Station.

  Recently Dynegy has undertaking a project to remove a 10" low pressure sour 
gas pipeline in the     Southwest area of our station outside of our fence 
line.  There are two monitoring wells in this location and    the presence 
of  contamination seems to be increasing in this area.  We took some 
pictures  of this area 
  while Dynegy was in the process of removing their pipe.  There appears to 
be quite abit of contamination    and seemed be generated by the condition of 
the pipe as you will see in the pictures.

  If you have any questions please give us a call.

  Thanks
  Ray Noseff

As discussed at the recent DES meeting, whenever you need the RO's signature, 
please use the attached form filled out as appropriate.  I need to review 
permit applications and permit renewals only.  I do not need to review annual 
compliance certifications, semiannual monitoring reports, emission test 
results and any other air related documents prior to getting the RO's 
signature.  (Make sure you remove my approval from the form for these 
documents.)  I would like a copy of these documents (electronic or paper) 
however.

Ruth

Absolutely - we can outline what it would take.  Greg Simmons definitely
said that it would be a congressional decision in D.C. - I asked him "what
about the 'energy initiative' and 'expedited review'" - he said that it
probably would not matter in this case - National Monuments are off limits
to new ROWs without an act of congress.

Larry, I got the sense that it is not impossible, but that it would be a
long, drawn out process, and would shoot the schedule all to hell.

By the way, I got a call back from Greg Simmons in the BLM State Office in
Arizona - my question to him was whether or not a proposed ROW across the
Agua Fria National Monument would constitute a "Fatal Flaw."  He indicated
that it likely would be a fatal flaw.  He said that it would take "an act
of
congress" literally, not figuratively, to put a pipeline across a National
Monument.  The boundary of the Monument is the east side of I 17, south of
Cordes Junction - I don't know if we can stay on the west side of the
Interstate there, but we might oughta check it out - it looks like we could
get into some pretty rough side-sloping, two-toning.  FYI.

As the Subject line would lead you to believe, I am attaching a further
refinement of our cost estimate, spread out over the life of the project.
I
know that you, Dave, requested a breakdown by personnel and hours, but I am
going to have to go home and pack for my trip.  We certainly can break this
down by personnel and hours, but I cannot do it tonight.  I apologize for
any inconvenience this may cause any of you.  Please remember that you can

sure the conversation will be lively, especially when Mitch gets going on 
"spanking." As Mitch says, it's a topic "for mature readers, so don't show it

Chad.J.Wagner@dynegy.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:


This raises concerns about what functions any ISO should take on in the
long run.  Here the ISO used its limited resources, ones which many members
want directed to specific high priority projects... such as virtual
bidding, to perform a study on ICAP that we did not know about until a
flurry of emails arrive.  The point is, the ISO better serves by focusing
its talent and limited time on facilitating the operation of a workable,
reliable, cost effective and efficient power market and by performing
studies consistent with member priorities.  Not by performing studies at
the request of one member, unless they are part of a clearly defined and
approved process like that for interconnections.  The ISO should work as a
"market facilitator," and as such expend its talents on providing accurate
and timely pricing, billing, and tracking of energy transactions within,
into, and out of New York.

The NYISO's need to periodically address market reliability issues and to
initiate studies should continue, in the near term.   Market participants
can raise concerns about reliability issues or submit studies they perform
to the ISO and if the ISO believes that they have merit, we can all review
and debate them and not be advantaged or disadvantaged by some activities
that the ISO decided to undertake with one member.  The ISO should not
pirate market participants' opportunities to analyze the dynamics of
generation availability, transmission, ICAP, and demand to discover areas
for investment.

What better stimulus than ROI is there to seek out opportunities and
eradicate inefficiencies in the market?  Let the market work, and the ISO
facilitate.

Inspected 3 filter cases down stream of Inlet separator at the SLX plant, all 
were still clean and dry. Got a slug of liquid in the Inlet filter separator 
at the SLX about 90 gallons. Did not get any further down stream, also took 
sample of it. See attached for our sample results for this month. PG&E are 
having problems with their phone lines so Sherwood labs could not fax their 
results. Therefor I don't have their results on the spred sheet.I will send 
them out as soon as I get them. Thanks,Randy

The following message has been forwarded to the Tech Exchange at the request 
of
Steven Keller of the NY PSC:


Statement of the Department of Public Service Staff to the BIC
Regarding Shortening the ICAP Obligation Procurement Period from Six
Months to One Month


The ICAP Working Group has proposed Phase II tariff language that
implements the BIC/MC decisions to implement a monthly ICAP obligation
procurement period (OPP) instead of the current six-month OPP.  It is our
understanding that this proposal is largely supported by incumbent load
serving entities who are currently required to purchase their ICAP six
month's in advance even though they expect to lose load to new entrants
during that period.  The LSE's are concerned that they may lose money
trying to sell unneeded ICAP back into the market.  Staff of the New York
State Department of Public Service (Staff) understands those concerns.

A report by the Brattle Group suggests that the existence of price caps in
New York could lead to capacity migration from New York under a one-month
OPP scenario.  Brattle suggests that under such a system certain
"optimistic" suppliers might choose not to offer to sell their ICAP to NY
if they think they could do better by selling energy into external markets
where they could earn high revenues in high demand month.   If that
happens, even to a limited extent, we believe it will likely result in
increased purchase costs for ICAP purchased both on a bilateral basis and
through the ISO auctions, and could also push up energy prices.

In a subsequent study by KEMA it is suggested that in order to avoid
capacity migration ICAP deficiency charges should be increased as much as
six-fold.  The obvious result would be that all LSE's would be exposed to
significantly higher deficiency charges under a
one-month OPP.  Staff does not view this as an acceptable alternative to
retaining a six-month OPP even with its potential that LSEs may incur a
loss as a result of purchasing ICAP for load they expect to lose.

As of November 29, 2000, the ISO has been unable to estimate the level of
deficiency penalties that would be required to avoid capacity migration
under a one-month OPP.  As a result, the New York State Department of
Public Service has been unable to verify whether the current levels need
to be increased, decreased or left as they are.  Because of concerns about
capacity migration, and because there is very little convincing argument
about the costs/benefits that would result from moving to a one-month ICAP
OPP that cannot at least partially be obtained from the six month OPP with
monthly deficiency auctions, Staff is opposed to such a change at this
time.   Until the ISO and market participants work out how to ensure that
energy and ICAP markets will remain workably competitive even during peak
periods, we believe it is prudent to move cautiously with regard to
shortening the OPP.

Here are my comments on the Draft Permits:

1.  EPA did not include the stain tube request for sulfur monitoring.  The 
methods that are currently listed are wet chemistry methods.  As we 
discussed, since the permit allows us to use an APPROVED, alternate method, 
we will need to submit this request at some time.  For the time being, since 
we want to receive this permit ASAP we should be able to accept the permit as 
is.
2.  It is my understanding that the limits given on CO and NOx are based on 
ppm @ 15% O2 and not going to the full ISO conversion.  We may want to double 
check that with the agency.   Arnold -- Do we have guarantees from GE to back 
up these limits?
3.  The responsible official should be Dan Pribble.

Ruth

The EPA has posted the draft permits for C/S 3 and 4 on their web page for 
review. To review each permit go to 
http://www.epa.gov/region09/air/permit/epssdata.htm .  Click on the first 
yellow bullet and drill move down to Arizona, then click the yellow button 
for US EPA.  This will make available the files which are labeled 
Transwestern Pipeline Company Klagetoh Compressor Station and Transwestern 
Pipeline Company Luepp Compressor Station.  For each file, click on the field 
labeled "link permit conditions". this will present the draft permit 
conditions.  Due to the urgency of each permits review, Id like comments from 
Jon and Ruth to me by tomorrow prior to the afternoon phone call I will have 
with the state of Arizona over the draft conditions for the permits for C/S 1 
and 2.

rbowers@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

On April 24, 2001, the NYISO deployed code changes affecting Class 1 PURPA
transactions in the billing system and modified bid status flagging in the 
MIS.
These changes impacted settlements for 4/10, 4/11, 4/13, and 4/18 - forward.

There was a code design problem with the PURPA code change that resulted in an
error in the computation of balancing energy for some class 1 units that
resulted in their purchasing their entire day-ahead schedules in the balancing
market.  There was also an oversight in the implementation of the modified bid
status flagging in the MIS such that those bids were not transferred into the
billing system, impacting bid production cost guarantee settlements for the
units with a modified bid status.

The NYISO will be issuing a supplemental invoice for April 2001 settlements on
Tuesday, May 15th to adjust for the aforementioned issues.  Funds due the 
NYISO
for this supplemental invoice should be transferred into the NYISO Clearing
Account by close of business Wednesday, May 23, 2001.  Funds due Market
Participants from the NYISO for this supplemental invoice will be transferred
into Market Participant accounts by close of business Friday, May 25, 2001.

PLEASE NOTE THAT: Funds due the NYISO for the April 2001 settlements which 
were
invoiced on May 7, 2001 should be transferred into the NYISO Clearing Account 
by
close of business Wednesday, May 16, 2001, as scheduled.  Funds due Market
Participants from the NYISO for the April 2001 settlements invoiced on May 7,
2001 will be transferred into Market Participant accounts by close of business
Monday, May 21, 2001, as scheduled.

OK, around 8/30, I'll call...
Unless you object, I'll use EPA's TANKS 4.09 program to calculate annual
emissions (and emission fees, @$26/ton) for the sites that have a tank
subject to NSPS K/Ka/Kb.   This won't take long.

I'm a little anxious about McElroy tank 58005.

Mr. Campbell,

Here is my review of the Kingman Class I permit.  Please review my review of
the transition period operating hour limitations.  If my logic is correct I
can't see why ADEQ would limit us to 2000 hours per engine.  Using their
numbers it appears to me that allowing us to operate 4,380 hours (as
originally requested) would not cause an exceedance in the PSD levels.

Let me know if you have any additional comments.  I'm reviewing the
Flagstaff permit now.

The state of Texas conducted an air quality inspection of the NNG Seminole 
C/S.  There were no deficiencies or violations identified at the facilit 
during the inspection.

The State of New Mexico Air Quality Bureau conducted an inspection of the 
Transwestern Atoka No. 3 C/S.  The Agency conducted a record review and did 
portable emissions testing of 3 of the 5 emissions units at the facility.  
Although fuel use and a natural gas analysis were not available for the units 
tested, emissions exceedances for NOx are expected for the 2 White Superiors 
at the facility.  

The State of New Mexico Air Quality Buureau conducted an inspection of the 
Transwestern Atoka No. 2 C/S.  The agency conducted a portable emissions 
testing of the two turbines and one recip at the facility.  Although fuel use 
and a natural gas analysis was not available at the facility, all units 
tested  appeared to be in compliance with the permit limits.  The agency 
requested sulfur readings from the fuel gas as required under Subpart GG NSPS 
for the last twelve months.  The Artesia team has contacted Gas Control in 
Houston for the for the monthly sulfur values at the facility.

Subject: BTU factor


Due to internal issues, the BTU factor, previously reported to the marketers
for the month of August 2000 as 1.027, was incorrect.


The correct BTU factor for August 2000 is 1.029.

Any questions may be directed to my attention.

Larry - Sue has done an nice job of providing an outline of what is 
required.  As you will see do not worry about the 30 day rule for materials 
that we are not actively managing.  When you see the timetable for the EPA to 
respond you will realize that....

this is a big help but a lot of work is required and we will need Donna 
Mullins to sign off on what we discussed....

Subject: PCB Cleanup Under the Mega Rule

Lou - 

Attached is a revised version of the bulleted document I created addressing 
characterization and cleanup of PCB contaminated concrete.  I revised the 
document to include contaminated soils (i.e., bulk remediation waste) and 
additional information about cleanup levels.

Generally - My understanding of the rules is that EPA requires cleanup to 100 
ppm in low occupancy areas if the contaminated area is capped and deed 
recorded.  Disposal in place of PCBs at concentrations higher than 100 ppm 
requires written EPA approval.

Sue

Just to keep all permit information together, I spoke to Roger Kohn and he
has sent to me the station 3 and 4 air permits.  We are now free to
initiate construction at these two sites....

Subject:  ADEQ permits: public hearing


As Larry has probably reported to you by now, the public hearing last night
in Williams was accomplished with a satisfactory result. Shudeish had
copies of the draft permits, which Larry reviewed and found satisfactory.
Apparently, about three weeks ago, Prabhat Bargava left his DEQ position as
Section Manager, Compliance, to take a position with a consultant, CH2M
Hill, which is trying to start an air group in Arizona.
I just spoke with Shudeish about how soon the actual permits will be
issued. He said that DEQ had to wait a few days after the November 23 close
of the comment period (this was announced at the hearing) to allow mailed
comments postmarked on Friday, Nov 23 to reach DEQ. He then said that he
expected both permits would be issued middle to end of next week (by Nov.
30): he said he had to blend the EPA issues into the permits, but that was
not problemmatic. Larry talked with Shudeish last night about the EPA
issues, and that did not seem to be any difficulty.
I then asked Shudeish why the comment period was extended until Nov 23 when
the rule states that the comment period is only 30 days long and the
comment period opened by first publication on October 17. The public
hearing also must be no sooner than 30 days after first publication, and
that is why it was set for Nov. 19. Thus, even allowing for a couple of
days after what should have been the close of comment period (Nov 19,
because Nov 17 was a Saturday), the permits should be issued by the first
of next week rather than the end of the week. Shudeish said he would check
and get back to me.
I know this is only a couple of days difference (assuming the permits are
issued by Nov 30), but I am sensitive to Jerry's urgency to get moving
quickly, and I also want to lay some groundwork to object if actual
issuance starts dragging.
Please let me know if you have any thoughts or comments.

Larry-
Remediation efforts to remove PSH have gone well recently and it is now time 
to focus more attention toward remediation of the dissolved phase plume. This 
is reflected in the proposed scope.

Two files are attached. The first file includes a project scope and cost 
estimate for 2001. The second file contains photos of the site. 

The cost estimate is $93,000. This figure includes only contract installation 
dollars, so the work order amount would be about 20-30% more than this. The 
bulk of this figure ($53,000) is for system modifications to focus more 
attention toward remediation of the dissolved phase plume. 

If you get a chance to look at the photos, be sure to look at the last photo. 
This photo shows the interior of the SVE knockout box that was installed in 
Dec 1999 in the NE pit area. This installation has worked very well over the 
past two winter periods and has greatly increased the effectiveness of the 
SVE system. The SVE knockout box recently installed at the N Crawar site is 
nearly identical. 

Give me a call and lets discuss.

-George

Subject: NYISO Newsflash: External load a good deal



All,
?
You may already be  aware of this, but NYISO staff just revealed in a meeting 
that significant  opportunities exist to purchase in real time from the NYISO 
LBMP market at the  PJM proxy bus (i.e., as an external load), due to the 
impact of ECA 1006B.?  When the tie is import constrained in BME, prices 
there since the 1006 ECAs were  implemented have been as low as -$1000.? In 
this case the BME price would  be used for settlement, and you would be paid 
$1000/MWh to export power there  (as your export would offset inbound 
congestion).
?
As more people begin  to take advantage of this, the BME prices can be 
expected to be less  negative.
?
Caution!? If  you schedule a transaction DA, but it fails the DA checkout, 
when there is  congestion on the ties in BME, you will have to settle the 
difference at the BME  price, and could get hammered.
?
NYISO will probably  issue a bulletin about this later today.
?
Scott

Larry -  thanks for 1999 and 2000 Conway and Belvieu prices. Attached is
the rest of the story. Compares those historic prices with equivalent value
of liquids as gas based on historic gas (Calif Socal Border) prices.  As we
suspected, values are negative (i.e. less value as gas) up until recently
and then the numbers turn very positive. i.e. Needles blending project does
not work on historic liquids/gas prices but certainly works now. Therefore,
back to the question of what is price forecast or spreads we can lock into.
I have been given a contact on the Enron gas desk that maybe able to help.

Dear Market Participants,

- At about 6:30PM (1830) on November 22, 2000 the Production
Mainframe was restarted at the request of the Shift Supervisor
(for time not updating on screens).

- The Mainframe-Spider Data Exchange (DEX) did not initialize
correctly at that time causing a failure to send any 5-min data
(MWs and LBMPs)  to the MIS.

- The problem was finally corrected at approximately 7:15PM (1914)
which re-established the DEX.

- We have been able to reconstruct the LBMPs that were calculated
during this problem period, as well as the PTS data.

- This data was posted and the final billing for Nov will include this data.

Regards,
Customer Relations

Larry,
I think you should go forward with the meeting to show that this is a 
critically important issue for TWP. I hope that Sarah can be there, but if 
she can't, is there another person in addition to yourself? Assuming Prabat 
joins Shudeish, we had anticipated this as the first step, particularly 
because we would like to resolve this with the "first-line" regulators for 
long-term good relations; Steve Burr will be cheering us on from the 
sidelines, to the extent he is consulted. If the first meeting is a 
stonewall, we then have to go to Cathy and Nancy, but let's make the first 
effort with Shudeish & Prabat.
A couple of thoughts. ADEQ was required to give a completeness notice within 
41 days of the application, at the latest; altho this time frame may not have 
been met, it may have been because of follow-up questions on the netting 
calculation. Also, was there any discussion whether any of the following 
applied:
     a. Facility change allowed w/o permit revision (R18-2-317)
     b. Minor permit revision (R18-2-319.A), which could shorten EPA review 
time and possibly avoid a public hearing
     c. Accelerated processing (R18-2-326.N)
These may have been hashed out in pre-application meetings, and water under 
the bridge now, particularly because it appears that ADEQ is viewing these as 
NEW permits (compare the numbers on DEQ's completeness determination letters 
with the numbers on the "permit revision applications"), but the story of net 
benefits to air quality, as well as the need to improve energy supply to 
California, should be persuasive factors to get this back to head of the 
line, as you had been told in the spring. It may be that Shudeish and Prabat 
need to be reminded of the benign nature of this equipment change-over.
Bottom line, I think you should go forward Thursday if that is the only day 
available this week. It is important that TWP know what barriers stand in the 
way of prompt evaluation and that TWP offer what assistance it can in 
overcoming those barriers. It is important also that ADEQ understand that 
there are a number of actions that TWP wants to initiate in order to meet the 
project schedule that it had developed last spring when it received initial 
assurances of prompt review. [can you send me that list?] If Shudeish and 
Prabat are to be barriers, it is important to know as soon as possible so we 
can start moving up the chain.
There are, in fact, a number of energy projects gearing up in Arizona now, 
and the Corporation Commission's Facility Siting Committee is taking a 
pro-environment bent (following the Calif AQMDs), but a number of these 
projects also are dealing with county, rather than state, permits.
I will be available Thursday to take before and/or after the DEQ meeting.

Shudeish with the state of Arizona just phoned and said that he and Probaht
Baragava are available to meet with us on Thursday at 2:00 pm.  This is the
only time and day of this week that they will be able to see us.  I asked
about whether Kathy OConnell and Nancy Wrona would be able to attend this
meeting and he stated that their calendars were full this week and would
not attend.   He will need to know by tomorrow whether to book this meeting
and who will be attending.  Sarah had mentioned that Thrusday was not a
good day for her.  Should we schedule this and if so, who will be attending
in Sarah's place?

Subject:  Telephone Conversation with EPA

After the telephone conference call we had on 9/17, I contacted the Roger
Kohn permit engineer with EPA about a possible meeting with his agency to
resolve and assist the issuance of the air permits for stations 3 and 4.
His message back to me was a reiteration of the last request I made to him,
that he could see no way that Transwestern would be able to help the EPA in
this matter.  We discussed the possibility of Transwestern contacting his
supervisor, Gerardo Rios, about a potential meeting and he indicated that
we could choose this avenue if we desired.

Gerardo's telephone number is 415-744-1259.

I contacted Jim Saddler with AcuVac regarding rental rates on his SVE 
equipment (S.A.V.E. systems). He indicated that rental on a single unit would 
be $5000 per month and rental on two units would be $4000-$4500 per unit per 
month. I also contacted Baker Furnace regarding rental of comparable SVE 
equipment and they indicated that rental would be $3000 per month. In light 
of this, I suggest we establish a rental rate for the TW units, as is, at 
$2500 per unit per month. 

I also discussed costs associated with refurbishing old units with John Sachs 
at Baker Furnace. John indicated that they have already replaced the old 
Baker Fax telemetry systems with Sensaphone 2000 systems on several used 
units. He also indicated the various options they have for silencing the 
units. It can be done, but apparently, adding silencers to the blower is not 
a simple modification.

We are set up to move the units to Midland next week, but I think we should 
strongly consider shipping the units back to Baker Furnace for these 
modifications. John indicated that they could turn them around in about two 
weeks. Allowing for shipping time, this would place the units back in Midland 
around June 20th (a more realistic date would be June 30th). A rough cost 
estimate is $18000 ($7000 per unit plus $4000 shipping). I believe this would 
save both time and cost compared to trying to do the modifications in 
Midland. We would also end up with "good as new" units. As a compromise 
between EOTT and TW, if EOTT would pick up the costs for the refurbishing 
then TW could lower the rental rate to something on the order of $2000 per 
unit per month.

Sta.3, 4 and 5

As you may know, we are at the end of our grace period for not being required 
to do monthly sampling for the public water systems at sta. 3,4 and 5.  Jeff 
Lobstein has been requested to do the monthly drinking water sample 
collections at  each of the three compressor station and has three months 
completed.  This memo is a reminder that each location is again required to 
send their drinking water analytical reports to the following agencies on a 
monthly basis as the analytical results are received at each compressor 
station.     

Stations 3 and 4:   each months reports are to be sent to the following 2 
agencies:

 Navajo Nation EPA
 P.O. Box 339
 Window Rock, AZ 86515

 Atten: Yolanda Barney   Program Manager


 US EPA    Region IX
 75 Hawthorne Street
 San Francisco, CA 94105

 Atten: Danny Collier (WTR-6)


Station 5:    your water sample reports are to be sent to the Navajo Nation 
EPA in Window Rock, AZ, only.  In speaking with Charlie, he has indicated 
that he will be handling  the reporting for Station 4 also.

I have contacted Nortest in Flagstaff (520) 774-2312, which is the lab 
selected to do the testing to send station 3 reports to station 3 and station 
4 and 5 reports to station 5.

The Navajo Nation has been given primacy and will be taking over the drinking 
water program for the Navajo Nation in November of this year.  Expect some 
changes in reporting.   Youmay want  to use MCS as a monthly reminder for the 
submittal of the reports.  Questions, give me a call  505 625-8022..

I obtained a copy of a letter sent to Gary Fuller from the Department of
Fish and Game on November 3, 2000. In the letter the Fish and Game agreed
EOTT has 41 Acres of conservation credits based on Arco Western Energy's
sale of the North Coles Levee fractionator plant and premises to Koch Oil
and Gas, and Koch's subsequent sale of the plant and premises to EOTT
ENERGY.

In the letter the following limitations and clarifications were listed:

Because the conservation credits may be used for mitigation of EOTT
impacts, or sold by EOTT to third parties for their own mitigation needs,
EOTT must affirm that it will conform to the Department's  standards for
sale of conservation credits as well as management of the credit lands.

These obligations are already implied by the chain of Koch's and then
EOTT's acquisitions  of the North Coles Levee fractionator plant. EOTT and
Department representatives will need to meet to discuss these details and
determine the most efficient means to implement these conditions.

Key provision of the obligations that attend using the conservation credits
include Department approval of third-party sales;  minimum endowment
requirements for all credit sales; management and monitoring of habitat
conditions; and additional mitigation for disturbance to dedicated habitat.

Habitat continuity and small animal movement between the North Coles
fractionator plant site and the remainder of Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve
must be provided in order to maintain viability of the habitat within
EOTT's holdings.

 Although it appears we do have the credits for NCL, I do not know if Gary
ever met with the Fish and Game to discuss the details or means to
implement the conditions for use of the conservation credits. With the
project set to start we may have to purchase the 15.3 acres of credit from
Area.

Kenny and Scott,

I agree with Ed's note concerning the need to move expeditiously in the
purchase of compensation acreage noted by the US Fish and Wildlife Service
(Service) in there approval letter.  This in indeed "good news" and EOTT
must move ahead to fulfill its obligation as per the MOU and Incidental
Take Permit.  By copy of this email, I am asking Larry Campbell to work
with both of you to assist in the proper fulfillment of EOTT's obligation
as promptly as possible.

It is also my understanding, from what research I have been able to do,
that EOTT does have approximately 14 to 15 acres of credit at the North
Coles Levee Preserve.  You should verify the exact credit number and
furnish the Service with such verification.  That is acreage EOTT will not
have to purchase in satisfying the obligation of the permit.

Keep me posted as you move forward on this issue.  John Shafer

Subject:  Rogas Line -- USFW Approval


     Randi McCormick just forwarded to me a letter addressed to EOTT, dated
February 14, 2001  from the US Fish and Wildlife Service approving our
project "for participation in the Kern Water Bank Compensation Bank," and
authorizing the Water Bank "to extend their incidental take authority to
you and your entire project under their Master Permit."  This is, of
course, very good news.

     The letter notes, however, that we still need to purchase compensation
acreage both at North Coles Levee and at the Kern Water Bank.
Specifically, we must do the following:  (1) contact Cheryl Harding of Kern
Water Bank to acquire 23.1 acres of compensation credits, and to get
included in their Master Permit; and (2) get Cheryl Harding a letter from
the Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve (Mark Poe of Aera) stating that we have
purchased 15.3 acres of credits for North Coles Levee, or that we have set
aside that amount from credits we have in the past purchased.

     While I could make these contacts, I do not believe that would be wise
because -- as Kenny can attest -- our past experience has been that
whenever a lawyer contacts the Water Bank, it prompts them to automatically
get their lawyers involved.  And our experience has been that this only
slows things down -- or worse.

     My suggestion therefore is that one or both of you gentlemen contact
Cheryl as soon as practical and ask her for (1) proposed contract for
acquisition of 23.1 acres of compensation credits and (2) perperwork to
include EOTT (and its contractors) in their Master Permit.  She should also
be informed that, while we have not yet purchased the 15.3 acres of NCL
credits, we will by the end of this week have a letter of credit posted as
security, as allowed under our State Take Permit, to cover this amount of
acreage.  Ask whether a copy of this LC will suffice for her purposes, or
whether we will need to have the actual acreage purchased.

     As this would remove a major impediment to construction of the new
lines, it is important that we move on this will all deliberate speed.
Please call me if you have any questions, or if you would like otherwise to
discuss how to approach this issue.  Thanks a lot.

                          --ETA

5/16 - Trans Id. 5062820 shows 1033 mw R/T but we do not show this in 
EnPower.  However, deal 613492 in EnPower for 1270 mw does not go with

Dear George
I trust all is well. In advance of Kemm's presentation to your team on

VICE PRESIDENT GORE
I fight for the chickens and I am fighting for the chickens right now. I
will not give up on the chickens crossing the road!  I will fight for the
chickens and I will not disappoint them.

GOVERNOR GEORGE W. BUSH
I don't believe we need to get the chickens across the road.  I say give
the road to the chickens and let them decide.  The government needs to let
go of strangling the chickens so they can get across
the road.

SENATOR LIEBERMAN
I believe that every chicken has the right to worship their God In their
own way.  Crossing the road is a spiritual journey and no chicken should be
denied the right to cross the road in their own
way.

SECRETARY CHENEY
Chickens are big-time because they have wings. They could fly if they
wanted to.  Chickens don't want to cross the road.  They don't need help
crossing the road.  In fact, I'm not interested in crossing the road
myself.

RALPH NADER
Chickens are misled into believing there is a road by the evil
tiremakers. Chickens aren't ignorant, but our society pays tiremakers to
create the need for these roads and then lures chickens into believing
there is an advantage to crossing them.  Down with the roads, up with
chickens.

PAT BUCHANAN
To steal a job from a decent, hardworking American.

JERRY FALWELL
Because the chicken was gay!  Isn't it obvious? Can't you people See the
plain truth in front of your face?  The chicken was going to the "other
side." That's what "they" call it-the "other side." Yes, my friends, that
chicken is gay.  And, if you eat that chicken, you
will become gay too.  I say we boycott all chickens until we sort out
this abomination that the liberal media whitewashes with seemingly harmless
phrases like "the other side." That chicken should not be free to cross the
road.  It's as plain and simple as that.

DR.  SEUSS
Did the chicken cross the road?  Did he cross it with a toad?  Yes!  The
chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed, I've not been told!

ERNEST HEMINGWAY
To die.  In the rain.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.
I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross without having
their motives called into question.

GRANDPA
In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road.  Someone told us
that the chicken crossed the road,and that was good enough for us.

ARISTOTLE
It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.

KARL MARX
It was a historical inevitability.

SADDAM HUSSEIN
This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified in
dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.

RONALD REAGAN
What chicken?

CAPTAIN JAMES T.  KIRK
To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.

FOX MULDER
You saw it cross the road with your own eyes. How many more chickens
have to cross before you believe it?

FREUD
The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road
reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.

BILL GATES
I have just released eChicken 2000, which will not only cross roads, but
will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook
-and Internet Explorer is an inextricable part of eChicken.

EINSTEIN
Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road move beneath the
chicken?

BILL CLINTON
I did not cross the road with THAT chicken.  What do you mean by
"chicken"? Could you define "chicken" please?

GEORGE BUSH
I don't think I should have to answer that question.

LOUIS FARRAKHAN
The road, you will see, represents the black man. The chicken crossed
the "black man" in order to trample him and keep him down.


COLONEL SANDERS
I missed one?

The issues discussed during the May 1, 2000 environmetnal conference call  
were as follows:

Home Officing- Employees within OTS and EHS have been asked to pilot a 
telecommunicating and home officing program.  The reson being to make 
available desirable office space within the Enron, Three Allen Center and 
Brookhollow office buildings.

MIke Terraso's Replacement-    John Shafer has been selected to replace Mike 
Terraso as V.P. of GPG for Environmental and Safety.  John was formerly 
Director of Environmetnal and Safety for ANR Pipeline out of Chicago, Ill.  
John will assume responsibilities within Enron on May 8.

Performance Testing of Grandfathered Units-   There was some confusion with 
repsect to the internal position within GPG of testing grandfathered units.  
It was understood by some team members that internal portable emissions 
testing would only occur if the grandfathered unit had permitted limits on an 
air permit  or if there was a special need by the DES.  In order to clarify 
this issue, Bill will discuss this with legal and distribute a notice to the 
appropriate individuals within GPG outlining the GPG position on testing . 

Skill Base Pay- Bill is suggesting a reworking of the O&M, field trainee, and 
Level I, II and III training modules and TV Guides by the SBP review 
committee.  Bill will distribute to the committee existing documents for 
reworking and revision.  The committee will reveiw, make changes and return 
back to Bill by the mid term review meeting.

O&G MACT-    Bill will approach Marc Phillips about conducting an internal 
training for all DES personal on the forthcoming notification and conditions 
of the Oil and Gas MACT regulation and its applicability to the facilities in 
GPG.  Bill will notify each DES as to when the meeting is scheduled and 
where.  An Enron letter will be developed and distributed to the field by 5/5 
to notify EPA of those facilities which are impacted by the new MACT 
regulations.  It will be the DES's responsibility to make the notification to 
the EPA.

MId Term Peer Review Meeting-   Bill Kendrick, Rick Cates and Ken Crowl will 
keep the DES's apprised of the details relevant to the mid term review 
process and procedures to be employed for doing the review.

Cooling Tower Issue-     A request was made by BIll Kendrick to send legal a 
list of histortic or active cooling tower sites within GPG, that may have 
impacted groundwater at a site.   The criteria to be used for this 
notification is knowledge of chromate use in the cooling tower and/or  
relative proximity to a nearby recptor (drinking water well). 

Tracking Cleanup Costs-    MIke Terraso has requested work orders to be 
generated for tracking costs associated with cleanup and remedation of spills 
and releases.  The "cut line" for the work order generation is $1,000.

If the bottom line is being able to start critical construction activities as 
quickly as possible, rather than properly characterizing the type of permit 
revision, we have developed an argument, based on the Clean Air Act (which is 
the source for Arizona's air program), that would allow construction to 
commence shortly after notice, without the need for a permit. Of course, TWP 
has already submitted a permit revision application and would be willing to 
see this process through to completion as long as TWP could begin 
construction promptly and plan on beginning operation of the new equipment 
when the permit is finallly issued, presumably in the spring.

The argument goes as follows: under CAA sec 502(b)(10), 42 USC 7661a(b)(10),  
a state program needs to allowchanges within a permitted facility if the 
changes are not "modifications" and do not exceed the emissions allowable 
under the permit. A "modification" is defined as "any physical change in, or 
change in the method of operation of, a stationary source which increases the 
amount of any air pollutant emitted by such source or which results in the 
emission of any air pollutant not previously emitted."

 Someone should confirm the technical status of the equipment changes and 
whether they meet the criteria. This may be something to point out to Nancy 
how she can exercise her discretion to get us where we need to go. Nancy can 
give this approval after Shudeish completes his calculations confirming TWP's 
netting calculations.

I've emailed my friend my review for Finding Forrester, starring Sean
Connery, Anna Paquin and newcomer Rob Brown.  You can wait until he posts
the review on his website or just email me for the review.  I think he's
pretty busy since he hasn't posted my review for Unbreakable yet.

In any case, the url for the movie review site is:
http://users.ev1.net/~solt/movie_menu.html

book mark it and check back for reviews of future movies.

Hi Larry,

We are sending this quick note to our diamond customers who are still 
shopping to let you know that the holiday rush has begun.  If you are hoping 
to present your special gift before Christmas, be aware that while we can get 
diamonds in quickly the calendar is getting short for getting a custom 
mounting made.  In another week it will become difficult to get diamonds 
quickly set in mounting.  What normally takes 2-3 days suddenly turns into a 
week long process as the setters are buried with ring sizing, diamond setting 
and other jewelry preparation for the big gift giving days.

If you are planning on presenting your gift after Christmas, you'll have 
plenty of time but the supply of diamonds is as good now as it will be until 
early February.  Unlike cars, TV sets and computers that come down in price 
when the snow falls or following Christmas, we have yet to see diamond prices 
fall.  They tend to keep going up year after year which is good if you own 
them, but a challenge if you are waiting to buy.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST (Mon-Sat) since we are dealing with customers 
and suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always 
want to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs 
and answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Repayment Procedure  

I called MAPP to get a better understanding of the pending Dec. 18th LRP 
changes as explained in detail below.
Currently the "source" generator is responsible for the Losses.  The new 
policy states that the Scheduling customer is now responsible for Losses.  
MAPP is implementing this change as a requirement under their tariff.  
Changes to software and systems has delayed this change from being 
implemented any earlier.
What it means to Enron as a Schedule F customer:
 1)  Enron (or any Schedule F customer) is responsible for  losses based on a 
yet to be published Loss Matrix that MAPP will provide on it web page.  The 
loss  calculation matrix and methodolgy will not change, just the party 
responsible for providing the losses.  When scheduling energy, Enron must  
either schedule physical losses or buy losses from a designated Source 
Scheduling participant (SSP).  The SSP will then be responsible for 
disbursing the losses to each designated CA a week later.
The identity of the SSP will be the Source of power (if a MAPP member), or 
the POR on your Schedule F (If Source is outside MAPP).

Repayment Procedure


Notice of new MAPP Loss Repayment Policies and Procedures

At the direction of the Regional Transmission Committee of MAPP, new Loss
Repayment Policies and Procedures will be implemented on December 18, 2000.
These changes make the transmission customer, as identified on the OASIS
reservation, responsible for paying energy losses on MAPP Schedule F
transmission service.  Previously, the MAPP Source entity has been
responsible for paying these losses.  These changes do not modify the
application of MAPP's Loss Repayment Procedure (LRP) to MAPP Member Open
Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) customers.  Changes to the administration
of Schedule F loss repayment include:
o The Schedule F transmission customer will now be responsible for the LRP
losses on their energy schedules.
o Payment of third party impacts due to "through flowing" Schedule F
transactions (where the Source and Sink are both outside MAPP) will be
included in the LRP.
o To facilitate the payment of third party losses, the Customer will make
arrangements with the Source Scheduling Participant (SSP), as defined on the
transmission reservation, to pay for energy transaction losses at the onset
of a schedule.
o The SSP will bank the losses for repayment of third party losses, one week
later, to the day. The repayment is done, as it is today, according to a
schedule sent out by the MAPP Center.
For additional information please see the business practices section of
MAPP's Schedule F OASIS:

Can someone shed any light on how much generation was on May 1 out of
merit?  I thought all such requests, whether by the Transmission
Provider or the ISO, were to be posted on the Dispatcher Notices.  There
were no notices posted between 04:03:58 and 21:50:53.  In that time
period I had gas turbines requested on by the ISO out of merit for 7
hours.  Was this done on a larger scale or was this an isolated
incident?

Larry, per our phone conversation tonight.  I found this article interesting, 
especially in light of potential future expansions on TW.  Note the section 
below in bold Red text.  Camp Navajo is nearly due South of Station 2 just 
across Interstate 40 and as you know, Kachina Village is South of Flagstaff 
off Interstate 15.  This may or may not pose any direct threats to TW ROW's 
but, it does give us a flavor of public sentiment with regards to conserving 
these areas.....   Anyhow, fyi...  (Oh yea, The Grand Canyon Trust & The 
Nature Conservancy in Flagstaff share the same office building)  



New land pegged for preservation


By ANNE MINARD
Sun Staff Reporter
07/29/2001

  |
Reader Comments

It's been less than a year since Arizona voters narrowly
rejected Proposition 100, a plan to protect 290,000
acres of State Trust Land from development.
And in about a month, voters could be asked to begin
signing petitions to get another initiative on the
ballot that would protect significantly more of the
state's legacy -- 1 million acres, or about 10 percent,
including thousands of acres in and around Flagstaff.

The difference, conservationists say, is that this land
has been chosen with the goal of protecting biologically
and aesthetically important areas. The environmental
community rallied against Prop. 100 because they said
the lands chosen for protection were insufficient and
had little value for conservation.

For example, the Proposition 100 campaign identified 10
acres of Rio De Flag in east Flagstaff -- near a
wastewater treatment plant outflow -- as one of the
state's "crown jewels" needing to be preserved.

Two other parcels in the Flagstaff area included 15
acres on Wildcat Hill with an unimpressive view of an
industrial park and 269 acres of steep slopes littered
with shot-up refrigerators and television sets called
Turkey Hills.

Rogers Lake, an important wetland and major ecosystem
south of Flagstaff, was also slated for preservation
under Prop 100. But that plan only included its soggy
lakebed, while 2,000 acres of highly developable
shoreline owned by the State Trust Land Department was
still up for grabs.

THE NEW PLAN

The new initiative would include all areas around Rogers
Lake, excluding those that are private or held by the
U.S. Forest Service. One proposed parcel does still fall
in the Turkey Hills area, and three others lie between
Flagstaff proper and Walnut Canyon (not included is
Section 20, which is likely to be sold and developed,
but at densities that are still in dispute between the
county and the city).

Other areas would include parcels around Observatory
Mesa (a contiguous chunk of land south and west of the
Naval Observatory) and a checkerboard pattern of
sections -- interspersed with Forest Service land --
south of Camp Navajo and west of Kachina Village and
Griffiths Spring.

Like Prop. 100, an initiative would be only a first
step. If it were to appear on the ballot and then pass,
it would take an act of Congress, and a constitutional
amendment, to change the availability of State Trust
Lands.

State Trust Lands include about 135 million acres across
the country -- 9.3 million in Arizona -- originally
allocated by the federal government when each state was
formed to help fund public schools. (See related story
on Page A11.)

Brad Ack, program director for the Flagstaff-based Grand
Canyon Trust who is helping spearhead the initiative,
said the state's schools shouldn't be bought and paid
for with proceeds from unmanaged sprawl. Areas set aside
under the initiative could still be leased for grazing,
agriculture or other current uses -- but they would
never be sold for commercial development.

Making an informed decision to set aside designated
State Trust Lands will free others from the battles that
now accompany proposals to develop them, he said.

The initiative is a collaborative effort between the
Grand Canyon Trust and other conservation groups, along
with some business and development affiliates.

And supporters are touting a recent poll conducted by
the Grand Canyon Trust, the Sonoran Institute in Tucson
and the Nature Conservancy that showed 88 percent of
Arizona voters agreed that some of Arizona's State Trust
Land should be conserved.

TALKING COMPENSATION

But members of the State Department of Lands charged
with managing the tracts -- and a lobbyist for
superintendents and principals in the state's school
system -- say the initiative backers are missing the
mark in the state land debate.

"We have a fundamental difference of opinion with our
friends in the environmental community," said Mike
Smith, a contract lobbyist for the Arizona School
Administrator Association. "Preserve, set aside ... we
think those are great ideas. The question is
compensation. Those State Trust Lands are in trust for
the schools. It's acutely important for schools to
maximize the returns on state lands."

Smith acknowledged that the awareness of their legacy is
new for the state's schools. Until recently, the schools
didn't see a whole lot of benefit from the state trusts.

"We haven't seen any of it. The state Legislature has
taken the annual earnings, and has used it to reduce
state aid coming out of the general fund."

That all changed with the passage of Proposition 301,
passed last year, he said.

"In addition to increasing sales tax for the schools ...
they also said, 'By the way, all new earnings from the
state trust fund go into the school site fund.' All of a
sudden, it's real different for us. Before it supplanted
our funding, now it will supplement it. It's real money
to us."

The Legislature will still keep the money it has been
earning from State Trust Lands -- about $80 million a
year. But anything above that mark will now go to the
schools, and both Smith and Nick Simonetta, manager of
communications and legislative affairs for the Arizona
Department of Lands, are optimistic that figure will
climb rapidly in the coming years. Simonetta estimates
the schools could see $650 million in addition to
legislative appropriations over the next decade.

LOOKING BACK

But the past irregularities are a stronghold for
conservationists who are promoting the land reform
initiative.

In background literature for its State Trust Land Reform
Initiative, the Grand Canyon Trust says that the State
Trust Lands haven't been used as they were intended
anyway, and very little money has gone to Arizona
schools.

"State Trust Lands currently provide less than 2 percent
of the annual funding for public education," the
document reads. "... there is little, if any, direct
benefit from State Trust Lands to our public schools."

Simonetta said he strongly disagrees with that
assessment.

"I think those statements are severely misleading and
not reflective of what is currently the case. You can
throw around percentages any way you want. If you look
at what the trust has been contributing to the school
construction budget, it's more like 30 or 40 percent."

Regardless, Simonetta and Smith agree that the future of
State Trust Land will rest on its ability to generate
funds -- and won't be given away for free.

"It comes down to this: We are in intense discussion
with the conservation community," Smith said. "Our
conversations are all around the question of
compensation. We are not going to support any initiative
that contemplates setting aside State Trust Land without
compensation. You can take that non-support as far as
you like. If they attempt to go to Congress, we are
going with them."

While there is a wealth of information about the various
definition of ideal cut round brilliant diamonds, most consumers
have no idea what constitutes great cut for the fancy cut
diamonds such as pear, heart, oval, marquise, princess, emerald
or radiant.  There is no one industry standard for round let
alone fancy cuts, but there are some specific guidelines that we
use when we search for diamond.

Each fancy shape has its own set of depth percentage, table
percentage, crown height percentage and length to width ratio
that will increase the likelihood that the diamond will have
great brilliance, sparkle and beauty.

If you are shopping for a fancy cut diamond and are interested
what specifications define the top cut class for that shape,
give us a call and we will be happy to discuss this with you.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Beauty meets the bulletproof vest in a gown designed for Miss
Israel to wear at the Miss Universe pageant next month.  The
top of the silk dress, embroidered with diamonds and pearls,
is covered by an army-issue flak jacket adorned with diamonds
for a so-called softer look, the Associated Press reported.

The dress sends a message that everyday life should go on
despite renewed violence, its designer said.  ``I want people
in Israel to continue to go out,'' said Galit Levi, a Tel Aviv
fashion designer. ``But be careful.''

Levi also designed two prior Miss Universe dresses. In 1998,
her design featured the faces of Yitzhak Rabin, Yasser Arafat
and Bill Clinton, leaders known for Middle East peace efforts.
In 1999, the first Arab Miss Israel, Rana Raslan, wore a dress
with a large red Star of David, an Israeli symbol.

Ilanit Levy, an 18-year-old soldier from Haifa, will wear the
bulletproof dress in the Miss Universe competition May 11 in
Puerto Rico


$500 MILLION HEIST FOILED IN LONDON
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Would-be thieves crashed a bulldozer into London's Millennium
Dome on Nov. 7, hoping to snatch $500 million worth of
diamonds=01*including the spectacular 203-ct. De Beers Millennium
Star. The robbers planned to make their getaway in a speedboat
waiting on the Thames River. It would have been the world's
largest robbery, but the diamonds were already gone from
their tented exhibition arena, and Scotland Yard was waiting.
Officers disguised as cleaners overpowered the robbers, and a
dozen men were arrested without a shot fired.

Tipped off by police, dome officials had replaced the gems
with crystal fakes. De Beers officials say the pear-shaped
Millennium Star is arguably the most perfect large diamond in
the world.

Four men were arrested after trapping themselves in the vault
that usually houses the diamonds. Police picked up another
near a speedboat on the river, and a sixth man on the opposite
shore. Six others were apprehended later in southeastern
England.

Representatives of the New Millennium Experience Co., which
operates the dome, said the diamonds are displayed in an
exhibition area of the facility called the "money zone" and
are closely guarded. The Millennium Star is displayed in a
reinforced glass cylinder, and the area has alarms and
security cameras. The collection also features 11 large
diamonds of a distinctive vivid blue color.

Police said the robbers, apparently disguised as workmen,
crashed through a perimeter fence and drove the bulldozer
past security guards at around 9:30 a.m., shortly after the
attraction opened for the day. As they entered the building,
they donned gas masks before unleashing smoke bombs.
Fortunately, none of the estimated 100 visitors in the tent
were nearby.

Disguised police were positioned around the inside of the
dome. After the robbers went into the vaults and became
trapped, they were ordered to come out at gunpoint by the
officers. The intruders were captured as they bashed at the
display cases with hammers and sledgehammers.


PLATINUM PRICES HAVE SOARED
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
For the past ten years, platinum prices have fluctuated
between $350-$450 per troy ounce on the commodity markets.
In the second half of 1999 the prices start a climb that
saw prices move from $350 to almost $650 per ounce at the
start of this year.  This increase is mostly due to the
big increase in demand in platinum jewelry while supplies
have not been able to keep up.  Check out the price chart
at http://futures.tradingcharts.com/prairielinks/PL/M
that plots this trend.  Note how there are some weeks
where the price has $100 swings.

The impact on you the consumer is two fold, the prices you
pay today are almost twice what they were a year ago and
the supply of parts for mountings and jewelry can sometimes
take weeks to restock.  The other impact is that if you
bought jewelry with significant platinum content, it is
now worth more and would cost more to replace.  If your
appraisal is more than one year old, you might want to
consider having it reappraised for insurance purposes.


CLARITY GRADING
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Undoubtedly, size is an important factor in determining
the clarity grade.  The more difficult it is to see an
inclusion, particularly face-up, the less it will
influence the clarity grade.

Almost as a part of size, the number of inclusions must
be considered.  Clarity grading does not, however, consist
of merely counting inclusions, but rather judging how
readily that number can be seen.  A stone could, for
example, have a number of minute pinpoints and still be
graded high on the scale.  Usually one or two of the
largest inclusions will establish the grade.  Additional
inclusions, if small or minute, will have little or no
effect on the grade.

The position of an inclusion affects how readily it can be
seen.  Cutters call the area seen through the table the
"heart" of the stone and make every effort to orient rough
stones so that inclusions are not visible through the
table of the finished stone.  The preferred position for
inclusions is under the bezel facets or near the girdle
because they are less noticeable there.

Sometimes inclusions are located where they cause
multiple reflections in the pavilion facets when you look
at the stone in the face-up position.  Such reflectors
lower the clarity grade more than similar non-reflecting
inclusions.

The type of inclusion can sometimes influence the clarity
grade.  Most inclusions do not threaten a diamond's
durability.  Remember, long before a stone ever reaches
the consumer, it has already been subjected to considerable
heat and stress in both the cutting and manufacturing
processes. It is unlikely to get rougher treatment simply
by being worn.  But large cleavages or feathers,
particularly when they reach the table or extend from the
crown through the girdle, are potentially hazardous since
they could be extended by a severe blow.

Most inclusions are white or colorless, but sometimes
they are black, brown, dark red, or green.  These, or
course, are easier to see and lower the clarity grade more
than a colorless inclusion.  However, curiously enough,
a dark inclusion dead center under the table is often
surprisingly inconspicuous.

Most inclusions have little impact on the beauty of the
diamond since they are not visible with the naked eye.
The high price associated with high clarity has more to
do with rarity than beauty.  If most diamonds were flawless,
it is likely that included diamonds would command the
greatest interest and price.


OCTAHEDRON
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D
The octahedron is the most common form of gem quality
diamond crystals.  The octahedron is shaped like two
pyramids, one upside down and fastened at the bases.
Perfectly formed octahedrons, called glassies, are among
the most striking of all mineral crystals.  Rough crystals
with this shape are well suited to be cut into the popular
round and princess shapes.


WHERE DIAMONDS FORM
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Diamonds form only under certain chemical, temperature,
and pressure conditions.  Scientists estimate that the
necessary conditions of temperature and pressure can exist
in parts of the Earth's mantle (inside the crust) between
75 and 120 miles beneath the Earth's surface.

Almost all diamonds are carried to the surface by a specific
type of peridotite rock called kimberlite.  The Australian
diamonds were carried by a similar type of rock called
lamproite.  For billions of years, kimberlites have
periodically carried diamonds to the Earth's surface.

We call diamond deposits in kimberlite pipes primary
deposits.  The kimberlite itself is not very tough so it
breaks down with sunlight, heat and cold, wind and rain, and
other environmental forces.  The diamonds often get washed
out of the pipe and into the beds of rivers where they
gather in potholes and eddies. These are called alluvial
deposits.  If the river currents are strong enough, they
may carry their diamonds all the way to the sea.  There
the stones either settle to the bottom or are washed back
onto the beach.  These diamond rich areas are called
marine deposits.  Diamonds found in alluvial and marine
deposits and in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks are said
to be from secondary deposits.

Bill

Attached is the letter and analysis spreadsheet sent to Rod Boschee today. 
The letter outlines the additional interim steps identified at this weeks 
meeting. The letter also contains reference to a spike in the analysis 
results at Transwesterns Measuring Station filter separator. The split sample 
came back at this site at 216/185 PPM. We are making arrangements to have the 
sample rerun at another lab. All other analysis points remained consistent 
with last week. Lou Soldano advised me that since the spike occurred on our 
equipment, that it may not be worthy of my personal phone call to Rod.

Lou Soldano has also prepared a draft of a letter for you to send to Mr 
Mazotti regarding our on going concern and additional plans. He has, or will 
be sending that to you directly.

If you have any questions, please call.

Mike

The third quarter PCB meeting with Southern California Gas Company was held 
this morning.  SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management 
and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for $120,602.19 
(86%).  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating expenses 
for PCB activities in California.  On a similar note, while speaking to Ralph 
Komai, PCB person for SoCal, some interesting things are happening on their 
system and are presented below:

SoCal is beginning to notice accumulations of PCB pipeline liquids on 
portions of their system which has been considered PCB clean.  It is these 
portions of their pipeline for which they have been petitioning EPA to 
declassify.  These liquids are not new liquids introductions into the SoCal 
system but historic liquids that have laid in their pipeline. Because of the 
fact that Transwestern is not seeing liquids accumulations at the compressor 
stations upstream of Needles, we know that liquids are not being sent inot 
California.  Due to the increase of Transwestern gas into the SoCal system, 
it appears  the gas is sweeping old historic liquids into these new pipeline 
areas.    

SoCal will be meeting with PG&E within the next couple of weeks to discuss 
the discovery of pipeline liquids at an interconnect where SoCal provides 
natural gas to PG&E.The PCB concentrations are less than 5 ppm.  The location 
of this  interconnect is near Bakersfield, Ca.

Southwest Gas has requested that 2 filter separators be installed at 2 
interconnects where they receive gas from SoCal.  As you know, Transwetern 
supplies gas to SoCal who then provides gas to Southwest.   The price of the 
2 separators will be approx. $33,000 plus installation charges.  Ralph stated 
that theses charges will show up on the first or second quarter of 2002.  Of 
note, Southwest has asked SoCal to install each separator on the SoCal side 
of the interconnect which means that maintenance and operation of each 
separator will be SoCal's responsiblility.  these charges will be passed on 
to Transwestern at 86%.

"Roy J. Shanker" <royjshanker@worldnet.att.net> writes to the 
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Chuck, please see that this gets on the appropriate distributions lists, TIE
and BIC.

In thinking over the discussions at the BIC meeting I found two areas
related to interactions with PJM where I am a bit confused due to what is
either my misunderstanding, or conflicting information provided by NY and
PJM. I would appreciate it if the NYISO would clarify these items. I will
also make a similar request of PJM.

1) Common interface tool.

My understand from the PJM EMC meeting was that PJM was going basically do
this entirely (or almost entirely) on their own, and just allocate some
costs between NY and PJM. The product as I understood it would be available
to participants of both pools for transactions scheduling. The users would
input to the tool, and NY and PJM would basically get screened/coordinated
input simultaneously in order to accelerate scheduling and minimize checkout
problems etc.

If this was the case, I don't understand the comments at the BIC that NY
wont be able to do this by the summer. Is this a PJM or NY constraint? Is
PJM unable to complete what they offered? I can understand that that would
hold things up as they proposed to do most of the work. However at the PJM
EMC I got the impression that PJM was all set to go, could make the
schedule, and just needed NY agreement. If this is a NY constraint I would
also like to know more about it.

Can you please clarify what is going on here?

2) Inter ISO Congestion Pilot. I was disappointed in the "lukewarm"
presentation that Rick Gonzales made at the BIC. I realize that this program
is very limited in scope, but it seems to me this is a very important
precedent to the future coordination of the ISO's. As we left things it
seems likely that this will die in committee before the summer.

However, I would like a technical explanation of one of things that Rick
said. He commented that one of his discomforts related to a request by PJM
that NY pay for some generation in Northern New Jersey. At first blush this
got a very negative response in the group.

Then I started to think about this more. My understanding is the basic
structure of the agreement is that ISO A only makes payments to ISO B if B
is taking an action such as re-dispatch to ease a constraint in A.  Thus if
PJM was suggesting NY pay for North Jersey generation, presumably this was
to be for PJM adding generation there to ease a NY constraint. Now I am not
a great electrical engineer, but my limited understanding of the systems
suggests to me that if PJM is adding generation in North Jersey to help NY,
this has to do with modification to the PAR flows and support of SENY
through the PSEG cable. Is this correct?

IF CORRECT, DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE NYISO HAS REJECTED A PROPOSAL TO
INCREASE SUPPLIES TO SENY FOR THIS SUMMER BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR
REDISPATCH IN PJM?

I hope that this is an incorrect conclusion, otherwise we have some big
problems.

I would appreciate a further explanation of this, as perhaps I don't
understand what is physically happening.

Thanks for the help

 Bill, presented below is a summary of the Midland EOTT tank compliance=20
status verified by fax and telephone with the teams.  This information is 9=
8%=20
complete until actual onsite verification occurs, which is set up for the=
=20
month of August. I plan on visiting each team and tank in the Midland=20
Region.  However, until the site visits are completed, this should give you=
 a=20
good idea of the status of the EOTT pipeline tanks stand with respect to ai=
r=20
compliance. =20

1. Tank compliance database, general.  The database, which included 366 tan=
ks=20
at the onset, has been reduced to 106 EOTT P/L tanks.  Tanks operated by EO=
TT=20
Trucking; non-EOTT tanks;  tanks sold, removed, duplicated, or otherwise=20
listed in error, were removed (and saved in another file).  Of the 106 tank=
s=20
listed, 80 are active, 12 are inactive, 10 are permanently out-of-service,=
=20
and 4 are abandoned in place.

=20
2. Permit issues.=20
Federal

a. Title V permit concerns do not appear to be a problem.  Electric pumps a=
re=20
the norm  at EOTT tank farms, so site emissions are exclusively from the=20
tanks and do not exceed 100 TPY.  (Only Crane Station has a Title V permit)=
. =20
This statement is based on =01&worst case=018 calculations using EPA TANKS =
4.0=20
which indicated that in a:

5,000 bbl fixed roof tank:  3.6 MM bbls of RVP 5 crude throughput  (i.e., 7=
20=20
turnovers) produced annual emissions of 48 tons (2 tpy breathing loss, 46 t=
py=20
working loss).=20

55,000 bbl EFR tank:  14.0 MM bbls of RVP 5 crude throughput  (i.e., 255=20
turnovers) produced annual emissions of 9 tons (6 tpy breathing loss, 3 tpy=
=20
working loss).=20

55,000 bbl fixed roof tank:  14.0 MM bbls of RVP 5 crude throughput  (i.e.,=
=20
255 turnovers) produced annual emissions of 4 tons (1 tpy breathing loss, 3=
=20
tpy working loss).=20


State=20

b. State permit concerns do not appear to be a problem.  Sixty-three (63) o=
f=20
the 106 tanks were constructed before 1971 (and not modified or=20
reconstructed). These tanks are grandfathered and require no permit as long=
=20
as throughputs do not significantly change. =20

All of the EOTT Texas tanks of any size constructed/modified/reconstructed=
=20
after 1971 and equipped with a floating roof are exempt under Standard=20
Exemption 86, currently known as Permit-by-Rule 106.478.   None of the tank=
s=20
store material with a true vapor pressure above 11.0 psia, and total actual=
=20
VOC emissions authorized under exemption from any site does not exceed the =
30=20
TAC 106.4 limit of 25 tpy.   No registration for the exemption is necessary=
,=20
since the tanks are not located in a nonattainment county for ozone.

New Mexico=01,s permitting program for petroleum storage tanks is being=20
developed but,  currently, there are no requirements. Therefore, all EOTT=
=20
tanks in New Mexico meet state permit requirements.  However, when finalize=
d,=20
the control requirements for tanks in New Mexico will not be more stringent=
=20
than the federal NSPS Subpart Kb.  Therefore, a tank equipped with a floati=
ng=20
roof would be authorized to store petroleum product with a true vapor=20
pressure up to 11.0 psia.   Only the four fixed roof tanks at Maljamar and=
=20
the one at Loco Hills could be affected.=20

4. Recordkeeping and inspection issues.  The grandfathered tanks have no=20
requirements. For tanks subject to NSPS Subpart K, only capacity data is=20
required.  Tanks subject to Ka and Kb require inspection, repairs if=20
warranted, and recordkeeping. =20

Note: Especially for some of the older tanks, neither a manufacturer=01,s=
=20
identification plate or=20
strapping table is available.  I would suggest that we pursue a records=20
search of old EOTT files to verify construction dates.  I dont know where t=
o=20
start on this.

5. Specific compliance/requirements summary.  The tabled information=20
identifies the following:

Federal
- 2 tanks (McElroy 58005, Loco Hills 4602) may not be meeting NSPS control=
=20
requirements
- 4 tanks (Maljamar 1519-1522)  may not be meeting NSPS control requirement=
s

(All are cone tanks,  subject to Ka/Kb.  Based on a capacity > 472 bbls and=

The Enron stock price has been pretty cruel.
I hope you and the others did not get hurt to bad.
If I had not left I would have been there with you
guys from now on.
How is Butch doing?
I have not had a report on him in some time.
Keep your chin up and do make contact from time to
time.

I will get a name from Randy and see if we can set something up for next
week. I believe the contact is Dr. Jeffrey Single, with all the changes
it's a good idea for us and Scott Jones to set down with them so they know
who we are. I don't feel they have lack of confidence in us but all the
contact with them is through our consultant. To get this project started we
might  have to purchase the compensation credits through Area or face more
delays. The approval from the Fish and Wildlife Service stated that the
Kern Water Bank would need a letter from CLEP that we had purchased
compensation credits. I contacted them today to see if we could post a
letter of credit instead but they had not received the approval letter from
the Fish and Game. Cheryl Harding at KWB was surprised that we had to
provide this information to her.

I will set something up as and let you know as soon as possible.

Kenny, I think its time we met the Fish and Game and smoothed this issue
out.  Do you feel comfortable going to them or would you like me to go with
you?  I think under the circumstances, we both should meet with the Game
and Fish and make sure that they have a level of confidence in EOTT and
this project.  Due to  Randi's involvement, why dont you get a contact from
her and lets discuss an appropriate time next week (Tuesday or Wednesday)
to meet the F&G?  There are some other issues we need to discuss with them
in addition to this conservation credit acreage and we can make the most
out  of the trip.

Subject:  Re: Rogas Line -- USFW Approval



I obtained a copy of a letter sent to Gary Fuller from the Department of
Fish and Game on November 3, 2000. In the letter the Fish and Game agreed
EOTT has 41 Acres of conservation credits based on Arco Western Energy's
sale of the North Coles Levee fractionator plant and premises to Koch Oil
and Gas, and Koch's subsequent sale of the plant and premises to EOTT
ENERGY.

In the letter the following limitations and clarifications were listed:

Because the conservation credits may be used for mitigation of EOTT
impacts, or sold by EOTT to third parties for their own mitigation needs,
EOTT must affirm that it will conform to the Department's  standards for
sale of conservation credits as well as management of the credit lands.

These obligations are already implied by the chain of Koch's and then
EOTT's acquisitions  of the North Coles Levee fractionator plant. EOTT and
Department representatives will need to meet to discuss these details and
determine the most efficient means to implement these conditions.

Key provision of the obligations that attend using the conservation credits
include Department approval of third-party sales;  minimum endowment
requirements for all credit sales; management and monitoring of habitat
conditions; and additional mitigation for disturbance to dedicated habitat.

Habitat continuity and small animal movement between the North Coles
fractionator plant site and the remainder of Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve
must be provided in order to maintain viability of the habitat within
EOTT's holdings.

 Although it appears we do have the credits for NCL, I do not know if Gary
ever met with the Fish and Game to discuss the details or means to
implement the conditions for use of the conservation credits. With the
project set to start we may have to purchase the 15.3 acres of credit from
Area.

Kenny and Scott,

I agree with Ed's note concerning the need to move expeditiously in the
purchase of compensation acreage noted by the US Fish and Wildlife Service
(Service) in there approval letter.  This in indeed "good news" and EOTT
must move ahead to fulfill its obligation as per the MOU and Incidental
Take Permit.  By copy of this email, I am asking Larry Campbell to work
with both of you to assist in the proper fulfillment of EOTT's obligation
as promptly as possible.

It is also my understanding, from what research I have been able to do,
that EOTT does have approximately 14 to 15 acres of credit at the North
Coles Levee Preserve.  You should verify the exact credit number and
furnish the Service with such verification.  That is acreage EOTT will not
have to purchase in satisfying the obligation of the permit.

Keep me posted as you move forward on this issue.  John Shafer

Subject:  Rogas Line -- USFW Approval


     Randi McCormick just forwarded to me a letter addressed to EOTT, dated
February 14, 2001  from the US Fish and Wildlife Service approving our
project "for participation in the Kern Water Bank Compensation Bank," and
authorizing the Water Bank "to extend their incidental take authority to
you and your entire project under their Master Permit."  This is, of
course, very good news.

     The letter notes, however, that we still need to purchase compensation
acreage both at North Coles Levee and at the Kern Water Bank.
Specifically, we must do the following:  (1) contact Cheryl Harding of Kern
Water Bank to acquire 23.1 acres of compensation credits, and to get
included in their Master Permit; and (2) get Cheryl Harding a letter from
the Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve (Mark Poe of Aera) stating that we have
purchased 15.3 acres of credits for North Coles Levee, or that we have set
aside that amount from credits we have in the past purchased.

     While I could make these contacts, I do not believe that would be wise
because -- as Kenny can attest -- our past experience has been that
whenever a lawyer contacts the Water Bank, it prompts them to automatically
get their lawyers involved.  And our experience has been that this only
slows things down -- or worse.

     My suggestion therefore is that one or both of you gentlemen contact
Cheryl as soon as practical and ask her for (1) proposed contract for
acquisition of 23.1 acres of compensation credits and (2) perperwork to
include EOTT (and its contractors) in their Master Permit.  She should also
be informed that, while we have not yet purchased the 15.3 acres of NCL
credits, we will by the end of this week have a letter of credit posted as
security, as allowed under our State Take Permit, to cover this amount of
acreage.  Ask whether a copy of this LC will suffice for her purposes, or
whether we will need to have the actual acreage purchased.

     As this would remove a major impediment to construction of the new
lines, it is important that we move on this will all deliberate speed.
Please call me if you have any questions, or if you would like otherwise to

Revised listing, assumes SIC 4612 only.
For rationale for not classifying as 5171, please see Memo, para. 2.

Currently, I'm collecting required info so that the TNRCC Region can assign
an account numbers for the 12 tank sites that need them.

I received the API 653 yesterday and inserted the addendum pages.
It's an excellent reference, but doesn't focus on compliance/environmental
aspects. You only need general familiarity,
so reading Section 4 and Appendix C In-service is plenty right now.

In your spare time (ha,ha) try to look over the 2 page "In-Service" tank
inspection checklist I sent you and see if it makes sense. For about 8 years
I've used this 50 item checklist, combined with the IFR/EFR inspection
report and a seal gap measurement sketch.  In my opinion, it's all you need
right now.

Next week, I'll put the site questionnaire together.
Any questions for me... Bill Glushko 281 953-1014

Larry,

I spoke with Darron Blackburn regarding the Burger, Crane, and Sonora
accounts.  Darron has told me that the blue fee return sheets indicate that
EOTT submitted zero fees for these three accounts.  Darron indicated that
these sites had either NSPS sources or an active Title V permit.  Therefore,
fees would be required.  A fee would not be required if there was no
intention of operating the sites in the 2002 fiscal year (September 1, 2001
through August 31, 2002).

1. If a fee is owed but the site did not operate in 2000, then EOTT would
owe the minimum fee - $26.
2. If the Title V was not officially terminated prior to Nov.1, then the fee
is required if the source operates in the fiscal year.

Our database shows Burger and Sonora to be out of service.  Therefore, a
2002 fiscal year fee would not be required.  This needs to be communicated
to Mr. Blackburn in writing.  Our database shows Crane to have all
grandfathered tanks.  Therefore, the only trigger for a fee would be an
active Title V permit.  Do you know if the TNRCC has voided the Title V and
if so when?

 Randi McCormick just forwarded to me a letter addressed to EOTT, dated 
February 14, 2001  from the US Fish and Wildlife Service approving our 
project "for participation in the Kern Water Bank Compensation Bank," and 
authorizing the Water Bank "to extend their incidental take authority to you 
and your entire project under their Master Permit."  This is, of course, very 
good news.

 The letter notes, however, that we still need to purchase compensation 
acreage both at North Coles Levee and at the Kern Water Bank.  Specifically, 
we must do the following:  (1) contact Cheryl Harding of Kern Water Bank to 
acquire 23.1 acres of compensation credits, and to get included in their 
Master Permit; and (2) get Cheryl Harding a letter from the Coles Levee 
Ecosystem Preserve (Mark Poe of Aera) stating that we have purchased 15.3 
acres of credits for North Coles Levee, or that we have set aside that amount 
from credits we have in the past purchased.

 While I could make these contacts, I do not believe that would be wise 
because -- as Kenny can attest -- our past experience has been that whenever 
a lawyer contacts the Water Bank, it prompts them to automatically get their 
lawyers involved.  And our experience has been that this only slows things 
down -- or worse.

 My suggestion therefore is that one or both of you gentlemen contact Cheryl 
as soon as practical and ask her for (1) proposed contract for acquisition of 
23.1 acres of compensation credits and (2) perperwork to include EOTT (and 
its contractors) in their Master Permit.  She should also be informed that, 
while we have not yet purchased the 15.3 acres of NCL credits, we will by the 
end of this week have a letter of credit posted as security, as allowed under 
our State Take Permit, to cover this amount of acreage.  Ask whether a copy 
of this LC will suffice for her purposes, or whether we will need to have the 
actual acreage purchased.

 As this would remove a major impediment to construction of the new lines, it 
is important that we move on this will all deliberate speed.  Please call me 
if you have any questions, or if you would like otherwise to discuss how to 
approach this issue.  Thanks a lot.

Vince - 

I certainly appreciate the opportunity to have our group attend
a session given by Enron Research.  While afternoons are typically
the best time to meet, we do have a trader's meeting each Mon & Wed
at 3:30.  If we can accomodate this regular meeting either by scheduling
an earlier meeting on Monday or going for Tue/Thurs, that would be 
great.  Otherwise we can go ahead with the Mon @ 3:30 with an audience
that might be a bit smaller.

Thanks again

George

A meeting was held in Laughlin, Nv with PG&E to discuss the liquids which 
were received and analytical result of 505 ppm which occurred at the PG&E 
F/S.  Additional discussions centered around the latest migration of PCB's 
into the PG&E system and control technologies to stop additional migration of 
PCB's into PCB free portions of their distribution system.

Annual emission fees were paid to the ADEQ for C/S No. 1, Kingman in the 
amount of  $31,145.26

Annual hazardous waste fees were paid to the DTSC for the facilities that 
operate in the state California

A  meeting was held in Albuquerque to discuss and apprise involved parties of 
histoirc and proposed activities for 2000 for the 10 groundwater remediation 
projects currently being conducted in Texas and New Mexico.

Received a call from the TNRCC about an air quality inspection at the Irion 
Co. No. 1 C/S on 6/30.  the team was notified and preparations are currently 
being completed to ensure that all recordkeeping, permits and monitoring 
reports are onsite during the inspection.

This is just a short update on the conference call just completed with 
Michael Adewumi of Penn State, concerning the PCB pipeline modeling project 
proposed for the Transwestern mainline system.  David Roensch, Dr. Adewumi 
and myself discussed the latest proposal submitted by Adewumi and based upon 
his answers to the technical and operational questions, it appears that the 
model will yeild some useful information.  Adewumi was asked about the 
simultaneous modeling of PCB's and arsenic and feels that the model can 
address this situation.  He felt that by initiating the model to the pipeline 
segement  selected for the study (between C/S 4 and C/S3) this information 
could be projected to the other pipeline segments with physical and 
elevational conditions not represented in the segment selected.  As is the 
case with most projects of this nature, answers to some questions cannot be 
addressed until we begin the process. 

It appears that the next step in this process is to have Mike Terraso contact 
Michael Adewumi.  David Roensch and I will be available to feed technical and 
operational information to Adewumi for his modeling input.  It may also be in 
the best interest of this project  to see a team of technical and operational 
experts from Enron and Transwestern begin a  brain stroming of this project 
during the data input stage to address issues related to the field cleaning 
trials, both of the pipeline system and the C/S piping.  By working through 
the process, we may be able to alleviate some potential concerns  and 
increase the cleaning success.  Although Transwestern has been involved in 
this type of cleaning for a number of years, based upon the liquids data 
results, the system has met with variable success.  The more technical and 
operational information we can incorporate into the model, the better will be 
the modeling conclusions and results of the  cleaning activity.

I received a call from Bill Olson (NMOCD) this morning regarding remediation 
activities at the Roswell Station. Bill said that Dave Cobrain with the NMED 
HRMB made a visit to the OCD's office yesterday to get an update on 
activities at the site. Bill said that he provided Mr. Cobrain with copies of 
assessment reports for the site. The last report submitted to the OCD was the 
"Phase IV Assessment Report, Ground Water Monitoring Report, & Phase V Ground 
Water Assessment Work Plan" dated June 30, 1999. The Phase V work plan was 
subsequently approved by the OCD in a letter dated August 19, 1999. The 
assessment activities had been on hold pending a resolution of off-site 
access issues. More recently, we obtained an amendment to the existing water 
development easement so that we could complete the Phase V assessment 
activities. This work is scheduled to be complete within the next 4-6 weeks. 
In a letter to the OCD dated August 29, 2000, we indicated that a report of 
ongoing groundwater monitoring activities and a Phase V assessment report 
would be submitted to the OCD office by December 31, 2000. This was the last 
written correspondence between the OCD and TW.

Bill also indicated that he has worked with Dave Cobrain before. Bill had 
several positive and encouraging comments about Dave and about his discussion 
with Dave, including comments from Dave to the effect that media should not 
be assumed to contain listed wastes and that TW should proceed with 
remediation with oversight by the OCD. Bill said that he informed Dave of 
certain outstanding issues that have impeded progress with remediation at 
this site. Bill also indicated to me that he was encouraged by Dave's 
involvement and with other individuals now on staff at the NMED HRMB.

Randy, based upon the records review, this is the only issue that may be a=

problem.  If a tank has been moved to another location, it would trigger=20
requirements which were enacted on the date of the relocation.  For instanc=
e,=20
if a tank constructed prior to 1973 was moved in 1978, there would be=20
emissions control requirements placed on the tank as required by the 1978=

tank regulations.  If the tank had remained at its original location, it=20
would be grandfathered with respect to emissions.  However, because the tan=

I am sending this notification to your department to seek a solution of 
halting and stopping inappropriate e mail materials which I am receiving.  I 
have been requested by Louis Soldano, Enron attorney for the Gas Pipeline 
Group, to apprise you of this situation.  The content of materials received, 
I consider offensive, and am sure it would also be considered objectionable 
and innappropriate by the standards of Enron Corporation.   Please be 
advised, that many times it is  difficult to screen this material based upon 
the headings and titles that accompany the contents.  Consequently, 
innappropriate materials such as this are opened.  I have accidently opened 
two such e mails by mistake and have received the "Enron warning"  that my 
name and mailbox will be or may be audited in the future and that my name has 
been placed in a file.    Because of this, I am extremely uncomfortable about 
future accidents occuring and more importantly, about the increased frequency 
and accessability of my e mail box to trash and questionable materials.     

I would appreciate your immediate attention in this matter.  Thank you very 
much.

Discussion List:

How do you get from an initial estimate of "75% and 92% of the summer peak
load ... for NYC and LI, respectively" to "having an ICAP requirement for
summer and winter seasons based on the LSE's peak load for the respective
season would send the proper ICAP price signal."   The summer and winter
ICAP requirements are based upon the summer peak load.  Basing the winter
ICAP requirement on the winter peak load would be a substantial change in
the ICAP market.  If we are going to consider a change in this direction
then we also have to apply most of the annual deficiency rate to the summer
period.

most if not all of the contribution to loss of load risk occurs in the
summer months.  As such, some reduction in winter ICAP requirements should
be possible with no impact on the Loss of Load criterion of one day in ten
years.

NYPA requested that the ISO start with the database that resulted in the
locational requirements of 80% and 98% for New York City and Long Island,
respectively.   At NYPA's request the ISO modeled winter ratings on the
transmission interfaces into NYC and LI and determined how much the 80% and
98% could be reduced in the winter before any impact on the statewide Loss
Of Load  occurred.  The report indicates that winter requirements of 75% and
92% of the summer peak load resulted for NYC and LI, respectively.

While this in no way reflects an exhaustive analysis of winter locational
requirements, the results from this study suggest that some reduction in the
winter  requirement may be warranted and a consideration of seasonal
requirements should be incorporated in future ICAP requirement studies.
NYPA believes that having an ICAP requirement for summer and winter seasons
based on the LSE's peak load for the respective season would send the proper
ICAP price signal.


NYPA is sharing the study results in the attached report in an effort to
begin a dialog which we hope will lead to a broader examination of
locational requirements when the issue is revisited again next year.  We
would appreciate hearing the views of other market participants.

Alert Posted: 2:15  PM November 18, 2000  RE- (REVISED) Demand Mismatch Order 
Notice
Effective Monday, November 20, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., and until further notice, 
AGLC is issuing a demand mismatch order for the following primary pools. This 
notice is revised to include the Ex- Atlanta Southern Group
ATLANTA, EX-ATLANTA SNG,  MACON, AUGUSTA , and ROME
Based on the current supply levels and expected demand levels, AGLC's system 
cannot manage the potential excess demand and the operational integrity of 
the system will be threatened. Therefore, it is essential that your 
interruptible customer's demand does not exceed the scheduled supply for your 
interruptible market for each primary pool under the demand mismatch order.
Each shipper/pooler/marketer is responsible for contacting their 
interruptible customers to curtail demand if necessary to meet this order. 
Marketers/Poolers are responsible for maintaining interruptible customer 
contact information. Any customer contact information in GOS is for AGLC 
internal use and is not intended to be marketers/poolers point of contact for 
curtailments.

Mr. Campbell,

Here is the Flagstaff review.  There seems to be some confusion with the
ADEQ regarding the generator engines.  There is no need to accept a 7800

There are two different sizes of filters at Topock

1.  At PG&E there is one 54 inch ID X 17'-6" Horizontal filter separator.  
This separator has 74 elements to it.  They are 4 1/2" OD by 72" long.

2.  At the Selexol plant there are two 48" IDX17"-6" Horizontal filter 
separators.  These separators have 52 elements to each.  They are the same 
size filter as above.

I will be sending a copy of the purchase orders these have all the 
dimensions.  One of these sheet show that the filter elements are 76" long 
this is incorrect.  They are 72" long.

We will talk to you later.  We will be on our way to Kingman in the morning.

Larry, 

Drafts of the 1999 and 2000 annual reports for your CESA MOU are attached 
for  
your use (Wordperfect). There are two outstanding issues regarding the 1999  
report. After speaking with Ed Attanasio, it appears that the Letter of  
Credit issued in 1999 may have expired in 2000 without habitat being  
purchased. This letter of credit either needs to be reestablished or habitat  
needs to be purchased to offset these disturbances. In addition, I do not  
have a copy of evidence that the Coles Levee credits were purchased (for the  
one Coles Levee project in 1999). 

Regarding habitat compensation: 1) Credits can be purchased from Coles 
Levee.  
They must be purchased at Coles Levee for projects on the preserve. For  
outside projects, CDFG and USFWS must approve purchase of these credits on  
case-by-case. 2) Credits can be purchased from Kern Water Bank. Again, USFWS  
and CDFG must concur that credits at Kern Water Bank are appropriate  
compensation for projects on a case-by-case basis. 

Your other source of credits is tied to the land around the NCL gas plant.  
However, as you may have seen by the letter from CDFG that I faxed, EOTT  
still has some negotiating to do with CDFG to put this option in place. Gary  
and I met with CDFG in December regarding this issue. They would like some  
kind of MOU between the parties. At the time, Gary did not think that the 
MOU  
could be completed and signed before Rogas was to begin and decided to work  
on the MOU to cover subsequent projects. 

May I suggest purchasing the needed compensation credits at the same time as  
the Rogas credits are purchased. With Kern Water Bank, there is a $5000 
admin  
fee each time credits are purchased. I don't know what the current charge is  
a Coles Levee. 

Please call me if you have any questions.

Larry-
Two files are attached. The first file includes a project scope and cost 
estimate for 2001. The second file contains two photos of the SVE system that 
was recently started-up. 

The cost estimate is $130,000. This figure includes only contract 
installation dollars, so the work order amount would be about 20-30% more 
than this. The bulk of this figure ($75,000) is for installation of 14 
additional remediation wells. I think we should keep-up an aggressive 
schedule with this site due to the close proximity of the Crane County water 
wells.

Give me a call and lets discuss.

-George

With all that has been going through about the price change for the
16th, I have one question that I would like to have clarified for
future reference.  Suppose that I had bid to export power from NYISO to
PJM and put in a sink price cap of -900.00.  Suppose that then I got
accepted as the price cleared at less than -900.00.  The power was then
scheduled with NYISO and subsequently scheduled with PJM, creating
financial obligations on both ends.  What would happen to the economics
of this schedule in this case?

Mark, Thanks very much for your observations in response to my environmenta=
l =20
memo. I think I understand some of your concerns about the role of the ISO=
=20
in  general and, in particular, with regard to conservation programs. There=
=20
are  several ways in which I think the NYISO is inextricably involved with=
=20
energy  efficiency:=20

The current competitive market the NYISO is overseeing is quite simply not =
=20
working when it comes to demand or load responding to prices. Supply or =20
generators are responding to price=01*imperfectly, but there is significant=
 =20
response. So we have "half a market." We should be seeking to put demand on=
=20
a  par with supply=01*treating load equally with generation. We are moving =
in=20
the  direction of facilitating that, but with basically all consumers on fl=
at=20
or  average rates, and with almost all LSEs (the regulated distribution=20
companies)  able to pass along their energy costs, there is little basis fo=
r=20
responding to  high prices even when we have the software mechanisms in pla=
ce=20
to do so.  Someone needs to find a way to have consumers confronting real=
=20
prices=01*or at  least paying a risk premium for not having to do so. Someo=
ne=20
needs to find a  way to have LSEs have a financial incentive to keep prices=
=20
down=01*they don=01,t  now. One way LSEs could do so would be to encourage =
their=20
(fixed price)  customers, through incentives, to reduce their use when pric=
es=20
are high.  Environmentally, there is a lot at stake in getting the market t=
o=20
work right,  and the ISO plays a major role in that, even when it is not it=
s=20
immediate  responsibility.=20
The emergency measures the ISO is considering have very significant =20
environmental impacts. Small diesel generators may be needed to avoid the =
=20
significant social costs of outages. One environmental concern here is that=
 =20
such generators be restricted to emergency conditions, and not become a new=
 =20
breed of economic peak clippers. And also, it seems reasonable that the =20
emergency program "clean up after itself" by having offsets or mitigation =
=20
associated with it. Actual demand reductions are a preferable alternative =
=20
since they do not have health and environmental impacts=01*and help lower=
=20
market  prices at the same time.=20

I don=01,t mean to suggest that the NYISO is responsible for all of the iss=
ues =20
raised here=01*clearly the PSC, DEC, NYSERDA and others have very important=
=20
roles.  I think the NYISO needs to work with these other agencies to get=20
competition to  work more or less right, and pull down prices and protect t=
he=20
environment at the  same time.=20

Sorry if I have fallen into the trap of repeating myself=01(at length. Than=
ks =20
for your comments.

Larry - I've received a copy of the compliance order.  It assesses a penalty 
of $15,000 per day for each day of violation (May 1996 to September 8, 1997 
or  496 days).  This results in a fine of $7.44 million.  I hope the order 
has a typo and the NMED meant a penalty of "up to" $15,000 per day of 
violation. If this is not a typo I see no downside to asking for a hearing 
and a settlement conference. We may do so anyway.  Since we only have till 
mid-July to file the request for hearing which must include very specific 
admissions or denials and the basis of our affirmative defenses, I'd like 
Larry to flesh out the notes below and pull any relevant documentation 
together.....

Dave - let's discuss counsel for this matter in the morning and I'd like to 
make a call to NMED counsel.  I'd be tempted to bring Braddock in even though 
this is New Mexico...

Lou -- I spoke with Larry the other evening about this and will be more than 
happy to work on it until you resurface. I'm actually out of the office all 
next week while on vacation in Florida but I'll have a computer (email

Subject: Compliance Order, P-1 C/S

Transwestern received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air 
Quality Bureau, for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1 
C/S which occurred in 1996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this 
issue in 1996 and assumed that the issue had been resolved, as no further 
actions were received from the agency until this Compliance Order was 
received. The issue in question was Transwestern's replacement of 
interchangeable internal components from a 4700 turbine into the existing 
smaller turbine (3505).  The larger internal components  (inlet guide 
vanes/nozzles) which were placed into the 3505 were mechanically derated to 
simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.  When Transwestern received 
permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine capacity, 
Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments and then operated at the higher 
turbine value 4700.  The AQB did not understand that Transwestern could not 
make the adjustments to the inlet guide vanes as any such activity by 
Transwestern would void the warranty with Soalr Mfg.  Only Solar is 
authorized to make adjustments to the turbine.  This prevents Transwestern 
from randomly and arbitrarily manipulating and adjusting horsepowers of this 
turbine at their descretion.

In the 1996 meeting with the AQB, Transwestern committed to conducting a 
emissions test of the 4700 to determine if emissions were more or less than 
the permitted values for the 3505.  It was shown that emissions from the 4700 
were less than that permitted by the AQB for the 3505.  It should also be 
mentioned that the 3505 was a regerative turbine and the 4700 is a simple 
cycle.   

  Apparently, EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to 
be outstanding as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the 
Compliance Order to review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern 
has 30 days to request another hearing. 

Id like to have a group discussion to decide how Transwestern will manage and 
handle this issue.  Would someone contact Anabelle and have her set up a 
conference call for sometime next week?

Subject: Removing impediments to electric generation in western states - w 
hat's in it for the pipelines


Attached is a Word  version of the FERC EL01-47 order, Removing Impediments 
to Electic  Generation  in the Western US.  The order  was issued May  16.  
The order:
 
         (1) Temporarily waives  blanket certificate regulations toincrease 
the dollar  limitations for natural gasfacilities under automatic 
authorization to  $10 million 
        and for prior notice authorizations to $30 million for  all pipelines 
that deliver gas in the WSCC http://www.wscc.com/;
        
        (2)  Temporarily waives blanket certificate regulations to allow 
construction of  mainline facilities, including temporary compression and 
facilities  that alter         mainline  capacity;
 
        (3)Allows  pipelines to roll-in costs costs of facilities constructed 
under  waived blanket certificate regulations until April 30,  2002..
 
The FERC did NOT find it  appropriate to provide a greater rate of return for 
pipelines into the western  US.  The FERC stated that the demand in the 
Western US market is an  adequate rate incentive for the short term.  In 
addition, there are other  rate incentives, according to FERC, albeit more of 
a long-term nature, in  esistence and at the disposal of the pipelines that 
deliver gas in the  WSCC.  Pipelines have the right to propose market-based 
or negotiated  rates.  Pipelines can propose incentive rates.  In addition, 
pipelines  can design incremental rates for projects which propose rates of 
return and  depreciaiton rates that differ from those used on a system wide  
basis.
 
The areas of interest to  the pipeline industry are highlighted on pp. 29-38 
of the attached  order.

I spoke at length today with Rod Boschee at PG&E.  The main focus of our 
discussion was logistics/planning for the upcoming 4/13/99 meeting between TW 
and PG&E representatives.  Mr. Boschee, as in earlier conversations this 
week, did not mention the 3/25 sample results.  Rather, it was agreed (also 
mandated by his boss, Bill Mazotti) that the time was ripe for a follow-on 
meeting to our initial discussion in Topock back in January.  I provided 
verbal notification to Mr. Boschee that Transwestern had retained an outside 
contractor for purposes of a decontamination process to be accomplished 
tomorrow at our filter separators.  In addition to my verbal notification, I 
told him that TW would provide PG&E with a letter, just to complete the paper 
trail.  I reinforced the importance of communication between the companies, 
both formal and informal.  A copy of the letter I faxed to Mr. Boschee is 
attached below.


Mr. Boschee will be preparing a draft agenda for the 4/13 meeting for TW to 
consider.  In addition to TW providing an update on all interim as well as 
long term plans for the lateral, Mr. Boschee noted two important items.  
First, PG&E would like more information regarding the proposed controlled 
Selexol flush.  Their concern is that the Selexol was colored initially as 
the culprit in this PCB issue, and now is being considered a part of a 
revised interim solution.  Secondly, PG&E would like to discuss the upcoming 
filter change at its station currently scheduled for 4/29.  

We've decided to meet in Las Vegas on 4/13.  The choice of Vegas seemed to be 
more centralized (vs. San Francisco), as well as more convenient for those of 
us travelling all the way from Houston.  PG&E is planning on having the 
following personnel attend the meeting:
 Rod Boschee-  Director of Contract Development
 Dave Anderson-  Attorney
 Mel Wong-  Project Manager, Topock Lateral project
 Jody Garcia-  District Superintendent, Barstow Dist.
 Tony Estrada-  Environmental
 2 as-yet-to-be-named Barstow team members

Transwestern is planning on having the following personnel attend the meeting:
 Jeff Fawcett- Marketing
 Louis Soldano-  Attorney
 Mike Nelson-  VP Operations
 Rich Jolly-  District Ops
 Larry Campbell-  Environmental
 Bob Iversen-  Technical advisor, Selexol/PCB matters
 Earl Chanley-  Engineering

The plan is to take Bill's plane from Houston, pick-up Mike Nelson in 
Amarillo, meet in Vegas, and return (with drop-off in Amarillo) to Houston in 
one day.  I'm coordinating the logistics with Virginia O'Neill.  My guess at 
this point is that we'll plan on being in Las Vegas by 10:30 a.m., with the 
meeting to begin at 11:00 a.m., a working lunch served at 12:00 noon, and 
adjourn somewhere around 2:00 p.m., with a return flight of 2:30 p.m.

Lou Soldano is in receipt of a few of Bill Cordes' suggestions to the letter 
that Bill will send out to Bill Mazotti that will: (1) outline the revised 
Interim Plan, including the Selexol flush, (2) notify him of our initiative 
to decon TW's filter/separators, and (3) reinforce our desire to meet on 
4/13.  If the logistics (KEYEX meeting) can be worked out, the letter will 
probably go out by Friday.

If you have any questions regarding the matters outlined above, please advise.

Larry Campbell and Mike Riedel,

I have spoken with Lou, Bill and Phil Lowry about this suggestion.  Phil had 
no negative reaction to proceeding in the manner described by this email.  
However, I did get a read from Bill and Lou that certain EOTT bases should be 
touched (first) prior to this change in placement of personnel.  Therefore, I 
am asking Bill (by copy of this email) to work with Lou and come up with a 
list of the names of folks that we should visit with prior to formerly 
getting this process started.  Bottom line: this is a good idea and one that 
we probably will do, however, prior to formerly beginning posting of the job, 
etc. - we need to walk the idea through EOTT first.  Call me if you have 
additional thoughts or questions.  Thanks for bringing this idea up - I like 
it.  John Shafer

Subject: EOTT concerns with Fuller's resignation

I had dinner tonight with a Robert Jacobs EOTT  V.P. West Coast and Ed 
Attanasio EOTT Senior Counsel.  This dinner meeting was put together by Gary 
Fuller.  Both Jacobs and Attansio expressed serious concern about ETS's 
abilty to provide environmental expertise and representation at the EOTT 
Bakersfield facilities due to Gary's departure.  They were concerned because 
of the numerous visits by state regulatory personnel conducting unnounced 
onsite inspections and the fact that EOTT may not have an onsite 
environmental representative.  They were highly complementary of Gary and 
were aware of the good repoire he had established with the agencies and they 
felt they would be losing this repoire and credibility if his position was 
not filled with a person located in Bakersfield.  As a courtesy to our 
customer, I told them I would pass on this information to the powers to be in 
Houston.  

After a review of the environmental records and the compliance load for what 
Gary has responsible for,  Im wondering if we should  fill the Bakersfield 
position, or move that position to Midland and possibly use Gary as a 
"temporary technical contact" for ETS.  As you may or may not know, Gary is 
accepting a position with a bakersfield consulting company which specializes 
in providing operation services for energy companys.  Gary will be in charge 
of the environmental  and safety responsibilities for those companies which 
choose to use their service. 

 I understand that there is some environmental sensitivity in California that 
does, at times go above what is required in other states.  However, getting 
the employees at the Bakersfield location on board with skill base pay will 
alleviate much of the existing workload.  What the employees can't handle or 
issues that are above the skill base pay level requirements, can be handled 
and addressed  by Butch and myself with Gary's occasional assistance.  Having 
Gary as a technical contact living in Bakersfield will satisify EOTT's 
concern of having an environmental expert  available for those times when 
agencies arrive unnounced and  at the same time give EOTT the comfort and 
security that they want by knowing that they will be represented by a person 
of Gary's reputation and character. 

In line with this, there appears to be a larger workload and work area in 
MIdland rather than in Bakersfield.  Remediation activites, permitting and 
compliance will be a full time position with the EOTT, Transwestern and 
Northern faciltiies which comprise the Midland area.  In this area, there are 
approximately 13 field teams to provide technical assistance and training 
for.  I feel this will be a full time job.  I think we should give 
consideration to possible using Gary's expertise on a part time basis in 
Bakersfield and relocate and fill his position in Mildand, Tx.

Mike - I'd suggest we move on any decon work for our facilities at the same 
time.....

The find of PCBs in the compressors will undoubtedly be the subject of next 
week's meeting.  The presence of PCBs does not limit their use at that 
station.  PG&E would be reluctant to move the engines around on the system.  
Depending upon the concentrations at the time, they may be restricted in 
their ability to sell or reuse the compressors.  I'm not aware of any true 
decon process for such equipment.  Vector may be able to propose a piecemeal 
decon project but it would likely be expensive and involve the outage of the 
equipment for a significant period of time.   We might want to gather a group 
of folks and go over the agenda and our pososible response to a request by 
PG&E to take down thier compression.

Subject: Additonal Information Concerning PG&E

On a related note, I spoke to Vector concerning the equipment which was 
suggested for cleaning on the PG&E system.  It is as follows:

 2 scrubbers, some underground C/S piping, filter separator, horizontal tank, 
2-10.84 drip locations

The Vector proposal for mobilization, demobilizataion and cleaning the above 
PG&E equipment will be approx. $ 75, 000.  

I approached Vector about the pipeline cleaning between our M/S and their 
C/S.  They quoted a turn key price of $34,000.  Because this piping belongs 
to Transwestern, we should contract this cleaning ourselves.  If the decision 
is made to address this cleaning, I think we would want to have it done 
during the same time period as the PG&E cleaning activities.  I will also 
need some lead time to notify Vector and determine an appropriate methodology 
to be used.  Vector apparently has an approved methodology for cleaning pipes 
to 36".  

One additional note, apparently PG&E has discovered PCBs in their gas 
compressors.  In wipe samples taken of the internal compressors PCBs were 
found at regulated levels.....

Rick,
Attached is communications I have had with Solar on the Saturn turbine fuel 
consumption.  The fuel rate Ms Leslie Whitherspoon cites in her example below 
is the lowest I have seen from Solar for a Saturn turbine.  I do not know for 
a fact whether her example is applicable to our operation.  

I am making you aware that any of the calculations using Solar's data has 
exceeded the 10.7 gigajoule/hr limit as specified in 40 CFR 60.330 clause of 
the BNA's Subpart GG - Standards of Performance for Stationary Gas Turbines.

I was incorrect to say exceeding this fuel consumption would trigger PSD; per 
our conversation it only triggers a NSPS permit which occordingly is 
triggered anyway with the replacement of a Saturn turbine.  Attached is the 
spreadsheet I forwarded to Ms Whitherspoon.

In the NSPS formula the "STD" value is % by volume....

Therefore, you take your result, 0.015 % ppmv, and move the
decimal two places to the left to represent ppmv.  Result 0.00015
or 150 ppm.

Yes, the Saturn has a heat input high enough to trigger the NSPS
regulation.  This regulation however, has nothing to do with
triggering PSD.  I don't understand the connection you are
making between NSPS, Subpart GG and PSD.  Most states,
including Kansas, have the delegated authority for NSPS.

All that is required by the standard is a performance test within
180 days of start-up and a record of the sulfur and nitrogen
content of the fuel.  In some cases, less testing is required.

Please let me know if this doesn't answer your questions.  I feel
that there may be some disconnect on what your strategy and
how I'm assisting.

Leslie,
Please review your calculations.  I do not think  (14.4  /  14.4  x
0.015)
equals 150ppm.

This issue is not the tolerable limits of emission of the Solar
Saturn.  I feel
this issue relates to a fuel flow limit which governs whether a
Saturn falls
under the 10.7 gigajoule limit prescibe by 40 CFR 60.330 clause
of the BNA's
Subpart GG - Standards of Performance for Stationary Gas
Turbines.  I have
included a spreadsheet to illustrate my point.  From your data a
Solar Saturn
consumes fuel at the rate of 10,864 BTU/HP.hr; my calculations
show that this
rate consumes fuel a rate about .5 gigajoule above BNAs limit,
which may force
us to apply for a PSD permit.

Please take time to review the spreadsheet and my comments,
and if you see
anything that needs correction, please advise.

(See attached file: Solar Saturn limits.xls)

Thanks

Subject:  NSPS Calculation for Saturn 1200





Heat Rate at ISO conditions:  10,864 Btu/Hp-hr

10,864 Btu/Hp-hr  x  1055 J/Btu  /  745.7 w/Hp  /  1000 J/KJ =
15.37 KJ/w-hr

Max denominator is 14.4 per the regulation

14.4  /  14.4  x  0.015   =  150  ppm

The regulatory limit is 150 ppm.  We warranty the Saturn 1500 at
110 ppm.  I would suppose that the 1200 had a similar warranty.

Please let me know if you need anything else.

"Stephen Fernands" <srfernands@cesolution.com> writes to the 
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Mark,
Thank you for your thoughtful response.  I think you raise some valid
points, but I do not think they change the end conclusion.

Fundamental Value of ICAP
The principle of the ICAP market, as in any market, should be to reflect the
value of the underlying product that is being sold to the market.  The
question is whether the product being sold, in this case ICAP, has truly
appreciated more then 400% since the previous ICAP auctions.  Maybe - but I
doubt it.

AMP and Expected Revenue
The premise that changing the existing market mitigation rules to catch rule
breaking on a real time basis instead of a one day lag basis, although
plausible, seems fairly weak.  It presumes that generation owners were
planning on violating the pre-existing screens and counting on the revenue
from those "golden eggs."  Likewise, the link between "expected energy
revenue" and ICAP prices is tenuous at best.  Generators are not limited to
receiving revenue from the spot market and may well choose to sell energy in
the bilateral market.  In either case the goal of the generation owner is to
maximize revenue through all markets.  The ICAP market, if functioning
properly, should reflect the value of the first call on the energy from the
generator by the NYISO and the ability of the NYISO to curtail external
transactions from that generator.  For example two generation owners owned
two plants with the same characteristics. One generation owner did a
relatively "good" job selling a forward energy contract for the 6 month
procurement period while the other owner did a relatively "poor" job selling
a similar contract.  In the ICAP auctions they both should have the same
strategy - maximize the revenue that each of them can receive out of the
ICAP auction.  Any other strategy by either of the plants will lead to
overall lower profits.

Price Cap Load Bidding (I won't comment on if Virtual Bidding were in place
because it isn't going to be)
Price Cap Load Bidding has been available in the past, only know it is
expanded slightly to Zonal Price Cap Load Bidding.  This is not a
significant change to the existing rules and would seem unlikely to account
for either a significant change in the expected energy revenue or the
underlying value of the ICAP product.

"...significant uncertainty to the New York market..."
I would agree that all of the rule changes including the Penalty and Public
Disclosure Proposal  made it difficult for generation owners to properly
evaluate the effects of selling ICAP into a 6 month market.  For this
reason, as well as the other possible reasons listed on my letter, I believe
that mitigating measures should be evaluated.  I am not passing judgment at
this stage, but feel that all parties should know that the prices that were
posted are in the process of being reviewed and that subsequent changes may
be required to some or all of the months.

Next Steps
If the MMU determines that there was economic and/ or physical withholding,
whether due to regulatory uncertainty in surrounding control areas or
internal uncertainty about the exact effects of the AMP, I believe that it
is most appropriate for the MMU to take immediate action and refer it to the
committees for longer term resolution.

In the final phase of developing and determining environmental compliance for 
the EOTT crude oil tanks in the Midland Region, I have planned a one day site 
visit on the following days to visit each team location to finalize the 
spreadsheet for EOTT crude oil tank environmental compliance:

Hobbs team  August 6 8:00 am

Lovington team  August 7 8:00 am

Jal team  August 8 8:00 am

Eunice team  August 9 8:00 am

I would appreciate one member from each team be available at the team office 
on the assigned day and time to discuss tank history and possibly visit each 
tank farm within the teams area of responsibility.  Your patience and 
assistance in finalizing this information will be greatly appreciated.  If a 
conflict arises, give me a call at (505) 625-8022.

According to my fancy ciphering we made $310,037.50 for the month of 
November.  This figure does not include Buck o 5's New York p&l.  We made 
&127508.45 moving power incrementally and $62497.05 in NEPOOL and PJM.  Mitch 
made $120,032.00 in his December position that was closed out in the month of 
November.  Great job by everyone.  

On another note Russell Ballato has been accepted into the new ENRON trading 
program that will start in January.  No further details as of yet.  Everyone 
should congratulate and support his efforts.  Way to go Russell  and remember 
the peasants.  We expect you to check in with us on a daily basis.  We expect 
a monthly happy hour at your expense.

Also with the Holidays coming up and the reorganization it is very important 
that we communicate with the utmost importance.  We are all responsible for 
what happens on this desk.  I will be out of town from the 23rd of December 
until the 1st of January.  I will have my mobile with me 713-859-1713, any 
questions please call.  Once again great job in November and let's take 
December by the horns.

Thanks

Subject: PCB Decontamination of Turbine

Lou - 

Under the PCB Mega rule, self-implementing decontamination of PCBs (i.e., 
cleanup without verification sampling) is only available for PCB containers; 
movable equipment used in storage areas, tools and sampling equipment; non 
porous surfaces contaminated with mineral oil dielectric fluid; and air 
compressor systems.  40 CFR 761.79(c).  EPA has yet to provide written 
guidance on its PCB Mega Rule decontamination regulations.  Based on my 
reading of the regulations, a contaminated turbine must be decontaminated in 
accordance with the measurement-based decontamination methods.

The measurement-based decontamination procedures are not prescriptive.  The 
simply require that the non porous surface be cleaned by a method that 
reduces the surface concentration to less than or equal to 10 micrograms PCBs 
per 100 square centimeters if the equipment is decontaminated for 
unrestricted use or less than 100 micrograms PCBs per 100 square centimeters 
if the material is to be disposed of in an industrial smelter after 
decontamination. 40 CFR 761.79(b).   I assume that the most efficient method 
of "cleaning" a turbine would be to drain the turbine of all free flowing 
liquids and then wipe or soak all surfaces that were exposed to PCBs with or 
in solvent.

If a solvent is used to clean the surfaces, the regulations require that it 
have a solubility of PCBs of 5% or more by weight (other parts of the 
regulations recommend Kerosene, diesel fuel, terpene hydrocarbons and a 
mixture of terpene hydrocarbons and terpene alcohols).  The solvent can 
continued to be used until it reaches a concentration of 50 ppm PCBs.  40 CFR 
761.79(d).

Once the surfaces have been wiped clean with the solvent, verification 
sampling can be done using the standard wipe test at locations on the turbine 
selected under Subpart P (which includes the sampling of small and irregular 
shaped surfaces).  If the measurements show the surfaces have been cleaned to 
< 10 ug/100 cm2, the equipment is available for unrestricted use.  40 CFR 
761.79(b)(3)(1)(i)(A).

Persons participating in the decontamination activities must use protective 
clothing or equipment to protect against dermal contact of inhalation of PCBs 
or materials containing PCBs and take precautions not to release PCBs into 
the environment from the decontamination area.  40 CFR 761.79(e).

Written records of the sampling procedure used to verify that the equipment 
has been decontaminated and sampling results must be maintained for 3 years.  
The regulations do not require that a written record of the procedure used to 
decontaminate the material be generated or maintained.  40 CFR 761.79(f).

Decontamination wastes and residues that are generated by rinsing or soaking 
contaminated surfaces with solvent can be disposed of at their existing 
concentration, which means that hydrocarbon solvents used which contain <50 
ppm PCBs can be marketed as used oil.  40 CFR 761.79(g).

The non-liquid cleaning materials (e.g., rags) and personal protective 
equipment, regardless of concentration, can be disposed of at a municipal 
landfill, a industrial non hazardous waste facility, a RCRA subtitle C 
facility permitted to accept PCBs or a TSCA PCB disposal facility.  40 CFR 
761.79(g)(6).

Finally, notification to the EPA is not required.  Verification sampling 
procedures and analysis must be available for EPA review when requested.  40 
CFR 761.79(f).

A very simple procedure would be:

1.  All persons participating in the decontamination activity must wear 
personal protective equipment that protects from skin exposure that prevents 
inhalation of PCBs. 

2.  Drain turbine of all free flowing liquids.

3.  Wipe all surfaces or parts the would or could have been in contact with 
liquids with rags soaked in clean, unused solvent such as Kerosene.  

4.  Collect all personal protective equipment and rags used during the 
decontamination process in drums for disposal.

5.  Collect all used solvent and appropriate containers (Drums?).  Collect 
sample of solvent and have it tested to determine disposal options.

6.  Sampling cleaned equipment by collecting wipe samples at locations 
determined under Subpart P of the regulations.

7.  If verification samples indicate equipment is contaminated at levels less 
than or equal to 10 ug/100 cm2 PCBs, the equipment is released for 
unrestricted use.  If samples indicate greater levels of PCBs, cleaning as 
described above must be repeated with follow-up verification sampling.

Call me after you have had a chance to look at this.

Sue

The state of Texas conducted an air quality inspection of the NNG Seminole 
C/S.  There were no deficiencies or violations identified at the facilit 
during the inspection.

The State of New Mexico Air Quality Bureau conducted an inspection of the 
Transwestern Atoka No. 3 C/S.  The Agency conducted a record review and did 
portable emissions testing of 3 of the 5 emissions units at the facility.  
Although fuel use and a natural gas analysis were not available for the units 
tested, emissions exceedances for NOx are expected for the 2 White Superiors 
at the facility.  

The State of New Mexico Air Quality Buureau conducted an inspection of the

testing of the two turbines and one recip at the facility.  Although fuel use 
and a natural gas analysis was not available at the facility, all units 
tested  appeared to be in compliance with the permit limits.  The agency

John, I plan on grabbing not only a digital camera but also my video camera 
to handle the panarama part of the equations.  In conversations with Doug 
Cebryk, it looks like the primary routes are Interstate 17 and El Paso's 
existing right of way south.  I spoke with Kevin Hyatt about a possible route 
that exists south to a power plant between station 1 and Kingman Az, and then 
heading southeast into the Phoenix area, but didnt know if the economics 
would work out. Ive got ENSR looking at other routes that might hold 
promise.  I also plan on addressing what might be considered sensitive areas 
of potential impact (streams, rivers, riparian habitat, difficult terrain, 
population and  critical habitat  issues etc)  Ill have a report to you 
shortly after the trip...

Subject: Sun Devil - Helicopter Fly-Over of Routes


	

Larry,

Please give me a report following your fly-over of the route with Doug 
Cebryk.  I am very interested in what you see and the potentials that are 
there.  Don't forget to take your camera.  Pictures (slides) would be most 
helpful as we work through the early planning stages for the greenfield 
portion.  As the primary route begins to solidify with alternates, we will 
need to develop some preliminary maps.  It is my understanding that no maps 
of the route will be released with sign-off from the entire group of: Hyatt, 
Taylor, Veatch and Shafer.

After we receive the "fatal-flaw" desk-top analysis from ENSR (Sept. 21 - 
although I hope to get it sooner), I would offer that several events should 
be scheduled to expedite the project as follows:
1. If the open season reflects that we have a project and Eric Gadd approves, 
a couple of quick meetings will be held with strategic groups to discuss the 
project potential (TNC, State Land Managing agencies, US Forest Service, 
etc).  These strategic groups will be identified by the ENSR fatal-flaw 
analysis.
2. Simultaneously, we will begin working with ENSR (if the open season 
reflects that we have a project) on developing a full scoped Environmental 
Strategy for Sun Devil (this will include an RFP that will immediately go out 
soliciting bids for the Resource Reports and permits). 
3. We will work with Steve Veatch and Joe Hartso to schedule a meeting with 
the FERC Staff (we need the commitment of the State Land Managing Agencies, 
US Forest Service, etc. to collaborate with the FERC on the NEPA review) to 
introduce the project and solicit their commitment to offer staff resources 
early in the process.
4. We will also need to develop a Public Relations and Government Affairs 
strategy which will identify the early meetings that need to be held with 
local, state, federal jurisdictional governing bodies and politicians - so 
the right folks have a heads-up on the project before it hits the news 
media.  This also includes developing a strategy on where and when the 
project will formally be announced (i.e., news conference in Phoenix or 
Houston, etc.).  A $580 Million project will be a big deal in the Phoenix 
area and for the Southwest.

I know there is more, but this will help to keep some of the early events 
coordinated.  John Shafer

Larry,

I am going on vacation for two weeks - my last day will be Oct. 31,
which is a little before the end of the comment period.  I am doing
everything I can to make sure the permits are ready to issue when the
comment period ends.  You have asked about using a sulfur analyzer.
Since that is not typical practice for facilities subject to NSPS GG, I
would have to research that.  Frankly, if you want your permits ASAP,
there really isn't time for that.  Does one of the test methods in
Appendix D of Part 75, which I've pasted below, work for you?  (I know
some don't.)  Please advise so we can keep the process moving.  Thanks.

2.3.3.1.2      Use one of the following methods when using manual
sampling (as applicable to the type of gas combusted) to determine the
sulfur
content of the fuel: ASTM D1072-90, "Standard Test Method for Total
Sulfur in Fuel Gases", ASTM D4468-85 (Reapproved 1989) "Standard
Test Method for Total Sulfur in Gaseous Fuels by Hydrogenolysis and
Radiometric Colorimetry," ASTM D5504-94 "Standard Test Method for
Determination of Sulfur Compounds in Natural Gas and Gaseous Fuels by
Gas Chromatography and Chemiluminescence," or ASTM D3246-81
(Reapproved 1987) "Standard Test Method for Sulfur in Petroleum Gas By
Oxidative Microcoulometry" (incorporated by reference under
o  75.6).

Leon, thanks for the list.  If this is a complete list of the parts which are 
replaced, what parts are "common" between the 3505 and the 4700?  Bill Scott 
is the attorney on this for Enron and I have copied him on this 
correspondence  "wcs@modrallcom."  Plese keep him in the loop on this......

Subject: Common Parts request


Larry,

The hardware that is replaced during overhauls is:
All Bearings (#1,#2,#3)
All seals #1 brg, IGV & variable stators, #2 brg, #3 brg, #1 
nozzle,              #2 nozzle, #3 nozzle
All hardware (nuts, bolts, washers for cases, housings etc.)
All gaskets and packings (air/oil tube, oil drain tubes etc)
All o-rings (oil inlet tubes, etc)

This applies to recoupes and standard engines.  The thing different on the 
recoupe is that some of the hardware for the cases is different and the 
internal blankets are replaced.

If you have any questions or if I can be of further service, please do not 
hesitate to give me a call.

Leon O'Bryan
(801) 352-5100-office
(801) 560-2136-Cell

I received a call from Ralph Komai, PCB engineer with SoCal, about a pipeline 
liquids collection SoCal wants to take at our Needles facility.  Ralph said 
that SoCal will be undertaking a study on their pipeline to determine why the 
concentration and liquids volume of PCB's has reduced into their system in 
the past couple of  years (97-2000). I shared with Ralph and up until this 
year, we have not had liquids at the Needles facility since 1994.  He stated 
that they have seen reduced concentrations and are curious as to why this 
trend is occurring (sounds like good news to me).  He said that their data 
shows the following:

 1998 liquids concentrations  only 1% regulated at the federal level

 1999 liquids concentrations only 8% regulated at the federal level

Ralph has requested that SoCal be allowed to collect a  liquids sample at the 
Needles M/S and I have contacted the Needles team about assisting SoCal with 
the collection.

I would expect that this may have implications with respect to slight 
increased billing for analytical charges that SoCal will be charging us for 
and we reveiw on a quarterly basis with them.

When the corrected generator prices were posted for the 5 May 2001
real-time market, the zonal prices were inadvertently left at their
uncorrected levels.  The updated file for the 5 May 2001 prices posted
today -- 14 May 2001 -- contains the corrected zonal prices as well as the
originally corrected generator prices for 5 May 2001.

Subject: "Megafill"

I contacted John Sailane with Invatech responding to his call to Dr. Terraso.

The material is a polyurethane foam used to fill pipes that are being 
abandoned in place.  He will send me some promotional information.  

Some not-yet-updated information is available on the web at  
http://www.roartech.com/megafill/ claiming that:

Over 1000 lf. of pipe can be filled per day.

 The line will be filled with polyurethane foam to over 50% capacity
 (in most cases 100%).

Meets PCB Mega Rule (TSCA).

Eliminates your need to track retired underground natural gas lines.

No need for the one call system to be used for retired gas lines.

Eliminates the generation of potentially hazardous waste water
created by the rinsing method of abandonment.

No waiting for test results.

No cost for analytical.

Alert Posted: 4:25 PM October 7, 2000: Demand Mismatch Order Notice
Effective Monday, October 9, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., and until further notice, 
AGLC is issuing a demand mismatch order for the following primary pool :
South GA. VAldosta
Therefore, for Monday, October 9, 2000 at 10:00 a.m., Valdosta primary pool
 will be under a Demand Mismatch Order.
Based on the current supply levels and expected demand levels, AGLC's system 
cannot manage the potential excess demand and the operational integrity of 
the system will be threatened. Therefore, it is essential that your 
interruptible customer's demand does not exceed the scheduled supply for your 
interruptible market for each primary pool under the demand mismatch order.
This demand mismatch order carries a potential incentive charge of $30.00/dth 
for under deliveries to AGLC's system.
Each shipper/pooler/marketer is responsible for contacting their 
interruptible customers to curtail demand if necessary to meet this order. 
Marketers/Poolers are responsible for maintaining interruptible customer 
contact information. Any customer contact information in GOS is for AGLC 
internal use and is not intended to be marketers/poolers point of contact for 
curtailments.
If you have any questions regarding the demand mismatch order, please call 
Brad Freeman at 404-584-4993, or Gas Operations at 404-584-4477.

As an update to many of you, I have been on the phone with Roger Kohn of EPA
Region 9 a couple of different times today.  It turns out that what they
really were expecting to see was something more like a formal Biological
Assessment (BA) for CS 3 and CS 4, not a biological survey report like we
provided.  According to the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the lead Federal
agency in a Federal Action is responsible for preparing the BA, but a BA is
typically only required when the action "may affect" a listed species, which
is not the case here.  EPA Region 9, and based on our experience across the
country, apparently only Region 9, is interpreting their responsibilities
under the ESA very strictly and somewhat "oddly."  Regardless, the bottom
line is that it appears we could argue with them ad nauseum and still end up
right back here.  So, we have begun working very quickly and diligently to
put together a "BA-like" document that, according to Roger, will give them
what they need to put in their files to cover themselves for satisfying the
ESA.

I told him that the USFWS typically (under "normal" circumstances) receives
a BA from the lead federal agency and then issues their Biological Opinion
(BO).  I asked him if they (EPA) were going to still feel like they needed
any kind of concurrence from the USFWS.  He said that only if we were going
to have any findings of "may affect" would they maybe feel the need to get
additional concurrence from the USFWS.  I told him that you (Larry) already
have a verbal concurrence from USFWS that there are no issues, in addition
to the fact that our surveys confirmed that.  I told him that our "BA-like"
document is going to come to the same conclusions that our Survey Report did
(i.e., No Effect).  He said that he understands, and will likely just
receive the document, assure himself that it says what it needs to say, and
is formatted in the manner he feels it needs to be formatted, put it in his
files, and put out the Public Notice for a 30-day comment period.  If this
all happens by early next week, we should still have permits by the
beginning of November. I will continue to hammer home the importance of that
schedule.  Some of us will be on a conference call with Roger and one of the
EPA attorneys tomorrow to try to "get inside their heads" a little bit
better regarding why they are the only Region interpreting their ESA
responsibilities so strictly.  We will debrief you after the call.  Scott

John, to my knowledge there are no ciritical habitats at either site.  In
my previous life as a consultant I did a considerable amount of work with
ESA in NM and AZ and on reservation lands.  To add to this, the whole
disturbance issue of compressor station activities from 1967 (sta. 2) and
1959 (sta.3) would strongly support your supposition that there wont be any
surprises.  Ive spoken to Region IX EPA and this issue wont delay the
processing of the permits for either station.  I would think that from the
time the reports are completed to clearnace by the Navajo Nation, would be
about 30 days.  That is the approximate time limit  that the SHPO
clearances received.  Again, weve received verbal clearance from the Navajo
Nation at these sites regarding T&Es.  The project start point is station
2, so we have some room in the event the survey approvals take longer than
30 days, but I agree with you that we need to move this along.  Ill be more
than happy to motivate the Navajos and EPA after the reports are
submitted.....Scott Patti has promised me he would let me know when the
Navajos have said "yes" and he would charge into the field and do the
surveys.

Please proceed with all haste on this.  How long to complete them and

endangered plants in any of those station yards - I trust?  The EPA is
reaching here, but they have the big stick and we must work through this to
get the air permit.  This is a lesson's learned for the upcoming Sun Devil
project.  John

     The issue arose when the EPA in San Francisco said they would not
     issue an air permit unless we had addressed all concerns relevant to
     the endangered species act, even on distsurbed lands at stations 3 and
     4.  Even though we had received a verbal approval formt he Navajo
     Nation that endangered species would not be a concern by the Nation,
     the EPA felt otherwise.  This means that they wont give us a permit
     until we do a survey for plants and animals.  Because ENSR was on the
     list of contractors approved by the Navajo Nation, they were given the
     opportunity.  As you know, I have been working with Scott Patti on
     this and we have worked it through.  All that is left is to get the
     ENSR renewal permit application approved by the Nation and ENSR is off
     and running to do the surveys.  Terry, I know that you know all this,
     I just wanted to keep John and Bill in the loop on how things are
     progressing......

     Larry,

     I understand from Scott Patti that the EPA has thrown a monkey wrench
     into
     the air permitting process for stations 3 and 4 and are now requesting
     endangered species surveys.  For simplicity, we will add this as a new
     task
     for the Red Rock Expansion project.  The FT. Collins folks are
     proceeding
     based on your verbal go ahead, but to make our accountants happy, I
     will
     have to get something written authorizing the additional work.  Scott
     is
     estimating the task to cost approximately $7,000.  Since I am listed
     as the
     project manager on paper, I will put together a brief letter and get
     it to
     you this week.  However, please continue to directly coordinate with
     Scott
     and he will keep me apprised of the status.

     Thanks,

     Terry.

I think its time that we did a maintenace spot check on the White units at 
the above referenced facility, to stay in line with the operating conditions 
of the facility permit.  It  would probably be a good idea to check on the 
emissions status of the Whites at the same time.

Subject: field visit of EOTT tanks

In the final phase of developing and determining environmental compliance for 
the EOTT crude oil tanks in the Midland Region, I have planned a one day site 
visit on the following days to visit each team location to finalize the 
spreadsheet for EOTT crude oil tank environmental compliance:

Andrews team  August 20 8:00 am

Spraberry team  August 21 8:00 am

Lamesa team  August 22 9:00 am
 
I would appreciate one member from each team be available at the team office 
on the assigned day and time to discuss tank history and possibly visit each 
tank farm within the teams area of responsibility. Your patience and 
assistance in finalizing this information will be greatly appreciated. If a 
conflict arises, give me a call at (505) 625-8022.

Mike
We completed decontamination of the inlet filter at the selexol plant today. 
It was dirty but 
no liquid. There was some dried sludge in the bottom of the vessel and the 
filters were 
extremely dirty. We plan to do both of the filters on the discharge side 
tomorrow.I got a phone 
messsage from Jeff and he hasn't heard anything from PGE since the letter was 
sent . We will 
plan to bypass and clean the filter on the west side of the river, last one 
on our system Saturday
unless we hear something different tomorrow. We will notify the PGE operators 
of their plant 
tomorrow of our plans.If anyone needs to contact me my pager number is 
1-800-921-9564 and office
phone number is 505-260-4003. Leave a message on the office phone and it will 
automatically
page me. I'll give everyone an update late tomorrow. We should have the hot 
tap valves on location 
tomorrow for the selexol injection. We plan to install the valves as soon as 
they arrive.

Thanks RJ

By the way Bisti came on line today and they plan to run it tonight and be 
back on location to 
check on the unit tomorrow.

George, Ive read through your stuff on the Gomez remediation and need some 
help.  Why are we collecting so much groundwater.  Im concerned that charges 
for twice weekly disposal may be perceived as excessive, even though the 
costs are reasonable.  Are we trying to dewater or what?  Other than that, I 
dont mind ensuring the protection of the upstream spring and think we should 
get busy on the well installations.  Do you think this will do it with 
respect to no more wells needed.  Id like to get to that position as quickly 
as possible.

Ester Antonio at the Laguna Tribal Office had contacted Norm Gonzales (Laguna 
Team) last week with some questions regarding a permit the Tribe was going to 
issue to TW for drilling the six additional off-site monitor wells. The 
questions were in regard to: 1) project start and complete date; and 2) who 
to issue the permit to. I contacted Ester this afternoon to discuss these 
items. Ester will issue the permit to Norm Gonzales with a start date of 
1/17/00 and a complete date of 2/17/00. Ester indicated that the permit can 
be reissued with different dates if necessary. Ester also indicated that I 
should contact Thurman "TJ" Robinson with the BIA Laguna Office regarding 
NEPA documentation. I contacted TJ and he said that he has submitted the 
paperwork for a "categorical exclusion" for the additional wells. TJ said 
that this was submitted to the BIA office in Albuquerque and that we could 
still shoot for January 17th as a start date. He said he would fax a copy of 
the document to me once he receives it. He also indicated that he still 
needed to check into whether there is a fee associated with the submittal and 
he would get back to me on this issue.

John, I have attached the site characteristics for the 4 locations in Az. 
where Transwestern plans to install the four RB211's.  With this information 
please provide emissions quarantees for each location (sta. 1-4).  We will 
use the same gas quality for each location.  I have a meeting with the agency 
on the 26th of Feb. and would greaatly appreciate the guarantees prior to 
this date.  If possible, I am going to try and permit each site for 45 ppm 
NOx as opposed to the 25 ppm NOx number, so I would appreciate your 
assistance in this also.

Gentlemen,

As you are aware, David Roensch, Larry Campbell and I just traveled to Penn 
State University and had a lengthy meeting with Dr. Adawaumi.  This meeting 
was mainly related to obtaining an update on exactly where they were in 
progressing with the PCB Behavioral and Hydrodynamic Model for TW's Pipeline 
System.  For your reference I have attached to this note what I consider to 
be the key points from that meeting.   I hope you will take a few moments and 
review the attachment.  I will be glad to discuss any questions you might 
have.  

Based on what we learned during the meeting with Dr. Adawaumi, I am 
recommending that we have a meeting in the near future to discuss what the 
appropriate next steps should be related to whether or not we enter into 
Phase II (which would include cleaning an actual segment of TW's system) of 
this process.  My Secretary will be contacting you in the next few days to 
establish a time when you would be available for such a meeting (4 hours is 
needed).  For this meeting, Dr. Adawaumi will be asked to come down from PSU 
to make about a one hour presentation related to his findings and 
recommendations at this point.

I believe you will find this very informative and essential in establishing 
what our next steps will be.  

Thanks, John Shafer

Subject: NMED Compliance Order

** Proprietary **

Lou,

I received you phone message and fax.  I tried to reach Larry Campbell on 
Friday morning, but got his voice mail which indicated he was traveling until 
Monday.  I hope to talk with Larry on Monday about this matter.

You are correct that the legislature amended the Air Act this past session to 
include a statute of limitations governing enforcement actions.  That 
amendment (H.B. 278) provides that "no action for civil penalty shall be 
commenced more than five years from the date the violation was known by the 
department or local agency."   (to be codified at NMSA Sec. 74-2-12.1).  The 
amendment became effective on June 15, 2001, the day after the NMED issued 
the compliance order here.  NMED doubtless will assert that the limitations 
period is not applicable here because it was not in effect at the time they 
initiated the action by filing the Compliance Order. (Ah what a difference a 
day makes.)  I will need to take a quick look to evaluate the strength of 
their position and our position that the limitations period should apply.

Charlie de Saillan used to be counsel to the New Mexico Natural Resources 
Trustee.  He departed from that position nearly a year ago and, after short 
time off, went to NMED.  He and Eric Ames are the two folks handling air 
issues these days.  I have dealt with Charlie in the past.  He is generally 
pleasant to deal with, but not always flexible in his views.  My sense is 
that he will want to strike some kind of a deal to resolve this and is not 
likely to insist on pressing for the full $15,000 per day for each day of 
violation.  From your voice mail message, it sounds like NMED was advised of 
the change out of the engines.  I will be curious to learn more about what 
they were told or provided in writing and when. I will flesh all that out 
with Larry when I speak to him.

I will be out of the office in the morning but will try to catch up with you 
and Larry as soon as I get in.

Following our conference call this morning and the consensus we reached, I 
placed a call to Rod Boschee and we discussed the following items.  One of 
the key points Rod made is summarized at bullet four below.  Evidently, they 
want to take the maximum amount of gas from us for as long as they can.

We appreciated his phone call and the cooperative effort that was working 
well.  I told Rod that we were also very pleased with the results experienced 
since the June 29 cleaning and testing of the separators.  As far as we knew 
TW's system was staying dry and we were moving no significant liquids into 
their separator.
TW would go along with PG&E and agree that we would not take the system down 
in mid-September to re-check the separators at this point since we were not 
seeing any alarming numbers or quantities.
In place of taking the system down in mid-September, TW and PG&E would watch 
for an upset and a large quantity or a higher concentration - if that occurs, 
then we would immediately get together and plan a time to take the system 
down and check things out.
PG&E is requesting that TW keep flow rates up the rest of the summer, all 
fall and into the winter.  PG&E might want us to take the system down and 
check the separators sometime next year - but they want to talk about going 
as long as we can before we do that.  
Rod agreed that we would still meet as planned in October in Las Vegas.  
(Caveat:  Because of all of the EOTT things going on and other related 
issues, it would help my schedule greatly if we could shift that proposed 
meeting from October 10 to anytime the week of October 16 or October 23?  I 
would appreciate it if Mike Nelson or David Roensch could arrange the meeting 
to be delayed a week or so).  The agenda for the meeting would be related to 
updating everyone on testing results, scheduling the down-time at a mutually 
agreeable time next year for checking the separators, build-out of certain 
facilities on their system related to receiving TW's gas, etc.   
We would agree to do nothing about the 1800' of interconnecting pipe at this 
point.
If you have any questions, please advise.  John Shafer

Larry,

I am attaching a graph that shows how the CO emissions increase exponentially
(vppm) as the turbine operating power is lowered.  The 50% base load CO levels
are between 215 and 250 vppm.

This graph also shows a wider ambient temperature range.

As stated on the phone today the 45 vppm NOx levels are achievable across the
entire operating range.

I apologize for the SI units on the graph, but I ran out of time to convert 
the
chart to imperial units, but hopefully it helps for you to understand the
concept.

Call me at home this weekend, if you need anything.

Kenny,
             I have found some information on this report, I have a copy of
the report that was filed for "99".

The reporting requirements are contained in Part 191 of Title 49 of the
Code of Federal Regulations,"Transportaion of Natural and Other Gas by
Pipeline: Annual Reports and Incident Reports." Each operator of a nonrural
gathering system or of a transmission system must submit an annual report
Form RSPA F 7100.2-1 for the preceding calendar year not later than March
15. Be sure to report TOTAL Miles of pipeline in the system at the end of
the reporting year, including additions to the system during the year.

Please contact me on this and we can get it filled out and turned in. We
must retain a copy for our records which will be stored at NCL.
Thanks,
                Scott

someone who fills out this form for all gas lines? I can fill it out I just
want to make sure there is not any duplication.

A meeting was held with the third party attorney who is providing assistance 
with the recently issued NOV for the P-1 C/S over a like for like turbine 
exchange which occurred in 1996.  A history was given of the incidents which 
led up to the NOV being issued and results of the meeting which Transwestern 
had with the AQB in 1996 which lead Transwestern to believe that issue had 
been resolved.  

The calendar year 2000 PCB annual document logs were prepared and submitted 
to each generator of PCBs on the Transwestern system.

Training was given to the Midland Region over the correct completion and 
submittal of forms used to report natural gas releases  to the TNRCC.  The 
agency has updated and has become more stringent with respect to Regional 
requirements for the reportable releases which are submitted to them.  An 
incomplete form submittal by a compressor station facility near MIdland led 
to this emergency training being given.  Based upon a phone call with Region 
7 of the TNRCC, the agency stated that they will be issuing NOV's to 
facilities that submit incomplete "Upset/Maintenance NOtification Forms for 
Reportable Events".

Larry,
Here is the DFG-1603 notification cover letter and Attachment 1 (project
description and responses to questionnaire). This notification is required
for any disturbance of streams, rivers, wetlands, etc.  Unfortunately, the
State DFG requires notification as the area in question appears as a "blue
line" on USGS maps and is also a designated floodway.  The actual DFG forms
(2 pg notification and 3 pg enviro. questionnaire) and attachments will be
faxed to you and hard copy Fed-Ex'd today.  The other attachments are
available only in hard copy and will also be included in the package.
(Sorry, I missed the Fed-Ex pick-up last night).

I had dinner tonight with a Robert Jacobs EOTT  V.P. West Coast and Ed 
Attanasio EOTT Senior Counsel.  This dinner meeting was put together by Gary 
Fuller.  Both Jacobs and Attansio expressed serious concern about ETS's 
abilty to provide environmental expertise and representation at the EOTT 
Bakersfield facilities due to Gary's departure.  They were concerned because 
of the numerous visits by state regulatory personnel conducting unnounced 
onsite inspections and the fact that EOTT may not have an onsite 
environmental representative.  They were highly complementary of Gary and 
were aware of the good repoire he had established with the agencies and they 
felt they would be losing this repoire and credibility if his position was 
not filled with a person located in Bakersfield.  As a courtesy to our 
customer, I told them I would pass on this information to the powers to be in 
Houston.  

After a review of the environmental records and the compliance load for what 
Gary has responsible for,  Im wondering if we should  fill the Bakersfield 
position, or move that position to Midland and possibly use Gary as a 
"temporary technical contact" for ETS.  As you may or may not know, Gary is 
accepting a position with a bakersfield consulting company which specializes 
in providing operation services for energy companys.  Gary will be in charge 
of the environmental  and safety responsibilities for those companies which 
choose to use their service. 

 I understand that there is some environmental sensitivity in California that 
does, at times go above what is required in other states.  However, getting 
the employees at the Bakersfield location on board with skill base pay will 
alleviate much of the existing workload.  What the employees can't handle or 
issues that are above the skill base pay level requirements, can be handled 
and addressed  by Butch and myself with Gary's occasional assistance.  Having 
Gary as a technical contact living in Bakersfield will satisify EOTT's 
concern of having an environmental expert  available for those times when 
agencies arrive unnounced and  at the same time give EOTT the comfort and 
security that they want by knowing that they will be represented by a person 
of Gary's reputation and character. 

In line with this, there appears to be a larger workload and work area in 
MIdland rather than in Bakersfield.  Remediation activites, permitting and 
compliance will be a full time position with the EOTT, Transwestern and 
Northern faciltiies which comprise the Midland area.  In this area, there are 
approximately 13 field teams to provide technical assistance and training 
for.  I feel this will be a full time job.  I think we should give 
consideration to possible using Gary's expertise on a part time basis in 
Bakersfield and relocate and fill his position in Mildand, Tx.

Byron,

Below is the letter I committed to provide Arnold this afternoon.  I see
that Vadim beat me to it by sending you an earlier email.  As a general
commentary, I would however, like to make the following clarifications on
the subject which ETS may find useful.

Particulate matter in the gas tubine exhaust comes from a variety of sources
and may include smoke, ash, corrosion and erosion products, condensable
hydrocarbons, inlet air particulates and particulates from the fuel and
injected water or steam when applicable.  In addition, SO3 in the exhaust is
generally trapped on a wet collection medium as H2SO4 and may appear as
particulates due to the measurement procedure.

Gas turbines are very clean burning and are not, in general, sources of
significant quantities of particulate emissions when burning good quality
fuels.  With distillate fuel containing less than 0.5% by weight, sulfur,
total particulates at high power are expected to be less than 0.6 lbs. per
1000 lb. fuel as measured by EPA Method 5.  Please note that the method used
for measuring particulate matter can have a significant impact on the
particulate level determined.  For estimating purposes, all particulates may
be considered to be in the size range less than 10 micrometers.

With pipeline quality natural gas, there is virtually no smoke and the fuel
contains no sulfur or ash.  As a result, total engine generated particulate
emissions are generally undetectable by EPA Method 5.  Due to other
particulate sources and the sensitivity of the measurement method, total
particulates with pipeline quality natural gas for the LM2500 are estimated
to be less than 3 pounds per hour assuming cleanliness levels for the inlet
air, fuel, and water/steam injection in accordance with GE requirements.

Regards, Jos,.

HOLIDAY SAFETY REMINDER

The holiday season can mean an increased risk of fires and a higher potenti=

shopping and because of the increased number of special events and office=
=20
parties.  We would like to pass along a few safety and security tips from t=
he=20
City of Houston Fire Department and the Houston Police Department.

? Please do not prop open stairwell doors or doors to the freight elevators=
. =20
This defeats security.=20

? Use only artificial trees and greenery in decorating your office space. D=
o=20
not place cut trees or greenery within the building. Cut trees become major=

fire hazards when they dry out.

? Office parties or the holiday mood may distract you.  Be alert for thieve=
s=20
who try to take advantage of the holiday season. Sometimes just having fewe=
r=20
people at work during the holidays creates an opening for thieves. If you s=
ee=20
someone that does not appear to belong in your work area, immediately call=
=20
the Enron Security Console at 713-853-5360.

? Keep your purse or wallet with you at all times or locked away in a drawe=
r=20
or closet.

? If you go shopping, invite a friend to go along. Try not to overload=20
yourself with packages.  When you return, lock your gifts away in a safe=20
place.

? Always be aware of your surroundings while in a public area. If things do=
n=01,
t look right, follow your instincts and avoid going into the area.

? When waiting for a ride home after hours, remain inside the building near=
 a=20
card-reader door until you see your ride arrive.=20

? If office parties are on company premises and involve alcoholic beverages=
=20
or public invitees, call security at 713-853-5360.  Security will advise yo=

marketrelations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants

Many Market Participants recognized the mismatch in prices which were posted 
on
the NYISO website versus those which were used for billing in the settlement
statements.

The NYISO has identified the various differences and has modified software
necessary to update and / or correct the prices associated with the categories
listed below;

Upon completion of all the Historical LBMP updates noted below, the NYISO will
recompute and post new real time weighted files.  Information on what 
intervals
have been changed, as a result of a specific issue noted below, will be
provided.

Issue #1:  Prices and Postings During Reserve Pickup Intervals:
During instances where the dispatch interval is in response to a  Reserve 
Pickup
request, the price which will be used to bill a Reserve Pickup (RPU)  period 
is
the price associated with the most recent normal SCD execution interval
preceding the reserve pickup interval. There were limited instances during the
first 11 months of operation where an LBMP was incorrectly calculated and 
posted
for the reserve pickup intervals.

Solution Issue #1:  For the period 11/99 until the present, all RPU intervals
that were inadvertently posted with price calculations based on the reserve
pickup intervals will be replaced with the price from the dispatch cycle
immediately preceding the reserve pickup.  Any modifications made which result
in changes to the billing data will be corrected through the re-bill and 
true-up
process in future months.


Issue #2:  Posted Price Discrepancies Between Proxy Bus and Load Bus Prices:
During the process of correcting and reposting prices, the Generator or proxy
bus prices were updated, but not the Zonal or load prices.

Solution Issue #2: ALL proxy gen prices which are different from their
corresponding zonal prices, will be copied into the zonal bus prices to
overwrite any possible discrepancies between these two files, as these should 
be
identical. NOTE: The Billing & Accounting System (BAS) was coded to use the
generator proxy bus price.  Therefore the BAS calculations have been 
consistent
with the generator proxy price and should not affect any bills.


Issue #3:  Missing SCD Intervals In Pass of Data Between SCD and PTS- Due to
Loss of Communications:
At times there periods exist when communication links between operating 
systems,
namely SCD and Performance Tracking (PTS) in this case, have failed and have 
to
be manually reactivated.  During these sub-system failure periods, SCD 
intervals
are being saved and when communications are restored or through the price
correction process the SCD intervals are restored.  During these failure 
periods
the SCD Start/Stop signals are not being transferred to the PTS. Six-second
actual data continues to be received by PTS during these failure periods.  PTS
develops an average actual value over the SCD interval periods. During the
failure periods the PTS observations do not match the number of SCD interval
observations. The BAS is coded to ignore any intervals where there is not a
match between the price file and the metered MW files. For example, if SCD had
intervals for :05, :10 and :15 and the PTS integrated actuals covered the 
period
:05 - :15 then the BAS would calculate the billing based on the consistent 
sets
of data, The interval then becomes a 10 minute interval.

Solution Issue #3 The system will be programmed such that it will recognize 
when
an interval is missing in PTS and the PTS interval will be generated by
splitting the large interval,  with the assumption that the energy was 
delivered
uniformly over the entire interval.   Retroactive to Nov'99, the missing
intervals will be created.  Through the monthly rebill and true-up process,
these intervals will be used and billing results may change as a result.

Issue #4:  Dispatch Interval Type "R"
When SCD is in a reserve pickup, and the pick-up is unsuccessful after 10
minutes, an extra PTS interval is generated for performance tracking of units.
This interval is not an actual interval where basepoints are calculated and 
sent
to generators.  At the time the PTS intervals are sent to the MIS, an LBMP
interval is also sent.    These intervals were posted on the OASIS and then
ignored in BAS.

Solution Issue #4 Retroactively to Nov'99, all LBMP intervals generated as 
part
of the reserve pickup performance tracking process will be deleted.  In the
future, the intervals will not be sent to MIS for posting.

Issue #5:  Consistent Updated Price Postings
Prior to January 2000, intervals updated as part of price corrections were
posted to a different spot on the OASIS in a different format,  thus making it
difficult for market participants to locate the correct data.

Solution Issue #5 Retroactively to Nov'99, an update of the current LBMP 
posting
files will be accomplished to include the price corrections not originally
posted.


The intent of the NYISO is to have all corrections for retroactive price 
posting
discrepancies, and software enhancements completed by the end of Nov 2000.

Rich, thanx for the sampling update.  Ill pass it along to the apropriate 
parties.  A cursory look at the data shows it to be inconsistently up and 
down, as expected, with no glaring increases.  Anything urgent we need to 
discuss?

Exchanges that became eligible for decimalized trading on September 
25, 2000. Qualified investors can now make decimalized equity and

Most people don't think so. But the pros at Motley Fool point out 
that a bearish dip in prices can make stocks more affordable for the 
average investor. If you missed the boat on the bulls, or want to go

your future might be something to cheer about. more>>

Subject: SPS Grandfathered agreement on Blackwater tie.


This is an announcement of a working policy for making service across
the Blackwater tie into WSCC in the event the SPS , bundled,
grandfathered is temporarily interrupted.  In order to preserve
competition without displacing the reservation close to the ramp, SPS
has agreed to notify SPP prior to the top of each hour whether or not
they will be making any attempt to restore the IP agreement at the top
of the next hour.  Once that designation has been declared, SPP will
open the market at the top of the hour for next-hour only service to the
BLKW DC Tie.  SPS has stated that 12/12/2000 HE 19 will be available for
service.  A similar notice will be posted to the OASIS and SPP will
follow this policy until further notice.

ENRON
Is Enron Overpriced?
It's in a bunch of complex businesses. Its financial statements are nearly=
=20
impenetrable. So why is Enron trading at such a huge multiple?
Bethany McLean
Mon Mar 05 00:00:00 EST 2001

In Hollywood parlance, the "It Girl" is someone who commands the  spotlight=
=20
at any given moment--you know, like Jennifer Lopez or Kate  Hudson. Wall=20
Street is a far less glitzy place, but there's still such a  thing as an "I=
t=20
Stock." Right now, that title belongs to Enron, the  Houston energy giant.=
=20
While tech stocks were bombing at the box office  last year, fans couldn't=
=20
get enough of Enron, whose shares returned 89%.  By almost every measure, t=
he=20
company turned in a virtuoso performance:  Earnings increased 25%, and=20
revenues more than doubled, to over $100  billion. Not surprisingly, the=20
critics are gushing. "Enron has built  unique and, in our view, extraordina=
ry=20
franchises in several usiness  units in very large markets," says Goldman=
=20
Sachs analyst David Fleischer.=20

Along with "It" status come high multiples and high expectations. Enron  no=
w=20
trades at roughly 55 times trailing earnings. That's more than 2 1/2  times=
=20
the multiple of a competitor like Duke Energy, more than twice  that of the=
=20
S=02?500, and about on a par with new-economy sex symbol  Cisco Systems. En=
ron=20
has an even higher opinion of itself. At a  late-January meeting with=20
analysts in Houston, the company declared that  it should be valued at $126=
 a=20
share, more than 50% above current levels.  "Enron has no shame in telling=
=20
you what it's worth," says one portfolio  manager, who describes such=20
gatherings as "revival meetings." Indeed,  First Call says that 13 of Enron=
's=20
18 analysts rate the stock a buy.=20

But for all the attention that's lavished on Enron, the company remains =20
largely impenetrable to outsiders, as even some of its admirers are  quick =
to=20
admit. Start with a pretty straightforward question: How  exactly does Enro=
n=20
make its money? Details are hard to come by because  Enron keeps many of th=
e=20
specifics confidential for what it terms  "competitive reasons." And the=20
numbers that Enron does present are often  extremely complicated. Even=20
quantitatively minded Wall Streeters who  scrutinize the company for a livi=
ng=20
think so. "If you figure it out, let  me know," laughs credit analyst Todd=
=20
Shipman at S&P. "Do you have a  year?" asks Ralph Pellecchia, Fitch's credi=
t=20
analyst, in response to the  same question.=20

To skeptics, the lack of clarity raises a red flag about Enron's pricey =20
stock. Even owners of the stock aren't uniformly sanguine. "I'm somewhat =
=20
afraid of it," admits one portfolio manager. And the inability to get  behi=
nd=20
the numbers combined with ever higher expectations for the  company may=20
increase the chance of a nasty surprise. "Enron is an  earnings-at-risk=20
story,'' says Chris Wolfe, the equity market strategist  at J.P. Morgan's=
=20
private bank, who despite his remark is an Enron fan.  "If it doesn't meet=
=20
earnings, [the stock] could implode."=20

What's clear is that Enron isn't the company it was a decade ago. In  1990=
=20
around 80% of its revenues came from the regulated gas-pipeline  business.=
=20
But Enron has been steadily selling off its old-economy iron  and steel=20
assets and expanding into new areas. In 2000, 95% of its  revenues and more=
=20
than 80% of its operating profits came from "wholesale  energy operations a=
nd=20
services." This business, which Enron pioneered,  is usually described in=
=20
vague, grandiose terms like the  "financialization of energy"--but also, mo=
re=20
simply, as "buying and  selling gas and electricity." In fact, Enron's view=
=20
is that it can  create a market for just about anything; as if to underscor=
e=20
that point,  the company announced last year that it would begin trading=20
excess  broadband capacity.=20

But describing what Enron does isn't easy, because what it does is =20
mind-numbingly complex. CEO Jeff Skilling calls Enron a "logistics  company=
"=20
that ties together supply and demand for a given commodity and  figures out=
=20
the most cost-effective way to transport that commodity to  its destination=
.=20
Enron also uses derivatives, like swaps, options, and  forwards, to create=
=20
contracts for third parties and to hedge its  exposure to credit risks and=
=20
other variables. If you thought Enron was  just an energy company, have a=
=20
look at its SEC filings. In its 1999  annual report the company wrote that=
=20
"the use of financial instruments  by Enron's businesses may expose Enron t=
o=20
market and credit risks  resulting from adverse changes in commodity and=20
equity prices, interest  rates, and foreign exchange rates."=20

Analyzing Enron can be deeply frustrating. "It's very difficult for us  on=
=20
Wall Street with as little information as we have," says Fleischer,  who is=
 a=20
big bull. (The same is true for Enron's competitors, but  "wholesale=20
operations" are usually a smaller part of their business, and  they trade a=
t=20
far lower multiples.) "Enron is a big black box," gripes  another analyst.=
=20
Without having access to each and every one of Enron's  contracts and its=
=20
minute-by-minute activities, there isn't any way to  independently answer=
=20
critical questions about the company. For instance,  many Wall Streeters=20
believe that the current volatility in gas and power  markets is boosting=
=20
Enron's profits, but there is no way to know for  sure. "The ability to=20
develop a somewhat predictable model of this  business for the future is=20
mostly an exercise in futility," wrote Bear  Stearns analyst Robert Winters=
=20
in a recent report.

The introductory page on the web site states: "To ensure consistent 
interpretation of Statewide Rules 8, 20, and 91, as they pertain to crude oil 
and condensate spills, the RRC has issued two field sampling guidance 
documents....Both of the field guides describe reporting, sampling and 
analysis requirements as well as provide the default cleanup concentrations.  
In all cases an apppropriate risk assessment may be used in lieu of the 
defaullt cleanup concentrations".

The guidelines are effective November 1, 2000.  The condensate guideline is 
temporary until the RBCA guidelines become available.  The Texas Railroad 
Commission plans to issue the RBCA guidelines by the end of this year.

"Kirkpatrick, Joe" <joe.kirkpatrick@nrgenergy.com> writes to the 
NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

There are still no answers to the questions (below).

In addition to this I am curious that when the NYISO requests generation for
ISO security it is only Transmission Owner generation that is dispatched,
undoubtedly avoiding merchant generation from being dispatched. I was
wondering where the tariff language is to justify this type of out-of-merit
generation dispatch.

What deficiencies are there in the SCD software that it cannot handle load
pickups?
What is an NYISO SCD reserve pickup, and how does it affect generation from
setting clearing prices?

Why do these questions go unanswered, if there is tariff language to support
this please point me in the right direction.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------

I have a question or two with regard to the following "Operational
Announcements" (Below). These are a few examples of many that are requests
for generation being requested out-of-merit by the NYISO for NYISO security.

In my limited understanding of the way SCD works I had thought that the only
reason the ISO or a Transmission Owner would request generation out-of-merit
is to resolve for a constraint or system condition that SCD could not (set
me straight if I am off-base).
Requesting generation out-of-merit to resolve for system security is an
effective method of quickly resolving for an out-of-scope SCD system problem
and by definition will not set clearing price.

1. What are the rules and procedures in place to request generation
out-of-merit both for local (Transmission Owner) and ISO request.
2. What other control actions have to be exhausted prior to initiating a
request for generation to be called on out-of-merit.
3. Are the generation bids available to the requestor(s) prior to making the
request. (Is economics a consideration?)
4. When load is available to be dispatched, will it be considered as a
control action instead of generation?
5. Is generation called on out-of-merit to resolve for DNI constraints.
6. In particular for Gilboa it was my understanding that prior to requesting
additional generation from Gilboa that an emergency was to take place. Is
there another agreement in place between the NYISO and NYPA. Below is an
excerpt from the ICAP manual.

4.4.2 Energy Limited Resources

Energy Limited Resources that are ICAP suppliers must be able to provide the
Energy equivalent of their claimed ICAP for four (4) hours each day. Energy
Limited Resources must bid or schedule in the Day-Ahead Market for
twenty-four (24) hours each day in such a way as to enable the NYISO to
schedule them for the period in which they are capable of providing the
energy.
An Energy Limited Resource must also provide the NYISO with information
concerning the hours during which it will be recharging or replacing
depleted
resources. Once the resource has provided four hours of Energy equivalent
ICAP, the NYISO will not call on an Energy Limited Resource during its
recharge
hours, except in the case of an emergency.

Under the regulations of the state of Arizona, facilities which have a 
pollution prevention plan (sta.1, sta. 2 and Needles) are required to have an 
annual training to evaluate pollution prevention activiies.  I have scheduled 
with the above three facilities to have pollution training on the following 
dates:

  Kingman team June 21

  Flagstaff team June 22

This training is to be completed by July 1 of every year.  This training will 
last for approximately 2-3 hours.  Employees that works at any of the three 
facilities are required to be present for the training.  Your participation 
in this will be greatly appreciated.

A meeting was held with the Eunice Team to assign roles and responsibilities 
for the newly issued Title V air permit for the NNG Eunice C/S.  The permit 
is similiar to the other title V permits issued to New Mexico faciliites.

Assisted the Gallup Team with the preparation, completion and submittal of 
the Title V semi anual compliance monitoring report and annual certification 
report.

The state of New Mexico Air Quality Bureau conducted an inspection of the 
Wt-1 C/S.  This inspection is interesting in the fact that all combustion 
equipment has been removed and dismantled and replaced by electric units.  
Written notification was submitted to the agency several months ago and a 
written reply was received from the agency that the facility is exempt from 
any and all permitting requirements.

A meeting was held with the Artesia Team to assign roles and responsibilities 
for the newly issued Title V air permit for the Atoka No. 3 C/S.  Also 
discussed was the permitting approach which will be followed for the approval 
to install micro pre combustion chambers on two White units which were found 
to be out of compliance with the air permit emissions limits when the New 
Mexico Air Quality Bureau conducted a surprise inspection at the facility.

I spoke with Eduardo Acosta at the TNRCC.  He has stated that if a turbine
is not subject to any NSPS or 30 TAC 117 requirements you don't have to list
them on an OP-UA form.  I've prepared the renewals with an OP-UA11 form that
makes a negative Subpart GG applicability statement.  However, if you prefer
I can remove these forms.  Having the forms in the permit makes it clear to
an inspector that the turbine is "grandfathered" from GG.  What is your
preference?

Re:       Extraordinary Corrective Action to Address a Market Design Flaw:

support
to  the  NYISO  to  re-issue  ECA  20001006B  until  the Market Participants 
can
consider  and  approve, and the NYISO can implement, a tariff change required 
to
permanently address the Market Design Flaw.

As  stated  in  my Memorandum to you of October 6, 2000, I agreed with your
conclusion that the conduct identified at that time constituted a 

?Market Design
Flaw?  as  defined  in  Attachment  Q  to  the ISO OATT, Temporary 
Extraordinary
Procedures  for  Correcting  Market  Design  Flaws  and  Addressing 
Transitional
Abnormalities (the ?TEPs?).  As further stated in that Memorandum, I agreed 
with
your  analysis that prices produced by exploiting this Market Design Flaw 
would,
absent  appropriate  action,  remain  different  from what would otherwise 
occur
during periods of efficient competition.

I  have  now  determined,  based  on  consultations  with ISO Staff and the
support  of the Business Issues Committee, that it is appropriate to maintain 
in
effect  the  corrective measures adopted as ECA 20001006B while consultation 
and
cooperation with the Market Participants and jurisdictional agencies is 
on-going
to  develop  and  implement appropriate rules or rule changes in accordance 
with
the ISO Agreement.

Please re-issue the text of the Extraordinary Corrective Action (?ECA?) and
post  it  on  the  OASIS,  for implementation effective at the expiration of 
ECA
20001006B.  The ECA shall be effective for a period of ninety (90) days.

Extraordinary Corrective Action 20001208B

Market Design Flaw Regarding Real-Time External Proxy Bus Prices


Applicability

This  Extraordinary  Correction Action (ECA) shall apply when the following
two conditions are met:

?    Transactions are proposed for an operating hour at an External Proxy Bus;
and
?    The Balancing Market Evaluation (BME) resolves transmission congestion
constraints at the External Proxy Bus for the operating hour, resulting in
transmission congestion charges in the Hour-Ahead Market (HAM).

Rationale

When BME solves for proposed transactions at an External Proxy Bus, and the
total  proposed  transactions  exceed  the available transfer capacity, BME 
will
resolve binding constraints at that External Proxy Bus using the decremental 
bid
price  or  the sink price cap bid indicated by the Market Participants 
proposing
the transactions.

In  the  operating hour, the transfer capability and scheduled flows at the
External  Proxy  Bus  are  fixed,  and  SCD  is  not  required  to  resolve  
for
transmission  congestion  costs  associated  with  the  scheduled  
transactions.
Therefore, in operating hours where an External Proxy Bus constraint is 
binding,
Real-Time  prices at the External Proxy Bus will be significantly different 
from
the  HAM  prices,  due  to  the  absence  of transmission congestion costs 
being
reflected  in  the Real-Time price.  Currently, scheduled HAM transactions at 
an
External  Proxy Bus are settled at the Real-Time price at the External Proxy 
Bus
during  the operating hour, and the import transactions receive a Bid 
Production
Cost Guarantee for the deviation in price between the HAM and Real-Time price.

The  Market  Design  Flaw  in  the  current  process  is  that transmission
congestion  constraints  present  when  BME  schedules  HAM transactions are 
not
reflected  in the Real-Time settlement prices.  Under the rules set forth 
below,
the  transmission  congestion  costs present in BME will be reflected in the 
SCD
prices, so that a Market Participant proposing a HAM transaction will be 
charged
the  full  cost of supplying that transaction, up to the decremental bid cost 
or
sink  price  cap  bid  indicated  by  the Market Participant at the time the 
HAM
transaction was proposed.

Implementation Rules

1.   These rules apply in hours that HAM import or export transactions are
constrained in BME at an External Proxy Bus (EPB) by a transmission limitation
or Desired Network Interchange (DNI) limit (an ?EPB Limit?).

2.   For each hour in which an EPB Limit constrains net imports to NYCA from 
an
External Proxy Bus in the HAM, the Real-Time settlement price at that External
Proxy Bus will be the lesser of the real-time LBMP or the BME price at that
External Proxy Bus.

3.   For each hour which an EPB Limit constrains net exports from NYCA to an
External Proxy Bus in the HAM, the Real-Time settlement price at that External
Proxy Bus will be the greater of the real-time LBMP or the BME price at that
External Proxy Bus.

  I last week received word from the US BLM that Koch Oil failed to fulfill a 
condition in a right of way granted by the BLM in 1997.  Specifically, Koch 
failed to procure 29 acres of habitat compensation acreage.  It is now our 
(EOTT's)  problem, as we can lose this valuable right of way if we do not 
obtain this acreage.  Per the right of way, Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve 
Credits will suffice for this purpose.  Can you please contact Mark Poe of 
Aera, who manages the ecosystem, and tell him we want to negotiate a purchase 
of 29 acres?  He should at least be able to tell you if there is acreage 
available, and for how much.  (Also, Aera has a standard contract for this, 
which you can send to me if you are able to strike a deal for the acreage.)  
Randi McCormick can provide additional technical assistance with this if you 
need it.  

 Of course, we also need to acquire acreage for the Rogas project, but I'd 
like to keep that as a separate transaction because, I will need to attempt 
reimbursement from Koch for this BLM acreage.

 Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. --ETA

Subject: Environmental findings, Koch South Texas Records Review

Randy, this is a short summary of the environmental findings that were 
identified during the records review conducted at the Corpus Christi Koch 
facility offices on May 1st and 2nd of this year.

All environmental records which were available in the file data room at the 
Koch office  were reviewed.  Assumptions were made that the environmental 
records were complete for all assets included in the sale.  Primary emphasis 
was placed on those environmental issues which are normally associated with a 
sale or purchase of assets dealing with distribution and transmission of 
crude oil. In particular, pipeline and tank farms were the most critical 
assets which were reviewed. 

Based upon the data review, the Koch assets were in compliance with the 
following:

  Air permitting, permit by rule, standard expemtions, recordkeeping and fee 
payments were documented 

  NSPS recordkeeping and inspections for VOC control on large crude oil tanks 
were documented 

  Oil Pollution Act-OPA 90 plans had been prepared and were up to date

  SARA compliance and reporting had been completed

  SPCC plans had been prepared for each site which qualified under 40 CFR 112

  Spill reporting history and notifications to the state agency were 
available for review

   There are ongoing groundwater and soil remediation activities at one site 
included in the asset for sale
     (permits for the remediation activity is in place)

  Hazardous waste notifications, annual reportings and fee payments were 
documented

Based upon the above review, there were no issues which could be identified 
which would be condsidered a major environmental limitation or would be a 
considered a major environmental  liability.  This statement is again based 
upon the assumption that all environmental information was present in the 
data room for the assets in question.  It should also be stated that this 
analysis of Koch's environmental compliance is based upon the fact that Koch 
has not held back or provided false or misleading information or knowledge 
during their presentation or informaiton contained in the facility files.

Pending further development and interest of this potential purchase, a 
recommendation is made to conduct a phase I due diligence and site visit to 
each location to verify findings from the records review.   Also, due to the 
past history of Koch's operating practices, it is recommended that contract 
conditions be implicitly stated that EOTT will not be held liable for 
discoveries of past deficiencies or releases of contamination which have 
occurred on any of the Koch assets purchased.

cking@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Roy,

Thanks for sharing your concerns regarding the MOU pilot programs.  I will
include below a portion of the draft minutes from the April 18th NYISO
Management Committee meeting which discuss the NYISO position on the CIT
project.  Initially, this project was viewed as a "quick hit" which could be
completed swiftly, at minimal cost, and with minimal impact on staff and 
ongoing
project work.  Further discussion with PJM reveals that this will not be the
case.

Question on CIT/CSS:

In thinking over the discussions at the BIC meeting I found two areas
related to interactions with PJM where I am a bit confused due to what is
either my misunderstanding, or conflicting information provided by NY and
PJM. I would appreciate it if the NYISO would clarify these items. I will
also make a similar request of PJM.

1) Common interface tool.

My understand from the PJM EMC meeting was that PJM was going basically do
this entirely (or almost entirely) on their own, and just allocate some
costs between NY and PJM. The product as I understood it would be available
to participants of both pools for transactions scheduling. The users would
input to the tool, and NY and PJM would basically get screened/coordinated
input simultaneously in order to accelerate scheduling and minimize checkout
problems etc.

If this was the case, I don't understand the comments at the BIC that NY
wont be able to do this by the summer. Is this a PJM or NY constraint? Is
PJM unable to complete what they offered? I can understand that that would
hold things up as they proposed to do most of the work. However at the PJM
EMC I got the impression that PJM was all set to go, could make the
schedule, and just needed NY agreement. If this is a NY constraint I would
also like to know more about it.

Can you please clarify what is going on here?

Response:

(Reported by Mr. Museler to the MC on 4-18-2001)

1.   There have been recent developments in the NYISO / PJM CIT process.  At 
the
present time, no software requirements document has been created, no vendor
contracts have been signed,  and a number of issues, including ensuring the
confidentiality of data, providing redundancy in New York in case the PJM 
based
system fails, and liability, all have to be resolved.

When the project was originally proposed, the NYISO believed it could be done
quickly with a limited amount of resources.  This has not proven to be the 
case.
Completing this project immediately  would take resources away from other
projects need for Summer 2001 and will have a budget impact of approximately 
$1
million.  The NYISO does not believe it would be prudent to allow this project
to come ahead of the Summer 2001 issues, or to proceed without vendor 
contracts
in place and other outstanding issues resolved.  The NYISO will continue work 
on
the CIT process and will keep the Committees informed of developments.

Question:

2) Inter ISO Congestion Pilot. I was disappointed in the "lukewarm"
presentation that Rick Gonzales made at the BIC. I realize that this program
is very limited in scope, but it seems to me this is a very important
precedent to the future coordination of the ISO's. As we left things it
seems likely that this will die in committee before the summer.

However, I would like a technical explanation of one of things that Rick
said. He commented that one of his discomforts related to a request by PJM
that NY pay for some generation in Northern New Jersey. At first blush this
got a very negative response in the group.

Then I started to think about this more. My understanding is the basic
structure of the agreement is that ISO A only makes payments to ISO B if B
is taking an action such as re-dispatch to ease a constraint in A.  Thus if
PJM was suggesting NY pay for North Jersey generation, presumably this was
to be for PJM adding generation there to ease a NY constraint. Now I am not
a great electrical engineer, but my limited understanding of the systems
suggests to me that if PJM is adding generation in North Jersey to help NY,
this has to do with modification to the PAR flows and support of SENY
through the PSEG cable. Is this correct?

IF CORRECT, DOES THIS MEAN THAT THE NYISO HAS REJECTED A PROPOSAL TO
INCREASE SUPPLIES TO SENY FOR THIS SUMMER BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR
REDISPATCH IN PJM?

I hope that this is an incorrect conclusion, otherwise we have some big
problems.

I would appreciate a further explanation of this, as perhaps I don't
understand what is physically happening.

Thanks for the help

Response:

With regard to the inter-ISO Congestion management pilot, Rick Gonzales offers
the following response to your comments:

2. Please be advised that the NYISO fully supports the Inter-regional 
Congestion
Pilot program. The Congestion Pilot will be presented again for comment at the
Market Structures WG for further discussion and to facilitate the potential
implementation of this program.

One of the major issues noted in the presentation that limits the extent to
which the Pilot program can be used is the potential for cost-shifting between
ISOs. In addition to providing a list of 'candidate' operational constraints, 
it
was also noted that it is the responsibility of each ISO to re-dispatch its
internal control area resources to solve its own internal constraints. This
concept is in agreement with your understanding that 'ISO A only makes 
payments
to ISO B if B is taking an action such as re-dispatch to ease a constraint in
A'.

Any futher conclusions that one might imply from the Inter-regional Congestion
Pilot should be discussed at the next Market Structures WG meeting.

C. King adds the following with regard to the notion of increasing supplies to
SENY and the operation of the PARs (Waldwick & Linden-Goethals/Hudson 
faragut):

Since the initiation of the NYISO Markets, the full capability of the
Hudson-Farragut PARs has not been available due to equipment failure.  The
equipment is expected to be back in service on or about the May-June period.  
In
preparation for the return of the outaged PAR to service, NYISO and PJM staff
have been discussing the operation of the PARs and the relationship of the PAR
schedules to the PSEG-Con Edison Energy Transfer Agreements which have long 
been
associated with this equipment.  It would be pre-mature to establish a
congestion-management pilot involving facilities in the electrical vicinity of
the PARs, until the operating procedures related to the operation of the PARs 
is
fully discussed and agreed to.
Both PJM & NYISO acknowledged this at the Stakeholder Meeting in Toronto 
earlier
this year, so this is nothing new.

Presently the equipment owners (PSEG & Con Edison) as well as NYISO and PJM 
are
engaged in discussions which should ultimately result in an operating 
agreement
between PJM and NYISO regarding the operation and scheduling of the PARs.
Progress is being made, thus I think that every effort is being made to insure
that energy can flow between PJM and SENY, and between NY and New Jersey for
this summer and beyond.  We appreciate your encouragement of these efforts and
other efforts to address seams issues in the northeast.

See you in Springfield next Wednesday!

Chuck

There are numerous emails floating around with suggested changes to the
EDRP and DADRP Manuals. This makes it very difficult for BIC members to
know what is to be voted on Thursday.

Either those wanting changes should come to BIC with motions to modifiy or
we put off the approvals at the moment until there is a better fix on what
it is we are voting for...(or hold revisions for later).

Romance in Paradise!

Dear Larry,

Everyone has their own definition of paradise. For some it's 
unspoiled beaches and lush tropical jungle. For others it's a more 
developed resort. For others, it's not about the outdoors at all--if 
you're one of those people who thinks a place called "Sin City" 
sounds just about perfect, we can help you, too. However you like it, 
Travelocity can help make it happen. Whether you're traveling with 
your sweetie, or just into the romance of traveling, Travelocity can 
help you plan and book the perfect trip. And that sounds like 
paradise to us.

The island of Oahu just might be the perfect place for a romantic 
getaway. That's because if you and your other half can't agree on a 
vacation here, we're not sure you're ever going to agree on anything. 
She likes seclusion, and you like bustle? No problem. Lively Waikiki 
is complemented by dozens of other beaches on the island, some of 
which you'll have practically to yourselves. Or maybe he's a city

Grupo Taca is Currently Offering Sale Fares to Costa Rica!
Costa Rica, with its unspoiled beaches and abundant wildlife, is 
pretty close to paradise on earth. It's not highly developed--don't

and the best birdwatching of your life. If getting away from it all 
is your idea of the perfect vacation, Costa Rica is the place 
for you.

R equirements


1) We have the permit and drawing for boring the Kern County Water Agencies
Cross Valley Canal. I will also contact Helt Engineering for the canal
profile and Soils Engineering for the soil analysis.

2) Permits for Hwy 43 and Interstate 5 are state Permits through Caltrans,
at this time we have not received the permits. Helt Engineering has
repeatedly made calls but are having difficulty getting anyone to answer
the phone. I have asked them to notify Caltrans of who is the contractor
for the project. Alan if you can provide me with the name of the boring
contractor I will provide that information at the same time. If I do not
have an answer soon I will make a trip to Fresno and see what I can find
out. Matt, Floyd Little is the contact for Caltrans, you probably remember
the problems you had when you tried to contact him.

3) Gary Fuller put West Coast Environmental in charge of obtaining a permit
for crossing the Kern River By-Pass channel from the Army Corp of
Engineers. As we discussed last week the application for the permit had not
been filed. Larry Campell with the environmental department has been asked
to contact West Coast Environmental for the status of the permit
application. I will provide the drawing, permit and permit requirements
when we receive them.

4) I will gather copies of the conditions and requirements from the water
districts and provide that to Alan.

5) We have not received the Fish and Games approval at this time. When we
receive it and have final approval from our environmental and legal
departments I will provide the Permit to Alan.

As you know we are at the States mercy on obtaining these permits. We are
shooting for the two week starting date as mention earlier. I will keep you
informed.

Matt,

In order for Ken Small Construction to plan and schedule the work in the
most economic manner we would like the following information in hand prior
to starting field construction work.

1) Copy of permit from Kern County Water Agency for the Cross Valley Canal
with the drawing that was submitted for permit application.

2) Copy of permit from Kern County for the Enos Lane crossing with drawing
that was submitted for permit application, also I need to get KSCI listed
as
contractor on permit.

3) Copy of permit from Caltrans for the I-5 crossing with drawing that was
submitted for permit application, also I need to get KSCI listed as rider
along with bore contractor.

4) Copy of permit from Army Corps of Engineers for the Kern River crossing
with drawing that was submitted for permit application, along with any
conditions required.

5) Copy of Fish & Game, Kern Water Bank Authority, Buena Vista Water
Storage
and West Kern Water requirements or conditions for construction of the
pipelines.

Your help in letting KSCI know the status of the above permits as soon as
possible will also help to set up a workable schedule that we can utilize
for our construction purposes.

Dear Market Participants,

With regard to the change shown below:
FERC ruled that the implementation of Locational Reserve Pricing must be
delayed for a period of 5 months.
The literal interpretation of that would indicate a April 8th deployment.
I can't say for sure that we have committed to that date specifically, but I 
can
say it won't take place before then.
The specifications of the eventual change may look quite different in 5 months
time.

Rich,

I have an idea. It is a little far fetched, but could potentially make
Enron 100MM in the first year so hear me out.

At the regional meeting this month, I was interested in the discussions
about the gas delivery's to the California border, and how the pipeline was
running at capacity. When I heard the potential of dollars that could be
made If we only had more capacity, I was shocked. This will hopefully be a
way to increase your MMBTU delivery without major expense. Someone might
have already looked at this, but if not, it might be worth the time.

Although the pipeline is full of MCF's it has room if you look at BTU's. I
received an analysis of the gas delivered to the border and found it was
running at 1015 BTU, with less than %.5 C3+. With the SoCal limit of C3+ at
%3, there is room to inject %2.5 C3+ and raise that BTU value.

The Idea is to use rail cars to transport Normal Butane (or any other NGL
that proves cost affective) to the California border, vaporize the liquid,
and inject the vapor into the pipeline up-stream of the custody meter to
SoCal Gas.

I know there is rail access in the area, so this should not be an issue. We
off-load the product, and vaporize it using heaters, or the more efficient
way is to use waste heat from a turbine engine. We then compress the vapor
and introduce it into the pipeline. My estimates are we can off-load up to
52 rail cars per day, vaporize the butane and compress the 50 MCF/day of
gas to pipeline pressure. This will raise the C3+ number to approximately
%2.75 just under the SoCal spec. The 52 rail cars of Butane will introduce
another 160,000 MMBTU per day but only raise your volume by 50MMCF, hardly
noticeable when you are at 2.2BCF. This idea will work at any facility
along the pipeline system that is a large delivery.

The C3+ that has the largest impact is Normal Butane due to is relatively
low cost and high BTU value. I am not sure what the Butane market is in
other areas, but we are selling Normal currently for .65c. /gal, and this
is abnormally high for California. The value of Normal Butane used in the
spreadsheet is .65c, the contract price currently used at the NCL plant.

I assumed .05c per gallon for operating cost. This number is conservative
as our operating cost at the NCL plant is .035c - .04c per gallon with full
fractionation. This number includes fuel necessary for vaporizing the
Butane, employees, etc. This operating cost number will drop dramatically
if we are able to use waste heat from a turbine. Most of the cost is fuel
necessary to run the heater.

The price used for sales gas is what I am not sure about. The price of
$8.50 /MMBTU is the number I have heard will hold for at least the next
year at the Cal. border, and possibly go up. No one knows if this is
sustainable for any length of time, but it is what I assumed for this
spreadsheet. (Notice the profit if you enter the gas value currently traded
at the Cal. border)

Take a look at the spreadsheet and hopefully it will clarify where I came
up with these numbers. All the BTU and MCF numbers for Normal Butane came
from the GPA Standard 2145 and all other numbers are my best guess. If you
find this an interesting idea, please forward to the appropriate people. I
would love to discuss it further so let me know what you think.

Rick

Dear Larry Campbell:

As a margin account holder, you know how important it is to receive 
information about your account in a quick and timely manner. One of 
the ways we notify customers about a margin call is with a letter, but 
unfortunately that letter often arrives too late for timely action. 
That's why we've decided to stop sending regular mail notification of 
margin calls to our customers. 

E-mail is the fastest way for us to notify you about a margin call. We 
will continue to provide you with speedy e-mail notification, and are 
committed to steadily improving our already top-rated e-mail service. 
Please check your inbox regularly and make sure that the e-mail 
address we have on file for your account is current. 

To update your e-mail address online, simply login to your account and 
select "Settings" from the Account Services pull-down menu. Then click 
"User Profile" and follow the directions to modify your e-mail address. 

We'd like to remind you of your responsibility to remain aware of the 
status of your margin account at all times, and to be prepared to take 
action as soon as conditions warrant. Be fully aware that if at any 
time your account value falls to approximately 10% equity, or if 
market conditions warrant, we reserve the right to close out some or 
all of your positions with or without notice, at our sole discretion. 
For these reasons it is imperative that you monitor your account on a 
regular basis. 

If you have any questions please send e-mail to support@datek.com or 
call Customer Support at 1-800-U2-DATEK. Please call 201-761-7500 if 
you are calling from outside of the United States.

Bill you may want to sit in on this if you have time.  It seems we have items 
of concern that were identified during the consolidated audit at Bakersfield 
which were tied into  a previous agreement with Koch for which the action 
team did not know when the action items were prepared.  The action dates are 
approaching and   Scott and I are having a hard time getting clearification 
on how to initiate getting the the action items started due to the 
responsibility of Koch for some of the items.  Ed, the attorney for EOTT,  
will be requested by Lou, to notify Koch concerning their responsiblity.  If 
this sounds convoluted, then you know as much as I.....

A phase I due diligence was completed for EOTT on two liquids pipeline 
segments in the Texas Panhandle and in Northwestern Colorado.  The assets are 
owned by Equilon Pipeline Company.  A copy of the findings have been 
submitted to Legal.  There were some deficiencies and potential liabilities 
discovered as a result of this activity.

Assisted the Roswell team in the preparation and completion of the 6 month 
and 12 Title V certification reports for the Roswell C/S.  No deficiencies or 
non compliance issues were identified for this 12 month period.

Annual certification reports were submitted to the TNRCC for 3 Transwestern 
and 8 Northern Natural Gas C/S in west Texas.  There wer no deficiencies or 
non compliance issues identified for any of the 11 facilities during this 12 
month period. 

The TNRCC reviewed the emissions testing report for the NNG Plains C/S and 
requested modification to the original report submitted.  The testing 
contractor was contacted and  a revised report was submitted to the agency.

John, we are working out some issues with the station 1 permit and the EPA=
=20
permits for 3 and 4.  Briefly here they are.

First issue, that we did not anticipate from the ADEQ.  It applies to hours=
=20
of operation for the generator.  The ADEQ has restricted hours of operation=
=20
because we are close to the PSD levels at the facility.  In talking to=20
Shdeish, the ADEQ protects itself and applies a 10% safety factor on all=20
applications that approach PSD to ensure that the PSD levels are not=20
triggered.   This is there policy not regulation.  What is ironic is that=
=20
they accepted our calculations for the netting, but did not indicate that=
=20
they would apply any safety factor for their comfort.  Im concerned about t=
he=20
time frame to iron out this issue and the construction start date.  I need=
=20
some guidance.  Do we want to spend time fighting this, not knowing how lon=
g=20
it will take to resolve or do we bite the bullet and put on a catlytic=20
converter for the generator and have unlimited operating hours?  In speakin=
g=20
with Shudeish, I got the impressions that when an application approaches th=
e=20
PSD limit, they want to see the applicant apply CEMS or some kind of contro=
l=20
technology just to be sure that they stay under the 250 ton limit.  I know=
=20
time is of the essence.

Second issue.  The EPA has given us a pretty good permit for stations 3 and=
=20
4, but have restircted us to ppmvd values for NOx and CO, instead of lb./hr=
=20
or ton/yr.  The values that they have given us in the permit are OK (25 ppm=
vd=20
for NOx and CO) at base load operation. GE will guarantee this.   However, =
at=20
lower tempertures and at reduced loads of 60%, the manufactures numbers are=
=20
40 ppmvd for NOx and CO.  We cant live with this.  In our application, we=
=20
stated that we would be operating at low loads for 20% of the time and we=
=20
applied a 15% safety factor for the higher NOx and CO levels and presented=
=20
this in lb.hr and tons/yr.  This would have covered us, but because the=20
permits limits are in ppmvd, we would exceed  these limits during low loads=
=20
and low temps.  I have requested from Roger that we would accept permit=20
conditions that would allow us 40 ppmvd during low temps and low loads with=
=20
with requiring us to do associated recordkeeping and Roger said that he wou=
ld=20
bring this before his management.  Ill keep you apprised of this issue.

The biennial hazardous waste reporting for 1999 for Transwestern Pipeline 
Company was submitted to the states of Texas, and New Mexico.

A meeting was held in Roswell to discuss air permitting activites and the 
recent agency inspection of the TW Atoka No. 3 C/S.  Due to the agenciy's 
portable testing of units at the AToka No. 2 and 3 C/S, A plan was developed 
to address potential actions which may result from the agency testing.  Also 
discussed was NSPS fuel gas monitoring for nitrogen and sulfur and other 
miscellaneous air issues.  

Texaco has initiated soil excavation of an abondoned pit which may be the 
source of groundwater contamination at the NNG Eunice C/S.  An Enron  
contractor is onsite to oversee the activities by Texaco and to assist in the 
results of the investigation.

The 3rd request to Region VI EPA was completed requesting approval of 5 
Transwestern and 1 NNG facilities for custom fuel monitoring schedules.  
Initial requests dating back to 10/8/98 were included with the packet.  A 
phone call to the Regional Administer of Region VI was also completed.  
Pending additional lack of response,   a meeting will be requested to the 
agency requesting action and approval of the requests.

Data requests from Argent Consulting have been distributed to the field for 
the 1999 emissions inventories.

Results of the additional archeological and biological survey's for the 
Gallup C/S power transmission line 7C application have been submitted to 
regualtory affairs in Omaha.  There were no positive concerns or impacts 
identified which would require additoinal actions.

The product recovery system was shut down on September 8th due to excessive 
production of water. This system was shut down pending the installation new 
recovery pumps which would minimize production of water. The new pumps have 
been purchased and are on-site, however, in the time period since September 
8th, PSH has accumulated in only one of the three on-site recovery wells. In 
light of this, installation of the new recovery pumps will be postponed until 
additional recovery wells have been installed.

Bob, James, Roger,

Im having a hard time getting a response from the teams in the Midland Region 
in completing the attached EOTT tank spreadsheet.  Ive heard from some of the 
teams but nothing from others.  Im under the gun as to finding  out where the 
MIdland Region is in term of permits and and environmental compliance and the 
only way I can begin to make the evaluation is to have the field data inputed 
onto the spreadsheet.  This is where the teams assistance is required.  I 
have attached the latest version of the spreadsheet in the hope that you will 
deliver it to the following teams for their valued input:

 Monahans Team
 Hamlin/Haskel Team
 Lamesa Team
 Big Lake Team
 Midland Team
 Eunice Team
  




Your assistance in this will be greatly appreciated.

Transwestern received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air 
Quality Bureau, for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1 
C/S which occurred in 1996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this 
issue in 1996 and assumed that the issue had been resolved, as no further 
actions were received from the agency until this Compliance Order was 
received. The issue in question was Transwestern's replacement of 
interchangeable internal components from a 4700 turbine into the existing 
smaller turbine (3505).  The larger internal components  (inlet guide 
vanes/nozzles) which were placed into the 3505 were mechanically derated to 
simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.  When Transwestern received 
permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine capacity, 
Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments and then operated at the higher 
turbine value 4700.  The AQB did not understand that Transwestern could not 
make the adjustments to the inlet guide vanes as any such activity by 
Transwestern would void the warranty with Soalr Mfg.  Only Solar is 
authorized to make adjustments to the turbine.  This prevents Transwestern 
from randomly and arbitrarily manipulating and adjusting horsepowers of this 
turbine at their descretion.

In the 1996 meeting with the AQB, Transwestern committed to conducting a 
emissions test of the 4700 to determine if emissions were more or less than 
the permitted values for the 3505.  It was shown that emissions from the 4700 
were less than that permitted by the AQB for the 3505.  It should also be 
mentioned that the 3505 was a regerative turbine and the 4700 is a simple 
cycle.   

  Apparently, EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to 
be outstanding as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the 
Compliance Order to review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern 
has 30 days to request another hearing. 

Id like to have a group discussion to decide how Transwestern will manage and 
handle this issue.  Would someone contact Anabelle and have her set up a 
conference call for sometime next week?

Joe, presented below is the first memo I sent out concering the air permit 
issue:

[Yesterday evening I phoned both the state of Arizona ( agency for stations 1 
and 2) and Region 9 EPA ( agency for stations 3 and 4) concerning the status 
of when the air permits would be issued by both agencies for the Redrock 
expansion.  I was surprised to find out that both agencies stated a 2-4 month 
delay prior to issuance.  They cited back log of other permits, public 
comment periods, and workload as being the main reasons.  I am particularily 
disappointed because there were pre meetings with both agencies identifying 
what was to be included in each application package, and even after the 
applications were submitted in March of this year, each agency came back and 
asked for different information that from what was discussed at each meeting.

I have a call into the state of Arizona ( construction is to begin at Station 
2 and they have jurisdiction for this station) to see if we can initiate  
some construction activities  such as laying pipe and building foundations 
prior to receiving the permit.  I have been given these types of approvals 
from other agencies in the past, but these types of approvals are extremely 
narrow and restrictive.   If this flys I am sure that they will require us to 
make sure the turbine is not brought on site until the permit has been 
issued.  I know this will require written approval from the agency, but this 
may allow us to proceed on schedule and avoid any delays.  Ill keep you 
apprised of this issue.]

I spoke with the ADEQ after our conference call and they directed me to 
another group (compliance) in the air permit section.  They strongly 
suggested that I contact the compliance group before contacting Nancy Wrona, 
Director of the ADEQ.  I left a message with the supervisor of the ADEQ 
compliance section, Kathy McConnell (?) 602-207-2328, but have not heard back 
from her.  Either Bill Kendrick or I will  be touching base with her again, 
tomorrow.

Arnold has given me the following list of construction items he would like to 
have the ADEQ grant us permission/waiver to do in leau of receiving the air 
permits:

 all earthwork
 trench construction and piping tie ins
 all foundation and building construction
 installation of ancillary equipment

This list is probably too aggressive and falls out of what the agency may 
allow us to do.

The EPA contact for the Sta. 3 and 4 air permits: permit engineer  Roger 
Cohn      (415) 744-1238
      Supervisor  Geraldo Rios    (415) 744-1259

The ADEQ contact for Sta. 1 and 2 air permit permit engineer  Shudeish 
Mahadev (?)   (602) 207-2323
      Director   Nancy Wrona

We are pleased to present you with a 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Award.
As a participant in this grant you have the opportunity to share in the
ownership of Enron and the potential profit from increases in the value of
Enron's common stock.

The 2001 Special Stock Option Grant was made to let you know how valuable
you are and to recognize your contributions in making Enron the great
company it is today.   Although there are no guarantees as to Enron's
future stock performance, we believe that an Enron stock option has
tremendous future growth potential.  The value you ultimately receive from
your options will depend on the price of Enron stock at the time you
exercise your options.

You can access your 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Agreement and the Stock
Plan document governing the grant via your eHRonline account on the
intranet website at http://ehronline.enron.com.  Unlike stock options
granted in the past a copy of your grant agreement will not be mailed to
your home address.

Additionally, the following information regarding the 2001 Special Stock
Option Grant can be found on the HR website http://hrweb.enron.com.

Larry,

I spoke with Debbie Flynn this afternoon to acquire June usage information
for our customers on ELZ.  She said that she has faxed and mailed this
information to you.  Can you please let us know asap if you have that
information?  We only have two days left this month to invoice the
customers and would greatly appreciate your assistance in helping us do so.

Thanks!

Dyaniese
