Got your voice mail.  My thoughts are the following:

1.  I always insist that there is a breakdown of accounts by lawyer name, 
hourly rate and task description.  If it is not in this account I do not know 
why and I think it is appropriate that you ask for it and receive it.

2.  I would have expected the account to be large and that there are a number 
of people involved.  I lost involvement (at the direction of Delainey and 
Milnthorp) early in this project after the initial crisis management stage, 
but my observations of the number of people and resources involved are the 
following:  

At the outset we needed a number of people to manage the search and related 
technical and legal issues in the short term.  Over the longer term, staffing 
requirements ought to be greatly reduced and it seems that since the original 
crisis management stage the file has been over staffed.  At the same time, in 
fairness, I believe Blakes feels that the are responding to the requirements 
of Enron to throw al ot of resources at the project.  If it has not already 
happened, I believe you should speak to Dan Fournier to confirm our 
expectations and to discuss rationalizing resources.  As I say, I was asked 
to step back from this project, but I am happy to have this discussion with 
Dan Fournier if you prefer.

Also, I did not receive a copy of the account, but it seems to me that at our 
direction Blakes hired a number of economic and political consultants which 
will also be greatly expensive and which will as I understand be billed to 
Blakes and included in Blakes accounts as disbursements to maintain 
privilege.  If it has not already happened, I also believe the use of the 
consultants also needs to be rationalized.

I also expect that VE will have a not insignificant account.

In summary, since the initial stage I have had limited involvement, but I am 
not surprised (and would have expected) that the account is large and I 
expect that larger accounts are coming once consultant accounts start to roll 
in.  I believe that detailed account breakdowns are appropriate but also that 
the use of all consultants including Blakes needs to be rationalized.  I also 
believe that Blakes has done an excellent job and that a lot was be asked of 
them in the early stages and therefore they were throwing a lot of resources 
to the project.

Lastly, in anticipation that this would be expensive and that there would be 
a number of people involved, Rob Milnthorp initially spoke to John Lavorato 
about setting up a separate Houston RC for the project which John agreed to.  
The RC number I gave you may have been a Canadian RC and I need to confirm 
with accounting.  In any event, I will be sending a subsequent e-mail to all 
internal groups to make sure that all expenses, internal and external, are 
billed to that separate RC.

Peter.

Please let me know if I can be of any help.

You may be interested to know that on July 20, 2000 the Alberta Minister of 
Resource Development signed the new Market Surveillance Amendment Regulation 
into law.   The new regulation made four changes to the existing Market 
Surveillance Regulation, namely:

(a) it gave the MSA the new authority to monitor the conduct of the PPA 
Owners in relation to compliance with their obligations under the PPAs;
(b) it gave complaintants a mechanism to appeal a decision of the MSA not to 
further investigate a complaint to the Power Pool Council;
(c) it retained the mandatory referral mechanism by the MSA to another agency 
if the MSA's investigation determines the matter falls within another 
agency's jurisdiction (i.e. Competition Bureau) but has eliminated the 
requirement that upon such a referral the MSA cease its own investigation.   
The Power Pool Council now has the authority to determine whether the MSA 
should carry on with its investigation after a referral, or not.
(d) it added a section relating to the MSA's authority to apply to the Court 
for an order authorizing it to take evidence outside of Alberta.

Attached is a copy of the Market Surveillance Amendment Regulation.

"Privileged and Confidential"

Please note: I have not sent this memo to GPC.   

1.  Meeting with Alberta Department of Resource Development

Rick Shapiro, Aleck Dadson, and I met with two senior officials from the 
Alberta Department of Resource Development last week (Larry Charach, 
Executive Director, Electricity  and Stan Wenger, Assistant Deputy Minister, 
Gas & Alberta Markets) and it is our view that the ADRD is not aware of 
Project Stanley based on some rather awkward questions we were asked by Larry 
Charach relating to our views on whether Powerex has complied with the spirit 
of the rules in Alberta. 

2. Meeting with TransAlta and Other Alberta Marketers

I attended a meeting of Alberta marketers last week hosted and organized by 
TransAlta's trading group.  TransAlta proposed the companies in attendance 
form a coalition whose mandate and objective would be to retain counsel (U.S. 
and Canadian) along with possibly other experts to assist the coalition in 
formulating a strategy designed to address concerns of the invited market 
participants with B.C. Hydro Power Supply, B.C.Hydro Grid Operations and 
Powerex's alleged improper use of the Network Economy Tariff provisions in 
the B.C. Hydro Wholesale Transmission Tariff.  

The attendees at the meeting included representatives from 4 of the 5 Alberta 
PPA Buyers, namely Enron, TransCanada Power, Engage Energy, and Enmax along 
with Atco Power, PanCanadian, Duke Energy, and Aquila.  In addition, although 
Bonneville Power Administration was not in attendance it was interesting that 
TransAlta advised that BPA  shared TransAlta's concerns and was interested in 
working with this group to address these concerns.  

At the meeting TransAlta walked the group through a specific example of a 
situation that occurred in May 2000 where TransAlta alleges that both it and 
TransCanada Power were blocked from using scheduled interruptible 
transmission capacity out of Alberta by B.C. Hydro Power Supply through its 
use of the Network Economy provisions in the B.C. Hydro Wholesale 
Transmission Tariff (which has a higher priority than interruptible 
transmission) during a period when prices were considerably higher in the 
Pacific Northwest than in Alberta.  As a result of the interruption of 
TransAlta's and TransCanada's interruptible transmission reservation, 
transmission capacity between Alberta/BC border and BC/US border became 
available and was immediately acquired by B.C. Hydro Power Supply and used to 
support Powerex exports during these periods into the U.S.    TransAlta 
estimates the opportunity cost  of this curtailment to TransAlta was $2 
million.

TransAlta's frustration is no surprise to Enron Canada.  I can advise that I 
wrote a memo to John Lavorato dated March 17, 2000 in which I reviewed 
Enron's concerns regarding the behavior of B.C. Hydro Power Supply  and 
Powerex that is very similar to the allegations presented by TransAlta.  The 
purpose of my memo to John L was to outline my initial thoughts on what Enron 
Canada may wish to do to attempt to stop this abuse and was focused on the 
idea of proceeding with a complaint to FERC that B.C. Hydro Power Supply and 
Powerex were exercising transmission market power.   Enron Canada did not 
pursue this any further at the time.

Among the ideas reviewed by TransAlta with the group to address and rectify 
the abuse it alleges exist on the transmission path between Alberta and the 
U.S. Pacific Northwest included: 
 i) a complaint to ADRD and a request they become involved;
 ii) a complaint to the Alberta Market Surveillance Administrator;
 iii) a complaint to FERC;
 iv) a complaint to the BCUC;
 v) a complaint to the B.C. Government;
 vi) a complaint to the NEB;
 vii) a complaint to the Competition Bureau; and/or
 viii) a NAFTA complaint.   

With respect to TransAlta's comments relating to the Competition Bureau, they 
advised the group that they have spoken to the Competition Bureau about their 
concerns and were told by the Competition Bureau that it is monitoring the 
Alberta electricity market.   Based on the description provided by TransAlta 
of its discussions with the Competition Bureau and other comments made by 
TransAlta at the meeting I do not believe TransAlta is aware of Project 
Stanley.    I believe the comments made by the TransAlta trader Enron's 
trader last month about the Competition Bureau were not about Project Stanley 
but were in the context of TransAlta complaining to the Competition Bureau 
about B.C. Hydro Power Supply and Powerex's alleged abuse of the Network 
Economy provisions in the Tariff.  

The next step in the coalition building process is a meeting on September 11, 
2000 of those companies that wish to proceed to form a coalition.  The idea 
is that the coalition members would work out the terms of confidentiality 
documentation prior to any member sharing historical information that it may 
wish to provide relating to potential abuses by B.C. Hydro Power Supply or 
Powerex.  In addition they intend to begin to consider which of the possible 
courses of action described above would be most effective.  It appears from 
the discussion at the initial meeting that the option that involves a 
complaint to FERC is the most favored by TransAlta at this time.  Finally, 
they intend to discuss a preliminary budget which TransAlta suggested may be 
in the range of $500,000 Cdn if the group elects to proceed with a complaint 
to FERC.

There are without question a number of reasons why a decision that Enron 
Canada should not even consider having any part of this coalition in view of 
the Project Stanley matter is the safest strategy.  Having said this, Enron 
Canada has a significant commercial interest in seeing this coalition (with 
or without Enron) achieve its objective to reduce or eliminate B.C. Hydro 
Power Supply's and Powerex's ability to use the Network Economy Service to 
block its competitors from access to import capacity into Alberta and export 
capacity into the U.S.   Enron Canada's recent acquisition of the Alberta 
Sundance B PPA (700 MW of capacity dispatch rights in Alberta) makes this 
issue even more commercially significant as the ability to contract for 
transmission capacity without the risk of a reasonable probability of 
curtailment as a result of B.C. Hydro Power Supply invoking Network Economy 
Service would represent a significant risk mitigant for Enron's Sundance B 
long position.   There is also some benefit of participating in the coalition 
to influence the direction it takes and to stay abreast of what it is doing.

I have discussed the matter with Rob Milnthorp and he agrees that the 
decision to participate in the coalition would obviously have to be 
considered and approved by those managing the Project Stanley issue.   If the 
decision of the Project Stanley team is that Enron Canada must steer clear of 
this coalition because of Project Stanley, then Rob M and other commercial 
guys in ENA who do business with Powerex will not need to give further 
consideration to additional reasons why Enron Canada may elect not 
participate such as: i) the implications on Enron Canada's and ENA's 
commercial relationship with Powerex, ii) whether Enron Canada  would be 
prepared to commit to anything more than attending the first meeting of the 
coalition with a view to understanding the nature of the confidentiality 
obligations, the favored course of action, and the budget,  iii) whether 
Enron Canada would explicitly reserve the right to withdraw from the 
coalition at any time, and iv) whether Enron would want to be in a coalition 
with BPA who I understand we believe may also be engaged in exercising 
transmission market power .  To complicate this further, Enron Canada is 
presently being sued by TransAlta over the interpretation of the wording in 
two swap transactions and Rob Milnthorp has indicated that Enron Canada will 
not agree to participate in any coalition with TransAlta unless and until 
TransAlta discontinues this lawsuit.  

I look forward to your comments and feedback on this issue.

Regards,

Rob

Priveleged and Confidential

The Alberta Department of Resource Development (ADRD) released a draft Market 
Surveillance Amendment Regulation today which contains proposed amendments to 
the current Market Surveillance Regulation that will be in force prior to the 
PPA Auction later this month.   A number of changes have been made in 
response to: (i) concerns raised by potential Power Purchase Arrangement 
Bidders about PPA Owners intentionally witholding capacity,  and (ii) other 
apparent deficiencies with the original MSA Regulation.  We may wish to use 
the opportunity to informally  advocate for a specific change to the MS 
Regulation (Enron Canada will be filing formal written comments on other 
unrelated issues) that would mitigate one of the risks of a negative outcome 
on Project Stanley.

I understand that Blakes has undertaken a review of the EUA or Market 
Surveillance Regulation to determine what sanctions could result from a 
negative outcome on Project Stanley and therefore they can confirm whether I 
have identified all the applicable sections of the EUA and Regulations that 
address this issue.  Based on my quick review I see a conflict between the 
Market Surveillance Regulation and the Power Pool Rules.

Section 15 of the current Market Surveillance Regulation provides the Power 
Pool Council with the authority to impose sanctions on market participants 
that are found to be in contravention of the Electric Utilities Act, the 
Regulations, the rules of the power pool, etc.  There are four specific 
sanctions including: (i) fine, (ii) imposition of terms and conditions on the 
market participants activitives, (iii) direction to the market participant 
not to engage in certain activity, and (iv) direction to the market 
participant to pay the costs of an investigation and hearing.  None of these 
specific sanction include suspension or revocation of a market participants 
Power Pool Registration.  

In contrast to Section 15 of the Market Surveillance Regulation, Section 
9(1)(d) of the EUA authorizes the Power Pool Council to change the rules of 
the Power Pool.  Rule 2.5.3 of the Power Pool Rules allows for the Power Pool 
Council to revoke a Participant's registration for having contravened the 
Power Pool Rules.  

I believe it is necessary to at least consider whether Enron Canada should 
call Sid Carlson (the ADRD Official responsible for the Market Surveillance 
Amendment Regulation) and verbally advocate for an amendment to the Market 
Surveillance Regulation that would serve to expressly remove any conflict 
between the MS Regulation and the Power Pool Rules in relation to the 
authority of the Power Pool Council to revoke a participants registration.  
An amendment that would limit the authority of the Power Pool Council to the 
four sanctions in the MS Regulation would have the postive effect of 
eliminating the risk of Enron Canada being suspended from the Power Pool (and 
therefore remove one of the risks inherent in Enron Canada's participation in 
the PPA Auction).    

Admittedly, there is also a risk that our raising the issue could backfire 
and result in the ADRD entrenching such authority of the Power Pool Council 
into the Regulation and therefore deprive Enron Canada of arguing (in the 
event of a negative result on Project Stanley) that the Power Pool Council 
does not have the authority to revoke Enron Canada's Participant 
registration.   Aleck advises that the IMO in Ontario has the authority to 
revoke the registration of a market participant and he is of the view that it 
is reasonable for the Power Pool Council in Alberta to have recourse to such 
a sanction.   I understand from Dalton McGrath that Blakes is of the view 
that there is a very low probability of Enron Canada being sanctioned by way 
of suspension or revocation of its Power Pool registration in the event of a 
negative outcome on Project Stanley.  

While I appreciate there are pros and cons to saying anything on this issue, 
the MS Regulation is not frequently amended and the prospect of there being 
another opportunity to influence its amendment in this regard prior to the 
resolution of Project Stanley is very remote.   It is for this reason that I 
raise the matter now as the ADRD has indicated it will accept comments only 
until 12:00 p.m. Wednesday July 12.  

Regards,

Rob

Competition Bureau Raided Enron, Powerex Offices, Paper Says
11/23/0 9:44 (New York)


     Toronto, Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Canada's Competition Bureau
raided offices at Powerex Corp. and the Canadian arm of Enron
Corp., alleging the companies conspired to raise electricity
prices, the Globe and Mail reported, citing officials from both
companies.
     The bureau obtained a search warrant in May, claiming the two
companies co-ordinated bids last year to drive up prices on
Alberta's central electricity exchange, the paper said. Both
Powerex and Enron Canada Corp. said charges haven't been laid, and
denied they had broken any laws.
     Competition Bureau officials didn't say whether the
investigation is continuing. Unnamed sources told the paper the
bureau ``is keeping an eye on'' electricity markets in British
Columbia, Alberta and Ontario as those provinces deregulate.
     On Nov. 16, Houston-based Enron, the world's biggest energy
trader, said it plans to sell a 15 percent stake in a key Indian
power project valued at $136 million.
     Powerex is the power-marketing subsidiary of the British
Columbia Hydro and Power Authority.

The offices of Enron Canada Corp. and Powerex Corp. were raided this year by 
the federal Competition Bureau, which was investigating suspected price 
fixing by the two companies. 
In a search warrant application last May, the bureau alleged that in the 
summer of 1999, Enron and Powerex co-ordinated bids to drive up the price of 
electricity on the Power Pool of Alberta, the province's central electricity 
exchange, Dow Jones reported. 
Both companies confirmed searches were carried out, but said no charges have 
been laid and denied breaking any laws.

Enron Canada, said the bureau has since returned all of Enron 's files. 
Mr. Thode added the bureau has called Enron only once with a question about 
the files. "It remains just allegations," he said. 
"We are confident that all of our activities have been in the rules of the 
Power Pool of Alberta and within applicable Canadian laws." 
Both he and Wayne Cousins, a spokesman for Powerex, the trading arm of 
British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority,said they didn't know if their 
companies are still being investigated. 
"Powerex is confident that the bureau's investigation will find that the 
company has not violated the rules of the Alberta Power Pool," Mr. Cousins 
said. 
A spokesman from the Competition Bureau was not immediately available to 
confirm whether the investigation is continuing, but sources close to the 
bureau said it has been keeping an eye on the electricity markets in British 
Columbia, Alberta and Ontario as those provinces deregulate. 
While most of the bureau's monitoring has been in the form of advice, the 
regulator has taken steps for more direct intervention, sources said. 
Deregulation of the electricity market is still new and the market is not 
established, giving companies in the sector ample opportunity to play with 
the system, sources said. 
According to the search warrant, the bureau began investigating the two 
companies when Power Pool of Alberta system controllers noticed the price for 
a megawatt of electricity frequently rose above $100. 
In the Alberta system, participants submit bids to buy or sell power for the 
following day, and the price per megawatt of power is set by the most 
expensive unit needed to meet demand. 
Until the Power Pool changed its rules on Oct. 20, 1999, a participant could 
change the amount of power it bid or offered up until 20 minutes before the 
hour of transmission. The search warrant covers the companies' actions from 
June 1, 1999, to Oct. 19, 1999. 
Mr. Thode said investigations of this nature are common in deregulating 
markets. 
"It's happened in California this year, it's happened in the Midwest, it's 
happened around the globe. It's not unusual to see this type of investigation 
occur," he said. 
He added the Power Pool is required to call in the federal agency whenever 
there are allegations.

Status Report re: tape transcripts

At this time, this summary has been sent to you only.

Counsel for Powerex has indicated that he now has instructions to share with 
us the information that has been seized from their offices by the Bureau in 
exchange for our providing similar information to them.

He has also indicated to us that between the 19th and the 25th of October, 
the Bureau came to Vancouver and listened to the Powerex tapes using Powerex 
equipment in that they had been unable to listen to them with their own 
equipment.

As you are aware, the tapes seized from the Enron offices in Calgary cover 
the period of September of 1999 to the end of October.

The tapes which we have listened to, but which they have not seized, cover 
the period commencing in late May of 1999 to September, 1999.

With respect to the tapes that they have seized, initially we exerted a claim 
of privilege to all of the tapes.  The Bureau has now come back to us and has 
asked us to clarify how we would propose resolving the privilege question.  
We have volunteered to have this discussion with them, but to this point in 
time, they have not responded to us.

If, as and when the conversation occurs, our position will be that we intend 
to claim privilege with respect to conversations with lawyers only.  How this 
particular aspect of the matter would be resolved is not as yet clear.

Our view is that with respect to the conversations they have, they are not 
particularly damaging but the conversations do not particularly add to the 
flavour of the matter to our benefit.

On Wednesday of next week, we will be meeting with counsel for Powerex to see 
exactly which conversations they have delivered to the Bureau.  We will 
advise him of the conversations that have been taken by the Bureau from our 
offices and at the conclusion of this matter, we should be able to see 
exactly what it is that the Bureau has in terms of conversations between 
Powerex and Enron.

We look forward to discussing this matter with you at your convenience.

With respect to Rob Hemstock's email of August 31st, and Richard Sanders and 
Glenn Leslie's comments of this morning, it would appear that the coalition 
being discussed could have a major benefit to Enron and in the normal course 
of events would be something that Enron would participate in.

Having said this, Rob Hemstock's comment that the safest course of action is 
not to participate is accurate.

In the event that Enron determines to proceed with the coalition, 
notwithstanding Project Stanley, it is my view that a low key role with the 
right to withdraw from the coalition at any time may be the appropriate way 
to go given that as Project Stanley proceeds, we are going to have to work 
hand in hand with Powerex from time to time.

In my view this is something that we should consider further in the next few 
days

The release of the Market Surveillance Administrator's  "status report" on 
the Alberta electricity market has been delayed until tomorrow morning.  I 
spoke to the Chairman of the Power Pool, Lorry Wilson, today about the Market 
Surveillance Administrator's report and he advised me:

i) the Report was not prompted by one or more MSA investigations;
ii) the Report is silent on the trading activities of any specific market 
participant;
iii) it will contain 10 recommendations focused on "how to improve the 
marketplace" and changes in rules/processes currently followed by the Power 
Pool, the Transmission Administrator, the Market Surveillance Administrator, 
and the Alberta Department of Resource Development.  
iv) the Report was prompted by concerns expressed by stakeholders that prices 
in the Alberta electricity market do not represent prices that are the 
product of a fair and efficient market;
v)  this Report will be the first in a new reporting process that will see 
the MSA release on a quarterly, and perhaps monthly, basis going forward.  It 
is more comprehensive than the future reports will be.  The Power Pool's 
preference was to start this process in January 2001 but given iii) they felt 
they had to release something sooner.

Lorry is aware of Project Stanley.  His comments to me during our discussion 
appeared to be intended to assure me that I need not be overly concerned with 
the report.  In fact, he indicated that he looks forward to discussing the 
contents and receiving Enron's input on the observations and recommendations 
in it.  

I will forward the report to you once it is released tomorrow.

Regards,

Rob

Personal and Confidential
Privileged Solicitor and Client Communication

As many of you know, I met with Chris Calger yesterday in Portland.  I
will be preparing a memorandum of my conversation with Chris which I
will ask him to review for distribution.  In summary, Chris was frank
and open, and in my view, expressed genuine corporate concern with the
investigation.  I believe that my notes will indicate that Chris did not
have direct contact with PowerX in connection with any particular trade
during the period being investigated by the government.  Although, in my
view, Chris had general knowledge of Enron*s approach taken in
connection with bidding power into the pool, he did not see himself as
spearheading or orchestrating that process.  I hope to prepare my memo
today for review by Chris later in the day.

PowerX has retained the law firm of Lawson Lundell in Vancouver to
represent their interest.  The lawyer is Chris Sanderson who is a senior
member of the B.C. and Alberta Bars.  His practice focuses on regulatory
law and civil litigation, particularly in the energy industry.

I spoke to Chris Sanderson today to introduce myself and to give him a
very general background on the investigation conducted at the Calgary
office.  He reported that a similar investigation had taken place in the
PowerX office in Vancouver.  Their investigation started at the same
time as ours and ended on Thursday of last week.

Chris Sanderson did confirm that there are tapes of conversations with
Enron involving these various trades.  As a result, I suspect that these
tapes ought to contain the same dialogue that is contained on our tapes.
 I did not get into any discussion as to the information that may be
contained on the tapes and exactly what information had been seized by
the government.  I did get the impression, however, that the government
has taken possession of tapes from PowerX.

He indicated that in his preliminary view the documents themselves are
not the concern but the tapes are.  Again, I did not discuss any
particular matter with respect to the tapes only that Enron did keep
taped conversations of trades undertaken by its traders.

I think it would be worthwhile, and he agreed, if Glenn Leslie and I,
and perhaps Web, met with Chris at the appropriate time.  He is open to
entertain a dialogue between counsel subject of course to matters of
privilege and commonality of interest.

He indicated that he wants to take approximately two weeks to review the
evidence obtained by the investigators (he has not done so yet and
preferred having a firm knowledge of the information seized by the
government before talking to us) and thereafter, initiate a dialogue
with us to see what information might be worth sharing.

I will have Glenn Leslie give him a call to try to set a date when we
might meet with him.  We might want to discuss briefly during our
telephone conference on Friday our approach to meeting with Lawson
Lundell and what would be our ultimate objectives in doing so.

Yesterday, I talked to Cliff O*Brien, the counsel retained for John
Lavorato, and tried to give him a very brief overview of the issues.
Unfortunately, I was at the Portland airport when I did talk to him and
had to keep my conversation somewhat cryptic.  Cliff did meet with John
Lavorato for approximately two hours last night.  Cliff called me this
morning and would like to meet with me.  I will meet him at 4:00 today.
Cliff indicated that the matter was more complex than he had imagined
and expressed a view that in John*s opinion these were simple trades and
nothing else.  I will report to you further on this after I have had a
chance to meet with Cliff O*Brien.

If any of you have any questions, please don*t hesitate to call.  In any
event, we will be talking at our regularly scheduled conference call
Friday at 10:30 (central time).

Regards,

Dan

"Privileged and Confidential"

I read your message regarding the meeting with TransAlta and other Alberta 
marketers with interest.  My immediate thoughts are as follows.

Obviously, you should keep the discussions entirely to problems experienced 
with B.C. Hydro/Powerex foreclosure of transmission capacity.

If the project proceeds, the coalititon should appoint a limited number of 
people to carry the project and report back to participants.

The working group should ensure that their proceedings include outside 
counsel who had or have some knowledge of antitrust, as well as the 
regulatory issues.

The coalition should stay as close as possible to government.  For example, 
they should try to involve Alberta officials in the project if possible.

My guess is the Competition Bureau will take the view that regulatorys (B.C., 
NEB, FERC) have primary jurisdiction, but the Bureau may be an ally in 
dealing with regulators.  Do you know who at the Bureau TransAlta talked to 
about their concerns?  This may also have some bearing on the extent to which 
Enron should openly participate in the project.

Subject: Project Stanley - History of the Design of the Alberta Power Pool 
Model

I understand your call to me yesterday was to inquire about the vision the 
architects of the Power Pool of Alberta had when they were setting up the 
Power Pool, and more particularly, whether they envisioned that 
unsophisticated Pool Participant would be expected to obtain assistance from 
other more sophisticated Pool Participants to maximize the price that it 
would receive from the Power Pool for the energy it sold into the Power 
Pool.    I have reviewed the some materials (i.e. AEUB Decisions, Alberta 
Department of Energy documents) and have found nothing related to this.  This 
is not surprising as these market design issues were considered in Alberta in 
1994 and 1995, long before I arrived on the electricity scene in 1997.

I did speak to a consultant who was involved in the market design process in 
the early 1990's named Jim Fitzowich.  Jim joined TransAlta in 1986 and then 
worked for TransCanada Power until January 2000 when he established his 
current consulting practice.  Jim became a member of the Power Pool Council 
in late 1995 and stayed in that position until May 1998 when an independent 
Power Pool Council was appointed.  Jim and I are both on the Board of 
Directors of the Independent Power Producers Society of Alberta and I know 
Jim fairly well.  

Jim advised that the Alberta electricity industry design was quarterbacked by 
the Deputy Minister of Energy of the day named Rick Hyndman.  Under Rick 
Hyndman's direction a White Paper was apparently released in October 1994 in 
which a power exchange regime modelled on the exchange regime in the U.K. was 
thoroughly discussed and proposed for Alberta.   According to Jim Fitzowich, 
this White Paper was the initial blueprint for the Alberta market design.  I 
have met Rick Hyndman a few times and understand he left government a few 
years ago and is also a consultant.  I left Rick a message to call me and I 
intend to ask him to send me a copy of the White Paper and also inquire about 
the nature of his consulting work.  

On a related note, attached is an email I sent to Bill G and John L in March 
2000 advising them of the new Power Pool Participant Behavior Guidelines that 
were added to the Power Pool Rules in March 2000.  You can see the original 
notice of the rule change received from the Power Pool is also attached as 
are the actual Participant Behavior Guidelines (see Change 11a).  While I 
appreciate the determination of whether an offence occurred under the 
Competition Act would be independent of the compliance, or not, with the 
Power Pool Rules, I think it is noteworthy that the Power Pool incorporated 
these entirely new set of Participant Behavior Guidelines only recently, and 
after the acts that are the subject of Project Stanley had occurred.     

You should also be aware that there is a document on the Power Pool website 
(http://www.powerpool.ab.ca/index_links.html) entitled "Summary of Power Pool 
Rule Changes" that appears to list all the rule changes that have occurred 
since the Power Pool began operation in 1996.   

Regards,

Rob

Subject: Alberta Power Pool Rule Changes

Attached are a number of Pool Rule Changes that I expect will be approved 
today by the Power Pool Council.  The most noteworthy change is the addition 
of the new Rule 2.9 - "Participant Behavior Guidelines".

The Participant Behavior Guidelines contain very broad language but are 
intended to provide market participants with guidance from the Pool on the 
types of activities that it considers to constitute anti-competitive 
behavior.    It identifies three categories of "undesireable practices" 
namely: (a) sharing of competitive information, (b) abuse of dominant 
position (which includes physical or economic witholding of facilities or 
energy so as to adversely impact upon the efficient, fair, and openly 
competitive operation of the market), and (c) other practices including 
conduct that would cause a material change in price.

In my view, this new Rule does not extend any additional powers to the Power 
Pool or the Market Survelliance Administrator beyond the already broad 
authority given to the MSA in Section 9.1 of the Electric Utilities Act.  It 
is my sense from conversations I had with stakeholders at the IPPSA 
Conference that the Power Pool's motivation behind this new Rule was to send 
a message to Powerex and the PPA Owners that the Power Pool is concerned 
about their market power and is/will be monitoring them.   We need to be 
aware of these rules so we can mitigate the risk of our business not being 
conducted within them.  

It may be worthwhile for Peter and I to consolidate the relevant EUA 
provisions and the Pool Rules into one reference resource for the commercial 
group.   

Regards,

Rob

Matt,

Subject to the views of Jim Studdert and David Best, given that we already 
put underwriters on notice that there was contamination, and given that we 
have worked closely with Minton's, underwriters' representatives, I would 
assume that we are under no time pressure to give underwriters a  total 
quantum before the joint survey  takes place; in fact, it looks like the 
final determination of ECT's total quantum of damages may be impacted by the 
results of the joint survey (although I would not necessarily want to say 
that to underwriters at this point).  

My preliminary review of the policy reflects no language in the policy which 
would require ECT to immediately provide a total quantum. The policy 
specifically requires, under "INSTRUCTIONS IN CASE OF LOSS", that ECT file a 
claim in writing against the "delivering carrier holding him responsible as 
soon as loss or damage is discovered even though the full exent thereof is 
not apparent; details can be furnished later.  Such action will not prejudice 
your insurance claim."  Let me know if you would like a copy of the pertinent 
policy; I have already sent a copy to David.  

I do have some strategy questions for David about the disposition of the 
cargo currently in Thailand and will give him a call tomorrow morning at 9:00 
a.m. Houston time to discuss.  Although I know that is quite late for you, 
you are more than welcome to participate (just e-mail me a telephone number 
at which you can be reached, or give me a call at that time).

   Regards,
   Britt

Britt

With reference to Cliff Bennett's note, do you know whether our cargo 
underwriters require notice of the amount of our potential claim? As you 
know, previous figures were very rough estimates and only considered the 
rejected cargo and associated freight and demurrage. We have not computed the 
costs of the Thai cargo loss (if any) and the various testing and analyses 
costs.

Matt

PRIVILEGED; CONFIDENTIAL; ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT

FYI - Please see below Cliff Bennett's recommendations for joint testing.

I spoke briefly with Rich Slovenski regarding the Elang presently stored in 
Thailand. He confirms that the intention was to deliver it to First Gas some 
time end August/early September premised on delivery and acceptance of the 
first Elang cargo and subject to First Gas's consumption.

Cargo still not sold. Rich is not immediately able to calculate loss on the 
cargo basis First Gas Price vs resale price, but will be giving it 
somethought to arrive at an estimate.

The test results we have to date of the Thai cargo are somewhat inconclusive, 
but indicate Lead and Vanadium may be off spec, but principal reason for not 
delivering to First Gas is uncertainty of D3605 as a test method.

Summary of Thailand samples test results:

6 July 2000 - Ship Composite sample taken before discharge in Thailand was 
tested by SGS Thailand for Carbon Residue 10% and Filterable Dirt. Filterable 
Dirt was off spec at 6.3; Carbon Residue 10% was off spec at 1.5. SGS 
Thailand suggested that the  Carbon Residue 10% result was questionable and 
recommended retesting. There were however, no other ship composite samples 
taken before discharge in Thailand. Shoretank samples tested by SGS Thailand  
for Carbon Residue 10% and Filterable Dirt on the same date were on spec.

12 July 2000 -  Thailand shoretank samples brought to SGS Singapore tested on 
spec except for Lead which tested off spec at 0.3 (T-961) and 0.2 (T-964). 
"Ashing" test used for metals.

13 July  2000 - Thailnd shoretank samples brought to Caleb Brett Singapore 
tested on spec, but note different test method used (D5184/5185).

14 July 2000 - Thailand shoretank samples re-tested for metals by SGS 
Singapore:

Direct D3605
Vanadium off spec at 0.9 (T-964)
Lead off spec at 0.8 (T-961); 1 (T-964)
Vanadium + Lead off spec at 1.2 (T-961); 1.9 (T-964)

"Ashing"
Lead off spec at 0.3 (T-964)

Matt

Subject: Re: Pacific Virgo - Elang Crude - Samples for Testing


Matthias,

As per my e-mail dd. 3rd August to Eric, from cargo Interests viewpoint it
is usually best in these circumstances to keep as many analytical options
open as possible. Certainly sufficient to enable the best chance of
establishing the cause. To that end, I would recommend that you provide the
other Parties with the test methods (ASTM D-numbers) and state that these
tests will be applied to retain samples from each of:

1. Pacific Virgo before & after loading, Australia (all cargo)
2. Pacific Virgo before discharge, Thailand (Batangas-nominated tanks, if
samples available)
3. Pacific Virgo before discharge, Thailand (Thai-nominated tanks)
4. Pacific Virgo on arrival Batangas (the samples upon which First Gas based
their rejection)
5. Pacific Virgo prior departure from Batangas (including bottom samples)
6. Pacific Virgo prior discharge Korea (including bottom samples)
7. Pacific Virgo, any other samples that are available and that might
progress the investigation


Some testing may involve composites, some individual samples. This will to a
degree depend on the lab's ability to get any particulates into homogeneous
suspension and keep them there long enough to make a composite. If that
can't be done, it will have to be individuals.

Insofar as identifying the particulates, should this prove necessary, I
think we need to keep all options open. While it is always possible to
perform unilateral analysis should disagreements arise, better to keep the
Parties together if possible. But not at the expense of limiting the
analysis' ability to determine cause.

I apologise if this all seems a bit woolly. But if you limit at the
beginning the potential extent of testing that might be necessary, it can
all prove meaningless.

I appreciate that testing cost plays a role in all of this. It is in
no-one's interest to do testing just for the sake of it and, as far as I am
concerned, that is not on my agenda nor, I am sure, is it on Enron's. But we
must be realistic. Depending upon the size of your potential claim (have
Underwriters been put on notice yet, by the way?), it might be worth
spending several $K to get to the root of the matter, rather than less to
learn nothing.

Best regards.

Absent Milnthorp's concern, I believe we should participate in coalitions and 
issues that make business sense as this one appears to- While we need to be 
cognizant of Stanley, it should be business as usual... so I would 
participate if that were the decision we would make absent Stanley..... We 
did nothing wrong in Stanley and this is an issue, i.e; B.C. Hydro/powerex 
transmission market power that needs to be remedied. I would also ask 
Milnthorp to reconsider his objection to participating while we're in 
litigation - I think on issues like this where we have common ground that are 
unrelated to the litigation, we need to rise above it and work to achieve the 
common objective. Thanks.

Subject: Project Stanley - Recent Meetings with Alberta Government and 
TransAlta

"Privileged and Confidential"

Please note: I have not sent this memo to GPC.   

1.  Meeting with Alberta Department of Resource Development

Rick Shapiro, Aleck Dadson, and I met with two senior officials from the 
Alberta Department of Resource Development last week (Larry Charach, 
Executive Director, Electricity  and Stan Wenger, Assistant Deputy Minister, 
Gas & Alberta Markets) and it is our view that the ADRD is not aware of 
Project Stanley based on some rather awkward questions we were asked by Larry 
Charach relating to our views on whether Powerex has complied with the spirit 
of the rules in Alberta. 

2. Meeting with TransAlta and Other Alberta Marketers

I attended a meeting of Alberta marketers last week hosted and organized by 
TransAlta's trading group.  TransAlta proposed the companies in attendance 
form a coalition whose mandate and objective would be to retain counsel (U.S. 
and Canadian) along with possibly other experts to assist the coalition in 
formulating a strategy designed to address concerns of the invited market 
participants with B.C. Hydro Power Supply, B.C.Hydro Grid Operations and 
Powerex's alleged improper use of the Network Economy Tariff provisions in 
the B.C. Hydro Wholesale Transmission Tariff.  

The attendees at the meeting included representatives from 4 of the 5 Alberta 
PPA Buyers, namely Enron, TransCanada Power, Engage Energy, and Enmax along 
with Atco Power, PanCanadian, Duke Energy, and Aquila.  In addition, although 
Bonneville Power Administration was not in attendance it was interesting that 
TransAlta advised that BPA  shared TransAlta's concerns and was interested in 
working with this group to address these concerns.  

At the meeting TransAlta walked the group through a specific example of a 
situation that occurred in May 2000 where TransAlta alleges that both it and 
TransCanada Power were blocked from using scheduled interruptible 
transmission capacity out of Alberta by B.C. Hydro Power Supply through its 
use of the Network Economy provisions in the B.C. Hydro Wholesale 
Transmission Tariff (which has a higher priority than interruptible 
transmission) during a period when prices were considerably higher in the 
Pacific Northwest than in Alberta.  As a result of the interruption of 
TransAlta's and TransCanada's interruptible transmission reservation, 
transmission capacity between Alberta/BC border and BC/US border became 
available and was immediately acquired by B.C. Hydro Power Supply and used to 
support Powerex exports during these periods into the U.S.    TransAlta 
estimates the opportunity cost  of this curtailment to TransAlta was $2 
million.

TransAlta's frustration is no surprise to Enron Canada.  I can advise that I 
wrote a memo to John Lavorato dated March 17, 2000 in which I reviewed 
Enron's concerns regarding the behavior of B.C. Hydro Power Supply  and 
Powerex that is very similar to the allegations presented by TransAlta.  The 
purpose of my memo to John L was to outline my initial thoughts on what Enron 
Canada may wish to do to attempt to stop this abuse and was focused on the 
idea of proceeding with a complaint to FERC that B.C. Hydro Power Supply and 
Powerex were exercising transmission market power.   Enron Canada did not 
pursue this any further at the time.

Among the ideas reviewed by TransAlta with the group to address and rectify 
the abuse it alleges exist on the transmission path between Alberta and the 
U.S. Pacific Northwest included: 
 i) a complaint to ADRD and a request they become involved;
 ii) a complaint to the Alberta Market Surveillance Administrator;
 iii) a complaint to FERC;
 iv) a complaint to the BCUC;
 v) a complaint to the B.C. Government;
 vi) a complaint to the NEB;
 vii) a complaint to the Competition Bureau; and/or
 viii) a NAFTA complaint.   

With respect to TransAlta's comments relating to the Competition Bureau, they 
advised the group that they have spoken to the Competition Bureau about their 
concerns and were told by the Competition Bureau that it is monitoring the 
Alberta electricity market.   Based on the description provided by TransAlta 
of its discussions with the Competition Bureau and other comments made by 
TransAlta at the meeting I do not believe TransAlta is aware of Project 
Stanley.    I believe the comments made by the TransAlta trader Enron's 
trader last month about the Competition Bureau were not about Project Stanley 
but were in the context of TransAlta complaining to the Competition Bureau 
about B.C. Hydro Power Supply and Powerex's alleged abuse of the Network 
Economy provisions in the Tariff.  

The next step in the coalition building process is a meeting on September 11, 
2000 of those companies that wish to proceed to form a coalition.  The idea 
is that the coalition members would work out the terms of confidentiality 
documentation prior to any member sharing historical information that it may 
wish to provide relating to potential abuses by B.C. Hydro Power Supply or 
Powerex.  In addition they intend to begin to consider which of the possible 
courses of action described above would be most effective.  It appears from 
the discussion at the initial meeting that the option that involves a 
complaint to FERC is the most favored by TransAlta at this time.  Finally, 
they intend to discuss a preliminary budget which TransAlta suggested may be 
in the range of $500,000 Cdn if the group elects to proceed with a complaint 
to FERC.

There are without question a number of reasons why a decision that Enron 
Canada should not even consider having any part of this coalition in view of 
the Project Stanley matter is the safest strategy.  Having said this, Enron 
Canada has a significant commercial interest in seeing this coalition (with 
or without Enron) achieve its objective to reduce or eliminate B.C. Hydro 
Power Supply's and Powerex's ability to use the Network Economy Service to 
block its competitors from access to import capacity into Alberta and export 
capacity into the U.S.   Enron Canada's recent acquisition of the Alberta 
Sundance B PPA (700 MW of capacity dispatch rights in Alberta) makes this 
issue even more commercially significant as the ability to contract for 
transmission capacity without the risk of a reasonable probability of 
curtailment as a result of B.C. Hydro Power Supply invoking Network Economy 
Service would represent a significant risk mitigant for Enron's Sundance B 
long position.   There is also some benefit of participating in the coalition 
to influence the direction it takes and to stay abreast of what it is doing.

I have discussed the matter with Rob Milnthorp and he agrees that the 
decision to participate in the coalition would obviously have to be 
considered and approved by those managing the Project Stanley issue.   If the 
decision of the Project Stanley team is that Enron Canada must steer clear of 
this coalition because of Project Stanley, then Rob M and other commercial 
guys in ENA who do business with Powerex will not need to give further 
consideration to additional reasons why Enron Canada may elect not 
participate such as: i) the implications on Enron Canada's and ENA's 
commercial relationship with Powerex, ii) whether Enron Canada  would be 
prepared to commit to anything more than attending the first meeting of the 
coalition with a view to understanding the nature of the confidentiality 
obligations, the favored course of action, and the budget,  iii) whether 
Enron Canada would explicitly reserve the right to withdraw from the 
coalition at any time, and iv) whether Enron would want to be in a coalition 
with BPA who I understand we believe may also be engaged in exercising 
transmission market power .  To complicate this further, Enron Canada is 
presently being sued by TransAlta over the interpretation of the wording in 
two swap transactions and Rob Milnthorp has indicated that Enron Canada will 
not agree to participate in any coalition with TransAlta unless and until 
TransAlta discontinues this lawsuit.  

I look forward to your comments and feedback on this issue.

Regards,

Rob

You should be aware that I was advised yesterday by Larry Charach of the 
Alberta Department of Resource Development that the Market Surveillance 
Administrator has prepared a "status report" on the Alberta electricity 
market which will be made public on Monday.   The Minister also disclosed the 
existence of the MSA Report during a speech yesterday and said: "As Minister 
of Resource Development, I will be taking a very close look at the MSA's 
Report when it is delivered in the      coming days".   Larry Charach told me 
that he doesn't know what the report will say or conclude but did say that he 
expects the report is "likely to raise some controversy".   I will circulate 
a copy of the report once I receive it.

=DJ Enron, Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing
11/21/0 15:31 (New York)



      By Cheryl Devoe Kim
      Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  TORONTO (Dow Jones)--Canada's Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron
Canada Corp. in Calgary and Powerex Corp. in Vancouver earlier this year as
part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two
companies, according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires.
  Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he
used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of 1999, Powerex and
Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received
for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta.
  The investigation hasn't yet produced any charges against either of the
companies, according to Enron. The Competition Bureau declined to comment on
the status of the case.
  Both Enron Corp. (ENE), which owns Enron Canada, and Powerex, a unit of
provincially owned British Columbia Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), deny
breaking any rules or laws.
  From Powerex's point of view, Albertans are looking for someone to blame for
high power prices, which have become a political issue in the province.
  "They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market
design flaws," Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow
Jones Newswires in an interview.
   Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame
  The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every 
deregulating
market Enron has participated in, Enron Corp. spokesman Mark Palmer said.
  "Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even
oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility,
there have been investigations done," Palmer said.
  Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets
investigations, he said, but never found to be breaking the rules. This is the
first such investigation into Powerex's actions, Peterson said.
  The Competition Bureau, based in Ottawa, won't say whether the investigaion
is ongoing, citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act.
  The companies themselves said they're not sure of the investigation's 
status.
Their seized files were returned several months ago, but Powerex hasn't heard
from the Bureau since then. Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week
with a question, according to Enron Corp. spokesman Eric Thode.
  The investigation began when the Power Pool of Alberta's system controllers
noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C$100 
with
unusual frequency.
  The Pool's price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power
for the following day. Until Oct. 19, 1999, a bidder could restate the amount
of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times, until 20 minutes
before the hour of transmission. The price paid for every megawatt of power
needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to
meet demand.
   Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed
  According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application, Powerex and
Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner:
  Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer. As little as two 
minutes
later, Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume,
but at a "significantly higher price," according to the warrant application.
Sometimes, Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its
offer.
  Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig, who once worked in Enron Canada's gas
trading group, found that "as a result of restatements, involving mostly
Powerex and Enron," the Pool price was raised once to C$200/MWh, four times to
between C$354.29 and C$499.93, three times to between C$500 and C$541.63, and
10 times to between C$801.02 and C$998.
  Based on the restatement patterns, Craig, and then the Bureau's Bloom,
concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool. They believed the
power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the
higher price, according to the warrant application. By cutting the volume
offered by Powerex, the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be
needed, and every participant would get the higher price.
  Powerex's Peterson doesn't take issue with the trade history as detailed by
the Bureau, but denies that the company's traders were doing anything wrong or
that the two companies had some sort of arrangement.
  "And we're adamant about that," Peterson said. "There was no deal with 
Enron.
There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a
change in prices or anything like that."
  Powerex traders were merely locking in their price, cutting the company's
risk, which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price,
Peterson said.
  "Whenever Enron's offer of high-priced energy was declined, within moments 
of
Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required,
Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced
unit," according to the warrant application.
  Peterson's response: "We're operating in a very tight market there and we
felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta."
  Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws.
  "It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we
could sell it at," Enron's Thode said. "And that's what Enron and every other
company does that's in the business of trading."
  The May 25 search warrant covers the companies' actions between June 1, 
1999,
and Oct. 19, 1999. On Oct. 20, 1999, the Pool changed its restatement rules,
essentially closing the loophole, though it did so without ever making public
its investigation into Powerex and Enron.
  Power Pool spokesman Wayne St. Amour declined to discuss details of the
investigation.
  "Market surveillance is in place to, among other things, protect the
interests and activities of market participants," he said.
  Those convicted under Canadian law for bid-rigging can be fined an amount at
the court's discretion and/or jailed up to five years. A conviction wouldn't
likely affect Powerex's ability to trade in the U.S., Peterson said. In Canada
"there would have to have some follow-on action by the Alberta parties to
inhibit that. And so far, they still like to get our power."
  Companies Concerned About Reputations
  The bigger problem, Peterson said, is what the case will do to the Powerex
reputation.
  "Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at
stake from a reputational point of view," Peterson said. "Both companies, I
believe, conduct themselves in the highest possible standard. But these are
difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and
California and people looking for somebody to blame. There's always a
possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved."
  Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of
Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia,
linking Washington with Alberta, as detailed in an Oct. 13 Power Pool market
surveillance report. Again, no charges have been laid.

Privileged and Confidential 

As requested, attached are copies of selected correspondence prepared by 
Enron Canada to either the Alberta Government or the Power Pool of Alberta 
addressing various Alberta electricity restructuring issues that may directly 
or indirectly relate to Project Stanley.   Also attached are the speaking 
notes that I relied on during two panel discussions that I participated in at 
conferences on Alberta electricity restructuring earlier this year.   These 
speaking notes reflect the messages that Enron Canada has communicated in 
many different forums in Alberta on the PPAs and other electricity 
restructuring issues.    

I have organized the documents into groups as some of the documents may not 
be relevant to the work being undertaken by both GPC and Blake Cassels and 
therefore may only be of interest to just one of them.       

1) Speaking Notes Reflecting Comments Made by Rob Hemstock on Alberta 
Electricity Restructuring in March and April 2000

     



2) Concerns Regarding Design of Power Purchase Arrangements

   
       
     
       



3) Concerns Regarding Changes to Power Pool of Alberta Restatement Rules

 

4) Concerns Regarding Formal Implementation of Power Pool Price Cap

   

5) Concerns Regarding Power Pool of Alberta Disclosure of Identity of Bidders 
into Power Pool and Their Prices


  

Regards,

Rob

Attached is the revised document.


PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
- -  Seeking Advice of Counsel - - 

Attached is a draft public statement for your review and comment.  

The groundrules for using these statements are as follows:

All press inquiries should be directed to Eric Thode.

We will use the more "basic statement" unless press inquiries are specific 
and informed by knowledgeable industry participants.

We will use only those parts of the more detailed statement which are 
necessary.

The document begins with a background piece to briefly educate Enron 
personnel who may not be aware of Project Stanley but may be called upon to 
respond to regulators' or customers' inquiries.

Aleck - - please get Seabrou's help filling in the blanks.

Richard - - feel free to forward to outside counsel as you see fit.


 ( REVISED VERSION)
