DPC board to meet in London on Nov 30, Sanjay Jog
...expected to authorise Wade Cline to issue final termination notice to MS=
EB

The Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which is involved in the process of selling=
 its stakes in the distressed Dabhol project, has reconvened its board meet=
ing on November 30 in London, for authorising Enron India managing director=
 K Wade Cline to issue a final termination notice to Maharashtra State Elec=
tricity Board (MSEB). The MSEB and state government, which have a represent=
ation on the DPC board, are likely to skip the ensuing board meeting. The D=
PC, following the acquisition of Enron by Dynegy Inc and the Bombay High Co=
urt's order of November 9 restraining it from serving a final termination n=
otice to MSEB until further order, had cancelled the board meeting original=
ly slated for November 19 in Houston. The MSEB, which holds 30 per cent equ=
ity in the Dabhol Phase-I (740 mw), had taken a serious objection of the No=
vember 19 meeting and had asked DPC to cancel it following the Bombay High =
Court order. Curiously, MSEB has decided to soon send a dissent note to the=
 DPC saying that the stage of issuing final termination notice had come mai=
nly because of DPC's mismanagement.=20

MSEB, which wants to expose DPC's default on the availability of power, in =
its dissent note would also ask the DPC to change the venue of the board me=
eting from London to India. MSEB sources told The Financial Express on Thur=
sday that it has received an intimation from DPC on the proposed board meet=
ing to be held in London. Sources said that it would ask DPC why it suddenl=
y cancelled the Houston meeting and rescheduled it for November 30. MSEB is=
 also likely to question the "wasteful expenditure" involved in the cancell=
ation and reorganisation of the board meeting especially when DPC has been =
complaining about a financial crunch faced by it, following the closure of =
the Dabhol project after the suspension of power by MSEB on May 29. MSEB wo=
uld also pointed out that though there were slippages in the payment of its=
 power purchase bills, it has paid it with interest. Ironically, DPC, which=
 defaulted on the availability of power, refused to accept the April bill a=
nd neither paid the rebate imposed by MSEB for material misrepresentation a=
nd default. The November 30 meeting would also take up issues related to as=
sess preservation, 12 months preservation, financial position of DPC with r=
egard to Dabhol Phase-I, failure in the payment of interest to lenders. The=
 meet would also hold discussion on safeguarding the legal positions of DPC=
 directors, opening of letter of credit of $295 million for shipping. If DP=
C fails to do so there is a likelihood that it may lose the ship arranged f=
or the supply liquified natural gas.=20

Mumbai, Nov 22: Dynegy Inc spokesperson John Sousa has said that Enron-owne=
d assets especially the 2,184 mw Dabhol project would continue to be manage=
d by Enron through the closing of merger, which is expected to be complete =
in the second or third quarter of 2002.  "We are currently beginning the Dy=
negy-Enron merger integration process. Assets currently owned by Enron will=
 continue to be managed by Enron through the closing of our merger, which i=
s expected in 6 to 9 months," he said.

THE TIMES OF INDIA, Friday, November 23, 2001
NGO pegs DPC cost at Rs 1,500 cr=20

The Prayas Energy Group, a research-oriented NGO, has pegged the cost of th=
e Dabhol project at Rs 1,500 crore ($320 million). This figure contrasts sh=
arply with the estimate of Rs 3,800 crore ($800 million) reported to be und=
er consideration by Indian financial institutions. The NGO recently evaluat=
ed the project's worth following news reports about the Dabhol Power Compan=
y selling the stake of its three MNC promoters -Enron, General Electric and=
 Bechtel -for about $ 800 million, after a 30 per cent discounting.

According to Prayas, if Enron is not willing to settle for a reasonable fig=
ure, the Indian financial institutions may come under pressure to absorb th=
e difference to put a full- stop to the endless rounds of controversy the p=
roject has been attracting. ``This is evident in the proposals being discus=
sed, envisaging that the FIs would buy the equity as a warehouse and sell i=
t later. The loss would obviously be theirs,'' says Shantanu Dixit, one of =
the researchers for the group. ``Based on our analysis of the renegotiation=
 committee's report of 1995, the affidavit by the then chief minister Manoh=
ar Joshi in August 1996 in the Bombay high court, and the present financing=
 structure of the project, it could be concluded that the fair cost of equi=
ty of the foreign promoters is not more than $320 million (Rs 1,500 crore),=
'' he says. This estimate is based on the assumption that DPC completes the=
 project in the next six months, without any additional loans. Giving a bre=
ak-up of the estimate, a statement released by the Prayas mentions that in =
the detailed project report submitted to the Central Electricity Authority =
in 1993, Enron has claimed a capital cost of US $ 2,828 million. Following =
re-negotiations in 1996, the Shiv Sena-BJP government claimed this cost had=
 been pared down to U.S. $2,500 million. This is mentioned on Page 3 of the=
 re-negotiation committee's report, which says that ``Enron and DPC represe=
ntatives have given their written consent'' to this reduction.

But, by 1999, DPC's cumulative loans from Indian and foreign institutions w=
ere nearly $2,050 million. This implies that the total equity component of =
the project is only $450 million. Of this, the equity of Maharashtra State =
Electricity Board (MSEB) is $130 million. This brings the total equity put =
in by the foreign promoters to about $320 million. The report points out th=
at on several occasions, Enron has guaranteed completion of the project wit=
hin the agreed cost. ``Hence, any equity claim higher than this amount is u=
njustified and need not be entertained,'' it says. ``In other words, buying=
 the foreign promoter's stake for a price more than $320 million would amou=
nt to a paying a premium to Enron and not discount,'' observes Mr Dixit.

The report notes that just before the work on the project was suspended owi=
ng to the disputes between the MSEB and the DPC, DPC had said the project c=
ost had escalated and it would complete the project at a cost of $3,326 mil=
lion. ``This astonishing cost overrun of $826 million (or 33 per cent of th=
e project cost) is unbelievable, and has to be the result of Enron's ineffi=
ciency,'' says Mr Dixit. It further hiked this figure to $3,690 million, ci=
ting cost overruns since the project was not completed as per schedule. Thi=
s, despite the fact that a few months before the suspension of work, DPC ha=
d claimed that more than 90 per cent of the project was complete. It has no=
w claimed additional costs of $360 million, that is 14 per cent cost overru=
n for completion of the project.

The cumulative difference is of $1,190 million or a cost increase of Rs 5,5=
00 crore, says the report. Now, if this difference has to be accounted for =
in any new power purchase agreement that may be worked out in the future, i=
t would come in for scrutiny by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Comm=
ission. ``There is every likelihood that the MERC would disallow it since i=
t overrides the mutually agreed figure of $2,500 million,'' says Mr Dixit. =
In that case, the relevant party -most probably the government or the finan=
cial institutions -would willy-nilly have to absorb the additional costs cl=
aimed and incur such a needless and huge loss, he says.

'Enron may sell Dabhol at half price' , WASHINGTON

EMBATTLED US power major Enron may be forced to sell its stake in the Dabho=
l power plant at around half a billion dollars instead of the asking price =
of a billion dollars, a report here said. Tata Power and BSES, the Indian b=
idders for Enron's stake in the 2184 mw Dhabol Power Plant were reportedly =
willing to pay only half of the asking price which stood over a billion dol=
lars, the New York Times reported. If the lenders and prospective buyers ad=
opt a take it or leave it line, Enron may have little choice but to accept =
their offer and swallow a huge loss on a controversial project which one gl=
eamed with promise, it said. "It is bound to be a distress sale," one banke=
r told the paper. Though Enron's chairman and chief executive Kenneth L Lay=
 was earlier quoted as saying that India would have to face economic sancti=
ons if the government did not create a favourable climate for the sale of E=
nron's stake, the paper said "Enron now will find little lobbying traction =
in either Washington or New Delhi". "The coalition-building diplomacy of th=
e war in Afghanistan makes it unlikely that the Bush administration would a=
gree to press India on Enron's behalf," the paper said.( PTI )

THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Friday, November 23, 2001
SEES SOLUTION BY MID-DECEMBER; OPERATORSHIP JV OPTION THROWN UP
BG extends Panna Mukta deal with Enron, Sourav Majumdar

British Gas (BG), which has decided to acquire the 30 per cent stake held b=
y Enron in the Panna Mukta Tapti oil and gas fields for about $388 million,=
 has extended the deal indefinitely, pinning its hopes on getting sole oper=
atorship rights for the fields by mid-December. The deal to buy the stake i=
s conditional upon BG getting the operatorship rights which were with Enron=
, and was supposed to have been clinched by October end. BG is now hoping t=
hat the issue will be sorted out by the middle of next month. The other joi=
nt venture partners in the Panna Mukta Tapti fields are Oil and Natural Gas=
 Corporation (ONGC) with a 40 per cent stake, and Reliance with another 30 =
per cent. Both ONGC and Reliance have also staked claim to the operatorship=
 rights.But even as BG holds firm on getting sole operatorship, two other o=
ptions have been thrown up.=20

One option is that of setting up a joint venture operatorship company with =
the three joint venture partners holding stakes reflecting their ownership =
of the mother venture.The other option is to hand over one field each to ea=
ch of the three joint venture partners. However, for BG, it's still a "sole=
 operatorship or nothing" approach. While BG India chief Nigel Shaw was not=
 available for comment, sources close to BG in India confirmed to The Finan=
cial Express that the deal had been extended in view of the hopes that the =
entire issue would be amicably resolved by the middle of December. "For BG,=
 the stance is clear: it wants sole operatorship rights," the sources said.

They said the operatorship issue was critical to the running of the fields,=
 and, therefore, there was no question of continuing with it unless BG got =
the rights. On the other hand, petroleum minister Ram Naik is of the view t=
hat merely because Enron is selling its stake to BG, it does not mean the r=
ights can be transferred automatically to the new buyer. Mr Naik had earlie=
r said that the right of first refusal for operatorship rights was with the=
 other two partners in the joint venture. ONGC's unions have also backed th=
e corporation's claim to operatorship rights, saying that it has enormous e=
xperience in the field and had also discovered the fields. Reliance, on the=
 other hand, staked its claim citing experience and also the fact that it h=
as got 25 blocks in NELP I,II and III.

According to sources associated with the entire issue, the joint venture op=
eratorship company had come up as a suggested solution to the operatorship =
tangle from some quarters, so that all the three joint venture partners cou=
ld be kept in the picture. If this was not feasible, the other suggestion w=
as to distribute the three fields to the three partners. "That way, there w=
ould be some benchmarking possible as each partner would then operate one b=
lock," sources said. BG, however, is not willing to concede anything less t=
han sole operatorship. The fields produce around 300 cubic metres of gas an=
d 29,000 barrels of oil per day. Enron, which has just been taken over by D=
ynegy Inc., had already decided to withdraw from oil and gas in India as pa=

Enron shares in quicksand as merger doubts rise, C BRYSON HULL

Enron Corporation said on Wednesday it secured the remaining $450 million o=
f a new $1 billion credit line, but the news did little to reassure investo=
rs it can stay afloat long enough to complete its merger with rival Dynegy =
Inc. Shares of the Houston-based energy giant were off 26per cent, despite =
the announcement in which Enron also said it had pushed back the deadline f=
or repaying a $690 million debt to mid-December from a deadline of next Tue=
sday. Enron's shares fell 23 per cent on Tuesday, after it raised credit co=
ncerns in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. "The Dynegy=
 deal will take a long time and a lot of things could happen over that time=
 period. Dynegy did their homework, but if they missed anything, they have =
a number of exit opportunities," said Fulcrum Global Partners analyst Micha=
el Barbis. In Wednesday's statement, Enron said it is in feverish talks wit=
h its other lenders to restructure its debt obligations and reaffirmed its =
commitment to the Dynegy deal, tagged at $9 billion in stock."We continue t=
o believe that this merger is in the best interests of our shareholders, em=
ployees, and lenders," Enron chairman and chief executive Ken Lay said. Enr=
on's shares were down $1.83, or 26 per cent, at $5.16 on Wednesday afternoo=
n. It was the most actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange for=
 the second day in a row.

Shares had dipped as low as $4.58 earlier in the day, rebounding somewhat a=
fter the announcement of the new loan. Accounting for stock splits, that is=
 the lowest Enron has been since February 1989. Dynegy shares were off $1.9=
5, or 4.68 per cent, at $39.75. Dynegy chairman and chief executive officer=
 Chuck Watson said he is encouraged by the new $450 million loan and the de=
bt extension for the $690 million. "We are continuing our confirmatory due =
diligence and working to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to co=
mplete the merger in accordance with the previously announced agreement," h=
e said in a statement. Watson said Chevron Texaco, which owns 26 per cent o=
f Dynegy, reiterated its 'full confidence in Dynegy's disciplined managemen=
t approach to complete the merger and to build a new company into an indust=
ry leader.'=20

Privately, analysts were calling the odds of a successful merger lower in t=
he wake of new negative news made in a US Securities and Exchange filing. M=
ost analysts called the chances of success even, where most had called the =
odds of success at 60-70 per cent earlier. Wall Street analysts said Enron =
is losing market share because of credit concerns from its trading partners=
 and questions over Dynegy Inc's takeover offer. "Enron is definitely losin=
g market share on credit concerns. Cash needs to run the business have now =
increased. The market perceives Enron as needing more cash," said Barbis. G=
oldman Sachs downgraded Enron and Dynegy to market perform on Tuesday, and =
took both off its recommended list. Goldman said the cash infusion from Dyn=
egy - $1.5 billion - 'appears inadequate to restore the confidence of Enron=
 customers.' The bad news in Monday's filing with the SEC included the acce=
leration of the $690 million debt because of the credit downgrade, a new re=
duction in third-quarter earnings, word that Enron has only about $1.5 bill=
ion cash on hand after new infusions of $5.5 billion over the past few week=
s and an admission that trading volumes had dropped. (Reuters)

THE HINDU BUSINESS LINE, Friday, November 23, 2001
EU urged to ease market access, NEW YORK, ( carried only by the online edit=
ion)

ENRON Corp, the beleaguered energy trading company, plans to use its minori=
ty interests in power plants to secure a restructured $690 million loan agr=
eement, a source familiar with the plan said. The Houston-based Enron, whic=
h has agreed to be bought by rival Dynegy Inc in a stock-swap merger, discl=
osed in regulatory filings on Monday that it needed to provide collateral f=
or the loan by November 27 or pay it off at an accelerated rate due to a re=
cent ratings downgrade. This week, Citigroup Inc, which arranged the origin=
al $690 million loan, worked with the nearly 20 other banks to extend the p=
ayment schedule to mid-December, the source added. Discussions on repricing=
 the loan are continuing, but the rate is likely to be similar to the terms=
 of a new $1 billion line of credit for Enron, details of which Enron discl=
osed here. Enron said it secured the remaining $450 million in credit for t=
his previously announced $1 billion line. The loan was lead by Citibank, wh=
ich is advising Enron in its merger with Dynegy through its Salomon Smith B=
arney brokerage, and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co, which is also advising Enron o=
n its merger with Dynegy.=20

Worries over a possible default on the $690-million loan and Enron's abilit=
y to fund payments on its looming debt are part of the reason Enron's stock=
 skidded on Tuesday and Wednesday. Enron needs to repay about $9 billion in=
 loans by the end of next year, according to regulatory filings. A lot of t=
he banks were concerned, but all liquidity events can be dealt with a littl=
e patience," the source said. "I don't think there is too much risk of a de=
fault." Citibank arranged the original $690 million "special purpose vehicl=
e" loan facility to finance Enron's investments in stakes in power business=
es, both domestic and internationally. Reviewing operations in Japan: Enron=
 Corp, which has seen its share price fall to a decade low, is reviewing it=
s operations in Japan, including an option to sell the business to a third =
party, a spokeswoman at Enron's Japanese unit in Tokyo said. Japanese media=
 said the Enron group, facing financial difficulties and frustrated by the =
slow progress of Japan's liberalisation of its power market, was considerin=
g withdrawing from the local market. Japanese energy companies have also be=
en hurt by increased competition and slow demand due to the weak economy. "=
Enron Corp is reviewing its operations in Japan...considering every possibi=
lity including retaining the operations or selling a part of it," the spoke=
swoman said. The company will likely finalise its plans within five or six =
weeks, she said. Enron gained its first foothold in Japan in 1999, when it =
established affiliate E Power Corp, hoping to benefit from Japan's deregula=
tion of the retail market.

Title: Atlantic Basin Heating Oil Markets Well Supplied Before Winter 	
URL(s):	

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2800;


***********************************************************************

HIGH INVENTORIES AND WEAK JET DEMAND SHAPE THE HEATING OIL MARKET

Atlantic Basin heating oil markets are comfortably supplied in the lead-up to 
the winter 2001/02 heating season, and accordingly CERA expects much weaker 
distillate-to-crude price differentials than those of a year ago.

*  Primary distillate inventories in North America are well above those of a 
year ago, and German heating oil stocks are as much as 60 million barrels 
higher then last year.

*  Weakening jet fuel demand effectively increases availability of refinery 
distillate supply capability.

*  Distillate consumption in switchable applications in North America will be 
much lower than they were last year, when a very tight natural gas market 
boosted distillate demand.

BUSINESS STANDARD, Monday, October 29, 2001
Enron to pull out of LNG shipping venture for Laxmi=20

Before the final countdown begins for US energy major Enron's actual exit f=
rom Dabhol Power Company (DPC), it has decided to quit the greenfield shipp=
ing venture for Laxmi, the liquefied natural gas carrier expected to reach =
Indian shores on November 15. "Enron's affiliate Atlantic Commercial Inc ha=
s expressed a desire to its partners to exit the special purpose vehicle fo=
r Laxmi in lieu of its decision to move out of the controversial DPC", ship=
ping industry sources said here today. =20

An Enron India spokesperson declined to comment over the development. The S=
hipping Corporation of India (SCI) has a 20 per cent stake in the $220 mill=
ion project while Mitsui OSK Lines holds 60 per cent and the balance rests =
with Atlantic. Earlier, SCI chairman P K Srivastava had said they were conf=
ident of taking delivery of the vessel on November 15, despite the ANZ Inve=
stment Bank-led consortium's decision not to disburse the last tranche of $=
55 million. "The 135,000 cubic metre capacity tanker, costing $189 million,=
 is ready for delivery and we are currently in talks with banks and parties=
 involved in this project", sources said. SCI and Mitsui OSK Lines have a t=
ime charter for 10 years with DPC to transport LNG from Oman to Dabhol. The=
 consortium of 14 banks has already disbursed $110 million, they added.=20

Sources said SCI and OSK Lines have not ruled out alternatives such as depl=
oying the vessel in the spot market due to the approaching winter demand fo=
r the liquid fuel and existing shortage of LNG vessels in the international=
 market. "LNG is an emerging fuel in international spot market and the cons=

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Dabhol agrees to due diligence: BSES chief=20

THE Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) has agreed to the due diligen=

sale process to continue, Mr Shahi said. He said the companies would sign t=

DPC sponsors meet in US next week to discuss due diligence (Carried only by=
 the online edition)

 SENIOR officials of energy major Enron Corp, Bechtel and GE, the three for=
eign sponsors of the troubled Dabhol Power Company, will meet in Houston ne=
xt week to take a decision on whether to proceed with the proposal of due d=
iligence to be carried out by city-based power utilities, the Tata Power Co=
mpany and BSES. "The offshore sponsors of DPC have not yet given their go-a=
head for potential buyers of their 85 per cent equity to commence due dilig=
ence. They are scheduled to meet before this month-end to decide their next=
 step regarding the Dabhol project," sources close to the sponsors said her=
e on Tuesday. When contacted, DPC spokesperson declined to confirm or deny =
the development. Sources said the sponsors' decision would be conveyed to t=
he Industrial Development Bank of India-led consortium of Indian lenders by=
 first week of December. "Contradictory to recent announcements by Indian l=
enders and the prospective buyers, the ability of any party to sign the con=
fidentiality agreement and proceed with due diligence will, after all, depe=
nd on the three foreign sponsors' approval," they pointed out. Both Tatas a=
nd BSES would need their approval and cooperation to commence due diligence=
, sources emphasised.

Tata Power Ltd managing director Adi Engineer confirmed they were yet to co=
mmence DPC due diligence. "We are waiting to sign the confidentiality agree=
ment with DPC sponsors after which Tata Power Ltd would take at least a few=
 months to complete the process," Adi Engineer said. Sources termed the mee=
t as "critical" in deciding the future course of events in resolving the is=
sues surrounding the $3-billion power project. "Enron, GE and Bechtel had r=
aised the issue of continuing costs of fundings during the three-day marath=
on Singapore meet, risen as a result of the Indian and foreign lenders' ref=
usal to disburse additional funds," they informed. The proposed due-diligen=
ce was expected to take another two-three months, sources said, adding situ=
ation had become "more fragile" with Maharashtra State Electricity Board no=
t drawing power since May 29 and lenders stopping disbursements to the 2,81=
4-mw project March onwards. "This has resulted in the beleaguered DPC also =
being unable to meet its loan repayment commitments in September and Octobe=
r," they added. During the Singapore meet, the three foreign sponsors had a=
lso expressed their grave concern about bearing additional expenses as the =
due diligence process would take its own time and incur significant costs, =
only adding to deterioration of assets and their cost burden, the sources s=
aid.

Yesterday, BSES Ltd chairman and managing director R V Shahi had announced =
that the company was likely to complete the due diligence of the Dabhol pro=
ject by January end next year. Shahi said BSES has returned the draft of co=
nfidentiality agreement with comments to DPC. BSES would appoint three sepa=
rate consultants for doing technical, financial and legal due diligence alo=

Enron crisis deepens, bankruptcy looms (Carried only by the online edition)

The crisis of confidence ravaging cash-strapped Enron deepened on Wednesday=
 amid mounting concerns that a proposed rescue by rival Dynegy could fall t=
hrough, threatening the energy giant with bankruptcy. While the Houston-bas=
ed energy giant said it secured the remaining $450 million of a new $1 bill=
ion credit line and pushed back the deadline for repaying a $690 million de=
bt, its shares fell a further 28 per cent, after falling 23 per cent on Tue=
sday. "If Dynegy steps away entirely from the merger, Enron's credit situat=
ion seems untenable with a bankruptcy filing highly possible," rating agenc=
y Fitch Investors said. UBS Warburg analyst Ron Barone said, "Bankruptcy wo=
uld not be out of the question if the merger fell through or ran into obsta=
cles." "We believe the odds of Enron incurring a material adverse change on=
 its operations is soaring," Barone said in a research note, saying that Dy=
negy may invoke clauses allowing it to walk away from or alter the terms of=
 the $9 billion agreement. In a statement, Enron said it was in feverish ta=
lks with its other lenders to restructure its debt obligations and reaffirm=
ed its commitment to the Dynegy deal. "We continue to believe that this mer=
ger is in the best interests of our shareholders, employees, and lenders," =
Enron chairman and chief Executive Ken Lay said. JP Morgan Chase vice chair=
man James Lee said in the same statement that Chase believes its interests =
and those of Enron and its other primary lenders are aligned, and that the =
bank would "develop a plan to strengthen Enron's financial position up to a=
nd through its merger with Dynegy."

SHARES HIT 1989 LEVELS
Enron's shares fell $1.98, or 28 per cent, to close at $5.01. It was the mo=
st actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange for the second day =
in a row. The shares had dipped as low as $4.58 earlier in the day, rebound=
ing slightly after Enron's announcement. Accounting for stock splits, that =
is the lowest Enron has been since February 1989. Dynegy shares were off $1=
.94, or 4.65 per cent, at $39.76. Dynegy Chairman and Chief Executive Offic=
er Chuck Watson said he is encouraged by the new loan and debt extension. H=
e said in a statement that Dynegy was working to "accelerate the regulatory=
 approvals required to complete the merger". Watson said ChevronTexaco, whi=
ch owns 26 per cent of Dynegy, reiterated its "full confidence" in Dynegy's=
 ability to complete the merger. Privately, analysts were calling the odds =
of success lower since Enron made a filing with the Securities and Exchange=
 Commission on Monday alerting investors to its credit crunch.

Most analysts interviewed by Reuters called the chances even, where earlier=
 they had called odds of success at 60-70 per cent. However, one analyst sa=
id he thought emotion was driving the current stock moves, and that it come=
s despite three powerful factors in favor of the deal. "The bottom line, En=
ron needs this to happen, Dynegy wants this to happen, and ChevronTexaco is=
 supportive of it happening," Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Laune=
r said. Goldman Sachs downgraded Enron and Dynegy to market perform, and to=
ok both off its recommended list. Goldman said the cash infusion from Dyneg=
y -- $1.5 billion -- "appears inadequate to restore the confidence of Enron=
 customers." Enron's trading partners, now more publicly than before, on Tu=
esday said they were treading carefully.
"We've been scaling back for some time, but we're still dealing with Enron.=
 Everyday, our credit people are watching," said Al Butkus, a vice presiden=
t with Kansas City-based Utilicorp United.The trading business, Enron's cro=
wn jewel and the part most coveted by Dynegy, relies on volume for profitab=
ility, and Enron has said it was possible that the lower volumes would hamp=
er fourth-quarter earnings. One indicator of Enron's shape was the fact tha=
t its bonds are now being quoted by price, like junk bonds, rather than by =
how much extra yield they carry over US treasuries, like investment-grade b=
onds.

The company's 6.4 per cent notes maturing in 2006 and 6.75 per cent notes m=
aturing in 2009 were respectively bid Wednesday afternoon at 62 and 60 cent=
s on the dollar, each down from the high-60s on Tuesday. Their yields to ma=
turity were a respective 19 and 16 per cent. Its 20-year zero-coupon conver=
tible bonds traded Wednesday at just over 34 cents on the dollar, down from=
 38 cents on Tuesday.

THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Thursday, November 22, 2001
Enron closes a decade low at $7=20

THE LATEST negative disclosures from Enron on Tuesday speared its stock pri=
ce, which crashed to a decade low after new debt problems and an earnings r=
evision emerged a day earlier. Shares of Enron closed down $2.07, or 22.8 p=
er cent, at $6.99 on the New York Stock Exchange, after touching $6.55 duri=
ng the day -- a low not seen since May 1991. Enron was far and away the day=
's most active stock, with more than 62.8 million shares changing hands. Vo=
lume was more than double the second most active issue, Xerox Corp.

Meanwhile, credit rating agency Standard & Poor's said it may again cut the=
 Houston company's BBB-minus rating, which could trigger those debt payoffs=
. But the agency said Enron's liquidity issues were unlikely to derail its =
merger with smaller cross-town rival Dynegy, announced November 9. "This is=
 as high a high-wire act as I have ever seen," analyst John Olson of invest=
ment house Sanders Morris Harris said. "If this merger is to survive, equit=
y investors will need to have a reason to buy the stock and their confidenc=
e will need to be restored, because the equity investor has been leading th=
e way down." Enron's hellish Tuesday on the market came after the company m=
ade new disclosures in a US Securities and Exchange document, filed after t=
he market closed on Monday. Most pressing was news that Enron has until Nov=
ember 26 to put up $690 million in collateral against a debt to a partnersh=
ip. Otherwise, the partnership could begin liquidating assets, including a =
Brazilian gas company which Enron plans to sell to raise $250 million. In t=
he SEC filing, known as a Form 10-Q, Enron said it was suffering a decrease=
 in trading volumes, particularly in longer-term deals.

TRADING VOLUME DOWN

Since the trading business -- Enron's crown jewel and the segment most cove=
ted by Dynegy -- is low-margin, volume drives its profitability. It is too =
early to tell what effect the lower volumes would have on future profitabil=
ity, Enron said, but analyst Andre Meade of Commerzbank Securities said Dyn=
egy will watch the volume drop carefully. "If it has a long-term effect, it=
 will definitely impact the value Dynegy will put on this business," he sai=
d. Dynegy gave a limited response when asked if it was concerned about lowe=
r volumes, and whether it was aware of the $690 million debt before it made=
 its deal to acquire Enron. "We are in due diligence and Enron's 10-Q is a =
part of that process," Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said.

Meade said the filing yet again showed Enron's penchant for making disclosu=
res bit-by-bit. Of note was its latest downward revision of its third-quart=
er earnings, he said. "The restatements are coming out piecemeal as they fi=
nd them, and my guess is they don't know the full extent. We think further =
revisions are likely," Meade said. One analyst who follows Enron said the S=
EC filing painted a darker picture of the company's cash position, given th=
at it had $2.3 billion on hand as of Nov. 16. "It shows that the cash drain=
 on the company looks to be very significant," said the analyst, who asked =
not to be identified.

Standard & Poor's said Enron currently has about $1.5 billion in cash, but =
that follows an infusion in recent weeks of $1.5 billion from the Dynegy me=
rger, $550 million in loans secured by pipeline assets, and $3 billion from=
 its revolving credit lines. Another $450 pipeline-backed loan is expected =
in a day or two, and Enron said it expects $500 million of private equity i=
nvestment plus $800 million from asset sales. Enron owes $9.15 billion by t=
he end of next year, and its total liability for debt and other obligations=
 is $16.86 billion, according to the SEC filing. Its merger with Dynegy is =
expected to close by the third quarter of 2002, raising the possibility tha=
t an Enron without investment-grade credit might not have the liquidity to =
survive that long.

Enron acknowledged as much in the SEC filing, stating starkly that it would=
 be unlikely to "to continue as a going concern," if a credit rating cut tr=
iggers the early payoff of $3.9 billion in debts to partnerships to which i=
t belongs. Enron said that if its rating were cut, it would work out other =
payment arrangements. S&P said a similar effort being undertaken in the cas=
e of the $690 million debt will likely be successful "given the alignment o=
f the interests between Enron and the banks." Enron spokesman Vance Meyer s=
aid the company had received verbal indications that the deadline on that d=

Unprecedented defence ties on way: Blackwill

US envoy Robert D Blackwill has said, "conclusive acceleration" of Indo-US =
defence cooperation is progressing, "in an unprecedented way". Mr Blackwill=
 listed, "joint exercises, education, intelligence, civilian nuclear safety=
 cooperation, a joint cyber terrorism initiative, and military to military =
cooperation", as areas where the two countries will be engaged in during a =
flurry of visits over the next 2-3 weeks. This includes chief of US Pacific=
 command Admiral Dennis Blair and US under secretary of defence Douglas Fei=
th. Mr Feith is the third senior-most official at the Pentagon. Mr Blackwil=
l also made direct references to "sale of arms" and "spares", as areas whic=
h will see future cooperation. He was speaking at the Foreign Correspondent=
s\' Club here. Even as he read out, "an ennumerative list of strategic coop=
eration in the months and years ahead," the envoy cautioned that won't give=
 "a flat promise" on such matters. "Fundamentally, it is for both sides to =
earn each other's trust. Yes, the US has had an episodic and an ad hoc appr=
oach in the past, but then September 11 has changed our position on terrori=
sm, as it has for the entire world. Is there any use in insisting on a hist=
orical approach lifted from the Cold War? But having said all this, I can't=
 give a flat promise to any country. US policies are in the hands of our pe=
ople, who in turn express themselves through their representatives".=20

Asked if unprecedented cooperation meant that Enron was no longer 'a five l=
etter word' jarring the Indo-US commercial dialogue, Mr Blackwill cautioned=
, "Enron remains a problem. We hope there will be a quick, and mutually acc=
eptable resolution. The problem continues to pass a very dark shadow. That =
remains true to this day". In a reaction, Indo-American Chamber of Commerce=
 regional president Bimal Sareen, who was in the audience, endorsed Mr Blac=
kwill's assessment. "It is extremely critical for the (Indian) government t=
o take a proactive stand on an expeditious solution...Enron is casting a cl=
oud over foreign investment," Mr Sareen told The Financial Express. "Of cou=
rse, expansion of commercial relations into defence, and more security coop=
eration will greatly help in renewal of confidence," Mr Sareen added.=20

On a more general note, Mr Blackwill said the regime on high tech commerce =
will be allowed to flow "on the assumption of approval rather than denial".=
 On terrorism, the envoy showed heightened understanding of what India has =
repeatedly complained about. "There are no exceptions in this war. We won't=
 allow terrorism against the US. Nor will we allow terrorism against India.=
 So, without (addressing concerns of) India, this war (against the Al Qaeda=
) won't be complete otherwise. US and India are in this battle together. An=
d as secretary of defence Don Rumsfeld has said on Fox TV, there is no diff=
erence between terrorist networks....a terrorist is a terrorist is a terror=
ist. He can never be a freedom fighter. Also, no country will be allowed to=
 provide a sanctuary to terrorists". On Afghanistan, Mr Blackwill said, "th=
e US sees India as a central player in the assistance once the war is over"=
 He talked of the forthcoming visits of US special coordinator Richard Haas=
, and US envoy on Afghanistan James Dobbins to India and defended the exclu=
sion of 'moderate Taliban' elements in the forthcoming Berlin conclave, quo=
ting US national security advisor Condoleeza Rice. In Ms Rice's view, "mode=
rate and Taliban don't go together".=20

Fitch thumbs down to India currency ratings (Carried only by the online edi=
tion)

International rating agency, Fitch, on Wednesday downgraded India's soverei=
gn foreign and local currency ratings to 'BB' and 'BB+', respectively, from=
 'BB+' and 'BBB-' (triple B minus). However, the rating agency changed its =
outlook to 'stable' from 'negative' in recognition of India's continuing ex=
ternal strengths. Fitch said that this rating action -- presaged by a chang=
e in the outlook from 'stable' to 'negative' in May 2001 -- has been prompt=
ed by India's continued fiscal profligacy, while an unfavourable political =
environment is hindering economic reforms. Further, while changing its outl=
ook to 'stable' from 'negative', Fitch cautions that \"the outlook for the =
local currency rating remains negative because of high and rising domestic =
debt and weak public finances.\"=20

The rating downgrades reflect the absence of any significant improvement in=
 India's public finances and slow progress on disinvestment. Persistent gen=
eral government deficits of over 9 per cent of GDP are the highest among 'B=
B' Fitch-rated sovereigns. "The agency believes that fiscal consolidation e=
nvisioned for 2001 is unlikely to materialise due to revenue shortfalls ari=
sing from the current economic slowdown and the inability of the government=
 to cut expenditures. More importantly, the composition of the fiscal defic=
it has deteriorated, with a sizable part of the revenue deficit attributabl=
e to rising public consumption. Interest payments constitute 50% of revenue=
s and leave little room for social and capital spending,\" said Fitch Sover=
eign's director, Paul Rawkins.=20

Like China, India's large domestic market and the closed nature of its econ=
omy makes it less vulnerable to external shocks. Nonetheless, it is unlikel=
y to escape unscathed from the current global economic downturn. Declining =
exports have already induced a dramatic slowdown in industrial production a=
nd capital spending. Lower oil prices and sluggish non-oil imports should, =
however, help to contain the deterioration in current account deficit, whic=
h remains manageable at around 1 per cent of GDP. India's 'BB' foreign curr=
ency rating balances this factor plus continuing improvements in its extern=
al solvency and liquidity ratios against a prospective deterioration in the=
 foreign investment climate (and hence non-debt creating flows) consequent =
upon the Enron case.

US energy major Enron has ousted its finance director amid an investigation=

Reliance shelves LNG project, Anto T Joseph=20

THE DABHOL imbroglio and the current uncertainty in the liquefied natural g=
as market has forced the Reliance Group to put its $5-billion LNG project o=
n the backburner.=20

The petroleum and petrochemicals major had signed an MoU in February 2001 w=
ith British Petroleum and National Iranian Oil Company, for an eight-millio=
n tonne per annum LNG project. The decision to slow down implementation of =
the LNG project is believed to have taken after the Reliance-BP-NIOC consor=
tium completed a feasibility study for the proposed project.=20

Reliance and BP would hold a 25 per cent stake each in the project, and the=
 remaining stake will be with NIOC if and when the project is implemented. =
A Reliance spokesperson, however, said the company was going ahead with the=
 project. The Reliance gameplan was to upgrade capacity at its Jamnagar ter=
minal. The Jamnagar port is ideally equipped to handle LNG as there is no n=
eed for building costly breakwater and dredging facilities, which makes LNG=
 handling much more economical and competitive.=20

The proposed project is the largest so far in India and a whole network con=
sisting of the liquefaction plant, regassification plant, LNG terminal and =
transportation facilities was supposed to come up.=20

Sources said Reliance was finding it difficult to put in place contracts an=
d agreements because of the lack of potential end users.=20

"After Enron's Dabhol Power Company ran into a severe payment crisis, in th=
e process exposing the unviability of LNG as an alternate fuel for base loa=
d plant, India is unlikely to see setting up of any LNG-based projects. Man=
y LNG players i who have already executing their projects, but have suddenl=

Trouble in Enron drives online energy trade to the edge, Gelu Sulugiuc=20

ENRON almost daily revelations of fresh troubles has prompted concerns its =
powerful position in online energy trading could prompt a credit crunch and=
 rock the fast-growing industry. Though experts said yesterday that EnronOn=
line, Enron's Web trading platform, should survive, investors are skittish =
about the No 1 US natural gas and electricity marketer.=20

Since last week Enron has shed more than $13 billion in market value as sha=
res plunged, forcing it on Wednesday to replace its chief financial officer=
, who was linked to transactions now under investigation by government regu=
lators.=20

In the latest blow, credit rating agency Fitch yesterday placed Enron debt =
securities on negative credit watch, saying the erosion of investor confide=
nce, if unabated, would impair the company's access to capital markets.=20

"We put them on a list of concerns two months ago and made sure our books w=
ere balanced just as the first stage of precaution," said one energy trader=
 active on EnronOnline. About 60 per cent of all transactions by Enron are =
captured through EnronOnline, and so far traders have kept faith.=20

On Wednesday, EnronOnline - in which trades always involve Enron as either =
the buyer or seller - conducted 8,000 transactions through its site, with a=
 notional value of $4 billion, more than daily its average of $3.5 billion.=
=20

"People are transacting at higher levels as they prepare their portfolios f=
or the winter and to protect themselves from price volatility," said Vance =
Meyer, an Enron spokesman.=20

Not even Enron itself anticipated the success of EnronOnline, which enjoys =
the highest volume of any platform in the cut-throat field of Internet ener=
gy trade. Initially, the company set a yearly trading volume target of $30 =
billion to 40 billion - business it now does in 10 days alone.=20

Yet traders worry Enron's spectacular fall from grace could make it a less =
solid counterparty in certain eyes after transactions with two limited part=
erships run by Andrew Fastow sparked investigations by the US Securities an=
d Exchange Commission. Enron replaced Fastow as its CFE on Wednesday in the=
 hope it would restore investor confidence.=20

"I haven't seen any sign of them slowing down or not making a good market o=
n EnronOnline, but until things get squared away, I will keep a tight leash=
 on the credit issue," one trader said. "The only thing that bothers me is =
it takes a lot of capital to do what they're doing, and with the stock pric=
e down, I wonder how much credit they have left," he added.=20

Enron said this week that it can tap a $3.35 billion credit line to support=
 its trading and marketing business, which can experience wide swings in ca=
sh flow depending on commodity prices.=20

"In the event of a 'push-comes-to-shove' liquidity crunch, we believe the c=
ompany could generate substantial cash by selling a variety of other assets=
," said Ron Barone, an analyst at UBS Warburg.=20

If EnronOnline does lose steam, the big winner will be its main rival Atlan=
ta-based Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) - which already routinely trades m=

s in the armor and some people may stop using EnronOnline," said Kyle Coope=

 alternative online platform."=20

EnronOnline is still a force to be reckoned with, experts said. "Enron clea=

Petronet LNG may up enhance Dahej capacity

PETRONET LNG, a joint venture of four public sector oil and gas majors, is =
considering doubling the capacity of its under-construction Dahej liquefied=
 natural gas terminal in Gujarat to 10 million tonnes.=20

"We are considering a proposal of doubling the present 5 million tonnes cap=
acity of Dahej terminal as we see tremendous demand in the future," said Su=
resh Mathur, chief executive officer and managing director, Petronet LNG.=
=20

While the subject is under study, Petronet LNG will firm up plans once the =
Dahej terminal nears completion. A joint venture of Oil & Natural Gas Corpo=
ration, Gas Authority of India, Bharat Petroleum and IndianOil, Petronet LN=
G is planning another terminal of 2.5 million tonnes capacity at Kochi in K=
erala.=20

French gas major Gaz de France and RasGas of Qatar, which will supply LNG t=
o the terminals for a 25-year period beginning 2003, also hold equity stake=
 in the Petronet LNG. The Dahej project involves the construction of a rega=
sification terminal, a liquefaction train in Qatar to be built by RasGas an=
d two methane tankers. A consortium led by Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Indust=
ries of Japan is executing the $317-million engineering, procurement and co=
nstruction contract at Dahej.=20

Work on the Dahej terminal, expected to begin operation by December 2003, w=
as progressing on schedule and on cost, said Mathur. "Around 2,000 people h=
ave been mobilised for the construction of the jetty and storage tanks."=20

The capacity enhancement would involve construction on an additional storag=
e tank with an investment of around $70 million. While Petronet LNG has the=
 option to acquire the 5-million-tonne capacity Dhabol LNG terminal of US e=
nergy major Enron Corporation, Mathur denied there were any such plan.=20

Enron's LNG terminal at Dabhol was set up to supply regassified LNG to Dabh=
ol Power Corporation for use in its power plant, and the remainder to other=
 bulk users. In the wake of the tussle over power dues with Maharashtra Sta=
te Electric Board, one of the partners in Dabhol Power, Enron is trying to =
sell off both projects.=20

Indian consumption of natural gas has risen faster than any other fuel in r=
ecent years. From only 0.6 trillion cubic feet per year in 1995, natural ga=
s use was nearly 0.8 Tcf in 1999 and is projected to reach 1.3 Tcf in 2005 =
and 1.8 Tcf in 2010.=20

With domestic gas production far short of demand, India is encouraging proj=
ects for import of LNG. The government is of the view that the dozen or so =
terminal projects in the pipeline would be able to meet the needs of gas-fi=
red electric power plants and bring down the cost of power generation. (IAN=

Lenders to meet over Enron's Dabhol on Nov 3=20
 Lenders to power plant in India majority owned by Enron have called a meet=
ing next week in London to discuss ways of reviving the beleaguered project=
, a banking source said on Saturday. They will examine offers that two Indi=
an companies have put forward for buying the US energy giant's 65 per cent =
stake, and those of two other US firms, in Dabhol Power Company, which is b=
uilding the controversial project, the source said.

The meeting of lenders, who include multinational banks such as Citibank, B=
ank of America, will be held on November 3, the source added. At stake is n=
ot just the fate of the $2.9 billion, 2,184 MW project, which is India's la=
rgest foreign direct investment, but also the over $600 million investment =
of Enron, General Electric and Bechtel. All three companies are founders of=
 DPC, which in 1995 got permission from India's Maharashtra state governmen=
t to set up the plant on its coast.

The plant's first phase of 740 MW was completed in 1999, but work on the se=
cond phase of 1,444 MW, which is 97 per cent complete, was abruptly stopped=
 in June this year following a blazing row with cash-strapped state utility=
 MSEB.

MSEB, which agreed in 1995 to take the plant's entire output, said it can n=
o longer do so because Dabhol's power is too costly. Dabhol, in turn, accus=
ed MSEB of defaulting on its monthly payments and served a preliminary noti=
ce to terminate the power purchase contract.

Under this notice, both companies are given six months time to settle the m=
atter through negotiations. If talks fail, Dabhol has the right to issue a =
final termination notice and take the matter to arbitration in London. That=
 six month period expires on November 19.

Houston-based Enron, which owns 65 per cent of Dabhol, further announced th=
at it intends to exit the project and offered to sell its equity to the Ind=
ian government.

TIME RUNNING OUT

The Business Standard newspaper reported that next week's meeting would als=
o discuss a request by Dabhol to finally terminate the contract after Novem=
ber 19.

"It is one of the items on the agenda," the paper quoted a senior banker as=
 saying. The paper said once Dabhol serves the final notice, the matter pro=
ceeds to arbitration, which would not help India. "The widespread view amon=
g the government and lenders is that in such a situation DPC will win hands=
 down," the paper added.

A Dabhol spokesman could not be contacted immediately. The source said the =
meeting would review the progress made in resolving the dispute so far.

The Indian government has not responded to Enron's offer to buy its equity,=
 but two Indian companies, BSES and Tata Power, have shown interest.  They =
have agreed to take over the project if the cost is reduced, and if the fou=
nders agree to sell their stake at a discount.

Local business daily, the Economic Times reported on Friday that Tata Power=
 and BSES are willing to pay the founders $450-$600 million for the 85 per =
cent stake held by Enron, GE and Bechtel.

Enron has rejected the offer and is not ready to settle for anything less t=
han $1 billion, the paper added. Officials of Tata Power and BSES were not =
immediately available for comment.( REUTERS )

Loans to DPC based on MSEB's letter of credit: Bank of America
=20
Bank of America (BoA), which is the onshore trustee for the secured parties=
 of Dabhol Power Company (DPC), in an application before the Supreme Court,=
 has said that the secured lenders in making their loans to the "distressed=
" 2,184 mw Dabhol project has relied on the validity of the letter of credi=
t (L/C) established by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and t=
he non-payment under the L/C would inevitably result in non-payment of the =
lender's debt. The trustee submitted that "had the secured lenders known th=
at the MSEB would seek to prevent the honouring of the L/C, they would not =
have made the loans to the project."=20

The BoA in its application has appealed to the Supreme Court (SC) to implea=
d it as a respondent in the special leave petition (SLP) filed by the MSEB =
on September 17 challenging the Mumbai High Court allowing the DPC to invok=
e the L/C of Rs 136 crore for the recovery of the April bill from MSEB. The=
 BoA has prayed that the SC should dismiss the MSEB's SLP and also vacate i=
ts (Supreme Court) order of September 21 staying the Mumbai High Court orde=
r. The BoA has pooh-poohed MSEB's argument that it would suffer irreparable=
 harm if payment under the L/C was made. "The trustee respectfully submits =
that harm to MSEB is not a relevant consideration to the payment by Canara =
Bank to the trustee under the L/C which is a separate contract made and ass=
igned before the controversy arose between the MSEB and DPC."=20

The BoA has reiterated its plea that the SC, which would hold a hearing on =
November 2, should dismiss MSEB's SLP and grant interim relief as it would =
be directly affected by any order passed by the apex court. In this case, t=
he trustee as beneficiary has sought to draw funds (Rs 136 crore) payable t=
o it under the irrevocable L/C dated May 12, 1999 and signed by Canara Bank=
, which has not disputed its obligation to pay. The Mumbai High Court in it=
s September 14 order properly determined that under settled principles of I=

circumstances that require clear proof by the beneficiary and knowledge of =
clear fraud by the issuing bank."

Howdy Ags!!

The two-year remembrance of the Aggie Bonfire collapse is upon us.  We still unfortunately have no Bonfire, but there is something we, as Aggies, can get together and do to remember our Bonfire 12.

Off Campus Aggies and The Association of Former Students are sponsoring the second annual Everyone Bleeds Maroon Bonfire Memorial Blood Drive. Now, through this weekend, with the help of The Reveille Club of Houston and many A&M clubs throughout the state and nation, we will remember and honor our 12 fallen Aggies.  

As you know, many around the state and country rallied around us at our darkest hour, and this is one little way, even when Bonfire returns, to show our appreciation for the support they gave us at our greatest time of need.  It's also a tremendous way to show we will not forget what happened on November 18, 1999.  Several of the families have expressed their support for this endeavor, and I think we need to do all we can to show them how much a part of the Aggie family they are, and how strong the Aggie Spirit is, was, and always will be.  

The need for blood is a constant battle for blood banks around the country.  The holidays are especially critical as donation levels typically fall while the need for donations actually rises.  In the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, record numbers of Americans turned out to give blood.  What many may not know is that the blood collections are only good for a limited amount of time.  This week begins the period when many units of blood collected will need to be replaced. 

Last year, with very little notice, Aggies rallied to support our cause. We raised more 5,300 units of blood in 200.  Our goal for this year is to see 12,000 units of blood donated, and details on all the drives can be found at http://bleedmaroon.tamu.edu.   Also, most donation sites have a limited supply of Everyone Bleeds Maroon Bonfire Memorial Blood Drive T-shirts that you will receive in thanks for donating.  

Drives will be held on Saturday, November 17 in Angelino County (Lufkin), Dallas, Ft. Worth, Denver (CO), Ft. Hood/Killeen, Houston and surrounding areas, Karnes City, Kingwood, Longview, Marshall, McAllen, and New Braunfels.  Drives are going on throughout the week in Austin, Beaumont, TAMU-Galveston, Phoenix (AZ), and into next week in San Antonio and Nacogdoches County.  Phoenix has challenged alumni in their area from all Big 12 schools to donate as a sort of friendly competition.

Here on the Texas A&M University campus, you can donate at the Commons, Rudder, the Rec Center, Bush Academic Building, Duncan, Zachary, Vet School, Bio-Bio, Sbisa, and Wehner.  

Even if you can't make it out on the specific day to the specific place you can still get in touch with the blood bank in your area and ask to donate in the name of Everyone Bleeds Maroon. 

If you gave in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks you can still safely be a part of this event. Please pass this on and help spread the word.  We hope everyone will take the time to get out and give this week, and do their part in remembering the fallen of Nov. 18, 1999 as well as those no longer with us as of Sept. 11, 2001.

This is for Miranda, Jerry, Bryan, Tim, Jamie, Michael, Jeremy, Christopher B., Chris H., Lucas, Chad, Nathan, and all of the injured.  We'll never forget.  

Thanks, Gig 'Em, and God Bless America.

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Free Opera in the Park featuring Houston Grand Opera's Carmen, June 8-10!
Houston Grand Opera's sensational Multimedia Modular Stage production returns for three FREE performances at Houston's Miller Outdoor Theatre on June 8-10 at 8:30 p.m. Bizet's fiery gypsy Carmen, everybody's favorite femme fatale, ignites the summer in a powerhouse production that had audiences and critics cheering when it was first unveiled in 1998.

Houston Grand Opera's revolutionary Multimedia Modular Stage (MMS), with its giant "live" video screens, hydraulic platforms, and hundreds of rotating, colored lights takes the incredible energy onstage and transports it to the farthest reaches of the outdoor venue with a visceral impact equal to that of a rock concert!

Tickets for the reserved seating will be issued between the hours of 11:30am and 1:00pm through the Miller Theatre box office on the day of the performance.  Any remaining tickets will be issued one hour before the performance.

THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Tuesday, October 23, 2001
Former SC judge Kurdukar to investigate Dabhol deal, Sanjay Jog 

The Maharashtra government on Monday has finally appointed the retired Supreme Court judge Sadashiv Kurdukar to head the judicial commission to probe into the multi-crore Dabhol Power Company (DPC) deal. Mr Kurdukar's name has been finalised at a meeting between the chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and state energy minister Padmasinh Patil. The commission is expected to complete its inquiry within six months since its appointment.. The formal announcement in this regard is expected after the weekly cabinet meeting on Wednesday. State government sources told The Financial Express that Mr Kurdukar's name has been shortlisted from the list of 15 judges by the law and judiciary department. Though former Supreme Court chief justice YV Chandrachud, former SC justices Sujata Manohar and PB Sawant were on forefront, they have believed to have expressed their inability to take on the job in view of their preoccupations.

A.V. Birla 'not keen' on Dabhol=20

THE A.V. Birla group today said it is not interested in buying a stake in t=
he Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Co (DPC), although it appears to have studie=
d the power project. In a statement, the group said it has ``looked'' at th=
e Dabhol project but is ``not interested in pursuing an equity investment i=
n DPC.'' Currently, financial institutions are considering proposals put fo=
rth by Tata Power Co and BSES Ltd to pick up Enron's 65 per cent stake in D=
PC. However, Ms Jayawantiben Mehta, Union Minister of State for Power, has =
said that any third party stepping in to bid for Enron would be welcomed by=
 the Government as that would increase competition, thereby reducing price.=
 Ms Mehta was responding to queries by mediapersons on the reported entry o=
f a third bidder for DPC on the sidelines of a banking and finance seminar =
here. ``Our only mission is to increase generation of power and make it ava=
ilable at cheaper prices. Buying power from Enron is an option only if the =
power tariff is reasonable,'' Ms Mehta said.=20

Regarding the sale of Enron's stake in DPC, she said there was a specific t=
ime-frame assigned for completing the due diligence process. ``Once the pro=
cess is complete it will not take time to finalise a deal,'' she said. Talk=
ing about the disbursements for the Accelerated Power Development Project (=
APDP), Ms Mehta admitted to delays in disbursements earlier but the Governm=
ent has learnt from these mistakes and will try to make the process quicker=
, she said. She added, ``The Government has decided to allocate Rs 113.95 c=
rore to Bombay Electricity Supply and Transport Company (BEST) for the year=
 2001-2002 for transmission, distribution and convergence purposes. The dis=
bursements will be made shortly. A special account will be opened for these=
 funds with the State Government. This money is to be used within a period =
of one year but BEST will be given additional funds as and when they need i=
t.'' The total allocation for Maharashtra under APDP is more than Rs 300 cr=

DPC board meet on course despite MSEB dissent note, Sanjay Jog

Dabhol Power Company (DPC), notwithstanding the dissent note filed by the M=
aharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), is firm on holding its board mee=
ting on November 30 in London to authorise Enron India managing director K =
Wade Cline to issue a final termination notice to the MSEB. MSEB chairman V=
inay Bansal and state principal secretary VM Lal, who are directors on the =
DPC board, have decided not to attend the meeting. DPC spokesperson Jimmy M=
ogal confirmed that the DPC board meeting would take place as per schedule.=
 "The November 30 meeting will take place as it is a statutory company law =
requirement," he told The Financial Express. Mr Mogal, however, declined to=
 comment on the receipt of a dissent note from the MSEB blaming DPC for its=
 mismanagement which led to a situation for the issuance of a final termina=
tion notice. According to MSEB sources, it has questioned the holding of No=
vember 30 meeting especially when it had cancelled the previous board meeti=
ng scheduled for November 19 in London at the last minute. MSEB has also de=
manded a change in the venue of the meeting from London to Mumbai. The stat=
e electricity board has also taken an objection for the ensuing meeting esp=
ecially when the Bombay high court has already restrained DPC from issuing =
a final termination notice to it in its November 9 ad interim order granted=
 on a civil suit filed by financial institutions.

MSEB has reiterated its claim that it was DPC's successive material misrepr=
esentation and default on the availability of power which led to the presen=
t situation. Had DPC corrected its capacity availability after the MSEB imp=
osed rebate for the first time in February, the situation would not have re=
ached this stage, sources added. MSEB also blamed DPC for non-payment of re=
bate of Rs 401 crore imposed by it for the default on the availability of p=
ower on January 28. Furthermore, it also defaulted on February 13 and March=
 29 and failed to pay successive rebates revised thereafter. The November 3=
0 meeting would also take up issues related to asset preservation, financia=
l position of phase-I, debt servicing of phase-II and opening of letter of =
credit for the charter. Meanwhile, MSEB technical director (corporate plann=
ing) Prem Paunikar, who is also on the DPC board, has resigned for personal=
 reasons. He will be relieved on November 29. Mr Paunikar will be replaced =
by Mr Gurcharan Singh, who is currently in charge of hydrogrid.

Life after Enron

OBITUARIES for the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) were premature. With every pa=
ssing week, it appears that the 2,100 MW power project in Maharashtra is li=
kely to be reincarnated in a new, improved avatar. The domestic troubles of=
 Enron, the Houston-based energy giant that owns 65 per cent of DPC equity,=
 have actually made DPC more attractive to local buyers. The Aditya Vikram =
Birla group now joins BSES and Tata Power as suitors for the stake of Enron=
, and maybe the additional 20 per cent equally owned by GE and Bechtel, whi=
ch are also keen to exit. Enron initially valued DPC equity at $1.1 billion=
. However, it has become clear that it will have to take a discount on this=
: the final figure could come down to $700 million or even less. The prospe=
ct of buying out a state-of-the-art power plant at a very attractive price =
has attracted companies like BSES, Tata Power and now, the AV Birla group.=
=20

What Enron needs now is cash: finances of the Houston giant are shaky and i=
t has to arrange credit for nearly $700 million debt quickly. Given that, I=
ndian buyers can winkle out an even bigger discount by agreeing to pay the =
money up front, instead of in instalments. Inevitably, lenders will also ha=
ve to write down interest on debt, or even take some writeoffs to bring deb=
t in line with lower equity valuation. Once the financial restructuring is =
complete, DPC power will become affordable. Or will it? Arguably, electrici=
ty has been India's most reform-proof sector. This resistance to change has=
 deep roots: in administrative collapse, populist politics, the dominance o=
f the public sector at the Centre and states; in corruption, regulatory fai=
lure or apathy and with consumers who are used to getting power free. To ma=
ke DPC - or any power project - viable in the long run, consumers have to s=
tart paying for electricity. Failing that, utilities should cut them off. T=
his will need a great deal of support from state administrations. SEBs have=
 to be privatised. If the new Electricity Bill is made into law, states wil=
l have the freedom to privatise distribution without amending local laws, I=
PPs will be able to sell power to consumers. This is a large reform program=
me which will need serious political will at all levels of government to im=
plement. Yet, experience has shown that nothing less will work.=20

ONGC board meet holds key to Panna Mukta operatorship, Prasanna Upadhyay

The thorny issue of the operatorship rights for the Panna Mukta Tapti oil a=
nd gas fields is coming to a head as the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (O=
NGC) board is slated to meet on Tuesday to discuss the issue threadbare. Th=
e hopes of British Gas (BG), which has decided to buy out the 30 per cent E=
nron stake in the oil fields, rests largely on the board meeting, as BG has=
 made it clear that it will go through the deal only if it gets sole operat=
orship. However, ONGC, which holds 40 per cent in the fields, and Reliance,=
 the other 30 per cent stakeholder, have both pitched for operatorship righ=
ts. Only if the ONGC board agrees to allow BG to take the rights can the de=
al be carried forward from BG's end. ONGC chairman Subir Raha could not be =
reached for comments by The Financial Express despite several attempts.

According to sources close to BG, the company is confident that ONGC would =
agree to transfer of operatorship from Enron to BG. These sources said that=
 BG would pick up Enron's stake in the oil fields, subject to transfer of o=
peratorship and till the issue was resolved the question of paying up the $=
388 million for the deal did not arise. While there is talk that Enron may =
be wanting BG to hurry up with the payment for the deal in view of Enron's =
global problems, there was no independent confirmation of this from either =
BG or from Enron. An official spokesperson of Enron in India declined to co=

operatorship otherwise it is off from our side," the sources close to BG sa=
id. While sources close to BG added that Reliance has agreed for transfer o=
f operatorship from Enron to BG, a Reliance spokesperson, when contacted, c=
ategorically denied that Reliance had given a green signal for transfer of =
the operatorship to BG.=20

While BG is confident that ONGC would agree for transfer of operatorship to=
 it, ONGC's unions have said that the oil major has enormous experience in =
the field and had also discovered the fields. According to sources, to reso=
lve the issue, the suggestion of joint venture operatorship was raised from=
 some quarters, so that all the three joint venture partners could be inclu=
ded in the operatorship. Another suggestion was that the three fields shoul=
d be distributed to the three partners. However, BG is sticking to its dema=
nd for sole operatorship. The fields produce around 300 cubic metres of gas=
 and 29,000 barrels of oil per day. Enron, which has been taken over by Dyn=
egy Inc has decided to withdraw from oil and gas in India as part of its gl=
obal strategy.=20

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

Thanks Jaime,
What I don't understand is why you wouldn't do or why you are doing the following:

-	Why are you assuming that PREPA will pay you 75% of the disputed amounts in January?  What is the basis for that - - I have seen no progress from them but I could be wrong.
-	Why wouldn't you negotiate and leave READY your LNG prepayment scheme so that you're ready to pull the trigger in case something else falls through?  If you wait until the last minute (to consider), you will have NO options.


On a separate note, I understand that a potential opportunity exists to look at buying the winter cargo spot vs from Cabot.  Gas prices are dipping down rapidly and this opportunity may be gone if Eco does not evaluate it and decide a course of action very soon.  When this was presented to me I thought it certainly had a lot of merit and it was logical for us to take a look at it immediately.  Having said that, and in keeping with my philosophy that Eco needs to step in and get used to looking at this type of stuff and to making its own decisions (driven by what's best for Eco), I recommended to the Fuel manager that this be something that Eco looks at and decides on.  Where are we on that?

Thanks, Mariella

Attached please find the daily cash tracking worksheet. Please note that among all the assumptions used to build the worksheet the following are critical:

	1. That we collect the $14 million in insurance claims on or prior to July 13th. I spoke to the insurance brokers today and we expect the money by the end of next week;
	2. The Cabot July 13th payment could change to a few days earlier or later depending on how PREPA dispatches the facility after the rotor outage;
	3. We collect in January 75% of the projected PREPA outstanding amounts in dispute, in order to pay $15 million of subordinated debt.

 << File: Cash_Needs @ 06-05-01.xls >> 

Should we not receive the insurance money this month we would consider one or both of the following two proposals as a mechanism to bring cash in:

	1. The purchase of LNG by San Juan Gas;
	2. The purchase of the fuel oil inventory by Peerless.

This week each business unit across Enron has been asked to identify the optimal structure and resources on a going forward basis.  While the review is not complete, we are close to finalizing decisions surrounding each individual business.
We ask for your continued patience and we know that may be asking a lot. 
Please take the opportunity to enjoy the time with your family at Thanksgiving and know that we are working hard on finalizing all details. No significant organizational announcements will take place next week.
Mike and Jeff

Javier,

Attached is the memo Greg was referring to. We can discuss when you want. No $ value was calculated for these potential opportunities. I would imagine that the calculations would be very complex (if possible to do at all).

I thought of 1 more type of opportunity that could arise. If U.S. natural gas prices fall from one year to the next, Eco may be better off buying spot LNG rather than buying LNG from Cabot at the contract price. We are looking at this for the Year 2002.

Paul

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like "Industry Overviews" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
"We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,"  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

Aditya Birla group pitches for picking stake in Dabhol project, Sourav Maju=
mdar & Namrata Singh=20

 The Aditya Vikram Birla group is understood to have put in a statement of =
interest for the beleaguered 2,184-mw Dabhol power project. This has create=
d a new twist to the Dabhol saga, which has been beset with uncertainties f=
rom the very beginning. The move comes close on the heels of the AV Birla g=
roup's decision last week to pick up Reliance Industries' over 10 per cent =
stake in construction and engineering major, Larsen & Toubro, for a conside=
ration of Rs 766.50 crore. Industry sources conjecture that the Birlas migh=
t also be interested in jointly bidding for an 85-per cent stake in Dabhol =
Power Company (DPC) along with the Tatas. Tata group company Tata Power has=
 already evinced a keen interest in bidding for the project, with the only =
other player in the fray being Mumbai's power utility major, BSES.=20

Tata Power and BSES have already commissioned a due diligence study as a pr=
ecursor to the bidding process. Birla group officials were unavailable for =
comment. Birla's interest in Dabhol has thrown up a fresh dimension to the =
DPC story even as it unfolds. The Birla group has a presence in the power s=
ector with Rosa Power. The 567-mw Rosa Power project is a joint venture bet=
ween the AV Birla group, which has a majority holding, and UK-based PowerGe=
n. The possibility of a joint bid along with the Tatas, if it were to happe=
n, would make this a second mega venture for the two major corporate groups=
 in India. The two groups had last year struck a mega merger deal with the =
telecom venture, Birla-AT&T-Tata. However, it is not known as to which of t=
he Birla group companies would be employed for the task of bidding for Dabh=
ol.=20

The 85 per cent stake in DPC under consideration includes the holdings of E=
nron Corporation, Bechtel Enterprises Inc. and General Electric, all US-bas=
ed companies. MSEB, which is currently waging a legal battle with DPC over =
non-payment of dues, holds a 30-per cent stake in the 740-mw phase-I of the=
 Dabhol project. The crux of the problem with the languishing project is un=
affordable tariff rates, which the promoters are currently deliberating on =
as to how this could be reduced. The 1,444-mw phase-II of the project has b=
een stalled midway. The bidding process for the stake under consideration w=
ould be critical with Enron, which was earlier demanding a price of $1.2 bi=
llion for exiting the project, agreeing to scale down the price demand by a=
lmost 30 per cent. Globally, parent Enron Corporation is being acquired by =
Houston-based Dynegy Inc. for $9 billion.=20

Venue for DPC arbitration process shifts to Singapore, Sanjay Jog=20

The arbitration proceedings initiated by the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) aga=
inst the Maharashtra government for non-payment of December bill of Rs 102 =
crore will now take place in Singapore instead of London. In view of the sh=
ifting of venue, a high-level team led by the state principal energy secret=
ary VM Lal has flown to Singapore to hold talks with the arbitration tribun=
al for deciding future timetable to take up arbitration proceedings there. =
Official sources told The Financial Express that Mr Lal is accompanied by t=
he state government solicitors Rafia Dada, Atual Harayani and Daraious Kham=
bata. The state government team would hold talks with its arbitrator Quenti=
n Loh, DPC's arbitrator Andrew John Rogers QC (formerly chief judge of the =
commercial division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales) and the arbitr=
ation tribunal head Lord Mustill. The meeting deserves special significance=
 especially when the DPC has agreed for due diligence by the Tata Power and=
 BSES after signing a separate confidentiality agreement with it.=20

This was agreed at a three-day meeting convened by the financial institutio=
ns at Singapore from November 8. Mr Lal's meeting with the arbitration trib=
unal is also crucial as the London Court through its ex-parte order of Octo=
ber 10 has restrained the state government from filing any suit in the Indi=
an courts or tribunals against the DPC. Sources said that the government th=
rough its arbitrator would make a strong plea that the arbitration proceedi=
ngs should await the outcome of the arbitration process between the DPC and=
 the MSEB in order to save both time and duplication. "This is in view of t=
he fact that the parties are the same and the disputes emanate from the sam=
e set of facts and contractual obligations of the parties and the arbitrato=
rs named by both the parties for all the three arbitrations (DPC has served=
 arbitration notices against the state government for latter's default in t=
he implementation of state support agreement, supplemental state support ag=
reement and state guarantee agreement) are the same," sources said. It must=
 be noted here that the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC=
) has already restrained the DPC on May 29 from carrying out arbitration pr=
ocess against MSEB until the issue of MERC jurisdiction to adjudicate diffe=
rences.=20

MSEB to skip DPC board meet=20

THE Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has decided against attendin=
g the board meeting of Dabhol Power Company (DPC) to be held at London on N=
ovember 30. The board will reportedly discuss issuing of the final terminat=
ion notice (FTN). According to senior MSEB officials, the board is against =
the Enron-promoted DPC's proposal to grant the company's Managing Director =
rights to issue FTN according to his discretion. DPC has yet to approach it=
s lenders for a go-ahead to issue the FTN, which will end the stint of the =
controversy-plagued 2,184-MW power company in the country. "The decision to=
 issue final termination in turn means wiping out the very existence of the=
 company. We believe that such an important decision should not be left to =
one person. The entire board of directors should vote on it,'' a senior MSE=
B official told Business Line. Another reason for the board's decision to n=
ot attend the meeting=20
is that MSEB does not have voting rights despite being a 15 per cent stakeh=
older.

The Enron scandal
Enron's root problem was in its investment activities, says A V Rajwade

Enron has always been recognised by other companies as best practice in ris=
k management. It put in systems to manage risks on a real-time basis and ha=
d very strong management." - James Lam, founder of eRisk, a consulting firm=
. As an occasional teacher and more regularly a student of the subject of m=
anagement of price risks, I have been an admirer of Enron's elaborate discl=
osure of its risk management practices. And yet, in a cascade of events ove=
r a period of just three weeks from mid-October, it lost two-thirds of its =
share value, became the subject of a US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC=
) investigation, and was taken over by a rival a third in size. (Latest rep=
orts create some doubt about whether this will go through.) What went wrong=
? No, the events had nothing to do with Dabhol. Indeed, if, for us in India=
, Enron will always be associated with the controversial power project, els=
ewhere it is likely become a case study for students of accounting, finance=
 and general management. (On second thoughts, even its Indian adventures wo=
uld make an excellent case study!)=20

But first, a recount of what happened. After announcing on October 16, with=
out much explanation or transparency, that it has taken a charge of $ 1.2 b=
illion against equity, Enron's share price started tumbling. Apparently, th=
e charge was the result of some financial transactions, and the SEC launche=
d an investigation. The chief financial officer (CFO), who was directly inv=
olved with the transactions, the company's treasurer and a couple of other =
senior officials were sacked. Perhaps most damagingly, Enron revised its ac=
counts from 1997 onwards, reducing profits by about $ 600 million and incre=
asing debt by a somewhat similar amount. As a result, Enron's credit rating=
 was downgraded. It seems the root problem was not in its basic business of=
 power and gas trading, but in its investment activities controlled by the =
CFO. These comprised private equity, and Enron's share in each of the inves=
tee companies was kept artificially below 50 per cent to avoid consolidatio=
n of accounts. To this end, outside investors were brought in and assured o=
f equity in Enron itself, should the value of the investee company(ies) fal=
l below agreed threshold(s).=20

All this was done to keep the losses in investments off-balance sheet, and =
mitigate their impact on reported profits. Many other US corporations inclu=
ding J P Morgan Chase, which had large private equity investments, have suf=
fered on this score (see World Money October 15). Enron wanted to avoid thi=
s and, last year, paid its since-dismissed CFO $ 30 million for his creativ=
e accounting genius. Incidentally, those enamoured of US GAAP and its alleg=
ed superiority over the rest of the world should note that all these gimmic=
ks were blessed by the company's auditors - one of the Big Five firms, whic=
h was paid $ 25 million as audit fees and $ 27 million for other services b=
y Enron last year. The restatement of the accounts from 1997 onwards became=
 necessary as the Enron management/board and the auditors were forced, on r=
eview, to admit that at least some of the transactions should have been on,=
 rather than off, balance sheet. Details of all the transactions in questio=
n are yet to come out, but what has come out is bad enough.=20

But this apart, a billion dollar hit for a company of the size ($ 300 billi=
on) or cash flow ($ 3 billion) of Enron is, by itself, hardly a death warra=
nt. But it turned out to be just that for Enron. Perhaps because it was too=
 arrogant? Perhaps also because its accounts lacked transparency and their =
opaqueness ensured that investors' confidence was always somewhat fragile? =
But there are two other points worth noting: the professionalism of equity =
analysts and whether the event restores somewhat the balance between tradin=
g and producing. As for the first, the professional analysts were surely aw=
are of the opaqueness of the accounts, but few questioned the management ag=
gressively on the subject.=20

Perhaps the stock was too glamorous and typified the spirit of the times - =
trading assets was what the "masters of the universe" did, not the boring o=

Hurry while stocks last
BSES and Tata Power, the two companies which are interested in buying out E=
nron's stake in the troubled Dabhol Power Company (DPC), should hurry up an=
d make their offers soon. Failing that, a consortium of financial instituti=
ons should get together to bid for the equity as a strategic investment, to=

on-based energy giant is struggling to put together credit worth $1 billion=

l, could also be in trouble. All of this means that Enron will be happy to =
see cash upfront, even at a substantial discount to the $1.1 billion valuat=
ion for DPC. Reports say that Indian FIs think $700 to $800 million is a re=
asonable price, but the payments would be staggered over five years or so. =
Given Enron's current cash crunch, it would be better to haggle for an even=
 lower price, but agree to pay all the money upfront.=20

Acquiring DPC for a fraction of its original equity value will mean that de=

 drastic haircuts - otherwise gearing will swell beyond all reasonable prop=

. That will be good news, but India should wait before declaring this a mil=

Private power producers may soon be allowed to sell electricity to non-SEB =

Enron bleeds again as Dynegy deal doubts grow=20

A long weekend of work faced Dynegy and proposed acquisition Enron, whose w=
orsening stock woes on Friday whipped up fear that the deal could be renego=
tiated or collapse entirely. Houston-based Dynegy and its advisers were exp=
ected to spend the long holiday weekend reviewing larger cross-town rival E=
nron's complex books, as both parties race against the decline in Enron's s=
tock to complete the thorough financial examinations a merger requires. Enr=
on shares ended down more than 5 per cent, or 27 cents, to $4.74 at the clo=
se of abbreviated Friday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy sha=
res closed up 64 cents, or 1.61 per cent, to $40.40.

Dynegy on November 9 agreed to pay about $9 billion in stock for Enron. But=
, after falling 45 per cent by Friday's close amid fears it could run out o=
f cash before the deal closes, Enron's market capitalization is only about =
$4.03 billion. At Dynegy's current stock price, its offer for Enron is wort=
h about $10.85 a share -- more than twice Enron's current share price. Exec=
utives and advisers from both companies are in the final stages of the revi=
ew, known as due diligence, sources familiar with the matter said. The sour=
ces said renegotiations had not been discussed as of Friday afternoon, and =
that such discussions could not occur until the due diligence review is fin=
ished. But should it turn up any more unpleasant surprises that qualify as =
a "material adverse change" in Enron's business, the likelihood increases o=
f Dynegy invoking escape clauses or renegotiating, analysts and observers s=
ay. "You've got to believe there is that possibility. There is a 90 per cen=
t spread on the deal," said one analyst. "There's unquestionably continued =
malaise in Enron's core business and Dynegy has left itself open to renegot=
iate with Enron." UBS Warburg analyst Ron Barone on Wednesday wrote in a re=
search report that the likelihood was "soaring" that Dynegy might discover =
a material adverse change. Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said that, to her =
knowledge, Dynegy was not renegotiating the terms of the acquisition. She r=
epeated that Enron was working on obtaining an additional $500 million to $=
1 billion in private equity funding to help shore up the balance sheet. Dyn=
egy spokesman John Sousa said due diligence was continuing and said the com=
pany remains optimistic about the merger.

TRADERS FEARING RENEGOTIATION

Enron's recent admission that lower volumes at its trading business -- the =
crown jewel of Enron that Dynegy most covets -- could cause low fourth-quar=
ter earnings raises the possibility that the trading business is losing its=
 profitability. Continued losses there would remove a key attraction for Dy=
negy. Electricity traders said the latest developments are making it seem m=
ore likely that Dynegy will renegotiate the deal or back out entirely, a mo=
ve they said would leave Enron vulnerable to creditors and a possible bankr=
uptcy. This week rating agency Fitch Investors said that if Dynegy stepped =
away from the merger, Enron's credit situation seemed untenable and a bankr=
uptcy filing was highly possible. Traders, speaking on condition on anonymi=
ty, said they expected Dynegy to scramble over the weekend to narrow the gr=
owing share price gap. Enron's depleted market value and the shrinking volu=
me in its EnronOnline trading system makes it more likely Dynegy could pull=
 out, traders said.

Meanwhile, energy traders reiterated that they would shy away from long-ter=
m deals with Enron unless they received substantial assurances the company'=
s credit rating would soon improve. Enron's bonds on Friday were again talk=
ed at junk-bond levels, but even lower than before. Enron's 6.4 per cent no=
tes maturing in 2006 and its 6.75 per cent notes were bid Friday at 57 cent=
s on the dollar, down from a respective 62 and 60 cents on Wednesday, accor=
ding to a trader. The notes yield to maturity a respective 21.5 per cent an=
d 17 per cent. Its 20-year zero-coupon convertible bonds fell about 1 cent =
on the dollar to just over 33 cents.

Enron is hovering at the edge of investment-grade as the three main credit =
trading agencies consider whether to cut them again, and some observers won=
der how Enron has avoided it. "A bond trading in the 50s has nothing to do =
with an investment-grade security," said Scott Smith, a principal at Wells =

Enron avoids junk status, NEW YORK

It is rare that holding onto investment-grade credit ratings means as much =
to a company as it does now to beleaguered energy trader Enron, and some ob=
servers are wondering why a cut to junk status is taking so long. "The sum =
of all knowledge is in the valuation of the stock and the bonds," said Scot=
t Smith, a principal at Wells Capital Management in San Francisco, where he=
 invests $6 billion in debt, and does not own Enron. "A bond trading in the=
 50s has nothing to do with an investment-grade security." Enron's 6.4 per =
cent notes maturing in 2006 and 6.75 per cent notes were bid Friday at 57 c=
ents on the dollar, down from a respective 62 and 60 cents on Wednesday, a =
trader said. The notes yield to maturity 21.5 per cent and 17 per cent.

Meanwhile, Enron's shares have sunk 94 per cent this year. Since October 16=
, when it released third-quarter results, which it has since revised downwa=
rd, its shares have fallen 86 per cent, and its bonds by nearly half. Houst=
on-based Enron, which is trying to merge with smaller cross-town rival Dyne=
gy, has been rocked this year by accounting problems, earnings restatements=
, a federal investigation and a top management shuffle. Its advisers were e=
xpected this weekend to pore over the company's books, which could lead to =
a renegotiation of the merger, sources familiar with the matter said. Moody=
's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have cut its senior unsecured de=
bt ratings twice in the last month to their current Baa3" and "BBB-minus," =
their lowest investment grades. Fitch has cut its equivalent rating to "BBB=
-minus," and all three agencies have warned of more possible cuts.

The stakes could hardly be higher.=20

A downgrade to "junk" status could imperil Enron's trading business, force =
it to pay off as much as $3.9 billion of debt issued mostly by two trusts, =
and possibly force it to seek bankruptcy protection, analysts said. Enron s=
aid in a securities filing it recently had less than $2 billion of availabl=
e cash and credit lines. S&P said on Tuesday that Enron faces "liquidity is=
sues," but enjoys an "alignment of interests" with its banks and a near-ter=
m financial position that "is expected to be sufficient" to allow the Dyneg=
y merger. Fitch, meanwhile, said on Wednesday that "our present 'BBB-minus'=
 rating rests on the merger possibility and continued support of the lendin=
g banks." If Dynegy walks away, it said, "Enron's credit situation seems un=
tenable with a bankruptcy filing highly possible."

Enron said on Monday it had $9.15 billion of obligations due through next y=
ear, and a $690 million note that could come due next Tuesday. It later sai=
d it got a three-week reprieve. Sean Egan, managing director of Egan-Jones =
Ratings in Philadelphia, likened Enron's ratings situation to those of Cali=
fornia's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern Califor=
nia Edison . Despite investor unease, those utilities kept their investment=
-grade ratings only until they defaulted on debt in January, as California'=
s power crisis worsened. On November 8, a day before the Dynegy merger was =
announced, senior officials from Enron's lead banks -- William Harrison, ch=
ief executive of J.P. Morgan Chase, and Michael Carpenter, who runs Citigro=
up's investment banking arm -- met with Moody's to help allay that agency's=
 concerns, a person familiar with the meeting said.=20

A day later, Moody's, which issued no statement on Enron this week, downgra=
ded the company's senior unsecured debt rating, but only to its current "Ba=
a3." "Pressure is coming from the investment banks, which have a vested int=
erest in seeing the Dynegy deal go through," said Egan, whose agency rates =
Enron's debt "BB," its second-highest junk grade. "Investment banking fees =
will be substantial." Companies pay for Moody's and S&P ratings, which they=
 need to obtain financing. Egan said his agency receives no such payments. =
Citigroup and JP Morgan declined to comment. Moody's and S&P did not immedi=
ately return phone calls. Fitch was not immediately available for comment. =
Dynegy and Enron on Wednesday, however, reaffirmed their commitment to the =
merger. Wells Capital's Smith isn't sure what to expect. "Enron will remain=
 definitively investment grade if the merger as billed goes through, but th=
ere are half a dozen things that could go wrong," he said. "Obviously, the =
equity markets are telling you it's very skeptical the merger will go throu=

Devil in the details, Devangshu datta=20

Looking at the market now, it's almost as though September 11 never happene=
d. The indices are back above September 12 trading levels,local investors a=
re trading enthusiastically, volume and price recovery is evident across th=
e board. Maybe this is because Kabul has fallen and Kandahar is within a we=
ek of collapse. But the USSR had control of every Afghan population centre =
within 24 hours of the 1979 airlift invasion. It already had a puppet regim=
e in place. The Red Army withdrew after eight more years of bitter fighting=
 and 35,000 casualties! It would thus take a historical ignoramus to assume=
 that this war will end with the capture of Kandahar. Other signals are eve=
n more disquieting. Every FII appears to be in the process of either pullin=
g out totally or cutting back on its Indian presence. There could be severa=
l reasons. The US slowdown has been cited, so has Enron. Whatever the reaso=
ns, it is an amazing turnaround of sentiment, given that 2001 began with th=
e FIIs pumping in money. There could be pressure on Indian reserves in the =
next fiscal and that could have prompted the currency downgrade. The market=
 revival is a little puzzling when one examines details. ICE stocks that ha=
ve delivered poor Q2 results have moved up sharply whereas ICE stocks that =
have delivered decent results have not. There are strong rumours that opera=
tors are trying to ramp up prices, lure in smalltimers and offload the K-10=
 stocks they've held since March.=20

Old economy movements could more credibly be ascribed to value-buying. But =
even here, a lot of action is based on rumour mongering. Some MNC is about =
to make an open offer, somebody else is going to divest a loss making divis=
ion. That sort of thing seems a little pronounced at the moment. Undoubtedl=
y there are value-based buys available. But value based buying requires the=
 strictest adherence to discipline and it's interesting to apply standard p=
arameters to the market as a whole. The Nifty is trading at a price-earning=
s ratio of 14 plus, it has a price book value ratio of 2.25 and a dividend =
yield of 1.6 per cent at current rates. This is an economy where returns of=
 approximately 6.7 per cent are safely available from short-term debt and i=
nflation is around 5.5 per cent to 6 per cent. Long term debt returns range=
 up to about 11 per cent for the savvy trader and around 9.5 per cent for t=
he passive investor.=20

A value investor would thus look to see if his projections suggested the fo=
llowing: First that EPS growth will beat at least 15 per cent, second that =
the P-BV is historically low and returns from capital gains plus dividend y=
ield would beat 15 per cent over the next year. Assuming constant inflation=
, and adjusting for dividend, the Nifty would have to improve by 12 per cen=
t to 15 per cent to meet the capital gains target. Overall EPS growth beati=
ng 15 per cent looks doubtful. P-BV is on the low side. A further index imp=
rovement of 15 per cent also looks a stretch. Broad-based buying thus seems=
 a 50-50 shot unless the investor waits much longer.=20

Enron staff sue as pension savings evaporate=20

AFTER climbing utility poles in all kinds of weather for 35 years, Roy Rina=

 Enron's stock price devoured his retirement savings. "I'm basically wiped =
out," said Rinard, 54, who works for Portland General Electric, an Oregon u=
tility company acquired by the Houston-based energy trading giant in 1997. =
"I'm right back to ground zero and I'll have to go on working as long as I =
can," said Rinard, who suffers from arthritis and a lung condition that lea=
ves him short of breath. Encouraged by Enron's then-strong performance and =
the company's bullish view of its future prospects, Rinard moved all of the=
 money invested in his 401(k) retirement account into Enron stock earlier t=
his year.But it proved to be a costly decision as the value of his account =
fell from $470,000 a year ago to around $40,000 today. Rinard now hopes a l=
awsuit filed in US District Court in Houston will recover at least some of =
his money. The suit, filed on behalf of Enron employees by Seattle-based la=
w firm Hagens Berman, alleges that Enron breached its fiduciary duty by enc=
ouraging its employees to invest heavily in Enron stock without warning the=
m of the risks of doing so.

Enron's stock, which peaked at $90 in August 2000, closed at $4.74 on Frida=
y, after falling sharply in recent weeks amid a series of damaging financia=
l disclosures. A broadly similar suit filed by the Keller Rohrback law firm=
, also Seattle based, alleges that another Enron employee, Pamela Tittle, l=
ost $140,000 on Enron stock held in her retirement account. According to th=
at suit, the Enron retirement savings plan had assets worth $2.1 billion at=
 the end of last year, including $1.3 billion, or 62 per cent of the total,=
 in Enron stock.

DOUBTS EMERGE ABOUT DYNEGY DEAL

Enron, a former Wall Street favorite, agreed to be bought out earlier this =
month by smaller energy trading rival Dynegy Inc., but continuing problems =
at Enron have caused some analysts to question whether the deal will be com=
pleted. Doubts have also been expressed about a planned sale of Portland Ge=
neral to Northwest Natural Gas. Hagens Berman plans to seek class-action st=
atus for its suit and says 21,000 Enron employees could be eligible to join=
 it. The suit alleges that Enron "locked down" 401(k) retirement accounts o=
n October 17, preventing employees from changing the investments they held =
in their accounts until November 19.

During that period Enron reported its first quarterly loss in four years an=
d took a charge of $1.2 billion against stockholders' equity as a result of=
 off-balance-sheet deals that would later come under investigation by US re=
gulators. In that time, Enron shares fell from $30.72 at the close of tradi=
ng October 16 to $11.69 on November 19. Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said =
employees' access to the accounts was blocked as part of a previously plann=
ed change in the administration of the retirement plan and that the measure=
 was in effect from October 26. to November 19.Steve Lacey, a 45-year-old e=
mergency repair dispatcher who has worked for Portland General Electric for=
 21 years, said the measure came at a time when bad news about Enron was fl=
ying thick and fast, driving the stock price down at a dizzying pace. "We c=
ouldn't take our money out of Enron stock into another portfolio. Basically=
 they had us locked down to where we had no say over our own future," he sa=
id.

Lacey declined to quantify his own losses but said he and many of his colle=
agues had invested most of their retirement funds in Enron stock because it=
 had performed better in the past than the other investments available unde=
r the Enron plan. Denne said Enron employees were normally able to choose a=
mong 18 different investment options, but Enron's matching contributions we=
re always made in the form of its own stock. Lacey said he felt sorry for o=
lder colleagues at Portland General who had suffered a heavy financial blow=
 just before they were due to retire, adding that he was only beginning to =
realize how serious the consequences could be for himself. "My goal was to =
have an extremely comfortable retirement and that may be a little clouded n=

The Pune-based non-governmental organisation (NGO) Prayas alongwith Mumbai =
Grahak Panchayat, Mahratta Chamber of Commerce and Akhil Bharatiya Grahak P=
anchayat have jointly appealed to the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Co=
mmission (Merc) that the Maharashtra government should not be accorded spec=
ial privileges and its role in the determination of tariff of Maharashtra S=
tate Electricity Board (MSEB) should be limited. These organisations have p=
ointed out that unless the state government was prepared to compensate MSEB=
 in the manner determined by Merc, it has no authority to interfere in the =
tariff determination process. "Though under section 39 of the Electricity R=
egulatory Commission Act (ERCA), the state government has the authority to =
issue policy directives to the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (Ser=
c), section 29 clearly specifies that the Serc has to determine the tariff =
and also specifies certain guidelines for the same," organisation said. The=

These organisations have expressed surprise over the state government's sub=
mission that there was a difference between the government and MSEB. They h=
ave also questioned the state government's request that the Merc should tak=
e an appropriate steps in order to ensure agreement between state governmen=
t and MSEB. These organisations, also, have made it clear that the tariff d=
etermination was under the exclusive domain of Merc and it has to give an o=
rder based only on the evidence that comes before it through various affida=
vits and submissions. "The ERCA does not allow any other role or mechanism =
for Merc or any other party in the context of tariff revision. As such, we =
request Merc from taking any steps to help MSEB and the state government re=
ach an agreement. This aspect be left to the state government and MSEB," th=

Maharashtra may have to pay Rs 60000 crore to MSEB: Godbole=20

Maharashtra may have to pay a whopping Rs 60,000 crore to the Maharashtra S=
tate Electricity Board (MSEB) if it fails to resolve the Enron imbroglio am=
icably, Madhav Godbole, chairman of the energy review committee, has said. =
Godbole blamed the inefficiencies of state-run undertakings for the Enron c=
risis and said the only way to avoid a recurrence was to privatise MSEB. Po=
liticians and the employees' union would oppose privatisation of MSEB, but =
its dismal performance and growing transmission and distribution losses hav=
e left little option but to go for privatisation in a phased manner, Godbol=
e said. He urged the people to mount pressure on the state government on th=
e issue and stressed it was necessary to avoid such disasters.=20

Delivering the second E F Schumacher memorial lecture here, instituted by N=
agpur University in association with Dr Padmakar Sapre, Godbole painted a v=
ery gloomy picture of Maharashtra's economy, noting that the state was on t=
he verge of bankruptcy owing to "suicidal policies followed by successive g=
overnments." Speaking on 'financial management of Maharashtra: problems and=
 perspectives,' Godbole stressed the need to introduce stringent policies t=
o get over the messy financial situation. He advocated re-introduction of z=
ero-based budgeting and fixing priority, so as to curb unnecessary expendit=
ure. Godbole said, despite ten years of economic liberalisation, very littl=
e has changed. Fiscal deficit in 1990-91 was 9.49 per cent, and it remains =
where it was. Revenue deficit had gone up from 4.2 per cent to 6.2 per cent=
 in 2000-2001.=20

The public sector savings have touched an all-time low of 1.2 per cent and =
consumption expenditure was on the rise. Godbole pointed out that 58 per ce=
nt of the state budget was spent on wages and 23 per cent on payment of int=
erest leaving very little for capital investment. He claimed that Maharasht=
ra was doling out Rs 18,000 crore as subsidies under various heads and has =
become the highest subsidy-providing state in the country. When Central ass=
istance was dwindling due to the new formula of allocation from a Central p=
ool, states such as Maharashtra would receive a lesser share in coming year=
s, he said.=20

He came down heavily on the misuse of state funds by co-operative societies=
 and charged that a promoter had to invest only 2 per cent amount while the=
 rest was made good by the state government. Heavy spending on higher educa=
tion must be stopped forthwith, he said, adding that the society must learn=
 to take care of such sectors by itself without burdening the state. The mo=
ney thus saved should instead be diverted towards primary education, he sai=
d. Godbole pointed out that the annual budget was irrelevant because of inc=
reasing off-budget transactions, which were out of public scrutiny. He said=
, due to overall mismanagement, the state government was forced to resort t=
o go for overdrafts for a period of 37 days in 2000-2001.=20

Godbole said populist schemes such as the monopoly cotton procurement schem=
e (MCPS) had no place in a globalised economy and its rising losses were a =
matter of great worry. He criticised the state government for delinking cot=
ton price from the prevailing market price and stated that the basic purpos=
e behind MCPS had been lost in the race for reaping electoral gains. Godbol=
e strongly advocate enactment of a 'Budgetary and Financial State Managemen=
t Act' to check unnecessary expenditure and fiscal discipline. He criticise=
d the state government for extending loan counter-guarantees to various und=
ertakings under its control.=20

Till date, the state government had extended counter-guarantees for loans w=
orth Rs 2.34 lakh crore, he said. "This was done when the total annual rece=
ipts of the state were merely Rs 35,000 crore," he said. Godbole advocated =
downsizing of the government and a ban on fresh recruitment. An attractive =
voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) should be offered to employees and contra=
ct-system be introduced, he said. He also supported the concept of contribu=
tory pension for employees and pointed out that under the present scheme, t=
he state government was burdened with paying a sum of Rs. 2600 crore to fiv=
e lakh pensioners. A state expenditure commission must be set up immediatel=
y for reviewing of expenses incurred by the state on permanent basis, Godbo=
le suggested. Nagpur University vice-chancellor Arun Satputaley presided ov=
er the function.=20

THE ASIAN AGE, Saturday, November 24, 2001
BJP loan costs state Rs 6,000 cr, Olga Tellis=20
Maharashtra is still reeling financially from the three major actions of it=
s predecessor government. One, it ran up debts of Rs 40,000 crores in five =
years; two, it formally permitted the second phase of the Dabhol power proj=
ect after declaring that it would throw Dabhol Phase 1 into the Arabian Sea=
; and three, it hurriedly announced the implementation of the Fifth Pay Com=
mission award. Maharashtra is paying Rs 6,000 crores in annual interest on =
bonds and loans that the predecessor Sena-BJP government accumulated during=
 its five-year rule. Senior Congressman and Cabinet minister for labour Sat=
ish Chaturvedi said the Congress ruled the state for 35 of the 41 years tha=
t the state has been in existence. During these 35 years, the total debt bu=
ilt up by Congress governments was about Rs 15,000 crores. As against this,=
 the Sena-BJP in five years borrowed merrily and issued bonds for approxima=
tely Rs 45,000 crores. So its successor Democratic Front government, led by=
 the Sonia Gandhi and Sharad Pawar Congress respectively, is paying a cripp=
ling Rs 6,000 crores interest annually within specified time limits. Speaki=
ng to The Asian Age, Mr Chaturvedi said that at stake is more than Maharash=
tra's prestige as the favoured industrial destination of the country for th=
e rest of the world because, if the state falls back on its interest paymen=
ts, it will also restrict its capacity to borrow.=20

Maharashtra's annual budget is Rs 16,000 crores. Out of this, Rs 6,000 cror=
es goes straight away as interest payment. The second burden left behind by=
 the Sena-BJP is the permission given to Enron to go ahead with phase two o=
f the Dabhol power project, besides increasing the total capacity of the pl=
ant. This phase two will impose an annual encumbrance of Rs 6,000 crores, w=
hether or not the state uses the power. The state, as the senior minister s=
ays, "absolutely cannot survive this financial burden that will be imposed =
when phase two of Dabhol comes on stream." The state does not want the proj=
ect but the financial institutions led by IDBI, who are caught in a trap, w=
ould want the project to be completed so they don't have any liabilities th=
at will arise with the lenders if the project is scrapped. IDBI has stood g=
uarantee for Rs 5,500 crores. Additionally, if the state loses the arbitrat=
ion proceedings currently on in London, the claims on it will be around Rs =
500 crores.=20

The third and equally devastating financial burden is the acceptance of the=
 Fifth Pay Commission award which the Sena-BJP government announced shortly=
 before its term ended. Paying just 50 per cent of the DA has cost the gove=
rnment around Rs 250 crores to Rs 300 crores. The government has not paid t=
he workers' bonus as it would have cost Rs 750 crores and this does not inc=
lude the pensions, which would run into several hundred crores. Maharashtra=
 is among the three states that have accepted the Fifth Pay Commission, the=
 others being Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. The state also has a problem meeting =
commitments given to cotton growers who dominate the Vidarbha region. The l=
oss to the government in the monopoly purchase of cotton is said to be arou=
nd Rs 800 crores.=20

The Centre has announced a support price of Rs 1,800 per quintal while the =
state is committed to purchase cotton at Rs 2,300 per quintal. The price of=
 cotton in the market is Rs 1,400 for imported cotton. There are about 22-l=
akh to 23-lakh bales of cotton lying in the market yard. If the government =
disposes of this cotton at the market price, it will lose Rs 350 crores. So=
 the government has to arrange for Rs 3,500 crores for the cotton monopoly =
scheme. The state is also in a Catch-22 situation as far as the state-run t=
extile mills are concerned. The government is currently spending Rs 20 lakh=
s per day running nine textile mills. Two mills out of these have now been =
shut and the workers given VRS, which cost the government around Rs 20 cror=
es to Rs 30 crores. If they are to close down the seven others, they will h=
ave to arrange finance of Rs 250 crores. So their dilemma is whether to con=
tinue to pay Rs 20 lakhs a day or get this lumpsum of Rs 250 crores and clo=
se the mills at one go.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Maharashtra cautioned on Dabhol stand-off

THE financial standing of the Maharashtra Government would be certainly imp=
aired if the power purchase agreement (PPA) between Dabhol Power Company an=
d the State Electricity Board is not successfully renegotiated, according t=
o rating agency CARE. Commenting on the State finances while rating a Rs 60=
0-crore bond issue of the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporatio=
n (MKVDC), CARE said fiscal reforms assume greater urgency because the cred=
it quality of the State would be impacted if there is a devolution of liabi=
lities guaranteed by it in the PPA. Ballpark estimates place the size of th=
e States' immediate liabilities at Rs 17,000 crore. If the worst case scena=
rio is realised, the Government's liquidity position and financial flexibil=
ity will be acutely impaired.=20

However, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), to which the asset=
s would stand transferred if the State decides to take over the project, wi=
ll have the option of inviting third parties to participate in the venture =
minimising the State's liabilities. A CARE official said even if a third pa=
rty is involved in the project, the State would have to take a sizeable hit=
 on capital employed. He put the loss burden on Maharashtra at around Rs 8,=
000-9,000 crore. CARE said the guarantees given by the Government to its sp=
ecial purpose vehicles' borrowings have risen substantially. The total outs=
tanding liabilities of Maharashtra as a proportion of the net State domesti=
c product have increased to 29.1 per cent (estimated) in 2000-01 from 19 pe=
r cent in 1996- 97.The State's financial position calls for fiscal consolid=
ation through improvement in revenue performance and restructuring of expen=
diture, it said. Meanwhile, the agency has assigned a rating of A+(SO) to t=
he MKVDC issue. The long-term taxable bonds have a bullet payment at the en=
d of 10 years. MKVDC has, so far, raised about Rs 1,100 crores in debt issu=
es. This is the first issue in the current year.

ICRA downgrades MSEB over Dabhol fracas

Rating agency ICRA has downgraded the rating assigned to Maharashtra State =
Electricity Board's (MSEB's) bond programmes aggregating to Rs 2,015 crore,=
 from 'LAA-' (SO) to 'LA+' (SO). The rating has been placed under rating wa=
tch. "The revised rating indicates adequate safety. The rating is based on =
the unconditional and irrevocable guarantee by Government of Maharashtra (G=
oM)," ICRA said. The revised rating reflects the continued uncertainty on t=
he timing and likely manner of settlement of MSEB's payment dispute with Da=
bhol Power Company (DPC), and its impact on the financial position of MSEB =
and GoM. Though MSEB had stopped making payments to DPC, the latter had bee=
n sending monthly bills to the board. DPC had recently sent the August and =
September bills totalling Rs 209 crore. It had sent the bill arguing that t=
he capacity payments will accrue every month. The downgrade has come at a t=
ime when the High Court decided to hear from December 11 a petition filed b=
y DPC challenging the jurisdiction of Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Co=
mmission (MERC) to adjudicate its dispute with MSEB. ICRA has revised the r=
ating asigned to the Rs 150 crore non-convertible debenture programme of Ji=
ndal Iron & Steel Company Limited (JISCO) to LA- (SO) from LAA- (SO). The r=
ating has been placed under 'Rating Watch'. The revised rating indicates ad=

'SCI can invest more in Greenfield', P. Manoj=20

THE Shipping Ministry has no reservations on Shipping Corporation of India =
(SCI) investing another $11 million as its share to bridge the $55-million =
gap in the project cost of Greenfield Shipping Company. With less than a mo=
nth left to take possession of the LNG tanker on the scheduled delivery dat=
e of November 15, the board of SCI has not been able to take a final view o=
n sinking a further $11 million in proportion to its equity holding of 20 p=
er cent in the joint venture consortium. Professional members on the board =
of SCI are not convinced by the arguments put forward by the company manage=
ment on investing an extra $11 million and save the project from going into=
 payment default..

These members have counter-argued that the project has turned unviable due =
to the uncertainty surrounding the Dabhol Power Company (DPC), making the p=
rospect of earning the original charter hire rate of $98,600 per day look b=
leak. The Shipping Ministry, which controls the SCI, feels that the State-o=
wned company has no other option but to invest the additional amount of $11=
 million and bail out the tanker from the clutches of the lenders. ``The SC=
I has two worst choices before it. One is to pump in another $11 million to=
 save the project from going into default and earn a return of 4 to 5 per c=
ent. The second option is to refuse further investment and earn no returns =
at all besides running the risk of losing its equity investment of $11 mill=
ion. The SCI will have to make the best of the two worst choices,'' Governm=
ent sources told Business Line.=20

While the SCI will not invest the extra $11 million immediately, it is plan=
ning to issue a letter of comfort to Mitsui O.S.K.Lines, the lead partner i=
n the consortium, stating that it was prepared to accept the liability in f=
uture. This will pave the way for Mitsui to put in the entire $55 million t=
o bridge the gap in project cost and proceed with taking delivery of the LN=
G carrier. The amount given by Mitsui towards the share of the other two pa=
rtners totalling $22 million ($11 million each for SCI and Atlantic Commerc=
ial Inc) will be in the form of a loan. In future, this amount will have to=
 be reimbursed to Mitsui with interest. The Shipping Ministry feels that al=
lowing bankers to confiscate the LNG vessel due to non-payment of the last =
tranche of project cost of $55 million would render SCI's equity investment=
 of $11 million infructuous. On confiscation of the vessel, the bankers wou=
ld immediately go about selling the vessel for recovering its investment of=
 $110 million alongwith interest which otherwise would have been paid by th=
e promoters over a period of time. ``Significantly, when you approach the m=
arket for selling a confiscated vessel, you won't even get the prevailing m=
arket price and would have to go for a distress sale,'' the sources said.=
=20

So, for an LNG tanker ordered for $220 million, the bankers would not be ab=
le to realise even the prevailing price for new buildings which is hovering=
 at around $160 to $170 million. Consequently, the bankers will recover the=
ir loan liability of $110 million with interest but the balance would be in=
sufficient for the three promoters to recoup their equity investment in ful=
l. ``Given this scenario, there is no point in looking at whether the extra=
 investment of the SCI would fetch the mandatory 12 per cent internal rate =
of return as stipulated by the Government for projects involving State-fund=
ing,'' the sources said. After providing $110 million for the project out o=
f a total loan commitment of $165 million, the bankers led by ANZ Investmen=
t Bank had suspended the last tranche of the project loan of $55 million, d=
eclaring an event of default due to the controversy surrounding the project=
. The promoters of Greenfield Shipping Company can now take possession of t=
he tanker only on paying the remaining $55 million. The tanker is being bui=
lt to ferry LNG from Oman to DPC.=20

US energy major Enron, which has decided to quit India after facing trouble=

Deshmukh Govt. completes a difficult two years, Mahesh Vijapurkar=20

To the Maharashtra Chief Minister, Mr. Vilasrao Deshmukh, two years of runn=
ing an eight-party coalition, despite a numerically strong over-anxious Opp=
osition snipping at his heels, is in itself an achievement. The arrangement=
, in which the Congress(I) and the NCP are major partners, completes two ye=
ars in office today. The key constituents of the Democratic Front (DF) had =
actually begun to show strains of running a coalition. At one point, the NC=
P, despite its mature leadership, dissociated itself from a Cabinet decisio=
n on the sensitive issue of setting up a probe against the Enron deal. To i=
t, the timing was inappropriate. The Congress(I) couldn't hide its glee at =
the Government's discomfiture.=20

The Congress(I) too is not averse to backing out from decisions. It agreed =
to the move to reconsider enforcing higher rates for water - irrigation, dr=
inking, industrial and when water is a raw material, as in mineral water pr=
oduction - at the coordination committee meeting of all ruling parties, bec=
ause of pressure from within and from the NCP. The NCP and the Congress(I) =
are aware of the limitations of coalition politics and would like to be in =
the driver's seat. The two have often said it was their duty to form a part=
nership to keep the BJP-Shiv Sena out of power. Or else, the State would ha=
ve seen the saffron parties consolidate. Battling such odds is tough for al=
l players, each with its own agenda on which they are unwilling to compromi=
se. The Opposition scorns at the Government. Says Mr. Gopinath Munde, BJP l=
eader: ``How can a Government backtrack on decisions like these? Can such a=
 Government be considered credible? I think it is all in poor taste. Disown=
ing collective responsibility is unconstitutional. I am saddened at this si=
tuation. This is no Government.''=20

Mr. Deshmukh says the Government is trying to limit the damage done to the =
State's finances by the predecessor dispensation of the BJP and the Shiv Se=
na. Once it became known that the Government was almost bankrupt, investmen=
t arrivals ceased. There has been no major investment for two years. To its=
 credit, the Government has taken some brave decisions in two years: not pa=
ying bonus to Government employees whose salary accounts for Rs. 1,300 cror=
es, cutting DA, banning the SIMI despite a coalition partner's objections a=
nd not budging when Enron rattled its sabre and, in fact, ceasing to buy po=
wer from it. But, unfortunately, it is the inter-party rivalry that draws t=
he attention of the newspapers.

Many of you have requested more time in which to submit your nominations for the 2001 Chairman's Award. In response to your requests, the deadline has been extended to Friday, October 12.

Please take this extended opportunity to nominate that special individual who is your everyday hero and a role model who exemplifies Enron's core values of Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence.

This award represents how important Enron's core values are to the company. The success of this award program is determined by Enron's most valuable asset, you, the employee. Employees at any level can nominate fellow employees from anywhere within the Enron family - from the top down or the bottom up. All of those employees who have been nominated in the past are eligible to be nominated again this year and there is no limit to the number of nominations you may submit. Simply complete a nomination form and submit it by Friday, October 12, 2001. Forms can be obtained by visiting your intranet site or at home.enron.com and in Houston they are available in the elevator lobbies. In addition, this year we have a new way you can nominate that everyday Enron hero. Simply pick up the phone and dial 713-345-2492, follow the simple and quick instructions and leave your nomination by phone.

The finalists for the award, the Chairman's Roundtable, and the Chairman's Award winner will be honored at Enron's Management Conference in San Antonio on November 15.

Thank you for your participation.

 procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

A survival kit for Tata Power, BSES, S Ravindran Mumbai=20

The two domestic power biggies_Tata Power and BSES_are vying for Enron's 65=
 per cent stake in the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) in what seems like a crit=
ical battle for survival for both. Tata Power, it appears, has two primary =
reasons to bid for Dabhol Power: one, it gets a ready built plant when all =
its other projects are on paper; two, it also pre-empts arch rival BSES. Th=
is is the more important issue, for if BSES gets DPC, it will stop lifting =
500 mw of power from Tata Power. For the latter, this could be tragic since=
 it cannot possibly find a buyer for the excess power in the vicinity, espe=
cially since the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) says it has eno=
ugh generation capacity of its own.=20

BSES, on the other hand, apart from dealing a severe blow to Tata Power, ma=
y also be able take a relook at several of the other contentious projects o=
n hand. "If BSES were to gain control of the 2,184 mw power project, it wou=
ld source the required 500 mw power from this project and stop buying it fr=
om the Tatas. Already, after BSES set up the 500 mw Dahanu power plant in M=
aharashtra, it has been buying consistently less power from the Tatas," say=
 independent observers in the power industry. But a senior Tata executive d=
efends the company's position. "Our power plants have been built through Wo=
rld Bank funding which has been guaranteed by the Union government. Under t=
hese circumstances, power would have to be evacuated till the loans are rep=
aid. We have time till 2014 when our licence expires," he said. But gaining=
 control of DPC is hardly a simple issue. Urmik Chhaya, power analyst at Ko=
tak Securities says: "Any company which takes over this project will have t=
o raise huge funds. How are they going to do that? The other question is wh=
ere will they sell the power and what will be the payment security mechanis=
m? These are the fundamental questions that will have to be addressed befor=
e any takeover of the project can be contemplated."=20

But Chhaya points out that DPC will be crucial to Tata Power's overall game=
plan. "After next year, how does Tata Power grow its power business?" One e=
stimate has it that anyone wanting to take over the power project will have=
 to pay a minimum of $700 million. "Assuming both companies bid at this res=
erve price, even at an exchange rate of Rs 47.50 to the dollar, they will h=
ave to pay Rs 3,325 crore. This is around 50 per cent of Tata Power's balan=
ce sheet size of Rs 6,465.95 crore and around 75 per cent of BSES's balance=
 sheet size of Rs 4,327.40 crore. How will these two companies raise the mo=
ney?" says an analyst.=20

However, a senior BSES executive points out that the company has a low gear=
ing with a debt-equity ratio of 0.25:1. "Raising Rs 2,000 crore at short no=
tice is no problem at all. After all, what is the use of such a low debt-eq=
uity ratio otherwise," this executive asks. Tata group sources also say tha=
t raising finance is the least of their worries. "We are the country's larg=
est independent power producer with an installed generation capacity of ove=
r 2,000 mw. We can always raise money on the strength of our balance sheet,=
" say Tata group executives. However, a change in management control at DPC=
 will have to be accompanied by a series of legislative changes. First, if =
the new owner is not allowed to sell power outside Maharashtra, the project=
 is unlikely to make any sense for the buyer. Particularly, as the state go=
vernment has made it clear that it can absorb only 740 mw of the proposed 2=
,184 mw installed capacity. This will mean giving the Dabhol project a mega=
-power status. This is far from easy as this will need an amendment by Parl=
iament as the project was not set up through the competitive bidding route =
but through a memorandum of understanding.=20

HC restrains Centre from encashing guarantees=20

In an ad-interim order, Mumbai High Court has restrained the Centre and cus=
toms authorities from encashing guarantees undertaken by State Bank of Indi=
a in regard to customs duty payable by Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Corporat=
ion for importing equipment to build liquified petroleum gas terminal in it=
s Dabhol plant. The ex-parte injunction was granted by Justice D G Karnik o=
n November 15 on a petition filed by DPC challenging the showcause notice i=
ssued by customs authorities asking the company to pay Rs 245 crore as impo=
rt duty on the equipment. The Court also restrained the SBI to make payment=
 under the guarantees undertaken by it on behalf of DPC. The Judge, however=
, allowed DPC to file an appeal before customs, excise and gold appellate t=
ribunal within a period of four weeks from the date of his order. He also r=
uled that the ex-parte injunction order shall automatically stand vacated f=
rom December 15 subject to the orders that may be passed by the tribunal. M=

THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Monday, November 19, 2001
DPC cancels Houston board meet, Sanjay Jog=20

The Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which is yet to recover from=
 the shock following its acquisition by Dynegy last week, has cancelled its=
 board meeting scheduled for November 19. The DPC board, which consists of =
two directors from the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and one r=
epresenting the state government, was to meet on Monday at Houston to deleg=
ate necessary powers to the Enron India managing director K Wade Cline for =
issuing a final termination notice to the MSEB. The DPC company secretary, =
in a faxed communication, has informed the MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal and t=
he state principal energy secretary Vinay Mohan Lal that the board meeting =
slated for Monday has been cancelled until further announcement.=20

Curiously, the DPC communication is silent over the reason for the cancella=
tion of the November 19 meeting. Mr Bansal told The Financial Express on Su=
nday, "I have been intimated by the DPC that November 19 meeting has been c=
ancelled." When contacted, DPC spokesman Jimmy Mogal declined to comment. M=
SEB, which holds 30 per cent stakes in the Dabhol phase-I (740 mw) in its l=
etter of November 12 had asked the DPC not to hold a board meeting on Novem=
ber 19 in view of the Mumbai High Court restraining the DPC from issuing a =
final termination notice until further orders. The High Court in its judgem=
ent delivered on November 9 over a civil suit filed by the Indian financial=
 institutions (IFIs) has slated the next hearing on December 3.=20

Analysts said that the DPC's decision to cancel the November 19 meeting was=
 quite expected as the company was aware that the situation in the wake of =
Enron's aquisition by Dynegy was fluid and it would need some time to take =
stock of the situation. Further, the Mumbai High Court's order, which gave =
a much-needed repreive to the MSEB as well as IFIs, came as a major setback=
 to the DPC, which had already served an asset transfer notice to the MSEB =
on December 5. The MSEB had already communicated to the DPC that it would n=
ot be party to the DPC's decision to appoint a valuer after the issuance of=
 asset transfer notice since it has rescinded the power purchase agreement =
on May 29 following a material misrepresentation and default on the availab=
ility of power by DPC. The IFIs had prayed that the issuance of final termi=
nation notice by DPC to MSEB would jeopardise their interest as well as inv=
estments in the "distressed" Dabhol project.=20

The November 19 meeting was also to take up issues related to the asset pre=
servation, the financial position of DPC relating to the phase-I, debt serv=
icing, safeguarding the legal position of its directors and opening of lett=
er of credit for shipping. The DPC board was quite worried especially over =
the upkeep of the Dabhol plant, which has been closed since May 29 when MSE=
B suspended power purchases. The construction contractors have also suspend=
ed construction works on Dabhol phase-II (1,444 mw) from June 17 in view of=
 DPC's inability to make their payments. The DPC board would also have take=
n up the issue relating to the DPC's decision to pull out of the Dabhol pro=
ject. The company, which had decided to sale its stakes at $1.2 billion, re=
cently expressed its desire to reduce it at around $850 million.=20

BUSINESS STANDARD, Monday, November 19, 2001
Blackout in the power sector, A V Rajwade=20

Every foreign company in the Indian power sector wants to exit. Of these, t=
he most controversial has been Enron and its Dabhol Power Company Ltd (DPCL=
). This apart, the experience of investors in the "reformed" power sector i=
n Orissa is also unhappy. Five years ago, Orissa was the first state to ado=
pt the World Bank-recommended model of separating generation, transmission =
and distribution of power, and an independent regulator. The Godbole Commit=
tee has recently recommended the same for Maharashtra as well. Clearly, sep=
arating the three functions is a complex restructuring. Maybe it helps priv=
atisation, the current fashion on the subject having been set in Thatcherit=
e Britain. While some privatisations in UK have succeeded, the experience h=
as not been consistent all over.=20

Take UK's rail sector. While privatising, the government in its wisdom deci=
ded to separate the ownership of the rail network (Railtrack) and the owner=
ship and operation of trains. The contractual relationship between the vari=
ous operating companies and Railtrack were governed by a byzantine, bewilde=
ringly complex system of penalties and incentives, to be monitored by an in=
dependent regulator. Such separation had no parallel. Besides, Railtrack su=
ffered from poor management, cost escalation in modernisation of tracks, et=
c. Several serious accidents occurred and fixing responsibility became diff=
icult. The "reform" did not work, and Railtrack was put back under public c=
ontrol last month.=20

What are the chances of trifurcation of the power sector in India succeedin=
g? Pretty poor, if the experience of Orissa is any guide. It faithfully sep=
arated the three functions, and privatised distribution and part of generat=
ion. AES, a foreign company, was 49 per cent investor in a generating compa=
ny, and 51 per cent in CESCO, a distribution company. As Gajendra Haldea an=
alysed in this paper on August 27, "The policy and regulatory framework was=
 inadequate and myopic." Distribution losses, a euphemism for power theft, =
were much larger than the companies had been led to believe at the time of =
privatisation. CESCO defaulted in paying the dues of GRIDCO, the transmissi=
on company, which in turn defaulted to the generating company. Indeed, all =
CESCO's cash inflows are now escrowed, leaving it no money even to pay sala=
ries. For all practical purposes, the distribution companies seem to be in =
a difficult situation, perhaps beyond redemption, and the "reform" is a tot=
al mess. The crux of the problem in the power sector is not whether a unifi=
ed SEB is less efficient than trifurcated companies _ it is the political u=
nwillingness to charge a price which covers the cost to all consumers. For =
a while, cross subsidisation worked with commercial consumers subsidising t=
he household and the agricultural segments.=20

However, as the burden became too large, the commercial sector started movi=
ng to captive generation, further worsening SEB finances. An "independent" =
regulator for power tariffs may not solve the problem. He may fix economic =
prices _ but will the state come forward to protect the bill collectors, pu=
nish power thiefs, face social unrest if power to recalcitrant consumers is=
 cut off? So long as the answers to these questions are in the negative, as=
, sadly, they are, the institutional restructuring is no substitute for sub=
stantive action. No wonder all foreign investors in the power sector want t=
o get out!=20

Enron too wants out _ but it has many more problems in its home country, ov=
er and above its dispute with MSEB. It had attracted a lot of adverse publi=
city for gouging power consumers in California, a state in a power crisis (=
see World Money, February 2, 2001). The Internet craze also had a hand in E=
nron's misfortunes. It became an energy trader, established an electronic t=
rading platform, had broadband ambitions, went into a disastrous diversific=
ation in water supplies which, if I remember correctly, led to Rebecca Mark=
's exit. Perhaps it went into too many areas too quickly under Jeffery Skil=
ling, ex-McKinsey, and was notorious for opaque, complex accounts.=20

To top it all, last month it announced that it will take an extraordinary $=
1.2 billion charge in its third quarter results for losses in financial act=
ivities. Enron's chief financial officer, who was supposed to be in charge =
of these, has resigned amidst reports that a private equity fund associated=
 with him was involved in them. The SEC is investigating the affair and Enr=
on's share price is down 67 per cent since mid-October. There are some repo=
rts that Shell may make a bid for Enron. After its ratings were downgraded,=
 Enron is desperate for liquidity and anxious to dispose its assets. DPCL w=
as already on the platter; now a sale has become even more urgent. Reported=
ly, Tatas and BSES are interested; so are the lending institutions. Clearly=
, if a settlement is to be reached, this is the optimum time. But one is no=
t very optimistic. For one, Delhi and Mumbai will be involved, and bureaucr=
acies never understand opportunity costs. Our byzantine decision-making pro=
cesses make timely decisions impossible. Further, if a deal does take place=
, there will be the inevitable allegations of corruption. It is much safer =
for the reputation of the concerned ministers in Mumbai and Delhi to allow =
the drift to continue, to "let the law take its own course", whatever the c=
osts! Sadly, as Jairam Ramesh said in this paper, Indian politicians respon=
d to developments only out of compulsion, not conviction.

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

FIs peg reserve price of Dabhol at $700 million

The Indian financial institutions (FIs) led by the Industrial Bank of India=
 (IDBI) have fixed the reserve price of the $3 billion Dabhol Power Company=
 at $700 million. At a meeting in Singapore last week with the two prospect=
ive bidders _ BSES and Tata Power Company _for the controversial 2,184 MW p=
ower project, IDBI chairman P.P. Vora reportedly took a hard line and told =
them in no uncertain terms that they should be prepared to put in at least =
$700 million for the project. BSES and Tata Power have evinced interest in =
acquiring an 85 per cent stake in DPC (65 per cent of Enron Corporation of =
the US and 10 per cent each of Bechtel Enterprises and General Electric's e=
quity). "Technically, no bid has been called for. But for all practical pur=
poses, the reserve price has been fixed at $700 million as the IDBI chairma=
n made it clear to the BSES and Tata Power brass that DPC would not be sold=
 cheaper than this," an institutional source said.=20

Both the companies seem to have accepted the IDBI stand on the project's pr=
ice as they are planning to start due diligence of the project, after signi=
ng a confidentiality agreement with DPC. The FIs have taken a proactive rol=
e in scouting for a white knight for DPC because they would end up sinking =
hefty sums in the venture. The total exposure (both funded and non-funded) =
of the Indian banks and financial institutions to DPC is about Rs 6,100 cro=
re _ about 70 per cent of the debt component of the project built on a 70:3=
0 debt: equity ratio. IDBI has the maximum exposure (around Rs 2,300 crore)=
, followed by the State Bank of India (Rs 1,800 crore) and ICICI (Rs 1,700 =
crore). Besides, the Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI) and Can=
ara Bank also have exposure to the project. The Singapore meeting focused o=
n completing Phase-II of the project and the sale of the shareholding oh En=
ron, Bechtel and General Electric to either of the prospective new buyers, =
BSES and Tata Power. DPC has mothballed phase I of the project (740 MW) som=
e time back. Phase-II of the project, 90 per cent of which has been complet=
ed, includes a LNG processing facility of about 5 million tonne per annum.=

Editorials - Just stick it out or be a sucker, Abracadabra / Shubhrangshu R=
oy=20

YOU move a step forward and you are a sucker, you move a step backward and =
you are a sucker still. That just about sums up India's predicament in tryi=
ng to get one-time US energy trading giant Enron off its back and off the 2=
,100 MW Dabhol power plant for some time now. For the past fortnight or so,=
 the institutions have been bargaining hard to find a buyer for Enron's ass=
ets in Maharashtra, having committed over Rs 6,200 crore in loans. Last wee=
kend, they even went into a huddle in Singapore to sew up the loose ends of=
 a bail-out. Little seems to have been thrashed out so far. Little possibly=
 will. Unless, of course, the FIs tighten the screws with a take-it or leav=
e-it offer. The time to make that choice is now. A gentleman in pin-stripes=
 who's done a lot of running around these past few weeks to help sew up the=
 deal, told me the other day that Enron had indeed agreed to part with its =
stake in DPC at a 30 per cent discount. That would have fetched it just abo=
ut $800-odd million spread over a five-year period. So, why hasn't a deal b=
een struck?=20

It's probably not worked out because of what Enron considers a fair discoun=
t on what it has sunk into the project. Prospective buyers consider this to=
o high an asking price. For the record, Enron claims to have sunk in $1.2 b=
illion in the project together with its partners GE and Bechtel who have su=
pplied equipment and helped construct the plant. But my gentleman friend in=
 pin-stripes suggests that $1.2 billion isn't exactly their equity contribu=
tion in Dabhol. That amount works out to just about $800 million. Enron, ac=
tually splurged close to $200 million on development expenses, which in gen=
tlemen's lingo is another way of saying that the energy giant could have en=
ded up bribing its way to see the once coveted project through besides figh=
ting sundry court cases in India. And it wants part of that money back. Now=
 which prospective buyer will compensate Enron for possible bribes or for m=
aking court appearances?=20

Enron, it appears, has also claimed another $140 million as its share of Da=
bhol's retained earnings, which should eventually go to all stake-holders i=
n DPC (the MSEB included) once the company's board passes a resolution that=
 the amount is shared proportionately among all those who have invested in =
Dabhol's equity capital. Till then, leave the retained earnings aside. So, =
what Enron should work on is a fair discount on its equity contribution in =
the project, which is no more than $800 million. Now given its willingness =
to take a 30 per cent knock, Enron should not expect more than $560 million=
 as the asking price for walking out of Dabhol. Add to that, if you will, a=
nother $140 million by way of retained earnings and Enron should not be get=
ting more than $700 million at the most. Is Enron willing to take this knoc=
k?=20

Given a choice, it could resist this offer. But Enron has no choice. And th=
at's reason for cheer. Last week, Enron, close to the present American disp=
ensation (chairman Ken Lay was the biggest fund-raiser for President George=
 Bush's campaign effort last year) opted for a $7.8 billion rescue offer fr=
om smaller Houston rival Dynegy after narrowly escaping credit ratings cut =
to junk status. For the past several months Enron had been using its clout =
with Mr Bush to push through a bail-out package on Dabhol that suited its t=
erms. That privilege now seems to be gone as the company grapples to stave =
off a Securities Exchange Commission inquiry into off-balancesheet transact=
ions. And until Enron clears several questions back home about its finances=
, it will remain suspect in the eyes of US investors.=20

In India, where Enron's made more news for its misses than its hits, the ti=
ming couldn't have been more opportune than now for prospective private bid=
ders to strike a potentially lucrative deal. Two such bidders, Tata Power a=
nd BSES, are said to have offered no more than $400 million to buy out Enro=
n's stake in DPC. It's time they stuck to that price. Or else, we could sti=
ll end up being suckers. What?=20

'LNG Laxmi' to bring prosperity to SCI, P.Manoj=20

A DIWALI gift is on the way to State-owned Shipping Corporation of India (S=
CI) when a consortium takes possession of a 137,000 cubic metre capacity LN=
G tanker from Japan's Mitsubushi yard on Thursday (November 15) after weath=
ering a last minute financial storm. Aptly named `LNG Laxmi', after the God=
dess of Wealth and Prosperity, SCI's 20 per cent equity stake in the projec=
t worth $ 1 million will bring in returns in the form of time charter hire =
rates in proportion to its equity holding. Though, the 20 per cent stake wi=
ll ensure a board presence for SCI on the joint venture Greenfield Shipping=
 Company, it falls short of ensuring veto powers for the State-owned shippi=
ng line. This is the maiden foray by an Indian shipping company into the hi=
ghly specialised and capital- intensive LNG shipping trade, marked by stead=
y revenue streams over long periods, ranging from 10 to 25 years. Says Mr P=
 K Srivastava, Chairman and Managing Director, SCI: ``This was a pioneering=
 effort by an Indian shipping company into LNG shipping.=20

So we were very keen that we should not fumble. We are optimistic that the =
experience gained from Greenfield would lead us to more such ventures in fu=
ture.'' Rightly so. While LNG Laxmi was being built, SCI also secured its s=
econd LNG shipping deal, when it teamed up with Mistui, NYK Line and K Line=
 to clinch the contract from Petronet LNG Limited (PLL) for owning and oper=
ating two tankers of 138,000 cubic metre capacity each for transporting gas=
 from Qatar to Dahej in Gujarat. Though SCI had only 20 per cent stake in G=
reenfield, it managed to secure a higher holding of 34.21 per cent in the P=
LL deal worth Rs 130 crore. Originally, LNG Laxmi was ordered for transport=
ing 2.5 million metric tonnes per annum of LNG from Oman to the controversi=
al Dabhol Power Project in Maharashtra.=20

Greenfield was formed for owning and operating the tanker costing $220 mill=
ion. The consortium members comprise Japan's Mitsui O.S.K. Lines holding 60=
 per cent stake, SCI and Enron-affiliate Atlantic Commercial Inc with 20 pe=
r cent stake apiece. Greenfield had entered into a time charter agreement w=
ith DPC for transporting gas from Oman to its power plant in Maharashtra fo=
r a period of 20 years at a time charter hire rate of $98,600 per day. With=
 DPC in trouble, the time charter party signed between DPC and Greenfield w=
ill be scrapped. `LNG Laxmi' went through major birth pangs before the prom=
oters were able to take possession of the vessel. In the process, Greenfiel=
d underwent a major change in the complexion of its promoters leading to a =
re-alignment in the equity holding pattern.When Enron announced its intenti=

DPC arbitration tribunal to meet on November 24, Sanjay Jog=20

The maiden meeting of the arbitration tribunal headed by Lord Mustill, afte=
r the takeover of Enron Corp by the Dynegy Inc, will take place on November=
 24 in London to decide the future course of action on carrying out arbitra=
tion proceedings against the Maharashtra government initiated by the Dabhol=
 Power Company (DPC) for the non-payment of December bill of Rs 102 crore. =
The arbitration tribunal comprises Maharashtra government's arbitrator Quei=
nton Loh and the DPC's arbitrator Andrew John Rogers QC (former chief judge=
 of the commercial division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales). The m=
eeting deserves significance especially when the conciliatory efforts betwe=
en the DPC, the Maharashtra government and the government of India which co=
ncluded on August 18 failed to reach a compromise formula as the trio stuck=
 to their stands. The DPC referred the matter of non-payment of December bi=
ll to the arbitration tribunal led by Lord Mustill.=20

Sources told The Financial Express that the November 24 meeting would decid=
e the future timetable of arbitration proceedings to be held in London as p=

rom proceeding against the Maharashtra State Electricity Board for carrying=
 out arbitration process until the issue of jurisdiction of Maharashtra Ele=
ctricity Regulatory Commission is resolved, in its arbitration notice serve=
d on April 12 had said that the board had disputed the payment of December =
2000 bill. The MSEB, which was served a total bill of Rs 159.86 crore on Ja=

`Enron buyout will not affect Dabhol project'

The buyout of Enron Corp by its rival, Dynegy Inc, would have no bearing on=
 the future of the Dabhol Power project for the moment. It is learnt that t=
alks on selling out Enron's investment in DPC, amounting to over $ 1 billio=
n, would continue as before. A DPC spokesman said, "It is too early to comm=
ent on how this will impact us." On the question of selling Enron's stake i=
n DPC, he said, "While discussions are happening, it will be inappropriate =
to comment." According to the agreement worked out last week with Dynegy, E=
nron Corp would sell its share for $9.5 million. Pointing out that the deal=
 with Dynegy would materialise only in the third quarter of 2002, an offici=
al with a Indian financial institution aid, "It is important to realise tha=
t this is not a deal based on balance sheets but a stock-swap."=20

The deal was announced even as Indian and foreign lenders to the DPC were m=
eeting in Singapore with DPC office-bearers to negotiate with bidders. The =
prominent companies interested in buying out DPC at this stage are Tata Pow=
er and Bombay Suburban Electric Supply (BSES). A senior official with a fin=
ancial institution said that though assets like DPC could be transferred to=
 Dynegy at a later stage, these aspects would emerge only later in the talk=
s to consolidate the takeover. Financial institutions though are concerned =
about the fallout of the deal on the offers received for Enron's stake in D=
PC. Also, the legal status of such a sale, if it does take place, would hav=
e to be scrutinised carefully, says a senior official of a company which ha=
s lent funds to DPC. In Singapore, Indian FIs led by IDBI and including ICI=
CI and State Bank of India met DPC executives over two days from November 8=
 and discussed the pricing of the stake of the three multinational partners=
 in DPC - Enron, Bechtel and General Electric - with the prospective sponso=
rs, Tata Power and BSES. Incentives promised by the Centre to expedite reso=
lution of the decade-old controversy and the possibility of an affordable t=
ariff also came up for discussion.=20

DPC meet suggests lenders taking cut, MAT exemption, Sanjay Jog=20

A reduction in per unit tariff at Rs 2.70, equity holders and lenders to ta=
ke hits and cuts, a cut in interest rate, exemption from payment of minimum=
 alternate tax, providing mega power status for the Dabhol project and, abo=
ve all, separation of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility from the pow=
er project are some of the highlights of the package considered by the Indi=
an Financial Institutions (IFIs) along with Dabhol Power Company (DPC), Tat=
a Power and BSES at the recently concluded three-day meet in Singapore.=20

IFI sources involved in the Singapore meeting told The Financial Express th=
at the participants have made it clear that the implementation of the packa=
ge would not be possible unless the present equity holders and lenders are =
prepare to take hits and cuts and the Government of India, Government of Ma=
harashtra and Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) provide substantia=
l incentives and concessions. The emphasis has been laid on a substantial r=
eduction in tariff and an early completion of Dabhol phase-II - the constru=
ction of which has been suspended since June 17. "The project will continue=
 to languish if there is no possibility of providing power at an affordable=
 tariff by adding value to the equity," sources added.=20

According to sources, both equity holders and lenders would stand to loose =
enormously as both would have to take hits and cuts. "The existing equity p=
romoter would have to be prepared to take a substantial cut in the equity v=
alue without which the tariff would not come down to a reasonable level," s=
ources said. They have stressed the need for a payment security mechanism f=
or the sale of power. "The Government of Maharashtra will have to take a po=
licy decision to allot suitable distribution circles of above 1,500 mw capa=
city load without which the project will remain unviable," sources said. Th=
e IFIs and utilities have demanded that the Centre would have to provide ex=
emption from the payment of minimum alternate tax (MAT). "Such an incentive=
 is needed as tax is passed on to the consumers. The exemption in MAT will =
ultimately help in the reduction of tariff," sources said. The package also=
 envisages substantial reduction in interest rates by lenders, conversion o=
f foreign debt into rupee debt so that the price of power would not get aff=
ected following foreign exchange fluctuations. The IFIs, DPC, Tata Power an=
d BSES have also suggested a suitable moratorium period of 15 years or more=
. They have unanimously called for providing a mega power status to the Dab=
hol project in a bid to get concessions in the customs duty.=20

According to sources, the existing promoters would have to facilitate final=
isation of a new fuel supply agreement which would result in the fall in co=
st of supply. Further, the LNG facilities would have to be restructured to =
help reduce the capital cost substantially. According to the power purchase=
 agreement between DPC and MSEB, the re-gassification facility is for 5 mil=
lion metric tonne per day (MMTPA) of LNG, whereas the power plant has contr=
acted for only 2.1 MMTPA of LNG (of which 1.8 million tonne is take or pay)=
, and even using that requires an unreasonably high plant load factor. Acco=
rding to Madhav Godbole renegotiation committee, after segregating the LNG =
facility, it could be marketed to other buyers of gas, separate from the po=
wer project. Sources said various government departments and lenders would =
have to consider this package as appropriate decisions would have to be tak=
en at different levels. Moreover, cabinet decisions as well as approvals fr=
om the board of directors of IDBI, ICICI and other lenders would also be re=
quired for the implementation of the package.=20

Andersen's underbelly gets exposed, Sunil Jain=20

The Enron disclosures raise questions about top-notch audit firms. After al=
l the curious financial dealings of various Enron Corp officials, comes the=
 admission that the firm had overstated its profits by around a fifth for t=
he past four years. The disclosure comes in a Securities and Exchange Commi=
ssion filing on the eve of the Enron-Dynegy takeover talks. For those India=
ns who've been agitating against Dabhol Power Company plant in Maharashtra,=
 all this is, of course, just another 'example' of the power company's perf=
idy. If Enron could do this in the US, imagine the kind of fiddles it must =
have done in the case of the Dabhol plant.=20

This, may or may not be true, and certainly needs to be proved. But the fir=
m whose reputation has taken an equal, if not bigger beating, is the audit =
firm Arthur Andersen, a reputed global player. What was, a lawsuit filed la=
st week in Oregon asks, Arthur Andersen doing when all this happened? How c=
ould Andersen not find anything fishy with Enron's financial deals? And, th=
ough the law suit doesn't deal with this, how did Andersen allow such a mas=
sive over-stating of profits? While only a probe will reveal how things man=
aged to go so wrong, it's a good idea to go back and read a book called The=
 Big Six by Mark Stevens, incidentally also the author of The Big Eight, wh=
ich is the number of the top global audit firms before they consolidated an=
d reduced their number to six. Stevens' most evocative story is the one abo=
ut ZZZZ Best, the carpet-cleaning business begun by Barry J Minkow. Barry b=
uilt his company into a formidable enterprise with a turnover of $ five mn,=
 and then decided to go public, and while doing so, boasted that his firm w=
as in the lucrative insurance-restoration business - that is, he got restor=
ation contracts from insurance firms. Minkow then hired top accounting firm=
 Ernst & Whinney (that later merged with Arthur Young to become Ernst & You=
ng) to help boost his image.=20

Ernst decided to do an audit of Minkow's insurance business. Minkow hired s=
omeone's office in Sacramento, bribed the security guard to pretend he was =
familiar with ZZZZ's staff and forced Ernst to do an inspection on a Sunday=
, when other offices were closed. Ernst gave a glowing report of the busine=
ss. The same pattern of 'inspections' was then repeated in other cities. Wh=
en the scandal became public, Ernst pleaded they couldn't be blamed for not=
 being able to detect such an elaborate fraud, and they certainly didn't ha=
ve the skills of the police. The police, who, for instance, just spent arou=
nd ten minutes in each city going to the building department to find out if=
 the buildings that ZZZZ was helping 'restore' had ever had a fire or water=
 leakages ZZZZ claimed they'd had.=20

Fair enough, but the House Committee on Oversight asked what about the 'con=
fidentiality letter' that Ernst had signed? A confidentiality letter that s=
aid Ernst would never disclose the location of the buildings ZZZZ was resto=
ring to any third party - that's fine. It also said it would 'not make any =
follow-up telephone calls to any contractors, insurance companies, the buil=
ding owner ... involved in the restoration project.' Congressman Ron Wyden =
asked Ernst how it proposed to do an independent audit with such restrictio=
ns? Ernst said 'It did not restrict me being able to perform that and I did=
 go on site ... if I would have had any questions that came up in the cours=
e of that review, I would have pursued those questions ...' Of course, ques=
tions didn't come up because Ernst wasn't looking too hard.=20

It gets better. An informant told Ernst the 'restoration' job it had inspec=
ted in Sacramento was a fake. Later, the charge was withdrawn, but none of =
this made Ernst want to revisit the Sacramento site. Later, Ernst walked ou=
t on ZZZZ after some bad press about false credit card billings by ZZZZ, an=
d the account was taken over by Price Waterhouse. This despite Ernst tellin=
g Price Waterhouse that it had found evidence of payments by ZZZZ to the in=
dividual who made and then withdrew the complaint about the restoration job=
s being fake! Incidentally, the discovery didn't prompt Ernst into reportin=
g the matter to the authorities either.=20

In other cases, like the widely-reported Savings & Loan scandals in several=
 states, it was the Big Six - such as Touche Ross in the S&L case - who all=
owed firms to get away with major fiddles such as changing descriptions of =
loans, and ignoring warnings by even the internal auditors. In one Congress=
ional hearing, for instance, the Touche partner was talking of a particular=
 deal which had both an equity and a loan component. What was the amount of=
 the equity, the Congressman asked. I don't know, replied the Touche partne=
r? And they were the auditors. The Enron-Andersen episode shows much remain=
s the same. It'll be interesting to see what action the SEC takes against b=
oth Enron and Andersen in this case. The veneer of professionalism of the B=
ig Six audit firms, needless to say, has been badly damaged.=20

Bidders demand distribution rights, Rajesh Unnikrishnan=20

The two bidders for the 85 per cent stake in Enron promoted Dabhol Power Co=

he 1,500 mw power from Dabhol in the Maharashtra state as one of the pre-co=

of the main issues which had been discussed between the Indian FIs, Tatas a=

Sources close to the development said that both Tatas and BSES have asked a=
 1,500 mw power distribution zone preferably Nagpur Distribution Zone or Na=

There is no official communication from the FIs as far as the allocation of=

Parleys on Enron stake sale continue; BSES, Tata Power begin due diligence

WHILE more skeletons are tumbling out from Enron's cupboards in Houston, he=
ctic negotiations are currently on between Indian financial institutions an=
d power firms BSES and Tata Power for the sale of Enron's Dabhol power proj=
ect. Mumbai-based power companies BSES Ltd and Tata Power have kicked off t=
he process of carrying out due diligence - to find out the true value of th=
e project and economics of the takeover - of the troubled $2.9 billion Dabh=
ol Power Company (DPC). Facing a default on its Rs 6,190 crore loan to DPC,=
 Indian financial institutions are pushing the takeover plan seriously with=
 Enron and bidders. They are also looking out for other buyers besides DPC =
and BSES.=20

BSES has already announced its decision to appoint internal and external ta=
sk forces for carrying out due diligence of the project after signing a con=
fidentiality agreement with DPC. Tata Power is also negotiating to work out=
 the modalities for signing a confidentiality agreement for carrying out du=
e diligence. "Indian institutions are insisting for a minimum reserve price=
 of $700 million (around Rs 3,360 crore) for the Enron stake. Now the ball =
is in the courts of BSES and Tata," said an institutional source. However, =
both BSES and the Tatas are not in favour of paying more than $400 million =
for the project due to huge liability including to the Indian Customs.=20

BSES chairman and managing director RV Shahi had already gone on record say=
ing that the company has shown its interest to acquire 85 per cent stake (6=
5 per cent of Enron and 20 per cent of GE and Bechtel) in the Dabhol projec=
t at the recently concluded Singapore meeting convened by the Indian financ=
ial institutions (IFIs). The rest of the equity would be held by MSEB which=
 is the only buyer of power from Dabhol Power. Shahi said until the complet=
ion of due diligence, BSES expects concrete formulations of various types o=
f incentives/concessions which should be available from the Government of I=
ndia, Government of Maharashtra and lenders. "Outcome of due diligence with=
 concrete proposals of incentives/concessions will enable BSES to assess th=
e valuation for the Dabhol project. It is not a workable proposal for the c=
ompany to accept without due diligence," he added. Bidders are keen that al=
l the steps should be required to significantly reduce the generation tarif=
f. "Unless that happens it will be difficult to positively look at the oppo=
rtunity," said an official.=20

But it's still not clear whether Dynegy will support the exit plan. "Though=
 the takeover has been announced, the process will be completed only by the=
 third quarter of next year," Enron circles said. Maharashtra State Electri=
city Board (MSEB) which holds 15 per cent stake in DPC is trying hard to pr=
event any exit before the stake sale. It is learnt that the two bidders are=
 keen for a reduction in per unit tariff at Rs 2.70, a cut in interest rate=
, exemption from payment of minimum alternate tax, providing mega power sta=
tus for the Dabhol project and separation of liquefied natural gas (LNG) fa=
cility from the power project. These issues were considered at the recent S=
ingapore Singapore meet. "The project will continue to languish if there is=
 no possibility of providing power at an affordable tariff by adding value =
to the equity," FI sources add.=20

According to sources, both equity holders and lenders would stand to loose =
enormously as both would have to take hits and cuts. "The existing equity p=
romoter would have to be prepared to take a substantial cut in the equity v=
alue without which the tariff would not come down to a reasonable level," s=
ources said. They have stressed the need for a payment security mechanism f=
or the sale of power. "The Government of Maharashtra will have to take a po=
licy decision to allot suitable distribution circles of above 1,500 mw capa=
city load without which the project will remain unviable," sources said. Th=
e FIs and utilities have demanded that the Centre would have to provide exe=
mption from the payment of minimum alternate tax. "Such an incentive is nee=
ded as tax is passed on to the consumers. The exemption in MAT will ultimat=
ely help in the reduction of tariff," sources said.=20

The package also envisages substantial reduction in the interest rates by l=
enders, conversion of foreign debt into rupee debt so that the price of pow=
er would not get affected following foreign exchange fluctuations. The IFIs=
, DPC, Tata Power and BSES have also suggested a need for a suitable morato=
rium period of 15 years or more. They have unanimously called for providing=
 a mega power status to the Dabhol project in a bid to get concessions in t=

It is deal-making time in Dabhol, D. Sampathkumar

THE Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company continues to navigate choppy waters=
, in its quest for the safe harbour of unhindered domestic operations. If t=
he uncertainty over cancellation by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board=
 (MSEB) of its power purchase agreement with the company is not enough, the=
re comes the news that MSEB, a 15 per cent stakeholder in the company, refu=
ses to participate in the deliberations of the company's Board. Its tactica=
l compulsions in this regard are entirely understandable. It does not want =
to be even remotely seen as party to decisions of the company that could co=
mpromise its claims against the company at a later date. But the continuing=
 standoff between the MSEB and the overseas promoters notwithstanding, a un=
ique combination of circumstances has provided the right conditions for an =
amicable resolution of the messy tangle that the project is enmeshed in, at=
 the moment. Each of the parties with a stake in the project has its own co=
mpulsions in seeking a resolution of the dispute and thereby put an end to =
the uncertainties facing them vis-a-vis their financial exposure to the pro=
ject. For all the bravado, the basic fact remains that none of the parties =
involved in the deal can afford to dig in its heels and refuse to go along.=
 Leading the list is Enron, the project's principal promoter. Its claims to=
 being the injured party in the game of political football that the project=
 has become, has lost some of its strength in the wake of troubles confront=
ing it at home. Its non- energy business is largely in tatters and controve=
rsies over accounting policies and disclosures of performance, are developm=
ents it could have done without in its quest for an image of purity of a fr=
esh driven snow.=20

Adding a new dimension to the issue is the news of takeover of Enron by Dyn=
egy Inc., a much smaller rival in the industry but without any of the exces=
s baggage of questionable investments of the former. This is a positive dev=
elopment. Dynegy would have its hands full managing the merged business wit=
h all its inherent complexities. The position domestic financial institutio=
ns find themselves in, in this imbroglio, is even more untenable than that =
of the overseas promoter. Servicing of debt would be the first casualty in =
any termination of the commercial contract between the Maharashtra Electric=
ity Board and Dabhol Power Company. With their balance sheets in a precario=
us position the implications for provisioning for non-performing assets tha=
t a default occasions are horrendous. As for the Central Government, its po=
sition as merely the counter guarantor of MSEB's payment obligations under =
the power purchase agreement does not offer it much room for comfort. Also,=
 while in theory, the Centre can pay and recover it out of the finances dev=
olving on Maharashtra from the Centre, in practice, this may prove to be po=
litically infeasible. As it is, some of the more prosperous states in the f=
ederal set-up feel they are contributing far more to the cause of balanced =
regional development than they can reasonably be credited with. The extract=
ion, by way of counter-guarantee obligations, is certain to stoke fissiparo=
us regional sentiments besides handing out a stiff price to the party in po=
wer at the Centre when it is election time in that region.=20

What, then, could be the contours of a possible deal among the interested p=
arties? If the deal is to be sold by each party to its constituents, it mus=
t be seen as a fair one and yet recognise the harsh commercial realities th=
at characterise the present situation of each of the parties to the dispute=
. The project with its integrated structure of power generation, port handl=
ing and regasification can no longer be sustained if domestic bidders are t=
o be roped in as new promoters. For then, the financial outlay implicit in =
a project of such a composite nature is beyond the capability of most domes=
tic players in the power utility business. It hence needs to be rebundled i=
nto two components - namely, the generation assets and support infrastructu=
re such as gas terminal and regasification plant.=20

Second, differential treatment in the valuation of assets in the two phases=
 of the projects is a must. Enron, after all, is in possession of a counter=
-guarantee for the investment made in the first phase of the project. Hence=
, the broad principle of international market price for assets taken over w=
ill have to be tempered by the recognition that insofar as the first phase =
is concerned, the valuation is not so much for pieces of generating equipme=
nt as for a stream of guaranteed cash flows from a commercial contract. The=
 political education expenses that Enron has admittedly incurred cannot com=
pletely be ignored as some Indian entities appear to have been the benefici=
aries. Sensitivity to these aspects provides a possible framework for resol=
ving the dispute.

'DPC sale to be decided by Enron, Tatas, BSES'=20

THE INDUSTRIAL Development Bank of India on Monday said the selling price o=
f the erstwhile US energy major Enron's troubled Dabhol Power Company will =
be decided by the two city-based utilities Tata Power and BSES with the mul=
tinational through `mutual negotiations'. "It is expected that further step=
s in this regard will be initiated by DPC, BSES and Tata Power in the next =
few days to begin the due diligence, after signing a confidentiality agreem=
ent with DPC," IDBI chairman and managing director P P Vora said in a state=
ment here. He said Indian financial institutions including IDBI, ICICI, Sta=
te Bank of India and IFCI, who have an exposure of over Rs 6,000 crore in D=
PC, along with the Centre, MSEB and Maharashtra government, could consider =
certain incentives to prospective new sponsors with a view to making the pr=
oject more attractive and bring down the tariff to a reasonable level. "Bri=
ef features of an incentive package prepared by a committee appointed by th=
e Centre were also discussed," Vora said.

DPC officials also clarified various technical and operational issues, whic=
h will need to be resolved for smooth management transfer and successful op=
eration of the plant by the new sponsors, it said. The three day Singapore =
meeting of the FIs with DPC and the private utilities also included officia=
ls from National Thermal Power Corporation and Central Electricity Authorit=
y to to provide technical advice, the Chairman informed. The issues discuss=
ed included completion of the 1,444 mw phase-II of the project and the cost=
 thereof, sale of Enron, Becthtel and GE's shareholding in DPC (aggregating=
 85 per cent of total capital) to either of the prospective new sponsors li=
ke BSES and Tata Power."Based on these discussions and clarifications provi=
ded by IFIs and DPC, both BSES and Tata Power have expressed deep interest =
to purchase the 85 per cent shareholding of DPC subject to certain conditio=
ns, inter-alia, on price of shares and other related technical and operatio=
nal issues," Vora said.

After their return from the three-day Singapore meet, a senior FI official =
had confirmed that "the road map was now clear. Tata Power and BSES will fo=
rmally look into the financial books of DPC, its loans, sponsors and other =
assets and most importantly the legal wrangles and then make a final bid fo=
r the distressed company". Interestingly, the erstwhile energy major had in=
formed the FIs a few days ago that it was ready to take a 30 per cent hit o=
n its equity at around $850 million from the initial offer price of $1.2 bi=
llion. However, both Tata Power and BSES have demanded a 50 per cent reduct=

Tatas, BSES keen to acquire DPC=20

Indian power generation companies Tata Power Company Ltd and BSES Ltd have =

 the state government, had jointly set up the power plant in the western st=

Govt not to encash gurantees against DPC=20

IN AN ad-interim order, Mumbai High Court has restrained the Centre and cus=
toms authorities from encashing guarantees undertaken by State Bank of Indi=
a in regard to customs duty payable by Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Corporat=
ion for importing equipment to build liquified petroleum gas terminal in it=

n November 15 on a petition filed by DPC challenging the show cause notice =
issued by customs authorities asking the company to pay Rs 245 crore as imp=
ort duty on the equipment. The court also restrained the SBI to make paymen=
t under the guarantees undertaken by it on behalf of DPC. The judge, howeve=
r, allowed DPC to file an appeal before customs, excise and gold appellate =
tribunal within a period of four weeks from the date of his order (November=
 15). He also ruled that the ex-parte injunction order shall automatically =
stand vacated from December 15 subject to the orders that may be passed by =
the tribunal.

Meanwhile, the court directed DPC and respondents to keep the bank guarante=
e alive and enforceable. It also ordered that notices be issued to the resp=

rtment, the adjudicating officer had ruled that the power producer had wron=
gly availed of the customs duty concession to import equipment needed for L=
PG project. According to him, the concession was available only for the pow=

FIs for allotting distribution zone to DPC buyer, Anto T Joseph

IDBI-LED financial institutions are putting together a proposal to be prese=
nted to the state government and Maharashtra State Electricity Board, under=
 which the buyer of Enron's Dabhol Power Company would be allotted a distri=
bution zone. The new owner would also be allowed to sell electricity direct=
ly to consumers, if the proposal is accepted. This proposal formed the basi=
s of discussions during the recent three-day Singapore meet between IFIs, D=
PC and the two utilities in the fray for buying Enron out of DPC, Tata Powe=
r and BSES. If the proposal doesn't find favour with MSEB and the governmen=
t, it will be a setback for domestic lenders, who would be forced to piece =
together another workable model.

FI sources said offering a profitable distribution zone and allowing third-=
party sale of electricity was a pre-condition set by both the contenders. P=
rimarily electricity distribution utilities, both Tata Power and BSES will =
also evaluate one of the lucrative distribution zones of Navi Mumbai, Thane=
 or Pune as part of the package deal. ET had on October 6 reported that the=
 domestic lenders had mooted a similar proposal, with the help of the Centr=
al Electricity Authority. Maharashtra State Electricity Board had then reje=
cted the proposal to part with any part of its distribution network to any =
private power utility. Since then, things have moved fast and mostly in fav=
our of the domestic lenders with the Union government and the power ministr=
y supporting the proposal. "This is a payment security mechanism, thrown up=
 by Indian lenders. If MSEB buys the power from phase I (744 mega-watt), th=
ere needs to be a buyer for the rest of 1440 MW produced by the second phas=
e.

This could be a combination of two - handing-over of a MSEB-owned distribut=
ion circle and selling power directly to a few industries," said a BSES off=
icial. Another option of NTPC buying power from the plant was also discusse=
d at the Singapore meet. MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal told ET that no such pr=
oposal has ever come to the board from domestic lenders. "Tata Power has be=
en demanding an extension of their distribution areas. But we can't afford =
to oblige because that would imbalance our receivables," said Bansal. As th=
e FI officials pointed out, the proposal involves all involved parties maki=
ng sacrifices to salvage the project. While the sacrifice would be in the f=
orm of lower interest rates for lenders and selling its stake for an amount=
 below its initial investment by Enron, MSEB would have to sacrifice a dist=
ribution zone.

MSEB, however, says that once a lucrative zone is chopped off from its dist=
ribution area, it will lead to MSEB's cashflows declining drastically. "The=
se economics are preventing us from giving away any distribution areas," sa=
id a MSEB official. Over the last two years, Maharashtra State Electricity =
Board had tried to unbundle its functions and privatise distribution circle=
s by appointing IL&FS and the Administrative Staff College of India of Hyde=
rabad. Both IL&FS's proposal to form a joint venture to privatise Navi Mumb=
ai, and ASCI's Maharashtra Electricity Reform Bill are currently on the bac=
kburner.

BSES moves ministry over Enron's stake in DPC, S Ravindran=20

After a series of flip flops, power major BSES has formally communicated to=
 the Union government that it is interested in buying out Enron's stake in =
the Dabhol Power Company (DPC). It has, however, added the now-familiar rid=
er that the capital cost of the project should be brought down. BSES chairm=
an and managing director R V Shahi said, "We have formally told the ministr=
ies of power, finance and financial institutions Industrial Development Ban=
k of India, ICICI and the State Bank of India that we are interested in the=
 project. The communication was despatched last Saturday." Shahi also said =
that a financial re-engineering of the $3 billion, 2,184-mw power project w=
as necessary so that the cost of power was affordable.=20

Analysts, however, queried the seriousness of BSES's intentions in view of =
the various conflicting statements made earlier by Shahi. He has made publi=
c statements that the company is interested in the project but has denied t=
hem in communications to the Bombay Stock Exchange. Sources familiar with a=
n earlier round of discussions with Enron say that BSES had offered to buy =
the equity at a 90 per cent discount. This would have meant BSES paying onl=
y around $120 million for the 85 per cent stake that Enron and its two US p=
artners -- General Electric and Bechtel -- hold in the company. The three p=
artners have so far invested around $1.2 billion in the project. Tata Power=
 managing director Adi J Engineer insisted that the company was still inter=
ested in the Dabhol project. "We have not held any serious discussions on t=
he issue in the last fortnight but discussions will resume shortly. There i=
s no roadblock and the final outcome will depend upon the sacrifices willin=
g to be made by all the stokeholders in the project," he said. Engineer ref=
used to divulge further details. The lenders to the project have mooted a t=
hree-pronged formula for the sale of power from the Dabhol power project. T=
he entire power from the 740-mw first phase of the project should be bought=
 by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. Half the power from the 1,444-=
mw second phase will be bought by the central government utility, National =
Thermal Power Corporation, while the other half will be sold within Maharah=

Meanwhile, the financial institutions are awaiting the results of political=
 parleys between the Centre and the Maharashtra Government towards bringing=
 the latter into a `solution finding' mode to implement a financial restruc=
turing package and resolve the Dabhol crisis. Once this is done, the FIs wi=

o 'favouritism'. "It (the agreement signed between Coca-Cola and the govern=

Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?"

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Thank you.

Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Som=
e of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personne=
l) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, =
there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all th=
e steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our faciliti=
es and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi=
ty, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business con=
trols organization.  You can contact this organization through their websit=
e (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email =
(CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John B=
rindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Pleas=
e feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, =
or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for t=
he Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be ins=
tituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?=09As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron =
Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?=09Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid =
picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S=
. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identif=
ication).=20

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing=
 in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca=
rd.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. o=
r foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identifica=
tion) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?=09Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b=
adged contractor at all times.

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo=
yee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby receptio=
n area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointm=
ent.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to=
 the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected=
, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the =
escorting employee or badged contractor.

?=09Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their =
workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Secu=
rity (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y=
ou or hold doors open, allowing "tail gating" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit=
uted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times=
 in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi=
pment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand the=
se measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. =09


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommenda=
tions:

?=09While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommend=
s that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to str=
ongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pak=
istan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Geo=
rgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that =
planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Ara=
bia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?=09For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate securit=
y recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent =
reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being question=
ed and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a re=
sult, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the Uni=
ted States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry th=
eir passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest=
 that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card=
 as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immi=
gration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National=
ity Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her "regi=
stration" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanen=
t Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Cros=
sing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not his=
torically been asking domestic travelers for "registration" documentation, =
but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it=
 would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c=
urrent lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corpor=
ate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Wednesday, October 24, 2001=20
Anti-Enron lobby takes a knock as state excludes Aney from lawyers panel, S=
anjay Jog

The anti-Enron lobby has received a major setback following the Maharashtra=
 government's decision not to include senior advocate Shrihari Aney's name =
in the panel of lawyers which would brief the state's solicitors DLA and th=
e Queen's counsel Lord Alexander to challenge the London court's ex-parte o=
rder restraining the government from filing any suit in the Indian court or=
 tribunal against the international arbitration proceedings initiated by th=
e Dabhol Power Company (DPC). The state government's panel would comprise o=
f its solicitors Rafiq Dada, Amit Harayani and Darious Khambata. The team w=
ould leave for London in the first week of November. State government sourc=
es told The Financial Express that Mr Dada, Mr Harayani and Mr Khambata wou=
ld brief the government's solicitor DLA and its Queen's counsel Lord Alexan=
der. The government was in the process of preparing its petition challengin=
g the October 10 order of London High Court of Justice (Queen's Bench Divis=
ion, Commercial Court). Sources said that the axe has fallen on Mr Aney fol=
lowing his outburst against the government on September 18 for exclusion of=
 fraud in the proposed civil suit to be filed against DPC in the Mumbai hig=
h court. Mr Aney's views in this regard has been publicly supported by the =
anti Enron lobby which had alleged that certain forces in the government we=
re "diluting" the Dabhol suit. Mr Aney, who had withdrawn his resignation a=
s the government's counsel after his meeting with the state energy minister=
 Padmasinh Patil, had stressed the need for including fraud, issues related=
 to public interest, public policy and absence of legal sanction in the civ=
il suit "in order to put forward a complete, fruitful and effective case ag=
ainst the DPC." Analysts believe that the government did not want to face f=
urther embarrassment and decided to drop Mr Aney's name from its panel visi=
ting London. The DPC in its defence had quaoted Mr Aney's observations befo=
re the London High Court of Justice (Queen's Bench Division, Commercial Cou=
rt) before seeking an injunction. According to DPC, "there are some indicat=
ions as to state government's intended position in the Indian press reports=
. In particular, it appears that the state government are void and to reply=
 upon grounds of fraud, public policy, public interest and misrepresentatio=
n." Quoting the newspaper report, the DPC said "the state government's lawy=
er was reported as proposing a broad based suit which should pray that the =
high court declare the three contracts with DPC as unforceable and void and=
 that this argument should be based on a number of factors. "DPC made mater=
ial misrepresentation to MSEB about the plant's capabilities.=20

BG offers ONGC equity in Brazil for Mukta-Panna, Soma Banerjee=20

BRITISH Gas (BG) has offered ONGC equity in its exploration acreage in Braz=
il and a settlement in the cash call dispute in lieu for the operatorship o=
f the Tapti Panna and Mukta oilfields which is being claimed by ONGC and Re=
liance following the sale of Enron's equity to BG. The Britain-based gas ma=
jor had set a deadline of October 31 to settle the issue over operatorship.=
=20

In return for the package BG has asked ONGC towaive its right to seek the r=
emoval of EOGIL, acquired by British Gas, asoperator following the change o=
f control. The operatorship of the fields are a crucial issue to all the eq=
uity holders as it is an extra source of revenue. Niger Shaw, the vice-pres=
ident BG India had said that the deal to buy out Enron Oil and Gas India 30=
 per cent stake would fall through if BG was not given the operatorship of =
the oilfields.=20

EOGIL was the operator of these fields and BG had bought the company with t=
he understanding that the operatorship of the field would be transferred to=
 the new equity holder. However, both ONGC and Reliance the other equity ho=
lders in the project have staked claim to the operatorship. The production =
sharing committee has entailed that the issue of operatorship has to be dec=
ided on a consensus by the equity holders of the project.=20

US regulators probing Enron deals, stock slides 20 pc
Shares of Enron Corp slumped more than 20 per cent on Monday after it said =
US regulators are looking into some of its transactions, the latest in a se=

expectedly in August. A spokesman for North America's biggest buyer and sel=

ation by the US Securities Exchange Commission, but said it was cooperating=
. The SEC also declined to provide details. Investor confidence in the comp=

sactions between Enron and two limited partnerships that were run until rec=

he deal raised "conflict-of-interest" questions but Enron has rejected any =
such suggestion, saying the deals were disclosed in SEC filings and approve=
d by its board and internal and external auditors. A former Wall Street fav=
ourite that has fallen from grace during the last 12 months, Enron reported=
 its first quarterly loss in more than four years last week after taking $1=
.01 billion in charges and writedowns on ill-fated investments. Enron has s=
uffered a series of high-profile setbacks, ranging from problems at its bro=
adband telecommunications business, a payments dispute at an Indian power p=

AES approaches Indian govt for payment dues

AFTER Enron, it is the turn of US-based AES to seek the Indian Prime Minist=
er's help to settle its grievances with the Orissa government. In a letter =
to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, AES president Dennis W Bakke said his company's de=
termination to continue in India was being tested by the government of Oris=
sa . The letter, a copy of which was made available to The Associated Press=
 on Tuesday, was dated October 1, and appeared to have been faxed to the of=
fice of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The Virginia-based energy comp=
any operates two power plants in Orissa, holds 49 per cent of the Orissa Po=
wer Generation Corp and manages the main power distribution company in the =
state. AES is the other major American power company besides Enron to have =
made big investments in India after the government allowed foreign investme=
nt in the power sector in the early 1990s. In his letter, Bakke drew Vajpay=
ee's attention to the "expropriation, repeated contract violations, intimid=
ation ... and direct interference with day-to-day management" by the state =
government and its agencies.The letter also complained about government-run=
 agencies failing to pay Rs 210 crore ($44 million) in bills.=20

"If the situation faced by AES is not remedied urgently, it will undermine =
the trust and confidence of foreign investors in India," Bakke wrote. "Whil=
e AES still remains committed to India as a country it would very much like=
 to serve, our determination to continue is being tested." The Prime Office=
 said it was not ready to comment on the report. Officials of the Orissa go=
vernment were not available to respond to Bakke's charges in view of a Hind=
u festival. AES has already offered to withdraw from the distribution compa=
ny -- known as the Central Electricity Supply Company of Orissa. However, i=
t has said that the company will continue with its interests in electricity=
 generation. If AES decides to pull out completely, it will the third Ameri=

 a letter to Vajpayee threatening legal action to pursue claims of up to $5=

DPC sponsors meet next week for due diligence talks=20
Senior officials of energy major Enron Corp, Bechtel and GE, the three fore=
ign sponsors of the troubled Dabhol Power Company (DPC), will meet in Houst=
on next week to take a decision on whether to proceed with the proposal of =
due diligence to be carried out by city-based power utilities, the Tata Pow=
er Company and BSES Ltd. "The offshore sponsors of DPC have not yet given t=
heir go-ahead for potential buyers of their 85 per cent equity to commence =
due diligence. They are scheduled to meet before this month end to decide t=
heir next step regarding Dabhol project," sources close to the sponsors sai=
d here on Tuesday. When contacted, DPC spokesperson declined to confirm or =
deny the development. Sources said that the sponsors' decision would be con=
veyed to the Industrial Development Bank of India-led consortium of Indian =
lenders by first week of December. "Contradictory to recent announcements b=
y Indian lenders, and the prospective buyers, the ability of any party to s=
ign the confidentiality agreement and proceed with due diligence will after=
 all depend on the three foreign sponsors' approval," they pointed out.
Both Tatas and BSES would need their approval and co-operation to commence =
due diligence, sources emphasised. Tata Power managing director Adi Enginee=
r confirmed that they were yet to commence DPC due diligence. "We are waiti=
ng to sign the confidentiality agreement with DPC sponsors after which Tata=
 Power would take at least a few months to complete the process," Engineer =
said. Sources termed the meet as critical in deciding the future course of =
events in resolving the issues surrounding the $3 billion power project. "E=
nron, GE and Bechtel had raised the issue of continuing costs of fundings d=
uring the three-day marathon Singapore meet, risen as a result of the India=
n and foreign lenders' refusal to disburse additional funds," they informed=
.
The proposed due-diligence was expected to take another two-three months, s=
ources said, adding the situation had become more fragile with the Maharash=
tra State Electricity Board not drawing power since May 29 and lenders stop=
ping disbursements to the 2,814 mw project March onwards. "This has resulte=
d in the beleagured DPC also being unable to meet its loan repayment commit=
ments in September and October," they added. During the Singapore meet, the=
 three foreign sponsors had also expressed their grave concern about bearin=
g additional expenses as the due diligence process would take its own time =
and incur significant costs, only adding to deterioration of assets and the=
ir cost burden, the sources said. On Monday, BSES Ltd chairman and managing=
 director R.V. Shahi had announced that the company was likely to complete =
the due diligence of the Dabhol project by January end next year. Shahi sai=
d that BSES had returned the draft of confidentiality agreement with commen=

The Fis have been sounding out the both BSES and Tata Power as the governme=

Enron in talks to sell off data centre, Arun Kumar=20

Beleaguered energy major Enron is said to be in negotiations with at least =
two prospective Indian buyers for selling its $18 million Internet Data Cen=
tre (IDC) located at Mumbai. This is the second Indian investment that Enro=
n is looking to exit from. It is already in the midst of a possible selloff=
 of its stake in the controversial Dabhol Power Co. When contacted, an Enro=
n India spokesperson said "as part of our policy we do not discuss this iss=
ue with the media. As you are aware such issues are part of our global stra=
tegy, but we are not desperate to sell".=20

However sources maintained that the company was talking to at least two bid=
ders, one being a leading Mumbai real estate firm, and that talks were curr=
ently hedged on pricing issues. The reason for the selloff move is part of =
Enron's decision to exit from India, the sources added. The move is also be=
ing fuelled by the recent $9.5 billion acquisition of Enron by Dynegy Inc. =
According to the sources, Enron may sell IDC at below cost. It had invested=
 over $18 million (over Rs 90 crore) to develop the 30,000 sq. ft. data cen=
ter, which caters to a host of new economy firms, including Hungama.com and=
 Gateway System. The sources added Enron had considered roping in a strateg=
ic equity partner for IDC and, since that did not happen, "it has now decid=
ed to exit from this business".=20

Enron India had announced grand plans for setting up a nationwide fiber opt=
ic cable backbone to tap rising demand for bandwidth. After the company aba=
ndoned this plan, speculation was rife that it would divest its data center=
 sooner or later. Analysts said the center is a standalone business globall=
y and Enron was left with no option but to take bandwidth on lease from oth=
ers. This increased the project cost, they observed. The company had origin=

e to have it restructured and extended. "We are working with the lenders to=
 restructure or extend the term on the obligation," he said. Palmer said th=

the rating was reduced, it triggered a clause in one of the "limited partne=

board of directors. "We are continuing to review the transactions in questi=

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Dabhol seeks dismissal of MSEB's special leave petition, Sanjay Jog=20

The Dabhol Power Company (DPC), in its counter affidavit has appealed to th=
e Supreme Court to dismiss the special leave petition filed by the Maharash=
tra State Electricity Board (MSEB) against the Mumbai high court order with=
 regard to invocation of letter of credit (L/C) of Rs 136 crore towards Apr=
il power purchase bill by the DPC through its assignee, the Bank of America=
 (BoA). The Supreme Court, which has stayed the Mumbai high court order on =
September 21, would hold hearing on November 2. However, MSEB in its reply =
has made it clear that it will face irrepairable loss and harm if DPC was a=
llowed to draw a letter of credit. The invocation of letter of credit would=
 also upset the financial equilibrium. "DPC ought not to be permitted to up=
set the status quo and financial equilibrium as it now seeks to do particul=
arly after Supreme Court order of September 21," the board said.=20

The DPC has opposed the MSEB's pray to maintain status quo in view of May 2=
9 order passed by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (Merc) =
and later upheld by the high court and apex court with regard to reactivati=
on of escrow account and proceed on international arbitration. According to=
 the company, MSEB's claim of causing irrepairable harm in the wake of invo=
cation of letter of credit was "unsupported by reference to any factual bas=
is." The company has reiterated that the Merc was not a competent authority=
 to adjudicate the dispute and difference between DPC and MSEB. "Any attemp=
t to preserve status quo by freezing all payments and suspending all operat=
ions will have a contrary effect. MSEB is refusing to pay any payments. It =
has not paid since early May 2001," the company said.=20

However, MSEB has reiterated that the Merc's May 29 order has been issued k=
eeping in view the interest of the power consumers of Maharashtra and its f=
inding has not been disturbed by either Mumbai high court or Supreme Court.=
 The Board has made out special equities. The DPC has reiterated its argume=
nt that the letter of credit was an independent contract and on June 21, 19=
99, it had irrevocably transferred its right under letter of credit to the =
Bank of America, which is a trustee as per the provisions of PPA. The Bank =
of America is likely to intervene in the matter and is expected to make a p=
etition in this regard shortly. The letter of credit has been renewed from =
time to time. It was renewed on August 16, 2001 by the Canara Bank and its =
validity was extended up to May 2002. According to DPC, the invocation of l=
etter of credit was necessary as sufficient funds would be made available i=
n the onshore retention account to meet the debt service payment to be made=
 to the lenders and meet DPC's other liabilities.=20

Judge name for Enron panel will be out in a week=20

Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has described his two-year tenure as a tig=
ht rope walk. Addressing a district Congress meet at Satara on Saturday, Mr=
 Deshmukh said: "Running the government for the past two years has meant wa=
lking the tight rope. I learnt to keep an ice-pack on my head and put sugar=
 in my mouth while carrying out my responsibilities. That is why I am const=
antly smiling while doing my work and there is nothing wrong with it. Since=
 there is no money in the treasury, the development work is moving at a slo=
w pace and this is a fact. To add to it, I have to run an eight-party coali=
tion government where it is difficult to predict who would be satisfied wit=
h a decision and who would not." He said the government would name a judge =
within a week for the judicial inquiry set up to probe the Enron imbroglio.=
 "I am committed that the truth about Enron should come forth for it will b=
e in the interest of the people. Within a week, we will announce the name o=
f the judge to head the inquiry. The Congress is strong enough to weather t=
he consequence of this decision. Even if we have to lose the government bec=
ause of our decision, we will have no regrets," he said. The Nationalist Co=
ngress Party, which is a member of the Democratic Front government, has bee=
n insisting that the appointment of the judge be deferred and the state, al=
ong with the Centre, hold negotiations with Enron to resolve the issue. The=
 party had asked Mr Deshmukh to defer the inquiry by two months.=20

Maharashtra govt seeks Lord Alexander at ?500 per hour, Sanjay Jog=20

The Maharashtra government's woes vis-a-vis the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) =
continue to mount. Additional financial burden is on the cards for the stat=
e government to the extent of Rs 8 crore as payment towards the Queen's cou=
nsel and solicitors. This is to vacate the ex-parte order granted by the Lo=
ndon High Court of Justice restraining it from filing any suit in Indian co=
urts against the international arbitration proceedings initiated by DPC. Se=
nior state government sources told The Financial Express that the hunt is o=
n for the appointment of a counsel based in London. And on the shortlist: l=
eading Queen's Counsel Lord Alexander who is to be appointed soon. Sources =
said that Lord Alexander would plead the Maharashtra government's case befo=
re the London High Court of Justice (Queen's Bench division, Commercial Cou=
rt).=20

But the good Lord Alexander's services come at a price. The state coffers a=
re none-too-healthy. Efforts, therefore, are on so that Lord Alexander's se=
rvices can be contracted at 500 sterling pounds per hour instead of the quo=
ted 750 sterling pounds per hour. The state authorities, on their part, hav=
e appointed Messers DLA as its solicitors to provide back-up support to Lor=
d Alaxander, and a resolution has already been issued to this extent. The g=
overnment's solicitors in India, Rafiq Dada, Amit Harayani and Darious Kham=
bata would brief DLA and Lord Alexander. According to sources, Messers DLA =
has also been appointed as solicitors for the government during the interna=
tional arbitration proceedings initiated by DPC. The DPC has served arbitra=
tion notices for the violation of State Support Agreement, Supplemental Sta=
te Support Agreement and Government of Maharashtra Guarantee. The hourly ra=
tes at which fees would be paid to DLA are as follows: senior partner 325 p=
ounds, junior partner 300 pounds, senior advocate 235 pounds, assistant 180=
 pounds and paralegal/trainees at 100 pounds. These rates would be discount=
ed at between five per cent to 10 per cent for lawyers in their offices out=
side London. The London court in its ex-parte order of October 10 has restr=
ained the state government from filing any suit in the Indian court to chal=
lenge the international arbitration proceedings initiated by the DPC.=20

Simultaneously, the government has been prohibited from filing any suit wit=
h regard to fraud against DPC. The DPC had earlier pointed out that the inj=
unction ordered by the London court "facilitates the timely and impartial r=
eview by the international arbitration panel of the dispute between DPC and=
 Government of Maharashtra dealing with its failure to comply with its obli=
gations under the state guarantee and the state support and supplemental st=
ate support agreements". However, the anti-Enron lobby has alleged that the=
 London's order has created a disadvantageous situation for the State where=
 it would be unable to defend itself in the writ-petitions with respect to =
its disputes with the DPC and to which, it has been made a party pending be=
fore various courts and tribunals.=20

DPC for written undertaking from Maharashtra govt=20

US energy major Enron's Dabhol Power Company has demanded a written underta=
king from Maharashtra government stating that it will not file a civil suit=
 against the multinational as it was not a party to the power purchase agre=
ement.. "Any attempt by the Government of Maharashtra to file a civil suit =
agaisnt DPC in which the Power Purchase Agreement is impeached, is precisel=
y that which it undertook not to do as per the terms of the final consent a=
ward of December 1996", DPC's legal firm Linklaters and Alliance have said =
in a letter dated October 16 to Maharashtra government's lawyers M/s Hariya=
ni & Co.Referring to a media report, Linklaters has warned Maharashtra gove=
rnment that it was "not and has not ever been a party to the power purchase=
 agreement signed between DPC and Maharashtra State Electricty Board"."Acco=
rdingly, any civil suit such as that being referred (in the media report) m=
ust relate to the agreement to which the GoM is party, namely the guarantee=
s", the letter said. The firm said, it wanted a "written undertaking" from =
GoM that it will not file a civil suit against DPC in respect of any disput=
es arising out or in connection with any three GoM agreements, but that any=
 such dispute would be referred to arbitration in accordance with arbitrati=
on agreements. The media report has quoted the state as saying that Queen's=
 Court in London did not enjoy jurisdiction to issue an injunction restrain=
ing it from filing a suit against in India against on-going international p=
roceedings, Linklaters said.=20

The US energy major's legal firm said, "DPC simply could not understand how=
 the state government is not enjoined from filing a civil suit against DPC =
of the sort described in the article". The multinational has also filed a s=
uit in the London Queen's Court alleging that GoM had breached the consent =
agreement which it had entered with itself in 1996. On October 10, DPC deal=
t a legal blow to Maharashtra by obtaining an injunction from Commerical Co=
urt of London, restraining the state from filing a suit in India challengin=

THE INDIAN EXPRESS, Monday, October 22, 2001
Why Enron needs to simply 'Lay Off', Ramesh Chauhan=20

Surfing the net, the other day, I came across an interesting debate. It ema=
nated from a comment made by the California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, =
who is investigating the energy crisis in that state and has offered hundre=
ds of millions of dollars in reward for information about law breaking in t=
he energy business. It is a comment that has had the gay rights groups, the=
 prisoners' rights groups and assorted other civil liberties groups up in a=
rms. But it has even more interesting import for India. So what is the comm=
ent anyway? Well talking about Enron and the way the energy major conducts =
its business Lockyer said, 'I would love to personally escort (Enron Corp c=
hairman Kenneth) Lay to an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed =
dude who says, Hi honey! My name is Spike'.=20

Remember, this is the AG of the State of California. Not some money grabbin=
g, 'property expropriating' communist ideologue from a third world country.=
 Does he know something that we in India don't? Enron Corp has its back to =
the wall and has made it abundantly clear that it is desperate to get out o=
f India. Good riddance all of us would say, except for the caveats attached=
 for this exit. It has been claimed the project has been financed using a c=
ombination of debt (about $2.2 billion odd) and the rest by equity. The equ=
ity number varies from time to time, but their claim is about billion plus,=
 perhaps as much as 1.2 billion. Enron wants the equivalent of 1.2 billion =
odd dollars (about Rs 6,000 crore) to make an exit. On the face of it this =
would seem to be a perfectly reasonable argument. After all as a businessme=
n, if I want to exit a project mid-way, the least I expect the buyer to pay=
 is what I have invested in the project. But herein lies the problem.=20

If these numbers were correct, then the project cost of Dabhol is now adds =
up about $3.4 billion that is, the equivalent of $1.7 million per MW. This =
would have the dubious honour of the MOST expensive gas fired power station=
 in the history of the world and winning the honours without even a close c=
ompetitor. Let us keep the Enron issue aside for a minute and look at three=
 power plants that were set up over the last eight years in our part of the=
 world. Seoinchon, Korea has a 2,000 MW combined cycle gas turbine plant. I=
n every technical sense, it is a clone of the Dabhol Plant. The same GE STA=
G 207FA turbines are being used, as those in the Dabhol plant. Guess what i=
s the cost of the plant? $900 million or $0.45 million/MW! Less than a thir=
d of the Dabhol cost.=20

Again in Korea, construction of the 2,000 MW combined cycle gas turbine pla=
nt at Poryong began in 1996 and the plant was commissioned in 1999. And the=
 price. $850 million or $0.425 million/MW! Interestingly, the efficiency of=
 the Pryong power plant is 60 per cent, while that of Dabhol is effectively=
 48 per cent. As recently as this month, Malaysian state-owned utility Tena=
ga Nasional Bhd signed a PPA to buy power from Malakoff Bhd for its 640-MW =
project. The project's cost are estimated at about $370 million or about $0=
.58/MW. This is slightly higher than the other two examples, but bigger pla=
nt would always be cheaper due to efficiencies of size. Prayas, a tiny, thr=
ee-member NGO from Pune, has studied project costs of about 40,000 MW of po=
wer projects between 1991 and 1998. The average project cost was in the reg=
ion of $0.6 million/MW and this included small 30 MW plants as well.=20

As a businessman, the cost of electricity matter to me to run my business e=
fficiently. The main reason for my interest in the subject is the ridiculou=
sly high cost of power and the decline of competitiveness on this among oth=
er reasons. As a matter of interest, the energy from the Malaysian PPA is s=
lated to be delivered at energy prices of about 3.2 cents/kWh under a 21-ye=
ar PPA that is about Rs 1.54/unit. This represents the cheapest power on th=
is side of the world and less than a one-third of both Enron as well as the=
 price my plants pay today. So let us look at the calculations for investme=
nt in Dabhol again. $900 million is cost of an identical plant (the first K=
orean one of the same size and using identical turbines that is nearly a cl=
one). 'Wait a minute,' you may ask me here, 'but did Enron not spend more m=
oney.' Yes we would probably need to factor some 'additional' costs.=20

Let us add the cost of the LNG jetty, the regassification terminal and othe=
r add ons. (By the way these had very little to do with the Dabhol Power Pl=
ant. The LNG jetty was to the cornerstone of Enron's energy distribution bu=
siness in India. But like any good supplier Enron billed all of it's costs =
to its client-Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB)- which like any go=
od public sector unit agreed to pay for things it did not need in the first=
 place). Even with these add ons, the capital costs (proportionately) to MS=
EB ought not exceed $1.2 billion. Now doing business in India is particular=
ly difficult. As Enron itself said, it had to spend a lot of money to 'educ=
ate' Indian decision makers. ('Educating' IDBI and ICICI on how to lend. So=
 let us assume that the cost of doing business in India is an additional on=
e or two per cent of project costs -two per cent in this case, adds another=
 24 million-Enron had of course claimed about 20 million in these 'addition=
al' costs (in other words 'over and above project costs'-the now infamous '=
education monies' of 20 million). The figure does not budge. 1,224 million.=
 This represents a difference of 250 odd per cent!=20

Let me be more generous and add, on say another 30 per cent to this-say $40=
0 million. ($400 million is a very large number by the way, in today rupee =
terms nearly Rs 2,000 crore) for completely arbitrary costs. But this still=
 brings us to $1,600 million odd. One would think the number above, $1,600 =
million, would be the cost of the project. However, we are not even close. =
Enron has claimed project costs to be nearly $3,400 million. I can think of=
 perhaps a difference of a few per cent, but over a 100 per cent? The expla=
nation perhaps lies in a little story that was related to a friend of mine.=
 A few years ago, he was a consultant to an industrialist setting up a stee=
l plant. He was looking at the numbers and felt that they did not add up. T=
he industrialist put his head back, laughed and said, 'No one puts up proje=
cts in India so that you can make money after the project is commissioned a=
nd product starts selling. You put up a project so that you can make money =
while the project is being implemented'.=20

I suspect that is exactly what has happened in the Enron project. The missi=
ng $1.7 billion odd has been probably siphoned off by over invoicing and ot=
her time honoured tricks. In other words, Enron has already recovered all i=
ts money that it had invested and also made a very generous return on the m=
oney it actually invested. At this stage, instead of demanding money at all=
, Enron should be worrying about returning the siphoned money in equity, pe=
rhaps about $400 million, and additionally, the $400 million it owes MSEB a=
 result of the breach of its contractual obligations. To summarise, an equi=
table settlement at this stage would be that Enron pays us $800 million (ab=
out Rs 3,800 crore) and in return, we agree to forget the whole issue! Thre=
e days after the tragic events of September 11, when not only America but t=
he entire world was in a state of deep shock, Lay ought to be told to stop =
screaming 'expropriation' and threatening sanctions on us. Instead he ought=
 to be grateful for small mercies, count the money he has already made and =
simply lay off. Otherwise he may have to worry about some Indian prosecutio=
n.=20

THE TIMES OF INDIA, Saturday, October 20, 2001
MSEB asked to rescind tariff hike plan, Vidyadha Date

The Maharashtra government has been announcing subsidy on electricity sold =
to farmers, powerloom owners and other categories but not actually passing =
on the benefit to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the distr=
ibution agency. This has added to the financial problems of MSEB. The dues =
to be given to MSEB run into hundreds of crores of rupees. It includes a su=
bsidy of Rs 700 crore for farmers, Rs 300 crores for powerloom operators, R=
s 600 crore to municipal bodies for use of power for water supply and Rs 21=
5 crore for the Mula Pravara cooperative electric distribution society.The =
chairperson of MSEB Vinay Bansal has appealed to the Maharashtra Electricit=
y Regulatory Commission to ask the government to pay the arrears to MSEB. M=
r Bansal was responding to opposition voiced by a number of representatives=
 of domestic, commercial and powerloom consumers before the Maharashtra Ele=
ctricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) against the proposed power tariff? hi=
ke by MSEB. If it recovered the arrears and reduced its losses, MSEB could =
manage very well without any tariff increase, they said.Mr Bansal said the =
board suffered from various constraints. It could not cut off the power sup=
ply of municipal bodies because this would be in conflict with public inter=
est. He said the board had improved its performance in various ways. There =
had been no load shedding in the past one week, he said. There had been no =
increase in arrears in the past one year as against the previous two years.=
 MERC chairperson P. Subrahmanyam observed that the board was `more sinned =
against than sinning.' Its job was not easy and it could not improve its pe=
rformance overnight, he said.

Experts during their submissions strongly opposed MSEB's move to increase t=
ariff every year. S.R. Paranjpe, a former director of the Indira Gandhi Cen=
tre for Atomic Research, Kalapakkam, said his techno-economic evaluation of=
 MSEB's working revealed several shortcomings and lapses. He said the board=
 deliberately created the impression of a power shortage in the state last =
year in a bid to justify its purchase of power from Dabhol Power of Enron a=
t exorbitant rates. The board resorted to deliberate load shedding as part =
of this exercise and in the process it lost revenue. Besides, sections whic=
h were getting? subsidised power were deprived of the supply. The power sta=
tions also? performed at an `under frequency' level posing several problems=
. The board should have resorted to demand and supply management. It should=
 have asked farmers to consume power at night when the supply was easily av=
ailable.When Dabhol company's power supply was reduced, MSEB's generation s=
uddenly went up. This shows that earlier the board had deliberately operate=
d below capacity. MSEB was disconnecting power supply to many consumers to =
show that it was taking action against defaulters. Yet, the consumption of =
power by consumers in these categories had gone up. It means, some consumer=
s drew power from their neighbours unauthorisedly or resorted to some other=
 means.

The small fry among them were being penalised while the big fish were being=
 allowed to scot free, Mr Paranjpe said. Pradyumna Kaul, a management consu=
ltant and environmentalist, said MSEB had failed to improve its performance=
 on the lines suggested by MERC last year. S.C. Karandikar, appearing on be=
half of the Bhiwandi citizens' welfare society, complained that powerloom o=
wners in Bhiwandi were unjustifiably being given a bad name. He faulted the=
 MSEB on several counts and showed photographs depicting the sorry state of=
 transformers in the town. He also complained that Bhiwandi experienced dai=
ly power cuts for three hours in morning and three hours in evening.He said=
 transmission and distribution losses of the board had gone up, though the =
commission had stipulated last year that they be brought down. Some consume=
rs also alleged that the MSEB was claiming subsidy from the government even=
 for power not supplied to subsidised consumers. Pratap Hogade, vice-presid=
ent of state Janata Dal (secular), called for? rejection of the entire tari=
ff proposal. It was wrong to penalise consumers for the inadequacies of the=
 board, he said. The board's deficit and its expenditure had gone up instea=
d of going down. The commission should not allow frequent tariff revisions.=
 More reprehensible, he said, was that the board had sought to effect the m=
aximum increase for ordinary consumers, including domestic users, small tra=
ders, farmers and gram panchayats. Those using two or three bulbs face an i=
ncrease of almost 250 per cent, Mr Hogade said.

BSES to complete DPC due diligence by January

BSES Ltd will begin due diligence of the 2,184 mw Dabhol power project in a=
 fortnight. The process, aimed at assessing the right price for buying 85 p=
er cent stake in the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company's (DPC), will be c=
ompleted by January. Speaking to reporters on Monday, BSES chairman and man=
aging director RV Shahi said, "The due diligence process will take six to e=
ight weeks after signing of the confidentiality agreement." According to Mr=
 Shahi, his company would be signing the confidentiality agreement, a pre-r=
equisite for beginning due diligence, in another ten days. BSES has sent it=
s comments on various clauses of the agreement to DPC. The company would ap=
point three separate consultants for doing technical, financial and legal d=
ue diligence of the $2.9-billion project, he said on the sidelines of a sem=
inar on natural gas.=20

It would also be constituting an internal task force for doing parallel gro=
und work. The whole exercise would involve assessing the value of DPC's ass=
ets and liabilities besides finding out further investment needed to comple=
te the 1,444 mw Phase-II. Stating that the Dabhol power project as its stan=
ds was not viable, Mr Shahi said that BSES will be going in for financial r=
e-engineering and renegotiation of the gas supply agreement for Phase-II be=
fore taking over the project. DPC had signed a 20 year contract with Oman L=
NG for 1.6 million tonnes per year and Abu Dhabi Gas Liquification Company =
for 480,000 tonnes. He said the total cost of power generation has to be br=
ought down to Rs 2.60-2.70 per unit for making it viable. For this fuel cos=
t and capital cost has to be brought down, he added. BSES has shown interes=
t in acquiring 85 per cent stake of Enron, Bechtel and GE in the Dabhol pro=
ject at the recently concluded Singapore meeting convened by the Indian fin=
ancial institutions. It will fix a price for taking over the stake once due=
 dilligence is completed. After signing the confidentiality agreement BSES =
will formally look into the financial books of DPC, its loans, sponsors and=
 other assets and legal wrangles. Before taking any decision on the acquisi=
tion price of the distressed company.=20

Maharshtra stand on Enron is vindicated, Seema Mustafa=20

The Maharashtra government's refusal to accept Enron's claim of bringing in=
 capital cost of $2.8 billion into the controversial Dabhol Power Corporati=
on has been vindicated by reports of large-scale fraudulent practices by th=
e company in the United States. At present under inquiry by the US Stock Ex=
change Commission, Enron has been virtually wiped out with Dynegy, a Chevro=
n and Texaco company, having reportedly bought Enron for a paltry $9.12 bil=
lion stock swap. Enron's share value plummeted from $90 last year to $7 thi=
s month following disclosures that its senior officials had been transferri=
ng funds to their own pri vate companies without reflecting this in the bal=
ance sheets for the last five years. Enron's chief financial officer was fo=
und involved in the scam and was sacked, although this move could not save =
the company, which has been unable to explain the big gap in its balance sh=
eets. It is reported to have gone down taking $72 billion in shareholders' =
wealth with it. In fact, the President and CEO of Halliburton, Mr Dave Lesa=
r, is on record as saying that Enron's "credibility is finished because the=
y did not provide financial information and, therefore, investor confidence=
 declined." Halliburton claims to be the world's largest provider of produc=
ts and services to petrol and energy industries, functioning in 120 countri=
es with US vice-president Dick Cheney being the earlier CEO of the company.=
=20

The UK, following the expose, has brought Enron's Wessex Water operations i=
n the country under scrutiny with the entire range of utility and energy as=
sets being given a close look. Pressure is being exerted on the Maharashtra=
 government now to ensure that the records are opened and the entire deal i=
nvestigated. Mr Probir Purkayastha of the Delhi Science Forum, which had le=
d a major campaign against the Enron power project here, said the US compan=
y has survived entirely "on energy trading and influence brokering." It had=
 extremely close contacts with the Republican party, including former Presi=
dent George Bush.=20

There was tremendous pressure on India to withdraw its objections and clear=
 the project, particularly after the Bush administration assumed power. The=
 new US ambassador to India, Mr Robert Blackwill, is on record saying that =
India-US relations could be summed up in just five alphabets: "Enron." In f=
act, shortly after assuming office in New Delhi, the ambassador addressed s=
everal business and corporate meetings and pushed for the quick clearance o=
f the stalled Enron project. The Maharashtra government, which had cancelle=
d the seven-year-old power purchase agreement with Enron, was in the middle=
 of court proceedings with the company. It is now expected to resume discus=
sions with Dynegy, although it is in a position to ensure that all records =
are made available and the project thoroughly investigated. Enron's capital=
 cost claim, despite the fact that it was not supported by statistics, was =
accepted by the state government under the then chief minister, Mr Sharad P=
awar.=20

Enron went ahead with the construction of Phase I. In 1995, the Shiv Sena-B=
JP government cancelled the project. Within six months the same government =
revived it. The government claimed that this was because Enron had agreed t=
o reduce the capital cost to $2.5 billion. But, as was pointed out by the O=
pposition parties here and has been accepted by the state government now, t=
he Dabhol Power Corporation had borrowed at least $2.05 billion from Indian=
 and foreign institutions, with the result that the total equity component =
was actually only $450 million. Of this the Maharashtra State Electricity B=
oard had put in $130 million as its own equity, thus, leaving only $320 mil=
lion equity put in by Enron.=20

MSEB seeks refund of Rs 1,200 cr from DPC, Sanjay Jog=20

The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) on Monday appealed to the Bo=
mbay High Court that Dabhol Power Company (DPC) be ordered to pay it an amo=
unt of Rs 1,200 crore towards the excess payment of capacity charges during=
 May 1999 and April 2001. According to MSEB, of the total payment of Rs 3,4=
99 crore towards the power purchases, the capacity charge amounted to Rs 2,=
087 crore. The average purchasing rate per unit of Dabhol Phase-I (740 mw) =
power in 2000-01 has been about Rs 7.30 while its payment for the Phase-II =
(if and when commissioned) would have been in the range of Rs 500 crore per=
 month.=20

MSEB has denied that it has failed or neglected to make payments to DPC und=
er the power purchase agreement (PPA) from time to time and whenever the pa=
yments were made after the due dates, interest was paid to DPC. "It is DPC =
that has defaulted in paying the rebate due to MSEB for the default and mat=
erial misrepresentation on the availability of power without any basis what=
soever. The DPC's refusal to pay/adjust the rebate in terms of the express =
provision of the PPA of undisputed facts is obdurate and wrongful," it said=
.=20

MSEB in its counter affidavit has prayed that DPC's writ petition challengi=
ng the jurisdiction of Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC)=
 to adjudicate upon dispute and difference between MSEB and DPC be dismisse=
d at cost. The Bombay High Court division bench comprising justices Ajit Sh=
ah and Sharad Bobde would begin hearing on the DPC's writ petition from Dec=
ember 11 following the Supreme Court's order of August 6 to settle the MERC=
 jurisdiction issue. The filing of counter affidavit by MSEB today coincide=
s with the completion of six months period after the issuance of two prelim=
inary termination notices by DPC on May 19. DPC, which has already issued a=
nother two preliminary termination notices to MSEB on September 10 however,=
 has been restrained from serving a final termination notice to MSEB by the=
 Bombay High Court on November 9 over a civil suit filed by Indian financia=
l institutions.=20

MSEB further said that the DPC cannot be permitted to go ahead with the arb=
itration when the statute requires that its dispute with DPC be adjudicated=
 upon only by the Merc. "DPC is an Indian company doing business in India a=
nd subject to Indian laws and an utility within the meaning of the Electric=
ity Regulatory Commission Act (ERCA)," MSEB added. MSEB has strongly denied=
 DPC's apprehension that it would not get a proper or fair hearing before t=
he MERC. It further said that "MERC has both the competence3, expertise and=
 regulatory responsibility to adjudicate upon the disputes raised in the MS=
EB's petition filed on May 25 before the MERC," it said.=20

According to MSEB, the disputes it has raised before the MERC involve techn=
ical, commercial and legal issues and it would clearly have consequences/ra=
mifications, which directly bear on matters which have exclusively been ent=
rusted to the MERC under section 22 (1) and 29 of The ERCA. "The MERC, whic=
h is fully competent in every respect to adjudicate upon, is an expert body=
 with special knowledge and experience in matters relating to electricity i=
n Maharashtra state," MSEB said. MSEB said that adjudicating functions/powe=
rs/jurisdiction have been conferred on the MERC in respect of disputes and =
differences between utilities.=20

DPC deadline expires for issuing final termination notice
The six-month deadline set by Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) for=
 Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) to issue the final termination =
notice (FTN) expired today. The power major, however, has been restrained b=
y the Bombay High Court from initiating the process till December 3. Had th=
e DPC issued FTN today, it would have irrevocably bound all parties to endi=
ng the contract without going in for any alternative, an option which is st=
ill open. DPC, on April 19, slapped a preliminary termination notice (PTN) =
on MSEB, due to what it called continuing default in payment of dues by the=
 board on several occasions and political interference to the detriment of =
its business operations. As per the power purchase agreement (PPA) signed b=
etween DPC and MSEB, the PTN gave six months to both parties to resolve the=
 dispute, or else, allows the aggrieved party to terminate the contract and=
 claim damages.While the possibility of DPC issuing the final termination n=
otice was real, a dramatic intervention by the Indian financial institution=
s (FIs) led by IDBI, which moved the high court on November 5, have given a=
 temporary reprieve to the MSEB. The FIs and banks pleaded for an injunctio=
n against DPC and sought reopening of the Dabhol plant The intervention by =
FIs so incensed DPC that it called off the two-day meeting with the represe=
ntatives of the FIs in Singapore in protest .

However, it was persuaded to participate in the meeting, which was aimed at=
 finding a buyer of Enron's stake in the company. Two private power majors,=
 Tata Power and BSES, have shown interest in picking up Enron's stake, but =
at a discounted price The high court, which heard the preliminary arguments=
 of the FIs and DPC on November 9, restrained DPC from issuing the FTN anda=
djourned the hearing till December 3. DPC sources told Deccan Herald the hi=
gh court order means the PTN notice period will continue till December 3 an=
d the company would initiate termination process on that day, if the high c=
ourt allowed it to do so. DPC has claimed that the damages it would claim o=
n final termination of the contract would run around Rs 24,000 crore. This =
figure too has been disputed by the MSEB and the state government. MSEB, on=
 its part, stopped drawing power from Dabhol plant from May 29 onwards, whi=

Greenfield-DPC time-charter pact set to be scrapped, P. Manoj=20

THE time-charter party agreement signed between Greenfield Shipping Company=
 and Dabhol Power Company (DPC) is set to be scrapped as an outcome of the =
controversy surrounding the Enron-promoted troubled power plant in Maharash=
tra. With Dabhol's LNG facility yet to go on stream, DPC will not be able t=
o deploy the 1,37,000 cubic metre capacity tanker `LNG Laxmi' once the prom=
oters of Greenfield deliver it to the charterer as per the charter party ag=
reement signed between the two. The charter party agreement states that the=
 charterer will have to take delivery of the tanker within 45 days of being=
 delivered by the shipowners and operators. ``A failure by the charterer to=
 take delivery of the tanker within the stipulated 45 days would automatica=
lly rescind the charter party agreement", sources familiar with the develop=
ments told Business Line.=20

Greenfield and DPC had entered into a time-charter agreement wherein DPC wi=
ll time-charter `LNG Laxmi' for a period of 20 years at a charter hire rate=
 of $ 98,600 per day for transporting gas from Oman to its LNG facility in =
Dabhol, Maharashtra. Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) is a 20 per cent s=
takeholder in Greenfield. The promoters of Greenfield took possession of th=
e LNG carrier on November 15 after paying the last instalment of $ 55 milli=
on from Mitsubishi shipyard at Nagasaki in Japan, overcoming certain last-m=
inute hiccups. Since DPC is not in a position to take physical delivery of =
the tanker, the promoters of Greenfield are going through the formalities t=
o full-fill contractual obligations. After the 45 days time limit is exhaus=
ted and the time charter contract between Greenfield and DPC automatically =
annulled, the promoters of Greenfield will be able to time-charter `LNG Lax=
mi' to a new charterer.=20

In the meanwhile, Greenfield was able to locate a new charterer in the form=
 of Oman Government, which will time-charter `LNG Laxmi' for 20 years at a =
charter hire rate of a little over $ 70,000 per day as well as pick-up a 50=
 per cent stake in Greenfield. Enron-affiliate Atlantic Commercial Inc., on=
e of the original promoters of Greenfield with a 20 per cent stake worth $ =
11 million, has sold its entire stake to Oman Government. Besides, the lead=
-partner in the consortium, Japan's Mitsui O.S.K. Lines have parted with ha=
lf of its 60 per cent holding in Greenfield amounting to 30 per cent in fav=
our of Oman Government. Oman Government will contribute $ 27.5 million for =
acquiring 50 per cent stake in Greenfield. It will sub-charter `LNG Laxmi' =
to Oman LNG in which it holds a 51 per cent stake. Oman LNG is expected to =
deploy `LNG Laxmi' to transport some of its LNG cargo sold on c.i.f basis t=
o destinations including Britain and Korea, the sources said. A new time-ch=
arter party agreement between Greenfield and Oman Government will be inked =
after the DPC contract is revoked. Oman Government is currently thrashing o=
ut the finer details of the charter agreement with Oman LNG in which Shell,=
Total and Mitsubishi has equity stakes. `` This will ensure that LNG Laxmi =
is gainfully employed without being allowed to remain idle``, the sources s=

Enron had no choice but agree to what seems to be a shotgun marriage

Enron had no choice but agree to what seems to be a shotgun marriage with a=
 rival, Dynegy, a fourth its size Lay: time to play dead? Enron, the most a=
dmired company in the US six years in a row, has been consigned to the dust=
bin of history and business school case studies. Once the darling of Wall S=
treet for its aggressive no-holds-barred growth, its stock was languishing =
at historical lows of $7.21 last week, a steep fall of 90 per cent from its=
 peak last October, representing a notional loss of $80 billion. In the las=
t six weeks alone, its stock plunged by over 400 per cent.Kenneth Lay, the =
politically-connected chairman who counts on the United States' First as we=
ll as Second Families (Vice-President Dick Cheney) as close friends, and th=
e acknowledged power behind 'deregulation', has faced a nightmare over the =
last three weeks.

Following a series of stories first published in The Wall Street Journal an=
d The New York Times, Enron's stock went into a tailspin and it never recov=
ered. The strawalbeit a heavy onethat broke the camel's back was a $1.01 bi=
llion charge on its pro-forma statement of earnings. Subsequently, it has e=
merged that most of Enron's purported earnings were bogus and accounting ju=
gglery is the most charitable explanation. The company has formally acknowl=
edged that its audited statements of earnings for the last three years were=
 of no consequence! It appears that several limited partnerships (LJM and L=
JM2 in particular, apparently named after Star Wars film characters), in wh=
ich officers of Enron had substantive financial interests, were key element=
s in its concocted business numbers. Enron had till now gotten way with the=
 business equivalent of murder. To illustrate, in the matter of appointment=
 of key regulatory figures in the US, the California power debacle in which=
 the conservative California governor went as far as saying that nothing wo=
uld please him more to see Kenneth Lay in a prison cell with a fellow cellm=
ate greeting him with "Hi Honey, my name is Spike," and its international o=
perationsthe debacles in India, Indonesia, Nigeria etc, etc, the failures o=
f its very expensive forays into the broadband and water businesseswere in =
a sense forgivable. What was unforgivable was the ultimate crime of siphoni=
ng off shareholders' money through these limited partnerships and brazenly =
lying to Wall Street.

With a daily decline in its share prices ($37 to $7 in two weeks), the fail=
ure of white knights to emerge (such as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Holdings=
, on which Enron had pinned some hope), its bonds being only notionally abo=
ve junk status (trading in two weeks from 101 to 65 cents on the dollar) an=
d, consequently, the potential collapse of its trading business where it ac=
ts as a trusted counter party, Enron had no choice but to agree to what app=
ears to be a shotgun marriage with a rival, Dynegy, a fourth of its size. T=
he almost overnight surrender and the fact that the final price for Enron w=
as as low as $8 billion represents a collapse unparalleled in recent busine=
ss history.
=20
This merger, slated to occur over the next six to nine months, subject to a=
 series of caveats, may or may not take place as there could very well be s=
everal unpleasant surprises in store. Among these are the pending Securitie=
s and Exchange (SEC) investigation (in which the Enron counsel is a former =
colleague of the investigating officer!), the several dozen class-action su=
its filed over the last three weeks against Enron, its directors, Lay and s=
everal officers as well as its auditors Arthur Andersen, and, of course, ap=
propriate regulatory approval.

In my opinion, the key surprise may very well be the several as-yet secret =
limited partnerships. If these are ever made public, the reverberations thr=
oughout the US business spectrum may be too unpleasant. In any event, the c=
onsequences of these events do not appear to have sunk in in India. Given t=
he huge, and what appears to be a very difficult-to-service debt, of $22 bi=
llion from various forays that Enron has engaged in in the last three years=
 (raised from $15 billion the week before), it is likely a solution crafted=
 to the needs and limitations of all parties may be feasible given appropri=
ate spine. Spine on India's part, that is.The terms that were proposed by E=
nron for a settlement of the Dabhol issuea payment of $1.2 billion, now bro=
ught down to $850 millionare clearly unacceptable. The missile that Enron h=
as now aimed at India has not been comprehended either by the state apparat=
us or the media.
=20
It rests in an order issued by the London High Court, which, inter alia, pr=
ohibits the government of Maharashtra from even opening its mouth about Enr=
on, even in an Indian court or tribunal. There are several, in my opinion, =
historically unprecedented consequences of this. This craven, abject surren=
der of sovereignty is a result of a consent agreement the erstwhile BJP-Shi=
v Sena government signed a year after the fraudulent 'renegotiations'. This=
 is a truly unpardonable crime and should be sufficient reason to send the =
'renegotiators' to jail.

In any event, given a series of interests, inter alia the interests of Shar=
ad Pawar (who negotiated the first Enron contract) and consequently the pre=
sent state government, the danger that Indian financial institutions, in pa=
rticular IDBI, may simply go under for lending without any due diligence to=
 this over-invoiced project, the Damocles sword hanging over Maharashtra in=
 the form of the London High Court order and so on, it may be in the best i=
nterests of all parties concerned to iron out an appropriate transparent ag=
reement that has India's and the public interest at its core, a comprehensi=
ve settlement, given the effective non-existence of Enron at this moment in=
 history
