Let's look at  their lifestyle: 
No premarital sex. 
No oral sex.  Giving or  receiving.  Never. 
No booze.  None. 
No TV.  No cable TV.  
No Spice channel.  No Playboy channel. 
No Hooters. "What is this  Hooters of which you speak ?!?" 
No titty bars. 
No organized sports of  any kind.  That's right-no sports. 
The women have to wear baggy dresses  and veil's.  Women have 
to cover up everything! 
Very, very, very  few cars.  Camels.  Many camels. 
Sand.  Fucking sand  everywhere! 
More sand. 
Ever fish at an oasis? 
Rags for clothes and  hats. 
Bar-B-Q's are cooked over burning camel dung chips. 
Eating with  your right hand only-because you wipe your ass 
with your left hand.  
Constant wailing from the asshole next door ... no wait, 
is that  music?  Shit!  I can't tell. 
Oh, by the way, when you die it all  gets better!

TJ:

How many 1-800 phone numbers does power have? ( If any other than 24 Hr trading, please advise)
What is the number for 24 HR group? ( I will need to coordinate a cutover for this)
Do you know of any special phone needs for the weekend trading?  (The people on turrets will be fine, they pin in anywhere)

Any other thoughts or concerns are appreciated.

Dear Investor,

This little biotech company just may have THE ANSWER
to prostate cancer...

...and a lock on one of the largest -- and most
lucrative -- health markets of the Western world.
Best of all, its stock is what I call a  "Why the heck
not" investment.  It's low-priced -- you can pick up a
thousand shares for around $1,200 now.  And it has the
potential to MULTIPLY that small investment 10-to-20
TIMES over in the next couple years.

See why I call it "Why the heck not?"  Just a tiny
amount of risk capital can turn into a really nice
chunk of change.

Frankly, my worst expectations are for a NEAR-TERM
DOUBLE.  That happens and you can even sell half your
position, keep half -- and have none of your original
investment at risk.  Everything after that is gravy!

THAT'S THE BIOTECH GAME, my friend.  It's one of the
few ways left for the average guy to get stinking
rich.  So if you've got a little cash to spare -- and
have a love for tape-measure home runs -- you've got
to check this stock out.

Here's the story.

Gene sequencing and human cloning get all the
headlines, but a lot of the most compelling work in
biotech comes from much more "boring" fields.  This
little company -- for example -- is doing AMAZING
STUFF with common carbohydrate compounds.  In fact,
its experimental drug GBC-590 may prove to be one of
the biggest success stories of the decade.

LET ME STRESS the word "experimental."  It's not
approved yet -- it's still going through clinical
trials.  That's why the stock price is so low...but
that's also why you have a chance to multiply your
investment twenty fold -- if you get in now!

This drug may be experimental, but it's also on the
FAST-TRACK towards FDA-approval.  Management stepped
up the pace of clinical studies after initial results
proved very favorable.

In fact, Phase 1 results -- primarily used to show the
safety of a drug -- showed REMARKABLE BENEFITS against
prostate cancer.  It stabilized or reduced PSA
(prostate specific antigen) levels in 80% of the
patients, with advanced cancer, tested!  High PSAs, of
course, are a marker of prostate cancer -- and a sign
that the disease is spreading uncontrollably.

Today, there is no effective treatment that improves
the survival rates for men whose cancer continues to
spread -- even after surgery.  That's why this news is
so important.  It means new hope for patients who
thought they had none.

AND FOR INVESTORS like us, it means wealth potentially
beyond our wildest dreams.

Remember, clinical trials are still ongoing.  But GBC-
590 seems to work by attaching itself to receptor
points on individual cells, much like the space
shuttle docks at the orbiting space station.  Once
"locked in," this drug thwarts the typical metastatic
action -- that is, it stops the cancer from spreading!

Imagine the wealth-building potential!  But the story
doesn't stop there.

Animal-modeling with GBC-590 suggests a possible
BREAKTHROUGH in the treatment of pancreatic cancer,
which typically has a five-year death rate of 99%!
43% of mice survived past the 43-day benchmark versus
none given the most-commonly used drug for pancreatic
cancer.  And 33% of the GBC-590 mice were 100% CURED
of their tumors!

Phase II trials on human pancreatic and colorectal
cancer patients are now underway.  And any positive
news here should send this stock skyrocketing.

WHAT'S MORE, this biotech is not some one-trick pony.
One of its more interesting developments is CAN-296, a
new breakthrough against drug-resistant fungus,
including Aspergillus and Candida.  Pre-clinical
studies suggest it's very effective and extremely
fast-acting.  Icing on the cake!

I won't claim that everyone should own this stock.
It's an aggressive play, and no one should put a lot
of money in it.

But then again, you don't need a lot.  Just a small
investment now could well mushroom into a not-so-small
FORTUNE over the next several years.  I think it's
worth a look -- and a few thousand dollars, as well.

TRY A RISK-FREE trial subscription to my Forecasts &
Strategies advisory and I'll give you this company's
name NOW -- immediately, online.  You'll also get a
Special Introductory Report detailing all my top
current recommendations.

And trust me, they're not all biotech.  I've got a
host of stocks, funds, income vehicles and more that
are all TOP-NOTCH investments for times like these.

Best of all, when I say a "risk-free subscription," I
mean it.  Try Forecasts & Strategies for six full
months and see if I'm blowing smoke or making you
money.  If you don't like F&S -- if you're not getting
richer -- just say, "No thanks," and your subscription
doesn't cost you a dime.

That's an ironclad 6-month guarantee of total 100%
satisfaction.  So try Forecast & Strategies to see for
yourself the advantages I bring.  Go here now:

P.S.  I think this stock will make party chatter a lot
of fun.  Invest a thousand bucks and you could make
enough to buy a new car.  "Why the heck not?"  Click

The ARCHES will be taken down this weekend. We have a crew hired ( as we have
done in the past) to take them down. We use the proceeds from the ARCHES to
pay to take them down.

Thanks & Happy New Years

Don, the duck hunting went great.  We bagged over 30 ducks (between 6 guys).  They were a combination of pintail, teal, buffalo head, and blue bills.  

The guides provide the dog, decoys, blinds, transportation, and they call them in for you.  They will let you call if you want, but the guides are top notch.

My uncle and I are thinking of going down this weekend or the next.  Let me know if you are interested, and we will reserve you a spot with us. 

Lyle

Lyle,

Thanks for the note.  How did the hunt go?  Did you have to bring decoys?  How did the guides do callin' in the ducks?

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thanks,

Don, it was great talking to you about hunting and shooting today.  Below is the link to Central Flyway Outfitters (CFO).  They are a top notch guide service out of Winnie, Texas (near Beaumont) that specialize in duck and goose hunting.  They have hunting packages around $150 a gun (they offer corporate discounts as well).  All you need is a license, shells, gun, and waders:  they will take care of the transportation (4 wheelers), guide, and dog.  

I am heading down there tomorrow for a hunt with my uncle.  I will let you know how we do.  If you are interested I can arrange hunt on a future Saturday or Sunday morning.  Regards, Lyle

This is a message from Rusty Tidwell.  mgs
I hope everyone had a Merry Christmas.

My son, Marcus, and I would like to help out anyone who may need some
assistance in taking down their Christmas lights/decorations or straightening
up afterwards. I realize we have several elderly residents along with people
being "under the weather."

We would be glad to help, just give us call.

Happy New Years To All,

I have spoken with Calger about us going through the West Power contracts with his team next Tuesday through Friday.  They are gathering an extended set of information (including the items on the current matrix) on their top 25 exposures.  The top 25 exposures include the top exposures under Master agreements and in many cases include numerous contracts.  Chris said that the 26th exposure was about $10MM and one would need to get to about the 50th exposure to get below $1MM.  I asked him to forward down whatever they had completed to date so we could get educated and keep a central file.  He is also going to forward a call in number for a conference call tomorrow so we can begin to get educated on the current effort.

Lorraine Becker (ext. 31680) will be handling travel arrangements.  Please forward your credit card # so she can complete the reservations.  
(P.S. Piper is getting verification from Bowen regarding travel expenditures.)

Several discussions have been circulating regarding current Enron phone numbers and the need for new toll-free numbers the UBS East Power Group.

For the UBS Power Trading group (EAST):

  We can request new toll-free numbers (24 Hour, Fax and Scheduling) as per Kathy Link (UBS Houston 5-5418).  
	a. 	Don Baughman and I have discussed a few options for these numbers, but would welcome any input or related requirements you may be 				aware of prior to us initiating this.
	b.	We will establish these for East Power ASAP.   David Steiner (503-464-3701) will be the contact to facilitate this effort for the West Desk
   	

   Our current "853" numbers will probably be replaced by new "584" numbers(Kathy Link is working on this).  If this occurs, new numbers will be assigned to us.

   Our Current "800" numbers for 24-Hour, "Fax, and Scheduling can be forwarded  / transferred by the IT group to the Estate from our current phone turrets.

Let's discuss these numbers tomorrow, Tuesday morning (February 4th).

Thanks,

Corry Bentley

Best of the Web Today - December 18, 2001
By JAMES TARANTO
Osama bin Hidin'  http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/central/12/18/ret.afghan.attacks/index.html

Afghan fighters are conducting "cave by cave" searches for terror mastermind Osama bin Laden, CNN reports. Although anti-Taliban forces, with U.S. help, have more or less taken control of the Tora Bora region, there are hundreds of caves and "it's possible he could be dead in the bottom of one of them," says Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz.

Some have suggested that bin Laden has slipped across the border to Pakistan, and  United Press International  http://www.washingtontimes.com/world/20011218-29450475.htm  reports that country's border with Afghanistan remains porous, despite reassurances from officials in Islamabad that they've "sealed the border tight." "Pakistan's tribal areas are free-passage zones for Taliban and al Qaeda's foreign legionnaires escaping from Afghanistan," reports UPI's Arnaud de Borchgrave. "A visiting reporter was stopped once and when the U.S. passport was produced, the civilian security official made clear that Americans were 'not welcome.' When asked whether that went for Taliban, too, he answered, 'Taliban always welcome.' "

Wolfowitz issued a warning to Pakistan or any other country that might harbor bin Laden: "Any country in the world that would knowingly harbor bin Laden would be out of their minds. I think they have seen what happened to the Taliban and I think that is probably a pretty good lesson to people not to do that."

InstaPundit.com offers some additional, if fanciful, theories on Osama's whereabouts:

*** QUOTE ***

Alternate where's Osama theories: We killed him. We know he's dead. But there are lots of reasons for not telling the world. (1) we don't want to trigger any "sleepers" who might be waiting for just that news to act; (2) we don't want to anger the Saudis; (3) we want to maximize confusion among al Qaeda survivors--perhaps we were the ones broadcasting phony orders in Osama's voice to increase this--while we continue to round 'em up; (4) Osama's head, in brine, has been delivered to King Fahd with a message--if this happens again, it'll be yours; naturally, that's best not spread around.

Alternate alternate theories: he's alive and being interrogated on a U.S. warship; he's alive and being interrogated in Pakistan; he's alive and being interrogated in India.

Evidence for the above scenarios: none. But hey, they're all plausible and fun.

*** END QUOTE ***

A  Time  http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101011224-188561,00.html  article suggests one further theory:

*** QUOTE ***

Afghanistan was such a cozy home base for al-Qaeda. The network enjoyed luxuries like its own air-shuttle service, using the national airline Ariana to ship terrorist cargo and personnel, including Osama bin Laden's bodyguards and their families, between Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf or East Africa. Sometimes al-Qaeda agents would even slip in and out of other countries disguised as Ariana flight attendants, according to aviation sources.

*** END QUOTE ***

Next time you fly, especially if it's on Ariana, take a very close look at the stewardesses.

The Crying Game  http://www.nypost.com/news/worldnews/36992.htm

The New York Post, its front page blaring  CRYBABIES  http://www.nypost.com/images/front121801.gif , reports that "Osama bin Laden's vaunted al Qaeda fighters broke down in tears yesterday and begged not to be turned over to the Americans." The Post quotes a 17-year-old Kuwaiti named Khudaifa: "I haven't had a drink for two days. If you don't give me water, I will die." Ah what the heck--give the baby his bottle.

Come Out, Come Out, Wherever Omar  http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/12/18/walq118.xml&sSheet=/news/2001/12/18/ixhome.html

Also still missing is top Talib Mullah Mohammad Omar. London's Daily Telegraph reports he "is thought to holed up with hundreds of heavily armed men at a mountain hide-out in southern Afghanistan":

*** QUOTE ***

In the first detailed report of Mullah Omar's possible whereabouts, Haji Gullalai, a senior anti-Taliban commander, said witnesses' accounts placed the fugitive leader and up to 500 fighters in an area of hills and caves near Baghran village, 100 miles north west of Kandahar.

He said they had taken all their weapons, ammunition, vehicles and even office equipment as they fled Kandahar 12 days ago, when the city surrendered.

*** END QUOTE ***

As if it wasn't bad enough Omar ran his country into the ground and gave shelter to Osama bin Laden's gang of mass murderers, now he's pilfering too. Talk about adding insult to injury! Gullalai says he expects to hunt down Omar within a few days if the maniacal mullah doesn't surrender first.

Praise the Lords  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57448-2001Dec17.html

Britain's Law Lords, the country's highest court, have approved the extradition of Khaled al Fawwaz and two associates to the U.S. The men are accused of involvement in the 1998 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. Euro-weenies, however, could still delay justice; the alleged terrorists could appeal to the European Court of Human Rights.

When Life Gives You Yemen, Make Yemen Aid--II  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20011218/wl/attacks_yemen_al_qaida_1.html

Yemeni special forces have attacked an al Qaeda hideout in Marib province, some 100 miles east of the capital of San'a. "The bombing came after members of the Adida tribe refused to hand over to authorities at least five men suspected of belonging to bin Laden's al-Qaida terrorist network," the Associated Press reports. The  Arabic News  http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/011217/2001121708.html  reports that Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh "has stressed he has got guarantees during his visit to Washington that Yemen is not targeted in the terrorism fighting campaign." Those guarantees, we assume, are predicated upon Yemeni cooperation.

Our Friends the Saudis  http://www.dawn.com/2001/12/17/int2.htm

Yemen may be cooperating, but the Saudis are as useless as ever. Agence France-Presse reports the Saudi interior minister, Prince Nayef ibn Abdel Aziz, is insisting there is no proof of Saudi involvement in the Sept. 11 hijackings--even though 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi citizens. "It's true that Saudi citizens were in the planes, but who can be certain whether they were behind the attacks?" Nayef says. "Until now, no one has found me any proof of this."

The New Republic  http://www.tnr.com/122401/kaplan122401.html  traces Saudi efforts to divert attention from its culpability and toward Israel:

*** QUOTE ***

During July and August, [Crown Prince] Abdullah sent Bush several letters, each more shrill than the last, beseeching the president to "pull the reins on Mr. Sharon," as an Abdullah spokesman describes the correspondence. According to a White House adviser, one of these letters threatened a return to the "summer of 1973," a reference to the Arab front that united against Israel prior to the Yom Kippur War. . . .

Then came September 11. Given that 15 of the hijackers were Saudi, one might have expected the monarchy to be somewhat chastened. Far from it. "After September 11," a senior administration official explains, "[the Saudis] just wanted to change the topic from themselves. So they turned the volume up even louder."

*** END QUOTE ***

It was partly in response to Saudi pressure, TNR's Lawrence Kaplan contends, that Colin Powell made a speech endorsing Palestinian statehood and the Bush administration sent a special envoy, Anthony Zinni, to the Middle east in hopes of negotiating a cease-fire. But the Saudis appear to have overplayed their hand. After the latest round of Arab barbarity, the administration had little choice but to join Israel in its fight against terror.

But were the Saudis ever interested in resolving the Palestinian problem? This  Reuters  http://famulus.msnbc.com/FamulusIntl/reuters12-18-023115.asp  dispatch suggests not. It reports that a Saudi newspaper--presumably reflecting the government's views--denounced Yasser Arafat for giving a speech calling for an end to violence against Israel:

*** QUOTE ***

"In his speech, he (Arafat) pledged to pursue those behind the martyrdom operations which he called suicide attacks. He also pledged to pursue Palestinian fighters and to close down Hamas and Islamic Jihad institutions," al-Watan said in an editorial, referring to two militant Palestinian groups.

"Is there a name for all of this other than surrender?" it asked.

*** END QUOTE ***

Arafat's speech is plainly a desperation move, and it may come too late to make a difference. But the Saudis' reaction to it both reflects a blind hatred of Jews and suggests they may want to keep the Palestinian conflict alive so as to divert attention from their own repressive policies at home and support for terror and Islamic fundamentalism abroad.

The Terrorists Aren't Listening  http://www.jpost.com/Editions/2001/12/18/News/News.40139.html

The Jerusalem Post reports Arafat's speech didn't go over well among Palestinian terrorist groups either. Hamas and Islamic Jihad issued a leaflet rejecting Arafat's "call for an end to all armed activities and terror attacks and called for a continuation of the intifada until the end of the occupation. They also vowed to continue suicide attacks and denounced the US as the enemy of the Palestinian people, threatening to target US targets in the future."

CNN reports  http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/meast/12/18/iraq.conference/index.html  Saddam Hussein is also trying to get a piece of the Palestinian action, urging a meeting of Arab leaders in Mecca "to discuss the issue of aggression on Palestinians." In National Review Online,  Victor Davis Hanson  http://www.nationalreview.com/hanson/hanson121801.shtml  pens a dyslogy to Arafat and Saddam:

*** QUOTE ***

The bleak situation for these walking anachronisms is worse than the mere fall of Communism and the end to state-organized anti-Americanism. The United States not only defeated Marxists, but successfully spread its own culture abroad. The result is that South America, Asia, and Eastern Europe rather like free elections, capitalism, and secular tolerance. For all the brutishness of the new globalism, even its most recalcitrant critics welcome international banking, communications, air travel, and intellectual exchange.

In other words, outside of Mr. Arafat's own close circle and a few sycophants in Baghdad, hardly any worker in any state wishes to see continual suicide bombers and poison gas plants on the evening news when there is a chance to catch a Schwarznegger movie, read spirited newspapers over coffee, and put a little away for a VCR. Indeed, even individual Arabs at Ground Zero in Jerusalem and Baghdad--if they could speak freely without repercussions--would perhaps prefer an end to their own state's sanctioned terror and a chance to join the rest of the world in the effort at living comfortably and securely.

*** END QUOTE ***

Real Soon Now  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20011218/ts/mideast_dc_470.html

President Bush has signed a waiver delaying for six months the congressionally mandated move of the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. But he "said he was committed to the move in the future," Reuters reports.

Ayatollah You So  http://www.irna.com/newshtm/eng/26132659.htm

Bill Clinton says Iran is a democracy. That at least is how the official Iranian news agency, IRNA, spins a  speech  http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/news_comment/dimbleby/print_clinton.shtml#  he gave on Sunday.

Cheers for Chelsea  http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=special&s=swift20011204

Chelsea Clinton can't be all bad. After all, The Nation has published an article attacking the erstwhile first daughter, who "has been waging war from behind the newly reinforced bullet-proof glass windows of her Oxford dorm room. She and her Secret Service guards disrupted an antiwar rally in the town hall, heckling the speakers and waving American flags."

Well, bully for Chelsea (though does she really still have Secret Service protection nearly a year after her father left office?). We guess attacking her was not that high a priority at The Nation, though, since the assignment fell to one  Daniel Swift  http://www.thenation.com/directory/view.mhtml?handle=swift_daniel , a lowly "former Nation intern" and "freelance writer."

Britain's Fifth Column  http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,2001570010-2001582454,00.html

The delightfully named Hassan Butt, a British Muslim who says he's recruited hundreds of Taliban fighters, "could face prosecution under anti-terrorism laws," the Times of London reports. Hmm, could Marin mujahid John Walker's father have been referring to this character when he said he wanted to give his son a "little kick in the butt"?

The Answer, My Friend, Is Blowing in the Wind  http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99991697

Here's a possible explanation for those two mysterious anthrax cases: The victims may have inhaled wind-blown spores. Debora MacKenzie writes in The New Scientist:

*** QUOTE ***

Two of the five US anthrax deaths so far had no known association with contaminated mail. The two women lived in the Bronx in New York City, and in Oxford, Connecticut. But both places lie on a straight line running 47 degrees northeast from Trenton.

Martin Furmanski, a researcher based in Newport Beach, California, says this exactly matches the wind bearing on 9 October--220 and 230 degrees--the day the anthrax-laced letters were processed in Trenton. The wind was also "brisk", he says, between 11 and 21 kilometres per hour [seven to 13 miles an hour].

*** END QUOTE ***

Where's Geraldo?  http://cbsnews.com/now/story/0,1597,321552-412,00.shtml

CBS News reports that Geraldo Rivera, Fox News Channel's most obnoxious on-air personality, "was hundreds of miles from the site of a friendly fire incident he reported on":

*** QUOTE ***

Rivera reported in a Dec. 6 piece that he became emotional and choked up while standing on the "hallowed ground" in Afghanistan where "friendly fire took so many of our, our men and the mujahedeen yesterday." Rivera said he had recited the Lord's Prayer.

But, according to a report on the  Baltimore Sun  http://www.sunspot.net/features/bal-to.geraldo15dec15.story 's Internet site, Rivera admitted that he was several hundred miles from the site--outside Kandahar--where three Americans were killed on Dec. 5 by an errant U.S. bomb.

Rivera told the Sun he had mixed up the incident he report on with another "friendly fire" incident, in Tora Bora. "But, according to the Sun, Pentagon information shows the Tora Bora incident occurred at least three days after Rivera's Dec. 6 report."
 
Meanwhile,  The Weekly Standard  http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/000/700auxyl.asp  notes that Geraldo made a cameo in a news photo from Afghanistan.

Writing in the Toronto Globe and Mail, Spider Robinson, a Canadian science-fiction author, opposes antiterrorism laws on the grounds that some of his best friends are  terrorists:

*** QUOTE ***

One man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter: Nelson Mandela would still be considered a terrorist, if he hadn't won. Just about every friend I had in the 1960s would have qualified as a potential threat to national security under the vaguely defined parameters of [Canadian antiterror bills] C-36 and C-42; today they are, without exception, assets to their community, society and culture. The ones who aren't in jail, anyway.

Justice Delayed  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A60204-2001Dec18.html

Honorary Paris citizen Mumia Abu-Jamal, who murdered Philadelphia policeman Daniel Faulkner, won't be executed anytime soon. Judge William Yohn, a federal trial judge, has thrown out Abu-Jamal's death sentence and ordered a new sentencing hearing.

Correction
Jenna Bush wasn't offered $12 million to appear in an "antiterrorism movie," as we  said yesterday  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001610#jenna . Twelve million dollars is the budget for the entire movie. Sorry about that, Jenna.

Rogue Elephant Trainer?  http://www.contracostatimes.com/news/stories_news/circus_20011218.htm

The courts in San Jose, Calif., continue to break new ground in the protection of fauna.  Earlier this year  http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95000827#dog  a San Jose judge sentenced a man to three years in prison for killing a dog. Now, the Contra Costa Times reports, an elephant trainer is on trial in San Jose, charged with violating "a unique California law that prohibits elephant handlers from inflicting 'physical punishment resulting in damage, scarring or breakage of skin.' "

Mark Gebel allegedly "lunged at a 30-year-old Asian elephant with a hooked stick known as an ankus, or bull hook," the paper reports. "Investigators later found a 'nickel sized red bloody spot on her skin behind her left front leg.' " Gebel's lawyer notes that the elephant in question weighs 8,000 pounds and stands more than eight feet tall. The wound, he says, "is the size of a pin prick."

Once again we have had some vandalism in CCV.  It is a shame to put all of
your hard work into lighting up the yard and have you decorations vandalized.
 Police reports have been made and extra patrols are being added.  Please
call the police and let us know if you see or have any vandalism.  This time
Peggy Zahler has had her light wires cut twice.  It is not the time taken to
put up the lights or the money and time required to get new lights, it is the
aggravation and the simple feeling that you are being taken advantage of.  We
take pride int the fact that Clear Creek Village attracts a lot of attention
during the holidays because you all do such a wonderful job of decorating.
Please be watchful and call League City PD.
Thank you.  Mary G. Strickland

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

ents a full and expansive range of outsourced IT and back-office services. =
HYPD?s first ITC is designed around an AT&T Dedicated Entrance Facility wit=
h on-net redundant fiber provisioning offering scalable bandwidth up to an =
OC-48 and beyond.  Th! is comprehensive Tier-1 hosting center enables HYPD =
to offer clients complete end-to-end IT services in a fully redundant and s=
eamless environment.  Through recently developed Hyperserve connection prod=
ucts, HYPD has been able to improve the functionality of its services by of=
fering clients remote server appliances that connect to the ITC.  Bolstered=
 by strategic alliances and strong working relationships with major players=
 in technology and telecommunications, including Microsoft, Intel, AT&T, an=
d Great Plains, HYPD has demonstrated a superior ability to cater to the un=
ique needs and limitations of small-to-medium sized businesses, effectively=
 creating a business model that partners HYPDS? success with that of its cl=
ients.  Utilizing this innovative approach, HYPD should be able to grow its=
 business in conjunction with client business growth, and position itself a=
s the ITSP provider of choice for an emerging market of small and mi! d siz=
ed companies.  Within the Houston region, and with this small and mid sized=
 target market, HYPD is well positioned to grow its business substantially =
over the near to intermediate term and achieve niche market dominance withi=
n an appreciable time period.     HYPD has recently aimed its full-service =
IT hosting business model towards the unique needs and growth strategies of=
 small to medium-sized businesses, a rapidly growing market that is relativ=
ely undeserved by major IT service providers such as Level 3, UUNet, and Sp=
rint.    HYPD has based this approach around the potentially lucrative, lon=
g-term revenue streams afforded through association with growing companies.=
  For example, HYPD has recently initiated long-term Hypersource IT hosting=
 arrangements with Eagle Wireless International and Premiere Media Group.  =
Eagle Wireless is a leading supplier of broadband wired and wireless equipm=
ent and services for a variety of markets, including the Internet, digital =
set-top boxes, and wireless convergence products, and is anticipated to rea=
ch national market penetration within the next several years.  As the clien=
t company grows its business over the next several years, the highly scalab=
le nature of the Hyperdynamics? IT hosting model will enable the Company to=
 offer additional needed services readily while retaining high margins.  By=
 being able to refine and scale! up client IT services in a quick time peri=
od, and for minimal additional expenses, HYPD has opened up access to signi=
ficant and recurring long-term revenue streams from smaller and mid-sized b=
usiness clients.  Moreover, HYPD offers client companies an unprecedented d=
egree of personalized attention and customization, when compared to major n=
ational ITSP providers.      The infrastructure of HYPD?S first ITC, design=
ed to support end-to-end ITSP services can also be leveraged for easy and s=
mart diversification. With its recent acquisition of Seacon Computer System=
s, Inc. (SCS), HYPD has been able to enter the vertical seismic data manage=
ment market. Thus, in addition to its horizontal industry approach for ITSP=
 services, new and innovative vertically oriented business opportunities of=
fering diversified revenue streams are coming to HYPD.    For example, SCS =
is a seismic data management company that has developed a unique and cost s=
aving method for transferring seismic and geologic data for oil and gas com=
panies on 8mm and 9mm magnetic tapes to state of the art DVD (optical) stor=
age.  The current methods of storing this type of data on magnetic tapes ar=
e time consuming, prohibitively expensive, outdated (the technology is over=
 40 years old), and inefficient.  SCS will enable clients in the expanding =
oil and gas industry to migrate the estimated 3 billion magnetic tapes that=
 degrade in 8-20 years to DVD storage, with an expected lifespan of over 50=
 years, at a cheaper price point and with easy accessibility.  The SCS acqu=
isition, moreover, provides an ideal strategic fit to the core data center =
business of HYPD, and opens up significant and highly lucrative revenue str=
eams.  SCS will derive revenue! s from three principal sources: (1) convers=
ion of existing tapes to superior DVD storage technologies; (2) accessing D=
VD data through HYPD?s ITC facility; and (3) a vertical ASP approach to rem=
ote seismic interpretation processing of data through the Houston ITC using=
 technical and hardware support from Intel.  In addition to opening up an i=
nnovative and new business through the SCS acquisition, HYPD believes that =
it will be able to apply this type of vertical ASP approach towards other t=
arget industries, such as insurance services, either through additional acq=
uisitions or joint ventures.      HYPD?s projected revenue and business gro=
wth will be largely driven by several principal catalysts, including: (1) c=
ontinuing to implement its full service IT hosting solution, Hypersource, t=
hrough the Houston-based, state-of-the-art Integrated Technology Center and=
 future planned ITC?s in regional markets; (2) orienting its ITSP solutions=
 and services towards the unique needs of expanding small-and-medium sized =
businesses; (3) entering into long-term, recurring revenue contracts by gro=
wing with its clients, and providing additional services at higher margins =
as these client businesses expand; (4) opening up new and lucrat! ive reven=
ue streams through its subsidiary SCS, and integrating this business opport=
unity through internal synergies with its core IT hosting and services busi=
ness; and (5) positioning itself within a competitively underserved marketp=
lace for ITSP services and products for small and mid-sized business client=
s.      VALUATION   Consolidation within the ITSP industry has been a consi=
stent theme within the past several years.  Major ITSP hosting players have=
 been acquired in a series of recognizable transactions.  Notable among the=
se has been the acquisition of Verio by NTT, and the acquisition of Digex b=
y WorldCom.  Within the remaining players in the IT hosting industry, remai=
ning players have been devastated by the decline in valuations accorded, ba=
sed on consistently increasing earnings deficits and increased cost of serv=
ices provided.  In addition, these players have suffered due to aggressive =
acquisition strategies undertaken during the previous two years that have n=
ot proven out as significant growth catalysts and increased debt structures=
.  By contrast, HYPD has pursued a conservative growth strategy with limite=
d acquisitions carefully calculated to directly and immediately benefit agg=
regate revenues and earnings.  Relative to comparative companies within the=
 ITSP industry, HYPD could realize superior growth in business and earnings=
 over the near-to-intermediate term period.  A grouping of comparable compa=
nies within this sector currently trades at an average price to sales multi=
ple of 2.70 X.  On a forward looking basis, using FY 2003 revenue and earni=
ngs estimates for the Company (fiscal year 2003 starts July 1,2002), this r=
epresents roughly a 8-fold premium to current trading levels.  Thus, when a=
pplying the comparative grouping?s average price to earnings and price to r=
evenue multiples to HYPD we can arrive at a relative valuation of $4.30 per=
 share over the next 12 months.         SUMMARY   Aggressive investors look=
ing for above-average return potential on a portion of their investment cap=
ital should give HYPD a serious look.  Management of the Company, headed by=
 CEO Kent Watts, are highly talented and educated in their technical areas.=
  We believe HYPD has assembled an astute, goal oriented, sophisticated tea=
m committed to HYPD becoming very, very successful.  Investors at current l=

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

There is a pretty large group of us going to the  Firehouse for New Year's eve this year.  Most of the people that attended  the Christmas party and most of the people who went to Schroeder Hall last  year.  Anyway just wanted to spread the word to a few of you who may not  have gotten the word.  Tickets are $25 apiece and probably need to be  purchased before the end of next week.  Roger thinks it will sell out  before Christmas.  Hope everyone has a great day.  Joe if you would  like for us to buy you a ticket let me know.
 
Thanks
 
Scott T.

Dear Investor,

I'm writing to expose the biggest lie in technology
today...

...one that has individual investors completely in the
dark about an opportunity of immense proportions.  A
LOW-RISK tech stock that can easily DOUBLE your money
by this time next year -- then make your fortune
several times over in the years to come.

I've just put the finishing touches on an Urgent
Profit Bulletin detailing this opportunity
and in just a bit, I'll tell you how to get your
FREE copy.

But first, back to technology's biggest lie.  I'm
talking about the so-called "glut" of fiber optic
cable.  Here's the REAL story:

WHEN the World Trade Center got hit, the Internet
slowed down -- very noticeably slowed down.  In fact,
it nearly came to a grinding halt!  That means there
isn't nearly enough capacity or redundancy built into
the system to accommodate a blip in demand.

Sources tell me that the government is very worried
about this problem.  After all, this is the second
time it's happened.  Back in July, a tunnel fire in
Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl for two full
days.

That means our communications systems -- and therefore
our economy -- are very, very vulnerable.

Ten years ago, it wouldn't have mattered.  But today,
commerce and security is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on those
systems.  Virtually nothing moves without it.  That's
how banks and brokerages transfer funds...how
dispatchers route fleets of trucks...how many Americans
get paid through direct deposit.

And we are closer to the BREAKING POINT than 99.9% of
Americans even begin to understand.  Here's one
example.

Qwest -- one of America's biggest carriers -- recently
said they're 60% loaded on their network.  That
doesn't sound too bad...until you understand how these
networks operate.  You can't load a network much past
65%.  In fact, 70% is virtually CATASTROPHIC --
because the network spends so much time searching for
open channels, it doesn't spend any time actually
sending packets of information.

The system locks.  Communications stops.  The nation
comes to a standstill.

AMERICA IS FALLING BEHIND the rest of the developed
world.  Internet traffic systems currently run faster
in Australia, Europe and even South America.  That's
because we push out more data than everyone else --
but we're not increasing capacity at anywhere near the
needed rate.

We've got to catch up -- and we've got to catch up
fast!  Otherwise business, the economy and our
national security all go in the CRAPPER.

BUT WHY do we have this capacity problem amidst a
"fiber glut?"  Because  95% of all the fiber that has
ever been laid is "dark" -- that is, it's not
activated.  And the company I'm recommending is the #1
supplier of the components needed to do the job.  I'm
looking at a DOUBLE -- possibly a TRIPLE by this time
next year.  And I fully expect to multiply our money
five-times over by 2007.  In fact, this stock truly
has "ten-bagger" potential!

At the height of the boom, this company's stock was
nearly 20-times higher.  So what changed?  Spending on
communications networks dried up.  Now the government
is ready to pump $100 billion in emergency spending
into the economy; interest rates are practically zero;
and the need isn't just vital for the economy anymore
-- it's a question of NATIONAL SECURITY!

Please don't miss out.  You'll kick yourself big-time
if you miss out. Get this company's name -- and full
details -- in my urgent profit bulletin: 5-Times
Richer By 2007.  It's yours FREE, simply for accepting
a 100% RISK-FREE trial subscription to my TECHNOLOGY
INVESTING advisory.

TAKE a full six months to measure the value of my
advice for yourself.  Don't like what you see...don't
make the profits you want, just cancel, and your
subscription doesn't cost you a dime.   That's reason
enough to give it a try.  Because if I'm right -- and
I'm staking my reputation and my own money on this
call -- you can double your money, at least, in 12
months...and make your fortune several times over in the
coming years.

Please don't miss out.  Give yourself a chance.  At
least take a look at TECHNOLOGY INVESTING to see what
you think.  Our unusual six-month guarantee of total
satisfaction means my advisory costs you nothing if
you don't 100% approve.

TECHNOLOGY INVESTING

P.S.  The longer you wait, the more profits you MISS
OUT on.  This stock has a long ways to run -- but it's
already UP 43% since October 1st, in recognition of
this company's vital new role in national security.

Dark fiber does no good.  Actual carrying capacity is
strained to the limits.  And get this -- data traffic is
DOUBLING every year now.  That means a network
running at 63% of capacity needs to double its load by
this time next year just to keep up.  That's why the
fiber must be lit.  That's why the fiber will be lit.
Click here to take advantage of this opportunity now.

Kathy,

We are requesting three new numbers for UBS Warburg Energy to replace the (soon to be) Enron Estate numbers.

If possible, a 927 (WAR) or 827 (UBS) prefix and sequential numbers is desired.  For example, our search showed 1-866-927-1401 and 1-866-927-1402 are available.

2)  Also, we need a local number for a dedicated fax line.

Subject:	Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Bad-dream Shotwell,

I got your e-mail address from Andrea Korth Walters the other day.  I
tried to get a hold of you earlier in the year, to no avail.  Just
wanted to catch up, and go drink a beer and eat a cheeseburger.

Doing fine down here in Houston.  I bought a house in League City.  In
addition, I asked Shannon to marry me but that fell through during the
summer.  We are trying to see if we can salvage any of the relationship.
I am doing well at Enron, managing the real-time power trading desk and
trading.  Enron, as you have seen in the paper, is experiencing some
trouble.  We are reasonably sure we will merge with Dynegy in mid to
late 2002.  Family is doing well; my sister is about to have her second
baby.  Travis is back from his year and a half tour in Europe, and took
a position with Cemex as an account manager.  Dad is about 3/4 retired
and he and mom are doing a fair amount of hunting & fishing.  Travis & I
are gonna spend Thanksgiving in West Texas, deer hunting.

How's life in Hooterville?  I heard that you are full on retired!
FANTASTIC!  What are you doing these days to keep yourself busy?
Hopefully consuming large quantities of beer & tequila and blowing you
eardrums out with Jimmy Buffett!

Tell when you are not busy and I will drive up, or have you down to the
house and the bayhouse.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Drop me a line when you have a chance!

Adios,

financial crisis, came hours after the country's economy minister stepped
down.

"Medical Terms"
 
Two Texans were having the blue-plate special at their favorite watering
hole when they heard an awful choking sound. They turned around to see a
lady a few bar stools down turning blue from wolfing down an Armadillo
burger too fast. 
 
The first Texan said to the other, "Think we ought to help?" 
 
"Yep," said the second Texan. 
 
The first Texan got up and walked over to the lady and asked, "Can you
breathe?" 
 
She shook her head no. 
 
"Can you speak?" he asked. 
 
She shook her head no again. 
 
With that, he helped her to her feet, lifted up her skirt and started to
lick her butt. She was so shocked, she coughed up the obstruction and
began to breathe, with great relief. 
 
The first Texan turned back to his friend and said, "Funny how that Hind
Lick Maneuver works every time!"

Best of the Web Today - December 21, 2001
By JAMES TARANTO
Our Friends the Saudis  http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20011221-17924224.htm

The Pentagon has conducted "a more leisurely review" of the Osama bin Laden videotape, the Associated Press reports. One of the translators, George Michael, says the new translation came up with "a whole bunch of names." He lists three of them: Nawaq Alhamzi, Salem Alhamzi and Wail Alshehri, all of whom were among the Sept. 11 hijackers.

ABC News  http://abcnews.go.com/sections/wnt/WorldNewsTonight/OBLtape_missing011220.html  and  CNN  http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/12/20/ret.bin.laden.translation/index.html  have both commissioned their own translations of the tape. ABC reports:

*** QUOTE ***

The new translation uncovers statements that could be embarrassing to the government of Saudi Arabia, a very important U.S. ally. Bin Laden's visitor, Khalid al Harbi, a Saudi dissident, claims that he was smuggled into Afghanistan by a member of Saudi Arabia's religious police.

He also tells bin Laden that in Saudi Arabia, several prominent clerics--some with connections to the Saudi government--made speeches supporting the attacks on America.

"Right at the time of the strike on America, he gave a very moving speech, Sheikh Abdulah al Baraak," bin Laden said on the tape. "And he deserves thanks for that."

Sheikh al Baraak, to whom the visitor refers, is a professor at a government university and a member of an influential council on religious law.

*** END QUOTE ***

CNN says that bin Laden identifies nine of the 19 hijackers, and that at least one of the Saudi clerics whose names were omitted from the official translation "was possibly a government official."

Meanwhile, the  New York Times  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/21/international/middleeast/21SAUD.html  (link requires registration) reports Saudi officials are griping about a "slanderous campaign" against them in the American media: "In trying to smooth over any disagreements, officials from both countries have found it convenient to blame the press, but in Saudi Arabia that blame has been particularly pointed at what most Saudis interpret to be a Jewish lobby that controls the American media."

A Stand Against Pakistani Terror  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/21/international/asia/21PREX.html

Although Pakistan is a nominal ally in the war against Islamic terrorists, President Bush is freezing the assets of Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistani terrorist group believed to have been behind last week's attack on the Indian Parliament. "Mr. Bush portrayed his action as one intended to support both India and Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, a key ally in the war in Afghanistan," the New York Times reports. But  Agence France-Presse  http://www.hindustantimes.com/nonfram/211201/dlfor57.asp  quotes Mahmood Ghazi, Pakistan's minister for religious affairs, as saying "the freezing of accounts could be the result of some misunderstanding about Lashkar-e-Taiba."

The Times quotes a "senior aide" as saying of the freezing: "We would be hypocritical if we didn't do it." Charges of hypocrisy have already been heard in the Indian press. Under the headline "Double Standards Inc.,"  Outlook India  http://www.outlookindia.com/full.asp?fname=powell&fodname=20011221&sid=1  rehearses a series of quotes from Secretary of State Colin Powell. Sample: "We hope that India will share all the information that they have acquired concerning this tragedy in their parliament building in New Delhi with the Pakistanis, who have condemned the attack and are anxious to cooperate with us, with our FBI."

The Hindu  http://www.hinduonnet.com/stories/2001122101110100.htm , an Indian newspaper, reports that another Pakistani terror group, Jaish-e-Mohammad, has threatened to carry out attacks in major Indian cities which, according to its spokesman, would be 'shocking.' " J-e-M, however, denies involvement in the Parliament attack. The  Daily Telegraph  http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/12/21/upaki.xml&sSheet=/portal/2001/12/21/ixport.html , meanwhile, reports India is recalling its ambassador to Islamabad and cutting off rail and bus links between the two countries.

Our Friends the Chinese  http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20011221-95780908.htm

"China continued to supply arms to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist even after the group began the September 11 attack on America," the Washington Times reports, citing a "senior U.S. official":

*** QUOTE ***

The official said that a week after the terrorist attack, the ruling Taliban and the al Qaeda fighters embedded among them, received a shipment of Chinese-made SA-7 missiles. The shoulder-fired anti-aircraft weapons are similar to the U.S. Stinger.

*** END QUOTE ***

The official, who apparently has a gift for understatement says, as the Times puts it, that "the shipment raises serious questions about Beijing's pledge to help fight terrorism."

The Hunt Goes On  http://news.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/12/21/wpak21.xml&sSheet=/news/2001/12/21/ixnewstop.html

The Telegraph reports that "the Pakistani army fought with escaped al-Qa'eda prisoners for a second day yesterday as the government intensified the hunt for Osama bin Laden and his associates in its own tribal areas." The report adds:

*** QUOTE ***

Afghan border officials told The Telegraph that hundreds of Arabs, who had fled into the Paracinar area after the fall of Tora Bora had doubled back into the mountains of eastern Afghanistan.

The al-Qa'eda fighters were said to have massed at important terrorist bases in Paktia province, which is just south of Ningahar province, the site of the Tora Bora mountain redoubt.

*** END QUOTE ***

The  Washington Times  http://www.washtimes.com/national/20011221-2457690.htm  reports that restrictive rules of engagement have kept U.S. special-operations troops from firing on some al Qaeda terrorists:

*** QUOTE ***

A senior military official said the covert warriors must seek approval from U.S. Central Command before firing on people they identify as al Qaeda fighters trying to flee Afghanistan. The Americans are free to fire if they feel threatened or when raiding enemy compounds.

In communicating on secure radios through the chain of command, the commandos must "tell how many people there are, which way they are moving and why they think they are al Qaeda," said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

This official estimated that scores of al Qaeda tracked by U.S. troops have made it safely to Pakistan the past week because approval to fire was not given promptly or not given at all.

What's Saddam Up To?  http://www.msnbc.com/news/676183.asp

MSNBC picks up a Vanity Fair report with "an alleged former brigadier general in Iraq's Mukhabarat intelligence service about the secret commando force which he said was trained in 'sabotage, urban warfare, hijacking and murder.' ":

*** QUOTE ***

According to Vanity Fair, defector Abu Zeinab al-Qurairy, whom it described as former close aide to Saddam Hussein's son Uday, administered a 1,200-strong commando force called "The Strikers." At Uday's orders, he told Vanity Fair, he put together a team of 30 "strikers" and gave them false identities with the aid of a corrupt official in the United Arab Emirates.

He told the magazine the group has vanished and could be anywhere. Al-Qurairy said he believed Iraq was involved in the Sept. 11 attacks carried out by teams that remained undercover for years in the west.

*** END QUOTE ***

James Robbins  http://www.nationalreview.com/contributors/robbins122101.shtml  argues in National Review Online that Saddam is in trouble:

*** QUOTE ***

He is beginning to understand that this time the United States means business. . . . This time the strategic correlation of forces is moving against him, slowly but with increasing momentum. The United States and its allies are flush with certain victory in Afghanistan. Saddam had no doubt counted on the same things al Qaeda had hoped for, a bloody ground struggle in which the United States would be humbled, Muslim solidarity against Crusaders and Jews, and anti-Western riots in major Middle Eastern cities. But not only did the Taliban turn out to be a paper tiger, Afghanistan has been a proving ground for a new American operational approach towards inconvenient regimes--isolate the target state diplomatically, build up the internal opposition, insert special forces, bring on the air power, dislodge the enemy's conventional forces, get them on the run, pummel them, send in the Marines, and let the opposition do the rest.

Osama's Nukes?  http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=20122001-044449-5310r

A pair of UPI dispatches report on the possibility that al Qaeda has nuclear weapons. The FBI is taking the possibility seriously, but key members of Congress disagree about the likelihood of a bin Laden bomb. "If you asked me if bin Laden really had these weapons, I would say, probably not, but, on the other hand, I wouldn't be the least surprised if there were a nuclear explosion in Israel or the United States," Rep. Chris Shays, a Connecticut Republican and chairman of the House subcommittee on national security, tells UPI. But the  second dispatch  http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=20122001-044906-9007r  quotes Rep. Curt Weldon, the Pennsylvania Republican who chairs the Armed Services subcommittee on research and development: "The question is whether or not bin Laden has had access to nuclear material. I think it is better than a 50-50 chance that he does."

Our Friends the FAA  http://www.startribune.com/stories/1576/913687.html

The Minneapolis Star Tribune reports on the tip that led to the arrest of "20th hijacker" Zacarias Moussaoui. A flight instructor from the Pan Am International Flight Academy in the Twin Cities suburb of Eagan, Minn., became suspicious and called the FBI when Moussaoui enrolled in lessons to fly a jumbo jet. "Do you realize how serious this is?" the paper quotes the instructor as asking an FBI agent. "This man wants training on a 747. A 747 fully loaded with fuel could be used as a weapon!"

Here's the really eye-popping part of the report:

*** QUOTE ***

Besides alerting the FBI about Moussaoui, the school's Phoenix office called the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) early this year about another student--Hani Hanjour, who was believed to be the pilot of the plane that flew into the Pentagon on Sept. 11. The school had raised questions about Hanjour's limited ability to speak English, the universal language of aviation.

An FAA representative sat in on a class to observe Hanjour, who was from Saudi Arabia, and discussed with school officials finding an Arabic-speaking person to help him with his English.

What's on That Ship?  http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_1723000/1723574.stm

British antiterrorism police are searching a cargo ship in the English channel, the BBC reports. The ship originated in the Indian Ocean island nation of Mauritius, and cops acted on "a credible tip-off" to seize the ship. A preliminary search didn't find anything, but "a second search which may take several days has now begun." Police say they're looking for "terrorist paraphernalia which was bin Laden-related," but they won't be more specific.

'I'm Fed Up With Being Called an Anti-Semite'  http://argument.independent.co.uk/regular_columnists/deborah_orr/story.jsp?story=111165

Deborah Orr, a columnist for London's left-wing Independent newspaper, writes a bizarre defense of France's ambassador to London, who, as we  noted yesterday  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001622#merde , writer Barbara Amiel quoted as making vulgar comments about Israel:

*** QUOTE ***

I'm getting fed up with being called an anti-Semite. And the more fed up I get, the more anti-Semitic I sound. If the likes of Ms Amiel continue to insist that everyone with a word to say against Israel is an anti-Semite, she is going to find one day that the world is once more divided neatly between anti-Semites and Jews.

That sounds like an anti-Semitic threat. It's not. It's the last thing I want. However, potential, but conditional, sympathisers are alienated so much by Zionist rhetoric that they start singing from what sounds like the same songsheet as the anti-Semite conspiracy theorists. Which I think is what has happened to the French ambassador. The only people who will be lathered into apoplexy by Mr Bernard's remarks are the very people who need to be keeping the coolest of heads right now. But Israelis, and the most committed of friends of Israel, are very far from doing that.

Cashing in on 9/11  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/nm/20011220/bs/attack_lawsuit_dc_1.html

Ellen Mariani, a New Hampshire woman whose husband was on the plane that hit 2 World Trade Center, is suing United Airlines, alleging that the airline "breached its duty to care for the safety of the passengers on Flight 175." She's represented by the Nolan Law Group, a Chicago firm so crass it has actually set up a  page  http://www.nolan-law.com/comm_disaster/commaviation12.html  on its Web site soliciting Sept. 11 clients. Mariani had previously been the subject of sympathetic profiles in the  Manchester (N.H.) Union Leader  http://www.theunionleader.com/articles_show.html?article=5429  and the  Daily Southtown  http://www.dailysouthtown.com/southtown/kadner/x30-pkd1.htm  of suburban Chicago. "I think Mrs. Mariani is using her battle for compensation as a form of therapy," Southtown columnist Phil Kadner wrote--before Mariani sued the airline.

Stupidity Watch

Some faculty members at California's  Orange Coast Community College  http://www.occ.cccd.edu/  are defending Muslim students who lied in an effort to get a professor fired,  The Weekly Standard  http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/000/713pprrb.asp  reports. As we  noted last week  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001603#hearlson , a tape of Kenneth Hearlson's class proved Hearlson was innocent of the charge of making bigoted remarks. Now the Standard reports that "24 instructors from departments ranging from English to Interior Design" have signed a petition saying: "We believe there is a strong possibility that Ken Hearlson exercised poor judgement [sic] in class, going beyond 'shock teaching' to create a hostile environment in class"--never mind that he's been proved innocent.  P. Kevin Parker  http://www.occ.cccd.edu/%7Ekparker/ , an English professor who signed the petition, tells the Standard: "The four students who raised complaints were !
fa!
ctually wrong in their accusations. However, they were inferentially correct."
 
That sound you hear is the world's smallest violin, playing for "commentator Guillermo Gomez Pena." According to  National Public Radio  http://www.npr.org/programs/atc/commentaries/2001/dec/ , he "had a series of nasty incidents at airports since Sept. 11. Besides looking Arab, his intense look as a performance artist makes him a candidate for profiling."

The  Washington Post  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A9569-2001Dec20.html  reports from Kandahar on Taliban hypocrisy and brutality. The dispatch begins with an amusing account from a mechanic, who was fixing a Talib big shot's Toyota pickup truck when he came upon "three tapes, by pop singers Nagham, Raub and Habib Sharif." The Taliban, of course, forbade music. More chillingly, residents of Kandahar had to lie to protect their own safety:

*** QUOTE ***

Zahir Jan, a Kandahar resident hanging around the headquarters of an anti-Taliban warlord today, still wore the black turban of the identity he sloughed off just a fortnight ago.

"I used to say, 'Yeah, I'm Taliban,' but the problem was I was scared," said Jan, when asked to explain the apparent ease of his transformation.

"Everybody was the same--scared. If you don't say you're Taliban, they would take me to the north," Jan said, referring to the Taliban's war against the opposition Northern Alliance. "You'll be on the front line. If you say you're Taliban, you stay in Kandahar with the family."

*** END QUOTE ***

Meanwhile, the  Torrance (Calif.) Daily Breeze  http://www.dailybreeze.com/content/bln/nmsburkha20.html  reports that five protesters showed up to a meeting of the Rancho Palos Verdes City Council clad in burkhas, to protest the council's Taliban-like behavior. So, is music against the law in this tony L.A. suburb? Are dissenters being rousted from their homes and sent into battle?

Well, no, not quite. The protesters were peeved because of "what they portrayed as a sexist decision not to elect the panel's only woman as deputy mayor."

Euro-Weenies  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A10054-2001Dec20.html

People from other parts of the world often ask: Why is America so arrogant? One reason surely is that the rest of the world is so silly. Especially Europe. In his Washington Post column, Robert Kagan reprints an excerpt of a discussion between leaders of European Union member countries debating the burning issue of whether the EU food-safety agency should be headquartered in Finland or Italy:

*** QUOTE ***

Silvio Berlusconi (Italian prime minister): "Parma is synonymous with good cuisine. The Finns don't even know what prosciutto is. I cannot accept this."

Wolfgang Schuessel (Austrian chancellor): "I'm not satisfied. We got nothing."

Goran Persson (Swedish prime minister): "This is no easy task. . . . But it's strange that the IT [information technology] agency should go to Spain."

Guy Verhofstadt (Belgian prime minister and acting EU president): "The gastronomic attraction of a region is no argument for the allocation of an EU agency."

Jacques Chirac (French president): "How would it be if Sweden got an agency for training models, since you have such pretty women?"

Berlusconi: ". . . My final answer is no!"

Gerhard Schroeder (German chancellor): "I love Parma, but you'll never get it if you argue like that."

Verhofstadt: "That's it."

*** END QUOTE ***

Kagan adds: "With that, Verhofstadt closed the meeting, for, as he later told reporters, "further negotiating . . . would have given a very negative image of what Europe is all about."

It Really Is a Permanent Campaign  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/21/politics/21CLIN.html

Bill Clinton is devoting his retirement to . . . improving the image of his presidency. The New York Times (link requires registration) reports:

*** QUOTE ***

Frustrated that his image has been battered since he left office, Mr. Clinton summoned several of his aides and advisers on Wednesday to devise ways to remind the public of his accomplishments and defend his legacy against criticism on matters including his role in the current recession and his failure to strike a fatal blow against Osama bin Laden or his terrorist network after the embassy bombings in East Africa in 1998.

Several participants at the meeting in Mr. Clinton's Harlem office said in interviews that they had agreed to compile a list of the Clinton administration's achievements that his supporters could have handy when defending the president. They hope to build a staff that will coordinate efforts to enlist former cabinet secretaries and other Clinton surrogates to appear on television talk shows and deliver speeches. And they are making plans to raise Mr. Clinton's profile on the lecture circuit, particularly before college audiences, which are most receptive.

*** END QUOTE ***

Some Clintonites, at least, have a little dignity. Erstwhile national security adviser Sandy Berger tells the Times: ""I feel very uncomfortable talking about these meetings."

Rush to Hear Again  http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_122001/content/statement.guest.html

Rush Limbaugh's "cochlear implant" operation was a success. "I feel great!" Limbaugh says in a press release. "The surgery went smoothly and I'm looking forward to enjoying the holidays and returning to the air in early January." Physician Antonio De la Cruz says Limbaugh should be able to hear within a few weeks. Our  John Fund  http://opinionjournal.com/diary/?id=95001300  described Limbaugh's affliction and treatment back in October, when it became public.

Homelessness Rediscovery Watch

*** QUOTE ***

"If George W. Bush becomes president, the armies of the homeless, hundreds of thousands strong, will once again be used to illustrate the opposition's arguments about welfare, the economy, and taxation."-- Mark Helprin  http://opinionjournal.com/columnists/mhelprin/?id=65000507 , Oct. 31, 2000

"Homelessness Has New Face: Working poor fill shelters as job market sags and housing prices surge"--headline and subheadline, Raleigh (N.C.)  News & Observer  http://www.newsobserver.com/friday/news/triangle/Story/846817p-832220c.html , Dec. 21, 2001

*** END QUOTE ***

Meanwhile,  Nick Coleman  http://www.pioneerplanet.com/news/mtc_docs/211271.htm  of the St. Paul Pioneer Press pens a sympathetic profile of a homeless pair, John Heitman and Amy Robson, who Coleman says are engaged to be married. The last paragraph begins: " 'I've got to behave out here,' Heitman says, explaining that he has cut down on his drinking, limiting himself to eight beers a day." The next time you're tempted to ignore the plight of the homeless, imagine how you'd feel if you had to survive on eight beers a day.

Plan a weekend to come down anytime.  We can take it to the cabin in the
land cut for the weekend.  The weather is perfect for it right now, plus
we can duck hunt and fish.

Anyway, have a good one and we'll talk to you later.

Transmission Customers:

Since FERC did not act on our September 11, 2001, PJM West compliance filing
(Docket No. RT01-98-000) at its December 19th meeting, Allegheny Power (AP)
will need to delay the start of the PJM West arrangement until March 1,
2002.  In order to accommodate the further delay in the start date, AP will
need to sell transmission service under the AP OATT and on the AP OASIS for
the month of February 2002.  To accomplish this, AP will do the following:

*	AP will attempt to call the Transmission Customers that have
"confirmed" point-to-point transmission service reservations on the PJM
OASIS for the paths that are not currently valid for PJM (AEP and DLCO) by
4:30 p.m. on December 21 to determine if they need comparable service on the
AP system.  If that is the case, AP will honor the "confirmed" reservations
and the PJM OASIS timestamps.
*	Yearly service that was not given the option to exercise roll-over
rights on the PJM paths (AP to PJM and PJM to AP) will be given the option
to extend that service through the month of February.  AP will attempt to
call these Transmission Customers by 4:30 p.m. on December 21.
*	ATCs for the month of February will be uploaded to the AP OASIS
starting at 8 a.m. on December 24.  The upload will include all valid AP
paths (AEP, PJM, VAP, FE and DLCO).
*	Transmission Marketing will post a message on the OASIS when the ATC
upload is started and when it is complete.
*	Transmission service beyond March 1, 2002, will continue to be sold
by PJM per the Interim Coordination Agreement that was filed with FERC on
February 12, 2001.
*	January 30, 2002, is the last scheduled FERC meeting in January.
If FERC does not act on our filing at that time, the start of the PJM West
arrangement may then be delayed until April 1, 2002.  Further information
will be provided at that time, if necessary.


AP regrets any inconvenience that this delay may have caused you.  AP will
continue to keep you up-to-date on the implementation of PJM West.  AP has
requested that FERC issue an effective date of the first day of the calendar
month which begins at least thirty days after the date on which FERC issues
an order.  If you have any additional questions or concerns, please call me
at (724) 838-6748 or the Transmission Marketers at (724) 838-6064.

Hi Desk,

I need to swap off the last 2 days of this yr a.k.a the 30th and the 31st of dec cos I already have a ski trip planned over the end of the yr starting post christmas. I am working days on the aforementioned dates (thank god for small mercies..so no one has to disrupt their new-yr nite plans) so with all the holiday pay and a chance to take off any 2 days from now till then and have me fill em in for u..should i hope entice someone at least.

Here's to waiting for your +ve replies.

Cheers,


Punit.

Genco 1-877-294-3900
Services 1-800-611-1282

How will the cutover work.  If a trader, operator logins in at the new building will the 800 numbers not follow.  If so then we will bring in an extra crew at noon to login and get set up in the new building with a planned cut over around 3pm.  Once the transfer is done you will relocate the mapp equipment as well as the remaining ercot, midwest, southeast and northeast equipment to the new building.

The night shift will report to the new building at 6pm.

Thanks.

How many 1-800 phone numbers does power have? ( If any other than 24 Hr trading, please advise)
What is the number for 24 HR group? ( I will need to coordinate a cutover for this)
Do you know of any special phone needs for the weekend trading?  (The people on turrets will be fine, they pin in anywhere)

ENSE, MDEA and East Power was $5425 for last month.  I'm trying to reduce the number of users and services that we don't require.  In the end the cost should be significantly less than this number.

The west has their own arrangements with OATI.  

You will not require anything for the change over to etag 1.7 in march as OATI will take care of this as part of their services.

Kevin Burns from OATI will be in Houston on Feb 13th from 1-3 to discuss UBS services required and I would recommend that you have some one sit down and review the services that you will need going foreward.

Hope this helps. 

For passwords you can contact Don for MDEA & EPMIEA and Eric has the Genco ones.

Thanks.

Lloyd,

Paul and I are meeting with Bob Hall tomorrow morning to sort out what resources we need.  What is the cost per account for these and do these include Portland requirements as well?  Also, what do we need to do for the changeover to the new scheduling system in March?  

Tom.

Corry, Don, Theresa and Tom.

I have asked OATI to reduce the number of accounts from 40 to 10 to reduce the costs for the estate.  Therefore I recommend we go down to the following accounts Enron01-10.

Please reply ASAP.

Thanks

Lloyd,
I am going to attach a document that contains the 40 users for EPMIE.
Please let me know which 30 users you would like me to delete, and I will
take care of that for you.  I will also let my billing department know to
change all of the contact information on your invoices to what you have
stated below.  Do you know if these are going to be the Entity names that
you will be using for UBS AG or will they be different.  Just let me know.
If you could let me know which users you would like deleted, I will get this
taken care of for you. [May, Tom]

Subject: Isn't  it Funny
Do you  think YOU will pass it on??? 
  
  
One day Satan and  Jesus were having a conversation. Satan had just come from the Garden  of Eden, and he was gloating and boasting. "Yes, sir, I just caught  the world full of people down there. Set me a trap, used bait I knew  they couldn't resist. Got 'em all!" 
"What are you going to do with  them?" Jesus asked. 
Satan replied, "Oh, I'm gonna have fun!  I'm gonna teach them how to marry and divorce each other, how to hate  and abuse each other, how to drink and smoke and curse. I'm gonna  teach them how to invent guns and bombs and kill each other. I'm  really gonna have fun!" 
"And what will you do when you get done  with them?" Jesus asked. 
"Oh, I'll kill 'em," Satan glared proudly.  
"How much do you want for them?" Jesus asked. 
"Oh, you don't  want those people. They ain't no good. Why, you'll take them and  they'll just hate you. They'll spit on you, curse you and  kill you!! You don't want those people!!" 
"How much?" He asked  again. 
Satan looked at Jesus and sneered, "All your tears, and all  your blood." 
Jesus said, "DONE!"   Then He paid the price.  
  
Isn't it funny how simple it is for people to trash God  and then wonder why the world's going to hell.  
Isn't it funny  how we believe what the newspapers say, but question what the Bible  says.  
Isn't it funny how everyone wants to go to heaven  provided they do not have to believe, think, say, or do anything  the Bible says. Or is it scary? 
Isn't it funny how someone can  say "I believe in God" but still follow Satan (who, by the way, also  "believes" in God). 
Isn't it funny how you can send a  thousand jokes through e-mail and they spread like wildfire, but when  you start sending messages regarding the Lord, people think twice  about sharing. 
Isn't it funny how the lewd, crude, vulgar  and obscene pass freely through cyberspace, but the public  discussion of Jesus is suppressed in the school and  workplace. >  Isn't it funny how someone can be so fired  up for Christ on Sunday, but be an invisible Christian the rest of the  week. 
Are you laughing? 
Isn't it funny how when you go to  forward this message, you will not send it to many on your  address list because you're not sure what they believe, or what they  will think of you for sending it to them. 
Isn't it funny how I can  be more worried about what other people think of me than what God  thinks of me. 
  
 Will YOU pass this on?  
 I did.

Hey Deskmates,

Before I toodle off to Denver and my bones grace a few ski slopes I figured I would tell you guys what Eric Serio told me when I was doing the first MDEA nightly checkout thingie. 

I was given to understand that the whole idea behind these EES nitely checkouts for MDEA was that the Services application as well as OATI/scheduling/Daily checkout to agree. However after a couple of conversations with Mike we both reached the inescapable conclusion that not all of us are on the same page as far as MDEA checkouts go. This I hope will help rid of that problem.

My understanding is as follows: 
1. OATI's 'Actual MW' and Services 'Actual Net Tie' have to agree. 
2. OATI's 'Inadvertent' row under daily checkout and Services' "Imbalance' especially have to agree.
3. The above 2 would automatically agree if OATI is functioning properly and picks up MW numbers from the tags (which however has not been the case in the past 4 days)
4. Once the MDEA fax arrives and is synchronized with Services, hit "Edit Actual-MW values" in OATI : Daily checkout under shceduling. Put in the same values as the MDEA fax (system load) and the synchronized Services' " Actual Net Tie" (which should by now agree with System Load of the MDEA fax). 
5. Hit "Apply". Now OATI and Services should agree on "Actual-MW values" and "Actual Net Tie". They should also agree on "Inadvertent" and "Imbalance" respectively. (If not, Eric told me there was a procedure by where one could build a dummy tag just to make OATI agree (apparently they have had this problem before , since they have a solution for it) but assured me that we would not need to worry about that).
6. After this go through the normal procedure explained in the night desk duties email. 

This is only my understanding of it and might be completely flawed. However I think there might be some merit to it since we fax over the Net Tie report and the printouts of our OATI(scheduled and next day) to EES. The reason being that they can check on their OATI and see if they agree or not. (I also assume that they do not have a similar Services application as ours since that would obviate the need for OATI checkouts). Which, again is why it is so imperative that our Services and OATI agree. 

Lastly, in case I am horribly wrong on the above and someone decides to take it up to instruct me for the better, I shall be available at 303-693-1965 for the remainder of my holiday and on 720-320-4270 for 24/7.

Happy New Year to all of you and your families. May the new year bring more certainty and better fortune for all of us.

Adios, for now,

Punit.

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 4  boxes per person.  

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRIDAY, 11/16/01.

Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with the move.

T.Jae, Lisa, Claudia & Lloyd

Lloyd,

Paul and I are meeting with Bob Hall tomorrow morning to sort out what resources we need.  What is the cost per account for these and do these include Portland requirements as well?  Also, what do we need to do for the changeover to the new scheduling system in March?  

Tom.

Corry, Don, Theresa and Tom.

I have asked OATI to reduce the number of accounts from 40 to 10 to reduce the costs for the estate.  Therefore I recommend we go down to the following accounts Enron01-10.

Please reply ASAP.

Thanks

Lloyd,
I am going to attach a document that contains the 40 users for EPMIE.
Please let me know which 30 users you would like me to delete, and I will
take care of that for you.  I will also let my billing department know to
change all of the contact information on your invoices to what you have
stated below.  Do you know if these are going to be the Entity names that
you will be using for UBS AG or will they be different.  Just let me know.
If you could let me know which users you would like deleted, I will get this
taken care of for you. [May, Tom]

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

Dave Forster

David, could you let me know who on your team has the right skillset to par=
ticipate in a conference call Monday morning to discuss phase in of MISO op=
erations.  I suspect that it is the person who primarily arranges transacti=
ons through OASIS and/or schedules.  As discussed on Monday afternoon this =
is the chance to ensure that our operational people are on top of the trans=

Mike,

MISO announced at the Policy Subcommittee meeting yesterday that it would b=
e phasing in Day One operations pursuant to the proposal outlined below.  C=
ommercial operations would commence on the basis of MISO's ISO (rather than=
 RTO) status, although MISO anticipates that FERC will designate it an RTO =
on December 19 (this anticipation on the basis of discussions between Jim T=
orgenson and FERC at the NARUC meetings last week).  MISO foresees many que=
stions regarding implementation of the phasein, and is requesting that a wo=
rking group representing all sectors be established to work with the transm=
ission owners to accomplish the phase-in.  A conference call will be held o=
n Monday November 19 to put together the working group and organize its act=
ivities (call in number not yet distributed).  It was clear from yesterday'=
s meeting that the first efforts of the working group will be to work throu=
gh implementation issues for the December 15 actiivities; subsequent effort=
s will be dedicated to January 1 and February 1 implementation.  The outcom=
e of the working group's December 15 implementation recommendations will be=
 presented to an interim meeting of the Advisory Committee on December 5.

ENDGAME IN AFGHANISTAN?

American planes kept up their attacks on the remaining TALIBAN
STRONGHOLD of Kandahar, while Kunduz seemed on the brink of surrender.
The Northern Alliance, King Mohammed Zahir Shah and Pakistan-based
Pushtuns agreed to send representatives to a UN-brokered meeting near
Bonn to discuss the structure of a transitional post-Taliban government.

- - - - - See article: Distantly, the shape of peace
http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34858_6659418_1_79944192_60299072_1_6f

Twenty-one countries met in Washington to start to plan the ECONOMIC
RECONSTRUCTION of Afghanistan. The UN said that rebuilding the country
would cost more than $25 billion over 10 years.

President George Bush, addressing troops in Kentucky, gave warnings
that the "most difficult steps" lay ahead: the breaking of al-Qaeda and
the capture of Osama bin Laden. The bounty for his capture was raised
to $25m.

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34857_6659418_1_79944192_60299072_1_6e

THE SAFEST WAY TO TRAVEL

President George Bush signed a long-awaited AVIATION-SECURITY bill. As
many as 28,000 of the people who screen air passengers and their
baggage will become federal employees. The bill also calls for stronger
cockpit doors on aircraft and more armed federal marshals on flights.

An elderly woman in Connecticut died from the inhalation form of
ANTHRAX. A letter to Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont tested positive
for the disease: so did the offices of two more senators.

- - - - - See article: Curiouser and curiouser
http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34856_6659418_1_79944192_60299072_1_6d

The United States denounced Iraq, North Korea, Iran, Libya, Syria and
Sudan for having, or seeking to acquire, BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS. The move
accompanied proposals by the Bush administration to strengthen the 1972
Biological Weapons Convention.

RASMUSSEN BEATS RASMUSSEN

DENMARK'S centre-right Liberals, led by Anders Fogh Rasmussen, won a
general election, beating the centre-left Social Democrats, led by Poul
Nyrup Rasmussen, the European Union's longest-serving prime minister.

- - - - - See article: Anders Fogh Rasmussen
http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34862_6659418_1_79944192_60299072_1_6a

The government of GERMANY'S chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, narrowly won
a parliamentary vote of confidence tied to his promise to send troops
abroad to help in the war against terrorism, but many of his
coalition's Greens, who have a party congress this weekend, continue to
wobble.

- - - - - See article: Still edgy
http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34861_6659418_1_79944192_60299072_1_69

Mr Schroder's chief foreign-policy adviser, MICHAEL STEINER, resigned
after losing his temper with a German sergeant who is said to have
failed to get him some caviare during a refuelling stopover.

An ex-Communist, Georgi Purvanov, was elected president of BULGARIA,
against the wishes of the country's prime minister, Simeon Saxe-Coburg,
its ex-king.

- - - - - See article: Up to a point, King Simeon
http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34860_6659418_1_79944192_60299072_1_68

In KOSOVO the more moderate ethnic-Albanian nationalists led by Ibrahim
Rugova, who is expected to become the province's president, won a
general election.

After weeks of hesitation, MACEDONIA'S parliament endorsed
constitutional amendments to give the country's ethnic-Albanian
minority more rights.

MIDDLE EAST PEACE EFFORT

Colin Powell, America's secretary of state, heralded a fresh American
effort to end ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN VIOLENCE. Anthony Zinni, a former
commander of American forces in the Middle East, was instructed to help
negotiate a ceasefire, and to remain in the region until his mission
was accomplished.

- - - - - See article: When an irresistable Zinni meets an immovable
Sharon
http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34859_6659418_1_79944192_60299072_1_70

Ninety-four suspected ISLAMIC MILITANTS went on trial before an
Egyptian military court. All were charged with belonging to a secret
organisation working against the state; the relatives of some say they
were tortured to obtain confessions.

Five GAZAN CHILDREN were killed by an unexploded Israeli tank shell on
their way to school.

Morgan Tsvangirai, Zimbabwe's opposition leader, was cleared of treason
charges, and so will run against ROBERT MUGABE in next year's
presidential election. Mr Mugabe, in his campaign against white
farmers, threatened to break up farms larger than 2,000 hectares (4,940
acres).

Daniel arap Moi, Kenya's president, strengthened his standing in the
country by appointing Uhuru Kenyatta, son of Kenya's first president
and independence hero, Joseph Kenyatta, to be a local government
minister.

SYRIA released a handful of political prisoners, some detained since
the mid-1980s, as part of a presidential amnesty. But human-rights
groups estimate that some 1,300 political dissidents are still
detained.

An official report into a $5 billion arms deal in SOUTH AFRICA found no
evidence of widespread corruption, but identified conflicts of interest
and murky goings-on.

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34866_6659418_1_79944192_60299072_1_6e

MISS NIGERIA became the first black African to win the Miss World
beauty contest.

ARGENTINA MUDDLES ON

More trouble for ARGENTINA'S government, as it struggles to persuade
investors to accept a restructuring of its debt. Domingo Cavallo, the
economy minister, admitted that falling tax revenues meant fiscal
targets agreed with the IMF would be missed. Meanwhile, the Supreme
Court quashed charges of arms smuggling against Carlos Menem, a former
president.

A group representing VENEZUELA'S private sector called a one-day
"strike" in protest at 49 decree-laws issued by President Hugo Chavez,
which include measures to increase royalties on oil production and
limit land ownership.

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34865_6659418_1_79944192_60299072_1_6d

In a historic chink in a trade embargo imposed in 1960, three American
firms signed contracts to sell foodstuffs worth about $20m to CUBA.

SPIRITUAL SUPPORT

A group of 35 westerners unfurled a banner in Beijing in support of the
FALUN GONG, a spiritual movement banned in China. The demonstrators,
who came from the United States and Europe, had entered China on
tourist visas. All were deported.

China closed 17,500 INTERNET CAFES, claiming that too many people were
becoming hooked on computer games and pornographic sites. Another
28,000 Internet cafes are to be closely monitored.

The KING OF MALAYSIA, Sultan Salahuddin, died aged 75, leaving 14
children from four marriages. His successor will be chosen from one of
nine traditional rulers who take it in turns to be king.

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

Subject:	Implementing PJM WEST

As we have discussed on our conference calls, AP will be joining PJM WEST on
January 1, 2002.  The formation of PJM WEST will result in two Control Areas
being operated as a single market under the PJM umbrella.  As such, PJM will
become the Security Coordinator and Transmission Provider for AP.  Additionally,
AP will no longer be a valid source or sink; PJM will be the source/sink.

In order to avoid potential validation errors with the Book of Flowgate, the
following implementation strategy is proposed to transition the Book of
Flowgates and the IDC base case from their present configuration to the
configuration required for PJM WEST.


Before January 1, 2002:

Step 1)  In the Book of Flowgates, add "PJM" as a Control Area, Security
Coordinator and Transmission Provider to all flowgates that presently have "AP"
listed as a Control Area.

Beginning 1/1/02, PJM will be the Security Coordinator for AP.  For system
reliability it will be necessary for PJM to have the ability to call TLRs on AP
flowgates.  Adding "PJM" to these flowgates provides for a smooth transition
across the changeover period of late December and early January.  This should
not cause OATI validation problems as both 'AP' and 'PJM' are entities
registered control areas


On January 1, 2002:

Tags with 'AP' as either the Source or Sink will be denied; PJM is now the valid
source/sink.


After January 1, 2002:

Step 2)  In the Book of Flowgates, remove AP flowgates from ECAR area and add
them into MAAC area.  Flowgates get new MAAC region numbers.


Step 3)  In the Book of Flowgates, remove "AP" as a Control Area, Security
Coordinator and Transmission Provider to all flowgates where PJM was added as
such in Step 1.


Step 4)  In the IDC base case, move the 'AP' area into the 'PJM' area.


Step 5)  In the NERC Registry, remove "AP" as a Control Area, Security
Coordinator and Transmission Provider.

Thought this one was worth forwarding...Hope all is well...Tre 
This was on the editorial page on Sunday, October 28, 2001 of the Denton 
Record Chronicle (by Dwight Crawford Sr., Sanger, Tx) 
The Immunity of Texas 
I get a big laugh at the dialogue of Osama bin Laden, the Taliban, 
politicians, and the news media. They say terrorists will hit us again in 
the oncoming weeks and months. What a joke! You have a better chance of 
getting killed on Interstate 35 E than by a terrorist. 
Osama has probably seen 100 degree plus summers in Afghanistan, but he 
doesn't have fire ants to go with it. If he did he wouldn't be sleeping on 
the ground in his cave. He talks of pain and suffering he is going to 
inflict on us. He doesn't know what pain is, until he gets kicked by a green 
broke, two-year-old colt in freezing rain. Germ war fare? Texas ticks will 
give you Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and Lyme disease, Blister Beetles kill 
your horse, Green Bugs destroy a wheat crop, and termites eat your house. 
Anthrax has killed Texas cattle for over 125 years. So, what's new? 
Our prairie dogs carry the plague, armadillos harbor leprosy, and our bats 
and skunks threaten rabies. We have rattlesnakes, copperheads, and water 
moccasins. Ho hum. 
They talk of gas and biological warfare. They have never pulled in behind a 
cattle truck while its raining, or ridden in the front seat of a pickup 
between two cowboys, after they just eaten a big bowl of Texas Red. 
Texas ain't for sissies! We have posted signs all over the state that says, 
"Don't mess with Texas!" Osama, consider yourself warned!

Dear Investor,

About 3 weeks ago, I e-mailed you about a stock I
believe can make you filthy rich.

So far, I haven't heard back from you, and that's a
real shame.  That's because we don't get many chances
like this one -- where a small investment now can
create true wealth in just a couple short years.

Think I'm kidding?  This company just issued a small
piece of good news yesterday, and its stock POPPED
27%.  Now today, it's up another 12% at mid-day.
That's 39% GAINS in 9 1/2 trading hours!  When's the
last time you made profits like that?

Best of all, those gains are just the appetizer for
the feast to follow.  So it's not too late for you --
if you get in now.  So what's the story?  And why is
it so powerful?

Well, my friend, this company's revolutionary
communications breakthrough makes Federal Express look
like the Pony Express...and could well make you 500%
RICHER by 2003.

I'm talking of a global network to deliver documents,
data, video on-demand -- anything you can imagine --
anywhere in the world...at the SPEED OF LIGHT!  Yet the
company behind this remarkable achievement -- a GEM
rich in innovation and cash -- is priced at giveaway
prices thanks to the market meltdown.

This ISN'T some punk Internet stock struggling to stay
afloat.  The company has a $2.4 BILLION cash war chest
and a list of PAYING CLIENTS that reads like the
"who's who" of global communications.  I've been
professionally involved in global stock markets for 30
years now, and I can honestly say I've seldom seen a
story so dramatic.

*At my California Technology Stock Letter, we jumped
on Intel in 1994, when most analysts scoffed at its
prospects.  Three years later, we sold for 575% GAINS.

*In July 1998, Power Integrations got knocked down to
silly levels, so I practically screamed at clients to,
"BUY!"  We better than tripled our money in less than
six months' time.

*DUSA Pharmaceuticals was going begging in 1998 when
we gobbled up all we could.  Our 1,316% gains turned
$25,000 into more than $350,000.

THERE ARE MORE LIKE THESE.  But they don't come around
every day.  That's why I'm pounding the table on this
one.  I'm expecting some of the EASIEST PROFITS we've
ever made.  And if you MISS OUT, you'll kick yourself
later.

I've just put the finishing touches on an URGENT
Profit Bulletin called You Can Be 500% Richer By 2003
that I'd like you to have.  It details the saga of the
#1 TOP-DOG in global communications today...explains why
this company will dominate worldwide while others
fail...and gives you hard evidence for 500% PROFITS by
2003.

And that's just to start.  There's a great shot at
TENFOLD GAINS in the next 5 years, because this
company truly controls the destiny of global
communications.

THE FUTURE OF COMMUNICATIONS IS FIBER OPTICS.  Think
of nearly unlimited bandwidth at incredibly efficient
prices.  Experience and research tells me, this is an
industry destined for greatness.    Ask yourself this:
Will we go back to rotary phones, no Internet and
scratchy long-distance calls?  Or will we go forward
to faster connections... Internet use throughout the
world...and a wide array of data, video, conferencing,
etc, services?

My friend, man simply DOESN'T go backwards.  It's
human nature to want what your neighbor has.  It's
human nature to want bigger, better and more.  That's
why I believe the communications revolution isn't
over...it's JUST GETTING STARTED.  There will be bumps,
bruises and shakeouts along the way.  But that just
allows KINGPIN companies like this one to gobble up
even more market share.

THIS COMPANY INVESTED more than $7 billion to link 27
companies with a revolutionary 100,000-mile fiber
optic network.  And in a real twist in today's world,
the project just finished on budget...on schedule.
What's more, this network isn't some empty shell -- it
has real paying customers, with contracts covering
half the cost already.

*Its customers already include major telecoms like
Deutsche Telekom, British Telecom and Qwest;
institutions like the British government and the U.S.
Navy; and companies like Proctor & Gamble, American
Express, Direct TV and JP Morgan Chase.  And the
company has already inked $1 billion worth of new
deals so far this year.

*China is becoming a huge source of profits.  The
country has pledged to spend $13 billion to improve
its infrastructure in preparation for the 2008
Olympics -- much of that for communications upgrades.
What's more, China's entry into the World Trade
Organization will trigger another spending spree.  And
this company will be one of the prime beneficiaries.
As you'll see in your free report, the China
connection is HUGE!

*This company has been on an earnings tear, prior to
the hit our entire economy  has taken this fall.
EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes, depreciation
and amortization) rose 33% in the 2nd quarter -- a
phenomenal number.  And as the economy recovers, I
expect EBITDA to return to its blistering growth pace.

*What's more, this company is set to be a big player
in Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) that enable SECURE
communications between groups of people anywhere in
the world.  Virtual "face-to-face" audio and video.
No need for airline travel.  Analysts expect this
industry to grow quickly and become huge.

THERE WILL BE WINNERS AND LOSERS in the bandwidth
game.  And I'll bet dollars to doughnuts, this company
will be the BIGGEST WINNER of all.   In today's weak
economy, the smaller outfits are teetering on the
edge.  They can't raise capital.  But in the meantime,
this JUGGERNAUT is sitting on $2.4 BILLION in cash!

I sense AMAZING OPPORTUNITY here.  But the opportunity
won't last long.  Today's confusion about the economy
has some real gems priced like baubles.  And this
stock is a GLITTERING DIAMOND just waiting for you to
scoop it up.

Richer By 2003.  To find out how, please GO HERE:

Editor, California Technology Stock Letter

P.S.  Bill Gates is one smart guy -- and Microsoft
recently inked a new deal with this company to link
all its European offices.  Why?  Because it's the only
place to turn for state-of-the-art technology and
service.  You must understand, no other firm can match
this company's technologies or global reach.  And I
don't believe we'll ever see this stock priced so low
again -- even after its 27% GAINS today.  Grab YOUR
SHARE of the profits ahead.  Click here now:

Dave:  As far a new numbers for the Portland folks, I believe that once we split from the PGE phone system you will need acquire new numbers from Qwest.  This question was posed to Ruth quite some time ago, and the direction at that time was that the numbers belong to PGE and we were going to get new numbers.  We had some numbers reserved with Linda Rowlett at Qwest, but I don't know if they are still available.  Give me a call and we can discuss.  Thanks!!

Kathy

I am waiting for direction based on his efforts.

Just to be clear, there is no final decision yet on if UBS PDX will do the contracted back work (in part in in whole) for West Power Estate.  Until a decision is made, please do not make any changes to the current numbers in Portland.

Re: New Numbers for UBS Trading, Realtime, and Scheduling.  I am looking for advice on what needs to happen.  Kathy, please let me know what question I should be asking of local business if any, or if this just needs to happen.

Subject:	New UBS Phone Number Requests


Several discussions have been circulating regarding current Enron phone numbers and the need for new toll-free numbers the UBS East Power Group.

For the UBS Power Trading group (EAST):

  We can request new toll-free numbers (24 Hour, Fax and Scheduling) as per Kathy Link (UBS Houston 5-5418).  
	a. 	Don Baughman and I have discussed a few options for these numbers, but would welcome any input or related requirements you may be 				aware of prior to us initiating this.
	b.	We will establish these for East Power ASAP.   David Steiner (503-464-3701) will be the contact to facilitate this effort for the West Desk
   	

   Our current "853" numbers will probably be replaced by new "584" numbers(Kathy Link is working on this).  If this occurs, new numbers will be assigned to us.

   Our Current "800" numbers for 24-Hour, "Fax, and Scheduling can be forwarded  / transferred by the IT group to the Estate from our current phone turrets.

Let's discuss these numbers tomorrow, Tuesday morning (February 4th).

Thanks,

Corry Bentley

David, as per emails last week this will be Enrons only chance to participate and provide feedback to MISO as it starts up operations.  Kerry was on the call this morning and while Enron may be able to add a member to this group it will be difficult.  If you are interested coordinate with Kerry...

Subject:	info on MISO startup conference call

Mike, here's some addtional information about the working group that was put together on this morning's conference call to work through implementation issues associated with MISO's commercial start-up.  Earlier this morning I emailed an agenda for the call and a revised commercial operation start-up plan.  

The purpose of the call was to establish a small working group to identify and resolve, from a market perspective,  the issues associated with MISO's proposed start-up plan.  The working group will be working closely with transmission owner reps who are looking at start-up implementation from a systems perspective.  The working group will have a conference call on November 26 (the purpose of the call is to identify all of the implementation issues) , and working sessions on 12/3 and 12/4 prior to a presentation to an interim meeting of the MISO Advisory Committee on issues associated with 12/15 implementation plans.  The group will meet thereafter, at times yet unspecified, to deal with implementation issues associated with 1/1 and 2/1 implementation (including for example MISO tariff administration begining 1/1 for point-to-point and possibly existing network service and beginning 2/1 for new network service requests).

Persons/entities named to the working group this morning included Richard Doying, PGE; Jim Stanton, Calpine; someone from WPPI; Bill Jett, Cinergy Trading; Greg ____ from Dynegy; Rob Martin from Wisconsin Electric; Jim Bradkowski, DTE; and Malcolm Burgess, ATC.  If someone from Enron wishes to be added, they should talk to John Caitlin of the MISO staff ASAP.  John Caitlin is also accepting emails identifying implementation issues associated with the commercial operation plan that need to be resolved.

It appears that our vandals were just in the area and happened to be
attracted by the lights.  In my haste to get the email out and go ride the
neighborhood, I said Rampart and I meant Royal.  The young gentlemen were
seen walking and thanks to the quick action of several people, they were
talked to by A big thank you to LCPD again for their support and patrols .
No one could prove that it was those young men, but there was reasonable
suspicion.  Royal looks great and was just the invitation someone needed to
enter the neighborhood and get mischievous.  Obviously, they have not concept
of the time and efforts that go into the decorating of the wonderful yards.
If you have not been out to drive the neighborhood, please do.  The traffic
was incredible.  The village looks great.  Thank you all for your efforts.

Also, I have been told that the tree cutters are not totally responsible
about the closing of gates and dogs are being let out.  If you gave
permission for that company to be in your yard, please contact them if you
have a problem.  Also, let me know if you pet was let out.  Once again, watch
out for your neighbors and their pets.  If you see a stray that you
recognize, be a good neighbor and corral the critter.

Have a safe and happy holiday.
Mary G. Strickland

All of the light bulbs were taken out of the arches on Rampart this evening.
Other arches have missing bulbs.  Please keep your eyes open and report
vandalism to the League City Police Department.  Believe me, I know that the
police have other things to do, but these young people will be into other
things when there are not bulbs to take.  This evening three young gentlemen
were seen and the police were called. .  The police will be patrolling and
your neighbors are out watching also.  The neighborhood looks wonderful and,
if you have not driven other areas, CCV is by far the best in this area.
Please let emial me or call Rusty or other board memebers when you have a
problem.  The board is doing a great job of staying on top of things.  Have a
happy holiday and stay safe.  Mary G. Strickland

This week a little hectic for me, but could maybe do Wed. / Thurs. night.   I'll be out of town this weekend.  I was wondering if you fell into Mardi Gras after I didn't hear from you last Friday night ... :)    Call me later.

Hola senorita,  
What's goin on with you? Just trying to get this business cranked up! Yeah  
I've been busier that an one legged man in an ass kickin' contest! The  
weekend was great, I'm pretty sure that I'll join the Krewe of Gambrinus,  
after Mardi Gras. What have you been up to? How was your weekend? What's  
goin' on this week. Find a night when I can cook you supper and have some  
beer & cider. I've got my sister's birthday party at Mom & Dad's tonight,  
but open the rest of the week. Drop me a line when you have a chance.  
Take care,  
DB

Here's Ollie's response to this e-mail that's going

Dale,

I checked the following directories you requested in our meeting today.  See my notes below:

M:\Electric\Genco			All of the Genco files must stay with the estate
M:\Electric\NERC Reports		Rika Imai will move over to UBS
M:\Electric\Transmission		Rika Imai will move over to UBS
M:\eServices\Genco			All of the Genco files must stay with the estate
M:\Electric\MidMarket\Transmission Info 
M:\Electric\MidMarket\Transmission Studies	

The two tranmission folders in the MidMarkets directory are not ours.  We will not need them however, you may want to take a quick look to see if your organization will need the information.  

Please let me know if you need me to check others for you.  

Thanks.

We will need to be packed and ready to move for WEDNESDAY, 02/06/02 & THURSDAY, 02/07/02.  The move team will be moving our group during the day and the stenos will NOT be working until Monday, 02/11/02.


Also, please make sure that we LOGOFF again tonight...the IT group could not migrate us over the weekend due to incomplete items with legal.  They are going to try and take care of the migration tonight for the new UBS systems.

Re: PDX Estate 800 numbers for Real Time and Scheduling.  I have spoken with Murray Oneil, who is working on the estate efforts in PDX and facilitating whatever decisions are made on where the resources will be homed for Estate, West Power functions.  I am waiting for direction based on his efforts.

Just to be clear, there is no final decision yet on if UBS PDX will do the contracted back work (in part in in whole) for West Power Estate.  Until a decision is made, please do not make any changes to the current numbers in Portland.

Re: New Numbers for UBS Trading, Realtime, and Scheduling.  I am looking for advice on what needs to happen.  Kathy, please let me know what question I should be asking of local business if any, or if this just needs to happen.

I will be the on site contact and can be reached at 503.464.3701 desk,,, or 503.703.1553 cell.

Thanks

Dave

Several discussions have been circulating regarding current Enron phone numbers and the need for new toll-free numbers the UBS East Power Group.

For the UBS Power Trading group (EAST):

  We can request new toll-free numbers (24 Hour, Fax and Scheduling) as per Kathy Link (UBS Houston 5-5418).  
	a. 	Don Baughman and I have discussed a few options for these numbers, but would welcome any input or related requirements you may be 				aware of prior to us initiating this.
	b.	We will establish these for East Power ASAP.   David Steiner (503-464-3701) will be the contact to facilitate this effort for the West Desk
   	

   Our current "853" numbers will probably be replaced by new "584" numbers(Kathy Link is working on this).  If this occurs, new numbers will be assigned to us.

   Our Current "800" numbers for 24-Hour, "Fax, and Scheduling can be forwarded  / transferred by the IT group to the Estate from our current phone turrets.

Let's discuss these numbers tomorrow, Tuesday morning (February 4th).

Thanks,

Corry Bentley

Dear InvestorPlace.com Member,

I've just revealed a BRAND-NEW wireless recommendation
to my subscribers, and I'm SO excited about this
opportunity that I want to share the details with you,
too.

You see, wireless growth is simply exploding around
the world -- especially after the September 11
terrorist attacks.  Cell phone giant Nokia, for
example, has skyrocketed 41% just since October
1st...worldwide wireless traffic is projected to grow a
whopping 30% in 2001 alone...China plans to spend $151
BILLION on its telecom infrastructure by 2005...and
that's just the very BEGINNING of what lies ahead for
this monstrous market!

Quite simply, the profit potential is huge, and I want
to make sure that my subscribers -- and now you -- get
a piece of the phenomenal gains ahead.  That's why I'm
so excited about my newest recommendation.  I expect
it to leap 50% in the next 12 months ALONE, and I'm
looking for more incredible gains after that.  Let me
show you why.

First, you might not even know about this, but there
has been an INTENSE tech competition over the last
couple of years for the new digital wireless standard.
That battle is now over -- and this company has WON!
That means their proprietary technology will be used
in most 2.5G cell phones (set to be deployed early in
2002), and in practically ALL of the next generation
3G phones.  That alone is a terrific boon for this
stock...but keep reading, because this opportunity gets
EVEN BETTER.

Not only does this company get paid for every one of
its chips used in 2.5G or 3G cell phones...but it also
gets paid a license fee from every single company that
wants to sell or market a cell phone based on its
winning technology.  And I'm not talking about a
simple one-time fee either-these royalties get paid on
a QUARTERLY BASIS, for as long as the technology is
used.  One day, thanks to the strength of their
technology, I fully expect this company to get paid
for EVERY single cell phone in use!

And with projections for 1.3 billion cell phone
subscribers by 2003 and continued steady growth in the
following years, this is an absolutely EXPLOSIVE
opportunity for my stock.  This is a $42 billion
company growing an incredible 27% per year and
spending an impressive 17% of revenues on research and
development -- EXACTLY the type of commitment to
future growth that makes me so confident they will
maintain their competitive edge and DOMINATE their
market space for years to come.

I can almost guarantee that you'll be kicking yourself
for years to come if you don't buy this stock now.
DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN TO YOU!  I revealed the name of
this company -- including my buy price, target price
and full profit details -- in the December issue of
Technology Investing, which just got released.

To make sure that you're on board for ALL the profits
we expect to make with this wireless dominator, all
you have to do is accept a RISK-FREE trial to
Technology Investing today.  (Just visit
http://www.ppi-orders.com/index.htm?promo_code=0VN167
to do so now.)  When you do, you'll get the December
issue of Technology Investing immediately, and I'll send
you up to 4 FREE bonus reports with all of the details on
my other tech and biotech recommendations.  Plus, your
subscription will be fully covered by my 100% MONEY-
BACK GUARANTEE.  That means if you're not completely
satisfied within the first 6 months, I'll refund every
single penny you've paid.  No questions asked.

Don't miss out on this monster profit opportunity!
Join Technology Investing today, and buy this hot
stock tomorrow for 50% gains in the next 12 months.

Sincerely,

Michael Murphy

When: Thursday, November 01, 2001 9:00 AM-2:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
Where: EB3127 for Nov. 1st from  9:00 am - 2:00 pm

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*



AGENDA:
9:00A  to 11:00A
Kevin Burns will be here from OATI to provide specifications and describe in more detail the functionality of Web Trader.  
11:30 to 2:00 PM 
Our goal is to have representatives from the 24-Hour Group and the IT Group bring specific questions for Kevin.   
Let's determine if WebTrader can be flexible enough to replace the P&L (Delphi) application, interact with Enpower, and provide a good detailed database for historical information.  Most importantly, is this application fast and efficient enough to add value to the 24-hour group.

Call me with any questions or to discuss.  853-0421

Thanks,

Corry

Hello all,

Attached is an updated sheet regarding what needs to be done at night regarding MDEA and our old nightly duties. 

Also there is now a folder near the MAPP printer (between Dean and Don) that will include all the nightly faxes and load sheets.  The folder will help us keep track of what has been faxed in case EES trans calls complaining.  The load sheets are needed for the daily forecasting expained in the SOP 13 Dean sent out last week. In the folder there are extra copies of the SOP 13 in case you want it as well as GENCO phone numbers in case Allegheny calls. 

Hopefully this will help create some consistency on nights and provide the day people access to the MDEA load sheets.  If you have any questions please give me a ring.

Happy Holidays,

Carrie 

(713-623-8764 or 832-453-7575)

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Don,

AEP has informed us over the past couple of nights that they MUST HAVE tag numbers in order to do next day checkouts.  They claim that this has always been the case but we know that in the past we have not needed the tag #'s in order to check out. It appears AEP enjoys being difficult.  So it looks like going forward we will need tag numbers from the schedulers in order to check our properly with AEP.

Seely

Subject: *Updated* Nightly Duties and MDEA Load sheets folder



Hello all, 

Attached is an updated sheet regarding what needs to be done at night regarding MDEA and our old nightly duties. 

Also there is now a folder near the MAPP printer (between Dean and Don) that will include all the nightly faxes and load sheets.  The folder will help us keep track of what has been faxed in case EES trans calls complaining.  The load sheets are needed for the daily forecasting expained in the SOP 13 Dean sent out last week. In the folder there are extra copies of the SOP 13 in case you want it as well as GENCO phone numbers in case Allegheny calls. 

Hopefully this will help create some consistency on nights and provide the day people access to the MDEA load sheets.  If you have any questions please give me a ring.

Happy Holidays, 

Carrie 

(713-623-8764 or 832-453-7575)

Friends" is this weekend.  We will be in Galveston starting Friday

take
it easy

Saturday afternoon play around/tail gate party and go to float site no
later
than 4 p.m.
Saturday 5:00 p.m. Parade float judging
Saturday Parade begins 6:00 p.m.  I still do not know the exact location
of
where "the family" designated section will be but I will know by
week-end.
Hopefully, you guys will be saints again and drive our car for us.
Saturday night, Brew Ha-Ha at the Victorian (wind down party).  Everyone

parade!

>We reget to inform you that, effective immediately, Santa Claus will no
>longer be able to serve the Southern United States on Christmas Eve. Due to
>the overwhelming current population of the earth, his contract was
>renegotiated by North American Fairies and Elves Local 210, and he now
>serves only certain areas of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and
>Michigan.
>
>As part of the new and better contract, Santa will also get longer breaks
>for milk and cookies, so keep that in mind. Your children will not be
>ignored on Christmas Eve - they will be in the good hands of your local
>replacement, Santa's second cousin, Bubba Claus. His side of the family is
>from the South Pole. He shares Santa's goal of delivering toys to all the
>good boys and girls, however, you may notice a few differences in the
>service. For example:
>
>1. There is no danger of a Grinch stealing your presents from Bubba Claus.
>He has a gun rack on his sleigh and a bumper sticker that reads "These toys
>insured by Smith and Wesson."
>
>2. Instead of milk and cookies, Bubba Claus prefers that children leave an
>RC cola and pork rinds or a moon pie on the fireplace. And Bubba doesn't
>smoke a pipe, though he dips a little snuff, so please have an empty spit
>can handy.
>
>3. Bubba Claus' sleigh is pulled by floppy-eared flyin' coon dogs instead
>of reindeer. Reindeer were once mistakenly issued to Bubba Claus, who now
>has a couple more nice trophy heads over his fireplace.
>
>4. You won't hear "On Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and Blitzen ..." when
>Bubba Claus arrives. Instead, you'll hear, "On Ernhardt, on Wallace, on
>Martin and Petty...."
>
>5. "Ho, ho, ho!" will be replaced by "Yee-haw!" And you also are likely to
>hear Bubba's elves respond in unison, "I hear'd dat!"
>
>6. As required by Southern highway laws, Bubba Claus' sleigh does have a
>Yosemite Sam safety triangle on the back with the words "Back Off." He also
>has a few other decorations on his sleigh back as well, such as a string of
>flashing Christmas lights around the license plate, and a caricature of
>Santa Claus going wee-wee on the Tooth Fairy.
>
>7. The usual Christmas movie classics such as "Miracle on 34th Street" and
>"It's a Wonderful Life" will not be shown in your negotiated viewing area.
>Instead, you'll see "Boss Hogg Saves Christmas" and "Smokey and the Bandit
>V" featuring Burt Reynolds as Bubba Claus and dozens of state patrol cars
>crashing into each other.
>
>8. Bubba Claus doesn't wear a belt. You should make sure that the wife and
>the kids turn the other way when he bends over to put presents under the
>tree.
>
>9. And finally, Christmas songs about Santa Claus, such as "Rudolph The
>Red-Nosed Reindeer" and "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town" will be replaced on
>all AM radio stations in the South by your new official Christmas carol,
>"Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer."
>
>YEE-HAW!!! MERRY CHRISTMAS!

Dear Investor,

By now, the scope of the opportunity -- at least to
most people -- is crystal clear.

China is one of the world's last great growth markets.
An arena where nimble companies and savvy investors
will reap OBSCENE PROFITS for years to come.

China's GDP is growing at a 7%+ annual clip; and its
entry into the World Trade Organization and successful
bid to host the 2008 Olympics, legitimize its place in
the modern world.  Name almost any industry, and I can
show you how it will profit from the China Phenomenon.

BUT IF YOU pushed me to select just one...to name the
single industry where the profits will be virtually
unlimited, I would say this: The Chinese WIRELESS
explosion is your ticket to true wealth.

*Mainland China passed the U.S. this year in sheer
number of wireless subscribers. Yet the percentage of
its population with access to telecom services is
still just a paltry 9%.

*Spending on telecom infrastructure will EXPLODE over
the next several years.  China's government plans to
spend an additional $151 BILLION by 2005.

*What's more, while spending in Europe and the U.S.
has dried up this year, investment in China has
SOARED!  Capital spending is some 66% ahead of last
year's levels.

*Demand is growing briskly.  At the end of 2000, China
had 267 million telecom subscribers.  By 2004, that
number will reach 691 MILLION!  And wireless -- the
platform most favored by government and the general
populace -- will grow nearly 75% this year!

IT'S OBVIOUS to anyone paying attention...the
OPPORTUNITY IS HUGE!  But...the very biggest profits --
life-changing profits -- will come from a source VERY
SURPRISING to most investors.

Who do you think might be the biggest beneficiaries of
all this growth?  Lucent, which has really good
technology in this area?  Texas Instruments, the chip-
maker that supplies the chips used in most digital
phones?  Or maybe one of the quasi-governmental
Chinese companies with an "inside track?"

That, my friend, is the SURPRISING PART of this
MONSTER GROWTH story.  The big winner won't be any one
of those choices -- or any other big-name firm you
might think of.

No indeed, the BIG WINNER -- and a real prize for
savvy investors who get in now -- will be a little,
but already profitable, company headquartered in
Alameda, California.  IT'S A NAME that 99% of all
investors have never heard of.  But it's a name that
you -- if you act now -- will remember with great
fondness for the rest of your life.

The story starts with something called "PHS
technology."

You see, the wireless technology you're used to in
this country uses cellular networks that deploy large,
powerful base stations to service a wide area.  But
PHS technology uses large amounts of small stations --
on telephone poles, stop signs and the like -- to
saturate densely populated urban areas.

And that's why this technology will dominate the China
market.

90% of Chinese wireless subscribers are "intra-city"
users.  They don't often travel.  They spend most of
their time living and working in the same, densely
populated area.  And that, my friend, is the perfect
match for PHS technology.

WHAT'S MORE, PHS is 5-times cheaper than the other
technologies.  That also makes it the perfect choice
in a country where the average person earns less than
$4,000 a year!  No wonder the PHS market is booming --
I expect it to grow ten-times bigger over the next few
years.

It's a spectacular opportunity.  And the little U.S.
company I'm recommending to my California Technology
Stock Letter (CTSL) subscribers right now...is the BEST
WAY for investors like you to profit from the China
wireless boom.

At CTSL, we specialize in staying AHEAD OF THE CURVE
-- and reaping huge profits ahead of the crowd, when
the true fortunes are made:

*We jumped on Intel in 1994, when most analysts
scoffed at its prospects.  Three years later, we sold
for 575% GAINS.

*In July 1998, Power Integrations got no respect on
Wall Street.  But I practically screamed at clients
to, "BUY!" -- because unlike most analysts I actually
understood its breakthrough technologies.  We better
than tripled our money in less than six months' time.

*DUSA Pharmaceuticals was going begging in 1998 when
we gobbled up all we could.  Our 1,316% gains turned
$25,000 into more than $350,000.

NOW TODAY, wireless is the name of the game.  China is
where it's at.  And this little company from Alameda,
California is ready to rock!  How high can it go?
Think 50% profits near-term.  Long term, the sky's the
limit.  You'll get the name, full details and my "buy
under" price when you accept a RISK-FREE trial
subscription to my California Technology Stock Letter
now.

As you'll see:

*This company has a top-flight management team -- one
of the best in the industry.  And its laser-like focus
on telecom's fastest growth markets has kept it out of
the recent troubles many competitors have faced.

*Business is booming.  The company has a solid backlog
of orders.  And it's on track to generate 54% year-
over-year top-line growth.

*Its financial model is solid.  The company should
earn about 64 cents a share this year and 86 cents in
2002.  That represents 45% and 34% year-over-year
growth, respectively.  Gross margins are running at a
fat 35%.

*And these guys have staying power.  I'm particularly
impressed by this company's commitment to R&D.  896 of
its 2,041 employees -- or 44% -- are engineers.  And
the R&D budget runs at a healthy 10% of sales.

THAT MAKES this stock a short and long-term winner in
my book.  And the single best way for you to profit --
in a really BIG WAY -- from the wireless revolution
transforming communications in China.

Technology Stock Letter RISK-FREE.  Click here now:

Yours Sincerely,

Michael Murphy
Editor, California Technology Stock Letter

P.S.  I founded CTSL back in 1982 -- years before it
was "hip" to be a tech investor.  Quite simply, I
understood the technologies and saw a HUGE opportunity
for a select group of investors to rack up oversized
profits.  And my loyal CTSL subscribers have done just
that -- enjoying average annualized returns on all
CTSL recommendations of 53% since 1982.  Now as I look
ahead, our prospects have never been brighter.  There
are fortunes to be made in 2002 and for many years to
come.  DON'T MISS OUT.  Go here now:

Should we give this to our husbands???

                           CAKE or BED?

         A HUSBAND IS AT HOME WATCHING
         A FOOTBALL GAME  WHEN HIS WIFE
         INTERRUPTS, "HONEY, COULD YOU FIX THE
         LIGHT IN THE  HALLWAY?
         IT'S BEEN FLICKERING FOR WEEKS NOW,"
         HE LOOKS AT HER AND SAYS
         ANGRILY; "FIX THE LIGHT? NOW?
         DOES IT LOOK LIKE I HAVE A GE LOGO
         PRINTED ON  MY FOREHEAD? I DON'T THINK SO!"
         THE WIFE ASKS, "WELL THEN, COULD YOU FIX
         THE FRIDGE  DOOR? IT WON'T CLOSE RIGHT."
         TO WHICH HE REPLIED, "FIX THE FRIDGE DOOR?
         DOES IT LOOK LIKE I HAVE
         WESTINGHOUSE WRITTEN ON MY FOREHEAD? I
         DON'T THINK SO."
         "FINE," SHE SAYS "THEN YOU COULD AT
         LEAST  FIX THE STEPS TO THE FRONT
         DOOR? THEY'RE ABOUT TO BREAK,"
         "I'M NOT A DAMN CARPENTER AND I DON'T
          WANT TO FIX STEPS," HE SAYS. "DOES
          IT LOOK LIKE I HAVE ACE HARDWARE WRITTEN
          ON MY FOREHEAD? I DON'T THINK
          SO. I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU. I'M GOING TO
          THE BAR !!!"
          SO HE GOES TO THE BAR AND DRINKS FOR A
          COUPLE OF HOURS. HE STARTS TO FEEL
          GUILTY ABOUT HOW HE TREATED HIS WIFE,
          AND DECIDES TO GO HOME AND HELP OUT.
          AS HE WALKS INTO THE HOUSE HE NOTICES
          THE STEPS ARE ALREADY FIXED. AS HE
          ENTERS THE HOUSE, HE SEES THE HALL LIGHT
          IS WORKING. AS HE GOES TO GET
          A BEER, HE NOTICES THE FRIDGE DOOR IS
          FIXED.
          'HONEY," HE ASKS, "HOW'D ALL THIS GET
          FIXED?"
          SHE SAID,
          "WELL, WHEN YOU LEFT I SAT OUTSIDE
          AND CRIED. JUST THEN A NICE
          YOUNG MAN ASKED ME WHAT WAS WRONG,
          AND I TOLD HIM. HE OFFERED TO DO ALL THE
          REPAIRS, AND ALL I HAD TO DO
         WAS EITHER GO TO BED WITH HIM OR BAKE A
          CAKE."
          HE SAID, "SO WHAT KIND OF CAKE DID YOU
          BAKE HIM?"

          SHE REPLIED, "HELLOOOOO.......DO YOU SEE
         BETTY CROCKER WRITTEN ON MY FOREHEAD?
         I DON'T THINK SO!"

INVESTools Advisory
Compiled by John Brobst, INVESTools.com


1. Profiting from the Post-September 21 Rebound (GNSS)

The stock market bottomed on September 21 and a new bull
market is now underway, says Don Rowe. In a recent hotline
to subscribers, he supports this assertion by listing the
post-September 21 performance of a number of major indices.
These include the DJIA (+23%), Nasdaq (+43%), tech-heavy
Nasdaq 100 (+51%) and semiconductor index (+63%). "Become
fully invested," he advises.

One of Rowe's current stock picks is Genesis Microchip
(GNSS), a top maker of integrated circuits (IC) that process
graphic images and digital video. The firm's image
processing ICs are used in flat-panel displays, digital TVs
and consumer video products. Q3 saw earnings grow 190% on a
141% sales gain thanks to higher operating margins and
rising shipments.

Rowe also recommends the Nasdaq 100 Index Tracking Stock
(QQQ) as "a good long-term investment." Sponsored by a
subsidiary of the Nasdaq exchange, QQQ offers a portfolio of
the stocks that make up the Nasdaq 100 index. Rowe praises
the diversification QQQ offers; the Nasdaq 100 currently
includes companies in computer hardware and software,
telecom, retail and wholesale trade, and biotech.

For more on Don Rowe's advice see "Market Commentary and
Investment Summary," December 2001, The Wall Street Digest.
Momentum investor Donald Rowe targets stocks and mutual
funds capable of generating 26+% annual returns.

2. Year 2001 Picks +36%, New Advice Just Released (CSPLF)

At the beginning of 2001, Frank Curzio published 10 stock
picks he felt would outperform this year. His year-end
follow-up report shows he was right; Curzio's stocks gained
36% this year vs. declines of 30.7% for the Nasdaq, 6.2% for
the DJIA and 15.4% for the S&P 500.

For 2002, Curzio recommends accumulating undervalued oil &
gas stocks saying the sector "will advance sharply next year
from current lows." He offers three aggressive selections,
and one of them is Canada Southern Petroleum (CSPLF). The
company explores and develops areas of the US and Canada
believed to contain oil and gas reserves. Curzio is
especially bullish about prospects for its 30% stake in the
Kotaneelee gas field.

Curzio also recommends three conservative oil & gas plays
including the giant Chevron Texaco (CVX). Management says
the merger of Chevron and Texaco will save $1.8 billion by
March 2003. It owns 30% of a project to take oil from a
Venezuelan region that contains the world's largest known
hydrocarbon deposit. Curzio quotes estimates of 2.1 billion
barrels from this reservoir. "Buy," he says.

For more on Frank Curzio's advice see "Latest Stock and
Market News," December 2001, The FXC Newsletter. Francis X.
Curzio provides asset growth and capital preservation with a
list of picks in key categories.

-----------------------------------------------------------
3. "Security Portfolio" Off to a Flying Start (NETA)

In late November 2001, newsletter watcher Gregory Spear
launched what he calls his "Security Portfolio" of stocks
recommended by his favored investment advisors. These
particular stocks should benefit from heightened attention
to security and safety in travel, business, commerce,
communications and medicine. In one month, this model
portfolio gained 10.45%, outpacing the S&P 500 (+2.64%) and
the Nasdaq composite (+9.56%).

Spear just added three new positions to this portfolio. One
is Network Associates (NETA), a stock that enjoys buy
recommendations from Dan Sullivan (The Chartist) and Jim
Collins (OTC Insight). Network Associates makes the popular
McAfee line of anti-virus software along with other programs
that help corporations and governments manage their network
security concerns.

Experts say malicious attacks on networks doubled in 2001
and are likely to keep growing in number. Spear holds that
IT managers will opt for veteran security providers like
Network Associates, and he adds that the market agrees as
the stock is on a tear. He also points to higher spending on
security despite IT budget cuts. "We like Network Associates
on dips," he says.

Letters," December 10, 2001, The Spear Report. Consensus
stock picks from the best performing advisory services in
the US today.

4. A Safe Tech Bet for Low-Risk Investors (EDS)

Wall Street analysts upped their ratings for Electronic Data
Systems (EDS) after it beat estimates by a penny per share.
That prompted a buy recommendation from brokerage watcher
Ben Zacks. The consulting giant offers systems integration,
network and systems operations, data center management and
other services.

Zacks notes that EDS gets new business in down economies as
companies cut other expenses to fund systems projects that
cut costs and improve productivity. For instance, EDS just
won a $1.5 billion contract extension from Xerox along with
a $2.2 billion contract earlier this year with Sabre, the
airline reservation management system.

EDS earned $0.44 a share last quarter. But Zacks subtracts
an after-tax acquisitions charge and concludes that the firm
posted a profit of $334 million ($0.69 per share). Stock in
EDS trades at 26x this year's EPS estimate of $2.66, and
Zacks predicts shares will reach $80 by mid-2002. "EDS is a
safe technology name for low-risk tolerant investors," Zacks
says.

For more on Ben Zacks' advice see "Hotline," December 10,
2001, Zacks Advisor. Ben Zacks uses earnings estimate
revisions from analysts at brokerages to select stocks
likely to outperform the market over the next 12 months.

5. Three Promising New Economy Stocks Below $10 (SSYS)

Rich Moroney says the phrase "new economy" turns the
stomachs of many investors as they view the late 1990s
rally as a scam. "But not all of it was hype," he says.
Technology continues to transform the US economy, and the
end of the tech bubble doesn't alter long-term fundamentals.
"The stage is set for a recovery," he says, and he offers
three attractive bargains for year-ahead gains.

One of Moroney's selections is Stratasys (SSYS). Giants like
GM, Lockheed Martin and Motorola use the tiny firm's
products to create 3D prototypes from plastic. With the
firm's machines, customers can cut the time to make
prototypes from weeks to hours.

Moroney likes how Stratasys chalked up strong profit gains
in a tough economic climate. Last quarter, EPS rocketed to
$0.18 from $0.03 a year ago; analysts had predicted a paltry
$0.04. Strong demand for new models boosted sales 8%. The
firm has $8 million in cash on hand, or $1.45 per share.
With a market cap of just $30 million, Stratasys "is a small
fry compared to rivals," Moroney says. "The stock is rated
'best buy.'"

For more on Rich Moroney's advice see "Three Tech Stocks
Below $10," December 3, 2001, Low Priced Stock Survey.
Richard Moroney offers fundamentally solid small- and mid-
caps ready to soar 40% to 400%+.

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

=20

=20

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=
ies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will b=
e incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als=
o be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations=
, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) =
507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Bu=
ilding, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (=
713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be consi=
dered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders i=
n connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their d=
irect or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are availab=
le in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

Happy New Year, ClearHeads!
Welcome to the ClearStation News for January.  This month
we cover recent site news and give you a preview of exciting
changes to our Recommend and Help areas.

------------------------------------------------------------
Movin' On Up - About our new home
------------------------------------------------------------

In mid-November we took ClearStation offline in order to
move the site to  a new home in an E*TRADE co-location
facility. (Notice our new url,http://clearstation.etrade.com).
This substantially reduces our operating costs and helps
ensure ClearStation's continued existence as a free site.
Unfortunately, some issues arose during the move that we
hadn't foreseen. We apologize for the poor performanceof the
site in the weeks following the move.

We regret the problems that arose, and can safely say that
most of them have been corrected.  If you experience
problems with delayed or incorrect quotes, login problems,
poor site performance or broken graphs please send us an
email with your user name and a detailed description of the
problem.

support@clearstation.com


------------------------------------------------------------
Recommend 2.0: Ask and you shall receive!
------------------------------------------------------------

We've been getting lots of feedback and requests about our
Recommend feature, so we rolled the best of them into
Recommend 2.0. You'll be able to rate other ClearHeads, see
graphs of each Recommend portfolio's sector holdings (by
percentage), select an "investment type" for each
Recommendation, and view realized gains and losses.  Start
paring down your Recommend lists, because the new format
only allows forty open recommendations. Watch for more info
about Recommend 2.0 in the coming weeks. Just can't wait?
Send us your questions.

support@clearstation.com


------------------------------------------------------------
Help 2.0
------------------------------------------------------------

Our Help area is being overhauled, so watch out for a new
look and feel plus updated content (including a section on
the new Recommend). There's still time to get your two cents
in: if there's anything you'd like to see covered in Help,
let us know!

feedback@clearstation.com


------------------------------------------------------------
Tell It Like It Is
------------------------------------------------------------

Topic-Based Discussion

http://www.clearstation.etrade.com/cgi-bin/discuss

The latest addition to the top nav is a link to our topic-
based discussion area. Join the ClearHeads already talking
about Day Trading, Trading Strategies, and Market Direction.
Since we know there's more to life than the stock market,
we've included an Off-Topic discussion forum. Don't forget,
it's your community - make sure to let us know if you have
an idea for a new topic. Send email to:

discusstopic@clearstation.com

Two bored  casino dealers were waiting at a craps table.  A very attractive blonde  woman arrived and bet $20,000 on a single roll of the dice.
She said, "I  hope you don't mind, but I feel much luckier when I'm completely  nude."
With that she stripped from her neck down, rolled the dice and  yelled, "Mama needs new clothes!"
Then she hollered..."YES! YES! I WON! I  WON!" She jumped up and down and hugged each of the dealers. With that she  picked up all the money and clothes and quickly departed.
The dealers  just stared at each other dumbfounded.
Finally, one of them asked, "What  did she roll?"
The other answered, "I thought YOU were  watching!"
Moral: Not all blondes are dumb, but most men are  perverts??????

At my Technology Investing advisory, we reap HUGE
GAINS from the opportunities other investors miss.

OUR SECRET WEAPON?  A laser-like focus on All-Tech,
All-the-Time.  You see, most investment advisors pride
themselves on a broad reach across dozens of industries.
They claim that gives you more opportunities to profit.

But that's JUST BALONEY.  There's no way one
individual -- or even a substantial team -- can spread
himself that thin and still do quality research...especially
when it comes to the complex world of high tech.

That's why my team and I do ONE THING, and one thing only.
We target the hottest growth markets of technology -- from
microchips to software to biotech.  And we reap the profits
 most investors miss.

DID YOU OWN Immunex, for example?

I'm sure by now you've heard of Amgen's buyout of this
fast-growing biotech firm.  When that deal was announced
yesterday, it included a 17% premium for our Immunex stock.
But our profits -- locked in after I advised clients to
sell in an urgent email bulletin -- were much higher than
that.  We banked 105% GAINS in just 8-months' time.

I hope you owned Immunex.  But if you didn't, don't worry
about it.  In just a moment I'll tell you all about my c
urrent #1 PICK -- another overlooked stock that should
DOUBLE YOUR MONEY at least in 2002....then multiply it
5-times over by 2007.

BUT FIRST, an important lesson to be learned from Immunex.
Don't believe everything you hear on Wall Street.

Back when we bought Immunex, traders were down on almost
everything related to the drug industry.  And I agreed with
them -- to a point.  You see, the big drug companies are
facing intense pressure from generic drug-makers.  Merck's
big disappointment is a perfect example -- 0% earnings growth
next year.  That's pitiful in today's drug hungry world.

But as the baby boomers pass into their "golden years,"
drugs are still a HUGE PLAY.  just not in the traditional
way.  Most big pharma companies -- like Merck, Pfizer and
J&J -- have really slipped when it comes to new drug
development.

But INNOVATIVE biotechs like Immunex are a totally different
story.  Their R&D is RED-HOT.  So when Wall Street tarred
the traditional firms and biotechs with the same brush...we
stepped in to pick Immunex up for a song.

Eight months later, we're 105% RICHER.  Now, we're about to
pull off another profit coup just like it -- but with MUCH
BIGGER potential.  And this time around, YOU have the
opportunity to join us.

Here's the truth about today's so-called communications
"fiber glut" that everyone keeps talking about:

WHEN the World Trade Center got hit, the Internet slowed
down -- very noticeably slowed down.  In fact, it nearly
came to a grinding halt!  That means there isn't nearly
enough capacity or redundancy built into the system to
accommodate a blip in demand.

Sources tell me that the government is very worried about
this problem.  After all, this is the second time it's
happened.  Back in July, a tunnel fire in Baltimore slowed
the Internet to a crawl for two full days.

That means our communications systems -- and therefore our
economy -- are very, very vulnerable.

Ten years ago, it wouldn't have mattered.  But today,
commerce and security is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on those
systems.  Virtually nothing moves without it.  That's how
banks and brokerages transfer funds...how dispatchers route
fleets of trucks...how many Americans get paid through
direct deposit.

And we are closer to the BREAKING POINT than 99.9% of
Americans even begin to understand.  Here's one example.

Qwest -- one of America's biggest carriers -- recently said
they're 60% loaded on their network.  That doesn't sound
too bad...until you understand how these networks operate.
You can't load a network much past 65%.  In fact, 70% is
virtually CATASTROPHIC -- because the network spends so
much time searching for open channels, it doesn't spend any
time actually sending packets of information.

The system locks.  Communications stops.  The nation comes
to a standstill.

AMERICA IS FALLING BEHIND the rest of the developed world.
Internet traffic systems currently run faster in Australia,
Europe and even South America.  That's because we push out
more data than everyone else -- but we're not increasing
capacity at anywhere near the needed rate.

We've got to catch up -- and we've got to catch up fast!
Otherwise business, the economy and our national security
all go in the CRAPPER.

BUT WHY do we have this capacity problem amidst a "fiber glut?"
Because  95% of all the fiber that has ever been laid is
"dark" -- that is, it's not activated.  And the company I'm
recommending is the #1 supplier of the components needed to do
the job.  I'm looking at a DOUBLE -- possibly a TRIPLE by
this time next year.  And I fully expect to multiply our money
five-times over by 2007.  In fact, this stock truly has
"ten-bagger" potential!

At the height of the boom, this company's stock was nearly
20-times higher.  So what changed?  Spending on communications
networks dried up.  Now the government is ready to pump
$100 billion in emergency spending into the economy; interest
rates are practically zero; and the need isn't just vital
for the economy anymore -- it's a question of NATIONAL
SECURITY!

Please don't miss out.  You'll kick yourself big-time if you
do. Get this company's name -- and full details -- in my
urgent profit bulletin: 5-Times Richer By 2007.  It's yours
FREE, simply for accepting a 100% RISK-FREE trial subscription
to my Technology Investing advisory.

TAKE a full six months to measure the value of my advice for
yourself.  Don't like what you see...don't make the profits
you want, just cancel, and your subscription doesn't cost
you a dime.   That's reason enough to give it a try.  Because
if I'm right -- and I'm staking my reputation and my own money
on this call -- you can double your money, at least, in 12
months...and make your fortune several times over in the
coming years.

Please don't miss out.  Give yourself a chance.  At least take
a look at Technology Investing to see what you think.  Our
unusual six-month guarantee of total satisfaction means my
advisory costs you nothing if you don't 100% approve.

P.S.  The longer you wait, the more profits you MISS OUT on.
This stock has a long ways to run -- but it's already UP 41%
since October 1st, in recognition of this company's vital new
role in national security.

Dark fiber does no good.  Actual carrying capacity is strained
to the limits.  And get this --- data traffic is DOUBLING every
year now.  That means a network running at 63% of capacity needs
to double its load by this time next year just to keep up.
That's why the fiber must be lit.  That's why the fiber will be
lit.  Click here to take advantage of this opportunity now.

Hey guys,

I need to let you guys know what is going on with the desk. The winter is f=
ast approaching and it will be cold soon, and OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE MONEY W=
ILL PRESENT themselves. We have some very young talent on the desk, so we n=
eed to work extra hard to get ourselves prepared! The money has slowed down=
 on the physical side, and we need to continue to work the relationships in=
 anticipation of the winter. We need to hit the phones extra hard in the we=
eks to come. Please make sure you have access to all the oasis sites and be=
come very familiar with what it takes to move power region to region. I don=
't want to miss a blow-out day because someone on the desk is unfamiliar wi=
th a region or hasn't done that specific transaction. I want everyone to co=
ntinue to work new deals, however if it doesn't make sense, get out of it, =
make it work, or use that relationship to help you out when your in trouble=
 down the road. From November 15 - February 15 of last year, we made close =
to 2 millions dollars. It might be slow now, but we need to minimize the mi=
stakes, and make some money.

Let me know if you have any questions.

CLaiborne.  If you would like to email me that you will help please email
your NAME, ADDRESS, AND PHONE to ccvca@ev1.net  *(Note:  We do not send

to me in text form and I will email it to you later.  You may not be aware,
but I have received several virus from people on the ccvevents list.
Luckily, I caught them before they attached my system  Happy emailing.)

At this time I will need a hard copy of the for for set up . All should be

Arch Committee Report

Setup December 1st - Takedown January 5th

Arch Setup is scheduled for Saturday (December 1) with completion on Sunday
(December 2) if needed.

I have a few volunteers that have stated they willing to help on those days
but as always could use more. I will have a short meeting with the volunteers
at my house on Thursday before setup. The more help the faster we can
complete the Holiday Decorations. Last year we where able to setup the arches
in one day. I would like to do the same this your. Men ,Women, and Teens are
asked to help. The process consists of assembly of the arch (men needed), tie
the light onto the arch with plastic ties (anyone) and then erecting the Arch
(4 men). We will divide up in to due teams that will move down the street
performing their part. Clean holes if needed, assemble arches, check lights,
attach lights to arches, retest lights and stand arch At least one
experiences arch volunteer from last year will be on each team as the lead .
If we get an early star we can complete the setup in one day. I would like to
start at 8:30 am on Saturday (Dec.1). We can meet at the Church at 8:00 am
and delegate duties to groups We will leave from the Church at 8:30 am and
start the setups. Those helping may want to bring a pair of gloves and wire
cutters or side cutters for the ties. O' yes, for those that helped last
year, we will have the chicken gumbo again. I hope that is OK.

We would like to have all setup fees in before setup day. I will have a
mailbox in front of my house to drop the fee in with your setup form. If you
do not send in your form and would like to have your arch setup we will
except the fee on Saturday of setup. This fee collection is time consuming
and would like not have to deal the fee on setup day. It is the residents
responsibility to have the arch parts accessible by 8:30am on the setup
Saturday. We will have extra light strings for those that need to purchase
replacements.

If you would like to have your Arch set up please have the following items
completed and ready by Saturday (December 1).


Requirement for Setup of existing Arches:

All Arch holes will need to be cleaned, by washing out with water prior to
setup day.

All Arch pieces will need to be places at Arch hole of the resident (Arch
Partner) that will plug in the lights.

All lights are to be tested and bad lights replaced. Bulbs available at Hobby
Lobby.

Extension cord laid out for light check prior to Arch Erection.

All arch parts accessible by 8:30am Saturday Dec.1.

I cannot believe that it is already November and we need to be ready for
Chirstmas in the Village.  Craig and the arch team can use our help.  Let him
know if you can lend a hand.  Mary G. Strickland

Don...  Chuck  updated me on the status of our discussions re. trading and creating a  TradersNews Energy product on EOL.
 
I fully understand  that corporately, you have a lot on your plate right now and we will be  patient.  I would like to meet with you in a few weeks when the dust  settles a bit.
 
I do have a one  quick question....  My sources indicate that Enron has agreed to place a  Megawatt-Daily Cinergy Hourly product on EOL within 2 weeks.  Is this a  true statement?
 
Please RSVP  ....  Thanks

Hey guys,=20

I need to let you guys know what is going on with the desk. The winter is f=
ast approaching and it will be cold soon, and OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE MONEY W=
ILL PRESENT themselves. We have some very young talent on the desk, so we n=
eed to work extra hard to get ourselves prepared! The money has slowed down=
 on the physical side, and we need to continue to work the relationships in=
 anticipation of the winter. We need to hit the phones extra hard in the we=
eks to come. Please make sure you have access to all the oasis sites and be=
come very familiar with what it takes to move power region to region. I don=
't want to miss a blow-out day because someone on the desk is unfamiliar wi=
th a region or hasn't done that specific transaction. I want everyone to co=
ntinue to work new deals, however if it doesn't make sense, get out of it, =
make it work, or use that relationship to help you out when your in trouble=
 down the road. From November 15 - February 15 of last year, we made close =
to 2 millions dollars. It might be slow now, but we need to minimize the mi=
stakes, and make some money.

Let me know if you have any questions.=20

We are currently receiving a number of resumes from Enron.  These resumes
are very welcome as we have a number of positions we are trying to fill.
If you know anyone from Enron who is currently seeking employment, please
have them forward their resume via e-mail to ahoge@cmsenergy.com and state
what type of position they'd be interested in.  This will enable us to sort
through the e-mails most efficiently.  If you know any good potential
candidates from Enron, please get the word out that we are looking to fill
a number of positions and encourage them to send their resumes.  Remember,
anyone you forward should be someone you would be willing to recommend as a
"good hire" to the company.  Thanks, -Alyce

All,

The Enpower Database is in need of some routine maintenance and clean-up.  The work is designed to improve performance and expandability for the future.  We were hoping to utilize the Thanksgiving holiday to perform some of this work.  What we need from you guys is permission to have some agreed upon downtime for Enpower over the holidays so we can run some clean-up jobs on the database.  However, we do need to execute the jobs in such a way as to have a minimal impact on the Real Time trading desks.  Here is our plan as was previously discussed with David Poston:

Wed Nov 21, 8pm - 10pm Central (6pm - 8pm Portland), for unrelated hardware maintenance

Beginning Saturday thru Sunday, rolling 3 hour outages:
(NOTE:  during the below times, the system may not actually be totally down, but error messages may occur so don't be alarmed)

Starting Saturday morning at 10am (8am Portland Time) we will be contacting the East & West Real Time Desks to determine if they can afford a 3 hour down-time window.  When the clean-up job is completed, we will contact the related desks that the Enpower application is now available.  We will then want to keep the environment stable for at least an hour to allow the traders to catch up from the down-time.  We will repeat this process during the following time periods.

Saturday, November 24nd from 10am (8am Portland) - Saturday, November 24th @ 6pm (4pm Portland)
Saturday, November 24nd from 8pm (6pm Portland) - Sunday, November 25th @ 8am (6am Portland)
Sunday, November 25th from 10am (8am Portland) - Sunday, November 25th @ 6pm (4pm Portland)

Contact numbers during this maintenance are:

Portland's Trader on-call  1-800-684-1336
Michael Berger (desk) 713-345-3190 (active DBA)
Chip Brewer (cell) 281-960-7066 (escalation DBA)
DBA on-call 1 - 888-993-3793
DBA on-call 2 - 888-993-3795
EnPower on-call  713-553-3758
Risk on-call  713-857-5746

Please forward to others that may be affected.

Thanks, Dave Nommensen

Subject: Ski  Trip 2002
Hello Everyone,
 
Well, I looked around again for another  inexpensive ski trip for us to take this year.  The path has seemed to  lead the same direction as it did last year.  Lake Tahoe is by far  the cheapest package deal I can find.  I have already spoken to most of  you who went last year and everyone seems to agree it was a good time and  great atmosphere.  The dates for this adventure are leaving the  evening of January 30th (Wed.) and returning on Febuary 3rd  (Sun.).
 
The vacation package is through Southwest  Airlines Vacations.
 
We will stay at the Horizon Casino for 4  nights.
 
We will depart:
Houston Hobby Airport @ 4:50 pm with a short stop  in Las Vegas and arrive into Reno at 9:20 pm.  We will then go by Charter  bus to Lake Tahoe.
 
Leaving Lake Tahoe:
Our plane will depart Reno at 12:10 pm on direct  route to Houston arriving at 6:50 pm.
 
And you ask how much for all this  excitement?
 
This can be all yours for 359.75 per  person.  This price is for two people per room.  I will need to know  who would like to go no later than Wednesday afternoon so I can set up  reservations.  These trips are booking fast.  We will be able to do  like last year.  I will call in the reservations and then each individual  person will be able to call Southwest directly and bill the trip to their own  credit card.  The only other expenses to be prepaid are for ski lift  tickets and roundtrip transfer from the airport to the hotel and back.   This cost is $30.  I figure we will discuss the lift ticket  options.  Some people may want to Snowmobile a day or do something  else.  We will discuss these options further after the trip is  set.
 
Hope to see everyone there.  The snow is  looking good up there so far.  They had 24" on the mountain  yesterday.
 
Mason is going.  I just don't have his  e-mail address but he said to count him in.
 
Scott  Tichavsky

Feudalism - You have two cows. Your lord takes some of  the milk.  
Fascism - You have two cows. The  government takes both, hires
you to take care of them, and sells you the  milk.  
Communism - You have two cows. Your  neighbors help take care
of them and you share the  milk.  
Totalitarianism - You have two cows.  The government takes
them both and denies they ever existed and drafts you  into the
army. Milk is banned.  
Capitalism -  You have two cows. You sell one and buy a
bull. Your herd multiplies, and the  economy grows. You sell them
and retire on the  income.  
Enron Venture Capitalism - You have  two cows. You sell
three of them to your publicly listed company, using  letters of
credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute  
debt/equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get
all  four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows. The milk
rights of the  six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a
Cayman Island company  secretly owned by the majority shareholder
who sells the rights to all seven  cows back to your listed
company. The annual report says the company owns  eight cows, with
an option on one more.

Subject: FW: Big Boy harvested


Jeff Duncan of Sanger, Texas shot the deer they call "Big Boy" at Hagerman
National Wildlife Refuge in Grayson County with a bow on Sunday afternoon.
His gross B&C score green score is 234 3/8, and net green score is 230
6/8.
He will be a new Texas state archery record.  The deer is believed to be
10.5 years old, at least.  He has been photographed and videoed several
times in the past, and was actually shot 2 years ago on private land, but
the arrow passed through his hindquarters, and he survived.
Congratulations
to Jeff.  The story will probably be in Sunday's Dallas Morning News.
Jeff hasn't quit smiling since Sunday.

COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) - Football practice was delayed on Tuesday
 for nearly two hours at Texas A&M University.

One of the players, while on his way to the locker room, happened to
look down and notice a suspicious looking, unknown white powdery
substance on the practice field. Practice was immediately suspended by
Coach R.C.
Slocum while the FBI was called in to investigate.

After a complete field analysis, the FBI determined that the foreign
white substance that they found was the goal line.

THE GOOD OIL

Oil-industry consolidation continues, as PHILLIPS PETROLEUM and CONOCO
announced a $15 billion all-share merger. The new company, to be called
ConocoPhillips, is likely to be the sixth-biggest producer in the
world, based on revenues.

NORMANDY MINING, of Australia, wooed by rival bids from America's
NEWMONT MINING and South Africa's ANGLOGOLD, rejected AngloGold's
all-share bid. This paves the way for a possible sweetened
counter-offer from AngloGold, the world's second-largest gold producer.

ENRON'S financial turmoil worsened. But the Texan energy giant managed
to put off repayment of some debts until mid-December. Enron's shares
plunged to ten-year lows, casting greater doubt over its plans to be
taken over in a rescue bid by smaller rival DYNEGY.

Three EUROPEAN STEEL MAKERS, Aceralia, Arbed and Usinor, patched up
differences that had threatened their plans to merge, by agreeing to
reduce Usinor's stake in the combined entity. The new company will be
the world's biggest steel maker.

OPTIMISM AT LAST

The DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE has climbed by nearly 20% above its
lows on September 21st, leading some optimists to announce the
emergence of a new bull market. The index came within 23 points of the
10,000 mark before falling back.

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34884_6659355_1_79944192_60299072_1_6e

Brand names got a boost in Europe. The European Court of Justice handed
a victory to jeans maker LEVI STRAUSS when it ruled that sales of
so-called "parallel imports" from outside the European Union's
jurisdiction were allowed only with the consent of the trademark owner.
The decision ends Levi's three-year battle with Tesco, a British
supermarket chain, that sold cut-price Levi's jeans imported from the
United States.

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34883_6659355_1_79944192_60299072_1_6d

American INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION fell for the 13th straight month, the
longest continuous decline since the second world war. Other indicators
were more optimistic: the Conference Board's index of leading
indicators rose by 0.3% in October, raising hopes that the widely
expected recession might not last long.

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34887_6659355_1_79944192_60299072_1_71

SCHMIDTBANK, a 170-year-old family-owned German bank, was rescued from
some decidedly modern investments by a consortium of bigger peers,
including Deutsche Bank, HVB Group, Commerzbank and Dresdner Bank.
Schmidtbank has racked up losses from Consors, an online broker, as
well as from bad loans to Germany's MITTELSTAND companies.

FRENCH CONNECTIONS

Shares in BULL, the troubled French computer company, shot up when its
chairman, Guy de Panafieu, resigned. The French government pledged
EURO100m ($88m) to the company, though the European Commission, which
is strongly opposed to state subsidies, may yet raise objections to the
plan.

The chief of BARCLAYS' French operations was questioned by magistrates
in Paris as part of an investigation into alleged money laundering
between France and Israel. Other banks under scrutiny include BRED, and
Societe Marseillaise de Credit, owned by HSBC.

The European Commission levied a EURO855m ($750) fine, the largest in
its history, against ROCHE and BASF, and six other companies, for
price-fixing in the market for vitamins. Two years ago, both companies
were fined by antitrust regulators in America, and a Roche executive
was jailed for four months.

PERCY BARNEVIK, the Swedish businessman who more or less created ABB,
the Swiss-Swedish engineering giant, is to step down as non-executive
chairman. Mr Barnevik said his departure would give the company's new
management team a clear mandate of their own.

LOVE BOATS

ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES and P&O PRINCESS CRUISES, respectively the
world's second- and third-largest cruise lines, agreed to merge in a
bid to ride out the global economic storm. The deal may frustrate the
ambitions of CARNIVAL CRUISE LINES, the industry leader, which has made
previous overtures to P&O Princess in a failed attempt to expand
its European operations.

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34886_6659355_1_79944192_60299072_1_70

KPN, the Dutch telecoms company, said it would issue EURO5 billion
($4.4 billion ) in shares at a 50% discount to the current price, to
help it reduce a massive debt load acquired to purchase
third-generation mobile-phone licences.

A slump in demand has cost jobs at ALCOA, the world's largest aluminium
producer, which announced plans to sack 6,500 workers around the world.
The company is forecasting a 4.7% drop in aluminium demand this year,
the worst in 20 years.

  Dear Investor,   If there ever was a time you needed a plan, this is it.   [IMAGE] It's not enough to simply buy beaten down stocks that look like great values.  Buy indiscriminately now...and you're likely to wake up one morning, turn on the tube, and discover your stock's price down another 20%.  All because your stock "missed its earnings" again -- and you missed out on better opportunities once more.   In the 2nd quarter 800 companies pre-warned of bad results.  Earnings plunged 67% as a whole according to The Wall Street Journal.  And third quarter results were just as dismal -- with overall earnings sinking like a rock again.  Yet the companies my clients and I own  are doing BETTER THAN EVER!   As you'll see shortly, we've survived the worst bear market of the last twenty-five years...and enjoyed nice gains along the way, as well.  Now you can, too.  How?    I'll sum up our plan in two simple words.  The only companies we own are...

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

At my Technology Investing advisory, we reap HUGE
GAINS from the opportunities other investors miss.

OUR SECRET WEAPON?  A laser-like focus on All-Tech,
All-the-Time.  You see, most investment advisors pride
themselves on a broad reach across dozens of industries.
They claim that gives you more opportunities to profit.

But that's JUST BALONEY.  There's no way one
individual -- or even a substantial team -- can spread
himself that thin and still do quality research...especially
when it comes to the complex world of high tech.

That's why my team and I do ONE THING, and one thing only.
We target the hottest growth markets of technology -- from
microchips to software to biotech.  And we reap the profits
 most investors miss.

DID YOU OWN Immunex, for example?

I'm sure by now you've heard of Amgen's buyout of this
fast-growing biotech firm.  When that deal was announced
yesterday, it included a 17% premium for our Immunex stock.
But our profits -- locked in after I advised clients to
sell in an urgent email bulletin -- were much higher than
that.  We banked 105% GAINS in just 8-months' time.

I hope you owned Immunex.  But if you didn't, don't worry
about it.  In just a moment I'll tell you all about my c
urrent #1 PICK -- another overlooked stock that should
DOUBLE YOUR MONEY at least in 2002....then multiply it
5-times over by 2007.

BUT FIRST, an important lesson to be learned from Immunex.
Don't believe everything you hear on Wall Street.

Back when we bought Immunex, traders were down on almost
everything related to the drug industry.  And I agreed with
them -- to a point.  You see, the big drug companies are
facing intense pressure from generic drug-makers.  Merck's
big disappointment is a perfect example -- 0% earnings growth
next year.  That's pitiful in today's drug hungry world.

But as the baby boomers pass into their "golden years,"
drugs are still a HUGE PLAY.  just not in the traditional
way.  Most big pharma companies -- like Merck, Pfizer and
J&J -- have really slipped when it comes to new drug
development.

But INNOVATIVE biotechs like Immunex are a totally different
story.  Their R&D is RED-HOT.  So when Wall Street tarred
the traditional firms and biotechs with the same brush...we
stepped in to pick Immunex up for a song.

Eight months later, we're 105% RICHER.  Now, we're about to
pull off another profit coup just like it -- but with MUCH
BIGGER potential.  And this time around, YOU have the
opportunity to join us.

Here's the truth about today's so-called communications
"fiber glut" that everyone keeps talking about:

WHEN the World Trade Center got hit, the Internet slowed
down -- very noticeably slowed down.  In fact, it nearly
came to a grinding halt!  That means there isn't nearly
enough capacity or redundancy built into the system to
accommodate a blip in demand.

Sources tell me that the government is very worried about
this problem.  After all, this is the second time it's
happened.  Back in July, a tunnel fire in Baltimore slowed
the Internet to a crawl for two full days.

That means our communications systems -- and therefore our
economy -- are very, very vulnerable.

Ten years ago, it wouldn't have mattered.  But today,
commerce and security is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on those
systems.  Virtually nothing moves without it.  That's how
banks and brokerages transfer funds...how dispatchers route
fleets of trucks...how many Americans get paid through
direct deposit.

And we are closer to the BREAKING POINT than 99.9% of
Americans even begin to understand.  Here's one example.

Qwest -- one of America's biggest carriers -- recently said
they're 60% loaded on their network.  That doesn't sound
too bad...until you understand how these networks operate.
You can't load a network much past 65%.  In fact, 70% is
virtually CATASTROPHIC -- because the network spends so
much time searching for open channels, it doesn't spend any
time actually sending packets of information.

The system locks.  Communications stops.  The nation comes
to a standstill.

AMERICA IS FALLING BEHIND the rest of the developed world.
Internet traffic systems currently run faster in Australia,
Europe and even South America.  That's because we push out
more data than everyone else -- but we're not increasing
capacity at anywhere near the needed rate.

We've got to catch up -- and we've got to catch up fast!
Otherwise business, the economy and our national security
all go in the CRAPPER.

BUT WHY do we have this capacity problem amidst a "fiber glut?"
Because  95% of all the fiber that has ever been laid is
"dark" -- that is, it's not activated.  And the company I'm
recommending is the #1 supplier of the components needed to do
the job.  I'm looking at a DOUBLE -- possibly a TRIPLE by
this time next year.  And I fully expect to multiply our money
five-times over by 2007.  In fact, this stock truly has
"ten-bagger" potential!

At the height of the boom, this company's stock was nearly
20-times higher.  So what changed?  Spending on communications
networks dried up.  Now the government is ready to pump
$100 billion in emergency spending into the economy; interest
rates are practically zero; and the need isn't just vital
for the economy anymore -- it's a question of NATIONAL
SECURITY!

Please don't miss out.  You'll kick yourself big-time if you
do. Get this company's name -- and full details -- in my
urgent profit bulletin: 5-Times Richer By 2007.  It's yours
FREE, simply for accepting a 100% RISK-FREE trial subscription
to my Technology Investing advisory.

TAKE a full six months to measure the value of my advice for
yourself.  Don't like what you see...don't make the profits
you want, just cancel, and your subscription doesn't cost
you a dime.   That's reason enough to give it a try.  Because
if I'm right -- and I'm staking my reputation and my own money
on this call -- you can double your money, at least, in 12
months...and make your fortune several times over in the
coming years.

Please don't miss out.  Give yourself a chance.  At least take
a look at Technology Investing to see what you think.  Our
unusual six-month guarantee of total satisfaction means my
advisory costs you nothing if you don't 100% approve.

Technology Investing

P.S.  The longer you wait, the more profits you MISS OUT on.
This stock has a long ways to run -- but it's already UP 41%
since October 1st, in recognition of this company's vital new
role in national security.

Dark fiber does no good.  Actual carrying capacity is strained
to the limits.  And get this --- data traffic is DOUBLING every
year now.  That means a network running at 63% of capacity needs
to double its load by this time next year just to keep up.
That's why the fiber must be lit.  That's why the fiber will be
lit.  Click here to take advantage of this opportunity now.

Gentlemen,

I have contacted the DBAs and indicated your displeasure of not being informed of the proposed EnPower down-time.  They should be contacting you shortly.  However, let me ensure you that there will be no down time without your approval.  Attached is the email that I sent in response to Bill's call earlier this afternoon.  Don, I have included you in this email to keep Real-Time East "in the loop".

 

Regards,
Will

DBAs,

What exactly are your plans for this maintenance window?  I have just receive a very stern call from our Bill Williams (head of the West Desk real-time traders) whom is concerned that his team will be unable to function for 8 hours for days in a row.  He indicated that the database being down for that period of time is unacceptable.  Our real-time users work 24-7 and must meet schedules every hour.

Bill also asked that we keep the real-time desk in the loop for any potential down time.
Please include the following people on your distribution list regarding database maintenance windows.
Don Baughman (head of Real-Time East)
Bill Williams III (head of Real-Time West)
Michael Tully (IT Portland)

All scheduled down-times must be approved by both Don Baughman and Bill Williams.  This would indicate that we need to plan in advance in all cases so that they have time to approve.

Please distribute a new email discussing in more detail the state of the database during the maintenance window.

Thanks,
Will

The DBAs would like some downtime this weekend to re-build some objects that are overly-fragmented.  If we can give them 2 - 4 different 6 - 12 hour windows, they will re-build as much as they can.

Can we get together briefly this morning to determine when we could allow some downtime?  The DBAs would like to know by about 2:00 this afternoon.

Thanks, d.n.

Best of the Web Today - December 19, 2001
By JAMES TARANTO
On the Run  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61676-2001Dec18.html

Anti-Taliban Eastern Alliance officials say "hundreds of al Qaeda members and their families--possibly including some top commanders--escaped the U.S. onslaught at Tora Bora and reached Pakistan with the help of senior Afghan tribal leaders," the Associated Press reports. The Afghans also say Pakistani authorities are protecting senior Taliban officials, but "Pakistan called both allegations nonsense."

In Pakistan, meanwhile, al Qaeda prisoners staged a riot, the London  Daily Telegraph  http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/12/19/uwar.xml&sSheet=/portal/2001/12/19/ixport.html  reports:

*** QUOTE ***

156 al-Qa'eda captives were being moved from Parachinar, a town near the Afghan border. A group of them shouted "Allahu Akbar" (God is great) and grabbed the soldiers' weapons.

More than 40 of them fled in prison vans. Six were captured soon afterwards although the remainder are still at large. Most of them were Arabs who had earlier escaped from a detention centre in eastern Afghanistan. They had fled the US air bombardment of the Tora Bora mountains and were captured by Pakistani border patrols.

*** END QUOTE ***

A  BBC report  http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/south_asia/newsid_1719000/1719223.stm  has a casualty count of "at least six men dead on each side."

Where's Osama? Who Nose?  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/12/18/MN121077.DTL

Still no word on Osama bin Laden's whereabouts, but some interesting rumors are starting to circulate. The San Francisco Chronicle scoffs at claims that bin Laden has had plastic surgery to alter his appearance, than turns around and interviews a bunch of plastic surgeons on the plausibility of giving the Muslim maniac a nose job:

*** QUOTE ***

"It's do-able," said Daniel Morello, former president of the American Society For Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. . . . Before brandishing a scalpel, Morello would laser off bin Laden's bushy beard, eliminating evidence of hair follicles, cut his hair (if he has any under that omnipresent white turban) and pluck his thick eyebrows.

"The second we alter the eyebrows, we alter his appearance," said Morello, who would also straighten out bin Laden's "heavy-lidded" eyes and perform a lip reduction to thin his "very full" lower lip.

To create more profound change, Morello took aim at bin Laden's nose. "His nose is very prominent, with wide nostrils and a plunging tip," he said. "I would give him a more nondescript nose, tip up, nostrils in--a nose that's more uniform in width."

*** END QUOTE ***

Meanwhile, Boston's  WBUR  http://www.wbur.org/special/specialcoverage/feature_aljaz.asp  reports that Al Jazeera reports that the Pakistani daily Jang reports that "Osama Bin Laden secretly left Afghanistan and arrived in Iran, where an ethnic group, which is opposing the Iranian Government, provided him shelter."

Omar's Still Hanging Around   http://www.guardian.co.uk/afghanistan/story/0,1284,620349,00.html

London's Guardian reports that "Afghan forces have tracked down the Taliban's supreme leader to a mountain redoubt in southern Afghanistan and will lynch him after wiping out his diehard followers, an intelligence chief said." Mullah Mohammad Omar was reportedly betrayed by some of his lieutenants, who were seeking better treatment from anti-Taliban forces.

What's Next?  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20011219/ts/nato_somalia_1.html

A "senior German official" tells the Associated Press that, in the AP's words, "the United States has decided to take its fight against Osama bin Laden's terror network to Somalia. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was no longer a question of whether to go after al-Qaida terrorists in the east African nation, but only when and how."

Knight Ridder  http://web.realcities.com/content/rc/news/attack/miami/1956720407.htm  reports the heat may be off Saddam Hussein--for the moment. "Officials and diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Bush's top advisers are nearing a consensus that there is insufficient international backing for a war in Iraq and uncertain prospects of military success." Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, the administration's leading advocate of taking on Saddam, tells Knight Ridder that America plans to target "places where we think senior al-Qaida might be trying to escape to or those places where we have tentatively identified possible al-Qaida people hanging out"--which likely means countries like Somalia, Yemen and Sudan.

But an article in  Slate  http://slate.msn.com//?id=2059873  suggests an attack on Iraq may be in the offing, even if not immediately. The Webzine's Inigo Thomas notes that the Paul Mikolashek, head of the U.S. Third Army, was recently sent to Camp Doha, a U.S. base in Kuwait. Thomas cites an article in  Jane's  http://www.janes.com/regional_news/africa_middle_east/news/jmb/jmb011212_1_n.shtml , which notes that the "Third Army's mission during the war was to close with and destroy Iraq's Republican Guard." Concludes Thomas: "A decision to topple Saddam Hussein may not have been made, but if the destruction of Iraq's best troops must be part of this mission, as seems very likely, then the 3rd Army would presumably be reassigned to the task it began in Kuwait and southern Iraq just over a decade ago. Why mess with success?"

Pakistani Grenades  http://www.hindustantimes.com/nonfram/191201/dlnat31.asp

Indian police have found markings from Wah Nobel Industries, a Pakistani subsidiary of a Swedish company, on grenades used in last week's terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament, the Hindustan Times reports. All five terrorists were Pakistani nationals.

The  Times of India  http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow.asp?art_id=767291005  reports that ties between India and America are "under strain" in the wake of the attack:

*** QUOTE ***

The theme of "your terrorism-our terrorism" has resurfaced again this week after Washington has declined to endorse New Delhi's charges of official Pakistani complicity in the terrorist attack on its democratic epicenter. Instead, in remarks Indian officials and supporters have found galling, the Bush administration is advising India to work with Pakistan in addressing the terrorism issue.

*** END QUOTE ***

Does Osama Do Windows?   http://www.elcom.co.uk/news_story.asp?id=829

A suspected al Qaeda member "claimed that Islamic militants infiltrated Microsoft and sabotaged the company's Windows XP operating system," the Washington Post's Newsbytes News Network reports, citing Indian police. Mohammad Afroze Abdul Razzak "claimed that a member or members of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network, posing as computer programmers, were able to gain employment at Microsoft and attempted to plant 'trojans, trapdoors, and bugs in Windows XP,' according to Ravi Visvesvaraya Prasad, a New Delhi information systems and telecommunication consultant." A Microsoft spokesman says Afroze's claims are "bizarre and unsubstantiated and should be treated skeptically."

Andrew Stephens's Jewish Problem  http://www.consider.net/forum_new.php3?newTemplate=OpenObject&newTop=200112170010&newDisplayURN=200112170010

In Britain's left-wing New Statesman, Andrew Stephens hints at sinister goings-on in Washington:

*** QUOTE ***

In the enforced but highly contrived multi-culturalism of our era, there was a first in the White House on 10 December: President Bush lit a Hanukkah candle to mark the second day of the minor, non-biblical Jewish festival that now competes with Christmas in all politically correct circles. Though Jews comprise no more than 2 per cent of the US population--there are probably more Muslims, though the statistics are unreliable--Hanukkah is now seen as an event that the US president must officially recognise and celebrate.

His spokesman, Ari Fleischer, is Jewish and a couple of weeks ago put his spin on how the White House expected Yasser Arafat to behave in the light of the attacks on Jerusalem and Palestine; the most hawkish member of the Bush administration, the deputy defence secretary, Paul Wolfowitz, is also Jewish and vociferously argues for war on Iraq. But I have never seen these facts mentioned in the media here, as it would be considered unacceptable to do so. But how long will it be, I wonder, before any of the several million US Muslims are similarly assimilated into such trusted positions in US society?

*** END QUOTE ***

Arafat's Trade  http://www.jpost.com/Editions/2001/12/19/News/News.40203.html

The Saudis may have been too hasty in accusing Yasser Arafat of surrendering. The Jerusalem Post reports the Palestinian Authority chief delivered a "fiery address in Ramallah yesterday, during which he said he is willing to sacrifice 70 martyrs for one dead Israeli." An Arafat adviser claims the speech was mistranslated.

The Post  also reports  http://www.jpost.com/Editions/2001/12/19/News/News.40205.html  that "the terrorist who planted the roadside bomb detonated near a convoy carrying Chief of General Staff Lt.-Gen. Shaul Mofaz near Hebron last month was a former member Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat's elite presidential guard who trained to fight terror in the US."

A Rowdy Saudi  http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/orl-princessbond12182001.story

Saudi Princess Buniah al-Saud, a niece of King Fahd, was arrested in Orlando, Fla., for allegedly beating her Indonesian maid and pushing her down a flight of stairs. Charged with felony aggravated battery, the princess could spend up to 15 years in prison. Those great humanitarians at the Saudi Embassy in Washington "said the princess had diplomatic immunity. But the Immigration and Naturalization Service said al-Saud failed to follow proper procedures by not notifying them of her itinerary in America, thereby leaving her without immunity."

Kabul's Lost Women  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A62604-2001Dec18.html

"Taliban soldiers abducted many women and girls, perhaps hundreds or more, during their five-year rule of Afghanistan," according to a chilling report in the Washington Post. "It is impossible to calculate the number kidnapped. Many families have never spoken out because of the stigma, especially strong in this conservative Muslim society, of having a daughter or sister sold for sex. Others fear that protesting could jeopardize the life of their missing loved ones."

Meanwhile, a deep thinker named  Mark Mathabane  http://www.usatoday.com/news/comment/2001-12-19-ncguest2.htm , "director of multicultural studies" at the  Catlin Gable School  http://www.catlin.edu/  in Portland, Ore., pens an op-ed piece for USA Today in which he reveals that some American parents are "like the Taliban." Do they sell their daughters into slavery? No, it turns out these parents "anoint themselves as thought and morality police" by trying to influence which books appear in public school libraries and on class reading lists. Oh, the humanity!

The Sky Is Falling!  http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2001/12/18/eguillermo.DTL

A civil-liberties Chicken Little called Emil Guillermo tells what's supposed to be a harrowing story of the new police state. Glenn Reynolds of  InstaPundit.com  http://instapundit.blogspot.com/2001_12_16_instapundit_archive.html#8034732  summarizes it nicely:

*** QUOTE ***

Here's his tale of fascist brutality and horror: a man talked loudly and rudely against the war and George Bush, and seemed supportive of terrorists. Some FBI agents knocked on his door. They told him he had the right to free speech. He told them to go away. They did.

*** END QUOTE ***

Up in Ottawa, meanwhile, civil libertarians staged an oh-so-clever protest against Canada's proposed antiterror laws.  Reuters  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/nm/20011218/od/santa_dc_1.html  reports:

*** QUOTE ***

Canadian police, taking advantage of sweeping new anti-terrorism legislation, arrested Santa Claus on the grounds that he had a beard, was behaving suspiciously and, in all likelihood, belonged to a underground cell. Or so demonstrators would have you believe.

The "arrest" Monday was stage-managed by local pro-democracy activists who say that the legislation . . . will destroy many civil liberties.

*** END QUOTE ***

Oh, isn't that just darling? But in at least one Canadian province, Christmas was banned years ago--for reasons of "multiculturalism." The  National Post  http://www.nationalpost.com/home/story.html?f=/stories/20011215/879050.html  reports Gary Doer, the premier of Manitoba, "has decided to reverse a trend begun in the 1980s that has seen the elimination of references to Christ and the Christian holiday at the legislature. The decorated spruce tree that sits in the assembly's rotunda has been officially called the multicultural tree since 1990. The legislature has not officially used the word Christmas since 1996."

'Others May Disagree'  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A62924-2001Dec18.html

Michael Kelly has some fun at the expense of a confused young lady named Alison Hornstein, a Yale student, who wrote a column for Newsweek:

*** QUOTE ***

At some point soon after Sept. 11, listening to Yale students and professors offer rationalizations for the mass murders (poverty in the Middle East, U.S. foreign policy, etc.) Hornstein had an epiphany. Some things were just wrong. "Just as we should pass absolute moral judgment in the case of rape, we should recognize that some actions are objectively bad, despite differences in cultural standards and values. To me, hijacking planes and killing thousands of civilians falls into this category."

Hurrah! A breakthrough! A moral judgment! Yes, Ms. Hornstein, murdering thousands of people in fact is bad. But wait. A lifetime of instruction is not sloughed off quite so easily as all that; Hornstein's bold moral judgment is not quite so bold as all that. Look at her conclusion again: "To me," it begins. To me. Hijacking planes and killing thousands is not objectively bad after all. It is objectively bad only in Hornstein's opinion. Indeed, she rushes to reassure on this point: "Others may disagree." Others may disagree. And she adds: "It is less important to me where people choose to draw the line than it is that they are willing to draw it at all." Oh, dear. . . .

Ms. Hornstein, push on. Go the last mile. Go out on the limb of judgment. Mass murder is indeed objectively bad--and not just in your opinion. Others may disagree--but they are wrong. Indeed, they are (shut the door for this part, lest the hall monitors catch us) morally wrong. . . . Draw the line, Ms. Hornstein. Draw it where you know it belongs. Dare to judge.

Islam's Bertrand Russell  http://www.prospect.org/print/V12/22/mooney-c.html
 
The American Prospect profiles "Ibn Warraq," pseudonymous author of the 1995 book "Why I Am Not a Muslim":

*** QUOTE ***

A dense treatise modeled after Bertrand Russell's famous 1927 essay "Why I Am Not a Christian," the work presents a strident historical, moral, and philosophical indictment of Islam and advocates not just a firm separation of mosque and state but outright atheism.

*** END QUOTE ***

The Prospect's Chris Mooney observes that the book has drawn favorable attention on the political right, from, among others, Daniel Pipes and WorldNetDaily.com. The American left, however, is "confused or afraid":

*** QUOTE ***

Warraq contends that because of the work of Edward Said and other theorists, the American left has "been scared of being called colonialists and imperialists" and so has adopted a guilt-ridden shyness about Islam. Yet liberals in other Western countries have been more open to his views: Warraq has recently contributed a commentary to the left-leaning British newspaper The Guardian; in October, Australia's Radio National devoted an entire Religion Report program to interviewing him. As one Islamic historian put it, "At least until September 11, the place where it was the most difficult to criticize Islam was in America."

Steve Decker, a social-studies teacher at Kansas' Wellsville High School, has been suspended without pay for 60 days. His crime? He had a disassembled hunting rifle, in a case, under the seat of his locked pickup truck, which was parked in the school parking lot. "A search dog hired by the school nosed down" the gun, the Lawrence Journal-World reports, and Decker was suspended under a Kansas law prohibiting firearms on school property.

Trojan Horse  http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,41138,00.html

In Massachusetts, "proponents of two different ballot referendums are trading barbs over allegations that voters who signed a petition supporting one ballot question were duped into signing the other," the Associated Press reports. The same company was collecting signatures for Petition A, which would ban the slaughter of horses for human food, and Petition E, which "would define marriage as a union between one man and one woman."

Hey, why not just combine the two measures and define marriage as a union between a man and his horse? We suspect even Bay State denizens would vote "neigh," but you have to admit, such marriages would at least be stable.

Dear Investor,

I'm writing to expose the biggest lie in technology
today...

...one that has individual investors completely in the
dark about an opportunity of immense proportions.  A
LOW-RISK tech stock that can easily DOUBLE your money
by this time next year -- then make your fortune
several times over in the years to come.

I've just put the finishing touches on an Urgent
Profit Bulletin detailing this opportunity
and in just a bit, I'll tell you how to get your
FREE copy.

But first, back to technology's biggest lie.  I'm
talking about the so-called "glut" of fiber optic
cable.  Here's the REAL story:

WHEN the World Trade Center got hit, the Internet
slowed down -- very noticeably slowed down.  In fact,
it nearly came to a grinding halt!  That means there
isn't nearly enough capacity or redundancy built into
the system to accommodate a blip in demand.

Sources tell me that the government is very worried
about this problem.  After all, this is the second
time it's happened.  Back in July, a tunnel fire in
Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl for two full
days.

That means our communications systems -- and therefore
our economy -- are very, very vulnerable.

Ten years ago, it wouldn't have mattered.  But today,
commerce and security is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on those
systems.  Virtually nothing moves without it.  That's
how banks and brokerages transfer funds...how
dispatchers route fleets of trucks...how many Americans
get paid through direct deposit.

And we are closer to the BREAKING POINT than 99.9% of
Americans even begin to understand.  Here's one
example.

Qwest -- one of America's biggest carriers -- recently
said they're 60% loaded on their network.  That
doesn't sound too bad...until you understand how these
networks operate.  You can't load a network much past
65%.  In fact, 70% is virtually CATASTROPHIC --
because the network spends so much time searching for
open channels, it doesn't spend any time actually
sending packets of information.

The system locks.  Communications stops.  The nation
comes to a standstill.

AMERICA IS FALLING BEHIND the rest of the developed
world.  Internet traffic systems currently run faster
in Australia, Europe and even South America.  That's
because we push out more data than everyone else --
but we're not increasing capacity at anywhere near the
needed rate.

We've got to catch up -- and we've got to catch up
fast!  Otherwise business, the economy and our
national security all go in the CRAPPER.

BUT WHY do we have this capacity problem amidst a
"fiber glut?"  Because  95% of all the fiber that has
ever been laid is "dark" -- that is, it's not
activated.  And the company I'm recommending is the #1
supplier of the components needed to do the job.  I'm
looking at a DOUBLE -- possibly a TRIPLE by this time
next year.  And I fully expect to multiply our money
five-times over by 2007.  In fact, this stock truly
has "ten-bagger" potential!

At the height of the boom, this company's stock was
nearly 20-times higher.  So what changed?  Spending on
communications networks dried up.  Now the government
is ready to pump $100 billion in emergency spending
into the economy; interest rates are practically zero;
and the need isn't just vital for the economy anymore
-- it's a question of NATIONAL SECURITY!

Please don't miss out.  You'll kick yourself big-time
if you miss out. Get this company's name -- and full
details -- in my urgent profit bulletin: 5-Times
Richer By 2007.  It's yours FREE, simply for accepting
a 100% RISK-FREE trial subscription to my TECHNOLOGY
INVESTING advisory.

TAKE a full six months to measure the value of my
advice for yourself.  Don't like what you see...don't
make the profits you want, just cancel, and your
subscription doesn't cost you a dime.   That's reason
enough to give it a try.  Because if I'm right -- and
I'm staking my reputation and my own money on this
call -- you can double your money, at least, in 12
months...and make your fortune several times over in the
coming years.

Please don't miss out.  Give yourself a chance.  At
least take a look at TECHNOLOGY INVESTING to see what
you think.  Our unusual six-month guarantee of total
satisfaction means my advisory costs you nothing if
you don't 100% approve.

Sincerely,

Michael Murphy
TECHNOLOGY INVESTING

P.S.  The longer you wait, the more profits you MISS
OUT on.  This stock has a long ways to run -- but it's
already UP 43% since October 1st, in recognition of
this company's vital new role in national security.

Dark fiber does no good.  Actual carrying capacity is
strained to the limits.  And get this -- data traffic is
DOUBLING every year now.  That means a network
running at 63% of capacity needs to double its load by
this time next year just to keep up.  That's why the
fiber must be lit.  That's why the fiber will be lit.
Click here to take advantage of this opportunity now.

Best of the Web Today - November 23, 2001
By JAMES TARANTO
Our Friends the Pakistanis  http://rediff.com/us/2001/nov/23ny8.htm

A series of reports from the Indian press reminds us of the degree to which America's Pakistani allies may have been culpable in the attacks of Sept. 11. The Indo-Asian News Service quotes an Indian intelligence official: "According to reports based on information from the Northern Alliance, up to 300 Pakistan Army regulars could be holed up in Kunduz. There are reports that Pakistani officers of the rank of colonel are still in Kunduz," the last Taliban stronghold in northern Afghanistan.

Earlier, the Press Trust of India reported that  a pair of Pakistani helicopters  http://www.rediff.com/us/2001/nov/22ny7.htm  had evacuated a group of Pakistani military officers, including two brigadiers, from Kunduz. Indian intelligence officials "said these forces were part of Pakistani army units, seconded to Taleban ranks for command and control operations," PTI reports, adding:

*** QUOTE ***

Defence experts in Delhi wondered how Pakistani choppers could have entered Afghan air space and landed in Kunduz with the US Air Force having tight control over the Afghan skies.

They said the operation could not have been carried out without a nod from the US.

"It has to be done with US connivance and, therefore, poses vital questions about America's aims and objectives," they added.

*** END QUOTE ***

According to another PTI report,  the country formerly known as Burma  http://rediff.com/news/2001/nov/23pak.htm  has "granted sanctuary to two Pakistani nuclear scientists following a request from Islamabad." The scientists, Suleiman Asad and Mohammad Ali Mukhtar, helped develop Pakistan's nuclear-weapons program and are suspected of having ties to the al Qaeda terrorist organization. Islamabad assured authorities in TCFKAB "that the duo were not involved in any terrorist activity," PTI reports.

All this bolsters our  Tunku Varadarajan  http://opinionjournal.com/columnists/tvaradarajan/?id=95001492 's observation that it would be a mistake for America to view Pakistan's dictator, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, as a true friend. He is, rather, an ally of convenience, doing Washington's bidding lest he be destroyed. At least Musharraf is smart enough to know which way the wind is blowing: The Associated Press reports Pakistan has  closed the Taliban's embassy in Islamabad  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20011123/ts/pakistan_goodbye_taliban.html , and the IANS adds that Pakistan "is planning to open a mission in the eastern Afghanistan city of Jalalabad in a virtual recognition of the Northern Alliance."

Our Friends the Spanish  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/nm/20011122/ts/attack_spain_extradition_dc_1.html

Spain may refuse to extradite eight suspected al Qaeda members to America, because America has the death penalty. Spain has been a democracy for barely a quarter century after more than three decades of military dictatorship, but its leaders are imbued with such a sense of moral superiority that they feel free to dictate domestic policy to the United States. Does anyone know the Spanish word for "chutzpah"?

Somali Internet Shut Down  http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africa/newsid_1672000/1672220.stm

Somalia's only Internet service provider, the Somalia Internet Co., has been forced to shut down after appearing on the U.S. list of terrorist sponsors, the BBC reports. Barkaat, a Somali telecom company, has also been shut. Seems to us the Beeb buried the lead, though. The real news here is that Somalia even had Internet access.

Unforgettable  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A2246-2001Nov22.html

Have the Taliban been taking advice from Bill Clinton's old spin doctors? The Associated Press reports from Spinboldak, Afghanistan, that "a Taliban spokesman said the world should move on and forget about the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States." Here's the quote, from Syed Tayyab Agha: "You should forget the Sept. 11 attacks because now there is a new fighting against Muslims and Islam, and the international and global terrorists like America and Britain, they are killing daily our innocent people."

In response, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz says: "We are moving on, and I think before long the world will forget about the Taliban."

The Taliban have got to be the most ridiculous bunch of barbarians the world has seen in a long time. Last week, recall, top Talib Mullah Mohammad Omar  vowed to destroy the U.S.  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001470 , then said he'd  leave Kandahar  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001486 . This week he decided to stay put because of a  "prophetic dream."  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001494  Now his underlings want us to "forget" an unforgettable atrocity. What can one do but laugh?

Even Sept. 11 is hardly evidence of the Taliban's fearsomeness. After all, the Taliban didn't blow up the World Trade Center; they merely rented out their country to the terrorists who did. That's enough to justify destroying the Taliban, but not enough to justify taking them seriously.

'Zoo Time'  http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,2001530005-2001541922,00.html

The Times of London reports on the Taliban's treatment of the eight international aid workers they kidnapped:

*** QUOTE ***

Cruel games with a gun, maggoty food and regular parades of the women before their guards were part of life behind bars for the captives.

The women prisoners were a source of fascination for the jailers and their commanders. Every evening members of the Taleban Foreign Ministry, accompanied by a clutch of bearded strangers, would visit the cells and demand that the women stand by the bars. Wordlessly, they would stare at the women from head to toe. The prisoners--who were never touched or abused--called the session "zoo time".

The youngest of the German prisoners, Kati Jellinek, 29, was blonde and of particular interest to the Taleban. When she was arrested, five men with Kalashnikovs demanded that she pack, unpack and repack her underwear.

*** END QUOTE ***

Meanwhile, the  Associated Press  http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/central/11/20/gen.kabul.zoo.ap/index.html  reports Afghans don't treat actual zoo animals much better. Marijan, the lion at the Kabul zoo, has only one eye (just like Mullah Omar). Here's how it happened:

*** QUOTE ***

During the roaring '90s, after the Russians left, an Afghan guerrilla showing off for his friends jumped over the guard rail into the den and teased the lion. Marjan ate him.

The next day, the guerrilla's brother applied the Afghans' strict code of revenge. He tossed a hand grenade at the lion. Marjan, expecting food, pounced on it.

The blast put out his eye and nearly killed him.

On another black day, a different Afghan guerrilla amused himself by firing a rocket-propelled grenade at the elephant.

*** END QUOTE ***

No word whether the Taliban asked the elephant to forget about that indignity.

Nothing to Fear but Fear Itself  http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/11/23/war23.xml&sSheet=/portal/2001/11/23/ixport.html

The headline of a London Telegraph piece on the standoff in Kunduz proclaims: "US Fears Massacre of Foreign Fighters." Sure we do. About as much as the foreign fighters feared a massacre of U.S. civilians back in September.

An Enemy Surrenders  http://www.preventafghanwar.org/

The Web site PreventAfghanWar.org, set up to urge America to surrender to terrorism, has itself surrendered:

*** QUOTE ***

This web site was intended as a place to gather and focus the opinions of American [sic] who believe that going to war with Afghanistan, in an action like Desert Storm, is not the way for the United States to respond to the destruction of the World Trade Center and the other terrorists [sic] acts of September 11, 2001.

On October 8 the military action began. Then it was not clear if this is an American verses [sic] Afghanistan war or has evolved into a coalition of countries against terrorists based in Afghanistan. The situation changed significantly by November 14, 2001.

Events have seemed to render the purpose of this web site moot. War and now the displacement of the Afghanistan government by the Northern Aliance [sic] is becoming a fact. Therefore this web site is being taken down, at least for the time being.

*** END QUOTE ***

Our Friends the Oregonians  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/21/national/21PORT.html

We  noted on Wednesday  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001498#portland  that the Portland, Ore., police department is refusing to cooperate with the U.S. Justice Department's efforts to investigate terrorism. An article in the New York Times (link requires registration) offers a clue as to the motivations of Portland's acting police chief, Andrew Kirkland:

*** QUOTE ***

Mr. Kirkland, who is black, said his own background had also played a role in his decision. "I grew up in Detroit," he said, "and I hated the police with a passion. They were always stopping and bothering me."

*** END QUOTE ***

What kind of city would put someone who hates the police in charge of its police department? What's next, a commander in chief who loathes the military?

Stupidity Watch  http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4303746,00.html

One Humera Khan offers the following pearl of wisdom in London's Guardian:

*** QUOTE ***

While the Taliban were imposing their beliefs and reducing freedom on one side, the same can be said of the male-dominated and often misogynistic fashion industry on the other. The question of which is the more ruthless form of persuasion, the lashes of the Taliban or the multimillion-pound advertising flashes of the fashion industry, remains a moot point.

*** END QUOTE ***

'Extremist Relations'   http://www.time.com/time/asia/news/daily/0,9754,184955,00.html

The Asian edition of Time magazine carries a charming report on post-Taliban sexual liberation in Afghanistan. Najib, a 20-year-old Mazar-e-Sharif man, is waiting for his "one true love" to return; her family fled to Uzbekistan when the Taliban took over:

*** QUOTE ***

The pair used to meet regularly, sometimes holding hands, and once just before the Taliban came Shabnam spent the night with Najib at his home. "She wanted to have extremist relations," he explains. "But I controlled myself. I told her I was not ready. She was very upset, but then I pampered her and she began to smile again. In the end, we just embraced." He muses over Shabnam's voracious sexual appetite. "Women are very strange--you cannot understand them." When they meet, Najib says, they would just look at each other and shake hands. "Islam does not permit kissing," he pauses, "but maybe I won't be so holy one day."

*** END QUOTE ***

Less liberated are the U.S. Navy women on the USS Theodore Roosevelt, who, the  Washington Post  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A852-2001Nov21.html  reports, are complaining about a visit by six Miami Dolphins cheerleaders aimed at boosting the morale of the ship's men. "It's good for the cheerleaders to see an aircraft carrier. But it's not good for the men," gripes Shenandoah Hawkesworth. "They've been at sea for close to 65 days, and their hormones are definitely on high."

John F. Who?  http://www.interglobal.org/weblog/archives/00000155.htm

InstaPundit.com cites fellow Web logger  Rand Simberg  http://www.interglobal.org/weblog/archives/00000155.htm 's observation that, as InstaPundit puts it, yesterday "is the anniversary of JFK's assassination, and nobody seems to have noticed. He's right; I'd forgotten it myself. This seems to be of deep social significance." Actually, the  Washington Post  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A1206-2001Nov22.html  noticed, but it seems to have been alone.

The D.C. Police, Hard at Work  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64342-2001Nov21.html

The Washington Post's "District Crime Watch" column yesterday carried the following report:

*** QUOTE ***

Sixth St., 1600 block, 2:40 a.m. Nov. 5. Despite being told to stop, a man fondled a female acquaintance sleeping in a bed with him.

*** END QUOTE ***

It's good to know that even in this age of terrorism, the police in our nation's capital are as vigilant as ever about serious crime.

Good Day,

Getting rid of Lotus Notes for NetCo (or whatever we will be?):
The power scheduling group and the 24 hour Power Trading group both use the "East Power Discussion" db in Lotus Notes.

They need a bulletin board basically that they can all write to.  They will need to have the historical information from the Lotus Notes db saved into the new format(whatever that is).

 Let me know if you have any other questions.

Thanks,

Thanks for responding Dan

The Traders have Kobra, so that's what they'll use, it's been planned forever, they should be aware

Can you get me a list of the Lotus Notes apps that you're aware of?

thanks

I have read this.

Questions:
1. Do the traders know that they will not have Bridge Telerate?

2. Some trading groups use Lotus Notes for business applications.


Thanks for the update.

The fact that you have seen this document is to remain confidential do not share with anyone that is not included on this distribution list

The attached is a list of NETCo transition project assumptions/expectations and issues that are being worked in anticipation of Day 1 at NETCo. I want you to read through it so that:

you are aware of what we'll be expected to support on Day 1
you can read for issues that will directly impact your ability to support

any concerns/questions that you have should be directed back to me. Please let me know when you have completed reading, even if you don't find anything that raises concern

thanks!

P.S. "Day 1" is subjective ... means first day of business. The term "Day 2" means when NETCo is actually physically separated from Estate, not the literal 2nd day of ops

Corey:  I spoke to WorldCom this morning and they are in the process of trying to find some vanity numbers with UBS as the prefix.  Before I can order the new numbers, I need to know where to bill them.  I am having them set up a separate billing account for UBS, but I need to know who is going to be responsible for the bill.  Also, I need to know what number these toll free numbers are going to be directed to.   Are the phones already setup or is it going to be a new application?  Let me know and I'll get it going.  Thanks!

Kathy

Kathy,

We are requesting three new numbers for UBS Warburg Energy to replace the (soon to be) Enron Estate numbers.

1)  We will need two (2) toll free numbers.  
If possible, a 927 (WAR) or 827 (UBS) prefix and sequential numbers is desired.  For example, our search showed 1-866-927-1401 and 1-866-927-1402 are available.

2)  Also, we need a local number for a dedicated fax line.

Please contact TJae Black, Lloyd Will or me for any further information you may need.

Thanks,

Corry Bentley

Hey don,

1. We have a new solution for the db which will work in outlook.  They wanted to know if we will still need the historical data and they will need to check if we are allowed to take that data.  Do we need the data?  Do we still have business from that when we become UBS? 

2. Please put in an erequest for a public folder.  Goto erequest and choose applications/ms outlook/public folder...put notes that you will use to replace old "east power trading" ln db.



Let me know so I can get it done.

Hello ATW User Group!

OATS WILL BE UNAVAILABLE DECEMBER 29

Below is a message that was sent out by Alex Salpter of the EPA this
morning.  The scheduled shut down of the OATS system should be planned on so
that you don't find yourself in a last minute attempt to transfer allowances
online and not be allowed.  As mentioned below, this especially affects NOx
compliance since December 31, 2001 is the last day to transfer allowances in
NATS.  Please review and prepare.

Best Regards,
Ona Papageorgiou
ESP

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dear Clients of the On-Line Allowance Transfer System (OATS):

This to to let you know that the National Computer Center (NCC) at Research
Triangle Park, North Carolina, will be moving its location and will be shut
down between Saturday, December 29 and Monday, December 31, as follows:

-- OATS will be unavailable on Saturday, December 29.

-- The mainframe, used for submission of quarterly emission reports, will
not be available from Saturday, December 29 through Monday, December 31.

OATS should be back in operation by Monday, December 31 and the mainframe
should be back in operation by Tuesday, January 1. There is a (small)
possibility that problems may arise and delay availability.

This is especially important to Authorized Account Representatives of

Fellas:
 
Enjoyed the weekend with you all immensely.  I  think Travis and Don Jr. are my new benchmarks for late night longevity, and  Don. Sr. is my new benchmark for marksmanship from a seated position.   
 
I want to make you all aware of a new organization  that I have helped start up.  The Saltwater Conservation Association of  Texas was founded to give Texans a new conservation resource that is dedicated  solely to the coast of Texas.
 
We are a 501 (c) 3, non-profit, and we have no paid  staff.  Our goal for the next 3-5 years is to assist TPWD in their effort  to retire as many commercial shrimping licenses as possible, as Texas shrimpers  now accumulate around 80 million pounds of bycatch annually.  This bycatch  includes an incredible amount of flounder and croaker, not to mention numerous  forage fish for trout and reds.
 
We are an authorized agent of TPWD, whereby we can  solicit bids from shrimpers, purchase their license, and then hand it over to  TPWD.  The program is intended to target bay shrimping (not bait shrimping)  as the bay shrimpers drag their nets for hours on end, whereas the bait  shrimpers usually only drag for around 20 minutes or so.  To make a long  story short, the effect of thousands of chains dragging across the bays on a  daily basis is not good for the ecosystem.
 
I hope you will all consider becoming a Founding  Father.  If not, then any level of sponsorship is certainly  appreciated.  Details of our organization and sponsorship levels can be  found at our website - www.scatexas.org  -  or you can call direct at 512-392-1256.  You can join online or print an  application and mail it in.
 
Thanks for your consideration, and once again I  really enjoyed the weekend with you all.  Take care.
 
Sincerely,
 
Mark Schultz

   NEW CORPORATE PLAYER IN THE INDUSTRY AGAINST CYBER-TERRORISM   [IMAGE]  =
IMMEDIATE BUY RECOMMENDATION Initiating Research Coverage   Merilus Inc.   =
 Symbol: MERH Shares Outstanding: 13.2 million Share Price: $1.90 Market Ca=
pitalization: $25 million 52 Week Hi/Low: $8.50/$0.45 Estimated Public Floa=
t: 2 million shares  Developed over the last four years, Merilus has recent=
ly started marketing the latest and most advanced computer security product=
s targeted for small to medium businesses.   This market has been, and is p=
rojected to be, one of the fastest sectors in technology, largely unaffecte=
d by the current weakness in the market.      THE PROBLEM AND OPPORTUNITY A=
 Computer Security Institute and FBI survey showed 90% of large organizatio=
ns detected breaches into their computing systems.  74% of these organizati=
ons acknowledged financial losses.  Price Waterhouse estimated this loss to=
 be about $40 billion last year.  The estimated number of computer attacks =
doubled last year according to the Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mell=
on University.  International Data Corp. (IDC) predicts the compounded annu=
al growth rates of digital security revenues will continue at over 88% per =
year over the next 5 years.    Merilus' products target small to medium bus=
inesses, a particularly fast growing segment of the overall security market=
, which has been underserved by the major security manufacturers.  IDC esti=
mates the small to medium business percentage of the total internet securit=
y software market will increase from the current 43% to about 70% by 2004. =
In terms of dollars, this means companies with fewer than 1000 employees co=
uld spend about $7.4 billion on security in 2004.  We strongly feel Merilus=
 is focusing on the right market, at the right time.   MERILUS SOLUTIONS Me=
rilus' computer software and hardware products represent major innovations,=
 which protect against computer information theft from hackers and others b=
oth outside and within the business.  Their recently introduced FireCards a=
re the world's first network security system and firewall (controlling who =
can access what type of data) that easily inserts into the standard PCI slo=
t inside the computer. It is a computer within the computer allowing for re=
mote updating of new innovations and security measures to ensure sensitive =
data is protected as well as transmitted in a secure manner.   Industry rev=
iews have given the new products high ratings.  Secure Computing Magazine g=
ave the FireCard a five out of five star rating and The Tech Zone awarded a=
 9.5 out of 10 score.  NASA and Lockheed Martin are just a couple of the so=
phisticated organizations that have started using Merilus products.  Even t=
hough Merilus and its products are relatively new to the market place we fe=
el they will also have good acceptance because they are extremely price com=
petitive.  Management will strive to maintain its current 2:1 cost/feature =
ratio, where products are either half the price of competitors for the same=
 functionality or twice the functionality for the same price.  Manufacturin=
g of the products is contracted out to keep capital and inventory costs dow=
n and flexibility up.   THE ROLLOUT Over the summer, after rigorous testing=
 in Compaq's labs, Merilus has become a member of the Compaq Solutions Alli=
ance, allowing installation of products into Compaq computers. Merilus rece=
ntly announced they have partnered with the three largest distributors in N=
orth America: Ingram Micro, Tech Data and EMJ.  Last week Merilus announced=
 its Reseller Program, which provides marketing and technical support as we=
ll as substantial rebates to vendors selling Merilus' suite of computer sec=
urity products.   MANAGEMENT Dana Epp, President of Merilus started writing=
 commercial security monitoring software at the age of 14 and authored the =
book Computer Security Concepts, Managing Business Threats in a Wired World=
.  Merilus has attracted a number of credible and notable Board members suc=
h as John Connally, son of the former US Treasury Secretary, John Paul DeJo=
ria, Chairman of John Paul Mitchell Systems.   FINANCIALS and PROJECTIONS T=
wo companies established in this industry are SonicWall (SNWL) and Watchgua=
rd Technologies (WGRD).  Over the last couple of years these two companies =
have enjoyed approximately 100% annualized revenue growth.  Analyst's conse=
nsus (Thompson Financial) is that they will have sales growth next year of =
about 50% and 40%, respectively. Merilus is in the process of raising $3 mi=
llion in a Private Placement to power its marketing initiatives, increase i=
nventory and to strengthen its balance sheet.  Management and its financier=
s expect to close this needed funding before year-end. Currently the Compan=
y has minimal, but rapidly increasing revenues.    Management is estimating=
 revenues of $8 million next year increasing to $34 million in 2003.  In 20=
03 they estimate achieving net income of roughly $4 million.  By 2003, we e=
stimate the shares outstanding could increase to about 18 million.  If thes=
e numbers were met and a price to earnings ratio of 30 was applied, it coul=
d suggest a possible $6 share price.  Management's latest estimates are for=
 revenues increasing to $93 million in 2004.  Merilus is little known in in=
vestment circles however an Investor Awareness Program is expected to start=
 next week.   For more information see www.merilus.com and call Steve Clare=

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

Don:

I hope that all is well on your end (Enron/Dynegy merger?) & that your
holiday was great.  I'll be interested to hear about your hunting fortunes!

As you suggested in our last conversation a few weeks ago, I'm following up
with you shortly after Thanksgiving.  I just left you a Vmail message to
continue the process in finalizing our win-win "business
arrangement/partnership" regarding the creation and trading of a TNE-Cinergy
index on EOL. I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.
Thanks.

Dear InvestorPlace.com Member,

I've just revealed a BRAND-NEW wireless recommendation
to my subscribers, and I'm SO excited about this
opportunity that I want to share the details with you,
too.

You see, wireless growth is simply exploding around
the world -- especially after the September 11
terrorist attacks.  Cell phone giant Nokia, for
example, has skyrocketed 41% just since October
1st...worldwide wireless traffic is projected to grow a
whopping 30% in 2001 alone...China plans to spend $151
BILLION on its telecom infrastructure by 2005...and
that's just the very BEGINNING of what lies ahead for
this monstrous market!

Quite simply, the profit potential is huge, and I want
to make sure that my subscribers -- and now you -- get
a piece of the phenomenal gains ahead.  That's why I'm
so excited about my newest recommendation.  I expect
it to leap 50% in the next 12 months ALONE, and I'm
looking for more incredible gains after that.  Let me
show you why.

First, you might not even know about this, but there
has been an INTENSE tech competition over the last
couple of years for the new digital wireless standard.
That battle is now over -- and this company has WON!
That means their proprietary technology will be used
in most 2.5G cell phones (set to be deployed early in
2002), and in practically ALL of the next generation
3G phones.  That alone is a terrific boon for this
stock...but keep reading, because this opportunity gets
EVEN BETTER.

Not only does this company get paid for every one of
its chips used in 2.5G or 3G cell phones...but it also
gets paid a license fee from every single company that
wants to sell or market a cell phone based on its
winning technology.  And I'm not talking about a
simple one-time fee either-these royalties get paid on
a QUARTERLY BASIS, for as long as the technology is
used.  One day, thanks to the strength of their
technology, I fully expect this company to get paid
for EVERY single cell phone in use!

And with projections for 1.3 billion cell phone
subscribers by 2003 and continued steady growth in the
following years, this is an absolutely EXPLOSIVE
opportunity for my stock.  This is a $42 billion
company growing an incredible 27% per year and
spending an impressive 17% of revenues on research and
development -- EXACTLY the type of commitment to
future growth that makes me so confident they will
maintain their competitive edge and DOMINATE their
market space for years to come.

I can almost guarantee that you'll be kicking yourself
for years to come if you don't buy this stock now.
DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN TO YOU!  I revealed the name of
this company -- including my buy price, target price
and full profit details -- in the December issue of
Technology Investing, which just got released.

To make sure that you're on board for ALL the profits
we expect to make with this wireless dominator, all
you have to do is accept a RISK-FREE trial to
Technology Investing today.  (Just visit
http://www.ppi-orders.com/index.htm?promo_code=0VN167
to do so now.)  When you do, you'll get the December
issue of Technology Investing immediately, and I'll send
you up to 4 FREE bonus reports with all of the details on
my other tech and biotech recommendations.  Plus, your
subscription will be fully covered by my 100% MONEY-
BACK GUARANTEE.  That means if you're not completely
satisfied within the first 6 months, I'll refund every
single penny you've paid.  No questions asked.

Don't miss out on this monster profit opportunity!

stock tomorrow for 50% gains in the next 12 months.

Michael Murphy

Little David comes home from first grade and tells his father that they
learned about the history of Valentine's Day.  "Since Valentine's day is
for a Christian saint and we're Jewish," he asks, "will God get mad at
me for giving someone a valentine?"

David's father thinks a bit, then says "No, I don't think God would get
mad. Who do you want to give a valentine to?"
"Osama Bin Laden," David says.
"Why Osama Bin Laden," his father asks in shock.

"Well," David says, "I thought that if a little American Jewish boy
could have enough love to give
Osama a valentine, he might start to think that maybe we're not all bad,
and maybe start loving people a little bit.  And if other kids saw what
I did and sent valentines to Osama, he'd love everyone a lot.  And then
he'd start going all over the place to tell everyone how much he loved
them and how he didn't hate anyone anymore."

His father's heart swells and he looks at his boy with newfound pride.
"David, that's the most wonderful thing I've ever heard."
"I know," David says, "and once that gets him out in the open, the
Marines could blow the shit out of him."

Hello Everyone,
 
Well, I looked around again for another inexpensive  ski trip for us to take this year.  The path has seemed to lead the same  direction as it did last year.  Lake Tahoe is by far the cheapest  package deal I can find.  I have already spoken to most of you who went  last year and everyone seems to agree it was a good time and great  atmosphere.  The dates for this adventure are leaving the evening of  January 30th (Wed.) and returning on Febuary 3rd (Sun.).
 
The vacation package is through Southwest Airlines  Vacations.
 
We will stay at the Horizon Casino for 4  nights.
 
We will depart:
Houston Hobby Airport @ 4:50 pm with a short stop  in Las Vegas and arrive into Reno at 9:20 pm.  We will then go by Charter  bus to Lake Tahoe.
 
Leaving Lake Tahoe:
Our plane will depart Reno at 12:10 pm on direct  route to Houston arriving at 6:50 pm.
 
And you ask how much for all this  excitement?
 
This can be all yours for 359.75 per person.   This price is for two people per room.  I will need to know who would like  to go no later than Wednesday  afternoon so I can set up reservations.  These  trips are booking fast.  We will be able to do like last year.  I will  call in the reservations and then each individual person will be able to call  Southwest directly and bill the trip to their own credit card.  The only  other expenses to be prepaid are for ski lift tickets and roundtrip transfer  from the airport to the hotel and back.  This cost is $30.  I figure  we will discuss the lift ticket options.  Some people may want to  Snowmobile a day or do something else.  We will discuss these options  further after the trip is set.
 
Hope to see everyone there.  The snow is  looking good up there so far.  They had 24" on the mountain  yesterday.
 
Mason is going.  I just don't have his e-mail  address but he said to count him in.
 
Scott Tichavsky

Hey Don!

How are you doing? Feeling o.k. today. It was nice meeting you! I wanted to follow up on our conversatian regarding the in house counsel that you may know. Any info. that you could send my way would be tremendous help. I realize there might be a slim chance to get into anybody but it doesn't hurt to try huh? I'm actually fasinated that you are still employed with Enron. That has to be a huge success for you right now. I wanted to fresh your memory on what I'm exactly looking for. I am looking for the person who is in charge of vending out Enron's litigation support. Who will be doing the copying of the documents that Enron has. If you could poke around for me, that would be awesome! My phone # is below so if you need to call me please do so. If you want to e-mail that is fine too. Have a great day off and thanks again for your help!

Don,
 
I have been working with Jeanie Slone on trying to resolve the holiday and overtime payment issues that we have been having with regard to your staff not being properly paid for their overtime and holiday work from Thanksgiving forward.  Unfortunately, I was just told that we can no longer pay any "incentive pay" to previous or current employees as per our bankruptcy lawyers, and at there may be problems because they are "exempt" employees who are typically not paid overtime.  However, I assure you that we are working to try and resolve this matter as soon as possible, and I will follow-up with you as soon as I have further clarification from the attorney's.
 
If you have any other questions, please call me on Amy Fitzpatrick's number (I am sitting at her desk today) at X52729.
 
Thanks,
 
Anne Labbe'

Hey guys,

I talked to Kayne on Monday about the various contracts we have with MDEA to ensure they continued for 2002.  KOCH, NRG, and SEPA all carry over. However, as Mike confirmed in checkouts, SEPA does NOT flow on weekends or holidays and SEPA puts out the tag without consulting us even though the schedule changes regularly.   Currently there is no SEPA schedule in OATI or the services contract book starting 01/07/2002.   Make sure when we do the next day schedules the SEPA contract matches OATI once SEPA puts out the new tags.

Last month we didn't have to place as close attention when scheduling because SEPA put out a tag for the entire month and Laura matched it in the services book for us. 

And for your reference, the January Entergy OASIS #  for WR to MDEA (30MW all day) is: 1025604 (Daily NN-6).  

Happy New Year!

Carrie

Bribe and Groom
During the wedding rehearsal, the groom approached the pastor with an
unusual offer:
"Look, I'll give you $100 if you'll change the wedding vows. When you get to
the part where I'm supposed to promise to 'love, honor and obey' and 'be
faithful to her forever,' I'd appreciate it if you'd just leave that out."
He passed the minister a $100 bill and walked away satisfied. On the day of
the wedding, when it came time for the groom's vows, the pastor looked the
young man in the eye and said:
"Will you promise to prostrate yourself before her, obey her every command
and wish, serve her breakfast in bed every morning of your life, and swear
eternally before God and your lovely wife that you will not ever even look
at another woman, as long as you both shall live?"
The groom gulped and looked around, and said in a tiny voice, "Yes," then
leaned toward the pastor and hissed: "I thought we had a deal."
The pastor put a $100 bill into the groom's hand and whispered: "She made me
a better offer."

Best of the Web Today - December 28, 2001
By JAMES TARANTO
CAIR Package  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20011228/ts/attack_bush_guard_dc_4.html

The Council on American Islamic Relations is stirring up a tempest in a teapot over a Christmas Day incident in which an American Airlines pilot refused to allow an armed Arab-American Secret Service agent on his flight. "American Airlines said it prevented the agent from flying because of discrepancies in the standard forms he filled out identifying himself as an armed law enforcement officer and it denied that the decision was related to his ethnicity," Reuters reports. When his papers checked out, he took another flight.

Although the pilot's fears proved to be unwarranted in this instance, his cautious approach strikes us as eminently sensible. As the  San Francisco Chronicle  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2001/12/28/MN60124.DTL  reports:

*** QUOTE ***

A federal probe conducted last year shows that concern about bogus law enforcement credentials is justified. Undercover inspectors using fake law enforcement credentials and badges "readily available" on the Internet were able to declare themselves "armed law enforcement officers" and skirt security checkpoints at 19 federal agencies--including the CIA, FBI and Pentagon--and two airports, according to the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress which conducted the operation.

"At no time time during the undercover visits were our agents' bogus credentials or badges challenged by anyone," Robert Hast, the GAO's special investigations chief, told Congress last year. Working in teams of two or three, the agents were able to get minivans and satchels that could have been packed with explosives and biological agents past checkpoints.

The agents were waved around metal detectors at Washington's Reagan National Airport and Orlando (Florida) Airport after presenting tickets issued in their undercover aliases and fake credentials.

"Our agents could thus have carried weapons, explosives, chemical/biological agents, or other dangerous objects onto aircraft," GAO manager Gerald Dillingham warned a Senate committee on Sept. 20, nine days after the terrorist attacks in New York and on the Pentagon.

*** END QUOTE ***

In a typically hysterical  press release  http://cair-net.org/asp/article.asp?articleid=559&articletype=3 , CAIR "demanded an apology from American Airlines for removing a Muslim Secret Service agent from a flight apparently based on religious and ethnic profiling":

*** QUOTE ***

In a letter faxed today to American Chairman Donald J. Carty, CAIR wrote: "We are concerned that American Airlines would arbitrarily deny boarding to a Muslim passenger, particularly someone who has one of our nation's highest security clearances, merely because of his religion or ethnicity. The passengers on Flight 363 would actually have been more secure had Agent ------ been allowed to board."

*** END QUOTE ***

The decision to keep the agent off the plane may have been erroneous, but it was hardly "arbitrary." After all, he was carrying a gun!

This incident may point to a need for the Secret Service and other law-enforcement agencies to work with airlines on improving ID procedures to avoid future such incidents. But why in the world is this issue being raised publicly by a group like CAIR, which has an agenda other than the enforcement of laws and protection of American security?

CAIR claims to know the identity of the agent in question, which has not been reported in the press; "for security reasons, CAIR is not releasing his name," the press release says. Did the agent take his grievance to CAIR instead of his superiors at the Secret Service? If so, this strikes us as conduct ill befitting a law-enforcement agent. A Secret Service man is supposed to be prepared to take a bullet for the president. Is it too much to ask that he take a later flight?

Jet-Setting Dishwasher
ABC  http://abcnews.go.com/sections/us/DailyNews/airplane_explosives011228.html ,  CNN  http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/12/27/inv.reid/index.html  and the  Times of London  http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,2001570018-2001601809,00.html  all have accounts of alleged shoe bomber Richard Reid's activities over the past year. For a loser who worked as a dishwasher in Amsterdam, he sure seems to have been loaded. "French intelligence officials have tracked Reid's movements over the last year, saying he traveled to Israel, Egypt, the Netherlands and Belgium, spending money freely, though he did not seem to have the income to fund the trips," ABC reports. CNN has more on the Israel junket:

*** QUOTE ***

Israeli Security Services, in conjunction with the FBI, are looking into what Reid did during a 10-day trip to the country in July, Israeli government sources told CNN.

Reid roused suspicion when he traveled from an unidentified country to Israel on its national airline, El Al, according to airline spokesman Nahman Klaiman.

"Our security people were aroused and [Reid] went through a security check, which included a personal check as well as removal of his shoes, which were checked separately," Klaiman said.

*** END QUOTE ***

Reid was in Amsterdam from August through November, then went to Brussels Dec. 5 and Paris Dec. 16. "A day later, he paid 13,000 French francs (about $1,750) in cash at a Myream Voyage, a travel agency on the rue des Poisoniers in the 18th arrondissement, or section, in Paris for a two-way plane ticket from Paris to Miami to Antigua." On Dec. 22 he tried to fly from Paris to Miami--and ended up instead in a federal prison in Boston.

The Times adds Turkey, Pakistan "and possibly Afghanistan" to Reid's itinerary. The paper cites Israeli intelligence officials who are concerned "that the Islamic fanatic may have tried to make contact with Hamas terrorists who are now known to have developed recent links with Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network." The Times also adds this intriguing detail:

*** QUOTE ***

On December 7 [Reid] travelled to Brussels and stayed a week, during which time he obtained a new British passport from the UK consulate there. His previous passport, which had pages torn out of it, was affixed to the new one, which police believe was Mr Reid's clumsy way of trying to disguise where he had been.

The Israeli visa stamp was still in the old document, as was the Pakistani visa.

*** END QUOTE ***

According to the ABC report, "Government officials told The Associated Press the nonmetal fuses for the explosives allegedly in Reid's shoes may have become wet, and been too moist to light, preventing him from detonating the charges." All this suggests the Reid may not be the brightest candle on the birthday cake.

His Dad Is Bad, but His Mom Is Mum  http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,2001570018-2001602513,00.html

The Times of London also has some details about Reid's upbringing, and in several important respects it resembles that of Marin mujahid John Walker. Like Walker, Reid is a child of divorce, his parents having split when he was four. Also like Walker, Reid had paternal support for his "spiritual journey"; as the Times put it: "Mr Reid said that he had encouraged his son to join the faith because he felt it rejected violence." And like Walker, Reid has a father who is eager to make excuses for him now: "My son is a determined boy and I can imagine him being determined enough to blow himself to bits," the elder Reid tells the Times. "But I just can't believe that he would want to hurt anyone else in doing it unless, that is, he has been brainwashed."

Two differences: Whereas Walker's father is a lawyer, Reid's is a common criminal. "He was absent for much of Richard's childhood after spending time in prison for a series of car thefts and burglaries." And unlike Walker's mother, Reid's mom, Lesley Hughes, has comported herself with dignity since her son's arrest.  Reuters  http://sg.news.yahoo.com/reuters/asia-80865.html  quotes a statement released through Hughes's lawyers: "As any mother would be, she is deeply shocked and concerned about the allegations made against her son, but has no further comment to make."

The Meaning of Multiculturalism  http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/12/28/wreid128.xml&sSheet=/portal/2001/12/28/ixport.html

The London Telegraph, in an article on Reid, has a telling quote from Abdul Haqq Baker, the moderate chairman of the Brixton mosque, where Reid and "20th hijacker" Zacarias Moussaoui worshipped before taking a more militant route:

*** QUOTE ***

Mr Baker said: "We have a lot of converts and ex-convicts. Many just turn up with their bags straight from prison. They come because we are tolerant and we teach in English. But because they are new to Islam they can be easily led. Extremists tell them that we are wrong and they are right. They brainwash them and take them to study groups away from the mosque where they learn to hate.

"Their teachings are extremely severe. To appreciate this, you should know that they say things like, 'Those who have AIDS and want to embrace Islam, the best thing they can do is go to Palestine, strap a bomb to themselves, and blow themselves up.' "

*** END QUOTE ***

Sins of Commission?  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A32508-2001Dec27.html

The Defense Department has issued draft procedures for the military commissions that will try noncitizens suspected of terrorism, and it appears civil libertarians were crying wolf. Under the draft procedures, the Washington Post reports, suspects "would be presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, could be sentenced to death only by a unanimous vote of the commissions' members and would have the right to an appeal."

Take a Cold Peshawar  http://uk.news.yahoo.com/011228/80/cmppz.html

Two more Afghan officials claim Osama bin Laden is in Pakistan. Reuters quotes Gen. Mohammad Fahim, the defense minister, who backs up his spokesman's  comment yesterday  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001649#where : "After fleeing from Tora Bora there is a strong probability that Osama is in Peshawar," Fahim tells the wire service. "Osama is out of our control. To a large extent it depends on Pakistan. America can pursue him with the help of the Pakistani government."

CNN  http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/east/12/28/inv.bin.laden.location/index.html  quotes Abdullah Tawheedi, "a deputy head of intelligence in Afghanistan," as saying that "he has received 'reliable information' that the terrorist leader paid a 'large amount' of money to buy his way out of Afghanistan." Larger than  $25 million  http://www.fbi.gov/mostwant/topten/fugitives/laden.htm ?

Our Friends the Chinese--II  http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200112/24/eng20011224_87389.shtml

The Chinese Foreign Ministry is disputing a report by the Washington Times'  Bill Gertz  http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20011221-95780908.htm  that Beijing sold arms to al Qaeda after Sept. 11. A report in the People's Daily quotes Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue as calling the Gertz report "groundless" and "with ulterior motives."  Matt Drudge  http://www.drudgereport.com/flash.htm  reports that Gertz stands by his story.

Eat Your Heart Out, Christo  http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/dec/28taj.htm

The Press Trust of India reports that "the Taj Mahal, the 16th century monument of love, would be covered by a battle green cloth to protect it from possible air strikes if an Indo-Pak war breaks out." There's a precedent for the Taj camouflage: "During the previous Indo-Pak war in 1971, the monument was covered with green clothes [sic]."

Stupidity Watch
Michael Scott-Joynt  http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,625233,00.html , bishop of Winchester, is the British left's answer to  Jerry Falwell  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001143#falwell . In his Christmas Day sermon, excerpted in the London Observer, Scott-Joynt blames the West for Sept. 11:

*** QUOTE ***

Would we be in this situation, if western--north American and European--electorates, all with deep Christian pedigrees, had not encouraged, supported or at least allowed our governments, over so many decades, to develop our standard of living at the expense of millions in the southern hemisphere? And if we had not sold their rulers armaments on such favourable terms, and with so little forethought? Cruelly evil though they were, I find that I have to understand the events of September 11 as a judgment upon us; and so, to understand these weeks, this Christmas, as a critical moment, an opportunity for a fresh beginning, its character caught in those words we have read: "Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus."

*** END QUOTE ***

Meanwhile, the Times of London's  Anatole Kaletsky  http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,248-2001600195,00.html  manages to label just about everyone on the right as a "fundamentalist"--over matters that have nothing to do with religion (emphasis ours):

*** QUOTE ***

The right-wing zealots among the Republican leadership, on the other hand, see the present war fever and terrorist paranoia as a golden opportunity to impose market fundamentalism and anti-tax economics. . . . President Bush seems to lack the intelligence or the leadership ability to overcome this political fanaticism and economic sabotage. He cannot force the Democrats to support the right-wing fundamentalist agenda of the Republican leadership. And he seems unable or unwilling to force Republican fundamentalists to compromise with mainstream Democrats.

*** END QUOTE ***

We suppose calling people "fundamentalists" isn't as bad as calling them "Taliban," but this is all just a substitute for thought, much like throwing around words like "fascist" or "Nazi" to describe people who are nothing of the sort.

Flue Season?  http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-122301fire.story

Overlawyered.com  http://overlawyered.com/ , among others, spotted this one: The wackos on the Berkeley, Calif., City Council have "banned log-burning fireplaces in new homes and other buildings, believing the warmth of wood fires comes at the cost of clean air," the Los Angeles Times reports. Jami Caseber, the "environmental activist" who led the drive, also wants to ban the use of existing fireplaces.
 
The ordinance is drawing some opposition from bobo Berkeleyites, because it also applies to wood-burning cooking equipment. It "has incensed Alice Waters, owner of Berkeley's Chez Panisse restaurant and a world-famous advocate for organic foods. Waters said she burns half a cord of oak and fig weekly in her grill and oven, which have no pollution-control equipment." Although her appliances are grandfathered under the just-passed law, she tells the Times she's "totally opposed" to the law. "We've had a fundamental connection between fire and food since the beginning of time. Until we stop driving cars, I'd rather live in a world with wood-burning ovens."

The last I heard, the MISO is supposed to begin offering service on their OASIS tomorrow for service starting January 1.  I wanted to let all of you know a bit about where we stand with regards to that process.

I have been working with several different folks here and at the MISO to ensure that we are ready to do business with the MISO and request service.  The MISO OASIS seems to be accepting our Tradewave Certs, so we just need to get our MISO login for their systems. Today, the MISO will be sending out logins to their systems via FedEx, and should arrive prior to 10am.  Christi Nicolay will be receiving this information and distributing it as soon as it arrives. 

Unfortunately, the MISO has been (as you probably know) cutting things closer and closer to the edge.  This login was supposed to be delivered a couple weeks ago, but they have just gotten around to sending it out.  Hopefully, we will not have any problems with it once it arrives.  As I understand it, there should be only one login set up for "EPMI 24-Hour Operations," with a login of "Enron."  The password is currently only known by the MISO, but should be contained in the letter we receive tomorrow.

This login is a temporary one until we complete our final registration.  This final registration has been a bit more of a pain, as it has involved contractual agreements and credit obligations.  I am still working with our Legal, Credit, and AP folks to get everything set up.  Again, the MISO sent the final documents out fairly recently, and we have not had a great amount of time to review, analyze, and negotiate their terms.  Hopefully, we will have come to agreement with MISO about those items, and be able to file that final application soon.

If you have any questions or concerns, you can reach me at my desk (X53771) or via my cellular (713-927-4680).  Obviously, you can also call Christi (X37007) or Susan Lindberg (X30596) as well.

DARWIN AWARDS:  Chlorinating the Gene Pool - 5 February 2002

IN THIS ISSUE:
	Darwin Award: STUDENT COMPACTOR
	Darwin Award: RISKY REENACTMENT
	Honorable Mention: CHARCOAL GRILLED
	Personal Account: REGULAR & EXTRA CRISPY

--------------------------------------------+---+-+---+-+-+-+-+

Darwin Award: STUDENT COMPACTOR

October 2001, Tennessee | Eight freshman college students were hanging
around a vacant library late one night, when they decided it would be
a thrill to leap into a small opening they thought was a laundry chute.

Perhaps a few more years of college would have helped them realize that
libraries don't often have laundry chutes. It was actually a garbage
chute feeding directly into an automatic trash compactor. 19-year-old
Wesley was the first to jump, and he enjoyed an exhilarating three-story
slide before being crushed to death in the rubbish bin below.

The other students decided not to follow.

Darwin Award: RISKY REENACTMENT

October 1993, Illinois | A police officer was trying to show another
patrolman how their fellow officer accidentally killed himself, by
reenacting the shooting incident a week later. But the 20-year veteran
forgot to unload his .357 Magnum and wound up shooting himself in the
stomach. He died in a car crash while driving himself to the hospital.

Honorable Mention: CHARCOAL GRILLED

October 2001, Florida | A dozen Burger King marketing department
employees found out first-hand why meat cooks... when they burned
their feet on hot coals during a fire-walking ritual. It's the heat!

One woman was hospitalized and the others were treated by a doctor
summoned to the scene. The company-sponsored event was intended to
promote teamwork. Next time you complain about your company's inane
team-building exercises, remember this story and count yourself lucky.

Personal Account: REGULAR & EXTRA CRISPY

"I own a family entertainment center with arcade and video games.
We occasionally replace out-of-date games, and dismantle the old
ones into pieces small enough to toss in the dumpster out back.

"One day I gave our two intrepid game room employees, nicknamed
Podunk and Donut after their radio call signs, the task of destroying
two outmoded games. The first game was sent to Atari heaven with
no fuss, thanks to a 5-pound sledgehammer. The second game was more
obstinate. The boys broke the handle of the sledgehammer against it.

"So Podunk and Donut decided to heave heavy cinderblocks at it.
But that only succeeded if you consider broken cinderblocks a success.
They tried ramming the game with a car, which did little but damage
the vehicle's front end. Brute force was getting them nowhere fast.

"In the interest of safety, speed, efficiency, and a minimum of
wear and tear on their tools, they decided to burn the game down.

"Podunk filled the interior of the game with fumes from an aerosol can,
while Donut manned the cigarette lighter. You can guess the rest.
Both employee's sustained second degree burns to their arms and faces,
and the game cabinet is still alive and well.

"Now the boys have new names: Regular and Extra Crispy."

Best of the Web Today - December 31, 2001
By JAMES TARANTO
A Little Too Late  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/30/national/30TERR.html?pagewanted=all

Just in time for the end of the year (and the Pulitzer entries), the New York Times (link requires registration) publishes a very long (6,000 words plus) and detailed narrative of America's failed antiterror policies, from 1993 to 2001. The Clinton administration part of that story is familiar: The administration was aware of the growing threat from al Qaeda, and took some steps to counter it, but was too distracted by the president's quest for a "legacy," and by his actual legacy (impeachment) to give the matter the kind of sustained attention it needed.

The most interesting detail, though, is that President Bush was actually ahead of the curve, though alas, not by nearly enough:

*** QUOTE ***

Administration officials say the president was concerned about the growing threat and frustrated by the halfhearted efforts to thwart Al Qaeda. In July, [Condoleezza] Rice said, Mr. Bush likened the response to the Qaeda threat to "swatting at flies." He said he wanted a plan to "bring this guy down."

*** END QUOTE ***

As the Washington Post previously reported, Bush's national security advisers approved a $200 million anti-al Qaeda plan. But Bush was traveling on the day it was to have been presented to him--Sept. 10.

What a Gas  http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,2001570019-2001603346,00.html

Documents found in Kabul houses show that al Qaeda had tested chemical weapons, including cyanide gas, on animals, the Times of London reports. Al Qaeda's knowledge of how to make weapons of mass destruction appears to have been "crude" and the studies "were the work of a variety of autonomous cells, who conducted their own experiments, without collusion." The Times quotes an "intelligence expert" as saying that "this proves a huge problem to the Western security forces. What we can see is the work of different, potentially self-replicating cells, united only by an ideal. They will be far more difficult to extinguish than a centrally organized terrorist force."

Al Qaeda, American Style  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40010-2001Dec29.html

"The FBI is conducting more than 150 separate investigations into groups and individuals in the United States with possible ties to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda organization," the Washington Post reports. "The domestic targets include dozens of people who are under electronic surveillance through national security warrants, and others who are being watched by undercover agents attempting to learn more about their activities and associates, officials said." Frustratingly but understandably, officials are saying little about the specifics of the investigations.

Protected by the Federal Government  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/nyt/20011229/ts/officials_to_ease_requirements_on_hiring_of_airline_screeners_1.html

"After stoking high expectations that the federal takeover of airport security would lead to a new breed of airport security screener, one who was better educated and more qualified to assume a position of increased responsibility, the Department of Transportation has decided not to impose rules that would displace thousands of current screeners," the New York Times reports. In particular, screeners won't have to have high school diplomas; a year's work experience--including experience in the much-derided pre-Sept. 11 airport-security system--will suffice.

"The idea is to allow current screeners who would otherwise qualify but may not have high school diplomas to be eligible, so they do not get left behind," explains the Transportation Department's Paul Takemoto. Well, pardon us if this is a rude question, but wasn't the whole idea of federalizing airport security to leave the old, inadequate screeners behind?

Not as Dumb as He Looked  http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-122901profile.story

A pair of Los Angeles Times articles floats the theory that alleged shoe bomber Richard Reid was more sophisticated than he appeared. "He had one most important trait: He was very calm in an extremely stressful situation," Magnus Ranstorp, a terrorism expert from Scotland, tells the Times. The paper adds that "even his down-and-out appearance may have been a reverse undercover strategy, based on a calculation that he looked too obvious to be a real threat." Bolstering this view is an account in the London  Observer  http://www.observer.co.uk/waronterrorism/story/0,1373,625868,00.html :

*** QUOTE ***

As he passed through security at Charles de Gaulle, an employee of ICTS, the private firm policing the airport, was suspicious. His profile--a lone traveller, who bought his ticket in cash and had no baggage--raised an automatic red flag. His knapsack contained only a Koran, a Walkman with religious tapes and a magazine. Reid claimed he was visiting relatives. He explained his lack of luggage by saying his family had ample clothes for him. The interrogation took so long he missed his flight. He stayed in a hotel at the airline's expense. There had been no body search and no sniffer dogs.

The next morning Reid turned up two hours early for the 10.40 flight. This time security staff--recognising him from the previous day--waved him through.

*** END QUOTE ***

The  second L.A. Times story  http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-122901tatp.story  says that Reid's shoes were actually "a relatively sophisticated explosive device," though "not beyond the capability of an individual acting alone." The  Jerusalem Post  http://www.jpost.com/Editions/2001/12/30/News/News.40789.html  adds that the explosive "was similar to that developed and used by Hamas in suicide bombings and other terrorist attacks."

Another Observer piece  http://www.observer.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,625797,00.html  says that Britain's MI5 intelligence agency "knew of links between shoe bomber Richard Reid and one 11 September hijack suspect late last year, but failed to track Reid before he tried to blow up an airliner, according to US intelligence reports." MI5 "intercepted phone calls between Reid and the suspect, Zacarias Moussaoui, which directly linked Bromley-born Reid to Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda net work, but did not realise their implication until it was too late," according to the report.

Jihadi Jailbirds  http://www.opinion.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/12/30/nmus30.xml

Reid converted to Islam while in prison, and Britain's prisons turn out to be breeding grounds for Islamic extremism, according to a series of reports in the London press. The Telegraph notes that the British government "ignored specific warnings more than a year ago that Muslim extremists were infiltrating prisons and recruiting inmates." And the  Times  http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,2001570019-2001603123,00.html  reports that Muslim clerics preaching in British prisons have been told "that they were being watched carefully after two were suspended for allegedly delivering anti-American sermons to young inmates after the September 11 attacks."

In a Telegraph op-ed piece,  Jonathan Aitken  http://www.opinion.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/12/30/nmus230.xml , a former Conservative member of Parliament who served a prison term for perjury, says that during his time behind bars, "on four occasions, fellow prisoners who were Muslim came to talk to me to see if I would be interested in converting to Islam." Aitken says he had no encounters with Muslim militants, but he observes that "the Richard Reid case is anything but an exception. Rather, it is the militant face of a much broader phenomenon: the Islamic mission that is a new and astonishing feature of British prison life."

Theodore Dalrymple  http://www.nationalpost.com/commentary/story.html?f=/stories/20011229/990690.html , a British physician who treats prisoners, explains Islam's appeal to prisoners: "Bonversion to Islam kills two birds with one stone. It fulfils a personal need, but it is also an act of revenge upon society: for official multiculturalism notwithstanding, everyone knows that Western societies are profoundly uneasy about their infiltration by an increasingly confident and militant Islam that uses Western liberal principles to spread itself in the way communism once did."

Dalrymple notes, however, that Islam isn't the only religion that wins converts in prison. "I have noticed a sub-group of prisoners, for example, who turn to Buddhism while incarcerated. They can almost always be recognized physically: they sport pony tails and have an air of unnatural and studied calm. The pony-tailed Buddhist has usually committed the most terrible and violent offences in his past: and from an utter disregard for human life, he suddenly becomes solicitous even about the life of insects."

But Did They Check Her Shoes?  http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0112300170dec30.story

A former member of Chicago's Board of Education is behind bars after an outburst at O'Hare International Airport. Police tell the Chicago Tribune that Anna Mustafa, who was the board's first Arab-American member, became irate when she was randomly selected to pass through a bomb-detection machine before boarding a Swissair flight to Tel Aviv. "When told, she became irate and began shouting at the manager and employees and made inappropriate comments that she may have a bomb in her purse," a police spokeswoman says. "People at the next counter heard. People didn't want to board the plane after that." No explosives were found in her bag.

Comfort to the Enemy  http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/1189855

Columnist Helen Thomas, doyenne of the White House press corps, urges President Bush to go easy on Marin mujahid John Walker:

*** QUOTE ***

Perhaps in mulling over Walker's life, he will try to remember when he was a 20-year-old. True, he did not defiantly challenge the system as so many young protesters did in the Vietnam War era. Politics was not his bag at Yale when others were marching in support of civil rights and against the war.

Nor had he yet found religion as the guiding light of his life. He surely knows he was a different person back then. The president has often sought to dismiss his youthful escapades with the cute tautology: "When I was young and foolish, I was young and foolish."

There undoubtedly are many who want Walker to pay with his life. But there are a lot of others in the country who will want Bush to go easier on Walker--a lighter sentence perhaps--with compassion lighting his way. I hope so.

We're a forgiving people. This young man obviously made a big mistake. The president should show that he understands this by setting a merciful course in the Walker case.

*** END QUOTE ***

Before urging forgiveness, wouldn't it be a good idea at least to wait and see if Walker repents and acknowledges he did wrong? So far as we know, there's been no indication he's done so.

More important, Thomas's logic is morally slovenly. Why is Walker entitled to more compassion than the Afghans, Arabs, Pakistanis, Chechens and other natives of Muslim lands who've fought for the Taliban and al Qaeda? If anything, a far better argument can be made that they are victims of circumstance, having had an upbringing in an environment that encourages Islamic fanaticism. Walker, on the other hand, plainly chose to abandon his country and join its enemies.

"Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists," President Bush said in his historic Sept. 20 speech. Helen Thomas, it appears, would have Bush add a qualification: ". . . unless you come from a respectable, middle-class American family." If we coddle our domestic enemies while killing our foreign ones, we will deserve a bit of the world's scorn.

Village Voice vs. CNN  http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0201/cotts.php

Remember when critics on the left were bewailing John Ashcroft's supposed attack on civil liberties? Now Cynthia Cotts of the Village Voice is going a step further. It seems the First Amendment is a threat to civil liberties. Cotts blasts CNN for airing an interview with John Walker, saying that the network's free and vigorous reporting displays "the power of media to indict a man more efficiently than any prosecutor."

"He hasn't talked to a lawyer, but he's already a scapegoat who can be spit upon and molded into anything you want him to be," Cotts complains. "Welcome to the latest weapon in the war on terror: the media tribunal."

Cotts's column also includes this paranoid aside:

*** QUOTE ***

Certain unsavory aspects of the story have been downplayed. For example, CNN shows from the night of December 19 offered many interesting details about the Walker tape. But on the Lexis-Nexis database, which carries CNN transcripts, the December 19 transcripts of Larry King Live and NewsNight With Aaron Brown are conspicuously missing. A fluke?

*** END QUOTE ***

CNN, Cotts implies, is trying to suppress Brown and King guests who called into question whether Walker is guilty of treason. Well, this wasn't a very successful censorship job, seeing as how both transcripts are available on  CNN's Web site  http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2001.12.19.html .

Our Friends the Saudis  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20011230/ts/attack_saudi_dc_1.html

Crown Price Abdullah is urging Arab and Muslim leaders to denounce terrorism. "It is the duty of all Muslims in these circumstances to condemn all terrorist acts, without ambiguity," he said in Oman. Now he tells us. But Abdullah also said that Muslims should "demonstrate the vast and clear difference between terrorism and legitimate national struggle for the sake of self determination." Translation: Murdering Jews in Israel is hunky-dory.

Another Saudi view comes from  Khaled Al-Maeena  http://www.arabnews.com/Article.asp?ID=11625 , editor of the English-language Arab News. Here's his defense of the Saudis' hate-instilling religious schools:

*** QUOTE ***

Charles Whitman, the university student who climbed up the university tower in Texas in 1966 with an arsenal of weapons, and then killed 17 of his fellow students and teachers and injured many more, was not a product of Saudi schools. The Columbine school massacres were committed by schoolboys who did not receive their primary education in Riyadh. The followers of Charles Manson, who believed the latter was God and blindly obeyed his orders to go on a killing spree, were not educated in Dhahran. Timothy McViegh did not attend a madrassa. The Una bomber [sic] was neither a student nor a professor at a Saudi university. The thousands who accepted without question orders given by Rev. Jim Jones to commit suicide in Jonestown, Guyana, on Nov. 18, 1978, were not educated in Hofuf.

Scenes From the 'Legitimate National Struggle'  http://www.jpost.com/Editions/2001/12/31/LatestNews/LatestNews.40864.html
 
A senior Palestinian Authority official "reportedly recently tried to convince Fatah military wing Tanzim operatives in Nablus to give themselves up and enter PA jails in order to bluff US and European observers," the Jerusalem Post says, picking up an Israel Radio report. "The PA official reportedly offered $3,000 to anyone willing to spend a month in PA detention in lieu of Hamas of Islamic Jihad terrorists."

An  Associated Press  http://www.winonadailynews.com/news/4world.php  dispatch notes that Leila Khaled, who "hijacked two airliners in 1969 and 1970 for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine," is now a member of the Palestinian Parliament.

Our Friends the Pakistanis  http://www.abc.net.au/news/2001/12/item20011230112450_1.htm

Afghanistan's interior minister says that Osama bin Laden is moving back and forth between Afghanistan and Pakistan, Australia's ABC News reports. "The fact that there has not been any reaction and that (bin Laden) has not been arrested, indicates that he is somehow being supported by the Pakistani ISI," says Yunis Qanuni, referring to the Inter-Services Intelligence agency.

Yikes!  http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,3-2001605798,00.html

Tensions are high between Pakistan and India in the wake of this month's terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament in New Delhi. Both countries have nuclear weapons, and although India has a "no first use" policy, it "boasted yesterday that it would survive a first strike by a Pakistani atomic weapon, but that its neighbour would be wiped out in a swift nuclear counter-attack," the Times of London reports.

The New York Times'  William Safire  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/31/opinion/31SAFI.html  argues that the Bush doctrine--"whenever a government offers safe haven to terrorists, it ceases to be sovereign"--requires America to take India's side: "Whatever the merits of the Kashmir dispute, India is right to demand that President Pervez Musharraf crack down on the terrorist network operating out of Pakistan 'or else.' The U.S. owes Musharraf plenty for his help against the Taliban in the face of hot internal opposition, but we owe the new antiterror principle more."

Needed: More Missiles  http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/12/30/wirq30.xml

"A shortage of cruise missiles has thrown plans for a full-scale strike on Iraq into disarray," London's Daily Telegraph reports. "Strikes against Afghanistan and Sudan in 1998 and Kosovo two years ago virtually exhausted the US supply. The number of conventional [non-nuclear] air launched cruise missiles left within the inventory is believed to be fewer than 30." But the Telegraph quotes a Pentagon spokesman: "The military chiefs are aware of the situation and measures are in place to fix it."

Stupidity Watch  http://www.uscatholic.org/2002/01/cov0201.htm

This flight into mindless moral equivalence by Farid Esack, a South African Islam scholar, needs no comment:

*** QUOTE ***

I see it as a clash between two religious fundamentalisms. On the one side you have the Taliban, Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda, and the actions we have witnessed. All that clearly represents the fanaticism of a religious fundamentalism.

On the other side of the conflict we are dealing with another religious fundamentalism, one that is not generally recognized as such. The Buddhist theologian David Loy has described faith in the free market as a religion, a religion with a transcendent god, a god that is worshiped and that its adherents have a deep yearning to embrace and to be at one with--and that god is capital.

It also has a theology in the form of economics, a fundamentalist ideology that excludes all others. Its cathedrals are the shopping malls, and there is paradise or the promise of paradise for those who get on board. It is the fastest growing religion in the world today.

If you look at the language of your president, his notion of absolute evil and complete abhorrence, as well as Osama's language of complete abhorrence, neither recognizes the possibility of any grace on the other side. Both espouse very hardened kinds of fundamentalisms.

I don't think that Bush is the problem, but neither is Osama solely the problem. It's these fundamentalisms and what gives rise to them that are the crucial issue.

Is the Norwegian Nobel Committee Reading This?  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28267-2001Dec26.html

"The United Nations quashed an investigation earlier this year into whether U.N. police were directly involved in the enslavement of Eastern European women in Bosnian brothels," the Washington Post reports. Boy, we'd hate to hear what the Nobel Peace Prize losers are up to.

Two Americas  http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/12/29/freedom.float.ap/index.html

The Associated Press reports that 59-year-old Madalenna Lai, who came to America in 1977 as a Vietnamese refugee, sold her house to raise $100,000, with which she built a float that will appear in tomorrow's Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, Calif. "Her 35-foot long, 18-feet wide float will carry a simple message: 'Thank you America and the world.' "

What a contrast with  Nikkita Gardner  http://fyi.cnn.com/2001/fyi/teachers.ednews/12/28/young.people.ap/index.html , a junior at Northern Illinois University, quoted in another AP dispatch. She says: "I think a lot of minorities feel like 'Why should we fight? What has our country done for us?' "

Heavy Metal Poisoning  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/27/arts/music/27ANTH.html

The New York Times (link requires registration) reports that these have been tough times for  Anthrax  http://anthrax.com/ --not the germ but the heavy-metal band: "Slowly emerging from the Get What You Asked For file, Anthrax, whose members once reveled in how coolly evil the band sounded, has been humbled by its ironic association with terrorism, even as many of its older records have been selling at double their usual, albeit modest, pace--perhaps the first time that a biological attack has prompted a spike in heavy-metal album sales." Given al Qaeda's reported interest in chemical weapons, we'll bet  Poison  http://www.poisonweb.com/  ("the No. 1 glam-metal band of all time," according to VH1) is getting a bit nervous.

So Long, Rudy  http://city-journal.org/html/12_1_in_prospect.html

City Journal editor Myron Magnet pays tribute to New York's Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who turns the reins over to Michael Bloomberg tomorrow:

*** QUOTE ***

Giuliani's biggest idea was that human affairs are not governed by vast, impersonal forces but by individual decisions. New York was of course governable--provided you had the will and vision to do the governing. You couldn't shrug, turn your palms upward, and appeal to some abstraction over which you had no control--the nation's irresistible suburbanization, say, or the Internet's inevitable dissolution of the cities--to absolve yourself for failure. Assuming, as Giuliani assumed, that talented, entrepreneurial people would always like to live near one another for the electricity such closeness generates, he took responsibility for creating the conditions in which that could keep happening in the place proverbially paved with gold. And he succeeded.

*** END QUOTE ***

We came to New York in 1990--a few months after Giuliani lost his first race, to David Dinkins--and we can attest to Rudy's success. We haven't been mugged since Dinkins was mayor, and we don't at all miss the race riots that engulfed various New York neighborhoods on an almost regular schedule during the reign of Dinkins, who was elected as a "racial healer."

Although adulation for Giuliani seems almost universal today, especially after Sept. 11, he drew bitter opposition from a lunatic fringe that has some influence in the city. An example is this Dec. 27, 1999, piece by "artist"  Robert Lederman  http://www.openair.org/alerts/artist/nytour.html :

*** QUOTE ***

We do face a real terrorist threat in New York City but it's not from fundamentalists in turbans or bible belt militias. The main suspect resides in Gracie Mansion, has a taxpayer funded office in City Hall and lately hides out in his high-tech bunker in the World Trade Center. He depicts himself as an advocate of law and order while actually being the biggest lawbreaker in the entire City. While mouthing platitudes about the glories of liberty and free speech and the dignity of work, he uses 680 lawyers to subvert the Constitution, is an outright enemy of anyone's free speech but his own and has a view of work closer to a WWII forced labor camp than an actual job.

As the ball drops in Times Square on New Year's Eve let's hope we will be seeing the final curtain call in the career of Mayor Rudy Crueliani.

*** END QUOTE ***

Nor is this attitude limited to a few self-proclaimed "artists." We recall being at a party a couple of years ago where a professor at a prestigious New York university (not an Ivy League one, we hasten to add) expressed her desire to see the mayor assassinated.

Mayor-elect Bloomberg comes to office something of a question mark, a businessman with no government experience. It's hard to say what kind of mayor he'll be, but if he manages to inspire the same kind of deranged hate Giuliani did in the academic and artistic fever swamps, it'll surely be a sign of success.

Homelessness Rediscovery Watch: Et Tu, Tommy?

"If George W. Bush becomes president, the armies of the homeless, hundreds of thousands strong, will once again be used to illustrate the opposition's arguments about welfare, the economy, and taxation."-- Mark Helprin  http://opinionjournal.com/columnists/mhelprin/?id=65000507 , Oct. 31, 2000

"Health and Human Services Secretary  Tommy Thompson  http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,41706,00.html  recognized National Homeless Persons' Memorial Day as he 'encouraged the nation to take the time to remember the millions of homeless individuals who don't have a warm bed, a nutritious meal, or a family to go home to this holiday.' Although the day has been marked by homeless activists since 1990, this is the first time the federal government has paid its respects. Even the bleeding heart Clinton administration never recognized it."--Steven Milloy, FoxNews.com, Dec. 27, 2001

Multilateralism Works  http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/east/12/30/japan.kyoto/index.html

In a tribute to President Bush's stature as a world leader, Japan has "effectively abandoned the Kyoto Protocol," CNN reports. "Japanese industry groups have forced the government to drop mandatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions under the Kyoto agreement, making it unlikely Tokyo will be able to meet its reduction targets, the Yomiuri newspaper said."

Red Alert  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/29/arts/design/29LIBE.html

Under the headline "A Tantrum Over Art in Memphis," the New York Times (link requires registration) reports that some conservative Tennesseans are outraged over a piece of public art:

*** QUOTE ***

At first, few noticed their five famous words--"Workers of the world, unite!"--inscribed among dozens of other quotations outside the gleaming new $70 million Memphis Central Library, which opened in November.

But then this phrase from the Communist Manifesto caught the eye of two county commissioners and a city councilman, and in these days of heightened patriotism a smoldering debate was ignited on a popular radio talk show, in the letters and opinion column of The Commercial Appeal of Memphis and in the three politicians' own correspondence and phone calls. . . .

For the directors of the library and the UrbanArt Commission, the semipublic agency that commissioned the sidewalk art in which the revolutionaries' words make an appearance, these patriotic stirrings miss the point. They point out that Marx and Engels take their turn on the library pavement alongside as varied a bunch as anyone could think of: the Cat in the Hat by Dr. Seuss, a Japanese crane, a W.C. Handy ode to Beale Street and dozens of other words, images and symbols that would not have fit into the ideology of the two Germans.

*** END QUOTE ***

The Times quotes Kenneth Jackson, a Columbia University historian, who likens the objecting citizens to Lloyd Binford, Memphis's official censor in the 1950s, who, the Times says, "kept the citizens from seeing movies with too much female flesh and too much interracial mixing." Says Jackson: "I'm hoping that Memphis is putting that more narrow view of the world in its own past. Politicians jousting about an imaginary enemy is not very productive."

Well, OK, the whole thing is kind of silly. Still, we have just one question. Suppose instead of a commie slogan, it was a Confederate flag among the various icons on the sidewalk, and instead of conservatives, it was blacks who were objecting. Would the Times and Ken Jackson mock them as a bunch of rubes throwing a "tantrum"?

Dear Investor,

This little biotech company just may have THE ANSWER
to prostate cancer...

...and a lock on one of the largest -- and most
lucrative -- health markets of the Western world.
Best of all, its stock is what I call a  "Why the heck
not" investment.  It's low-priced -- you can pick up a
thousand shares for around $1,200 now.  And it has the
potential to MULTIPLY that small investment 10-to-20
TIMES over in the next couple years.

See why I call it "Why the heck not?"  Just a tiny
amount of risk capital can turn into a really nice
chunk of change.

Frankly, my worst expectations are for a NEAR-TERM
DOUBLE.  That happens and you can even sell half your
position, keep half -- and have none of your original
investment at risk.  Everything after that is gravy!

THAT'S THE BIOTECH GAME, my friend.  It's one of the
few ways left for the average guy to get stinking
rich.  So if you've got a little cash to spare -- and
have a love for tape-measure home runs -- you've got
to check this stock out.

Here's the story.

Gene sequencing and human cloning get all the
headlines, but a lot of the most compelling work in
biotech comes from much more "boring" fields.  This
little company -- for example -- is doing AMAZING
STUFF with common carbohydrate compounds.  In fact,
its experimental drug GBC-590 may prove to be one of
the biggest success stories of the decade.

LET ME STRESS the word "experimental."  It's not
approved yet -- it's still going through clinical
trials.  That's why the stock price is so low...but
that's also why you have a chance to multiply your
investment twenty fold -- if you get in now!

This drug may be experimental, but it's also on the
FAST-TRACK towards FDA-approval.  Management stepped
up the pace of clinical studies after initial results
proved very favorable.

In fact, Phase 1 results -- primarily used to show the
safety of a drug -- showed REMARKABLE BENEFITS against
prostate cancer.  It stabilized or reduced PSA
(prostate specific antigen) levels in 80% of the
patients, with advanced cancer, tested!  High PSAs, of
course, are a marker of prostate cancer -- and a sign
that the disease is spreading uncontrollably.

Today, there is no effective treatment that improves
the survival rates for men whose cancer continues to
spread -- even after surgery.  That's why this news is
so important.  It means new hope for patients who
thought they had none.

AND FOR INVESTORS like us, it means wealth potentially
beyond our wildest dreams.

Remember, clinical trials are still ongoing.  But GBC-
590 seems to work by attaching itself to receptor
points on individual cells, much like the space
shuttle docks at the orbiting space station.  Once
"locked in," this drug thwarts the typical metastatic
action -- that is, it stops the cancer from spreading!

Imagine the wealth-building potential!  But the story
doesn't stop there.

Animal-modeling with GBC-590 suggests a possible
BREAKTHROUGH in the treatment of pancreatic cancer,
which typically has a five-year death rate of 99%!
43% of mice survived past the 43-day benchmark versus
none given the most-commonly used drug for pancreatic
cancer.  And 33% of the GBC-590 mice were 100% CURED
of their tumors!

Phase II trials on human pancreatic and colorectal
cancer patients are now underway.  And any positive
news here should send this stock skyrocketing.

WHAT'S MORE, this biotech is not some one-trick pony.
One of its more interesting developments is CAN-296, a
new breakthrough against drug-resistant fungus,
including Aspergillus and Candida.  Pre-clinical
studies suggest it's very effective and extremely
fast-acting.  Icing on the cake!

I won't claim that everyone should own this stock.
It's an aggressive play, and no one should put a lot
of money in it.

But then again, you don't need a lot.  Just a small
investment now could well mushroom into a not-so-small
FORTUNE over the next several years.  I think it's
worth a look -- and a few thousand dollars, as well.

TRY A RISK-FREE trial subscription to my Forecasts &
Strategies advisory and I'll give you this company's
name NOW -- immediately, online.  You'll also get a
Special Introductory Report detailing all my top
current recommendations.

And trust me, they're not all biotech.  I've got a
host of stocks, funds, income vehicles and more that
are all TOP-NOTCH investments for times like these.

Best of all, when I say a "risk-free subscription," I
mean it.  Try Forecasts & Strategies for six full
months and see if I'm blowing smoke or making you
money.  If you don't like F&S -- if you're not getting
richer -- just say, "No thanks," and your subscription
doesn't cost you a dime.

That's an ironclad 6-month guarantee of total 100%
satisfaction.  So try Forecast & Strategies to see for
yourself the advantages I bring.  Go here now:

P.S.  I think this stock will make party chatter a lot
of fun.  Invest a thousand bucks and you could make
enough to buy a new car.  "Why the heck not?"  Click
