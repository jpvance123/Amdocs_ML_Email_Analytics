Hey Mark -- Just checking in so you don't think I have forgotten you. I will
be waiting in the black Jeep outside of Continental's baggage claim area.
If I am not right there I might be circling to placate those annoying
traffic cops.  I won't be late.  My cell is 703-587-9245.  Amanda's is
703-598-8999.  See you on Saturday!

Brad,

We may consider targeting a wide audience.  Since these turbines are not the technology of choice for many large corporate entities, our target audience may need to be somewhat more diverse.  Our only prerequisite for purchase is the ability to raise $31 MM (plus option fees).

I have two primary documents.  One is the spec sheet and a general scope.  The other is a turbine purchase agreement.

A counterparty can have two options:  One is to contact us to provide a bid.  There would be no price assurance or exclusivity in this case.  Their other choice is to accept our offer on a turbine option contract.  For $1 MM, they would have a 30 day call on the turbines, during which they would be permitted to conduct their due diligence.  The $1 MM buys them price assurance and an exclusivity period.  

It may be a nuance, but our offer price is on the call not the actual turbine.  Is this consistent with EOL's format?

Steve

Armed with a target list of purchasers, we can craft the new product pop-up to hit those companies' systems when they log on, which would give them the following information:

General description of the assets
Contact information (names & numbers)
Directions on re-filtering for the Turbine Product (which would be housed under US Power and accessible only to those pre-approved companies)

The Long Description would essentially be the turbines' Spec Sheet.  But if a counterparty clicks on the Offer, we could replace the GTC's with a Term Sheet or LOI which binds the counterparty to 30 days of diligence with a break-up fee if the deal doesn't close.  If the company isn't willing to commit to that, the contact information will be their route to getting more information.

Thoughts?
Brad

Ah-ha!

The turbines idea on EOL.  I don't want to post an advetisement only I want them to post the turbines themselves.  So essentially just like a new product launch we would have a pop up announcing a new product and the new product would be our turbines - exactly the same as any other product.  They have to post the turbines out there and obviously there will only be an offer and they will be for the ABBs we actually have in Canada.  You never know someone may click - it would be an interesting concept and probably non-binding as there would be site inspections etc.

But not an advert - actually posting the turbines.

Bob Shults and I will be attending an eNYMEX reception this Thursday, and John and Greg are still trying to coordinate a meeting with Bo and Vincent.  Short answer-- we've got it as covered as possible for now.  

Another item:  I got a call from Stephen Thome in ENA who wanted us to post something like an advertisement for your turbines on EnronOnline.  Jay confirmed that it was technically feasible to craft a pop-up that targets certain customers with information and links to documents and spec sheets.  I'm told we have resisted this approach in the past because it has the potential to get out of hand once the genie gets out of the bottle, so to speak.  I think it fits well for the turbines, but I wanted to make sure you were behind this idea before we launched into development.

I would be happy to meet with them so feel free to set something up.  We have had contact in the past with NYMEX on some of these issues and I can explain the story later.

My asistant is Tina Spiller and I am in next week (I am in London this week) so maybe we can get together and discuss.

thanks.

I recently met Robert "Bo" Collins, the new President of the NYMEX and formerly with El Paso. Bo is keenly aware that the NYMEX has fallen down in two areas--first, catering too much to the locals, while ignoring their true customer base and secondly, not following through with the eNYMEX rollout. Bo along with Vincent Viola, the new Chairman of the NYMEX are dedicated to correcting these two problems immediately. Personally, I think there is a chance that EnronOnline could partner with the NYMEX and it could benefit both. Obviously, they need us far more than we need them, but there is a window of opportunity due to the recent change in the NYMEX management. Is this something of interest and if so, should we follow up? Bo and Vince will be in Houston in late August for a NYMEX cocktail party at ROCC and I could arrange a meeting at Enron.

Global-Energy: ICE to Offer Clearing for Oil, NatGas=20

Online commodities trading market IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) announced =
on 29 August that the London Clearing House (LCH) would provide clearing se=
rvices for over-the-counter transactions of WTI crude and Henry Hub natural=
 gas once the Commodity Futures Trading Commission grants regulatory approv=
al, which is not expected before October.  LCH was the clearing house for I=
nternational Petroleum Exchange (IPE), which ICE recently bought.  Jeff Spr=
echer, ICE Chief Executive, said the clearing services could "open up new t=
rading opportunities, increase the velocity of trading, and increase compan=
ies' ability to take on new risk," according to Reuters.  A broker told Dow=
 Jones that the move by ICE was "the 'shot fired across the bow' of its lar=
ger-volume competitor NYMEX...[and] will allow ICE and IPE to compete direc=
tly with NYMEX for Brent-WTI arbitrage business," as NYMEX will begin offer=
ing Brent crude contracts on 5 September.  NYMEX also intends to launch its=
 online trading system, eNYMEX, within four to eight months.  <font color=
=3D"#0084A5">ANALYSIS:  Any trading market lives or dies on the quality of =
its clearance processes.  ICE, as one of the largest electronic trading for=
ums, is under constant pressure to offer new services, as it attempts to pu=
ll potential traders from other online ventures and traditional floor excha=
nges.  CEO Sprecher said ICE's goal was to "plug into (the already existing=
 futures market) infrastructure and develop a new paradigm for the OTC mark=
ets on some way of clearing, settling or netting," according to <i>Platts</=
i>.  NYMEX's electronic trading efforts are consistently delayed.</font>

Mike-

We visited AA yesterday in Dallas and they are going to allow Enron to compete for derivative business with them. Where do we stand with an ISDA with them? They mentioned that all the others they have in place are very generic - I don't know what our unique changes are, but if there is nothing in the works, the proper person to forward it to would be either:

Leslie Benners				Geraldine Lim
Managing Director			Principal
Corporate Finance & Banking		Corporate Finance
4333 Amon Carter Blvd			4333 Amon Carter Blvd			
Mail Drop 5662				Mail Drop 5662
Ft. Worth, TX  76155			Ft. Worth, TX  76155

Leslie is the boss, Geraldine is the one who will be responsible for trading derivatives, but is in the job only in the last month. 

Let me know, thanks...

Brad/Jay,

Based upon discussions with legal, operations and IT we have come up with a recommended solution for the customer list issue.  Below is an outline of our recommended procedure for dealing with price hosting arrangements on EnronOnline.  We will continue to hammer down the details but wanted your approval prior to implementing this process.  We would like to implement immediately after finalizing details.

1. Mark Taylor and Barbra Gray will draft a new Password Application which acknowledges third party price postings on EnronOnline.  Beginning immediately new customers will receive the amended Password Application.  

2. Mark Taylor and Barbra Gray will draft language for a customer pop up box which does the following: (1) Acknowledges the addition of third party price postings (2) requests permission to supply third party price posters with their company name (3) warrants that the acknowledging party has the authority to accept the new terms.

3. Mark Taylor and Barbra Gray will draft language for the third party GTC that amends the Password Application and ETA to cover the company who is posting that product type on EnronOnline. Before a company is able to transact on the third party product type, they will need to read and sign the GTC with third party language.  If the third party has already signed an GTC type agreement with the third party price poster, they will still see an amendment to the signed agreement which amends their Password Application and ETA to include the third party when they first try to transact.  Before the customer is able to transact they will need to read and sign the GTC amendment.  

3. Jay will put language from 2 above in a pop up window that only goes to Master Users. 

4. We will put the pop up on for at least one day and then gauge the number of response to determine how long to show pop up.  Marketing will contact as many master users as possible prior to pop up display.

5. We will distribute company names to third party price posters for profiling.

6.  When third party postings go live we will contact Master Users to inform them that they need to approve transaction status for third party product types (normal process for new product type launches).

Please let me know if this is ok.

ConfirmLogic will revolutionize the current method of confirming power tran=
sactions.  While the paperless confirmation process will generate much that=
 is positive, it also creates certain legal concerns for the power group.  =
Historically, the confirmation process has been used by the power group to =
address contractual inadequacies and ambiguities in product terms.  Confirm=
Logic is designed to confirm the basic commercial terms of standard transac=
tions.  It is not intended as a vehicle for confirming unique transactions,=
 addressing additional contractual terms or clarifying transaction terms.  =
Thus, we must employ appropriate guidelines to ensure that (1) only standar=
d power transactions are confirmed via ConfirmLogic and (2) necessary addit=
ional terms and conditions of confirmation are agreed to with a counterpart=
y prior to the implementation of ConfirmLogic with such counterparty. =20

I.=09Confirmation of Standard Transactions=20

We need to ensure that ConfirmLogic is used to confirm only standard power =
transactions.  If a transaction would  require a special confirmation templ=
ate or otherwise include special terms and conditions (e.g., an unusual pro=
duct such as 10-minute spinning reserve), such transaction is not appropria=
te for confirmation via ConfirmLogic.  There are a number of steps we could=
 take to help ensure that only appropriate transactions are confirmed by Co=
nfirmLogic.  (1) I proposed that EnPower and analogous deal entry systems i=
nclude a field where the trader designates whether the deal should be confi=
rmed by ConfirmLogic.  If the default were "No", the traders would be requi=
red to proactively designate if ConfirmLogic could be used.  Melissa Murphy=
 has indicated that the traders would strongly resist such a process.  Alte=
rnatively, Melissa and I discussed a two-step process whereby (a) we create=
 a Special Handling flag for the deal entry system so that if a trader has =
a trade with special terms and conditions, the trade is flagged and will no=
t flow to ConfirmLogic; and (b) the documentation group runs regular report=
s throughout the day listing all trades with comments added to the "Comment=
" section by the trader and pulls any trades from the ConfirmLogic website =
that require special handling (with the risk of the counterparty accepting =
the confirmation or automatic matching of the confirmation prior to the tim=
e the trade is pulled off the web.)   The success of this process would tur=
n upon adequate education of the traders and consistent monitoring by the d=
ocumentation group. (2)  According to Melissa Murphy, I believe we could al=
so code certain products types, e.g., 10 minute spinning reserve, so that t=
hey could not be confirmed by ConfirmLogic.  As new products were created, =
we would need to decide whether to code the product to allow confirmation b=
y ConfirmLogic. (3)  We could build a delay into the ConfirmLogic process t=
o ensure that the documentation group had time to review the deals flowing =
to ConfirmLogic before the counterparty can confirm the transaction.  For i=
nstance, if a deal with special terms was sent through ConfirmLogic, the do=
cumentation group could flag the transaction with the "Inquiry" status and =
notify the counterparty that the transaction should be confirmed in writing=
 to memorialize special terms and conditions.  However, CommodityLogic will=
 likely oppose this suggestion because they have marketed ConfirmLogic as "=
real time".

II.=09Additional Terms and Conditions of Confirmation
=20
=09Attached below please find the Form of Agreement Relating to Power Trans=
actions Confirmed by ConfirmLogic (the "Confirmation Agreement").  This is =
the type of document that we need to finalize with each power counterparty =
before transactions are confirmed by ConfirmLogic.  The CommodityLogic webs=
ite contains private and public folders that may be utilized by Enron to po=
st the Confirmation Agreement electronically.

=09We must be prepared to address changes in product terms and other contra=
ctual issues with each counterparty using ConfirmLogic.  Thus, we should ma=
intain a Confirmation Agreement database to track such counterparties.  We =
would need to update the Confirmation Agreements as changes to the product =
terms occur.  Moreover, as we negotiate new master agreements with such cou=
nterparties, we must be aware of the terms of the Confirmation Agreement an=
d address whether to conform the new master to the Confirmation Agreement o=
r incorporate the terms of the Confirmation Agreement into the new master a=
nd thus supersede the Confirmation Agreement. =20

=09While ConfirmLogic will post summaries of EnronOnline transactions, Enro=
nOnline transactions will not be confirmed on ConfirmLogic.  The ConfirmLog=
ic documentation makes clear that EOL transactions are posted for informati=
on purposes only will not be confirmed.  This is consistent with the direct=
ion we have been going for all EnronOnline transactions.  Janet Moore has b=
een involved in a project to discontinue the confirmation process for all E=
OL transactions with certain counterparties.   Enron will enter into agreem=
ents with certain counterparties whereby the parties agree (1) that EOL tra=
nsactions need not be confirmed, notwithstanding any terms in the underlyin=
g master agreement to the contrary, and (2) to additional terms of the tran=
saction previously captured by the confirmation process (the "EOL Agreement=
").   If we have already entered into an EOL Agreement with a counterparty,=
 we need not address EOL trades in the Confirmation Agreement.  However, if=
 we have not yet entered into an EOL Agreement with a counterparty, we can =
address all EOL issues in the Confirmation Agreement itself and thus obviat=
e the need for two separate agreements.=20

=09I look forward to any questions or suggestions you have relating to the =
issues raised in this e-mail.

Thanks,

Leslie

Armed with a target list of purchasers, we can craft the new product pop-up to hit those companies' systems when they log on, which would give them the following information:

General description of the assets
Contact information (names & numbers)
Directions on re-filtering for the Turbine Product (which would be housed under US Power and accessible only to those pre-approved companies)

The Long Description would essentially be the turbines' Spec Sheet.  But if a counterparty clicks on the Offer, we could replace the GTC's with a Term Sheet or LOI which binds the counterparty to 30 days of diligence with a break-up fee if the deal doesn't close.  If the company isn't willing to commit to that, the contact information will be their route to getting more information.

Thoughts?
Brad

Ah-ha!

The turbines idea on EOL.  I don't want to post an advetisement only I want them to post the turbines themselves.  So essentially just like a new product launch we would have a pop up announcing a new product and the new product would be our turbines - exactly the same as any other product.  They have to post the turbines out there and obviously there will only be an offer and they will be for the ABBs we actually have in Canada.  You never know someone may click - it would be an interesting concept and probably non-binding as there would be site inspections etc.

But not an advert - actually posting the turbines.

Bob Shults and I will be attending an eNYMEX reception this Thursday, and John and Greg are still trying to coordinate a meeting with Bo and Vincent.  Short answer-- we've got it as covered as possible for now.  

Another item:  I got a call from Stephen Thome in ENA who wanted us to post something like an advertisement for your turbines on EnronOnline.  Jay confirmed that it was technically feasible to craft a pop-up that targets certain customers with information and links to documents and spec sheets.  I'm told we have resisted this approach in the past because it has the potential to get out of hand once the genie gets out of the bottle, so to speak.  I think it fits well for the turbines, but I wanted to make sure you were behind this idea before we launched into development.

I would be happy to meet with them so feel free to set something up.  We have had contact in the past with NYMEX on some of these issues and I can explain the story later.

My asistant is Tina Spiller and I am in next week (I am in London this week) so maybe we can get together and discuss.

thanks.

I recently met Robert "Bo" Collins, the new President of the NYMEX and formerly with El Paso. Bo is keenly aware that the NYMEX has fallen down in two areas--first, catering too much to the locals, while ignoring their true customer base and secondly, not following through with the eNYMEX rollout. Bo along with Vincent Viola, the new Chairman of the NYMEX are dedicated to correcting these two problems immediately. Personally, I think there is a chance that EnronOnline could partner with the NYMEX and it could benefit both. Obviously, they need us far more than we need them, but there is a window of opportunity due to the recent change in the NYMEX management. Is this something of interest and if so, should we follow up? Bo and Vince will be in Houston in late August for a NYMEX cocktail party at ROCC and I could arrange a meeting at Enron.

Yes it is related to ECS.  The company is RHC Enterprise (Rob Christian).  Although we don't know that the entire $1MM relates to us.

Importance:	High

EPSC advised that we have received notice that an $83,210 lien will be filed by Fisk Electric against MFN for work relating to ECS.

Further, we have second hand information inside our team that indicates a second company may file a $1MM lien against MFN.

It is imperative that we resolve this issue.  Building financing cannot be closed with any liens outstanding.

Because we have benefited from Fisk's and any other contractors efforts in ECS contracted for by MFN; should MFN fail to resolve liens against them we will be required to clear the liens on their behalf in order to obtain financing.



While the second lien is hearsay at this point, we should reassess our risk analysis regarding our strategy of relying solely on MFN.

I have recommended to Hasan and Pete that we run an D&B and a credit check.  These services can be obtained through GSS.  I can coordinate if needed.

Kay:
 
In response to your original question, I think that a Master Netting Agreement is the way to go here.  Remember that the gas and ISDA agreements are going to be with Enron North America Corp while the EMA is with Enron Power Marketing, Inc.  
 
I will look at the rest of the agreement and provide any thoughts that I might have.
 
Jeff

FYI, Tom May is trying to put together a meeting tomorrow to discuss how to process this transaction, including getting an ISDA and a master gas contract. You may get a call from him.

Attached are documents relating to a proposed energy management arrangement with Intergen.  It contemplates financial, gas and power trading transactions (in addition to some services), so master gas, master power and an ISDA agreements are required.  Intergen is asking to see our "forms" in that regard.  We do not have a credit sheet yet (there are complications, of course).
 
Would we want a master netting agreement as well, or is that something that can be integrated into the EMA?  Some netting language is included, but I understand there is an initiative underway in that regard, so perhaps we can improve on what's here.
 
Input from the gas and financial trading side would be helpful.  Additionally, this form of document may well be a "go by" for similar transactions, so any additional commentary, suggestions, referrals to others, etc, would be appreciated. 
 
Thanks,
 
Kay

Here is my turn from Kay's draft transmitted this morning (clean and blackline).  In my estimation, this puts us very close.  Please fill in the blanks in 6.1 and 10.1.

This is still subject to InterGen and lender review and possible modification, but it looks like we are there.

Mark,
It has been a while since we last discussed the Oracle, TIBCO and BEAS contacts and what effect, if any, they will have on our e-commerce solutions that we are presenting to third parties. 
As a review the following are the basic sets of offerings:
1) Third parties (gas pipelines, gas storage companies) will post their products on the EnronOnline website.
2) EnronOnline will build a private e-marketplace, essentially an EnronOnline look-alike, for third parties. EnronOnline will host the private e-marketplace using Enron hardware on Enron's premises. (Note: a second tier to this offering will allow the same third party to cross post its products simultaneously on EnronOnline as well as the private e-marketplace.)
3) A software license giving a third party the right to use EnronOnline software but maintain the application and website on its own premises using its own hardware.
4) A software sale (selling the object or source code) of EnronOnline software to third parties.
At one point,  we were expecting a response from outside legal council. Did we ever get anything in writing? If so, would you please forward it to me.
We are very close to defining commercial terms for building several private e-marketplaces (#2 above). We need to know if certain contractual conflicts exist and if so, what freedom do we have.
Please inform us of where you stand on these points so that we can move forward with pricing these options.
Thanks.
Carl

Mark,

We have recently completed our Gas Trading Audit.  From our audit, we
identified an item to be addressed pertaining to legal's involvement in the
confimation process.  Throughout our audit, we were in contact with Jeff
Hodge; however, since our action item pertains to both physical and
financial deals, I wanted to forward this item to you for your review.
(Item D in the high priority section)

(See attached file: Natural Gas Trading.ppt)

Upon review, please let me know if you have any questions and/or comments.

Thank you,

Sharon

Steve -

Will Zamer relayed to me the information about the EDS/Enron relationship and the proposed paragraph you would like to see included in the EDS Hosting Contract.  I work with Mark Taylor's group in the EWS Legal Dept. and have been supporting the Net Works/CommodityLogic project - of which Will is a part - since I began at Enron in July, 2000. 

As you may be aware, CommodityLogic is a Net Works sub that has developed an internet based product to electronically supports the mid and back offices of trading companies - enabling the individuals within these companies to finalize back office aspects of trades (e.g., confirmations, nominations and invoicing).  The concept is to have a system that is not only one to many (e.g., Enron to its counterparties), but to also have a system that is many to many and not necessarily Enron reliant. 

The biggest stumbling block to the many to many concept is the neutrality of the server system that will hold all of the trade data so that it can be reconciled by the parties to the trade - CommodityLogic calls it the "CommodityHub."  Accordingly, CommodityLogic wants to pursue the EDS hosting agreement to bolster the neutrality of the hub and assist in marketing efforts.

I have been keeping Mark Holsworth in the loop and he has indicated an indifference as to whether we have CommodityLogic LLC or Enron Corp. sign the document.  He has, however, echoed your concern about ensuring that the hosting costs go against Enron's overall annual obligation to EDS.

So that we can accomplish both goals - neutrality and cost allocation - would it be acceptable if we pursued either (a) a side letter with EDS to reflect that this contract would count against the Enron minimum EDS commitment or (b) a short amendment to the existing agreement that would accomplish the same thing (the amendment merely indicating that web hosting services provided to Enron or any subsidiary or affiliated entity would be included in the annual EDS IS Budget for Enron)?  

I welcome your thoughts on this matter.

Thanks.

Mark

Whatever is easiest for you.  My thought would be the suggestion of a side letter of agreement would take less effort to complete than a modification to the MSA.

Mark,

After leaving your office yesterday I realized that Larry May also requested a change in the index language used for these Options/Straddles. He says that the current language does not accurately reflect how the index is calculated for Daily Options because it uses the word "average". Please see changes below which will apply to all the indexes used for these options/straddles. Let me know if this looks okay to you we would like to get these changes into the system as soon as possible.


Current:
The Index for a Determination Period shall be the average of the Daily Midpoint price published on each calendar day during such Determination Period under the heading "Daily Price Survey" in the Louisiana -Onshore South - Henry Hub section of Gas Daily, or if a calendar day is not a Business Day then the price used shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on the next succeeding Business Day. The Strike Price for a Determination Period shall be the South Louisiana - Henry Hub Index price in the "Market Center Spot-Gas Prices" section located in the first issue of Inside Ferc's Gas Market Report published during such Determination Period.

Proposed:
The Index shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on each calendar day during such Determination Period under the heading "Daily Price Survey" in the Louisiana -Onshore South - Henry Hub section of Gas Daily, or if a calendar day is not a Business Day then the price used shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on the next succeeding Business Day. The Strike Price for a Determination Period shall be the South Louisiana - Henry Hub Index price in the "Market Center Spot-Gas Prices" section located in the first issue of Inside Ferc's Gas Market Report published during such Determination Period.


Thanks,
Lindsay

Mark,

Here is the entire long description as would be modified per Larry May.  Al=
so, in regards to your concerns about the short description the reason we  =
have such a constraint on these particular options is the length of the Ind=
ex name. Let me know your thoughts on this as well. If Larry is okay with i=

Thanks,

At your request, the following is a summary of the issues related to the notice of lien that we have received from Fisk Electric.  Smith Street Land Company gave MFN a license to access Enron Center South for the purpose of installing telecommunication capabilities to and in that building.  My assumption in preparing the License Agreement was that there would be a business contract between Enron Networks and MFN covering such its as pricing, specific services, payment obligations and a prohibition against placing liens on the property.  Had I known that there would be no such business contract, I would have included the lien language in the License Agreement.  Because of this lien issue between MFN and Fisk, all of our existing License Agreements, including the MFN License Agreement, are being amended to add the lien language.

Fisk has sent us a notice of lien claiming non-payment from MFN in the amount of $83,210.00.  This document is not and does not create a lien, but rather just sets up the statutory requirements for a lien to be file in case MFN does not pay.  If a lien is filed, several negative things happen from our perspective.  First, there will be a cloud on the title of the property which will effect our ability to roll the building into a structured financing vehicle as is planned in the future.  Second, because our property has been enhanced by the work that Fisk did, we may become responsible for payment of the full amount to Fisk, plus their other related expenses.  Obviously, we want the lien issue corrected immediately and should put whatever pressure is necessary in order to get the issue resolved.

If you need further information, give me a call.

Just a quick note to give you the news.  Brenda and I had a little boy named Donald James Heelan Powell (a.k.a. Jimmy Powell) on Friday, July 27, 2001.
 
He takes after his old man and has a tremendously large head.  As a result, he had to come out the side door.  Brenda is doing well and recovering amazingly from the C-section.  
 
Jimmy is doing just as well.  If you want to take a look at a funny picture of our little guy (2 days old), go to:

 http://www.infantxpress.com/depot/30026/announcement/003692

It looks like he just caught someone stealing his parachute.

Mark I think we need to make the no response be something other than not allowing it.  Something such as:  I am not interested at this time. I do not wish to answer at this time ....  This will allow us to accept any yes and not have to worry about sending the company name if someone in the company says no.

We have just been advised by a third party that MFN laid off 40% of its work force today.

It has also been suggested that MFN has not paid any bills for 8 weeks.

This is all third hand and should be verified.

>From day one I had a problem with the counterintuitive language we have in Part 4 (f) of the Schedule about Netting.  In addition to being counterintuitive, I have a really hard time explaining it to my Mexican counterparties.

I would like to propose the language below.  I believe it leaves no room for interpretation and everybody will understand it immediately.

"The limitation set forth in subparagraph (ii) of Section 2(c) of this Agreement will not apply and any netting pursuant to Section 2(c) will apply across all Transactions under this Agreement"

	As you know, our group of attorneys within the Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department has recently grown substantially.  As a result, our space at the previously scheduled EWS Legal Conference at The Woodlands in October has become constrained, and we have outgrown our budget. Instead of having legal specialists attend the conference this year, we have scheduled a lunch on October 26, 2001 at the Doubletree Hotel from 12 to 3. We are scheduling several outside speakers to talk about current topics at the lunch. You will be getting further information from Lisa Mellencamp about the details, but please mark your calendars and plan on attending.

Peter -

Here is the Legal Outline Memorandum I prepared for the client on the IP acquisition file we discussed.  As you will see, there are a lot of issues that need to be addressed.  Once we determine who in your shop will be handling this, I can supplement the attached with hard copies of the documents that I have - which are very few.

Thanks.

Mark

Subject:	Market Risk Management Changes under New Risk Management Policy

To:	The Enron Management Committee


The Enron Corp. Board of Directors approved a new Risk Management Policy (the "Policy") on August 14, 2001, and notice has been distributed to Enron employees to announce the posting of this policy on the Enron intranet website at http://home.enron.com/resources (without market risk limits due to confidentiality).  The Policy includes a three page Executive Summary providing an overview of risk management practices for the four major types of risks addressed: (a) market risk; (b) credit risk; (c) operational risk and (d) liquidity/funding risk, and this summary is attached to this e-mail for your convenience.  The credit policy was incorporated without change, and the Transaction Approval Process and Guarantee Approval Processes were also incorporated with updating for specific approval authorities. 

This e-mail message is being sent to the Enron Management Committee to highlight some key aspects of the Company's market risk management practices which may be of interest.  

The Policy established a new Risk Management Committee, members of which are the Chief Risk Officer and any others designated by the CEO of Enron Corp.  During this transition period, existing Commodity Group Limits as of August 14th remain in effect, and Enron Business Unit Limits are assigned accordingly.  These limits may be further adjusted by the Risk Management Committee and the CEO, and your market risk managers will be working with you to review the limit structure for your business unit's activities to facilitate compliance with the Policy and your business initiatives.  RAC is currently working with Global Risk Management Operations to develop appropriate risk reporting that meets the Policy requirements and the needs of business unit management.

Summary of Changes to Market Risk Management Practices

In addition to consolidating Enron's various risk management policies and procedures into one comprehensive Policy, some substantive changes and clarifications were made to the Company's market risk management practices, as summarized below.  

1.	Increased the VaR Limit for the Trading Portfolio, providing discretion to the Enron Corp. CEO ("CEO") to allocate such VaR limits within defined parameters
2.	Established an Expected Tail Loss Advisory Limit for the Trading Portfolio
3.	Revised the Market Risk Limit Structure within each Portfolio to delegate more discretion for individual Business Unit and Commodity Group limits to the CEO and Risk Management Committee
a)   Concentration VaR Limits approved by Board of Directors 
b)   Business Unit VaR Limits approved by CEO / Risk Management Committee
c)   Commodity Group Limits for each Business Unit approved by CEO / Risk Management Committee
d)   Trader/Desk Limits approved by Business Unit Office of the Chairman


Key Points re: the Limit Structure
1.	Concentration Limits are established on 6 large buckets of commodity groups; this bucketing focuses on market indicators from a Board perspective, not according to Enron's organizational structure; 
?	1) Americas Gas, 2) Americas Power, 3) European Gas & Power, 
4) Products, 5) Financials, and 6) Emerging Businesses
o	Examples:  Americas Power Concentration Limit includes Global Risk Markets; Financials Concentration Limit includes Credit; Appendix A of the Policy lists the individual Commodity Groups comprising each Concentration Limit
2.	CEO/Risk Management Committee has discretion to allocate the Trading Portfolio VaR limit among the Enron Business Units, subject to the Concentration Limits approved by the Board
3.	Expected Tail Loss is a new risk metric, and accordingly, an advisory limit is established only at the total Trading Portfolio level; some Commodity Groups may have the measurement calculated in RisktRAC, but no limit is set
4.	Business Unit VaR Limits are to be set for each Enron Business Unit (i.e. Enron Americas, Enron Global Markets, Enron Europe, etc. - any Business Units recognized as having authority for trading by the CEO)
5.	Commodity Group Limits are now to be set at a Business Unit level, representing the individual Business Unit's authority for trading specific commodities
?	every Business Unit shall have a Commodity Group Limit for any commodities for which they are authorized to trade; 
?	these Commodity Group Limits and corresponding risk reporting will enable top management and the Risk Management Committee to quickly understand risk parameters on a "pure" commodity group basis within each Enron Business Unit;
6.	Each Enron Business Unit OOC can establish Trader/Desk Level Limits and/or related risk reporting as they require, enabling them to view their trading results the way they manage their business (i.e., the same trader may actually trade more than one commodity, and therefore wish to view risk parameters for several commodities combined, etc.)

Risk Management Benefits of Limit Structure: 1) CEO flexibility below the Concentration Limit level, and 2) individual Enron Business Units have clearly defined trading authority, enabling the Risk Management Committee to authorize business units to trade in the same commodities while strengthening risk management practices to facilitate compliance with the Board approved Concentration Limits 

Limit Monitoring and Reporting
1.	All position and VaR violations are triggered at 100% of the respective limit
2.	All Daily Loss notifications are triggered at 100% of the VaR limit
3.	All Cumulative 5-day Loss notifications are triggered at 225% of the VaR limit 
4.	Trading Portfolio limit monitoring reported to the Board
5.	Concentration limit monitoring reported up to the CEO, and at Board meetings
6.	Business Unit and Commodity Group limit monitoring reported up to the Risk Management Committee
7.	Trader/Desk Level Limits and related reporting to be established by each business unit

Overall Portfolio Structure
?	Expanded the Trading Portfolio includes all of Enron's mark-to-market trading activity, including speculative trading of PGE and ETS 
?	Merchant Portfolio does not have established limits
?	Clarified that the Capital Portfolio is to capture and manage all positions related to Enron's capital structure; the VaR limit established is a Concentration Limit for Enron stock related transactions; as other positions are captured and measured, additional limits may be established as needed
Added a new "Regulated" Portfolio for certain transportation and distribution activities (a VaR limit was established by the Board for PGE's regulated activities)
?	Added a new "Other Assets & Contracts" Portfolio to capture and manage accrual or other type of positions not otherwise captured in the other Portfolios; no limits established

Subject:	Additional Questions

Nancy,

In finishing our review of the Risk Controls Group, we have developed a few
additional questions listed below:

   What are the procedures related to NYMEX violation limits? [Hernandez, Nancy]   A COB report is run on every trading day.  The report has hard coded limits set based on Nymex limits report provided by Tana Jones (legal).   
     1.  What system is utilized in this monitoring process, and how often
are NYMEX violations monitored?   [Hernandez, Nancy]  Daily  Has there ever been any problems with this
system?   [Hernandez, Nancy]  No.  Data is captured based on Tagg deal entry attributes Could we obtain current copies of the reports that are used to
monitor NYMEX violations? [Hernandez, Nancy]   I would have to clear the issuance of the reports, but I don't think it would be an issue.   
     2.  What procedures are performed when Enron is approaching a limit? [Hernandez, Nancy]   Notification of Business Unit Risk Manager or Director.  [Hernandez, Nancy]  Report is issued daily to specific groups.   
Do traders notify you prior to exceeding a limit and do they perform
monitoring procedures too?    [Hernandez, Nancy]  I am not sure if they do their own procedures.   Who do you contact, and what is the timeline in
regards to sending a letter to the NYMEX?   [Hernandez, Nancy]  No known correspondence with NyMex Could we get a copy of any
recent correspondence with the NYMEX when Enron was approaching a limit? [Hernandez, Nancy]   No know correspondence. 
     3.  Are the procedures the same when you see a violation has occurred?  Legal to answer
What penalties are assessed for noncompliance?   [Hernandez, Nancy]  Legal to answer Have penalties ever been
incurred? [Hernandez, Nancy]   legal to Answer 

   It is my understanding after talking to Jennifer Nguyen that you
   performed a reconciliation of all of the source systems to RisktRAC.
   Additionally, she indicated that since January, any new curve added is
   notified, documented, and monitored by the Risk Controls Group.  What is
   this process?  Are there any forms utilized?  Would it be possible to
   get copies of the reconciliations performed and forms utilized, if any,
   in the addition of new curves?

   For inclusion in the AO1 Report, is it accurate that Credit inputs the
   data into Risky Business and the Risk Controls Group provides the report
   to upper management.  If not, does Risk Controls Group input these deals
   not captured in the system?  What is this process?

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at x56959.  Please
provide us responses at you earliest convenience and additionally the Risky
Business Reports Jack Ehrig previously requested.

Thank you,
Carrie

Using your numbers:
1.  No.  We won't do that until we think we have to.
2.  Not entirely, they have to meet certain more restrictive tests depending on how they are organized (i.e. how sophisticated are the investors).  A fund group like Fidelity that allows my Mom to invest has to have $1,000,000,000 in assets.  A true hedge fund that limits its investors to those meeting certain sophistication requirements only needs $100,000,000 in total assets.
3. Yes
4. Only if we become "regulated."  Currently we still maintain that we are a one-to-many site and are not yet subject to these rules.

OK - so based on this document:

1) Are we registered with the CFTC?
2) Are we prohibited from transacting with hedge funds ("investment company")?
3) Are the "exemption conditions" with which the facility must comply just the conditions listed in the document?
4) Could you clarify: Do the conditions described in the document apply to us now, or only if we become "regulated"?


As per our conversation, I understand that FX is subject to even less stringent requirements than our current commodities are. 

Thanks,

Dave

As stated below, Duke has agreed to purchase the ConfirmLogic Module.  Therefore, I need to have each respective attorney start the Amendment process for Duke to enable them to transact on ConfirmLogic.  I will be required to provide weekly updates as to the status of the amendments as stated below for management.  Let me know of any questions or concerns.

Kim,

Duke has decided to purchase all of our modules(!), so they will need a revised MTA.

Also: Greg Piper has requested that our team document the process for revising MTAs for customers purchasing ConfirmLogic. I'll also need to track where prospective customers are in the process for our weekly marketing report (only those prospects that are Beta customers and/or have become guest users). Any suggestion on the best way to get this information? 

Thanks,
Jennifer

Mark and Frank, in addition to the emails I sent to Frank about Devon and mark about PPL, here is a summary of the where we stand on some of the hot ISDA negotiations and what, if anything, needs to be done right away.

PPL Energy-- the schedule was negotiated.  Darren V. in credit and I were working to correct some errors and issues re: the guaranty.  Darren can discuss.  This is the ISDa that is ready to move and should move.  Mark, I think I forwarded to you the lastest emails from this week from Darren.  But in any case, if another lawyer can check this file and call Darren if they have any questions, he would be quick to get back to that persona and get them up to speed.

Devon - Frank and I spoke about Devon today.  The counterparty had put the file on file because Devon was too busy focusing on the acquisition of Mitchell Energy (the company built by the guy who also built the Woodlands).  Now, Devon is ready to move forward and requested a blackline.  Jason has asked that we hold off until he can review credit issues in light of the acquisition.

Welch's -- Jason Williams and I have worked on this one very closely and Jason has attended every conference call with me.  We have gone back and fault on the thresholds and Jason sent some new ones, I faxed them to the counterparty and we have not heard back from them.  I emailed Jason today to ask him to please follow-ip to ask about the thresholds. Otherwise, we have updated blacklines in the file.  I have asked several swap attorneys about questions before I moved forward but Sara has been the second point person.  Check with Jason to see if the attorney follows up -- she might be on vacation.  Keegan also has the phone number of the attorney's assistant who knows how to reach her when she is out of the office on a part time (or summer) schedule).

I have reviewed the MFN agreement and believe that should MFN fail to live =
up to its end of the Agreement our sole remedy is termination. (see section=
s extracted below).
=20
I understand from Pete Castrejana that should MFN fail to provide service w=
e have no functionally equivalent fall-back position, at least in the short=
 term.  Given this, I believe we have placed ourselves in an unenviable ris=
k position going forward.
=20
It is my suggestion that irrespective of the resolution to this lien issue =
or MFN financing issues, we reopen negotiations to obtain the right to inte=
rvene and negotiate on our own behalf with any party contracted with by MFN=
.  We should attempt to include language which contractually binds MFN to m=

Mark - This is just a short note to revisit how and when we should be using the new setoff language.  A while ago I sent you my markup of our old language and then talked to you about when we should begin using it.  At that time you said that we should wait until we all get together and discuss it.   Needless to say, because of people's schedules we have not had a group meeting since that time.  Now I'm hearing from Francisco that you have indicated that we should be using it now.  Would you please clarify if we should be using the new language in the documents we are currently sending out and, if so, what form the language should take.  Thanks.

This morning Enron was interviewed by the Federal Reserve, CFTC, SEC, and the Department of Treasury (also attending were the OCC and the FDIC).  Scott Gahn from the commercial group lead the discussion and Vicki Sharp (legal), Mark Taylor (legal) and I supported Scott on the legal and regulatory issues.
The goal in the meeting was to provide the agencies information so they can draft an interagency document on the retail swap market and its regulation by end of the year as required by the CFMA.

Going into the meeting we knew that the CFTC and the Fed were more likely to support the retail swap industry expansion, with the SEC and Treasury more interested in a regulatory structure that allows their "clients" , the banks and broker/dealers to offer the swaps and protect against systemic risk.  The agency which extended lead the meeting - in our case the CFTC.   The other firms interviewed are Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lehman, JP Morgan-Chase, Bank of America, ISDA, and Blackbird.

First, we noted that our targeted customers are the small to medium size business, not the residential consumer.  We argued that we can offer bundled retail swaps to those not meeting the eligible contract participant (ECP) requirements in deregulated markets where physically deliver is legal and possible, but unbundling the swap from the physical prohibits retail swaps to non-ECP customers.  This is a large markets (8.1 million potential mass market and small mass market customers) and the benefits of swaps to manage the volatility of deregulating markets should not be reserved to the Fortune 1,000.   The consumers would be full requirements consumers, so speculation would be managed.  If speculation and market manipulation were to occur state and common-law antifraud provisions are available.

We were able to isolate the SEC at the beginning the meeting by noting that we were not planning equity swaps.  The Treasury representative asked questions about manipulation, consumer protection, and the California situation for retail consumers.The OCC was concerned about coordination with state financial regulators and if this would be a barrier to market entry.

The USG agency officials acknowledged that the retail swaps in energy and other commodities were useful risk management products, but some disagree as the regulatory treatment. At the end of meeting, Treasury said that "do you expect us to exempt Enron solely in from regulation in offering these products?".  We said yes if we are willing to offer sound risk management products to our customers 

Best development: The CFTC official pulled us aside after the meeting and said that while Treasury may not willing to solely exempting Enron, the CFTC has the authority and is willing to consider just an exemption.  The CFTC is  interested in acting quickly to offer regulatory relief and legal certainty for those firms interested in offering these products under the ECP level.  She wants to sit down with us very shortly to decide how best to get move this at the CFTC, either through a formal rulemaking or no action letter.   The goal would be to act before the swap report is released in December, avoid legislative changes (which we strongly oppose), and allow for product innovation.

Call with any questions and I will keep you updated.

At the all-employee meeting two weeks ago, I talked about the major challenges that I believe Enron is currently facing and what we are doing to address these issues.  I also reviewed with you our vision for Enron to become "The World's Leading Company," and what that means to me.

Your management team and I remain committed to this goal and are confident that by working together, we can achieve this vision.  After the all-employee meeting, a number of you came forward to voice your concerns about what you saw as additional challenges for Enron, and for that, I thank you.  We have already begun working on many of the concerns you expressed.  Now, I would like to hear from more of you about what you see as the most critical issues facing Enron in the next twelve months.  In other words, "Lay It on the Line" for me by completing the attached survey.

I assure you that your individual answers to this survey will remain confidential.  The new Management Committee will use this information to help us identify immediate action steps to address your key concerns.  We will communicate the results to you, both positive and negative, and what we plan to do about them, as soon as we can.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help us move Enron toward its new vision of becoming "The World's Leading Company."

We need your answers no later than Tuesday, September 4, 2001.

Mark -

Did you receive this?  I sent this the other day to mtaylor@enron.com but it
was opened by an mtaylor@williard.com??  I called your office to confirm
your e-mail address and was given mark.e.taylor@enron.com.  Is
mtaylor@enron.com wrong?  That's the address I've been using for some time
now.

Dear Joe,

I do appreciate this point and assumed from the draft that this was the
reasoning.  I could reach the same conclusions if the provision in question
were in essence a cross-default provision.

As an obvious example that you provide, if a CP is suspended from a stock
exchange and this produces a default under another agreement, this should
not necessarily impact the Master Agreement.  Similarly, if a party to
another agreement is obligated (my English colleagues insist the correct
word is "obliged") to furnish a particular document and fails to do so,
thus breaching an affirmative covenant, this alone, arguably, should not
have a serious consequence under the Master Agreement.

The reason I do not concur here is that instead, this provision is in
essence a cross-acceleration, usable only if the other instrument is
actually terminated early for default.  This is already the most lenient
variant of a cross-default.  The considerations should for that reason be
different.  I see acceleration as a much more severe event that in practice
does not occur except in serious circumstances.  At least if it is in a
material amount (perhaps by meeting the cross-default threshold), it
should, in my view, have the same effect regardless of the cause.

Regards

Steve Kruft

Dear Mr. Kruft,

I appreciate your question with respect to this provision as the issues are
definitely not transparent.

There are two issues at play here (i) the ISDA Master Agreement being the
"credit" agreement for many OTC products, with certain Events of Default
having been initially drafted by ISDA committees and then bilaterally
negotiated between the parties; and (ii) the desirability to be able to
trigger
a default on the ISDA when a credit relevant event occurs under another
transaction (which is often governed by another master agreement).

The actual events of default in these other non-ISDA agreements will
include
events such as failure to pay or post margin, breach of representation and
insolvency, which are similar to events which would lead to an Event of
Default
under the ISDA.  However, some underlying lending or repo agreements may
have
events of default which seem much more relevant for a particular book of
transactions, but not as a credit event for the entire OTC book governed by
the
ISDA (e.g.  being suspended from a stock exchange).  What I have attempted
to
do is to isolate those events which would have been an Event of Default had
such transaction been a Transaction under the relevant ISDA Master
Agreement.
In this manner, should it so desire, a party may elect to negotiate
additional
broader Events of Default that would also function for ?5(a)(v), but the
vast
majority of parties who use the basic menu of Events of Default would not
find
their ISDA agreements being "cross polluted" from these other events that
were
"unforeseen" when the ISDA was negotiated.

Regards

Joe

Mark,

Hello, my name is Zach Streight and I am working in Brad Richter's group trying to monetize DealBench.   We need to add a legal disclaimer to the front of our pitch book and Brad suggested I contact you.  He thought you probably would have some standard ones on file that we could use.  If you wouldn't mind letting me know if and when you could put something together for me I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks
Zach

Julia:  We've been getting a lot of questions lately regarding EOL and energy trading.  Attached is a document that I prepared (for internal purposes) to use in answering questions from regulators, legislators and the press.  I've also attached a summary of EOL - what it is, what it isn't (not an exchange), what are the benefits to customers, etc.  Mark Taylor has reviewed these documents, which I think will provide many, if not all, of the answers put forth by the ITC in its questionnaire to Enron.  

My suspicion is that this inquiry is NOT related to the Section 201 investigation.   Vicent DeSapio, the author of the questionnaire, is in the ITC's Office of Industries, not the Office of Investigations; therefore, this looks to be a general inquiry into the state of the industry.  I will confirm, though, to be sure.

I am in the office all week. 

Thanks, Lisa

Dynegy is refusing to sign confirmations for physical power transactions entered into via DynegyDirect and is amenable to entering into an agreement similar to the EOL Consent and Amendment.  I am comfortable with this solution for physical power.  Please let me know if you would like to cover financial transactions and/or physical gas in the attached agreement as well.  I'll leave it to you to discuss with your respective confirm desks whether Dynegy is making the same objections to executing written confirmation letters.

Please give me a call at your earliest convenience to discuss this matter in greater detail.

Regards,

Leslie
