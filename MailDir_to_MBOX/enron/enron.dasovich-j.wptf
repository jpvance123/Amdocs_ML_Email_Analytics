Sorry about this gang, but my new computer messed up the e-mail list.
It's 4 am and I think I have fixed it.  Maybe.  Bear with me if you are
getting this for the second time this morning.

THE FRIDAY BURRITO=20
"...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate."=20

Everyone is getting into the act.? When I started this gig, I was the only=
=20
guy in town writing to folks like you about the power industry in=20
California.? I wrote about what=01,s new, what=01,s happening, and all the=
=20
important stuff.? This week, Governor Gray Davis decided to write his own=
=20
Burrito.? His epistle got more press than mine, but why is he muscling in o=
n=20
my turf?? Not to be outdone, PUC President Loretta Lynch released a report=
=20
which looks into every facet of California=01,s power business.? No stone l=
eft=20
unturned. I=01,m telling you, there isn=01,t enough room in this business f=
or all=20
of us.? They need to clear out.=20

With people like Herr (Hair?) Peace, Governor I=01,m-Not Mr.-Rogers Davis a=
nd=20
Let=01,s Do Lynch, who needs a Friday Burrito?? They re-define our reality =
each=20
week with mind-numbing aplomb.? For example, starting in early June, the PX=
=20
was ordered to compete for business against other Qualified Trading=20
Vehicles.? Then, two weeks later, the Energy F_hrer legislated that idea to=
=20
an early death which kept the status quo for at least one year.? This week=
=20
the PUC approved 5-year bilateral deals for PG&E and SCE, thereby opening t=
he=20
PX to competition, and emasculating the PX=01,s Block Forward Market. Zip, =
bam,=20
boom.=20

I can=01,t wait to see what next week will bring.? I hear Senator Bowen is=
=20
holding Committee hearings on re regulating the industry, and the Governor=
=01,s=20
new Energy Security Council will meet to decide six things:=20

What=01,s for lunch?=20
Who will sit at the head of the table?=20
Does anyone have good seats for next week=01,s Democratic convention?=20
Is there anyone we haven=01,t indicted yet in the power industry?=20
Who will crank up the air conditioning in this room?? It=01,s getting too w=
arm.=20

Then, they will collect data from innocent businesses under subpoena, ignor=
e=20
the facts, and publish a report.? It makes one want to take a deep breath,=
=20
and inhale the scented fumes of democracy.=20

You know, I can=01,t think about where to begin, so let=01,s start somewher=

Things on the Island of California=20
?@@@ Is there anyone left at SDG&E with a brain?=20

Well, the answer very clearly is no.? I have been astounded by repeated=20
attempts of SDG&E=01,s most senior people to ape humans, but instead they m=
imic=20
apes.=20

Consider the following.? First, they waltz their default customers into the=
=20
summer with little of no protection from price spikes in the wholesale=20
market.? Forgivable in that it is human to err.? The prices skyrocket in=20
June, and they start looking for who to blame.? =01&Must be them damn=20
independent generators,=018 say their managers.? Gary Cotton informs the IS=
O=20
Governing Board that hedging SDG&E=01,s position in the Block Forward Marke=
t=20
wouldn=01,t have made any difference.? There=01,s one nobel laureate who mi=
ssed his=20
prime.=20

Next, under pressure, they ask for help from suppliers and anyone else who=
=20
will assist the utility and their customers.? Nine offers show up at their=
=20
table, and they can=01,t choose any of them.? Again, Mr Cotton tells his fe=
llow=20
ISO Governing Board members that these things take time, and we don=01,t to=
 rush=20
since there are many legislative barriers, and, well, the surfing was good=
=20
this week so why spoil it?=20

Now they are in a panic because the Energy F_hrer is visiting old ladies=20
living in trailer parks, advising them not to pay their SDG&E electricity=
=20
bill, and to continue to operate their air conditioners.? SDG&E puts a full=
=20
page ad in the local newspaper telling everyone that SDG&E is doing=20
everything it can to lower their electric bills, including asking the ISO f=
or=20
a $250 price cap, but the public can help by calling the ISO [address and=
=20
phone number provided in the ad] and urging them to lower the cap.? I alway=
s=20
thought the location of the ISO was a State secret for security reasons.? N=
o=20
secrets in San Diego.=20

But we are not done.? No sir, we are not.? Those buffalo heads who run that=
=20
company decide they will win a gold star on their collective foreheads, and=
=20
implement one of the four resolutions passed by the Electric Oversight=20
Board.? The one they pick is to petition FERC on an expedited basis to cap =
at=20
$250, the price at which sellers may bid energy or ancillary services into=
=20
the ISO and the PX.? The primary reason is that Western power markets are n=
ot=20
workably competitive.? In other words, they want FERC to set a max price on=
=20
what generators can sell in addition to the price limit at which the ISO ca=
n=20
buy!=20

What I find most astounding about this double talk is that SDG&E continues =
to=20
collect tons of money from the sales of regulatory must run energy into the=
=20
PX.?? These are sales from their stranded assets.? Their grief hasn=01,t ab=
ated=20
their greed.=20

So, to recap, SDG&E missed the boat on price hedging, failed to win consume=
r=20
confidence in public meetings, asked for help from suppliers and did nothin=
g=20
in response, then filed at FERC to cap the sale price because the wholesale=
=20
market into which they sell (over-priced?) energy is not workably=20
competitive.? Too much time in the direct sun light.=20

Things on the Island of California=20

The PUC report released yesterday is a gem with which I have not spent enou=

Folks,

As promised, the ISO delivered to me today their description of the
super peak energy product.  I have not yet read it yet, but I hope you
do, soon, and send back to me your comments.

Questions of course can be directed to either Nancy or Jim McIntosh.

Drop dead time for your responses is Sunday, at noon.  If you snooze you
loose.

Folks,

I thought it would be a good idea to  review what we discussed
yesterday, on August 23 in Folsom at the ISO, so there is no public
misunderstanding about our discussion, or our intent.

Yesterday's meeting at the ISO, at which WPTF had many of its members
who either have generation in the State, or import power into
California, was for market participants and the ISO to discuss how to
bring more order and price transparency to the ISO's out of market
calls.  WPTF had met on its own initiative several weeks before with
members from the California PX, and APX to identify a suitable product
that would satisfy the ISO's needs during or to avoid system
emergencies.  Also, we sought a matching service of parties willing to
sell into a super-peak firm energy market with those who are willing to
purchase.

APX and CalPX responded to our earlier discussions with specific product
proposals, and presented their proposals to the group at yesterday's
meeting.  The discussions which ensued during the course of that meeting
focused on how the ISO might utilize a product/service to reduce the
manpower requirements currently needed to satisfy its out of market
telephone calls, typically on short notice, and the interest on the part
of market participants to make bids into either the APX or CalPX's
proposed system for a super-peak firm-energy product.

There were no  commitments made by any party, simply a willingness to
work together to alleviate the problems associated with finding
sufficient electric power during high demand periods with greater
transparency, more participants, and greater market efficiency.

There was no discussion of commodity prices, price fixing, or bid
strategies.

Here's the latest press release from PG&E

Proposal Uses Hydroelectric Power to Help Stabilize Energy Prices
Business Editors and Energy Writers
EDITORS: Please do not use ``Pacific Gas and Electric'' or ``PG&E'' when
referring to PG&E Corporation or its National Energy Group. The PG&E
National Energy Group is not the same company as Pacific Gas and Electric
Company, the utility, and is not regulated by the California Public
Utilities Commission. Customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Company do not
have to buy products or services from the National Energy Group in order to
continue to receive quality regulated services from Pacific Gas and Electric
Company.
SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 9, 2000--
As state swelters through long hot summers, cheap
hydroelectric power will ensure consumers pay less for electricity
Citing broad support from a coalition representing consumer advocates,
business, labor, agriculture and water interests, Pacific Gas and Electric
Company jointly filed an agreement with the California Public Utilities
Commission (CPUC) today to commit the utility's hydroelectric generating
plants to the effort to help provide needed stability in California's
fragile electricity market.
If approved by the CPUC, this settlement agreement creates a compact between
customer groups and Pacific Gas and Electric Company that would enhance the
economic and environmental benefits of the hydroelectric system for the
public. The agreement would supersede current plans for auctioning the
hydroelectric plants to third parties which were filed late last year. The
agreement calls for PG&E Corporation to retain the hydroelectric generation
system within a California-based affiliate. The other signatories to the
agreement include The Utility Reform Network (TURN), the Coalition of
California Utility Employees (CUE), Agricultural Energy Consumers
Association (AECA), California Retailers Association, Sonoma County Water
Agency, and Tuolumne Utility District.
``Parties came together to develop this proposal that will moderate prices,
and combined with the strong leadership steps taken by Governor Davis last
week, will help ensure consumers are protected from the volatility of the
market.'' said Gordon Smith, President and CEO of Pacific Gas and Electric
Company. ``We are gratified to have the support of large and small consumer
groups for this settlement.''
The power produced by these hydroelectric facilities will now be committed
to the market during the periods when the market needs it the most, thereby
reducing price volatility caused by supply shortages. Additionally, the
agreement returns 90 percent of any profits from hydroelectric operations to
customers. This sharing of revenues will act as a natural ``hedge'' for
customers against rising energy prices since, as market prices increase, so
will payments back to customers under the agreement.
``A key component of the settlement is a proposed agreement with the
California Independent System Operator (CAISO) that assures that power from
the hydroelectric assets will not be bid into the energy market in a way
that can raise power prices.'' said Nettie Hoge, executive director of TURN,
and strong supporter of the proposal.
The agreement's key components:
* Provides a revenue-sharing mechanism that returns 90 percent of profits
from the hydroelectric operations to customers
* Establishes a market value of $2.8 billion for the hydroelectric system
that can be used immediately to pay down ratepayer cost obligations
* Commits PG&E Corporation to establish a $70 million fund to enhance
environmental quality, water quality, and recreational opportunities
* Commits PG&E Corporation to donate or protect through conservation
easements approximately 140,000 acres of watershed lands for public use
* Honors all existing water agreements with downstream users
* Protects agricultural uses of the water
* Ensures the facilities will continue to be operated by a highly qualified
union workforce
``This settlement benefits both California consumers and PG&E's employees,''
said Jack McNally, Business Manager of IBEW 1245. ``Consumers will be
assured that hydroelectric plants will continue to be operated by the same
dedicated employees, will continue to provide low cost reliable energy to
California consumers, and will continue to be owned by a California company.
IBEW 1245 represents the union members who operate and maintain the
hydroelectric system.
``This agreement represents a fair valuation of the hydroelectric system,''
said Michael Boccadoro, director, Agricultural Energy Consumers Association,
``this agreement also protects the long-standing beneficial relationship
between the hydro operations and the agricultural users in the state.''
The settlement agreement filed at the CPUC will be subject to public
hearings and review under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
Interested parties will be able to provide comment prior to any CPUC
decision. Also, the hydroelectric system transfer requires approval from the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).
``The CEQA review process itself will ensure that there are no significant
environmental impacts as a result of this transfer,'' said Gordon Smith.
``In addition, keeping the hydroelectric facilities and associated watershed
lands together protects the public interest in these assets.''
The system includes 174 dams, 68 powerhouses, 360 miles of canals, tunnels,
and flumes, and approximately 140,000 acres of watershed land. The
hydroelectric system has a capacity of 3,896 megawatts, and provides a
clean, renewable, low-cost source of electricity particularly during periods
of high demand. The system currently delivers about 5 percent of
California's yearly electricity needs, and up to 10% of the State's
electricity demand during hot, summer days.
``We have enjoyed a positive working relationship with the folks at PG&E for
many years,'' said Tim McCullough, manager of the Tuolumne Utilities
District. ``This agreement ensures the water resource will continue to be
managed in a way that protects the interests of Tuolumne County residents.''
This agreement differs substantially from the transfer contemplated through
legislation at the end of August last year. The 1999 Legislative proposal
did not include the price stabilizing revenue sharing mechanism. Although
the 1999 legislative package ultimately failed to achieve consensus because
of the immense complexities of balancing interests through legislative
compromise, this year's regulatory filing fulfills the directives of the
1996 restructuring legislation and provides the kind of public and state
environmental review that will forge consensus.
PG&E Corporation, with 1999 operating revenues of almost $21 billion and
operations in 21 states, markets energy services and products throughout
North America through its National Energy Group. PG&E Corporation's
businesses also include Pacific Gas and Electric Company, the Northern and
Central California utility that delivers natural gas and electricity to one
in every 20 Americans.

Folks,

Late Friday afternoon Ziad called me.  The ISO Governing Board earlier
the same day turned down the ISO management's request to force SCs to
place 95% of their scheduled load in the DA market.  That leaves the ISO
little choice but to venture into the energy markets to procure power to
cover their peak hours on hot days.

Terry gave Ziad the OK to proceed with placing both the APX and
California PX screens for this new product/matching-service.  I am
working with the two vendors and the ISO to make this happen quickly.
We anticipate that the market will open on Tuesday, September 5, or
earlier.

Key people who you may need to contact:
ISO - Ziad Alaywan  916-351-2140 (Nancy Traweek and Jim McIntosh are
also in the loop)
PX - Ken Czarnecki 626-537-3123
PX - John Yurkanin 626-537-3124
APX - Denice Cazalet 408-517-2123
APX - Michael Heinrich 408-517-2159

Please feel free to contact me with your questions.  Several of you have
not had the opportunity to attend the pre-design meetings we had at the
California PX and APX a few weeks ago, nor were you aware of the joint
WPTF/ISO meeting held last week.  But in essence, what this
product/matching-service will allow you to do is post bids to sell, or
buy a 6-hour block of capacity at a firm energy price across the hours
of HE13 to HE18.  You can bid at COB, Mead, PV, SP15 or NP15.  You can
utilize either the CalPX or APX to post your bids, because the ISO will
be watching both screens.  The block sizes are (supposed to be) 25MW.
The seller is responsible for arranging transmission to the delivery
point, and the buyer (e.g., ISO) is responsible for arranging
transmission service from the delivery point.  The ISO will make its
purchase decisions for the day-of at or before 8:00 a.m.  The ISO will
send out a general notice when it needs offers to sell on the super-peak
market.  I expect that bids for either buy or sell will be able to be
posted at any time, 24 hours.  The screens should allow parties to post
buy or sell bids at least 60 days forward of the trade day.

You are not limited to a price cap in these markets, but the ISO as a
buyer has the right to not purchase at prices above it's price cap.

I think WPTF members should be very proud that we were able to quickly
work together, and with the ISO to create this market. I have no doubt
the ISO will be offering bids to purchase starting Sept 5, and going
forward 60 days.  However, who among you will be willing and able to
post bids to sell?

 THE FRIDAY BURRITO
"...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate."

=01&Are those folks smoking crack?=018 he asked in an outrage.  My friend, =
Ol=01,
Dave in Houston, has trouble understanding the workings of our power
business here in California.  In fact, so do I.  Yesterday=01,s Joint
Senate/Assembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing to
improve either Dave=01,s or my understanding of the national embarrassment
California is perpetrating with electricity deregulation.

=01&The next thing you know, they will be taking property, and forcing
utilities to build power plants and transmission,=018 he mused between sips
of Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers.  =01&Come to think
of it, Dave, they did say something about that. Yeah,=018 I recalled,
=01&Senator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing the
ISO or the utilities to build peakers, and not let the market build
them.  I can=01,t remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOB
Chairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into State
agencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board.=018

I know what you are thinking right now.  The next thing you know
California will have regulated retail rates.  That recipe should be out
of the PUC=01,s oven sometime next week.

=01&Well, the power marketers are jigging the system, bidding up to the
ISO=01,s bid cap.   There is no way you can tell me that a generator
planned to make $750/MWH in its pro forma,=018 Dave added. =01&So you agree
with Herr (Hair) Peace!  You don=01,t believe in markets,=018 I retorted. =
=01&Oh,
I believe in them, but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW trade,
and without any notice or advanced warning, the price in the Midwest
market went against me,=018 Dave recalled.  =01&I called everyone who I tra=
ded
with, and they had nothing.  I finally called XXXXX, and I asked what
will it cost for 50 MW?=018

=01&Why didn=01,t you ask for 300?=018 I wondered.  =01&I didn=01,t want to=
 show him my
position.  You get hosed when you show the buyer your position.  Ask for
50, first,=018 Dave chided.

=01&What happened?=018 =01&Oh, they offered to sell for $150/MWH.  I said I=
=01,d
take it, and then said I needed another fifty.  He asked $300.  I took
that, and he priced the next 50 MW at $600,=018 lamented Dave.  =01&He just
wanted to see how far he could push me. That=01,s what I mean when I say
the traders are jigging it.=018

=01&But Dave, you old communist, your forgetting the trading function is
what mitigates the risk. The traders are the in between people who guess
at the price.  Sometimes they guess right, and sometimes they guess
wrong.  But the damage, or the reward, is on their book, not passed on
to the ultimate consumer. It has nothing to do with the marginal cost of
a generating plant.=018

And there you have it.  Put in a price cap, and the traders have a
target for which to shoot.  I can=01,t prove the following, yet, but I=01,l=
l
wager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down, the average
trading price climbs even as the so-called =01&dysfunctional=018 price spik=
es
are eliminated.  Consumers get hosed, and the fundamental economic
principle is upheld, which is, one can never be made better off with the
imposition of an additional constraint.

I feel better already.  Here is what is on our short agenda this week.

>>> Things in the Mailbag

>>> Things in the People=01,s Republic of California
 @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report
 @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings
 @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market

>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)

>>> Things in the Mailbag

It has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch.
Here is what my friends have been writing me.

FPL Energy=01,s Steve Ponder was only too quick to tell me, =01&Please Gary=
,
no more whining about your computer.   How old are you?? Is this the
year you get the AARP letter??? A very depressing moment.  Do you really
not know how to spell Morro Bay???  Please let us know what is going on
with your son's hockey team?? Don't forget the cigars for Moron???
Bay!!!!=018

It is good to have friends like Steve.  They make the pain of separation
so much easier. And Steve, when you FPL guys get that Entergy merger
sorted out, in a dozen years or so, you let us know. I want to
participate in the name selection for the new entity.  How about
Fentergy PLus?

Next, from the PX=01,s Mark Hoppe, who writes, =01&As you've heard from
others, I don't know quite how you manage to knock out all this material
each week. The burrito is informative, humorous and usually contains a
sprinkle of irony, tragedy (ISO Drama).  Though you are usually neutral
regarding the PX, you are not unduly negative which I appreciate.  I
think we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in the
industry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX to
successfully open this market.=018

Thanks, Mark.  I just want you to know that my ability to write this
stuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence.  I have
learned from watching Herr (Hair?) Peace, that as long as you can talk
(write, too) fast, and have conviction in your statements, regardless of
how groundless they may be, you will have a willing and eager audience.

A few weeks ago, I received from the PX=01,s Jennifer Sherwood a note,
which she wants you to know are her opinions, not necessarily the PX=01,s.
It=01,s okay, Jennifer.  I paid George,yesterday, the $20 I owed him for
that sham Rose Bowl bet, (remember?, Stanford lost) and your opinions
are cool with us.  =01&Just curious - has anyone been comparing high
unleaded prices to high CA electricity prices?  What I mean is, we are
up in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diego
consumer who can't afford to keep the AC on. But what about the inflated
unleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last few
months?  No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer from
how much it costs to fill their gas tank.  No mention is made of those
who can't afford to drive to the grocery store because they can't afford
the extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon.  The costs are passed along to the
consumer without pause.  Granted there are differences between the
unleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-side
responsiveness, but then again is it that much different to say, =01+I
can't drive today because gas is too expensive=01,
vs. =01+I can't turn up the AC today because it's too expensive.=01,=018

Finally, from one of our [secret] Washington readers, and I am not
telling who, I received the following: =01&I ... broke down and listened to
the [ISO Governing Board] discussion and vote.  Ugh!  I too noted that
the "speak fast" was applied to everyone but Herr Peace.  My goodness,
what a mess we have.  I loved Jerry's picture in USA Today -- it spoke
volumes.  My sources at FERC tell me, though, that we should keep an eye
out for {FERC Chairman] Hoecker to do something really ... [Censored]
... for political reasons.  Given no Commission meetings til September,
the only way to act is by unanimous consent, so I would hope he can't do
all that much.=018

>>> Things in the People=01,s Republic of California
 @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report

Several of you people commented to me that the ISO=01,s reply to the
PUC/EOB report was very good.  I decided to excerpt the best sections of
it for the Burrito.  The full document can be found on the ISO=01,s
website.

=01&... the [PUC/EOB] Report asserts that the suspected activities of
certain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading to
the Bay Area blackouts the following day. In fact, the events of June 13
and June 14 were completely independent of one another. The voltage
instability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone
-- exceptionally high loads, insufficient generation in the specific
local area, and transmission constraints that prevented the import of
generation from outside the area.

=01&The Report states that the ISO =01&never tried=018 to call upon consume=
rs to
reduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts. In fact, the ISO
had in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed to
reduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program, under
which customers have agreed, through a prior solicitation, to curtail
energy use in exchange for a fee

=01&The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by
=01+purchasers=01, of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $=
1.2
billion in the month of June alone). These assertions leave one with the
mistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid by
the UDCs and/or passed through to customers. However, in determining the
total cost of energy, one must determine the impact of any forward
contracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energy
markets. These contracts, which are designed to =01&lock-in=018 a specific
price in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities, are
specifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility, and
are standard in all commodities markets. We have reason to believe that
some of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of the
recent price spikes.

=01&In a similar vein, the reports asserts that California =01&might well=
=018
have saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place in
May and June. This assertion assumes that all energy purchases would
have been made at or below the $250 bid cap. In fact, during times of
peak demand, when all of the state=01,s generation has been exhausted, the
ISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation. In order
to secure the necessary power, the ISO must purchase, on a bilateral
basis, this energy from resources located outside of the ISO=01,s control
area.

=01&The Report asserts that California power markets =01&are not now
competitive=018 and implies, erroneously in our view, that this is the
normal state of affairs. It is not. The Market Surveillance Committee
has noted that =01&market power in the California energy market appears to
arise
primarily during periods of peak demand,=018 and warned that demand growth
would increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000.

=01&The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interested
board and not to the citizens of California. This simply is not the
case. The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act and
to the rules and regulations of FERC, which dictate, in part, that
wholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the public
interest. The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed and
approved by FERC. Every change to our market design and virtually every
aspect of the ISO=01,s business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC.
The FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by the
state agencies and such agencies have, in fact, been active participants
in the FERC proceedings.

=01&The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affected
by restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have made
California more vulnerable to supply shortages. This assertion is
unfounded. Significant load growth in California and neighboring states
coupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in both
generation and transmission have caused this vulnerability.
Restructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold.
Only by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval and
siting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements will
this significant shortage be addressed.=018

>>> Things in the People=01,s Republic of California
 @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings

If you want to imagine a scary sight, imagine, then, twelve California
legislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongs
of electric restructuring.  Also imagine, as if you are in the Twilight
Zone, witnesses that are slow on their feet, and reckless in their
facts.  Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=01,s Joint Senate/Assembly
hearing was like.

It started over two hours late.  The Senate was busy congratulating one
of their own who is term-limited out next session, and they wanted to
heap on the glory.  That said, the show began with CEC Commissioner Bill
Keese.  Mr. Keese has one story, and regardless how well he tells it,
and he does, it is always the same story.  It is the heat storm story.
One can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is a
single-mom, call her Lady-Bird Bowen, who travels across an angry land
with her precocious pre-teen child, Stevie Wonderboy.  They are
searching for electric power plants in the dessert, which, by the grace
of God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberal
returns on investment.

Being the first speaker, Mr. Keese took at least half the heat (storm)
of the day.  The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable.  Last week, San
Diegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system, and did
not receive one penny of compensation (I=01,m not making that up ... He
said it).  He is sick of hearing about demand management as being a
solution for the problem over the last five years, and he is about done
listening.  People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden price
hikes.  Yikes!

Keese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7%, but
in neighboring Arizona, the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!!  Mr. Keese
correctly pointed out that electric power is not solely a California
problem, it is a regional problem.  One member of the Committee asked
what the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting and
construction process?

Keese referred to Governor Gray Davis=01, Executive Order issued last week
to which the CEC plans to respond soon, date uncertain, that lays out a
6 month permitting time line.  The six months are enough if the
applicant has the land secured, zoning okayed, transmission access, and
air offsets.  Hmmmmmm.  That alone might take six months before you get
to the CEC.

The next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB, and Ms. Lynch.  I went too
hard on her last week, calling her Let=01,s Do Lynch.  That was a 0.8 TPC.
Sorry.  I promise to be nicer starting now.  The Energy Fuhrer
instructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert the
pass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunction
of the market is cured.  Put it in an escrow account.  Ms Lynch promised
to review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enact
SDG&E rate caps (told you).

The star of the day, I thought, was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith.
Mr. Smith comes to Sacramento.  Isn=01,t that a switch?  Mr. Smith came in
place of Mr. Hoecker, thank the Lord.  Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese what
these 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way.
The 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare the
wholesale market as non-competitive, and then ask the generators to give
back the money they over collected.  When can we do that?  Mr. Smith
answered as only a FERC attorney can answer.  There is a process.  It
takes time.  You must have evidence.  FERC uses a three-part criteria
for assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable.  It=01,s
based on market concentration and dominance, not the existence of high
prices.  You would have to sue FERC in federal court, and the best you
could hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand from
the US Court of Appeals.

Slowly, the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12.  They were
stumped.  Herr (Hair?) Peace screamed, couldn=01,t you, Mr. Smith of FERC,
today use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive, that
generators who had market based rates have exercised market power, and
retro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the Western region?
Like a wheezing accordion, Mr. Smith played back and forth the familiar
strains of music, like a solo street musician on the corner.  Back and
forth: the process, the process, the process.  There have been times in
the past I hated the process at FERC.  Today, I have a renewed respect
for what process affords me and you ... Freedom from the tyranny of a
mob.

For the remainder of the hearing, they focused on remedies that could be
undertaken by the PUC.

>>> Things in the People=01,s Republic of California
 @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market

Well, the official title is, =01&Order Instituting Investigation into the
Functioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact on
Retail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas &
Electric Company=018.  I like my title better.

This Order, or OII was issued at the last business meeting of the
Commission, on August 3.  It calls for an investigation of the wholesale
markets, responses from the three UDCs, and a pre-hearing conference in
San Diego on August 29 at the San Diego Convention Center.

Here are the questions the PUC wishes us to address:

=01=07 What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a=
nd
small commercial customers? (What does this have to do with the
functioning of the wholesale market?)

=01=07 Should SDG&E be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts or
other supply procurement activities? How should the Commission assess
reasonableness?  Are SDG&E=01,s purchasing activities serving its customers
on just and reasonable terms?

=01=07 What is SDG&E=01,s obligation to minimize energy costs for its curre=
nt
customers?

=01=07 How should the Commission, Attorney General, EOB, ISO and PX
coordinate to investigate wholesale market events, behaviors, and
irregularities?  How should state/federal concerns be addressed?

=01=07 What are the causes of the price increases?  Are anticompeititve
practices causing some of the price increases?  Are there mechanisms the
Commission can employ to make ratepayers whole?

The object of humor notwithstanding, and seeing how the flow of new
material has slowed a bit, my wife provided this week=01,s laughter.  She
didn=01,t have to attend the Senate hearing.

Subject: The Brilliance of Women

There were 11 people hanging onto a rope that came down from a
helicopter.  Ten were men and one was a woman. They all decided that one
person should get off because if they didn't the rope would break and
everyone would die.

No one could decide who should go so finally the Woman gave a really
touching speech saying how she would give up her life to save the
others, because women were used to giving up things for their husbands
and children and giving in to men.

All of the men started clapping.

I have received several comments about the WSJ data request.

Enron's Tim Beldon wrote me that he would consider it.  The PX's Gene
Waas was concerned based on previous experiences of letting data go to
the WSJ.  I talked with Dynegy's Lynn Lednicky this morning and he
suggested that the PX has aggregated data for several days, and that
releasing the aggregate data with individual bid data from our members
would give the WSJ a better window into the issues.  That is, simply
releasing your bid data will not tell the WSJ anything of value.

I know that Rebecca would insist that the dates for which any data are
polled our at her choice, not ours.  It must be necessary to assure
there is no possibility of bias.  I am wondering if the PX would be
willing to assist us by putting together aggregate data for days which
the WSJ selects, and then give us the opportunity to release our
individual data for the same days?


I am also wondering if we shouldn't have an off-the-record
teleconference call with the WSJ whereby both sides can get a better
understanding of what the WSJ wants, and how we can best provide it.
Would anyone be interested in me setting up such a meeting for next
week, say Wednesday or Thursday?

THE FRIDAY BURRITO
"...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate."

There is a hint of Autumn in the air.  I don=01,t know if it=01,s wishful
thinking, or if the seasons are really beginning to turn from our pale
summer into a Bay Area glorious Fall.  It=01,s premature, I know.  A few
fallen leaves, the start of schools, slightly longer afternoon shadows
... I=01,m jumping the gun.  I can=01,t wait for this summer to be over,
especially this summer.  The pounding never stops, and as I hear the din
of the cash register ringing with each climb in Southwest temperature, I
can barely keep track of all the hiccups which drive prices up: fires in
Montana restricting transmission paths, blown up interstate gas pipeline
in New Mexico, diminishing N-Ox credits for in-state power plants,
depleted inventory of hours of voluntary load interruptions for
commercial and industrial customers, credit limits restricting imports
of Canadian power into the Northwest and California, and BPA buying
about 1,000 MW to cover its short hydro position.

 I also get the willies every time another politician lambastes the
California restructured power industry.  I just want to end to the
summer, now, and start a two week Fall vacation ... anywhere, even in
Cleveland.

There are seven, count them, seven investigations into some aspect of
the wholesale power market out here.  Two days ago there were only six,
but FERC just added another yesterday in response to the Prez=01,s
request.  That means FERC has two, the PUC has two, the State Attorneys
General has two (one on the ISO Governing Board, and one on the in-state
generators), and one by the Electric Oversight Board.  If you don=01,t have
an ongoing study of the California Market, then you=01,re not hip.

All of these investigations, save FERC=01,s Section 206 Investigation, are
going to amount to near nothing.  A lot of wasted time and paper.  The
PUC and EOB studies have their conclusion sections all finished.  Now
they need some evidence to support their assertions.

And how are we holding up under all of this?  How are you doing?  I talk
to many of you throughout the week, and I know how frustrated you are.
I share your frustration.  You want to tell the public, the press, and
anyone in between the truth.  You want to lay out the facts.  You want
to show anyone who will listen that each interference into the market is
making things worse, not better.  The price caps, for example, are
damnable and screwing up the prices, much to the detriment of those
people for who price caps were supposed to be a protection against price
shocks.  Now they are receiving higher average prices.

The public isn=01,t going to listen to anything longer than a sound bite.
And let=01,s face it, when it comes to stellar public relations, our
industry is not known for turning in A+ performances, except for SCE.
Those guys seem to get their story in front of the public at every
turn.  I heard SCE is putting on their customers=01, bill, =01&Here is what
you would have paid if the rate freeze ended ....=018.  But many of us in
the new power industry, borne from the loins of either the natural-gas
industry or nuclear-power business, learned the hard way that the best
response to a public inquiry is a two-block head start in front of an
angry mob.  Keep your head down, shut your mouth, and this too shall
pass.

I don=01,t buy that approach, at least not anymore.  That is, I don=01,t
believe we have anything to hide, or of which to be ashamed.  What
electric restructuring is about is correct, beneficial to the public,
and in everyone=01,s best interests.  Look at it this way, when they pat
the last shovelful of dirt on your final resting place, for what do you
most want to be remembered?  That you caved in to the political will of
others, or at a moment when you had the chance, you did what was right
instead of what was expedient?  I think the choice is easy, albeit laced
with sheer terror.  Those bland homilies I so diligently teach my kids
(e.g., tell the truth, do what is right, think of the big picture and
not just yourself) are a lot easier to speak than to live by.  So join
me and stand up for what you believe.  They can=01,t take away your pride,
not yet.

Here is this week=01,s line up.

 @@@ Excerpts from FERC=01,s Order on SDG&E Complaint

President Clinton commented from the Rose Garden that good folks in San
Diego, retired, fixed-income, likely to vote for a Democrat, are making
choices between buying medicine or air conditioning their homes.  I call
this the Del Monica Beach lecture.  The Prez instructed the FERC to
investigate the situation in California, and FERC wasted no time.

In response to SDG&E=01,s August 2 complaint, whereby the utility asked
FERC to impose a $250 price cap on generators in the region, the FERC
responded in a way that I was hoping to see several months ago.  The
FERC slammed SDG&E on their complaint for lack of merit, and the FERC
also initiated an FPA Section 206 Investigation into the wholesale power
market in California.

Here are some of the juicy excerpts from FERC=01,s Order:

=01&In this order, ... , we are denying SDG&E's requested immediate
imposition of a price cap on all sellers in California.  However, we are
instituting consolidated hearing   proceedings pursuant to section 206
of the Federal Power Act to investigate the justness and reasonableness
of the rates and charges of public utilities that sell energy and
ancillary services to or through the California ISO and PX, and to also
investigate whether the tariffs and institutional structures and bylaws
of the California ISO and PX are adversely affecting the efficient
operation of competitive wholesale electric power markets in California
and need to be modified

=01&SDG&E concludes that the markets cannot be workably competitive if
sellers are able to exact prices that are considerably above levels that
would prevail in open competition, i.e., sellers are able to bid and
receive prices significantly above their marginal costs.  SDG&E also
argues that the hour-to-hour volatility in imbalance energy prices and
the erratic clearing price for ancillary services is an indication that
the market is breaking down when it is moderately stressed.

=01&While we find it appropriate to institute a section 206 hearing on
these issues, we cannot implement an immediate price cap of $250/MWh as
requested by SDG&E because there is no record before us to support such
an action.  ...  While the issues raised by this complaint are
important, the Commission has no basis to conclude that SDG&E's proposal
to place an immediate, arbitrary $250/MWh cap on the price that every
public utility seller of energy and ancillary services may bid into the
PX and ISO markets would satisfy this standard.  SDG&E has provided no
evidence to demonstrate that all potential sellers are able to exercise
market power, has not documented a single instance of a seller
exercising market power during times of scarcity, and did not attempt to
show that the conditions underlying the Commission's approval of
market-based rates for public utility sellers of energy and ancillary
services have changed.  Nor did it address specific market or
institutional  factors that may be causing rates to be unjust or
unreasonable.

=01&SDG&E asserts that the ISO's congestion management and market
structures are flawed and in need of overhaul. ... Furthermore, SDG&E
expresses its concern that, for a number of reasons, the congestion
management and market reform efforts being pursued by ISO stakeholders
will not produce  meaningful results.  SDG&E indicates that it is
prepared to work with the ISO to develop alternative reform proposals;
however, SDG&E's complains that the ISO stakeholder process has, in
SDG&E's judgment, been ineffective with respect to these issues.

=01&Various interveners contend that SDG&E's arguments are premature. ...
We agree with Interveners. ...  The reform efforts have been the subject
of extensive public review and comment and are nearing completion.
Accordingly, we reject SDG&E's arguments at this time.

=01&It is unclear whether SDG&E's failure to purchase hedging instruments
for its retail operations is due to state regulatory policies or its
business decisions.  A retail rate design that exposes consumers to the
volatility of commodity prices would be extraordinary, particularly when
consumers do not have the ability to receive or respond to price
signals.

=01&We are concerned that ... increasing level of market activity in the
real-time market raises significant reliability and economical concerns.
...  Historically, the ISO procures on a daily basis only the resources
needed for the operating day.  Not only does this procurement practice
put pressure on the grid operator to secure needed resources at the last
minute, but the practice is uneconomical.  Such spot-market purchases
are not subject to the ISO's  buyer's cap.  Furthermore, because the ISO
is the supplier of last resort for these services, when OOM calls are
made, suppliers realize that the ISO is in a must-buy situation.

=01&In an effort to address this problem, we direct the ISO to immediately
institute a more forward approach to procuring the resources necessary
to reliably operate the grid.  Specifically, the ISO should anticipate
the need for such additional resources based on  forecasted peak
periods.  We direct the ISO to factor these reforms into an analysis of
the need for and level of purchase price caps and to include this
analysis as support for any filing it makes to extend its purchase price
cap authority.=018

In closing, WPTF is an intervenor in the case, and we hope to be very
active in the case through testimony, cross examination, the filing of
briefs, and reply briefs.

>>> Things in the People=01,s Republic of California
 @@@ The Development of a Super-Peak Block Energy Product

Several weeks ago, I discussed with the ISO their interest in developing
a new market for a block energy product that would be purchased in the
morning of a trade day, and be dispatched during the super-peak hours.
I challenged them to let the market participants develop this market
instead of the ISO doing the same.

At the August 1 ISO Governing Board meeting, I stated as the WPTF
position that we oppose price caps, but if the ISO Governing Board
insisted on going down the $250/MWH price cap route, we would do what
ever we could to help the situation and avoid the occurrences of Stage 3
alerts.  Whereas I didn=01,t think about the conversation on super-peak
block markets as being relevant to  the remarks before the Governing
Board, it became painfully clear soon after that we could, and should
work with the ISO to develop a new market through either APX or the
California PX, or both, to bring some order to the otherwise chaotic Out
of Market system.

This week, WPTF and the ISO had a joint meeting whereby both sides
discussed the merits of a super-peak block firm-energy product, and how
it could be instituted.  The meeting at the ISO, at which WPTF had many
of its members who either have generation in the State, or import power
into California, was for market participants and the ISO to discuss how
to bring more order and price transparency to the ISO's out of market
calls. The ISO reported that this summer, to date, the amount of money
spent on Out of Market purchases was about $100 million.  Last year the
total cost of Out of Market purchases was $1.7 million.

APX and CalPX, in response to our earlier discussions with them,
presented their proposals at the meeting.  The discussions which ensued
during the course of the presentations focused on how the ISO might
utilize a product/service to reduce the manpower requirements currently
needed to satisfy its out of market telephone calls, typically on short
notice, and the interest on the part of market participants to make bids
into either the APX or CalPX's proposed system for a super-peak
firm-energy product.

There were no  commitments made by any party, simply a willingness to
work together to alleviate the problems associated with finding
sufficient electric power during high demand periods with greater
transparency, more participants, and greater market efficiency.

We=01,ll keep you posted on our development of this market.

>>> The Mailbag: A Letter from My Friend, and A Response

Sometimes I share bites of our Burrito with fellow travellers, much as I
did last week when I sent my friend Mike Florio a copy of the story
called the Trial of Gow Jing.  Mike sent me a note that I would like to
share. He said I could.  I want you to read it and appreciate that there
are other people who share his view.  I also copied the response I sent
to Michael, a.k.a. Old Deuteronomy.

Michael wrote:

=01&I'm not going to attempt to complete your little melodrama [the
Gow-Jing story], but I did want to offer an observation.  In simpler
times, people knew the other people that they did business with, and
they typically lived in the same community.  If a merchant tried to
charge exorbitant prices for his products, even if he was the only one
in town who had the product in stock, he would face the wrath of his
fellow citizens.  This undoubtedly served as a constraint on such
behavior, even in the absence of a CPUC or FERC. Telling Mrs. Jones that
the loaf of bread she needs to feed her kids will cost her $50 would not
be a pleasant way to do business, and such things ordinarily did not
happen.

=01&In the modern global economy, of course, this personal aspect of doing
business has been almost completely lost.  And so has the restraint.  I
have no doubt that the folks who sell electricity are good people (jeez,
I know many of them), but they work in an environment where the end
results of their business decisions are invisible.  If Mrs. Jones can't
afford to run her refrigerator any more, that fact is at best dimly
perceived, and if so it is viewed as cause for some sort of social
program, not a reason why a merchant would alter his behavior.

=01&This is clearly not a case of socialism versus capitalism, because both
scenarios occur within the overall context of a capitalist system.  But
certainly something fundamental has changed, and not for the better in
my view.  Now everyone feels compelled to squeeze the last dollar out of
every transaction-- their jobs may even depend upon it-- and no one is
responsible for the end result.  Is this the kind of world we want to
live in???

=01&PUT THAT IN YOUR BURRITO AND SEE WHAT YOUR READERS SAY!  YOU CAN EVEN
BLAME ME, SO THAT YOU ARE NOT ACCUSED OF TURNING PINK IN YOUR MIDDLE
AGE.      Deut=018

Okay.  It=01,s in the Burrito.  And here is what I think.

You allude to the change in a world that was once =01&more personal=018 and=
 is
now institutional.  You make the point that things are not better off if
for no other reason then the lack of personal accountability.  But I
don=01,t think that in all cases the more personal world is lost.  It is
ever present, as I will argue below.  Second, your group embraces the
impersonal =01&efficiencies=018 when it is convenient.  Finally and most
importantly, where will your social-minded and like minded counterparts
be when competitive forces leap supply ahead of demand, which might
happen in a handful of years?

However, your essential point is not lost on me.  I do believe that
there are ways for generators and consumers to be good neighbors in
California.  I have a proposal below to which I would like to hear your
response.

First, though, the personal business touch is present in our economy.  I
exercise the restraint to which your story pines in many of my
consulting engagements which require financial give and take between
client and vendor.  It is simply smart business to do so.  I have been
the beneficiary of the same with my local bank when errors occurred in
my checking accounts, or when loan payments were made absent mindedly
late, etc., and the late fee forgiven.  However, much of our economy,
and certainly the trade of a commodity such as electricity requires the
use of markets.  Nameless and faceless, they do squeeze out all the
efficiencies which lead to lower prices, more innovation, and a sharing
of price risk with parties who are neither the ultimate consumer nor the
initial producer.  The producer and consumer get out of the risk
arbitrage and leave it to others who are more skilled and monied.

I find it ironic that TURN, then, is so insistent on arguing, as it has
done on many many occasions for the relaxation of market separation in
the ISO=01,s congestion management reform.  Elimination of market
separation is nothing more than the impersonal forcing of parties to
execute trades on either side of a congested transmission path in the
name of market efficiency.  Lower prices for consumers.  Does it really
matter if it is done through person to person transactions, or through
markets?

Third, your story can be used to make an alternative point.  What
happens to the merchant in town when Wal-Mart moves into the next town
down the road?  All the faithful customers that your Merchant of
Vengeance was protecting suddenly migrate to a competitor with greater
inventory, more choice, and lower prices.  What do you say, then?  The
corollary for us is direct.  The new generation owners moved literally
billions of dollars into California, at risk, and took a chance.  It
paid off.  They succeeded as we all know this year, and probably will
next year, and so on.  But the 3,000 MW of new power plants under
construction in California, and the 3,000 MW under construction in
Arizona, and the over 16,000 MW of combined power projects in
California, Arizona, and Southern Nevada that are in line for permits
will change the financial landscape in a hurry once energized.  The
prices will soften, returns will be less cherry, and I really want to
know, where will today=01,s accusers be when there is a shake out?
Consumers will reap that benefit, oh you best believe it. But the
alliances to which your opening story alludes simply misses that point.
You gotta make hay while the sun shines.

Now to my proposal.   Michael, I would be willing to work with you to
develop some kind of loan program for residential and small commercial
customers that would, in effect, reduce the economic hardship of higher
electricity prices.  I could imagine, although I haven=01,t tested the idea
with any parties,  that a significant program could be crafted, possibly
secured by the credit of participating generating companies, and
executed by a commercial lending institution such as Bank of America.
Borrowers would pay a fair interest rate and the administrative fees.
It=01,s simply smart business, not charity.  It=01,s one way to amortize th=
e
earnings which came about due to a circumstance of short supply relative
to the sudden growth of demand for power.

Maybe that is a step in the right direction, I don=01,t know. One could
argue that it is no different than SDG&E implementing a level payment
plan for it=01,s consumers.  True, it is no different, because in either
case the customer is paying for the loan interest and administrative
fees, and I consistently believe that a market for credit is more
efficient (am I getting impersonal?) than one instituted by a
monopoly.   Second, the security for these loans is provided by parties
other than the utility=01,s customers.  Further, we wouldn=01,t have to wor=
ry
about PUC oversight and prudence reviews.  We could make this work
quickly.

I will be very interested to hear your thoughts, and the comments of my
members.  Thanks for sending us your letter.

Well, there was only one response, and that was from Carl Imparato.
Here is what Carl said,

=01&Am I missing something? Who is Gow-Jing supposed to represent? (Yes, I
get the pun in the name.  But is he also just an anonymous "everyman" or
is there someone in particular?)

=01&My first response to your question is that Gow-Jing simply replies
=01+Itai!=01, (You could look it up... I think it's Chinese for =01+it hurt=
s!=01,).
Then he takes out a concealed axe, goes on a rampage and kills
everyone.  But that's too realistic, so don't use that ending.  Instead:


=01&Ending:  Just as he was about to reply, a giant 500 foot wall of water
swept through the room, drowning everyone.  And they lived happily ever
after.  The end."

I haven=01,t decided whether to name this response Carl=01,s Gilgamesh Epic
(I.e., Noah and the flood), or Carl=01,s Hydro Dream.  We=01,ll leave the
contest open for another week.  Can=01,t let $5 bucks go the only entry.

>>> Odds and Ends (_!_)

 @@@ What Makes Houston, Houston?

Dan Douglass of Arter and Hadden sent us the following item. Houston,
the unofficial home of the electric power industry, is a town you either
love or hate.  Here are some guiding principles offered by the Chamber
of Commerce of the 4th largest city to enable their many visitors to
cope.

=01=07   First you must learn to pronounce the city  name. It is YEWS-TUN a=
nd
it does not matter how people pronounce it in other places.

=01=07   Forget the traffic rules you learned elsewhere. Houston has its ow=
n
version of traffic rules. Never forget that downtown Houston is composed
entirely of one way streets. The only way to get out of center of town
is to
turn around and start over when you reach Dallas, Texas.

=01=07   All directions start with, "Go down  Westheimer..."

=01=07   Westheimer has no beginning and no end.

=01=07   It's impossible to go around a block and wind up on the street  yo=
u
started on. The Chamber of Commerce calls this a "scenic  drive".

=01=07   The 8am rush hour is from 6:30 to 9:30am. The 5:00 pm rush hour is
from 3:30 to 6:30 pm.  Friday's rush hour starts on Thursday morning.

=01=07   If you actually stop at a yellow light, you cannot be from Houston=
.

=01=07   Kuykendahl Road can only be pronounced by a native, so do not
attempt the phonetic pronunciation. People will simply tilt their heads
to the right and stare at you.

=01=07   Construction on the Gulf Freeway is a way of life, and a permanent
form of entertainment.

=01=07   Many bizarre sights can be explained simply by uttering the phrase=
,
" Oh, we're in Montrose!!"

=01=07   Construction crews aren't doing their job properly  unless they
close down all lanes except one during rush hour.

=01=07   If  someone actually has their turn signal on, it was probably lef=
t
on at the factory where the car was made.

=01=07   White haired men driving red or silver sports cars will not obey a=
ny
known traffic rule and cannot be expected to stop for red lights or stop
signs.

=01=07   All ladies with blue hair who drive Cadillacs or Lincoln
Continentals have the right of way.

=01=07   The above mentioned blue haired ladies also have a  legal right to
turn right from a left lane or to turn left from a right  lane. YOU HAVE
BEEN WARNED!

=01=07   Buying a  Houston street map is a waste of money since there is
absolutely no way that you can route yourself in such a manner as to
avoid major road construction.

=01=07   Houston natives are so rare that they are listed on the endangered
species list. The few remaining specimens are kept in a controlled
environment for their own safety.

=01=07   Sir" and "Ma'am" are used by the person speaking to you if there's=
 a
remote  possibility that you're at least 30 minutes older than they are.

=01=07   "Sugar" is a more common form of  address than "Miss". So is
"Honey". Do not take offense. This is how southerners address grown
women.

=01=07   In Houston we drink Coca-Cola  and Dr. Pepper. It is rumored that
other soft drinks are sold here, but no one will admit to knowing anyone
who actually drinks them.  So don't ask for any other soft drink.

=01=07   What you need to know when arriving at Bush Intercontinental
Airport: Your arrival gate is at least 32 miles away from the Main
Concourse of any terminal.  Walking heels on your boots or walking shoes
are advised.

=01=07   Never honk your horn at another car in Houston traffic. The bumper
sticker that reads, "Keep honking, I'm reloading" is considered fair
warning.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Have a great weekend, y=01,all.

Folks,

Today the FERC issued an Order on SDG&E's complaint to cap generator
bids at $250, and they did so not only with a flat denial, but also by
opening a Section 206 Proceeding to investigate California's wholesale
power markets.  That means there will be full evidentiary hearing at
FERC regarding California's wholesale market.  WPTF is an intervenor in
the case, and I think we should discuss WPTF's strategy and position on
this case before the next Board meeting (September 12).

Toward that end, I have asked Rob Lamkin, our Chairman, to establish a
date for a Board teleconference call to discuss our position, craft a
motion, and vote.  I have also asked Dan Douglass to review the attached
Order of FERC (both docs are the same, but slightly different computer
format), prepare a summary, and to prepare an estimate for WPTF's
participation.  I would be more than happy to be a witness in the case.

I am also sending this notice to our general member representative who
may wish to be participants in our pleading.  Whereas the general
members can not vote on WPTF's major positions, they can participate in
the case development, funding, and preparation.

I will inform you of the date and time for our teleconference Board
meeting in a later e-mail.

The responses from many of you indicate that most of you are going to DC
to meet with Scott Miller's team, and that until that meeting concludes,
you are unable to determine whether a second meeting is required.

I told Scott that we should postpone a second WPTF meeting next week,
either in Houston or Chicago.  It just seemed there would be too few
people who could attend to drag Scott out of DC for a day.  I would
rather hold the opportunity for another time.  For those of you
attending the EPSA meetings in DC this week with FERC, please re-inforce
to Scott Miller that we may want to meet again as his study progresses.
It would be great to get an update of your perspectives on the meeting.
Maybe we should host a teleconference to hear your thoughts.

URGENT REPLY AND ACTION NEEDED

Folks,

Rebecca Smith of the Wall Street Journal called me today and asked how
she could access the bid data the ISO has for the generators in order to
do an investigative in-depth analysis of what has occurred in
California's wholesale power market.  Before I get into the details of
her request, I would urge you in the strongest way possible to consider
her request, and grant it.  We need the light of truth to shine on our
business, and the Wall Street Journal may be one of our best aids.  And
consider this, the data will be available to her  in six months, anyway.

Rebecca's intent is to study the data, and understand the true behavior
of the wholesale market for a given month.  She said July 2000 would
work.  Her hypothesis is unlikely that the hype by Gov Davis and the
State of accusing in-state and out-of-state generators of being gougers
and the guitly parties , and can be deminished by the data.  She thinks
there are plenty of people in the generation market who are playing this
straight as an arrow.  Without the data, she can't say anything
conclusive. (of course, I wonder how she will gather the UDC bid data?)

I have one question.  Did the ISO give the detailed bid data to the EOB
or the PUC?  I thought because neither the EOB nor the ISO would or
could keep the data confidential, the detailed bid data was not
released, only the aggregate data.

I asked her if she would keep the data confidential, in other words, not
pass it on to other parties.  She said she could.  I asked her if other
assocaites of the Wall Street Journal would have access to the data.
She said probably  in order to do an in depth analysis others would have
access on a need to know basis, but that the data would not leave the
Wall Street Journal's control.

Tell me what we should do, and tell me quickly.

Madam Chairwoman,

My name is Gary Ackerman, and I am the Executive Director of the Western
Power Trading Forum.  My forum is a California trade association whose
29 members are buyers, sellers, and exchanges of wholesale and retail
electric power.

We are here today to support the elements of the Community Choice
model.  A workably competitive market is one that has many buyers and
sellers.  Today we have a market with many sellers, but few buyers.  The
Community Choice model provides for many buyers of power, unlike the
present situation where the market is dominated by three; PG&E, SCE, and
SDG&E.  These three buyers represent about 87% of the load in the
restructured electricity market, the balance of which is provided by a
handful of competitive Energy Service Providers.

Community Choice will allow city governments to procure on behalf of
their constituents energy which meets their local energy needs.
Long-term contracts for energy and energy services will be written with
credit-worthy suppliers such as Enron, APS Energy Services, Newwest
Energy, and Green Mountain dot com who will compete to win the business.
"Demand responsiveness" will be created through the innovation that
these sellers will utilize in order to win new business. Cities will be
able to cooperate with bidders to analyze their loads, and sellers will
be motivated to embrace and offer distributed generation, conservation
measures, and enhanced metering technologies.

Imagine a State whose people within a well-defined geographical boundary
are able to select their default provider.  This is the vision of
Community Choice.  It will bring stability and order to our very
successful spot energy exchanges: the California PX Day-Ahead Market,
and APX=01,s  green energy market. These spot markets will continue to grow
and flourish, and continue to provide instantly transparent prices to
eveyone, just as they do today.  However, with only two or three
dominant buyers as we have now, these spot markets may atrophy, and may
perish.  Dominant buyers are able to redirect their volumes from these
exchanges on a whim, causing tremendous swings in volume, additional
price volatility, and a great deal of uncertainty, and instability when
it is least needed.  Alternatively, when there are many buyers, all of
whom are accountable to their local citizenry, and all of who seek a
reasonable balance between spot purchases, and term purchases, the
situation will become more stable, efficient, and less prone to sudden
changes.

We encourage this Committee to take a hard look at Community Choice as a
way to share the benefits of competition, keep the State on its
progressive course, and provide a timely correction to a system that
will earn the trust and confidence of the public.

Thank you
