New CEO to Resurrect Enron

Heavy load energy costs for Wednesday delivery turned in mixed results in
the Western U.S. on Tuesday, reflecting varying weather forecasts in
different regions.  "The average price in the Northwest was slightly lower
today because temperatures were forecast to rise tomorrow, while the average
price in the Southwest rose slightly on expected cooler temperatures," said
one weather watcher.  Off-peak prices, however, were immune to geographical
boundaries, rising at just about all of the Western hubs on the cold
weather.  "There were a lot of people looking to secure off-peak power today
in order to meet demand," said one trader of the stronger light load prices.
Nonetheless, some players were surprised by Tuesday's strength, noting that
the worst of the cold was likely over.  Accordingly, Weather Derivatives was
forecasting a general decline in heating demand throughout the West over the
course of the week, and the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was predicting
mostly normal temperatures for the WSCC from February 4 through 8.  In
Enron-related news, "Turnaround Expert" Stephen Cooper was named interim CEO
of bankrupt Enron Corp. on Tuesday.  Cooper told Enron employees that their
company was in much better shape than some of the hundreds of other
companies he and his partners have represented in bankruptcies and
reorganizations.  "They didn't start with nearly as strong a position as
this company.  They were able to emerge successfully from bankruptcy and I'm
confident that Enron will also," Cooper said in a company-wide voice mail on
Tuesday.  On Monday, about 400 former and current Enron employees filed suit
against several company officials and auditor Arthur Andersen in a federal
court in Houston, alleging that the defendants encouraged employees to buy
Enron stock without being notified about the company's precarious financial
condition.

Peak power prices in the Northwest fell by an average of nearly a buck on
Tuesday, likely due to forecasts indicating the worst of the region's most
recent cold snap had passed.  In addition, strong river flows made for
abundant hydroelectric generation.  Nonetheless, light load prices for
Wednesday delivery traded slightly higher than a day ago, on average.  "It's
still cold at night, and a lot of the hydro is being pushed through during
the peak hours to meet demand, so we're just not seeing as many offers for
the light load hours," said one Northwest utility trader.  Flow forecasts
for Chief Joseph were ratcheted slightly upward on Tuesday, coming in at 110
kcfs through Thursday, 105 kcfs Friday, 80 kcfs Saturday, 65 kcfs Sunday,
110 kcfs Monday, and 105 kcfs next Tuesday.  According to Weather
Derivatives, heating demand in the region was forecast to be 124 percent of
normal on Wednesday, steadily falling to 99 percent of normal by February 3.
Meanwhile, the latest six-to-ten was calling for temperatures to be normal
in Oregon and Washington, and above normal in Idaho and Montana, from
February 4 through 8.

Amid below-normal temperature forecasts, flat spot gas values at the Socal
border, and firmer overnight heating demand, peak power prices were mostly
steady and off-peak prices strengthened in the Golden State on Tuesday.
Heavy load goods at NP15 changed hands predominantly between 23.5 and
24.25$/MWh, but one confirmed trade was heard at 26.5$/MWh.  Light load
pieces saw action from 18.25 to 19.75$/MWh.  Correction:  in the Energy
Market Report for January 28 we incorrectly reported that CPUC
administrative law judge Robert Barnett advised the commission to restore
the direct access provision, which was revoked September 20, 2001, allowing
industrial and household consumers to again chose their ESP through July 1,
2002.  In fact, Barnett's ruling would retroactively cancel direct access
from July 1, 2001 onward, nullifying contracts signed between July 1, 2001
and September 20, 2001.  "This is not a restoration of choice.  This is a
post-birth abortion," emailed one reader.  Additionally, contracts penned
before July 1 but which didn't deliver power until after July 1 are also
cancelled under the new ruling.  "To boil all this down to the simplest
terms, the DWR and the utilities are afraid that too much load switched to
alternate suppliers during that time frame (July through September).  Since
they bought too much power through high-priced contracts they have fewer
kilowatt hours to spread their costs against," summed up one market analyst
on the reason behind the new ruling.  The ruling is on the agenda for the
CPUC's February 7 meeting, at which point it could be enacted.  In unit
news, Calpine's Sutter Plants (546 MW) was almost back to full capacity on
Tuesday, generating at 525 MW.  Helms PGP #1 (407 MW) also returned to the
grid.  Wednesday forecasts called for temperatures to climb slightly, with
highs expected in the upper-40s to low-50s at mid-state load centers and
overnight lows anticipated near freezing.  The latest six-to-ten predicted
normal temperatures from February 4 to 8.


The average price for a 25-megawatt block of spot electricity rose
marginally in the Southwest Tuesday amid continued cold weather.  Heating
demand in the region was expected to remain well above normal through
Friday, but then drop to below-normal levels over the coming weekend.  "It's
cold down here, especially at night, so we're having to buy to cover our
load," said one Phoenix-based trader shivering at the thought of overnight
lows in the 30s.  Peak power at Palo Verde saw action from 23.5 to
25.5$/MWh, with unconfirmed late-day trades heard as high as 26$/MWh.  There
was little in the way of unit news on Tuesday, except for word that
Arizona-based Coronado #1 (395 MW) was still having trouble making it back
online.  Weather forecasts called for gradual warming through the coming
weekend, while the latest six-to-ten was predicting a near-blanketing of
normal temperatures from February 4 through 8.

___________________________________________________________
With little change in market fundamentals to a day ago, peak power prices
posted mixed results across the Eastern Interconnect on Tuesday. Very warm
temperatures continued to smother demand across most of the East, while
cooler conditions were expected in ECAR and Texas, lending some support to
those regions.  According to traders, there were higher prices in the Summer
and Q4 term products on Tuesday.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures rose
on some short covering ahead of February's expiration.  The front month
crawled up 9.8 cents in its last gasp and closed at 2.006$/mmBtu, while
March gained 8.3 cents to end at 2.067$/mmBtu.

Weak demand pummeled the Mid-Atlantic again on Tuesday, sending day-ahead
electricity prices lower.  Western PJM goods for Wednesday delivery changed
hands between 21 and 21.5$/MWh, with the bulk of deals heard around
21.25$/MWh.  February settled about a dime lower to a day ago, at 23.4$/MWh.
LMPs softened on Tuesday, averaging 18.11$/MWh through 15:00 EST, after some
mid-morning, short-lived volatility.  Rumors circulated of an outage at
Keystone #2 (850 MW) on Tuesday, but confirmation was not available, and
little effect was seen on the market regardless, sources said.  Forecasts
for Wednesday called for about five degrees of cooling, with highs expected
in the 57 to 65-degree range and overnight lows in the upper-40s.  The
mercury was expected to settle five degrees lower on Thursday.  The most
current six-to-ten predicted above-normal temperatures from February 4 to 8.

Amid cooler forecasts for Wednesday, peak power prices strengthened in the
Midwest.  Into Cinergy pieces were bought and sold from 17 to 19.3$/MWh,
climbing almost a buck on the high end.  Temperatures were expected to drop
significantly on Wednesday, with highs forecast in the 39 to 49-degree range
across ECAR, with overnight lows about five degrees below there.  The latest
six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from February 4 to 8.

Peak power prices slipped in the Southeast on Tuesday, as warm weather kept
demand very soft.  "It's gas close-out day so everyone's keeping an eye
turned to NYMEX.  A rally there could push spot gas higher tomorrow and thus
the dailies as well," said one SERC player.  Into Entergy deals were done
between 15 and 17.15$/MWh, settling to the low end late.  The February
contract weakened slightly on Tuesday, trading between 18 and 18.1$/MWh.
Texas power firmed up for Wednesday delivery, with much colder temperatures
expected across the Lone Star State.  The most current six-to-ten called for
mostly normal temperatures, with above-normal conditions in the north, from
February 4 to 8.

The Return of Enron?

While some Western hubs saw spot electricity prices for the Friday/Saturday
package that were higher than those seen for Thursday power, the bulk of
transactions took place at lower levels due to reduced weekend demand.
Light load goods on the other hand were the real movers of the day thanks to
below-normal temperatures, with all Western hubs gaining ground, especially
late in the session.  "There were not a lot of off-peak offers out there
today, and we were trying to pick pieces up in order to displace some of our
more expensive gas units," said one utility trader to explain Thursday's
light load rally.  The Andersen accounting firm came under heavy fire as
former partner David Duncan refused to testify in Congress on the shredding
of documents related to the Enron collapse by invoking his Constitutional
right not to incriminate himself.  "Enron robbed the bank, Arthur Andersen
provided the getaway car and they say you were at the wheel," the
subcommittee chairman, Rep. Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., told Duncan.  Meanwhile,
top Andersen executives said that the destruction of documents being sought
by investigators was wrong and largely the fault of Duncan.  UBS-Warburg
took a step towards restarting the acquired North American energy trading
unit of Enron Corp. on Thursday.  UBS management asked all Enron employees
that had accepted offers to attend an impromptu orientation meeting in
Houston.  "Our goal is to reestablish the business," said UBS spokesman
David Walker.  "The buildup will be measured and focused on customer needs."
UBS has no intention of buying any of Enron's current trading positions,
which are in the process of being liquidated following Enron's December 2
bankruptcy filing.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest were as much as 75 cents higher
than levels seen for Thursday, though most deals got done at a discount to
the previous day.  Peak power at the Mid-Columbia ranged from 18.5 to
19.75$/MWh, with the weighted average coming in somewhere around 18.75$/MWh.
Light load electricity at the Mid-C gained an average of 50 cents for the
weekend package, with most players citing cold overnight temperatures as the
catalyst.  Light load energy changed hands from 16.5 to 17.5$/MWh, with
unconfirmed trades heard as high as 18.5$/MWh.  In unit news, Colstrip #3
(700 MW) remained off line for generator repairs, with no available ETR.
According to Weather Derivatives, heating demand in the region was forecast
to be 141 percent of normal through the end of the month, with the strongest
demand expected over the first three days of next week.

Heavy load energy prices softened while light load values appreciated in the
Golden State on Thursday.  "The market seemed unresponsive to factors that
normally affect it today.  Light load was really strong in the south, so
maybe someone got caught short," speculated one California player, while
another trader pointed to upcoming outages in the Southwest.  Peak power
prices at NP15 ranged from 22.25 to 23$/MWh, with shaped pieces heard at
23.5$/MWh.  Light load traded between 17.75 and 20.5$/MWh, running up as the
day progressed.  Similarly, Light load at SP15 traded from 18.75 to
20.5$/MWh, with unconfirmed deals heard as low as 16.5$/MWh early.  In
political news, PG&E will face a critical hearing on Friday in bankruptcy
court.  Judge Montali could decide whether the utility can reform into four
separate companies and if key assets like the Diablo Canyon nukes can be
transferred to one of the proposed companies outside the jurisdiction of the
CPUC.  On the generation front, Alamitos #3 (320 MW) was operating at 240 MW
on Thursday, returning to the grid from an outage that began Monday.
Etiwanda #3 (320 MW) was only operating at 20 megawatts Thursday for planned
maintenance.  Mid-state load centers were expecting high temperatures to
remain in the low-50s on Friday, while highs in the mid-60s were anticipated
in L.A.  Slight cooling was projected for the early part of the new week and
the latest six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from January 30
to February 3.

Light load energy costs in the Southwest gained as much as 2.5$/MWh for the
Friday/Saturday package, though some players were at a loss to explain why.
"It's cold here, but not that cold, so I'm not really sure why off-peak
prices gained so much momentum late in today's session," said one
Phoenix-based trader.  Light load goods at Palo Verde were seen as low as
14.5$/MWh first thing in the morning, then soared all the way up to
18.75$/MWh by the end of trading.  Peak power at Palo Verde ranged from
20.25 to 22.25$/MWh, with the bulk of trades taking place between 21.25 and
21.5$/MWh.  In unit news, Utah-based Bonanza (425 MW) and Arizona-based
Cholla #4 (380 MW) were off line Thursday morning, but both had returned by
the afternoon.  Utah-based Huntington #2 (455 MW), however, was down with a
tube leak.  While no ETR was available, sources were expecting a 48 to
72-hour turnaround.  Navajo #3 (750 MW) was experiencing vibration problems
on a PA fan.  The Arizona-based unit was scheduled to come down for 24 hours
of repairs beginning after Friday's evening peak.

___________________________________________________________
Amid forecasts calling for cooler weather on Friday and higher gas values
early in the day, peak power prices strengthened across the Eastern
Interconnect on Thursday.  "The front-month picked up about a buck
everywhere, although it came off a little later, but that was the real news
today," commented one SERC player.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures were
up early, but fell in late trade.  February eased 2.8 cents to end at
2.048$/mmBtu, while March lost 0.1 cent to close at 2.09$/mmBtu.

Heavy load electricity prices climbed higher in the Mid-Atlantic on
Thursday, on cooler forecasts for Friday.  Western PJM pieces were bought
and sold between 21.85 and 22.75$/MWh.  LMPs spent most of the morning well
above 20$/MWh, but were weaker for most of the afternoon, averaging
21.2$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  Daytime highs for Friday were expected in the
cooler, although still above normal, mid-40s.  However, forecasts through
Monday called for temperatures to continue at least 11 degrees above normal
in the PJM region, and the latest six-to-ten called for above-normal
temperatures from January 30 to February 3.

With the mercury expected to drop throughout the Ohio Valley on Friday and
rumors of a unit shut late Wednesday, heavy load energy costs edged higher
in the Midwest on Thursday.  Into Cinergy day-ahead goods changed hands
between 17.5 and 18.5$/WMh.  "Cinergy opened low, but today it climbed
instead of the slow fade we've seen the last few days.  Prices went above
$18 around 8 am, bounced up and down a bit, but stayed up there," said one
relieved trader.  The February contract was heard trading between 19.7 and
20.25$/MWh, also stronger than a day ago.  According to sources, a Wisconsin
Electric unit shut late Wednesday, but information on which unit, the cause,
or ETR were not available.  Daytime highs for Friday were only expected to
reach the mid-40s, with corresponding overnight lows expected to drop into
the upper-20s.  The cold snap was anticipated to be short-lived, with
weekend and Monday forecasts putting high temperatures right back into the
upper-50s.  The most current six-to-ten predicted mostly above-normal
temperatures, with a normal front moving in from the west, from January 30
to February 3.

With continued bearish fundamentals, peak power prices rose incrementally in
the Southeast and Texas on Thursday.  Into Entergy day-ahead deals were done
from 17 t0 17.7$/MWh, while February traded around 19 to 19.1$/MWh for most
of the day, dropping off a little later to 18.9$/MWh.  Into TVA trades
followed a similar pattern, with peak power for Friday delivery averaging
17$/MWh.  SERC forecasts called for highs to fall into the upper-50s on
Friday, before rebounding into the mid-60s for the weekend and upper-60s for
Monday.  Texas temperatures were expected to linger close to normal through
Saturday, before rising into the mid-70s by Monday.  The up to the minute
six-to-ten predicted above-normal temperatures from January 30 to February
3.

Guys,

The Iron Mtn question you raised early is a little sticky.  Grace may be able to help you, but over 300 boxes were shipped to Iron Mtn today.  Good luck!

Some of you have been inquiring about your continued employment status with Enron.  After speaking with our HR VP in Houston, we can ease your minds somewhat.  At this time, we are unaware of any positions that are targeted to be eliminated on January 31.  Obviously, things can change, however, at this time, you remain an Enron Estate employee.  

If you were targeted for NetCo but did not receive an offer from UBS, you are an Enron Estate employee.  You will continue to be paid as you have in the past until you receive further notice from our department or your supervisor.  

The Estate needs your help to continue functioning.  Many Estate employees are working to assess available projects.  There are other teams who are assessing the skills of each employee.  You can help this process by making contact with other Estate employees to ascertain where you can add value.  If you are unclear about how to do this, please contact us and we will direct you to one of the many project leaders. 

This is a difficult and stressful time for all of us.  We will continue to communicate with you as we learn more from our corporate teams, however, please feel free to contact us if you have any concerns or questions.

Thank you!

SW Left Out in the Cold

Peak power prices in the Western U.S. rose for the typically-discounted
Friday/Saturday package on continued strong weather-related demand and
new-month buying.  While temperatures in the Northwest have already begun to
ease, the Southwest was forecast to remain firmly entrenched in heating
demand country through Sunday.  Slightly stronger spot gas prices may also
have lent support to the dailies.  Balance-of-February contracts were still
trading below the dailies, but most players believed spot electricity prices
would fall to meet the balance next week as warmer weather prevails.  In
other industry news, the General Accounting Office (GAO) said Thursday that
it would sue the White House to try to force Vice President Cheney to
release documents detailing contacts between corporate executives and the
administration's energy task force of which Cheney was the chairman.  David
M. Walker, the comptroller general of the United States and director of the
accounting office, said he intended to ask a federal judge to order Mr.
Cheney to give Congress the identities of energy industry executives who
helped the Bush administration formulate a national energy policy last year,
detailing the subject that each executive discussed with task force members.

The average price paid for day-ahead heavy load energy in the Northwest rose
marginally Thursday on the last remnants of the region's most recent cold
snap, as well as increased demand from the south.  Temperatures had begun to
abate on Thursday, and the region's major load centers were forecast to
return to normal territory by Saturday.  The much-anticipated release of the
February Early Bird Water Supply Forecast from the Northwest River Forecast
Center showed that supplies in the region had risen from the previous report
issued on January 9, but remained mostly below normal on the Columbia and
Snake Rivers.  April through September supply forecasts at The Dalles rose
from 93 to 97 percent, while Grand Coulee gained one percent to 95 percent
for the same period.  "The report may show that water supplies are still
below normal, but there's still plenty of time to beef up these numbers, and
we're already leaps and bounds ahead of where we were at this time last
year," said one Northwest trader.  In unit news, a quasi-official ETR for
Colstrip #3 (700 MW) emerged on Friday, calling for the unit to be back up
between February 5 and 7.  Since we are talking about a Colstrip unit here,
we have opted to err on the side of caution and go with the 7th.

Despite the expectation of gradually easing temperatures over the weekend,
day-ahead power prices firmed up for the Friday/Saturday package in the
Golden State.  "Gas came up a little and new month jitters had everyone on
edge," joked one California trader about the day's action.  SP15 saw the
most strength, with heavy load deals heard between 24 and 27.45$/MWh.
Similarly, NP15 peak goods changed hands from 24 to 27$/MWh, with the bulk
of transactions in the 25 to 26$/MWh range.  Traders said BOM was, not
unexpectedly, still trading at a discount to the dailies.  In political
news, Governor Davis formally requested a FERC investigation into alleged
price manipulation by Enron last summer.  Specifically, the Governor accused
Enron of pushing prices up on long-term contracts.  The CPUC reached an
agreement with the DWR, which would allow the department to issue bonds to
repay the California general fund for power purchases it has made.  To date
the DWR has bought $10 billion worth of electricity, and expects that total
to reach $18 billion by the end of the year.   On the generation front,
Alamitos #4 (320 MW) joined off-line sister units #3 and #6 off-line on
Thursday.  Smaller units Huntington Beach #3 (225 MW) and Southbay #4 (222
MW) also exited the grid for unplanned and planned maintenance,
respectively.  Friday and Saturday forecasts called for highs to linger in
the low-50s mid-state and the low-60s in the south, with overnight lows
expected to be in the chilly 34 to 41 degree range.  Predictions for the new
week called for near-normal conditions, and the latest six-to-ten called for
normal temperatures from February 6 to 10.

As Phoenix residents continued to bask in overnight temperatures in the
mid-30s, peak power prices continued to rise for the Friday/Saturday combo.
Temperatures were forecast to start warming up beginning on Sunday,
prompting traders to expect falling loads and prices next week.  Peak power
at Palo Verde ranged from 23.5 to 26.5$/MWh, with the bulk of deals going
through at the 25$/MWh mark.  Light load goods at the Southwest hub gained
as much as 2.5$/MWh with confirmed transactions anywhere between 16.75 and
19.5$/MWh.  In unit news, Coronado #1 (395 MW) was still having trouble
returning from a January 25 tube leak outage, but sources familiar with the
Arizona-based unit were confident that it would begin to ramp up at 06:00
MST on Friday (though they weren't willing to put money on it).  The latest
six-to-ten from the NWS continued to call for normal temperatures to blanket
the desert region from February 6 through 10.

___________________________________________________________
With the return of ice storms in the Midwest and generally winter-like
conditions to the entire East, peak power prices strengthened on Thursday.
"Prices would have risen even more today, but recent bearish trends have
prompted a wait-and-see attitude among traders," commented one Cinergy
dealer.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures rose on Thursday.  March gained
5.8 cents to close at 2.138$/mmBtu, while April climbed 4.3 cents to end at
2.19$/mmBtu.

Expectations of colder weather in the Mid-Atlantic sent day-ahead
electricity prices higher on Thursday.  Western PJM goods changed hands
between 21.7 and 22$/MWh, while early deals for Monday delivery were heard
at 24.25$/MWh.  Traders said fewer Cinergy imports and more New York exports
were the real movers on Thursday.  Forecasts called for little change on
Friday, but substantial cooling over the weekend and into the new week.  The
most current six-to-ten from the NWS called for above-normal temperatures
for most of PJM and normal conditions along coast from February 6 to 10.

Amid cold weather and winter storms, heavy load energy costs jumped up in
the Midwest on Thursday.  Into Cinergy pieces for Friday were bought and
sold between 17.5 and 19.85$/MWh.  "We only saw two trades below 19$/MWh
today, and most of our volume went through very close to the high end,"
commented one market player, an explanation echoed by most Cinergy traders
on Thursday.  Talk also centered on the new MidwestISO that will take over
transmission responsibilities on Friday.  Pointing to studies by the Edison
Institute and others, most traders thought any changes to the market would
happen gradually, and didn't expect any immediate affects on prices.  "The
new rules will focus on generators for now," said one calm ECAR scheduler.
Next week deals also rose on Thursday, and were heard mostly between 20.15
and 20.35$/MWh.  "The near term was modestly stronger today," summed up one
trader.  In unit news, Rockport (1,300 MW) was reportedly off-line for early
spring maintenance.  Also of note, ECAR load estimates were up from
approximately 31,000 for Friday to 34,000 for Monday.  Colder conditions
finally rolled into ECAR, with forecasts for Friday calling for temperatures
in the low-30s to mid-40s across most of the region.  The mercury was
expected to dip more in the new week, and the latest six-to-ten predicted
mostly above-normal temperatures from February 6 to 10.

Anticipation of a break in the bearish warm weather and rumors of units
coming off for early spring maintenance lent support to SERC and ERCOT spot
prices.  Into Entergy deals were heard between 17.6 and 20.25$/MWh, with
prices Into TVA and ERCOT also breaking into the 20s.  Strength in the
natural gas markets also cheered traders on Thursday.  Texas temperatures
took a dive on Thursday, with the cold front expected to spread into SERC
over the weekend.  The updated six-to-ten called for mostly normal
temperatures across SERC and Texas from February 6 to 10.

An incident just occurred of which you should be aware.

One of our employees received a call from a person (aka: Jennifer Lewis) claiming to be with Enron's HR department working on a task for Robert Jones.  She requested information about employees, their names, and addresses.  "Jennifer" claimed that she had information that needed to be sent to our team per Robert.  She had an old list of employees as she named several employees who are no longer with the company.  She then requested to be faxed a list of our current employees and their addresses.  The fax number given was a Houston number, but with different prefixes than the Enron numbers.

Obviously, this individual was fraudulent and was requesting confidential information.  If any of you receive a call requesting any information about our employees, their addresses, or even asking to confirm if an employee still works at Enron, do not answer their questions.  Please refer these calls to me immediately and I will handle their inquires.  

If you have any questions or need other information, please let me know.  Thank you.

Yesterday, Stephen Cooper,  Enron's newly appointed CEO, communicated to our Houston employees via voicemail yesterday.   Pasted below is the transcript of that message.

STEPHEN F. COOPER VOICEMAIL
January 29, 2002


Good morning everyone, this is Steve Cooper ? it's the morning of January 29th and I wanted to take an opportunity to introduce myself and tell you how pleased I am to have been selected as Enron's interim CEO.  My firm, Zolfo Cooper, my partners and I have assisted hundreds of companies as they have worked their way through the restructuring and reorganization process.  I just wanted to give you some of my thoughts about it as we move forward.

I can't imagine what the past few months have been like for all of you.  I'm sure it's been incredibly difficult, particularly with the glare of the media attention and the numerous investigations and inquiries that have been launched and continue to be launched.  In that environment, I've got to believe it's difficult, if not impossible, for you to focus on what lies ahead for Enron and for the organization.

I'm not going to bother to restate what is in the press release announcing my selection and our new management team this morning, however, I'd like to tell you how we typically approach situations like this.

It's been the experience of myself, my firm, my partners, that in helping companies emerge from bankruptcy, we look at a number of key metrics to gauge the potential for successful restructurings.  Those metrics are typically the organization, the asset base that the company has to bring to bear, customer base, and liquidity.  From what I've been able to tell over the last couple of days and with my exposure to the management team here, Enron has a very, very bright, very capable, very committed, hardworking and dedicated organization.  All of the people I have met are committed to reorganize, restructure and bring Enron to a successful new beginning and emerge from bankruptcy.

Number 2, the physical assets look to me to be of an enormous advantage here.  The regulated assets, the pipelines, the generating plants provide steady and reliable cash flow and provide a very sound fundamental base to restructure around.

Third, loyal customers.  Most of Enron's customers have continued to stand by the company and continue to take delivery of natural gas and electricity on a daily basis.

And fourth, liquidity looks good with the cash the company has on hand, the cash it expects to generate in the near term, and with the backstop of the DIP financing, it doesn't appear that we will have any liquidity issues going forward.

With those four resources nicely in place, I'm very confident that we can successfully restructure this company.  I don't want to leave the impression that it will be easy.  It's going to be an enormous amount of work.  There will be upsets, issues, and concerns along the way.  But I can tell you that I've seen companies in bankruptcy that don't have nearly as strong a position as this company.  They were able to emerge successfully from bankruptcy, and I'm certain Enron will also.

I'm looking forward to working with all of you over the next few months and I'm very pleased to be here.  Jeff, Ray and I will keep you informed on a regular basis as we move forward.  If there are any thoughts, concerns, issues that you would like to bring to my attention, please don't hesitate to drop me a note or give me a call.

Thanks so much, and I look forward to working with all of you.

Enron-omic Stimulus?

Despite the continuing grip of a cold snap, and a rash of unit outages over
the weekend, most Western power prices for Tuesday delivery ended slightly
weaker in the first trading session of the new week.  "Flows are up and
hydro's cheap," explained one marketer of the weather's inability to inject
strength into Western markets.  "If the weather weren't as cold as it is,
the market could even be worse for sellers."  As usual over the past few
months, references to Enron were peppered across the mainstream media on
Monday.  UBS Warburg, the Swiss bank that is in the process of purchasing
the now-defunct EnronOnLine, plans to have the trading business in full
operation by the end of February.  To staff the reborn operation, UBS
Warburg has offered contracts to about 625 of EnronOnLine's 800 former
employees.  The transaction is still pending the approval of various federal
agencies.  In another chapter of the Enron saga, Vice Chairman J. Clifford
Baxter's death was ruled a suicide by Harris County Medical Examiner Joye
Carter on Saturday.  Baxter was considered an important potential witness in
the Enron affair after whistle-blower Sherron Watkins cited his discussion
with then-CEO Jeff Skilling about the company's dubious accounting
practices.  A suicide note was found at the scene, but the details of the
note have not yet been released.  Equally serious are allegations made by
Rep. Henry Waxman of California, indicating that the White House had
apparently changed the contents of a draft energy proposal circulated
through Congress in March of last year to add a provision that specifically
aided Enron Corp. in India.  According to Rep. Waxman, "the provision
appears to have been added to the plan during the period in which the White
House directly controlled the drafting."  The Bush Administration has
understandably tried to distance itself from their biggest political
contributor, denying that its energy plan was crafted to help Enron.  In
related news, GAO head David M. Walker will likely sue Vice President Dick
Cheney for refusing to turn over documents relating to the VP's meetings
with Enron representatives last year.  It would mark the first time the
investigative arm of Congress sued another branch of the government for refu
sal to cooperate with an inquiry.  The Vice President insisted that the GAO
was overstepping its bounds. "Their jurisdiction extends to agencies created
by statute. That's not me," asserted Cheney, "I'm a constitutional officer.
And the authority of the GAO does not extend in that case to my office."
Save it for the judge, Dick.  In gas news, NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas
futures fell hard in Monday trading, with the February contract losing 12.9
cents to settle at 1.908$/mmBtu, and the March contract close behind,
plummeting 12 cents to close at 1.984$/mmBtu.

Heavy load energy prices in the Northwest fell almost 2$/MWh on the low end
for Tuesday delivery.  Healthy hydro flows and a cold front that did not
quite live up to its prediction took the brunt of the blame.  Peak goods at
Mid-Columbia changed hands from 18.8 to 22$/MWh on Monday.  Flows at Chief
Joseph remained as strong as ever this year, coming in at 110 kcfs Tuesday,
105 kcfs Wednesday and Thursday, 100 kcfs Friday, 85 kcfs Saturday, 65 kcfs
Sunday, and 110 kcfs next Monday.  Temperatures were predicted to remain
well below normal through Friday, with lows expected to flirt with freezing.
The latest six-to-ten likewise called for temperatures to remain near to
below normal from February 3 to 7.  There were no new unit outages to report
on Monday.

Despite cold weather and a modest rise in natural gas values at the Socal
border, day-ahead electricity prices softened in the Golden State on Monday.
Heavy load goods lost about 2$/MWh everywhere, while light load prices took
a bigger hit, slipping almost 4$/MWH.  Peak power at SP15 traded between 23
and 25$/MWh, with the bulk of deals done closer to the high end, above
24.25$/MWh. In California politicking, the CPUC voted to reject a compromise
put forth by SDG&E parent Sempra Energy.  The proposal would have used $219
million of the $363 million earned selling power from five-year contracts at
wholesale prices last summer to pay down the balancing account, and thus
benefiting SDG&E rate payers, while allocating the remaining $144 million to
shareholders.  The CPUC said they think the courts will award a higher
number to the balancing account. Californians may soon be allowed to choose
their power provider again, if CPUC administrative law judge Robert Barnett
has his way.  The initiative, a cornerstone of the 1996 deregulation bill,
was revoked September 20, 2001.  However, consumers would have to hurry
their selection, as the option would be back in play for a limited time,
through July 1, 2002.  Barnett said competitive choice was essential to keep
utility customers from unfairly footing the bill for last year's energy
crisis.  On the generation front, Morro Bay #4 (336 MW) and Pittsburg #7
(682 MW) returned to service over the weekend.  Helms PGP #1 (407 MW) joined
sister unit #2 (407 MW) in the out of service category on Monday.  Alamitos
#3 (320 MW) exited the grid on January 26.  Hydro Big Creek (1,020 MW) was
derated, operating at 720 MW.  Sutter Plants (546 MW) was generating at 270
MW.  Tuesday forecasts called for temperatures to linger almost 10 degrees
below normal, with highs in the upper-40s to mid-50s across the state.  The
latest six-to-ten predicted below-normal temperatures from February 3 to 7.

The Southwest was a slight exception to the conditions prevalent across the
WSCC on Monday.  While temperatures were lower than on Friday, peak power
prices remained mostly flat.  Heavy load pieces at Palo Verde traded between
22.75 and 25.75$/MWh, a loss of 75 cents on the low end and no change on the
high.  Temperatures were expected to linger well below normal through
Friday, and the latest six-to-ten predicted likewise from February 3 to 7.
In unit news, coal-fired Navajo #3 (750 MW) returned to the grid Monday
morning, while the ETR for Coronado #1 (395 MW) was revised to early morning
Tuesday, January 29.  Fellow coal unit Huntington #2 (455 MW) also climbed
back onto the grid over the weekend after repairing a tube leak.

As unseasonably warm weather continued and traders harbored little hope of
an upside in the gas market, peak power prices remained mostly steady on
Monday across the Eastern Interconnect.  Traders reported light trading
volume and lots of sunshine outside their windows.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural
gas futures reached new contract lows on Monday, a familiar refrain heard
during the past week.  February lost 12.9 cents in its second to last
trading session, ending the day at 1.908$/mmBtu.  March plunged a similar 12
cents to close at 1.984$/mmBtu.

With a healthy generation landscape and temperatures more usual to late
spring blanketing the region, day-ahead peak electricity prices settled
lower in the Mid-Atlantic on Monday.  Western PJM goods for Tuesday delivery
changed hands between 20.95 and 22.1$/MWh, with most deals done in the 21.05
to 21.5$/MWh range.  Balance of the week trades were heard around 21.7$/MWh,
while balance of the month deals went through near 23.4$/MWh.  Despite an
unusual brief spike to 73$/MWh just after 13:00 EST, LMPs were averaging
21.26$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  Traders reported lackluster trading and no
new outages on Monday.  Tuesday forecasts called for high temperatures to
linger in the balmy 63 to 68 degree range across PJM, before cooling about 5
degrees on Wednesday.  The most current six-to-ten predicted normal
temperatures from February 3 to 7.

Despite record highs near 60 degrees and more of the same expected for
Tuesday, heavy load energy costs were flat to slightly higher in the Midwest
on Monday.  Into Cinergy deals for Tuesday delivery were heard between 17
and 18.5$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions from 17.75 to 18$/MWh.  Most
traders were surprised by the relative strength of the Cinergy hub.  "I
suspect there are quite a few coal units turned off, and most maintenance
schedules have been pushed forward, since the generation clearly isn't
needed," commented one ECAR trader.  In unit news, Quad Cities #1 (821 MW)
remained down for pump support maintenance.  Sources said they expected
sister unit #2 (821 MW) to be taken off-line for the same repairs when #1
returned to the grid, possibly as soon as this week.  The south shore of
Lake Erie, a region where January snow is usually measured in feet, enjoyed
high temperatures in the low-60s on Monday and anticipated the same on
Tuesday.  Indeed, all of ECAR expected similar conditions for Tuesday, while
cooling into the upper-40s was forecast for Wednesday.  The latest
six-to-ten called for normal temperatures from February 3 to 7.

As weak weather-related demand dominated SERC and Texas, peak power prices
weakened on Monday.  Into Entergy deals were done between 15.5 and 18$/MWh,
with the low end reached late in the day.  "I don't see any possibility of a
rally for February.  Gas was hammered again today; the market is very soft
right now," commented one SERC realist.  Tuesday was expected to see high
temperatures solidly in the 70s across SERC and Texas, with slight cooling
predicted as the week progresses.  The most current six-to-ten called for
normal temperatures from February 3 to 7.

Many of you have received an Enron check for MetLife coverage.  Below is the explanation for this payment.
 
_________________________________

The check was from a company called ULR who Enron hired to disburse the monies we received from MetLife resulting from their demutualization - after their IPO stock offering, they became publicly traded instead of being a mutual insurance company.  Because of Enron's past association with MetLife, we received a cash distribution and that's what we gave eligible employees.

Employees who were active as of 9-28-99 and on the payroll 9-28-01 received a share of the distribution.  If you fall within that criteria and you did not receive a check please call ULR at 866-286-1434 to inquire.

Take the Money and Run

Peak power prices for Wednesday delivery were mostly steady across the West
on Tuesday, largely due to a stagnant spot gas market and near-normal
temperatures.  "Prices were trading in very narrow ranges at most of the
hubs today, and that made for a lackluster session," complained one
marketer.  NYMEX Henry Hub contracts for the front months closed lower on
Tuesday despite cold Northeast temperatures, likely due to more moderate
forecasts for next week, and on some technical selling.  March slipped 4.3
cents to close at 2.074$/mmBtu, while April shed 3.2 cents to end at
2.152$/mmBtu.  Most 2003 and 2004 contracts finished up slightly.  The EIA
recently said that it expects U.S. natural gas inventories to end the first
quarter at a record 1.46 tcf.  The low point for U.S. gas stocks at the end
of the winter heating season has averaged about 920 bcf over the past eight
years.  Weekly draws of 144 bcf would be needed over the nine remaining
weeks of withdrawl season to lower inventories to a more normal 1.0 tcf.
Not a likely scenario since draws for the nine-week period have averaged 63
bcf over the past five years.  In other industry news, lawyers for Ken Lay
have refused to accept a subpoena from a congressional committee requiring
his appearance at public hearings.  Mr. Lay's lawyers said they did not know
their client's whereabouts and could not accept any subpoenas on his behalf.
Peggy Peterson, a spokesperson for the House financial services committee
said, "He [Lay's lawyer] tells us he does not know of Lay's whereabouts,
which we find quite puzzling to say the least.  Even if Lay is forced to
appear by a subpoena, many parties believe he would likely plead the Fifth
and not testify.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest were steady to slightly higher than
levels reported a day ago.  Amid continuing cold overnight temperatures,
light load goods traded slightly higher, and in a narrower range.  Flow
forecasts for Chief Joseph were little changed, coming in at 110 kcfs
Wednesday and Thursday, 105 kcfs Friday, 75 kcfs Saturday, 60 kcfs Sunday,
115 kcfs Monday, and 110 kcfs next Tuesday.  No news was good news on the
unit front Tuesday, with no new significant outages reported.  According to
Weather Derivatives, heating demand in the region was forecast to average
115 percent of normal through February 12, with the greatest demand expected
during the latter part of that period.

With little news, close-to-normal temperatures, and steady spot gas prices
at the SoCal border, day-ahead electricity prices edged up slightly in the
Golden State on Tuesday.  Heavy load transactions at NP15 went through from
24.25 up to 26.25$/MWh, with the bulk of deals done in the 24.25 to
24.75$/MWh range and the high end reached late.  Light load goods maintained
their recent strength, trading from 20.25 to 21.5$/MWh.  NP15
balance-of-February saw action around 22.75 to 23.25$/MWh.  "I think some
traders had the March jitters, light and heavy firmed up some there today,"
commented one California player.  SP15 off-peak saw the most strength on
Tuesday, with deals going through as high as 22.95$/MWh for Wednesday
delivery.  There was little change in the generation landscape on Tuesday.
Pittsburg #7 (682 MW) returned to service from a maintenance outage that
began February 2.  Alamitos #3 (320 MW) ramped up to 240 MW, on its way back
from an outage that began January 26.  Forecasts for Wednesday called for
highs at southern load centers to reach the mid-60s, down slightly from
Tuesday's levels, with overnight lows in the upper-40s.  The state capital
anticipated a high of 58 degrees and a low of 36 degrees.  The most current
six-to-ten from the NWS predicted normal temperatures from February 11 to
15.

In the Southwest, peak power prices for Tuesday delivery were flat to
slightly lower to a day ago as weather conditions in cities such as Phoenix
were described as "beautiful, sunny, and in the 70s."  Heavy load energy at
Palo Verde ranged from 22.5 to 23.5$/MWh, with unconfirmed trades heard as
high as 24$/MW.  Mead commanded a premium to PV, but most of that energy was
reportedly bound for the Golden State.  In unit news, Coronado #1 (395 MW)
returned to full power Tuesday, following tube leak repairs that began back
on January 25.  Meanwhile, Coronado #2 (385 MW) slipped into a planned
maintenance outage slated to last until February 10.  Weather Derivatives
forecast heating demand in the desert region to average a mere 85 percent of
normal through February 10, and the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was
calling for mostly normal temperatures from February 11 through 15.

Amid cold temperature forecasts, particularly in SERC, peak power prices
rose across the Eastern Interconnect on Tuesday.  "It was good to see some
strength in the dailies, however short-lived it may be," said one Cinergy
player.  Firmer prices were seen in Balance-of-February and the March/April
contracts as well, despite another lackluster day in gas.  NYMEX Henry Hub
futures edged down again on Tuesday.  March fell 4.3 cents to close at
2.074$/mmBtu, while April lost 3.2 cents to end at 2.152$/mmBtu.

Amid much higher real-time prices, peak electricity prices edged up just
slightly in the Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday.  Western PJM goods for Wednesday
delivery were bought and sold between 24.75 and 25.75$/MWh.  Traders mostly
expected prices to drop off with warmer forecasts for the end of the week.
LMPs reached a lofty high of 115$/MWh early Tuesday morning, but averaged
35.09$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  High temperatures were expected to warm into
the mid-40s on Wednesday and continue there through Saturday.  The latest
six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from February 11 to 15.

With unit outages and winter weather, heavy load energy costs made robust
gains in the Midwest on Tuesday, to the delight of sellers.  "People have
really found their faith today.  Balance-of-Feb was up over a buck and
March/April surged a bit as well," crowed one trader.  Into Cinergy edged up
all day, trading between 22.75 and 26$/MWh, while Balance was heard from
21.1 to 21.35$/MWh and March/April saw action up to 21.25$/MWh.  Power
sellers were concerned with the higher transmission rates they were seeing
from the newly operating MidwestISO on Tuesday.  "I'm seeing a base rate of
4$/MWh, and if you add in ancillary costs of 50 cents and recovery of old
costs at 2.5$/MWh, transmission is costing nearly 7$/MWh, compared to about
4$/MWh before.  That's going to hamper movement in and out of Cinergy, and
increase volatility in the market," predicted one in-the-know seller.  In
unit news, sources said Beaver Valley #2 (833 MW) has been off-line since
February 4.  Traders also said Cook #2 could be back as early as February
16, while the Rockport unit (1,300 MW) was expected to remain down into
mid-March.  High temperatures were predicted to warm slightly into the
upper-30s for Wednesday, and the most current six-to-ten continued to
forecast above-normal temperatures from February 11 to 15.

Bullish weather conditions sent day-ahead electricity prices higher in the
Southeast and Texas on Tuesday.  "I saw some buyers today that have been out
of the market for a while," commented one SERC player.  Into TVA on-peak
pieces traded from 23 to 25$/MWh, with off-peak pieces equally strong from
16 to 19$/MWh.  Unlike northern hubs, Entergy dealers reported a weaker
balance-of-the-month market on Tuesday.  Wednesday forecasts called for well
below-normal temperatures across SERC and Texas, with highs mostly in the
mid-30s to mid-40s.  The mercury was expected to climb into normal territory
by Saturday and the up-to-date six-to-ten predicted above-normal
temperatures from February 11 to 15.

Ken's Not Coming

Peak power prices for Tuesday delivery were slightly lower across the
Western U.S. on Monday, unquestionably the result of less weather-related
demand.  "Temperatures are forecast to be normal to slightly above-normal
through the week in most regions, so we're feeling pretty bearish right
 now," commented one marketer.  A late-session rally for off peak power was
reported at the Mid-Columbia, but most players believed that one or two
parties must have been caught a little bit short given the mild weather and
abundant supplies.  Heating demand in the WSCC was only expected to average
94 percent of normal through February 11, and the latest six-to-ten-day
forecast was calling for mostly normal temperatures from February 10 through
14.  In other industry news, former Enron CEO Ken Lay told Congress on
Sunday that he would refuse to testify before two committees preparing to
hear his testimony.  As a result, the Senate Commerce Committee cancelled
Monday's hearing at which Mr. Lay was to have been the sole witness.  The
Senate Commerce Committee said it would meet Tuesday morning to subpoena Mr.
Lay.  Senator Byron Dorgan, the North Dakota Democrat who heads the
committee's consumer affairs subcommittee, said, "We decided that we really
had no choice but to issue a subpoena to require his attendance."  Mr.
Dorgan said he had been assured by some Republicans on the Commerce
Committee that they would vote in favor of a subpoena.

Tuesday's heavy load energy costs in the Northwest fell slightly from levels
seen for Monday as regional temperatures had begun to moderate.  A late-day
rally occurred in the light load arena when some shorts reportedly entered
the market.  "There wasn't a whole lot of activity for the off peak when the
session began, but later on it just shot up," said one Oregon-based utility
trader.  Heating demand in the region was forecast to pick up over the
coming weekend, rising to an average of 121 percent of normal next Sunday
and Monday.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were revised upward on Monday,
coming in at 110 kcfs through Thursday, 105 kcfs Friday, 75 kcfs Saturday,
60 kcfs Sunday, and 115 kcfs next Monday.  There were a few goings on in the
generation landscape Monday.  Bridger #1 (520 MW) was back in service, but
Bridger #3 and #4 (520 MW each) were brought down so engineers could perform
some "boiler unplugging."  The Wyoming-based units were both expected to
return to service sometime on Thursday.

Amid stagnant gas values and slightly below-normal temperatures, power
prices settled lower in the Golden State on Monday.  "I think prices will
trend down this week, with the warmer weather," commented one California
player.  Heavy load goods at NP15 changed hands between 24 and 24.75$/MWh,
with unconfirmed trades heard as high as 26$/MWh.  Light load pieces were
bought and sold from 19.75 to 21$/MWh.  NP15 Balance-of-February was heard
near 23.25$/MWh.  Of hydroelectric interest, the California DWR listed
snow-water equivalents in the northern section of the state at 111% of
normal.  Spot gas values at the Socal border remained flat to Friday levels,
between 2.13 and 2.18/$mmBtu.  In unit news, gas-fired Alamitos #4 (480 MW)
returned to the grid on Monday, and Pittsburg #7 (682 MW) went down for
planned maintenance on Saturday.  On the weather front, Tuesday forecasts
called for highs to reach 70 degrees in L.A. and 58 to 61 degrees at
mid-state load centers.  Overnight lows were anticipated in the mid-30s to
mid-40s.  The five-day outlook predicted little change through Friday.  The
most current six-to-ten predicted normal temperatures from February 10 to
14.

With Phoenix forecast to see daytime highs in the 70s and overnight lows in
the 50s through the week, day-ahead electricity prices headed lower in the
Southwest on Monday.  Peak power at Palo Verde ranged from 23 to 24.25$/MWh
an average decline of 1$/MWh from levels reported for Monday.  Mead
commanded a premium to PV, with several players stating that the
higher-priced electricity was bound for the California market.  In unit
news, Coronado #1 (395 MW) was operating at 260 megawatts on Monday, but was
still having trouble ramping all the way to full power.  Meanwhile, Coronado
#2 (385 MW) was scheduled to come down early Tuesday for some planned
maintenance slated to last until February 10.  The latest six-to-ten from
the NWS was calling for above-normal temperatures in eastern New Mexico and
normal temperatures everywhere else from February 10 through 14.

As the expected colder temperatures materialized across the Eastern
Interconnect, peak power prices appreciated on Monday.  With the exception
of Texas, which tanked on low gas values, heavy load goods changed hands
firmly in the 20s everywhere.  Maintenance outages also contributed to the
bullish tenor of the day.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures slipped on
Monday, with March falling 2.1 cents to close at 2.117$/mmBtu.  April also
edged down a comparatively mild 1.4 cents to end at 2.184$/mmBtu.

Amid much stronger load forecasts and colder temperatures expected for
Tuesday, heavy load energy costs rose in the Mid-Atlantic on Monday.
Western PJM pieces were bought and sold in a narrow range from 24.9 to
25.3$/MWh.  LMPs bounced up and down three times in the late morning and
early afternoon on Monday, and averaged 22.38$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  On
the generation front, sources gave Keystone #2 (850 MW) a revised expected
off-line date of February 8.  The unit was reportedly slated to undergo 20
days of maintenance.  High temperatures were expected in the upper-30s on
Tuesday, and predicted in the low-40s by the end of the workweek.  The most
current six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from February 10 to
14.

Traders in the Midwest characterized the dailies as a "wild ride" on Monday,
with heavy load electricity prices strengthening considerably on the
aggregate.  "Cinergy opened near 20, climbed to 22.5, came off, and leapt up
all the way to 24$/MWh at the end," said one Cinergy commentator on the day
after the Super Bowl.  While the dailies changed hands from 20 to 24$/MWh on
Monday, market players said the bulk of deals were seen around 21.5$/MWh.
Balance-of-February trades were heard between 20.25 and 20.5$/MWh.  In unit
news, Quad Cities #2 (789 MW) was off the grid for refueling and pump
repairs on Monday, with a tentative ETR of March 11.  Sister unit #1 (821
MW) was in start-up.  Fellow nuke LaSalle (1,144 MW) was also in start-up at
25% late Monday, and expected at full by mid-week.   Temperatures were
slightly colder than anticipated by Friday forecasts, with highs across ECAR
in the mid-30s and lows in the low-20s.  The outlook called for slight
warming, into the low-40s by Thursday, and the latest six-to-ten called for
above-normal temperatures from February 10 to 14.

The Southeast saw some strength on Monday as daily power prices responded to
the colder forecasts.  Into TVA day-ahead peak power prices were heard from
21 to 24$/MWh, with the low end reached late and the bulk of deals done in
the 22 to 22.25$/MWh range, according to traders.  Balance contracts into
TVA were heard trading between 20 and 20.15$/MWh.  Texas electricity prices
weakened on gas, with transactions heard between 18.5 and 19.35$/MWh.  ERCOT
balance-of-the-month saw action mostly from 18 to 18.6$/MWh.  Tuesday
forecasts called for temperatures well below normal across both regions,
with highs expected in the mid-40s.  SERC lows were forecast to drop into
the low-20s.  The most up-to-date six-to-ten predicted above-normal
temperatures from February 10 to 14.

Task Force Taken to Task

Western heavy load energy costs for Monday delivery were mostly steady from
levels reported for the Friday/Saturday package as weather forecasts called
for warmer weather in the new week and spot gas prices remained relatively
stable.  Meanwhile, off-peak prices were largely stronger due to the
inclusion of the all-day Sunday piece.  According to Weather Derivatives,
heating demand in the WSCC was expected drift lower through the new week,
averaging only 96 percent of normal through February 8.  Additionally, the
latest six-to-ten from the NWS was predicting mostly normal temperatures
across the Western U.S. from February 7 through 11.  In other industry news,
a federal judge has ordered Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force
to explain the constitutional arguments behind its refusal to release
details of its meetings last year, which included executives from Enron
Corp. and other large energy firms.  The Bush administration has so far
refused to release details such as the names of people it consulted and the
subjects discussed in drafting George W's energy policy.

Peak power in the Pacific Northwest was little changed for Monday delivery
as forecasted normal temperatures continued to whittle away at heating
demand, though regional demand was expected to remain slightly above normal
through the new week.  While flow forecasts for the Columbia River were
downgraded slightly on Friday, they appeared to be more than ample enough to
satiate regional demand.  Flows at Chief Joseph were forecast to be 75 kcfs
Saturday, 60 kcfs Sunday, 105 kcfs Monday, and 100 kcfs Tuesday through
Friday.  In unit news, Bridger #4 (520 MW) returned to the grid following
repairs to a plugged boiler that began on Wednesday, but Bridger #1 (520 MW)
slipped into the off-line category for tube leak repairs that were expected
to end on Sunday.  The return date for Colstrip #3 (700 MW) was reportedly
pushed back until February 10.  Utah-based Hunter #1 (446 MW) was scheduled
to come down for 24 hours of repairs beginning around midnight on Friday.
On a side note, BPA said Friday that it expects electricity customer McCook
metals to restart partial production at its idled Longview, Washington
aluminum smelter after a new "take-or-pay" contract kicks in on April 1.
Several regional smelters agreed to halt all aluminum production back in
March 2001 due to the electricity supply crunch in the Pacific Northwest.
Several analysts, however, were skeptical as to whether any smelters in the
region would be restarted this year.

With little change in the generation landscape, flat spot gas prices at the
SoCal border, and normal temperature forecasts for the new week, electricity
prices remained steady in the Golden State on Friday.  Light load prices
appreciated again on Friday, boosted by the all-day Sunday inclusion and
recent trends.  Heavy load pieces at NP15 traded between 24 and 27$/MWh, and
light load deals were done from 21.5 to 23.75$/MWh, picking up by more than
buck on both ends.  In political news, PG&E released the asset and debt
breakdown for its proposed spin-off companies.  In their plan, a generating
company would have $5.3 billion in assets and assume $2.4 billion in debt.
An electric transmission company would be valued at $1.6 billion and take on
$1.1 billion in debt.  Lastly, a gas transmission company would have assets
of $1.4 billion and assume $900 million in debt.  However, U.S. bankruptcy
judge Montali has not yet ruled on PG&E's reorganization plan, and for
fracturing of the utility to move forward, the SEC's approval would also be
required.  In unit news, hydro Big Creek Project PSP (1,020 MW) was only
down 150 MW, while gas-burner Alamitos #5 (480 MW) came off the grid for
planned maintenance.  California weather forecasts called for gradual
warming over the weekend, leading temperatures into just below-normal
territory for the early part of the new week.  Highs for Monday and Tuesday
were expected near 70 degrees in Los Angeles, while northern load centers
anticipated highs near 58 degrees.  The most current six-to-ten called for
normal temperatures from February 7 to 11.

Peak power prices in the Southwest were largely steady for Monday delivery,
but some late-day selling caused prices to end near session lows.  Heavy
load energy costs at Palo Verde ranged from 23.75 to 25.5$/MWh, with
unconfirmed deals as low as 22$/MWh reported about an hour after the normal
trading session had ended.  "It's still supposed to be cold to start the new
week, but the worst of it is certainly over, or so our in-house forecasters
say," said one Phoenix-based trader.  Some traders believed unit outages
could keep supplies a bit tight to start the new week, but that forecasted
warming would keep most strength at bay.  Coronado #1 (395 MW) had its
return date pushed back once again.  The Arizona-based unit was now sporting
an ETR of 06:30 MST on Saturday, but parties with a share in the unit said
they had not scheduled with it in place.  Meanwhile, Navajo #2 (750 MW) was
set to enter a planned maintenance outage on February 2, with an official
ETR of February 25.

___________________________________________________________
With the return of winter weather and a rash of unit outages, peak power
prices strengthened across the Eastern Interconnect on Friday.  To the
relief of sellers, forecasts called for a dip in temperatures by Saturday.
"Get out and enjoy it, because tomorrow winter is back," recommended one
Philadelphia-based energy dealer.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures were
steady on Friday.  March was unmoved, closing at 2.138$/mmBtu, while April
rose less than a cent to end at 2.198$/mmBtu.

Heavy load electricity prices climbed back into the mid-20s in the
Mid-Atlantic on Friday, on expectations of stronger loads in the new week
and the possibility of a weekend outage.  Western PJM goods for Monday
delivery changed hands between 24.25 and 24.9$/MWh, gaining a robust 3$/MWh
at both ends of the spectrum.  LMPs appreciated on Friday after spending
most of the business day near 30$/MWh, but only averaged 24.47$/MWh.
According to sources, troubled coal-burner Keystone #2 (850 MW) was expected
off-line over the weekend for maintenance.  The unit was down earlier in the
week for unplanned repairs.  Temperatures in the comfortable 60s were
expected to disappear over the weekend.  Monday forecasts called for normal
conditions across PJM, with highs in the low-40s and lows in the low-30s.
The most current six-to-ten predicted above-normal temperatures from
February 7 to 11.

Expectations of early spring maintenance outages and colder weather
forecasts affected the grid on Friday, bolstering the dailies in ECAR.  Into
Cinergy deals were heard between 18 and 20.5$/MWh, firming up 65 cents to a
day ago.  In unit news, Missouri nuke Callaway (1,125 MW) was off-line on
Friday.  Quad Cities #2 (789 MW) was at 95%, powering down for a maintenance
outage expected to last through the end of February.  Sister unit #1 (821
MW) was still off-line early Friday, but expected to return over the
weekend.  Traders continued to keep their ear to the ground, hoping for
information on other upcoming maintenance outages.  Temperatures for the new
week were expected to drop back into the mid-30s across most of ECAR, with
overnight lows in the frosty low-20s.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS
called for above-normal temperatures from February 7 to 11.

With forecasts finally calling for cold temperatures and a stronger gas
market, peak power prices appreciated in the Southeast on Friday, while
Texas lost ground on little news.  Into Entergy day-ahead pieces were bought
and sold between 19 and 20.5$/MWh, while balance of February traded at a
slight discount around 18.9 to 19.1$/MWh.  ERCOT deals were mostly heard
between 19 and 19.75$/MWh on Friday.  SERC weather was expected to turn cold
with the new week, with overnight lows expected below freezing through
Tuesday.  Texas temperatures were expected to linger in the near-normal
doldrums.  The most current six-to-ten called for above-normal conditions in
Texas and northern SERC and normal temperatures in southern and coastal SERC
from February 7 to 11.

Going Short for the Shortest Month

Day-ahead electricity prices in the Western U.S. were mostly higher
Wednesday on continued cold weather.  Some traders also said that rising
spot gas prices lent support to the daily power market.  "The worst of this
cold snap appears to be over, but the market will likely take a day or so to
react," believed one marketer.  According to Weather Derivatives, heating
demand throughout the West was forecast to fall to below-normal levels over
the coming weekend, and the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was calling for
mostly normal temperatures from February 5 through 9.  February contracts
were trading a buck or two below the dailies at all of the major Western
hubs on Wednesday.  "Historically, February has been a lighter load month
than January, and that's why we're heading into the new month with a short
position," said one matter-of-fact trader.  In other industry news,
Wednesday's AGA inventory report showed that U.S. gas stocks fell 111 bcf
last week, right in line with most industry estimates.  Total U.S.
inventories of 2.294 tcf were still 1.053 tcf, or 85 percent, above last
year.  Of the 111 bcf taken out of storage last week, 19 were drawn in the
Western Consuming region.  Total inventories in the West stood at 360 bcf,
or 71 percent of full.  Western stocks were at 222 bcf the same week a year
ago, and have averaged 265 bcf over the past five years.

Peak power prices in the Northwest rose marginally for Thursday delivery,
despite a general sense that the worst of the cold snap was over.  "We were
a little surprised to see prices rise today because it is supposed to begin
warming up, and we are fairly bearish heading into February," said one
Washington-based trader.  Heating demand in the region was forecast to
steadily drop from 119 percent of normal on Thursday, to 99 percent of
normal on February 6.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were revised upward
again on Wednesday, coming in at 115 kcfs Thursday, 110 kcfs Friday, 80 kcfs
Saturday, 65 kcfs Sunday, 110 kcfs Monday and Tuesday, and 105 kcfs next
Wednesday.  In unit news, Bridger #4 (520 MW) was shut Wednesday morning due
to a plugged boiler.  While no ETR was given for the Wyoming-based unit,
sources familiar with thermal plants said such a problem is usually fixed in
48 hours or less.  While Colstrip #3 (700 MW) remained down with no official
ETR, some parties believed it would not return until February 9.

Amid continued below-normal forecasts for Thursday and stronger natural gas
values at the SoCal border, day-ahead electricity prices for delivery on the
last day of January gained ground in the Golden State.  Traders noted that
spot gas and light load prices were particularly strong.  "I was surprised
that gas was strong today.  The forecasts are warming gradually though, so
gas should start to ease soon and electricity prices should fall off," said
one California trader.  Prices at COB settled higher on Wednesday, with
heavy load deals heard between 21.25 and 22.95$/MWh and light load changing
hands from 18 to 19.5.  "We saw an opportunity to make some money at COB
today," said one Western dealer.  February COB lingered about 2$/MWh cheaper
than the dailies, with peak products heard trading near 20$/MWh and off-peak
pieces reportedly going through from 16.75 to 16.95$/MWh.  Similarly,
front-month deals at NP15 were heard about a dollar cheaper than the
dailies, near 22.75$/MWh for heavy load goods.  CAISO reported little change
in the overall generation landscape on Wednesday, with a difference of less
than 100 MW off-line to a day ago.  Of note, San Luis (326 MW) exited the
grid for planned maintenance.  Thursday temperatures were expected to reach
highs in the low-60s at southern load centers, and about 50 degrees at
mid-state.  The five-day forecast called for gradual warming, with
temperatures still expected to be about four degrees below normal on Sunday.
The most current six-to-ten predicted normal temperatures from February 5 to
9.

While peak power prices in the Southwest dipped by 50 cents on both the high
and low ends, the bulk of deals were done at slightly higher levels than on
the previous day.  Continued cold weather and rising spot gas values were
the main factors lending support to the dailies on Wednesday.  Starting on
Friday, heating demand in the desert region was forecast to drop sharply,
dipping to below-normal levels by February 3.  Peak electricity prices at
Palo Verde ranged from 23$/MWh early, to a late-session high of 26$/MWh,
while February contracts were heard around the 21.65$/MWh mark.  Light load
goods for Thursday delivery traded from 14.75 to 17$/MWh, while February off
peak was seeing action near the 14.7$/MWh level.  There were no new outages
of consequence to report in the Southwest on Wednesday, but looking further
ahead, Palo Verde #2 (1,270 MW) was scheduled to shut for spring maintenance
from March 16 through April 20.  Weather forecasts called for gradual
warming over the coming weekend, and the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was
predicting normal temperatures from February 5 through 9.

Amid expectations of continued warm weather through Friday and a natural gas
storage report within industry estimates, spot electricity prices were
mostly steady across the Eastern Interconnect on Wednesday.  Saturday
predictions called for below-normal temperatures, a break in the bearish
weather pattern that has been depressing demand and prices for much of
January.  The AGA weekly natural gas storage report listed a draw of 111
bcf.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures were mixed, with March picking up
1.3 cents to close at 2.08$/mmBtu, while April slipped 0.3 cent to end the
day at 2.147$/mmBtu.

While revised loads and forecasts met with skepticism from traders in the
Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday, day-ahead electricity prices climbed slightly
higher.  "Loads and temperatures were revised upwards today.  There's
supposed to be some colder weather for the weekend, but bullish forecasts
have been pushed back all month, so we'll see if the cold actually
materializes this time," commented one PJM player with a wait-and-see
attitude.  Western PJM goods for Thursday delivery changed hands between
21.2 and 22.2$/MWh, with the bulk of deals done around 21.6$/MWh.  LMPs
gradually increased from 09:00 through 11:30 EST reaching a high of 44$/MWh,
but averaged only 20.17$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  In unit news, sources said
Keystone #2 (850 MW) returned to the grid on Wednesday, back from a two-day
maintenance outage.  High temperatures were expected in the upper-40s to
low-50s on Thursday, with overnight lows in the 35 to 42-degree range.  The
latest six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from February 5 to 9.

Peak power prices settled lower in the Midwest on Thursday, as continued
bearish fundamentals took their toll on the ECAR market.  Into Cinergy
pieces were bought and sold between 16 and 18.5$/MWh, with the low end
reached in late trade.  No new outages were reported on Thursday, although
traders continued to speculate that many marginal units were off-line for
load following.  Temperatures were predicted to be slightly warmer on
Thursday.  However, the mercury was expected to drop about 15 degrees on
Friday.  The most current six-to-ten predicted above-normal temperatures
from February 5 to 9.

With stronger than expected natural gas values, heavy load energy costs
edged higher in the Southeast on Thursday.  "Prices were bouncing around
quite a bit today.  It was hard to figure out where things were," commented
one Entergy dealer.  Other sources said spring maintenance would start to
affect the market soon, as operators push repairs forward in light of low
prices and warm weather.  Into Entergy trades were heard between 16 and
17.5$/MWh, mostly in the 16s, while February changed hands from 18.35 to
18.5$/MWh.  Texas power remained steady, firming up a buck on the low end.
The bulk of Into TVA deals were done with a 17 handle, but early trades were
heard as low as 16$/MWh.  The updated six-to-ten called for mostly normal
conditions in SERC and Texas from February 5 to 9.

Heavy load energy costs in the Western U.S. rose for Monday delivery on
expectations of more weather-related demand at the start of the new week, as
well as on the usual premium that occurs when scheduling three days out.
Several players expected more strength later in the week when temperatures
were forecast to dip even further.  Some parties also claimed that a rise in
the number of unit outages could play a role in strengthening the daily
electricity market.  "It was a pretty boring day in the spot electricity
market, there was no volatility and no liquidity.  But next week could prove
to be a bit more exciting if the cold weather materializes," said one
marketer on Friday.  Following last Monday's auction for a 51 percent
ownership stake in the company's trading arm, Enron Corp. chose to have
Swiss Bank UBS Warburg take control of its main energy trading business.
Enron declined to say how much UBS is paying, but company lawyers said they
will release details of the winning bid to a New York bankruptcy judge on
Monday.  The move was designed to restore market confidence in the one-time
gas and electricity marketing giant.  Enron shares were suspended since the
NYSE opened on Friday, pending news on the deal.  Andersen, the accounting
firm for Enron, remains in hot water following news that the firm violated
one of the accounting profession's basic auditing standards by destroying
several Enron documents.  There are still many questions surrounding the
destroyed documents, including who shredded them, when, and exactly why.
The issue has without doubt tarnished the reputation of the accounting firm,
all for the sake of Enron.  Misery loves company.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest rose by as much as 2$/MWh for power
to be delivered on Monday, largely the result of forecasted cooling over the
weekend, which was likely to boost demand early in the new week.  "We're
going to drop back down to more seasonable temperatures over the weekend,
and that means we'll have more heating to contend with," said one Northwest
utility trader.  Light load goods rose by an average of 2.5$/MWh on the
anticipated cooling, and partly due to the inclusion of the all-day Sunday
piece.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph remained healthy despite a reduction
in runoff, coming in at 60 kcfs Saturday, 50 kcfs Sunday, 95 kcfs Monday,
and 90 kcfs Tuesday through Friday.  In unit news, Colstrip #4 (700 MW) was
back on the grid Friday, but Colstrip #3 (700 MW) was brought down due to
"generator problems."  While no official ETR was available, sources were
hearing a January 18 return, "at the earliest."  Reports indicated that
Wyoming-based Dave Johnston #3 (230 MW) has been down since January 8, and
the return date, which currently sits at January 15, has been pushed back
several times.  Finally, Bridger #3 (520 MW) was scheduled to shut on
Saturday, January 12 for tube leak repairs.  While no official ETR was
available, conventional wisdom suggests a 48 to 72-hour turnaround.  Weather
forecasts for Seattle and Portland were calling for temperatures to dip to
normal levels over the weekend, while the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was
predicting a near-blanketing of below-normal temperatures across the entire
region from January 17 to 21.

Despite little change in temperature forecasts for Monday and weaker gas
prices at the Socal border, electricity prices for the Sunday/Monday package
settled higher in the Golden State on Friday.  "Sunday's inclusion usually
brings light load prices up, but light load ran up more than I expected at
the end, maybe on the number of units off for the weekend and the colder
weather anticipated in the new week," said one California trader.  On-peak
power at SP15 traded between 21.5 and 23$/MWh, while off-peak deals were
done from 14.5 all the way up to 19.5$/MWh, gaining more than 4$/MWh on the
high end.  In unit news, Etiwanda #4 (320 MW) returned to the grid on
Friday, as did larger gas unit Pittsburg #7 (682 MW), down since January 3
for unplanned maintenance.  Off-and-on Moss Landing #6 (739 MW) came down
for unplanned maintenance, while Encina #5 (332 MW) exited for planned
repairs.  Forecasts at mid-state load centers called for temperatures in the
42 to 57 degree range on Monday, about five degrees above normal for this
time of year.  Los Angeles was anticipating highs around 67 degrees and
overnight lows at 51 degrees on Monday, right at seasonal levels.  The most
current six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from January 17 to
21.

Day-ahead prices in the Southwest made their typical rise for Sunday/Monday
power, but some parties were surprised by the amount of strength seen.
"Prices were up quite a bit, which surprised me since spot gas was off
slightly today and while temperatures are expected to drop, they should
still remain above normal levels," said one Phoenix-based player.  Peak
power at Palo Verde traded from 20.25 to 22.25$/MWh, with the bulk of deals
done at the 21$/MWh mark.  Light load goods ranged from 15 to 18.25$/MWh,
with unconfirmed trades heard as low as 13$/MWh.  In unit news,
Arizona-based Coronado #1 (365 MW) remained off line Friday, but was
expected to ramp up to two thirds load on Saturday, where it will remain for
more repairs until ramping up to full power on January 16.  While most
regional temperatures were expected to remain above or just at normal levels
into the new week, the latest six-to-ten was predicting a round of
below-normal temperatures for the entire desert region from January 17 to
21.

With cooler weather forecast for Monday and a stronger gas market for much
of the day, spot electricity prices traded mostly higher and in tighter
ranges on Friday across the Eastern Interconnect.  However, power prices for
February delivery were mostly down, reflecting a still predominantly bearish
and cautious market.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures had posted gains
on Friday, mainly on weekend risk.  The front-month contract edged up 1.9
cents to close at 2.204$/mmBtu, while March picked up an incremental 0.8
cent to end at 2.203$/mmBtu.

An upturn in the gas market, cooler temperatures for the new week, and
stronger real-time prices for much of the day all helped boost peak power
prices for Monday delivery in the Mid-Atlantic on Friday.  Western PJM goods
were bought and sold between 24.55 and 25.1$/MWh, gaining about 2$/MWh at
both ends.  February deals were heard from 25.4 to 25.5$/MWh.  LMPs spent an
hour or more above 37$/MWh on three occasions during the day on Friday,
bringing the average up to 25.11$/MWh through 15:00 EST, a substantial gain
over Thursday's average.  Traders thought an unexpected outage at one of the
Salem units (1,106 MW) was the most likely culprit sending the dailies and
real-time prices higher.  Sources also thought the unit would remain down
into the early part of the new week.  Forecasts for Monday called for
temperatures to remain above normal but below Friday's readings.  Highs were
expected in the 47 to 50 degree range, but lows were expected to dip into
the low-30s, prompting expectations of more overnight heating load in the
new week.  The most current six-to-ten predicted below-normal conditions
from January 17 to 21.

Heavy load electricity prices traded mostly steady and in a narrower range
to a day ago in the Midwest on Friday.  Into Cinergy pieces changed hands
between 16.5 and 18.15$/MWh.  Although the high end was significantly lower,
the bulk of transactions were seen near Thursday's levels.  The February
contract continued to bleed on Friday, with trades heard between 20.9 and
21.3$/MWh.  "February is hopefully near the low end of where it can trade,
but the physical market is weak, so it all depends on how weather forecasts
and gas do next week," commented one forwards trader.  In unit news,
Michigan-based Cook #2 (1,090 MW) was operating at 90% on Friday, joining
fellow nuke LaSalle (1,144 MW) in coasting down towards mid-month refueling
outages.  Temperatures were expected to remain above normal on Monday, with
highs reaching the low-40s and lows mostly in the upper-20s.  The latest
six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from January 17 to 21.

Bouyed up by gas gains, peak power prices were steady to slightly higher on
Friday in the Southeast.  No new outages were reported on Friday.
Temperatures were expected to cool somewhat in the new week, but ample
generation kept prices in check.  Highs for Monday and Tuesday were expected
in the mid-50s.  The most current six-to-ten called for below-normal
temperatures from January 17 to 21.

Subject:	Production of documents relating to California energy trading

Murray, in line with our discussion last week, could you please forward this email to everyone in Portland whom you think might have documents (contracts, confirmations, notes, etc.) relating to California energy trades?  We are required to produce all such documents, in connection with the ongoing investigations into EPMI's and ENA's energy trading practices.  As Richard told us last week, we already have all the information that was in the possession of persons now at UBS.

We are looking for just hard documents and notes, not electronic stuff (which has already been reviewed).

If any of your addressees have any such document, or are not sure if they do, they should contact me ASAP.

Thanks,

Kenton Erwin

Duncan Demands Immunity

Day-ahead peak power prices in the Western U.S. were mostly steady for
Thursday delivery amid weather forecasts calling for a slight increase in
temperatures and an abundance of Northwest hydropower.  However,
temperatures were expected to drop again beginning on Friday, which offered
sellers a glimmer of hope for a stronger end to the month.  Additionally,
the latest six-to-ten from the National Weather Service showed the Western
U.S. blanketed in below-normal temperatures from January 29 through February
2.  NYMEX Henry Hub gas futures were mixed in moderate trade Wednesday, with
the fronts pushed down to new lows by mostly mild U.S. weather forecasts,
and again later in the session by a bearish AGA weekly inventory report.
February Hub gas fell 3 cents to close at 2.076$/mmBtu after reaching a new
contract low of 2.04$/mmBtu shortly after the AGA report was released.
March also hit a new low of 2.06$/mmBtu, but settled 2.9 cents lower than a
day ago at 2.089$/mmBtu.  The AGA inventory report indicated that 124 bcf
were taken out of storage last week, below industry estimates and the
five-year average drop of 182 bcf.  Total U.S. inventories stood at 2.405
tcf, 1.036 tcf, or 76% above last year.  Of the 124 bcf withdrawn, 21 were
taken out of the Western Consuming Region.  Total Western inventories stood
at 379 bcf, or 75 percent full.  Inventories for the same week a year ago
were 241 bcf, and have averaged 280 bcf over the past five years.  Now for
your daily dose of Enron.  David Duncan, the fired Andersen partner who was
the lead auditor for Enron Corp, challenged Congress by stating via his
attorney that he would invoke his Fifth Amendment rights and refuse to
testify at a hearing scheduled for Thursday unless he was granted immunity.
Committee chairman Rep. Billy Tauzin said that no immunity would be granted
Duncan without consent of the Justice Department.  "I will not provide
immunity to anyone without consent of the Justice Department who is doing a
criminal investigation.  I have not received such a green light to this
date, as to whether or not they change their mind I can't say," said Tauzin
on CNN.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest were unchanged Wednesday as
abundant hydro supplies satiated regional heating demand.  "It's still cold,
but we've got plenty of hydro to cushion us," said one Northwest utility
trader.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were revised higher Wednesday,
coming in at 110 kcfs Thursday, 100 kcfs Friday, 75 kcfs Saturday, 65 kcfs
Sunday, 105 kcfs Monday, and 100 kcfs next Tuesday and Wednesday.  There was
no major unit news to report, but Colstrip #3 (700 MW) remained down for
generator repairs.  According to Weather Derivatives, heating demand in the
region was forecast to average 136% of normal through January 30, with the
greatest demand expected early next week.

Amid a healthy grid and concerns that weather could be slightly warmer than
expected later in the week, electricity prices were mostly steady in the
Golden State on Wednesday.  "We're chasing gas and watching the extended
forecast pretty closely, but otherwise it is a boring day," said one Western
marketer. The heavy load product at SP15 changed hands between 22.55 and
24.4$/MWh, with the bulk of deals done around 23.25$/MWh, while light load
pieces were bought and sold from 16.5 to 18.85$/MWh.  In political news, the
CPUC approved two measures necessary for SCE's return to solvency.  SCE will
be allowed to raise $1.5 billion in bridge financing, which when combined
with $4 billion cash on hand, will permit the bankrupt utility to pay off
its creditors by the end of the first quarter.  Secondly, SCE will raise
consumer rates to cover the bridge financing.  "SCE needs to pay off their
qualifying facilities, but it will be interesting to see whether they are
actually willing and able to pay the CalPX for power purchased on the
exchange, and for power purchased on their behalf by CAISO last winter.  I'm
a little skeptical, but I hope they do," commented one market analyst.  In
unit news, gas-fired Scattergood #3 (445 MW) was off the grid on Wednesday
for planned maintenance.  Highs for Thursday were predicted in the mid-60s
in Los Angeles, and low-50s at mid-state load centers.  Temperatures were
expected to remain below normal in California through Sunday.  The most
current six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from January 29 to
February 2.

On forecasts calling for slight warming, peak power prices in the Southwest
traded slightly lower for Thursday delivery.  "Our overnight lows are
supposed to climb back into the 40s beginning tonight, and that's much more
tolerable than the 30s," said one Phoenix-based trader.  Heavy load energy
at Palo Verde traded anywhere from 19 to 23$/MWh, though most deals went
through around the 22$/MWh mark.  There was no significant unit news to
report on Wednesday, but there was some talk of an upcoming maintenance
outage.  Sources indicated that Navajo #2 (750 MW) was coming down for
planned maintenance on February 2, and returning on February 25.

___________________________________________________________
Hope of an upswing in the spot electricity market was firmly squashed
Wednesday as a bearish AGA report, incredibly warm January temperatures, and
soft gas values plagued the market, sending day-ahead power prices mostly
lower across the Eastern Interconnect.  Temperatures were expected anywhere
from 11 to 20 degrees above normal in the East on Thursday.  The AGA weekly
inventory report listed a total draw of 124 bcf, a number well below
industry estimates of around 145 bcf.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures,
already low, sunk further on the disappointing news coupled with the warm
weather pattern.  February shed 3 cents to close at 2.076$/mmBtu, while the
March contract fell 2.9 cents to end at 2.089$/mmBtu.  Both months reached
new contract lows during the day, before rebounding somewhat prior to the
close.

Heavy load energy costs slipped lower in the Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday.
"The dailies were pretty lame today, with the extremely mild temperatures
and the soft real-time prices.  Prices were a little erratic early, on a
possible unit outage, but demand is too weak for even a large curtailment to
matter," summed up one PJM trader.  Market players remained uncertain as to
which unit shut Wednesday.  Western PJM goods for Thursday delivery traded
between 21.5 and 21.9$/MWh, while the February contract lost about 15 cents,
trading mostly around 23.5$/MWh.  LMPs remained low on Wednesday, after
showing a little strength around 10:00 EST, and averaging 20.68$/MWh through
15:00 EST.  Daytime highs were expected to hit 62 degrees in D.C. on
Thursday, while other PJM load centers also expected warm temperatures, with
highs in the mid-50s.  The most current six-to-ten projected no relief in
sight, as above-normal temperatures were forecast from January 29 to
February 2.

Amid mild weather conditions and little else, peak electricity prices shed
value in the Midwest on Wednesday.  Into Cinergy goods opened at the day's
highest levels, and fell off steadily through the session, trading between
15.5 and 17.9$/MWh.  According to traders, February was actively traded,
bouncing between 19.4 and 19.55$/MWh.  Temperatures were expected to reach
highs in the low-50s on Thursday across ECAR.  The latest six-to-ten called
for above-normal temperatures from January 29 to February 2.

Day-ahead power prices tanked in the Southeast on Wednesday, weighed down by
bearish fundamentals.  Into Entergy deals were done between 17.1 and
18$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions heard near 17.75$/MWh.  February saw
action from 18.3 to 18.4$/MWh.  High temperatures across SERC were expected
in the spring-like upper-60s to low-70s on Thursday.  Texas power prices
bucked the trend on Wednesday, rising on cooler weather for Thursday.  The
most current six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures in the
Southeast from January 29 to February 2.

Andersen Partners Feel the Heat

Day-ahead peak power prices continued to rise in the Western U.S. Tuesday
amid expectations of stronger weather-related demand and higher natural gas
values.  Some parties also believed that an increase in the amount of
off-line generation had something to do with strengthening the daily market.
Not surprisingly, the real talk of the town on Tuesday surrounded the
ongoing Enron saga.  Enron Corp and Swiss bank UBS Warburg detailed their
agreement on Tuesday to split profits from Enron's trading business.  Under
the terms of the deal, UBS would take over the unit and pay Enron 33 percent
of profits for up to 10 years.  The deal give UBS the right to buy one-third
of Enron's royalty interest in the third year of the deal based on the
previous year's profit.  UBS could buy another third in year four, and the
final third in year five.  The deal still requires approval from Judge
Arthur Gonzales of federal bankruptcy court, which may come at a hearing
scheduled for Friday.  While this was good news for some Enron employees, it
was not all roses for the one-time energy-trading giant on Tuesday.  The
NYSE suspended trading of Enron shares and related securities while it
worked to "delist" the stock because of the "expected protracted nature" of
Enron's bankruptcy case and the impact it will have on the company's
stockholders.  In our "if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me" category,
Andersen fired David Duncan, the lead partner for the Enron audit, on
Tuesday for his alleged role in destroying documents related to its review
of Enorn Corp.'s books.  Andersen said thousands of emails and large numbers
of paper documents related to Enron were destroyed shortly after Duncan
learned on October 23 of a an SEC request for information on the audit of
Enron.  Duncan was scheduled to meet with congressional members on
Wednesday.  In addition to the firing of Duncan, Andersen said it put three
other partners involved in Enron's audit on leave, and four Houston-based
partners were relieved of their management responsibilities.  One market
analyst said of the Enron-Andersen fiasco, "People are going to go to jail
over all this, but they'll be in good company."

Peak power prices rose by an average of 75 cents in the Northwest on
Tuesday, largely the result of rising heating demand.  "Our in-house
forecaster is now saying that the cold weather is going to be more severe
and more prolonged than previously expected," claimed one Northwest utility
trader.  Meanwhile, the latest six-to-ten from the NWS continued to call for
below-normal temperatures across the entire region through January 25.  Flow
forecasts for Chief Joseph were revised upward on Tuesday, which surprised
several players since colder weather typically means less runoff and side
flows.  Flows were projected to be 110 kcfs through Thursday, 100 kcfs
Friday, 65 kcfs Saturday, 55 kcfs Sunday, 100 kcfs Monday, and 95 kcfs next
Tuesday.  In unit news, Bridger #3 (520 MW) was reportedly back in service
Tuesday, but the returning megawatts were more than offset by a tube leak
outage that occurred at Colstrip #4 (700 MW).  An official ETR for the
Montana-based Colstrip unit could not be obtained, but was presumed to be
between 48 and 72 hours.

Amid stronger natural gas prices at the Southern California border and
colder weather across the state, day-ahead electricity prices strengthened
across the Golden State on Tuesday.  "Outages are on the rise and the
extended forecasts still look cold," explained one California utility
trader.  Peak power deals at NP15 were done from 25 to 28$/MWh, and
balance-of-January contracts were heard from 25.25 to 26.25$/MWh.  SP15
goods for Wednesday delivery were priced below NP15 deals, but by less than
a buck, and BOM was quoted at 26$/MWh.  On the generation front, nuclear
unit Diablo Canyon #2 (1,087 MW) was operating at 50% capacity on Tuesday
for maintenance on the secondary or non-nuclear side of the plant.  It was
expected to ramp back up to full power sometime over the weekend.  As for
gas units, Encina #5 (332 MW) was generating at 290 MW, on its way back from
a planned maintenance outage that started January 11, and Etiwanda #3 (320
MW) powered up to 150 MW, returning from an outage that began December 22.
Temperature forecasts called for highs to reach 64 degrees on Wednesday at
southern load centers, while highs in the mid-50s and upper-40s were
expected at mid-state.  Temperatures were expected to stay two to six
degrees below normal through Saturday, and the latest six-to-ten called for
continued below-normal conditions from January 21 to 25.

Cooler weather and rising spot gas prices gave the daily electricity market
in the Southwest a lift on Tuesday.  Peak power at Palo Verde traded from
23.95 to 27.5$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions heard between 25.75 and
26$/MWh.  According to Weather Derivatives, heating demand in the desert
region was forecast to average 116 percent of normal through January 22,
while the latest six-to-ten from the NWS calling for a combination of normal
and below-normal temperatures from January 21 through 25.  In unit news, San
Juan #4 (534 MW) was having trouble retuning from tube-leak repairs that
began on January 10.  The New Mexico-based thermal unit had reportedly
ramped up to about 75 percent of capacity, but an ETR to full was not
available as of this writing.

Amid stronger natural gas values, average peak power prices firmed up across
the Eastern Interconnect again on Tuesday. "Crude oil prices were up today
which in turn drove natural gas higher, and the dailies rallied on gas
support, especially in the Southeast," commented one much-encouraged
marketer.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures settled higher.  February
climbed 4.1 cents to end at 2.291$/mmBtu, while March gained 3.3 cents to
close at 2.273$/mmBtu.

On the assumption of healthier generation, heavy load energy costs slipped
by less than a dollar in the Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday.  "I'm hearing the
Keystone unit is back, and the Salem outage should be over as well," said
one usually accurate PJM source.  Western PJM goods for Wednesday delivery
traded between 22.8 and 23.05$/MWh, and the February contract saw action
from 24.5 to 24.7$/MWh, losing about a dime to a day ago.  The NRC
admonished the operators of Pennsylvania-based nuke Limerick #2 (1,115 MW)
for not having sufficient safety measures in place for a worn-out relief
valve.  The NRC gave the problem a "white" rating, their second lowest
classification indicating a low to moderate safety violation, but said they
may conduct further inspections at the plant.  There was no word yet on when
the unit would be off-line for the repair.  Real-time prices were lower on
Tuesday, and averaged 19.85$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  The mercury was
expected to dip on Wednesday, with high temperatures anticipated in the
low-to-mid-40s and low temperatures at or near freezing.  The most current
six-to-ten from the NWS predicted above-normal temperatures from January 21
to 25.

As weather forecasts for Wednesday projected temperatures about five degrees
above normal, day-ahead peak electricity prices edged up in the Midwest on
Tuesday.  Into Cinergy deals were done between 17.75 and 18.75$/MWh, picking
up a quarter on the high end and almost two dollars on the low.  February
saw action from 20.2 to 20.65$/MWh, with the vast majority of deals done at
20.5$/MWh.  In unit news, traders said Cook #2 (1,090 MW) was expected to
exit the grid on Friday for a refueling outage.  The unit has been powering
down since last Wednesday.  High temperatures on Wednesday were forecast to
be in the upper-30s, and corresponding lows were expected in the mid-20s.
The latest six-to-ten called for mostly above-normal conditions, with normal
temperatures in Michigan and Indiana, from January 21 to 25.

With long-awaited strength in the gas market, peak power prices rose in the
Southeast on Tuesday.  Into Entergy deals were heard from 18.95 to
22.35$/MWh.  Traders said the front-month contract rallied, driven mostly by
the dailies, with transactions completed between 19.3 and 19.6$/MWh.  Into
TVA pieces were bought and sold from 20 to 21.5$/MWh.  Temperatures were
expected near normal to slightly above normal through Saturday, with lows
only forecast in the upper-30s to low-40s.  The most current six-to-ten
called for above-normal temperatures from January 21 to 25.

Hello all!

We thought we would clarify the Parking & Mass Transit options:

1) Three options are available:

2WTC/Outside parking lots
- Those who park at 2WTC will continue to be set up with monthly parking deductions
- Those who park in outside lots pay out-of-pocket and submit reimbursement for up to $89.00 per month

Tri-Met
- No out-of-pocket expense or paycheck deduction.

Daily Validations
- Employees may park at any location and submit reimbursement for up to $89.00 per month.

2) You may choose only ONE of these available options.
- If you selected the mass transit option, you must pay out-of-pocket (with no reimbursement) for parking fees incurred on days you choose to drive into the office.

3) If you would like to change your parking/mass transit option, please contact Grace or Julie.

If you have any questions, please let us know.

Thanks!
Your HR Team

Subject:	Parking & Mass Transit Resolution

We have reached resolution regarding the parking and mass transit issue.  Until notified otherwise, the parking and mass transit subsidy will continue as an employee benefit. 

For those who have a payroll parking deduction, your deduction has been stopped.  No deduction should occur on 12/31/01 payroll.  In addition, you should receive a credit for the deduction taken for the 12/15 payroll.  

For those who incurred any out-of-pocket parking costs during the month of December, you may expense up to $89 for reimbursement.  

Beginning 1/1/02, parking and mass transit will continue as follows:

WTC Parking:  You should receive your parking pass in the mail. Payroll deductions will begin on the 1/15/02 paycheck. (No Action Req'd)

Outside Parking Lots:  Park at lot of your choice and pay out of pocket.  Request reimbursement of up to $89 per month. (No payroll parking deduction will occur)

Tri-Met and MAX employees:  Passes are available for January.  If you would like to pick up your pass, please see Debra Davidson.   

NOTE:  Extra Tri-Met passes are available.  If you would like to select mass transit as your parking option, please notify either Grace or myself before Friday, 12/21/01 EOB and we will insure a monthly pass is available.

Validations:  We will no longer validate parking passes, however, you are able to reimburse up to $89 per month for daily parking.

If you have any questions, please let us know!

Hungry for Heat

Heavy load energy costs in the West received a boost on Monday, compliments
of forecasts calling for below-normal temperatures, increased generation
curtailments, and slightly higher natural gas prices.  The long-awaited
colder weather was likely to strengthen spot electricity prices over the
coming days, but opinions varied as to the extent and duration of the
forecasted cooling.  "The cold is finally coming here, and temperatures
should remain below normal for at least a week," said one Northwest trader,
who added, "I'm sure the dailies will react to this bullish weather pattern,
but there's so much gas in storage and water in the rivers that prices may
not rise as much as some people are anticipating."  NYMEX Henry Hub futures
contracts rose Monday amid reported short covering, but the gains were said
to be limited by moderate weather forecasts for the eastern U.S., and
continued concerns surrounding high gas storage levels.  February Hub gas
rose 4.6 cents to close at 2.25$/mmBtu, while March gained 3.7 cents to
settle at 2.24$/mmBtu.  In other industry news, attorneys for bankrupt Enron
Corp. said Monday they were delaying the release of details about Enron's
trading unit sale to the Swiss financial institution UBS Warburg until 23:00
EST Monday.  Enron and its attorneys would not comment on the reason for the
delay.  Patience is a virtue?isn't it?

Peak power prices in the Northwest were on the rise for Tuesday delivery, a
trend many players believed would continue through much of the week.  A
round of colder weather was expected to increase heating demand in the
region over the next several days.  According to Weather Derivatives,
heating demand in the region was expected to average 110 percent of normal
through January 21, while the most recent six-to-ten-day forecast from the
National Weather Service was predicting that below-normal temperatures would
continue blanketing the Northwest through January 24.  Healthy flows at
regional hydro generating units, however, had some parties convinced that
the cold would come and go without incident, and that the upside for daily
prices would therefore be limited.  Flows for Chief Joseph on the Columbia
River came in at 95 kcfs through Thursday, 90 kcfs Friday, 60 kcfs Saturday,
50 kcfs Sunday, and 100 kcfs next Monday.  In unit news, Bridger #3 (520 MW)
was reportedly still off line Monday for tube leak repairs, though sources
were expecting the Wyoming-based unit to return later Monday evening.
Wyoming-based Naughton #3 (330 MW) came down Sunday for tube leak repairs
expected to last from 48 to 72 hours.

With temperatures slated to remain near to slightly above normal through
Friday, day-ahead peak power in the Golden State firmed up for Tuesday
delivery.  Marketers cited an increase in off-line generation as the primary
factor in the price increase.  Peak goods at SP-15 were the premium fare on
Monday, with pieces changing hands between 23 and 26.25$/MWh.  The latest
six-to-ten called for temperatures to hover around normal from January 20 to
24. In the news, the California Chamber of Commerce and the California
Business Roundtable proposed eliminating the Consumer Power and Conservation
Financing Authority and the Electricity Oversight Board, and to consolidate
the duties of the Public Utilities Commission, the Energy Commission, the
Department of Conservation, and the energy division of the California
Department of Water Resources.  Chamber of Commerce President Allan
Zaremberg cited the many overlapping duties of these government entities as
creating competition and conflicts of interest, with the end result of
inflating the state's electricity costs, while two of the entities are of
dubious worth anyhow.  The newly-formed Consumer Power and Conservation
Financing Authority has not done anything besides drain state resources
since its inception in August, and the Electricity Oversight Board has
shrunk to a single board member in the absence of its primary duty - to
oversee the now-defunct California Power Exchange.  Legislators vowed to
untangle the web of conflict, redundancy, and inefficiency carefully, to
avoid causing an even bigger mess than the one they aim to repair.
Generation had a turbulent weekend, with small-unit outages climbing by
almost 1,700 MW since Friday, and Encina #4 (303 MW) joining sister unit
Encina #5 (332 MW) in off-line status.

As temperatures in the Southwest were poised to dip through the week, spot
electricity prices reacted in kind, gaining as much as 4$/MWh for Tuesday
delivery.  Slightly higher natural gas prices were also said to be adding
strength to the dailies.  Peak power at Palo Verde ranged from 22 to
26$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions seen between 23.75 and 24$/MWh.
Weather Derivatives projected that heating demand in the desert region would
average 112 percent of normal through January 21, peaking out at 123 percent
of normal on January 18.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS was also
calling for below-normal temperatures across the Southwest through January
24.  "Our daytime highs are expected to fall into the mid 60s, and our
overnight lows into the mid 40s.  I know that doesn't sound all that cold,
but thin-blooded Southwesterners will undoubtedly be turning on the heat,"
said one Phoenix-based trader.  In unit news, Coronado #1 (365 MW) ramped up
to two thirds capacity over the weekend, and was scheduled to hit full power
sometime on Tuesday.

Day-ahead peak power turned in mixed results on Monday across the Eastern
Interconnect, with northern hubs showing slight price decreases and southern
hubs strengthening in the face of covert unit outages.  In the north,
temperatures as much as 15 degrees above normal sucked the life out of the
market, while southern hubs, despite above-normal temperatures, surged
upward amid what some marketers assumed were unreported unit outages.  NYMEX
gas futures gained some ground Monday on short covering, but mild weather
and massive inventory levels limited the upside. The February Henry Hub
contract gained 4.6 cents to close at 2.25$/mmBtu, while March rose 3.7
cents to settle at 2.24$/mmBtu.

Peak power prices for Tuesday delivery at Western PJM changed hands from 22
to 23.65$/MWh, losing ground from Friday's 24.55 to 25.1$/MWh trades.
Marketers blamed forecasts calling for temperatures as high as 12 degrees
above normal at least through Friday, with rain showers likely Monday and
Tuesday. The latest six-to-ten likewise forecasted temperatures to remain
firmly entrenched in above-normal territory from January 20 through 24. Many
described Monday's market environment as a "state of confusion, with a lack
of clear direction and thin, illiquid trading" among players.  Just before
06:30 on Monday, LMPs spiked to 46$/MWh, and rose again right before 07:00
to just under 40$/MWh, but during peak hours prices did not reach more than
about 32$/MWh.  The average for LMPs on Monday was 22.51$/MWh through 14:00.
In unit news, nuclear unit Salem (1105 MW) was reportedly off-line Monday
for undisclosed reasons, with an ETR of Tuesday, January 15.

Into Cinergy day-ahead prices were mostly flat to Friday's peak power
prices, with goods for Tuesday delivery changing hands from 16 to 18.5$/MWh.
This represented a loss of 50 cents on the low end and a gain of 35 cents on
the high.  Temperatures remained unseasonably warm on Monday, with the
five-day forecast calling for temperatures to swing from up to 8 degrees
above normal on Tuesday to 3 degrees below normal on Thursday.  "There's
still hope that the week could see some strength," dreamed one player in
reference to the favorable forecast.  The latest six-to-ten called for a
return to normalcy from January 20 through 24.  There were no new unit
outages to report in ECAR on Monday, but it was reported that Palisades #1
(789 MW) could join the grid again as soon as January 18.

The blast of cold air that brushed across the Midwest last week was
breathing its last icy breaths in the Southeast on Monday, with temperatures
predicted to pick up and remain above normal through Friday.  Into Entergy
goods traded at a 0.6 to 3.5$/MWh premium from Friday's trades, with peak
power for Tuesday delivery changing hands from 18 to 22.5$/MWh.  Some
marketers insisted that weather had nothing to do with it.  "Obviously,
there are some units off, or prices wouldn't have come up like they did,"
commented one contented seller, "it's just that nobody's going to know which
ones for a couple of days."  The latest six-to-ten predicted Southeastern
temperatures would remain firmly above normal from January 20 to 24.  Peak
power prices for Tuesday delivery at Into TVA also gained ground from prices
seen on Friday, with pieces changing hands from 18.25 to 21.5$/MWh on
Monday.  "Prices started out at the low end, but I think some buyers got
caught, and didn't mind paying a little more to cover themselves, so prices
came up over the session," ventured one savvy trader.  There were no new
unit outages or curtailments to report in the SERC region on Monday, despite
assertions by various players that some units must be out.

Heavy load electricity prices in the Western U.S. continued their recent
rise amid ongoing below-normal temperatures and curtailed generation.  Some
parties also believed that stronger spot gas prices played a role in
strengthening up the Thursday/Friday package.  "The curtailment at Diablo
Canyon caused a chain reaction of higher prices around the West today.  We
have below-normal temperatures everywhere, and California is having to
import lots of power from outside the state," said one marketer.  In fact,
there was some talk that reserves in the Golden State could fall below
acceptable levels Wednesday evening, possibly leading to the first emergency
declaration since July 3, 2001.  NYMEX Henry Hub gas futures ended higher on
Wednesday, but displayed little reaction to the late release of the AGA
weekly storage report.  February gained 10.3 cents to close at 2.394$/mmBtu,
while March ended 9 cents higher at 2.363$/mmBtu.  The AGA inventory report
indicated that 137 bcf were pulled out of storage last week, right in line
with most industry estimates.  Total U.S. inventories stood at 2.529 tcf,
1.070 tcf, or 73 percent, above last year and 529 bcf above the five-year
average.  Of the 137 bcf drawn last week, only seven were taken out of the
Western Consuming Region, but recent cold weather had many players convinced
that next week's report would show a much larger draw in the West.  In other
industry gossip, David Duncan, the lead Andersen partner in charge of the
Enron audit who was fired on Tuesday, met for several hours Wednesday with
lawyers and House of Energy and Commerce Committee staff.  The House Energy
committee was also looking to interview Sherron Watkins, the Enron executive
who wrote the prophetic letter last summer to Ken Lay warning him of big
troubles with the company's accounting policies.  Meanwhile, Enron shares
were trading on the Pink Sheets, an over-the-counter market in which
companies do not have to report financial performance.  On Wednesday, Enron
stock, which now trades under the symbol "enrnq", fell 20 cents to close at
31 cents.  Meanwhile, Enron stock certificates were selling for upwards of
$100 on Ebay due to their collectable value.  Quite a paradox, eh?

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest gained 1.25$/MWh on the high end,
largely due to cold temperatures locally, and reports of increased exports
to California.  Peak power at the Mid-Columbia ranged from 20 to 22.75$/MWh,
with the bulk of trades between 21.25 and 21.5$/MWh.  Flow forecasts for
Chief Joseph remained strong at 100 kcfs Thursday, 95 kcfs Friday, 65 kcfs
Saturday, 55 kcfs Sunday, 100 kcfs Monday, and 95 kcfs next Tuesday and
Wednesday.  In unit news, Colstrip #3 and #4 (700 MW each) remained off
line, both with a revised ETR of January 20.  Wyoming-based Naughton #3 (330
MW) also had its return date backed up until January 18.  Weather forecasts
were calling for below-normal temperatures to continue through the weekend,
while the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was calling for below-normal
temperatures across the entire region from January 22 through 26.

Amid predictions of cold weather on Thursday, rumors of reserves falling
below WSCC required levels, and stronger natural gas values, electricity
prices for the Thursday/Friday package strengthened on Wednesday in the
Golden State.  "Prices opened strong, but slid off some later.  There was
some excitement over the cold weather and stronger loads, and talk that the
CAISO safety margin might not be met across the peak tonight.  It's been a
while since we've seen emergency stages and out of market buying in
California," said one interested party.  Heavy load trades at SP15 were
heard from 28 to 30$/MWh, while light loads goods were being exchanged
between 18 and 19.75$/MWh, with odd-lot products heard at 17 and 20.25$/MWh.
In political news, PG&E ran a full page ad in the major California papers on
Wednesday, accusing the state of filing suit to stop the utility's
reorganization process and staunchly defending their own business practices
as "ethical and fair".  In unit news, Pittsburg #7 (682 MW) was down on
Wednesday, as was El Segundo #3 (337 MW).  Alamitos #4 (320 MW) returned to
the grid.   Temperatures were expected to dip just below freezing in the
capital and other mid-state interior load centers on Thursday.  The Bay Area
and southern regions of the state were only expecting lows in the upper-30s
to mid-40s.  Little change was forecast through Sunday, and the most current
six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from January 22 to 26.

Below-normal temperatures and increased demand from California helped to
boost day-ahead peak power prices in the Southwest by as much as 3$/MWh on
Wednesday.  "They're [California] hurting for power today, and we've even
been asked to turn on some of our gas units to help get them through the
evening peak," said one Southwest utility trader.  Peak power at Palo Verde
saw action from 26 to 30.5$/MWh, with most trades heard in the 28.5 to
29$/MWh range.  Prices generally started on the low end, but quickly
ratcheted up as California players came out of the woodwork looking to
gobble up surplus supplies.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS was calling
for below-normal temperatures to continue from January 22 through 26.

Eastern Markets Pre-Scheduled Firm Power Prices ($/MWh)

Peak (Heavy) in $/MWh
                 Low     Change   High      Change

___________________________________________________________
As stronger natural gas prices, unit curtailments, and winter weather made
their presence felt, day-ahead electricity prices settled slightly higher
across the Eastern Interconnect on Wednesday.  While temperatures remained
cool, there was little change in the weather pattern since Tuesday, which
left traders perplexed about the source of Wednesday's strength,
particularly in the Midwest.  The AGA's weekly storage report listed a
withdrawal of 137 bcf, dead on with industry estimates of 135 to 140 bcf.
The AGA had little influence on late trading, and NYMEX Henry Hub gas
futures rose on Wednesday.  February gained 10.3 cents to close at
2.394$/mmBtu, while March rose 9 cents to end at 2.363$/mmBtu.

As imports dropped and rumors of output constraints on the PJM grid were
heard, peak power prices exhibited some tempered strength in the
Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday.  Western PJM goods for Thursday delivery changed
hands between 23.1 and 23.6$/MWh.  While sources were fairly certain that
the Salem and Keystone outages were finished, rumors circulated that a
different Pennsylvania unit was newly off-line on Wednesday, but no one was
certain exactly which one.  After a promising early spike to 80 and a two
hour mid-morning plateau above 30, LMPs settled lower for the afternoon and
averaged 26.05$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  High temperatures were expected in
the upper-40s on Thursday and lows were forecast in the mid-30s.  Cooling of
about five degrees was expected through Sunday, and the most current
six-to-ten called for normal temperatures in the north of PJM and
above-normal temperatures in the south from January 22 to 26.

Amid official word of a big nuke off the grid and higher natural gas prices,
heavy load energy costs gained significant ground in the Midwest on
Wednesday.  Into Cinergy day-ahead pieces were bought and sold from 19.35 to
22$/MWh, picking up over 3$/MWh on the high end.  The February contract also
traded much higher, with deals heard between 20.9 to 21.45$/MWh, up almost a
dollar to a day ago.  In unit news, Exelon confirmed the outage at their
Illinois Quad Cities #1 (821 MW) on Wednesday.  The unit has been down since
January 9 for repairs to a pump in the reactor vessel.  However, no ETR was
given.  High temperatures were forecast to reach the mid-30s on Thursday,
with overnight lows in the mid-20s.  The latest six-to-ten called for mostly
above-normal temperatures from January 22 to 26.

Peak power prices were steady to slightly higher in the Southeast on
Wednesday.  Into Entergy trades were seen between 19 and 22$/MWh, slipping
towards the low end as the day progressed, while the front month contract
saw action mostly between 20.25 and 20.4$/MWh.  Into TVA deals were done
between 20 and 22.25$/MWh.  High temperatures were anticipated mostly in the
50s across SERC on Thursday, with little change expected through Sunday.
The most current six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from
January 22 to 26.

Mollie,

This morning I talked to one of the Oregon Women's basketball Assistant Coaches and she asked if I would like tickets to the Women's NIT Championship game. The game is Oregon vs. Houston. It will be played tomorrow evening, Wednesday, March 27, at the UofO basketball arena (Mac Court, affectionately know as "The Pit"). 

I told her I would call her back. I can not attend but if someone here in the office would like me to call and see if I can tickets I will call her back. These are team tickets and I suspect they will go fast. If someone is interested I need to know how many tickets they need. 


Jeff

Accounting Regulations

Western peak power prices dropped for Saturday delivery amid waning weekend
loads, while light load prices were mostly higher due to the inclusion of
the all-day Sunday piece.  A Monday/Tuesday package will be scheduled on
Friday so WSCC traders can take off Martin Luther King Day on Monday.  While
MLK Day is not a recognized NERC holiday, it is a national holiday and a
NYMEX Exchange holiday.  NYMEX Henry Hub gas futures fell Thursday despite a
firmer physical market, reportedly due to bearish fundamentals and some
technical selling.  February and March Hub gas both closed at 2.254$/mmBtu,
down 14 cents and 10.9 cents, respectively.  In the political arena, White
House Spokesperson Ari Fleischer finally admitted Enron executives did meet
with President Bush and other Administration officials during the drafting
of their energy policy, but insisted that the company did not receive any
favorable treatment.  The letter to Ken Lay from Enron executive Sherron
Watkins has raised the possibility that the beleaguered company may be
forced to write-off an additional $1.3 billion in reported earnings.  The
cash in question was generated by financial subsidiaries Condor and Raptor,
which were wholly backed by Enron stock. In the wake of Andersen's auditing
debacle, SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt said he intends to form a new committee
responsible for oversight and regulation of the accounting industry.  In the
"too little, too late" category, Enron's Board of Directors voted Thursday
to fire Andersen as the company's auditors.  No word yet on who the lucky
new accountants will be.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest fell by as much as 3.75$/MWh for
Saturday delivery, while trading in a tight range between 18 and 19$/MWh.
Light load goods, however, were flat to slightly higher, with confirmed
transactions between 17 and 18.  Some traders seemed a little surprised by
the very narrow spread between light and heavy load prices, but as one
trader pointed out, "It's cold up here, especially for the off peak hours,
and throw in the all-day Sunday and it's no wonder why the spreads are
merging."  There was also talk Thursday that some parties were concerned
over falling snowpack levels in the Northwest.  According to the NWRFC's
January mid-month water supply forecast, April through September runoff at
The Dalles fell to 91% of normal, down from 93% of normal on the previous
report.  Nonetheless, the report suggested the Pacific Northwest is still
likely to have much healthier water levels in 2002 than last year.  2001 was
one of the region's driest winters ever, and the January mid-month report
for that year showed April through September flows at The Dalles were only
expected to be 68% of normal.  Additionally snow-pillow data for the
Columbia Basin in Canada showed that snowpack levels are holding at
above-normal levels.  Current flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were also
holding their ground, coming in at 100 kcfs Friday, 65 kcfs Saturday, 55
kcfs Sunday, and 100 kcfs next Monday through Thursday.

Peak electricity prices fell while off-peak prices stayed steady in the
Golden State on Thursday, mainly on the usual lighter loads for a weekend
package.  "More heating demand from the colder weekend weather forecast also
kept light load up, and there was some generation back today, cutting into
heavy load prices" said one California trader.  In political news, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court Judge Dennis Montali ruled on Thursday that he would allow
the CPUC to present arguments supporting why they should participate in the
PG&E reorganization process.  The CPUC will have until February 13 to
present their case in support of the plan they favor.  In San Francisco
Superior Court, the California Attorney General requested that Enron be held
in contempt for not turning over documents in the state's case alleging
price gouging by energy companies during last year's energy crisis.  On the
generation front, gas-fired Alamitos #3 (320 MW) returned to service on
Thursday, while sister unit #5 (480 MW) was operating at 290 MW.  Northern
hydro Big Creek Project (1,020 MW) was producing at 68% capacity, derated by
330 MW compared to just 50 MW on Wednesday.  Finally, Morro Bay #3 (337 MW)
powered up to 185 MW on its way back from a planned maintenance outage that
began January 4.  Temperatures were expected to linger below normal through
Monday of the new week.  Highs were predicted to reach the 50s at mid-state
and the low-60s at southern load centers, with corresponding lows
anticipated in the 30s and 40s, respectively.  The latest six-to-ten called
for continued below-normal conditions from January 23 to 27.

Lower weekend loads helped to depress peak power prices in the Southwest on
Thursday.  Heavy load energy costs at Palo Verde fell by as much as
4.5$/MWh, while light load goods rose by an average of 1.25$/MWh.  Off-peak
power at PV traded between 17 and 21$/MWh, with most deals going through
from 17 to 19$/MWh.  There was little to report in the way of unit news in
the desert region on Thursday.  There was some talk of a transformer check
being conducted at Palo Verde #3 (1,270 MW), but output at the nuke was
unaffected.  According to Weather Derivatives, heating demand in the
Southwest was forecast to average 113% of normal through January 24, while
the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was calling for below-normal temperatures
in Arizona and normal temperatures in New Mexico from January 23 through 27.

Despite a slump in natural gas values, cooler forecasts for Friday pushed
peak power prices mostly higher on Thursday across the Eastern Interconnect.
"NYMEX opened lower, promptly taking the wind out of the sails of forwards
trading," said one Midwestern power dealer.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas
futures softened on Thursday, with the February contract down 14 cents to
close at 2.254$/mmBtu.  March lost 10.9 cents to also end at 2.254$/MWh

Peak power prices gained a whopping 20 cents on Thursday in the Mid-Atlantic
due to little change in the weather or generation landscape.  Western PJM
goods for Friday delivery changed hands between 22.65 and 23.8$/MWh.
Traders said February edged up about a dime, with deals done around 24.9 to
24.95$/MWh.  After the usual early morning surge and a few bumps in the late
morning, LMPs averaged 20.34$/MWh through 16:00 EST.  Forecasts for Friday
called for highs in the low-40s and lows near freezing.  Little change was
predicted through Monday, and the latest six-to-ten from the NWS called for
above-normal temperatures from January 23 to 27.

Spot electricity prices edged up on Thursday in the Midwest on a day
characterized by high volatility, fluctuating gas values, and uncertainty
about weather forecasts.  "There were some big players pushing Cinergy
prices around today, and the near-term tanked, so I'm not too excited about
the perceived strength in the dailies," commented one discouraged trader.
Into Cinergy pieces for Friday delivery were bought and sold between 21.3
and 22.85$/MWh, with prices falling lower as the day progressed.  The
February contract opened near 23$/MWh, settled to 22.2$/MWh just before
NYMEX opened, and was trading between 21.25 and 21.4$/MWh by early
afternoon, according to sources.  In unit news, LaSalle (1,144 MW) was in
cold shutdown Thursday, and expected to be off-line through mid-February for
a refueling outage.  Friday temperatures were expected to be lower, with
highs forecast in the low to mid-30s and lows in the mid-20s.  The most
current six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from January 23 to
27.

As natural gas values on Thursday lost most of the gains posted on Wednesday
and other fundamentals remained mostly unchanged, heavy load energy costs
stayed steady in the Southeast.  Into Entergy goods traded between 19.5 and
22.5$/MWh, with the bulk of deals heard from 20.5 to 21.25$/MWh.  Traders
said February deals were going through at around 20$/MWh.  Into TVA
day-ahead pieces saw action from 21 to 22.5$/MWh.  The mercury was expected
to slip about four degrees on Friday in SERC, with high temperatures
settling in the low-50s.  The forecast looked steady there through Monday,
and the latest six-to-ten predicted above-normal temperatures from January
23 to 27.
