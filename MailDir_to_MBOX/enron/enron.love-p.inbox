Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."

He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."

Subject:	RE: NICOR

Right now the parking and loaned deals that we did or do with NIPSCO are not being booked correctly in Unify.  The volumes are coming over onto Supply Verifications or Sales Invoices depending what we are doing.  These deals should be coming over to the service side so that I can be paying for these deals.  However, I do not have anything on the service side.  Therefore, I have a had to pay (paper) manuals to pay NIPSCO and Darla has outstanding A/R & A/P items since we do not invoice or pay NIPSCO for these deals.  I have requested that Marlene forward the service contracts that are currently in the system to verify what we have setup so that you can make sure the deals are setup and we can get these corrected in Unify.  I need to get my payables issues cleared up as well for the manuals I had to do to get them paid as interest was also charged.  If you need to meet up with Darla and I to show you what we have, please let us know.  The sooner we can get these resolved the better.

Thanks,
Marlo

Hi Phillip,

I saw your emails to Marlo James on the Nicor issue that said Scott Palmer would be taking over the Central desk.  I just wanted to see if it would be possible to put this on the highest priority.  Due to the current situation, we need to get this matter resolved ASAP to be able to clear off the balances left sitting on our A/R and A/P.  Let me know if there's any additional information that you would require from me. Again, I stress the urgency of resolving this.  Thanks for your help.  Please update me on any progress as soon as possible.


Thanks
Darla Saucier

All -
 
Starting Wednesday, we all have lots of work to do to get the new company up and running on time.  Going forward,  we need to be a proactive organization as opposed to a reactive organization.  Given that we have the best people in the organization going over, this should not be difficult to accomplish.
 
Let me be very clear.  Playing on the internet will not be tolerated.  There is too much that has to get done over the next two weeks.  That message needs to be communicated to everyone going to the new company.  If people feel like they do not have anything to do,  they should be reading about options or the gas business.  This is a great opportunity for people to make themselves better employees.  I have no problem changing the lists if someone steps up,  or if someone doesn't.  
 
Below,  are a few things I need your help with over the next few days.

(i)    Budget (due Jan 2, 2002)                                                 
        First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) 

Each of you needs to draw up a budget for your region by the end of the day Wednesday.  Use the format that we used for the Enron 2002 Budget process.  Russ and Greg.  You will be one cost center in the new organization.

John,  can you be responsible for coordinating this and compiling all budgets into one by Wednesday night?


(ii)     Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 3)                               To be forwarded to Louise       
        These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.     

I need to detailed plans for what files we are moving,  the systems we need,  and anything that will make the move better for the business.

Kam - Can you coordinate and give me the list be Thursday evening?

(iii)   Seating Plans                                                   Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate 
        We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.

If you have any preferences in this area let me know ASAP, so that I can make requests now.

(iv)    Due Diligence 
        We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

Just so you know, there will be more people in this week.

Please let me know how I can help in getting everything done.  I look forward to a great year working with all of you.  Thanks for all of your hard work.

 

Jeff

Here is a schedule that I received from Phillip.  

I'm not sure if I'm reading the schedule correctly, but here are some items to think about:

1)	The price to Trigen is a 3 month average of NGW and IF for Z3 and Z4 times a premium.
2)	Because only one month at a time rolls off the books, there will always be an OA variance.
3)	The OA variance due to the 3 month rolling average will eventually flatten out over time.
4)	This OA variance, however, doesn't address the fact that Andy is getting 50% Z3 and 50% Z4 and having to deliver Z4.
5)	For November 2001, there was some gas that was delivered at Z3, but the price was not adjusted for fuel and transport, so if
	you deliver gas at Station 65, you do not get the same price as you would for Station 85.

Hopefully this makes sense.

Rachael just got laid off at Deloitte due to cutbacks.  She is outstanding.
Thought Scott might could use some help and that you might could use $2,000.

It's clear the Ebay made the error in this  matter.
They are not being forthcoming about it however. I'am  continuing to communicate with them but they are being less that  honest.
I am not going to pay what I did not bid.
Since Ebay is the culprit here we are caught in the middle  
I'd refrain from leaving any negative at my site, until this  matter can be resolved, since I would have to respond in  kind.

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

For any support issues next week, even if I am not in the office, just leave a message on my phone.
The TDS Hotline, the Sitara Hotline, and my normal number all do page me.  I plan to be in the office next week, but not 8-5 everyday.

We have discovered a problem with physical positions in TDS.  Changed deals potentially can double up the deals volume in TDS.
The TDS group worked late Monday to try and resolve the issue, but failed.  Please let your traders know that the physical positions
cannot be completely relied on.

I have also left a message on you phones to get this message to you.

Thanks
Russ

Sasquatch 2002 is now saved out into:

O, erms, 1intra, financialsdb.

Please save it onto your c drive before using it.

I made one quick adjustment. There is no need to put in your cpr dollars and volumes to get your wacog. The program will calculate your UA4 day-by-day and the P&l's calculate the values. You still need to put in your wacog's in the P&l's. 

Again, please send me all "wishes" about the program and I will try to accomodate all requests. I would like to roll the final product out to everyone in two weeks and plan to have a brown bag on it at that time. In the meantime, please feel free to ask me any questions about the program. Thanks again for your attention.

Pat

I meant the new TTP zone, so no problem. I went ahead and mapped PGLC/TTP just like PGLC/NGPL.

Russ/George - has this new location been mapped to the same curves as the previous location - PGLC/NGPL?  From my standpoint, I think that is the only thing that needs to be done with the exception of changing/adding swaps on these deals.  Please let me know.  Thanks.

We have moved november deals to the new location?? is that going to be a problem??  They were previously on PGLC/NGPL/909285 and they were moved to PGLC/NGPL/TTP.  These deals will need to be moved to the new trade zone of TTP.    Is there anything else we need  to do for Sitara?? and if so who do we need to contact?   THanks!!

 It is important to note that no deals can be moved to this new location until this location is mapped in Sitara,(mid, notional, and gas daily curves)
otherwise any deals booked there will error out in CPR.

Cora, 
	George Grant has set up the new Trade Zone, TTP, for Meter No. TTP, on PGLC.  He has told me there are 44 deals behind Meter No. 

TTP with the Trade Zone of PGLC.  Please let me know when a good time to change the Trade Zone is.

Mr. Grant,

	Cora Pendergrass is  asking for a Trade Zone in PGLC to be created.  She also would like me to change the Trade Zone on meter 

TTP to this new Trade Zone.  She has told me she has already changed the deals behind the meter to match the new Trade Zone.  

I will change the Trade Zone with your final approval.


Trade Zone:	  PGLC TTP		Meter:	TTP		Pipecode:      PGLC


Please let me know as soon as possible.

Effective November 1, 2001 we need to set up a new trade  zone for PGLC.  The new zone should be called PGLC TTP.  The meter number TTP should be mapped to this new trade zone.  It is currently under NGPL.  We have moved deals for November 1, 2001 to this new point on ENA, EMW and ENV.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Also we are trying to get to a point to upload this file for next month so when this is updated can you let me know?  Thanks for your help!!

Well, I hope everyone is having a save and fun holiday season.  The good

available on the family album.  The bad news is that I got a digital
camera and there will be a LOT more pictures available on the family
album. ;)

Anyways, its been update from Christmas, check back after the new year
as there will probably be more from our trip to the desert this weekend.

Hey guys,
 
I just wanted to give you a friendly reminder to please have someone go through all your books to look for any deals with ECC and a third counterparty for October and November 2001 production.  I'll try to find as many as I can, but I'm not as familiar with all of your books as you are, and I don't want any deals to be missed.  If you come across any deals can you please flip them to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as soon as possible as there are only a couple more days left this month, and settlements needs to get started on invoicing.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions on this.
 
Thanks
Stacey

I am attaching the application that you can use to grant access to the books in your regions.
I currently granted access to each of you for access to everything.
This application should be saved to your own drive.  It is also currently under O:/dropbox/TDS


 

Any questions or problems, give me a call.

There is a file under Netco for all currently unused books, rolls and hedge strips.  O:\erms\erms_adm\netco\unused books.  Rather than deleting these, they will remain here until they are needed.  The NGP&L will link to these, once they are needed we will start saving it to the regions file and the links will be updated.  

There is also a hedgestrip saved for each book to the live and unused books files. 

We should also start creating a common file for each region to post the P&L to the website.  Let's try to keep these the same format.  East has a good file that shows new deals and     curveshift.  West used a macro to pull in finished P&L's instead of updating links which eliminated some problems, Randy could help with this.  Figure out what format you want and use that for all regions.   I think everyone agrees that we don't want to give them a positions file like in the past, they should use TDS for that. 

I believe the TRV website should be ready to go tomorrow so we can set up the users and report #'s then.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

Also, all physical weapon-X tabs are linking to an old east book.  I didn't touch that tab yet, we don't know if we're using weapon-X or sasqwatch.

Attached please find the UPDATED responsibilities for the Global Contracts and Global Facilities teams.  Due to restructuring within our group, we have lost three team members (Anthony Campos, Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan, and Ryan Sheeren) to the physical gas confirmation group.  Our team members' individual responsibilities have changed as a result.

Please forward the attached information to your staff and coworkers.  Please call me at x30569 if you should have any questions.

Thanks,
Stacey

Phillip, 

I apologize that it has taken so long to send these to you.  

Accomplishments:

1. Publish the IntraMonth (Physical) and Gas Daily Curves for the East Desk on a daily basis.  

This involves communicating with the traders who mark the curves and checking for reasonableness for the spreads that are set.  I spend extra time before publishing making sure that the curves are correct so that they do not have to be re-published which can slow my co-workers down.  During Bid week, extra curve loading procedures are followed so that we can start publishing curves for the prompt month.  

I also maintain the live feed from the Nymex screen to TDS so that the traders can see Live Curve Shift.  I make sure that all three curve files are updating and publishing correctly and communicate with Pete Keavey to constantly update the Cash/Futures spread (i.e. What the Hub is trading at.)  If TDS is not updating correctly, then it is my responsibility to fix the problem.

2.  Maintain the daily P&L for Gulf 3, Gulf 4, and Gulf 5.

These books contain both physical and financial pieces as well as options.  The main accomplishment in this area has been practicing the technique of hedging using Gas Daily Swaps to keep my trader flat when Gulf 5 was in use.  This was done on a daily basis for 2 months so that my trader, Chuck Ames, did not carry any positions.  It involved swaps and annuities between Gulf 4 and Gulf 5.  By the end of the month, Gulf 5 will be eliminated and the transfer of deals from Gulf 5 to Gulf 4 will be complete.

3.  Update the calc sheet for Enron's long term deal with Florida Power & Light.

I work on computing the desk price for this deal so that the variance between our Economic Estimate and what Unify Should Be is reduced to less than $100.  I check on all the different legs of the deal to make sure that the volumes in Sitara and Tagg are matching and therefore we are coming up with the correct amount for Total Liquidations.  Computing the desk price is an important piece to this deal and usually results in a net change of > $200,000 each month to my Gulf 4 book.  It used to take 2 full days each month of trial and error to compute the desk price until I computed the formula which only requires 2 guesses then will give you the true desk price eliminating any variance each time.  I shared this formula with Alejandra and it is now used in several calc sheets that Ed is currently working on since Alejandra left.

4.  Helped to create a new version of Weapon X.

James Hungerford and I worked together to create a new version of Weapon X that could be used regardless of whether the physical book has fuel expense or not.  This version (Weapon XY) can be used and adapted to fit every physical book within Natural Gas.  It reduced the number of versions that people were using from 9 to 1.  If needed, one person could run and export Weapon X for every physical book on their desk.  This saves time when you are running Weapon X for someone while they are out or on vacation.  I helped to install Weapon XY on the Central Desk and the West Desk and trained others how to use to the new version.


5.  Tie out the OA Flash tab for the Gulf Region on the East Desk at the end of each month.

On the First Day of the month, I make sure that the OA Flash tab for the gulf region (the books Gulf1, Gulf2, Gulf3, Gulf4, TP1, TP2, and Northeast) match what is expected for Transport Commodity and Demand Expense.  I gather the OA Flash tabs for all books and check for any variances.  I also communicate with Jeanne Wukasch in Logistics to make sure that these numbers are absolutely correct before saving out to the Last Day files.  This effort is done in an effort to prevent as much OA as possible.

Please let me know if you have any questions. 

Thank you,
Melissa Videtto

Hey...at least you were able to have a relaxing weekend.  I have seen this happen before in companies (not as good as Enron) and it's a miserable place to be.  Moral sucks for sure.  Sounds like you have a good attitude about it all.  Maybe now is a good time to skim through the Denver Post or Rocky Mountain News to see what the market is like here.  I really do think you can work about anywhere.  Just have to make the decision about Mom...and maybe you can convince her to come here too.
 
Dad said he invited you to the Rockets game Sat.  You should feel pretty special...it's his b-day (56).  No worries on you not being able to go....Auburn vs. Alabama is a huge event! 
 
The pg. is going fine...it seems like I am getting bigger everyday.  It's really nuts.  I'm not too big yet, but I finally look pg. and not just fat..which is totally nice.  Good luck with everything, Rach

Phillip,

Can you provide me with a Sitara deal # for TAGG # QQ6739.2? I am currently working on OA and can not find where this TAGG goes. This is for the Gulf region. Please advise if you do not handle this region.

An old man and his wife have gone to bed.  After laying there a few
minutes the old man farts and says, "Seven Points."

His wife rolls over and says, "What in the world was that?"  The old
man replied, "It's fart football."

A few minutes later the wife lets one go and says, "Touchdown, tie
score."

After about five minutes the old man farts again and says,  "Touchdown,
I'm ahead 14 to 7."

Not to be out done the wife rips another one and says, "Touchdown,  tie

score."

Five seconds go by and she lets out a squeaker and says, "Fieldgoal,  I

lead 17 to 14."

Now the pressures on and the old man refuses to get beat by a woman  so
he strains real hard but to no avail. Realizing a defeat is totally
unacceptable he gives it everything he has but instead of farting he
poops in the bed.

The wife looks and says, "What the hell was that?"

The old man replied, "Half-time, Switch sides."

Scott and Ed,

Per a minibook I ran as of 11/30/01 (w/ the one deal corrected that ENA had misbooked), the value due to Enron should be $214,000 (Dec'01 - Dec'03).  This value is PV'd at LIBOR not 10% as requested by the counterparty.  The value does not include attorney's fees requested by Interconn of $1,500.  In addition, Interconn would need to pay the November '01 invoice due to Enron of approximately $1MM.  The final settlement will need to be approved by the Creditor's Committee before Enron can agree to alleviate Interconn of their contractual obligations regardless if the settlement value is agreed upon by both counterparties.  Let me know if the counterparty has any further discrepancies with the value I calculated above.

Thanks,
emoon

There is a new directory for the curve files.  I am trying to request access to this for the traders so they can't see the rest of our files.

This should be done soon.

Can you move your files to this drive today?

Hey-
 
That's really weird that you never heard back from Steve.  Next time I talk to him I'll ask him what's up.  Maybe he never got it...who knows.
 
Life is good.  We find out next week what we are having...can't wait.  I have held off buying anything until then.  This week I have to go clothes shopping.....I hate shopping (believe it or not).  I am finally starting to show, and not just look fat, so that's good.  Nothing much else is new.
 
I can't even believe my parents are going to Vegas...I am certain my mom won't want to go back.  She will think it's a waste of time/money, but my dad loves it.
 
How is Jackson?  What is up to now?  I am sure he can carry on a full conversation by now.  Every time I see Auburn on TV I think about you and calling...but figure probably not a good idea b/c you are busy watching the game.  Catch 22...
 
Rach

In anticipation of the imminent closing of the UBSW Energy transaction, please have all outstanding employee expenses in your possession filed through Enron's XMS system as soon as possible.   Note to approvers - please approve these expense reports quickly.   Enron will process and pay all pre-closing expenses.   After transaction closing,  payments  for expenses submitted before closing (and put into Enron's XMS system) will be sent to your last known address or direct deposited into your account.

Enron has committed to processing and paying any expenses incurred prior to transaction closing.   If not completed this week, pre-closing expenses should be submitted on a  hard copy expense report form which will be available at  www.enron.com. 
		
There will be a series of e-mails coming out over the next few days highlighting the Travel & Entertainment policies of UBSW Energy and the procedures for processing and payment.   

If you have any questions, please contact Hope Vargas (3-5280) or Georganne Hodges (3-0430).

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

whats up man?

How are things with you?  Hearing all the news about Enron and all, figured
I see how you are fairing.  I really hope that your not effected by all the
bs.  We are doing well here.  Getting cold, but hey, its Norway right?  We
have starting building a house and its going well.  I figure it will take
about a year to get it all done. I would like to do as much of the work
myself, but I will see how long that goes.  Anyway, The Family and myself
will be in Houston in late Feb.  We are having a small reception in Clear
Lake and would love to see yall there if you can make it.

Let me here from you soon, hope all is well with you and the family.

Tell your moms whats up from me.

Tommy

>From the State where drunk driving is considered a  sport, comes a true story
from Oklahoma. Recently a routine police patrol  parked outside a local
neighborhood tavern.
Late in the evening the  officer noticed a man leaving the bar so intoxicated
that he could barely  walk. The man stumbled around the parking lot for a few
minutes, with the  officer quietly observing.
After what seemed an eternity and trying his  keys on five vehicles, the man
managed to find his car which he fell into. He  was there for a few minutes
as a number of other patrons left the bar and  drove off.
Finally he started the car, switched the wipers on and off (it  was a fine
dry night) flicked the blinkers on, then off, honked the horn and  then
switched on the lights. He moved the vehicle forward
a few inches,  reversed a little and then remained still for a few more
minutes as some more  vehicles left. At last he pulled out of
the parking lot and started to drive  slowly down the road.
The police officer, having patiently waited all  this time, now started up
the patrol car, put on the flashing lights,  promptly pulled the man over and
carried out a Breathalyzer test. To his  amazement the Breathalyzer indicated
no evidence of the man having consumed  alcohol at all!
Dumbfounded, the officer said "I'll have to ask you to  accompany me to the
Police station this Breathalyzer equipment must be  broken."
"I doubt it," said the man, "Tonight I'm the designated  decoy."

Please pass this onto the individuals in your groups:

Tomorrow's simulation and Friday's desk to desk trading will provide an excellent opportunity for us to double check the online deals in tagg and sitara.  Please pay special attention to these deals and let me know of any bridging issues.  Even though we have been testing and having various people check the deals in the underlying systems, I am afraid of any logic that may be hardcoded in the bridge. 

Notify me immediately of any deals that are bridging incorrectly and I will try to resolve as soon as possible.  I will also be watching the bridge to research any failed deals.

Thanks for your help.  Let's hope for a smooth transition!

Make sure on the TDS Curve Manager not to hit the    button on the publish sheet.  This button normally
brings in the latest version of code, however the latest version does not include information for the 'Y' curve.
This will be fixed after the code freeze that is now in place is released.

Any questions or problems, give me a call.

Attached please find a counterparty list with erms code that could be useful to each of you when entering deals in Sitara and in Tagg.  These counterparties names are used across all desks.

Phillip,

I apologize that it has taken me so long to send you an e-mail like you asked us to, but I just wanted to send some suggestions/thoughts about things on the East Desk.

1.  I really like the idea of weekly meetings.  Especially in the new building where we will be spaced out and not all sitting together, I think it would be good for team unity.  Even if the meeting is only 10 minutes long, it gives the group a chance to talk about what everyone is working on and projects that we can work with others on.  Also, with people joining East and leaving East, the meetings could give us a chance to get to know each other better.  I realize that meetings are not necessary every week, but 2 or 3 a month have very helpful and beneficial for me.

2.  We were all going to give a small "lesson" on an area of our jobs that we have a strong knowledge about and present it to the others in our group.  Jeff has already given a lesson on NX3 Basis positions.  Although the lessons may be a little nerve wracking, I think they would be very useful to continue.  For example, the subjects of Liquidation, Storage, and OA are all areas I would like to know more about.

That's it really.  Thank you for all of your help so far with the Gulf4/5 "merger".  I am really excited about our new group and I can't wait to move to the new building.

Thanks,
Melissa

In case the happening comes sooner rather than later, here is my contact info. I want you all to know it's been great working here and learning everything I have for the past 5 years, and I wouldn't trade this experience for anything, and I hope you wouldn't either (other than the Great Slide, that is). I hope everyone tries to stay in touch. If you haven't heard already, try this link out for an alumni directory to stay in touch. If you haven't already done so, please let me know your contact info as well.

A few more important reminders...

Chairs:  Must be labeled for the move---use the wire tags included in your move packets.
Keyboards, mice:  ONLY label non-standard types (i.e. wireless mice/keyboards, special ergonomic keyboards); otherwise, do not label.
Phones:  Do not label these.  New phones will be at your workstations at Enron Center South.
Laptops, cell phones, palm pilots, etc.:  Be sure to remind your groups to take these home.  The move team will not be responsible for moving these over.  However, docking station, cradles, etc. should be labeled.  The move team will move these over and set them up for you.

Thanks again for all your hard work,
Christa

Subject:	Move Related Issues

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  Hopefully,  you and your groups are all progressing well in your preparations for the move this Friday. Please take the time to read the information contained in this message because most of the information contains reminders or FYI items and will be important to you and your group.  Please forward this to those in your group that may need this information.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 6 boxes per person.  You may call Facilities (3-6300) if you need to request additional boxes.

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

Brian invited his mother over for dinner. During the course of the meal, Brian's mother couldn't help but keep noticing how beautiful Brian's roommate, Stephanie, was. Mrs. Hester had long been suspicious of a relationship between Brian and his roomate Stephanie, and this had only made her more curious. Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, Mrs. Hester started to wonder if there was more between Brian and his roommate, Stephanie, than met the eye.
Reading his mom's thoughts, Brian volunteered, "I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you Stephanie and I are just roommates."

About a week later, Stephanie came to Brian saying, "Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the beautiful
silver gravy ladle. You don't suppose she took it, do you?" Brian answered, "Well, I doubt it, but I'll send her an e-mail just to be sure." So he sat down and wrote: 
"Dear Mother, I'm not saying that you 'did' take the gravy ladle from the house, I'm not saying that you 'did not' take the gravy ladle. But the fact remains that one has been missing ever since you were here for dinner."
Several days later, Brian received a letter from his mother that read: 
Dear son, I'm not saying that you 'do' sleep with Stephanie, and I'm not saying that you 'do not' sleep with Stephanie. But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her own bed, she would have found the gravy ladle by now." Love, Mom

LESSON OF THE DAY.........NEVER LIE TO YOUR MOTHER 
[Peterson, Phil] ....and mothers are sneaky.

Sorry bro I guess I don't have you in my address book, I included people
that were in my hotmail address book.  I actually have been twice since we
went.  Once for a bachelor party that was crazy and then a couple of weeks
ago when I only got 4 hours of sleep the whole weekend.  The last time was
pretty cool because we played Texas Hold'em the whole time out there.  I
had never played poker in Vegas before but it was pretty fun.

Anyway I just thought I would see if any of you guys need a hook up.

Take care man.

what is up with leaving me off the email this morning?  You don't want
me to come work for you too?  My feelings were hurt.  Hope things are
going well in San Antonio.  We need to get back to Vegas so I can gamble
away what is left of my retirement.

There is an excel queries file out there too.  I moved the files I use so if there is anything else you need please move it.  Greg will be helping us with the million different forwards details we have to get one for financial and one for physical that have everything we need.  The copy post-id macro is also in there.

I think we should also put the position report file in there that Jad/Couch created as a backup to the CEPos/East Positions.  Couch can you put the query file you set up for the price desk?

I have been working with the IT group with the development of a new physical system and reports.  I have given them my wish list for reporting but would like you all to see what I've proposed and get any additional requests you may have.  Are you all available to attend a 10:00 meeting today to discuss this with them?

I thought I sent this but it has been in draft mode...sorry.

I have started the Business Requirements document and stumbled across more questions from meetings with the project team.

I am going to need to know the purpose of each report (why are they used).
For each report how are the fields/columns utilized.

I know the second question could take some time.  The types of questions I would need to document are what type of information is being given to generate the reports; what fields/columns are mandatory?; are their any calculations that are used to generate columns or are all of them pulled in from other systems.

I believe Priscilla is asking if VNG is to pay Transport for 6-10/01 on these deals. The demand charges for these months were reversed 1/15/02. I was not part of this. Can you answer her questions. Thanks.

Please have someone check on the following deal number and the reversal of charges.

#602019 -	June 01, July 01, Aug 01, Sept 01, Oct 01

#602021 -	June 01, July 01, Aug 01, Sept 01, Oct 01

#602027 -	June 01, July 01, Aug 01, Sept 01, Oct 01

#1020386	Oct 01

#602028	Oct 01

I believe what has happened is that we reversed all these charges for Nov 01 so that VNG would pay all their own transport and these months got reversed as well.

Please have someone notify me when I can see the corrections in Unify.

Thank you for your assistance.

In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be "Double Deducted" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence. 

    

Thanks, Tony Jarrett

Subject:	Updating Curve Files for Netco Environment

The curve files for Netco will need to be modified before they are used in the new environment.


    1)   On the Publish tab in the Curve File sheet.
Change the environment name on the 5th row to ermtp
Change the service name on the 5th row to 7525
Change the Network Address on the 5th row to ;239.44.16.1;     

2) Then hit the  << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >>  button on the publish sheet and save the new file.
If the sheet does not have the button, just save the file, close it, and bring it back up.

3)	Save your curves as normal

4)	Any questions or problems, please give me a call

ves and calm fears in the stock, bond and energy markets.
An Enron spokesman confirmed that the company is negotiating a new credit l=
ine, but said he couldn't supply any further details.=20
Houston-based Enron is the nation's biggest energy trader and a principal i=
n nearly one-quarter of all electricity and natural-gas trades. Once a favo=
rite of Wall Street, the company now is in the unfamiliar position of convi=
ncing a deeply concerned investment community that, despite difficulties, i=
ts finances remain sound.=20
Confidence in Enron's financial situation was shaken after Enron earlier th=
is month announced a $618 million third-quarter loss and disclosed a $1.2 b=
illion erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions =
it had done with entities connected to its then-chief financial officer, An=
drew Fastow.=20
Last week, Enron replaced Mr. Fastow and said that the Securities and Excha=
nge Commission was looking into the transactions. The company has consisten=
tly said that the transactions were proper and legal.=20
Enron's stock price fell again Friday. As of 4 p.m., in composite trading o=
n the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were down 95 cents at $15.40. E=
nron shares have fallen 50% in the past two weeks and are down 83% from a S=
ept. 18, 2000, high of $89.63.=20
Late last week, Enron tapped its existing credit lines, with part of that m=
oney being used to redeem nearly $2 billion of its outstanding commercial p=
aper, or short-term corporate IOUs. Ron Barone of credit-rating agency Stan=
dard & Poor's said he believes that Enron was "getting a bit more resistanc=
e" recently in rolling over its commercial paper as it came due. Thus, Enro=
n probably decided it would be easier simply to redeem the paper outstandin=
g, he said.=20
The Enron spokesman yesterday said that paying off the commercial paper and=
 still leaving the company with an additional roughly $1 billion cash on ha=
nd would give it more financial flexibility.=20
Also last week, credit-rating agencies warned investors they were reviewing=
 Enron's debt and commercial-paper ratings for a possible downgrade. A lowe=
r rating could hamper Enron's core trading businesses.=20
Behind the worries among these agencies, in part, is the loss of investor c=
onfidence, which one of the rating companies, Fitch, said in a report last =
week could impair "Enron's financial flexibility and access to capital mark=
ets, therefore impacting its ability to conduct its business."=20
The Enron spokesman said yesterday that the company's trading partners are =
doing business with Enron on "essentially the same terms" as they have in t=
he past. "There has been no significant change in the credit conditions," h=
e said. Trading partners demanding significantly stricter terms from Enron =
would be a sign of further deteriorating confidence in the energy giant's f=
inances.=20
The banks involved in the current negotiations, including J.P. Morgan Chase=
 & Co. and Citigroup Inc., are asking Enron for stricter covenants on the n=
ew credit line than they had asked for in the past, one official said.=20
Bankers involved with the company say the goal of the new credit line is to=
 show the investment community that Enron can meet its commitments. "Confid=
ence in this company was lost," said one bank official involved in the nego=
tiations for a new credit line. "But confidence will be restored."=20
Corporations of Enron's size commonly establish credit lines only to demons=
trate to the investment community that in case of an emergency, they have a=
ccess to cash. In practice, few companies actually make use of these lines.=
 Thus, drawing down credit lines, while providing immediate cash, also illu=
strates the pressure Enron is feeling.

Manager's Journal: How Enron Ran Out of Gas
By Paul Kedrosky

10/29/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A22
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Is troubled Enron Corp. the Long Term Capital Management of the energy mark=
ets, or merely yet another mismanaged company whose executives read too man=
y of their own press releases? Or is poor Enron just misunderstood? Those a=
re the questions after another week of Chinese water torture financial rele=
ases from the beleaguered Houston-based energy concern.=20
A year ago Enron was the hottest of the hot. While tech stocks were tanking=
, Enron's shares gained 89% during 2000. Even die-hard Enron skeptics -- of=
 which there are many -- had to concede that last year was a barnburner for=
 the company. Earnings were up 25%, and revenues more than doubled.
Not bad, considering where the company came from. A decade ago 80% of Enron=
's revenues came from the staid (and regulated) gas-pipeline business. No l=
onger. Enron has been selling those assets steadily, partly fuelling revenu=
es, but also expanding into new areas. By 2000, around 95% of its revenues =
and more than 80% of its profits came from trading energy, and buying and s=
elling stakes in energy producers.=20
The stock market applauded the move: At its peak, Enron was trading at arou=
nd 55 times earnings. That's more like Cisco's once tropospheric valuation =
than the meager 2.5 times earnings the market affords Enron competitor Duke=
 Energy.=20
But Enron management wanted more. It was, after all, a "new economy" Web-ba=
sed energy trader where aggressive performers were lucratively rewarded. Ac=
cording to Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay, the company deserved to be value=
d accordingly. At a conference early this year he told investors the compan=
y's stock should be trading much higher -- say $126, more than double its p=
rice then.=20
Then the new economy motor stalled. The company's president left under stra=
nge circumstances. And rumors swirled about Enron's machinations in Califor=
nia's energy markets. Investors pored over Enron's weakening financial stat=
ements. But Enron analysts must have the energy and persistence of Talmudic=
 scholars to penetrate the company's cryptic financials. In effect, Enron's=
 troubles were hiding in plain sight.=20
It should have been a warning. Because of the poor financial disclosure the=
re was no way to assess the damage the economy was doing to the company, or=
 how it was trying to make its numbers. Most analysts blithely concede that=
 they really didn't know how Enron made money -- in good markets or bad.=20
Not that Enron didn't make money, it did -- albeit with a worrisomely low r=
eturn on equity given the capital required -- but sometimes revenues came f=
rom asset sales and complex off-balance sheet transactions, sometimes from =
energy-trading revenues. And it was very difficult to understand why or how=
 -- or how likely it was Enron could do it again next quarter.=20
Enron's financial inscrutability hid stranger stuff. Deep inside the compan=
y filings was mention of LJM Cayman, L.P., a private investment partnership=
. According to Enron's March 2000 10-K, a "senior officer of Enron is the m=
anaging member" of LJM. Well, that was a puzzler. LJM was helping Enron "ma=
nage price and value risk with regard to certain merchant and similar asset=
s by entering into derivatives, including swaps, puts, and collars." It was=
, in a phrase, Enron's house hedge fund.=20
There is nothing wrong with hedging positions in the volatile energy market=
 -- it is crucial for a market-maker. But having an Enron executive managin=
g and benefiting from the hedging is something else altogether, especially =
when the Enron executive was the company's CFO, Andrew Fastow. While he sev=
ered his connection with LJM (and related partnerships) in July of this yea=
r -- and left Enron in a whirl of confusion last week -- the damage had bee=
n done.=20
As stories in this paper have since made clear, Mr. Fastow's LJM partnershi=
p allegedly made millions from the conflict-ridden, board-approved LJM-Enro=
n relationship. And recently Enron ended the merry affair, taking a billion=
-dollar writedown against equity two weeks ago over some of LJM's wrong-foo=
ted hedging. Analysts, investors, and the Securities & Exchange Commission =
were left with many questions, and very few answers.=20
To be fair, I suppose, Enron did disclose the LJM arrangement more than a y=
ear ago, saying it had erected a Chinese wall between Fastow/LJM and the co=
mpany. And in a bull market, no one paid much attention to what a bad idea =
that horribly conflicted relationship was -- or questioned the strength of =
the wall. Now it matters, as do other Enron-hedged financings, a number of =
which look to have insufficient assets to cover debt repayments due in 2003=
.=20
We didn't do anything wrong is Mr. Lay's refrain in the company's current r=
ound of entertainingly antagonistic conference calls. That remains to be se=
en, but at the very least the company has shown terrible judgment, and hero=
ic arrogance in its dismissal of shareholders interests and financial trans=
parency.=20
Where has Enron's board of directors been through all of this? What kind of=
 oversight has this motley collection of academics, government sorts, and r=
etired executives exercised for Enron shareholders? Very little, it seems. =
It is time Enron's board did a proper investigation, and then cleaned house=
 -- perhaps neatly finishing with themselves.=20

Enron Seeks Additional Financing
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

c. 2001 New York Times Company

DALLAS, Oct. 28 -- The Enron Corporation, still struggling to reassure inve=
stors it can weather a financial crisis over complicated transactions invol=
ving its former chief financial officer, is seeking $1 billion to $2 billio=
n in additional financing from banks, an industry official said today.=20
Last week, Enron, the nation's largest energy-trading concern, used about $=
3 billion in available credit lines and spent about $2 billion to pay off c=
ommercial paper. Now, by obtaining even more financing, Enron is hoping to =
convince investors and other energy-trading firms that it will not face a c=
ash squeeze that could lead trading partners to refuse to extend credit or =
do business with it.
Enron's board, which has been holding meetings by telephone over the last t=
wo weeks to monitor the company's financial situation, held another meeting=
 this afternoon. ''The board is meeting frequently and will announce any ac=
tions when appropriate,'' an Enron spokesman said.=20
Two weeks ago, Enron disclosed that its shareholder equity had been reduced=
 by $1.2 billion because of deals with investment partnerships involving it=
s former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who was ousted last wee=
k. The company also disclosed about $1 billion in separate write-offs, and =
it said last week that the Securities and Exchange Commission had made an i=
nquiry into its financial accounting.=20
Enron hopes to maintain its investment-grade credit rating, which is crucia=
l to ensuring that other energy traders continue to do business with it. La=
tely, Enron's bonds have been trading at prices more like junk bonds, and t=
wo major credit-rating agencies are considering whether to downgrade the co=
mpany's rating.

GLOBAL INVESTING: Enron stock plunge deals a heavy blow to mutual funds=20
Financial Times; Oct 29, 2001
By AGENCIES: AGENCY MATERIAL and ELIZABETH WINE

Enron shares plunged 40 per cent in the last week,doing severe damage to mu=
tual funds, the company's largest institutional ownership bloc, and the hav=
oc may continue.=20
More than 15 per cent of the 4,000 US equity funds held shares in the embat=
tled company's shares as of the most recent reporting period, according to =
fund tracker Morningstar.=20
Mutual funds held a fifth of Enron's shares, but that percentage is likely =
to be much lower now, say fund analysts, who suggest much of the stock's ha=
lving in October is due to large sales by institutional holders.=20
Janus, the growth fund specialist, was the largest institutional shareholde=
r according to the most recent filings, dated June 30, with more than 42m s=
hares representing a stake worth Dollars 2.1bn.=20
The stake - if still held in its entirety - would be worth Dollars 659m at =
Friday's closing price of Dollars 15.40. Enron shares dropped 95 cents, or =
5.81 per cent on Friday, taking its total fall to nearly 41 per cent last w=
eek on concerns over accounting questions and some limited partnerships cre=
ated by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer. On Friday, several l=
eading rating agencies put the company's debt on credit watches, and Enron =
bond prices plunged. The company's stock is down 81 per cent since January.=
=20
Most fund managers, including those at Janus, refuse to discuss a company i=
n which they are actively trading. However, several mutual fund groups with=
 large Enron stakes have said their listed positions are "dated", implying =
that the funds' positions in the company have changed.=20
Morningstar analyst Christine Benz, who follows the Janus funds, said manag=
ers of the group's larger funds had been "lightening up" their Enron holdin=
gs this year. She said Blaine Rollins, who manages the Dollars 23bn flagshi=

Ken Zschappel, manager of the Dollars 11bn Aim Constellation fund, also dec=

COMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron flickers.
By SIMON LONDON and SHEILA MCNULTY.

COMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron flickers - Once a paragon of the new economy, th=
e US energy group is under scrutiny for its opaque accounting and free-whee=
ling management, write Simon London and Sheila McNulty.=20
Enron has some explaining to do. For the past decade or more, the Texas-bas=
ed company has basked in the admiration of investors and business school pr=
ofessors eager to understand its transformation from staid utility to fast-=
growing energy trader. Now it faces scrutiny of a more unwelcome kind.
Its share price has been falling since the beginning of this year. The US S=
ecurities and Exchange Commission is investigating multi-million dollar dea=
ls with a private equity fund associated with its own chief financial offic=
er, which resulted in a $1.2bn reduction in shareholders' equity. A hastily=
-convened conference call last week with analysts raised as many questions =
as it answered about these "related-party transactions". The departure of A=
ndy Fastow, the aforementioned CFO, soon followed.=20
With its credit rating under review by two leading ratings agencies, Enron =
has also been forced to draw down bank credit lines. Yesterday if confirmed=
 it was trying to establish additional lines of liquidity.=20
"This marks the end of Enron's walk on the wild side," observes Curt Launer=
, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment bank.=20
On the surface, events at Enron can be explained by the combination of dete=
riorating trading conditions, a complex capital structure and poor investor=
 relations. But the root causes go back further. The entrepreneurial cultur=
e and dynamic management that fuelled Enron's growth in the 1990s appear to=
 have also sown some of the seeds of the present crisis. Therein may lie a =
cautionary tale for all executives trying to sprinkle "new economy" magic o=
n to old economy companies.=20
Enron's transformation began in earnest in 1990 with the arrival of Jeffrey=
 Skilling, who was hired from McKinsey, the management consulting firm, to =
develop energy trading.=20
For the previous decade Enron had been emerging as a force in the deregulat=
ing US energy markets under the guidance of Kenneth Lay, a former deputy un=
der-secretary of energy. Mr Lay remains chairman. But it was Mr Skilling wh=
o spearheaded the move into trading energy as well as generating and supply=
ing it.=20
The two sides of the business - trading and generation/supply - have always=
 been strange bedfellows. The former demands an entrepreneurial spirit more=
 likely to be found on Wall Street than in a utility. Mr Skilling's answer =
in the early 1990s was to bring in talent from outside the company. One of =
his first recruits was Mr Fastow, an expert in securitisation, the repackag=
ing of financial assets so they can be traded in financial markets.=20
The energy trading division tried from the start to differentiate itself. A=
 management structure was introduced with only four layers - vice-president=
, director, manager and associate/ analyst - much like a consulting firm. E=
mployees were free to take as much holiday as they liked, so long as they d=
elivered results. As one of Mr Skilling's early recruits recalled: "It was =
all about creating an atmosphere and deliberately breaking the rules."=20
The seemingly free-wheeling style was based on a "loose-tight" management m=
odel expounded by Tom Peters and Bob Waterman, the management writers and M=
cKinsey alumni. At Enron this meant that employees in the merchant energy b=
usiness were encouraged by huge bonuses to pursue new ideas and innovate in=
 existing markets.=20
Up-and-coming employees moved freely between projects in pursuit of glory. =
Louise Kitchen, the 32-year-old British executive who was the creative forc=
e behind Enron Online, the group's internet-based trading platform, changed=
 jobs or was promoted seven times in five years.=20
Balancing these loose management practices were tight central control of ri=
sk, legal commitments, finance and performance evaluation/remuneration. Mr =
Skilling once described the approach in this way: "As long as you clear you=
r deals or business ideas through those screens, you can do whatever you wa=
nt around here."=20
This approach did deliver growth and innovation. As well as making markets =
in its core energy products, Enron now trades everything from weather deriv=
atives - which enable companies to insure themselves against unfavourable c=
limatic conditions - to broadband telecommunications capacity and metals. T=
he success of Enron Online allows the group to describe itself as the world=
's leading e-commerce company.=20
It has also started marketing electricity to US consumers through a joint v=
enture with International Business Machines and America Online, the interne=
t service provider.=20
In February this year Mr Skilling got his reward: he became chief executive=
 of a group ranked seventh in Fortune magazine's list of the 500 most power=
ful US corporations - ahead of such corporate giants as IBM, AT&T, Bank of =
America and Boeing.=20
In retrospect, however, this breakneck pace of growth and innovation was ac=
hieved at a price. First was the personal cost to Mr Skilling. In August he=
 abruptly resigned after only six months in the top job. Personal, non-heal=
th related reasons were cited and investors have received no further explan=
ation.=20
A second cost was an enormous increase in financial complexity. In order to=
 avoid a ballooning of assets and liabilities as the group expanded, Enron =
used a range of off-balance sheet vehicles to help finance expansion. LJM, =
the private equity fund in which Mr Fastow played a role, is just one of a =
cast of characters to be found in the footnotes to Enron's accounts. Other =
financing vehicles include Osprey, Marlin, Whitewing, Atlantic Water Trust =
and Azurix. "They went after too many things too quickly," says Stephen Moo=
re of Moody's Investors Service, the credit ratings agency.=20
A third cost, associated with the last, was a loss of financial transparenc=
y. The group's extensive use of swaps, options and other derivative financi=
al instruments in its merchant energy business means that investors have li=
ttle idea of how Enron actually makes its money - or the underlying risks t=
o which it is exposed.=20
David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, summed up the views of many i=
nvestors during last week's conference call. He told the group's management=
: "The company's credibility is being severely questioned and there is a ne=
ed for much more disclosure. There is an appearance that you are hiding som=
ething or that there is something going on beneath the surface that may be =
questionable."=20
The fourth cost was a loss of strategic focus. "The problems, in our view, =
stem from Enron venturing too aggressively in areas outside of its core ski=
lls," argues Raymond Niles, analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "Power plants =
in India, water companies, extension of their franchise to the mass retail =
market, and using a fibre-optic network to deliver content over the interne=
t are all unrelated, or only tangentially related, to their core merchant e=
nergy business."=20
Enron executives also appeared to get carried away with the prospects for s=
ome of these ventures. This time last year Mr Skilling was arguing that Enr=
on Broadband was a business worth $35bn ( #24bn) in its own right. This hel=
ped push the share price to all-time highs - and storing up trouble when tr=
ading volumes failed to materialise.=20
"They over-promised on the new business they created," says Chris Bartlett,=
 a professor at Harvard Business School and long-time watcher of the compan=
y. "Enron was trying to ride the dotcom bubble with Enron Online and the br=
oadband business. To some extent they are now paying the price."=20
Will Enron weather the storm? Notwithstanding the risk of further out-of-th=
e-blue financial shocks, most analysts believe that it will. The merchant e=
nergy business remains powerful and profitable. Mr Niles at Salomon Smith B=
arney points out that this side of the group drives more than 80 per cent o=
f earnings and has shown consistent 30-40 per cent annual growth over the p=
ast three years. Assets totalling more than $4bn were also earmarked for di=
sposal before the current crisis erupted, underlining that there is plenty =
of realisable value within the group's portfolio of physical energy assets.=
=20
And yet the doubts remain. It is, ultimately, a question of confidence and =
credibility. Investors suspect that the balance between loose and tight man=
agement methods has tilted too far towards the former. Mr Lay and his team =
will have to tighten up.=20

Enron, the troubled US energy group, was attempting yesterday to persuade b=
anks to provide additional credit to bolster its position after a sharp fal=
l in its share price.=20
The Houston-based company was also due last night to hold a special board m=
eeting to consider confidence-building measures after surprise financial di=
sclosures damaged its reputation among US investors.
Last week the company raised $3.3bn (Euros 3.7bn) in cash to bolster its fi=
nancial position but Enron admitted yesterday that it was still looking for=
 additional finance. The company insisted, however, that it was in good fin=
ancial health and that its core energy trading business remained strong.=20
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said he hoped the company would have somet=
hing to announce in coming days from its latest effort to "establish additi=
onal lines of liquidity". "Once we are able to get the liquidity position s=
hored up, that will put a lot of fears of the unknown to rest," Mr Palmer s=
aid.=20
The company's problems have become public since an announcement on October =
16 that it would take a $1.01bn special charge and write down shareholders'=
 equity by another $1.2bn. The moves followed losses arising from a private=
 equity operation run by Andrew Fastow, its former chief financial officer,=
 who was forced to take a leave of absence last week.=20
Enron's share price has fallen more than 50 per cent since the October 16 a=
nnouncement and its bonds have been trading at levels that are technically =
"junk" status, though its official ratings are still investment grade.=20
"Our concern is that a reduction in the debt rating could impair their abil=
ity to operate their trading and marketing operations," said Raymond Niles =
of Salomon Smith Barney. "These activities require at least an investment g=
rade credit rating, or Enron could be subject to an increase in margin requ=

Enron Seeks Further Credit to Reassure Investors, WSJ Says
2001-10-29 04:30 (New York)


     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, asked banks to provide a further credit line of as
much as $2 billion in a bid to restore investor confidence in the
company, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified
officials close to negotiations.

     The new credit line is additional to the $3.3 billion credit
line it tapped last week, the paper said, and should be completed
within days.

     Investors have shunned the company since Oct. 16 when Enron
reported a third quarter loss of $618 million and wrote down
shareholders' equity by another $1.2 billion, the Journal said.
The stock has fallen by 54 percent since the announcement.

     The company's shares were further dented after an investor
sued Enron last month, saying dealings with two partnerships run
by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, cost the company
$35 million. The suit also called Fastow's leadership of the
partnerships, set up to cut Enron's debt, a conflict of interest.



USA: REPEAT-Electric cowboys get roped in at the energy corral.
By Janet McGurty

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Last year, Enron Corp. was a darling of invest=
ors and analysts, but the freewheeling trader of electricity and natural ga=
s now faces a credibility crisis due to a lack of transparency in its busin=
ess dealings.=20
Enron, trying to shake investor jitters over a possible downgrade of its cr=
edit worthiness and their unease over the company's complex financial trans=
actions, has seen its shares shed more than half their market value in the =
past week.
But the largest natural gas and electricity marketer in the United States i=
s not alone in getting its wings clipped as energy prices come down and the=
 market volatility that drove earnings last year eases.=20
While Enron's problems differ from more traditional utilities, many other p=
ower producers are returning to their roots. They are scrapping plans for s=
plitting operations and questioning whether more risky overseas operations =
can be supported by lower prices brought on by a slowing economy.=20
Paul Patterson, an energy analyst with ABN Amro, said there are common them=
es affecting the industry.=20
"One is lower power prices and the margins that are associated with them. A=
nd two is lower stock prices and the ability to finance more asset driven g=
rowth," Patterson said.=20
As earnings fall and forward earnings guidance is revised downward, some po=
wer companies are seeking strategies to address the bleaker environment. An=
d plans to spin off units have been postponed or called off.=20
Shares of Enron slid $1.05, or 6.4 percent, to $15.30 in afternoon trade on=
 the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.=20
THE WORLD HAS CHANGED=20
AES Corp. , a global power producer whose earnings fell for a second consec=
utive quarter on a poor showing from operations in Brazil and Britain, said=
 Thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out selling off=
 assets.=20
"It's a different place," AES' chief executive officer Dennis Bakke said of=
 the business climate facing utilities today compared with last year's powe=
rful growth. On Friday, Constellation Energy Group , parent company of Balt=
imore Gas & Electric, scrapped plans to split its power generation and trad=
ing operations into two company because of economic changes. Constellation =
also hired a new chief executive and severed ties with Goldman Sachs, which=
 planned to make an equity investment in the company.=20
"The utility industry and energy markets, and indeed the entire U.S. econom=
y, have changed considerably in the past year. As a combined company, we wi=
ll be better positioned to seize opportunities to grow and deliver," said C=
hristian Poindexter, Constellation's chairman.=20
RETURN TO TRADITIONAL VALUES=20
Bakke said one prong of AES's brave, new world scenario was a renewed empha=
sis on the traditionally profitable, long-term contract generation business=
.=20
It makes sense for power generating companies to sign about 75 percent to 8=
0 percent of their generating capacity into long-term contracts because it =
provides stability and a level of profitability in a period of flat growth,=
 according to Gordon Howald, energy analyst with Credit Lyonnaise.=20
"Calpine does it already," he said, referring to the California-based indep=
endent power producer that has the lion's share of the power it generates c=
ontracted out. "What drove the valuations in all these companies last year =
was that power markets were very inefficient. Physical reserve margins were=
 low. But with flat to down demand in 2001 - as it appears to be the case -=
 there is very little to lead us to believe that power prices will be anywh=
ere near that level," he added.=20
Howald said with all the new generation coming on, natural gas prices shoul=
d remain high but power prices should come down further, squeezing spark sp=

The Texas energy and telecommunications giant Enron Corp. was reportedly ne=
gotiating with its lenders about new credit lines Friday, a day after it dr=
ew down billions on its existing lines.=20
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are the two banking companies wi=
th the largest lending exposure to the $67 billion-asset Houston company, w=
ith an estimated $400 to $500 million in bank debt outstanding "in addition=
 to derivatives and other structured product exposures," according to Goldm=
an Sachs Group Inc. analyst Lori Applebaum.
Morgan Chase and Citi were the book runners on a 364-day, $2.25 billion loa=
n facility to Enron that closed in May, according to Thomson Financial Secu=
rities Data. Credit Suisse First Boston was the sole bookrunner on a $582 m=
illion loan to the company that closed in March and matures in March 2004, =
the data company said. Bank of America, Citigroup, and Deutsche Bank also p=
articipated, Securities Data said.=20
On Thursday, Enron issued a statement that "in order to dispel uncertainty =
in the financial community," it had drawn on its committed lines of credit =
to provide over $1 billion of cash liquidity. The Wall Street Journal repor=
ted on Friday that Enron drew down about $3 billion from a credit line and =
was in talks about obtaining a new multibillion-dollar line.=20
"We continue to have conversations new our creditors about new liquidity --=
 that's nothing out of the ordinary," said Enron spokesman Eric Thode.=20
The developments followed a $638 million loss for the third quarter, the de=
parture of Enron's chief financial officer, and a Securities and Exchange C=
ommission inquiry.=20
Enron, a natural gas company that has broadened its focus to include energy=
 trading, transport, risk-management, and telecommunications products and s=
ervices, has relationships with banks that extend beyond credit lines.=20
"Citi, J.P. Morgan, and possibly Wachovia and Bank of America also invested=
 along with Enron in some of its partnerships," said Ms. Applebaum. A spoke=
sman for Morgan Chase confirmed that the bank was a lender but said he did =
not know the amount of its exposure.=20
Many other regional banks have participated in credit facilities to Enron. =
Bank of America Corp. is estimated to have about $200 million to $300 milli=
on of exposure; Bank One Corp. about $100 million; and Wachovia Corp., SunT=
rust Banks Inc., and FleetBoston Financial Corp. about $50 million each, ac=
cording to Goldman Sachs estimates. Bank of New York has between $50 to $10=
0 million of exposure, and Northern Trust, U.S. Bancorp and KeyCorp also ha=
ve some lending exposure, Ms. Applebaum said.=20
Representatives of these banks would not comment on their relationships wit=
h Enron, or did not return phone calls by deadline.

JAPAN: Japan's Teijin, Enron study coal-fired power plant.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

TOKYO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Japan's major polyester manufacturer, Teijin Ltd =
, said on Monday it would conduct a feasibility study with U.S. energy gian=
t Enron Corp on building a coal-fired power plant.=20
Teijin said in a statement that it and E Power Corp, a Japanese affiliate o=
f Enron Corp, would look into building the 70,000 kilowatt coal-burning the=
rmal power plant in Matsuyama, Ehime prefecture, on the southwestern island=
 of Shikoku, where Teijin has a polyester plant.
"We are beginning to consider selling surplus power to third parties other =
than our own plants, with eyes on further deregulation in Japan's power mar=
ket," a Teijin spokesman said.=20
Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market. Since March last =
year, large-lot consumers have been free to choose their suppliers.=20
In its polyester business, Teijin has expanded overseas output while reduci=
ng domestic production, a trend which would leave it with surplus power. It=
 is thus looking at how to make good use of any surplus.=20
The two firms were also considering expanding the capacity of Teijin's exis=
ting power generator in Matsuyama, Teijin said. It hopes to reduce costs at=
 the inefficient small plant with the help of Enron.=20
Enron Corp said earlier this year it had presented plans to build a liquefi=
ed natural gas (LNG) fired power plant in northern Japan, aiming to become =
the first foreign company to build such a power plant in Japan.=20
The Teijin spokesman said the two firms hoped to conclude the feasibility s=
tudy by June 2002.=20
Teijin's shares ended the day down 13 yen or 2.68 percent at 472 yen.

Enron, Teijin to Build Power Plant in Japan, Report Says
2001-10-28 23:39 (New York)


     Tokyo, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. and Teijin Ltd.
will jointly build a coal-fired power plant in southwestern Japan
as early as 2004, the Nihon Keizai newspaper said on its wire
service, without citing sources.

     Enron, the world's biggest energy trader, and synthetic-
fiber maker Teijin will together spend 1 billion yen ($8.16
million) to build the 70,000-kilowatt plant in Ehime, southwest of
Tokyo, the report said.

     Enron wants to eventually build bigger plants and sell
electricity directly to large commercial users without going
through exiting utilities, the report said.

Once-Mighty Enron Strains Under Scrutiny
By ALEX BERENSON and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

10/28/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

IS time running out for Enron?=20
At the beginning of this year, the Enron Corporation, the world's dominant =
energy trader, appeared unstoppable. The company's decade-long effort to pe=
rsuade lawmakers to deregulate electricity markets had succeeded from Calif=
ornia to New York. Its ties to the Bush administration assured that its vie=
ws would be heard in Washington. Its sales, profits and stock were soaring.
And under the leadership of Jeffrey K. Skilling, its chief executive, Enron=
's arrogance had grown even more quickly.=20
The company, based in Houston, dripped contempt for the regulators and cons=
umer groups that stood between it and fully deregulated markets -- for elec=
tricity, water and everything else. Everyone would win under deregulation, =
Enron said -- especially its shareholders, whose stock would soar as the co=
mpany profited from creating new markets.=20
''We are on the side of angels,'' Mr. Skilling said in March, dismissing th=
ose who saw the company as a profiteer in California's energy crisis. ''Peo=
ple want to have open, competitive markets. They want fair competition. It'=
s the American way.''=20
But less than a year later, everybody seems to have lost, especially Enron'=
s investors. Enron's stock is plunging, and questions about its finances ar=
e mounting.=20
Some experts in the energy industry worry that if the crisis at the company=
 worsens, trading in natural gas and electricity could be seriously disrupt=
ed and energy prices could grow more volatile. In a worst-case outlook, Enr=
on could become the 2001 version of Long-Term Capital Management, the huge =
hedge fund whose collapse roiled financial markets during the fall of 1998.=
 Enron's shares have fallen more than 80 percent this year, erasing $50 bil=
lion in shareholder value.=20
Enron closed on Friday at $15.40, down 95 cents, after hitting a 52-week lo=
w of $15.04 earlier in the day.=20
The future of electricity deregulation is in doubt, thanks to blackouts and=
 soaring power prices in California earlier this year -- a crisis that ende=
d only when that state contradicted deregulation's basic tenets by interven=
ing deeply in the power market. Enron's efforts to become a profit-making w=
ater supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capaci=
ty have been expensive failures. In August, Mr. Skilling quit, forcing Kenn=
eth L. Lay, his predecessor as chief executive and still Enron's chairman, =
to resume day-to-day control of the company.=20
The company declined to make senior executives, including Mr. Lay, availabl=
e for comment, and asked that questions be submitted in writing. Mr. Skilli=
ng could not be reached.=20
Enron's problems boiled over earlier this month, when it disclosed that its=
 shareholders' equity, a measure of the company's value, dropped by $1.2 bi=
llion in the last quarter because of a deal disclosed only very hazily in E=
nron's regular financial statements. The Securities and Exchange Commission=
 is looking into the company's financial reporting, and some investors ques=
tion whether Enron has overstated profits at its primary business of tradin=
g electricity and natural gas.=20
THE slump in the company's shares accelerated after Enron revealed the fall=
 in its shareholders' equity. On Wednesday, the company forced out its chie=
f financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who is at the center of the controve=
rsy over Enron's confusing finances. The company, which six months ago seem=
ed to be reaping billions of dollars from California's energy crisis, today=
 faces a potential cash crunch.=20
The surprise about shareholder equity inflamed investors' smoldering concer=
n about Enron's opaque financial statements. Now, with Wall Street analysts=
 and bond-rating agencies demanding more information about the complex tran=
sactions that have fueled the company's profits, Enron has been reduced to =
issuing news releases assuring investors that it has adequate access to cas=
h.=20
Enron does not appear to be in immediate danger of running out of cash. On =
Thursday, the company drew down a $3.3 billion credit line it had previousl=
y arranged with a group of banks led by Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase, w=
hich have each extended at least $400 million. But because of Enron's impor=
tance in the natural gas and electricity markets, industry experts say that=
 any problem at the company could disrupt energy trading nationwide.=20
The supply of natural gas and electricity would probably not be affected ev=
en if the company failed, because Enron is mainly a trader, rather than a p=
roducer, of energy. But a crisis at the company might increase the volatili=
ty of energy prices, which have swung wildly in the last year.=20
Philip K. Verleger Jr., an energy-markets economist, emphasized that he tho=
ught Enron would survive this crisis. But he said it was not clear what wou=
ld happen if Enron ran out of cash or if traders that use the company's Enr=
onOnline Internet trading marketplace defaulted on their obligations.=20
''You suddenly have all these positions they have taken on there -- are the=
y good? Are the firm's hedges good? What's the situation?'' Mr. Verleger sa=
id. ''It's got everyone scared.''=20
In the short run, Enron's credit rating may be its biggest problem. If the =
company's rating falls below investment grade, Enron could be forced to iss=
ue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover loans that it has guarantee=
d. But creating new shares would make the shares that already exist less va=
luable, because those shares would no longer represent full ownership of th=
e company.=20
A drop in the company's credit rating could also prompt other energy trader=
s and producers to back away from doing business with Enron, hurting the co=
mpany's sales and profits.=20
Enron's credit rating stands several notches above the critical point. But =
its bonds, which are publicly traded, have fallen so low that they are now =
offering interest rates of almost 10 percent, comparable with many junk bon=
ds. Two of the three major credit-rating agencies, Moody's Investors Servic=
e and Fitch Investors Service, have put Enron's bonds on review for possibl=
e downgrades.=20
''The issue that's in the front of everybody's mind right now is credit,'' =
said Mark Gurley, senior vice president and general manager for trading at =
Aquila Inc., one of the nation's largest energy traders. Aquila is based in=
 Kansas City, Mo.=20
For now, Aquila and other major energy traders and producers, including Rel=
iant Energy, the El Paso Corporation and Dynegy, are continuing to do busin=
ess with Enron. And Mr. Gurley said that Enron's own trading in the electri=
city and natural gas markets did not suggest the sort of frenzied selling r=
eminiscent of the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998.=20
''They haven't done anything trading-wise that gives me any indication they=
 are closing their books down,'' he said.=20
Still, some executives at other companies said they were looking more caref=
ully at transactions with Enron, especially long-term contracts. They also =
said risk-management and credit officers were calling each other regularly =
to discuss the situation.=20
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said on Friday that no energy-trading comp=
any had stopped doing business with Enron. He declined to say whether any o=
f the company's trading partners had suspended or altered credit terms. He =
said the company was continuing to see normal volumes of business.=20
But the crisis that Enron will face if its credit rating is downgraded is j=
ust a symptom of the bigger problem the company must confront. For years, t=
he details of Enron's finances have been a mystery even to the Wall Street =
analysts whose job it is to follow the company, and to the investors who ow=
n its stock and bonds. When Enron's profits were soaring and it was creatin=
g lucrative new markets, shareholders did not seem to care about the impene=
trability of its financial statements.=20
Now they do. Yet the company seems incapable of offering straight answers t=
o the questions investors ask.=20
To others in the industry, the opaqueness of the company's financial statem=
ents parallels Enron's efforts to keep its energy-trading business lightly =
regulated and free of disclosure requirements. Though they do not expect En=
ron to crumble like Long-Term Capital Management, they say that, like the g=
iant hedge fund, Enron uses a lot of debt, regulatory oversight is limited =
and outsiders have a difficult time figuring out its finances.=20
The most pressing concerns are a series of partnerships and trusts Enron cr=
eated to move some of its assets and debt off its balance sheet. With names=
 like Marlin and Osprey, the partnerships have at least $3.3 billion in bon=
ds outstanding, backed by assets like a stake in Azurix, Enron's water comp=
any subsidiary. Enron has promised that if the partnerships' debts exceed t=
he value of their assets, Enron will issue enough new shares to make up the=
 difference.=20
DEALS with partnerships formed by Mr. Fastow, who was chief financial offic=
er when they were organized, led to the $1.2 billion write-off in sharehold=
ers' equity that Enron announced last week. The company has offered only sk=
impy details of its transactions with those partnerships.=20
Enron ended its relationships with those partnerships in the last quarter, =
after being criticized by shareholders. In the process, it wrote off a prom=
issory note that it had carried on its books, reducing its shareholders' eq=
uity by $1.2 billion. But, because of complex accounting rules, the transac=
tion was not apparent in Enron's quarterly earnings report.=20
The transaction disturbs investors because it suggests that Enron may have =
found a way to hide losses, throwing the accuracy of its financial statemen=
ts into question. When Enron released third-quarter earnings on Oct. 16, it=
 reported a loss from $1 billion in write-offs on failed investments. The e=
arnings statement did not mention the additional $1.2 billion equity write-=
down. But the company said its core business had been solidly profitable, a=
nd its shares rose.=20
In a conference call with analysts after the announcement, Mr. Lay, Enron's=
 chairman, also disclosed the reduction in shareholder equity. The referenc=
e was a brief one, however, and some listeners did not catch it. Those anal=
ysts were angered when they found out the next day what Enron had done, and=
 many were confused by the accounting procedure. Enron's stock began to sli=
de, and investors clamored for more information about the write-off. But so=
 far, the company's efforts to clear up the situation have further unnerved=
 investors.=20
Mr. Lay has met with investors during the last two weeks to try to explain =
the deals, but some on Wall Street say they have come away with doubts abou=
t Mr. Lay's grasp of the situation. They say that the two people at Enron w=
ho appear to have been most knowledgeable about the deals -- Mr. Skilling a=
nd Mr. Fastow -- have both left the company.=20
In an interview in late August, Mr. Lay said he did not know some details a=
bout the deals involving Mr. Fastow. In response to one question about them=
, he said, ''You're getting way over my head.''=20
Mr. Palmer of Enron disputed any suggestion that Mr. Lay did not have a gra=
sp of the investments at issue, saying Mr. Lay was handicapped in talking a=
bout them because of the S.E.C. investigation. ''There is not a whole lot w=
e can say, or should say, about them,'' Mr. Palmer said. He also said the c=
ompany expected to generate about $3 billion in cash through asset sales by=
 the end of next year.=20
In a conference call on Tuesday, analysts pressed Mr. Lay and other top Enr=
on executives to reveal more information about the LJM write-down and its o=
ther partnerships. Instead, they offered only vague explanations of the dea=
l, leaving Wall Street worried that more write-offs might be coming.=20
David Fleischer, a Goldman, Sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the c=
ompany, was among those who came away concerned. ''If Enron is unable to cl=
arify its off-balance-sheet transactions and restore confidence in the very=
 near term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming tha=
t would affect the balance sheet or liquidity position, then the company wi=
ll likely lose access to the capital markets,'' he wrote in a research note=
 after the call.=20
To try to reassure investors, Enron said late Thursday that EnronOnline, it=
s Internet-based trading exchange, executed more than 8,400 trades that day=
, a higher-than-normal volume.=20
''We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibil=
ity with the investment community -- and we're working on that,'' Mr. Lay s=
aid in a statement. ''But in the meantime, the best evidence of our strengt=
h is the willingness of customers to bring their business to Enron.''=20
But those reassurances apparently are no longer enough for Wall Street. Enr=
on's stock tumbled almost 6 percent Friday, to its lowest levels in six yea=
rs.=20
Now analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of Enron's off-balance=
-sheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new =
shares to make good on its partnership guarantees.=20
Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston, calculates tha=
t Enron may have close to $9 billion in off-balance-sheet debt. She said th=
at Enron had for two years been trying to sell about $6 billion in foreign =
assets -- including properties in Latin America and a power plant in India =
embroiled in a dispute with the state government -- and she worries about t=
hose prospects for sale in light of Enron's problems and the souring econom=
y.=20
''As Enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their =
backs, they may have to write those assets down,'' Ms. Coale said. On Wedne=
sday, she downgraded her rating on Enron to ''sell'' from ''neutral.''=20
''The bottom line is, it's really difficult to recommend an investment when=
 management does not disclose the facts,'' Ms. Coale said.=20
Short-sellers, who attacked Enron's accounting even before the company disc=
losed the write-off, say the company's problems may run even deeper than an=
alysts fear. Enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance money=
-losing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business, they s=
ay.=20
''The company still isn't disclosing enough to know whether the core busine=
ss, the trading business, is profitable,'' said Mark Roberts, director of r=
esearch at Off Wall Street, which recommended shorting Enron's stock on May=
 7, when it stood at $59.43. ''The issue remains: why are they doing these =
transactions? Our theory has been that the core operations aren't that prof=
itable.''=20
James Chanos, a leading short-seller who has bet that Enron's stock will fa=
ll, said, ''Is Enron booking gains when it has real profits, but hiding the=
 losses when deals go against it?'' Mr. Palmer of Enron said the company st=
ood by its reported energy-trading profits.=20
Even traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture=
 of Enron's positions. Enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wip=
ed out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its tr=
ading book balanced -- meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset, =
in roughly equivalent amounts, by energy it has agreed to buy.=20
''With these guys, they tell us -- and all you've got is their word -- that=
 they're hedged,'' said Mr. Verleger, the economist.=20
IN fact, Enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation an=
d disclosure of its trading operations. Last year, the company successfully=
 lobbied Congress to effectively ensure that its Internet-trading platform =
would be exempted from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commissi=
on.=20
Enron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the=
 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that oversees wholesale e=
lectricity and natural gas markets. But the commission does not keep track =
of specific transactions and prices.=20
Large-scale energy trading has existed for only about a half-dozen years. E=
nron pioneered the business, and now dominates it, accounting for about one=
-quarter of all trading in the United States.=20
Before Congress and federal regulators opened up the market for wholesale e=
lectricity, a process that began in earnest a decade ago, the power busines=
s was a simpler affair. Utilities were given areas of monopoly service, and=
 their rates -- and ability to deliver enough electricity -- were overseen =
by state regulators. But with the move to deregulate the business, independ=
ent and unregulated generators and traders have flourished, providing an ev=
er-growing portion of the nation's power.=20
Beginning in the 1980's, the sale and transportation of natural gas was als=
o deregulated, spurring Enron, which used to be primarily a gas-pipeline co=
mpany, to move into the trading business.=20
The company's shift to trading gas and electricity accelerated in the mid-1=
990's, with the ascension of Mr. Skilling, who became chief executive in Fe=
bruary, just six months before his unexpected resignation. Underscoring the=
 change in direction, in securities filings this year Enron described its p=
rincipal business as ''security brokers, dealers and flotation.'' Before, i=
t had said it was in the business of ''wholesale-petroleum and petroleum pr=
oducts.''=20
For most of its ascent, Enron reported outstanding profit figures and Wall =
Street accepted them with pleasure. A year ago, when it disclosed the first=
 transactions with partnerships led by Mr. Fastow, the company's former chi=
ef financial officer, analysts who asked questions were told that the deals=
 were routine and were being disclosed only because of Mr. Fastow's involve=
ment.=20
Enron does not appear to face an immediate cash crunch. But the bank credit=
 lines that it drew on last week to pay off its short-term debt will have t=
o be renegotiated next spring. The controversial partnerships do not have t=
o pay their debts until the following year -- unless Enron loses its invest=
ment-grade credit rating before that.=20
ENRON will also need to maintain its large trading positions, which could s=
uffer if participants in those markets grow more nervous about Enron's cred=
it. When Long-Term Capital was stumbling in 1998, some Wall Street rivals s=
old the securities they thought Long-Term owned, trying to force Long-Term =
to sell its positions quickly and at a loss. Something similar in energy ma=
rkets might be possible. If so, Enron might find, as Long-Term did, that po=
sitions that should offset each other do not.=20
Enron's new chief financial officer may yet persuade investors that in fact=
 the company's profits are real, and that its condition is better than the =
short-sellers believe. As questions are answered, confidence, and the share=
 price, could rebound.=20
But for now, investors are skittish, and some competitors are eager to take=
 advantage of Enron's plight.

Plumbing Mystery Of Deals By Enron

AT the heart of the sudden collapse in investor confidence in the Enron Cor=
poration are unusual trades it entered into with partnerships led by its ch=
ief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, beginning in the summer of 1999. B=
ecause they were transactions among related parties, the company was requir=
ed to disclose them, but the disclosures raised as many questions as they a=
nswered. Following are some questions that investors are asking, and the cu=
rrently available answers.=20
Q. Why did Enron enter into the deals?
A. Enron's first disclosures, in 1999, gave no reason. In later reports, it=
 said it was seeking to ''hedge certain merchant investments and other asse=
ts,'' by which it apparently meant investments in technology and telecommun=
ications companies.=20
Q. How did those investments do?=20
A. It looks as if they plunged in value, although there is no clear disclos=
ure on that.=20
Q. Why can't that be discerned?=20
A. The company never said just what the investments were. And the transacti=
ons with the partnerships were complicated, involving a variety of derivati=
ve securities, Enron stock and various promissory notes. Enron's financial =
disclosures do not provide enough information to understand the arrangement=
s completely.=20
Q. Why were they so complicated?=20
A. One reason may have been to use accounting rules to its advantage. One a=
ccounting rule dictates that companies may not record profits or losses on =
transactions in their own stock. If a company sells its shares at $10 each =
and then buys them back -- whether for $1 or $50 -- there is no gain or los=
s. But shareholder equity does go up or down on the balance sheet -- in tha=
t case reflecting how much extra cash the company took in, or paid out, on =
the transactions. Enron's transactions appear to have been structured to fa=
ll under that rule.=20
Q. Who made money from these transactions?=20
A. Enron reported some profits along the way from the deals, although not a=
ll of the profits were spelled out in its quarterly filings. And it appears=
 that the partnerships distributed money to investors.=20
Q. If the deals began in 1999, why all the uproar now?=20
A. Many investors and analysts were not curious about them when everything =
seemed to be going well. As long as Enron was exceeding its forecasted prof=
its each quarter, they were willing to assume that what was not being discl=
osed was not really important.=20
Q. When were concerns raised with Enron?=20
A. The complaints grew as Enron's share price fell earlier this year. By th=
is summer, Enron decided that Mr. Fastow would sell his stake in the partne=
rships. Then, because the partnerships would no longer be considered relate=
d to Enron, the company would no longer have to disclose anything about the=
 transactions. But investors were still worried, and Enron later closed out=
 its deals with the partnerships.=20
Q. How did Enron do?=20
A. Badly. It took a $35 million loss, which, given the size of the transact=
ions involved and the previous profits taken, was not very much. But it als=
o reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.=20
Q. How did that happen?=20
A. That, like so much else, is not clear. But it looks as if the partnershi=
p owed Enron that much money, could not pay and was let off the hook by Enr=
on. In return, Enron terminated ''previously recorded contractual obligatio=
ns to deliver Enron shares in future periods.'' Enron treated that like a s=
hare buyback, even though the shares in question had not been issued, and d=
etermined that there was no need to treat it as a loss that would reduce re=
ported earnings.=20
Q. Is that legal under the accounting rules?=20
A. Presumably it is. But Enron's limited disclosures make it impossible to =
say for sure. Enron may have discovered ways to use the accounting rules to=
 enable it to keep losses off income statements, while leaving profits on t=
hem. That may become clearer when the Securities and Exchange Commission, w=
hich has begun preliminary inquiries, completes its work. FLOYD NORRIS

Enron Asks Banks for More Credit After Stock Slide, FT Reports
2001-10-28 20:20 (New York)

     Houston, Oct. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, asked banks to provide further credit after tapping
a $3.3 billion credit line last week to bolster investor
confidence, the Financial Times reported, citing company sources.

     Enron's stock has fallen more than 50 percent since Oct. 17
when an investor sued the company for conflict of interest over
transactions with affiliates run by Enron's former Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow.

     The company has been shut out of the leading market for low-
interest, short-term loans since announcing Oct. 16 it would take
a $1.01 billion special charge and write down shareholders' equity
by another $1.2 billion, the FT said.

     Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said he hoped the company would
announce the new financing facility in coming days, the newspaper
said.

Enron Taps All Its Credit Lines To Buy Back $3.3 Billion of Debt
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/27/2001
The New York Times
Page 2, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

The Enron Corporation, trying to reassure investors that it has ample liqui=
dity, began to repurchase all its outstanding commercial paper yesterday, u=
sing $3.3 billion it borrowed from banks by depleting its lines of credit.=
=20
An Enron spokesman said that when the commercial paper repurchases are comp=
leted the company will retain more than $1 billion in cash.
The moves did not appear to reassure investors, as Enron's share price fell=
 to another six-year low. Shares traded as low as $15.04 yesterday, before =
ending the day at $15.40, down 95 cents.=20
The move will raise the interest expense for the company, because banks nor=
mally charge more than companies have to pay in the commercial paper market=
, and because its outstanding debt will rise by the additional $1 billion.=
=20
Enron's debt is rated investment grade. But its bonds now trade below inves=
tment grade levels, although not so low that it appears investors fear an e=
arly default. But with the bonds trading so low, it is unlikely Enron will =
be able to sell more commercial paper.=20
Enron's stock has been plunging since Oct. 17, shortly after it disclosed t=
hat its third-quarter balance sheet, which has yet to be released, will sho=
w a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity as a result of complicated=
 transactions involving partnerships formerly controlled by Andrew Fastow, =
who was the company's chief financial officer until he was replaced on Wedn=
esday.=20
The stock has lost more than half its value since the earnings announcement=
, and the company has disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission=
 has asked questions about its accounting practices.

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Enron's bond prices drop to warning lev=
els.
By ROBERT CLOW, SHEILA MCNULTY and JENNY WIGGINS.

10/27/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Enron, the Houston-based energy trading group, continued to pay a heavy pri=
ce for its lack of financial transparency yesterday as its bond prices plum=
meted.=20
Investor confidence in Enron has declined sharply since the company announc=
ed a $1.2bn reduction of shareholder equity stemming from a complex off-bal=
ance sheet structure. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also launc=
hed an informal investigation into the company's finances.
Enron's five-year bonds were trading yesterday at 77 cents in the dollar wi=
th a yield of 11.13 per cent, down from 83 cents on Thursday. Bond prices a=
t these levels normally suggest that investors expect a company to file for=
 bankruptcy.=20
Late on Thursday, Enron announced that it would draw on its bank lines to b=
uy back its outstanding commercial paper after two ratings agencies put the=
 company on negative watch.=20
Commercial paper financing, which normally has to be rolled every 90 days, =
is one of the first forms of financing to disappear in a crisis.=20
"What they want to do is assure their clients and other trading partners th=
at they are creditworthy and continue with business," said Robin West, chai=
rman of the Petroleum Finance Company, the industry consultants. "In a situ=
ation like this, cash is king."=20
Enron's biggest immediate business risk is that its major trading counterpa=
rties, such as Duke Energy and Reliant Resources, start asking it for more =
collateral, increasing the cost of its everyday business.=20
If Enron were downgraded to junk, the counterparties could do just that.=20
So far, credit rating analysts say, Enron's core business is holding up wel=
l. But their actions over the past few days acknowledge that the company co=

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares fell after the largest energy trade=
r tapped a $3-billion credit line because it has been shut out of the leadi=
ng market for low-interest, short-term loans.=20
The company's stock has fallen 54% in the last 14 days after investors ques=
tioned its transactions with affiliates run by Enron's former chief financi=
al officer. The shares fell 95 cents, or 5.8%, to $15.40 on the New York St=
ock Exchange.
Investors said Chief Executive Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure them that=
 the company's credit rating won't be cut. Enron can no longer borrow in co=
mmercial paper markets, where short-term loans carry lower rates than banks=
 offer.=20
"Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No," said John Cassa=
dy, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth Third Bancorp. "People ar=
e questioning the credibility of management."=20
The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion in commercial =
paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.=20
The price of Enron's 6.75% bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 11/2 point=
s to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86 cents. At that pric=
e, the bonds, which carry a rating of BBB+, yield 9.53%.=20
Investors have grown concerned that the firm's credit rating will be cut af=
ter $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from failed investments. Enron ne=
eds good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding=
 collateral and to settle transactions.=20
Enron's decision to tap its credit line was "a smart financial move," said =
Stephen Moore of Moody's Investors Service. "It took away the hassle and ti=
me-consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and insured access to capit=

Now Enron will begin repurchasing its commercial paper. This is a way for c=

"To some extent, redeeming the commercial paper is at the expense of the ca=

In a worst-case scenario, investor fears could create a vicious cycle that =
continues to drive the stock down, which would force bond rating agencies t=
o consider downgrades of Enron. That could lead to lower credit ratings, wh=

the company and cut back on business with it.=20
"Thus, we see a big incentive for Enron to clarify the issues," Dietert wro=

Enron says Microsoft breached contract

Enron Corp. filed suit against Microsoft Corp. in state district court in H=

The companies entered into an agreement last June in which Enron would prov=
ide Internet bandwidth to Microsoft as it rolled out its MSN Broadband serv=

Qwest Communications is providing the Internet infrastructure in 14 other s=

On Oct. 23, Microsoft said that Enron would have breached the contract if i=

loomberg News. In the lawsuit, Enron claims Microsoft failed to deliver the=
 ordering and billing system it needed to deliver its end of the project's =
first phase.=20
The lawsuit appears to be blocking the launch of the MSN service in all but=
 the 14 states served by Qwest.=20
Enron officials declined to comment. A Microsoft spokesman said the company=
 had not reviewed the filing but was "confident that we have upheld our agr=

How to Lose a War
By Frank Rich

10/27/2001
The New York Times
Page 19, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Welcome back to Sept. 10.=20
The ''America Strikes Back'' optimism that surged after Sept. 11 has now be=
en stricken by the multitude of ways we're losing the war at home. The F.B.=
I. has proved more effective in waging turf battles against Rudy Giuliani t=
han waging war on terrorism. Of the more than 900 suspects arrested, exactl=
y zero have been criminally charged in the World Trade Center attack (thoug=
h one has died of natural causes, we're told, in a New Jersey jail cell). T=
he Bush team didn't fully recognize that a second attack on America had beg=
un until more than a week after the first casualty. The most highly trumpet=
ed breakthrough in the hunt for anthrax terrorists -- Tom Ridge's announcem=
ent that ''the site where the letters were mailed'' had been found in New J=
ersey -- proved a dead end. And now the president is posing with elementary=
-school children again.
Given that this is the administration that was touted as being run with C.E=
.O. clockwork, perhaps it should be added to the growing list of Things Tha=
t Have Changed Forever since Sept. 11. But let's not be so hasty. Not every=
thing changes that fast -- least of all Washington. The White House's home-=
front failures are not sudden, unpredictable products of wartime confusion =
but direct products of an ethos that has been in place since Jan. 20.=20
This is an administration that will let its special interests -- particular=
ly its high-rolling campaign contributors and its noisiest theocrats of the=
 right -- have veto power over public safety, public health and economic pr=
udence in war, it turns out, no less than in peacetime. When anthrax struck=
, the administration's first impulse was not to secure as much Cipro as spe=
edily as possible to protect Americans, but to protect the right of pharmac=
eutical companies to profiteer. The White House's faith in tax cuts as a pa=
nacea for all national ills has led to such absurdities as this week's Hous=
e ''stimulus'' package showering $254 million on Enron, the reeling Houston=
 energy company (now under S.E.C. investigation) that has served as a Bush =
campaign cash machine.=20
Airport security, which has been enhanced by at best cosmetic tweaks since =
Sept. 11, is also held hostage by campaign cash: As Salon has reported, Ser=
viceMaster, a supplier of the low-wage employees who ineptly man the gates,=
 is another G.O.P. donor. Not that Republicans stand alone in putting fat c=
ats first. In a display of bipartisanship, Democrats -- lobbied by Linda Ha=
ll Daschle, the Senate majority leader's wife -- joined the administration =
in handing the airlines a $15 billion bailout that enforces no reduction in=
 the salaries of the industry's C.E.O.'s even as they lay off tens of thous=
ands of their employees.=20
To see how the religious right has exerted its own distortions on homeland =
security, you also have to consider an administration pattern that goes bac=
k to its creation -- and one that explains the recent trials of poor Tom Ri=
dge.=20
Mr. Ridge is by all accounts a capable leader -- a successful governor of a=
 large state (Pennsylvania) who won the Bronze Star for heroism in Vietnam.=
 A close friend of George W. Bush, he should have been in the administratio=
n from the get-go, and was widely rumored to be a candidate for various job=
s, including the vice presidency. But after being pilloried by the right be=
cause he supports abortion rights, he got zilch. Instead of Mr. Ridge, the =
administration signed on the pro-life John Ashcroft and Tommy Thompson -- w=
ho have brought us where we are today.=20
The farcical failures of these two cabinet secretaries are not merely those=
 of public relations -- though Mr. Thompson often comes across as a Chamber=
 of Commerce glad-hander who doesn't know his pants are on fire, and Mr. As=
hcroft often shakes as if he's not just seen great Caesar's ghost but perha=
ps John Mitchell's as well. Both have a history of letting politics overrid=
e public policy that dates to the start of the administration. They've seen=
 no reason to reverse their partisan priorities even at a time when the pat=
riotic duty of effectively fighting terror should be their No. 1 concern.=
=20
Pre-Sept. 11, Mr. Thompson, in defiance of science, heartily lent his credi=
bility to the Bush administration's stem cell ''compromise'' by going along=
 with its overstatement of the viability and diversity of the stem cell lin=
es it would deliver to researchers. Post-Sept. 11, he destroyed his credibi=
lity by understating the severity of the anthrax threat, also in defiance o=
f science. Now he maintains that the $1.5 billion the administration is req=
uesting to plug the many holes in our public health system -- almost all of=
 it earmarked for stockpiling pharmaceuticals, not shoring up local hospita=
ls -- is adequate for fighting bioterrorism. This, too, is in defiance of a=
ll expert estimates, including that of the one physician in the Senate, the=
 Republican Bill Frist.=20
It should also be on Mr. Thompson's conscience that for the first two weeks=
 of the anthrax crisis he kept the federal government's house physician -- =
David Satcher, the surgeon general and a much-needed honest broker of publi=
c health -- locked away, presumably because Dr. Satcher, a Clinton appointe=
e, became persona non grata in the Bush administration for issuing a June r=
eport on teenage sexuality that angered the religious right. Only after Mr.=
 Ridge arrived on the scene was the surgeon general liberated from the gula=
g.=20
As for Mr. Ashcroft, he has gone so far as to turn away firsthand informati=
on about domestic terrorism for political reasons. Planned Parenthood, whic=
h has been on the front lines of anthrax scares for years and has by grim n=
ecessity marshaled the medical and security expertise to combat them, has s=
ought a meeting with the attorney general since he took office but has neve=
r been granted one. This was true not only before Sept. 11 but, says Ann Gl=
azier, Planned Parenthood's director of security, remains true -- even thou=
gh her organization, long targeted by such home-grown Talibans as the Army =
of God, has a decade's worth of leads on ''the convergence of international=
 and domestic terrorism.''=20
Ms. Glazier found the sight of Mr. Ashcroft and other federal Keystone Kops=
 offering a $1 million reward for anthrax terrorists a laughable indication=
 of how little grasp they have of the enemy. ''Religious extremists don't r=
espond to money,'' she points out. Such is the state of the F.B.I., she add=
s, that one agent told a clinic to hold onto a suspect letter for a couple =
of days ''because we have so many here we're afraid we're going to lose it'=
' (perhaps among the Timothy McVeigh documents).=20
If either the attorney general or the secretary of health and human service=
s inspired anything like the confidence that, say, Mayor Giuliani does, the=
re wouldn't have been a need to draft Mr. Ridge. Even so, he's mainly a P.R=
. gimmick -- a man who should have been in the administration in the first =
place reduced to serving as a fig leaf for lightweights. As director of hom=
eland security, he's allegedly charged with supervising nearly 50 governmen=
t agencies -- so far with roughly a dozen staff members. When asked to defi=
ne Mr. Ridge's responsibilities, Ari Fleischer said on Wednesday that it wa=
s ''a very busy coordination job,'' but so far Mr. Ridge is mainly sowing s=
till more confusion.=20
The one specific duty that he has claimed -- in an interview with Tom Broka=
w -- was that he'd be the one ''making the phone call'' to the president to=
 shoot down any commercial airliner turned into a flying bomb by hijackers.=
 That presumably comes as news to Donald Rumsfeld, who made no provision fo=
r any homeland security czar in the Air Force chain of command he publicly =
codified days after Mr. Ridge's appointment.=20
Since the administration tightly metes out the news from Afghanistan, we ca=
n only hope that the war there is being executed more effectively than the =
war here -- even as Mr. Rumsfeld and his generals now tell us that the Tali=
ban, once expected to implode in days, are proving Viet-Cong-like in their =
intractability. The Wall Street Journal also reported this week that ''inst=
ead of a thankful Afghan population, popular support for the Taliban appear=
s to be solidifying and anger with the U.S. growing.''=20
Maybe we're losing that battle for Afghan hearts and minds in part because =
the Bush State Department appointee in charge of the propaganda effort is a=
 C.E.O. (from Madison Avenue) chosen not for her expertise in policy or pol=
itics but for her salesmanship on behalf of domestic products like Head & S=
houlders shampoo. If we can't effectively fight anthrax, I guess it's reass=
uring to know we can always win the war on dandruff.

City - Enron directors cash in shares.
By Simon English.

LEADING executives at Enron, the troubled US energy giant, cashed in shares=
 worth more than $100m ( #70m) this year in the run-up to a financial crunc=
h that has left the company's credibility in ruins.=20
Research by Thomson Financial shows that Kenneth Lay, chief executive, sold=
 about 400,000 shares this year, netting him more than $25m. He still held =
2.8m shares until July.
Other executives made similar sales, a revelation likely to anger investors=
 who have seen the shares fall from $83 at the start of the year to $45 by =
July. They halved again this week and fell to below $16 yesterday. Enron de=
clined to comment on the share sales.=20
Mr Lay said in a statement that he is seeking to "dispel uncertainty in the=
 financial community" by drawing on lines of credit to restore faith in Enr=
on's financial strength. Enron will pay off debts of $2.2 billion and keep =
another $800,000 in cash. He said: "We know we have our work cut out for us=
 if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community."=20
The company is facing an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission in=
to partnerships managed by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer.=
=20
Mr Fastow was ousted on Wednesday night as part of the company's moves to r=
estore confidence, though Enron insists he has done nothing wrong.=20
Enron lost $1 billion in the third quarter on what it has called "failed in=
vestments".

INDIA: Lenders to meet over Enron's Dabhol on Nov 3.

10/27/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Lenders to power plant in India majority owned b=
y Enron Corp have called a meeting next week in London to discuss ways of r=
eviving the beleaguered project, a banking source said on Saturday.=20
They will examine offers that two Indian companies have put forward for buy=
ing the U.S. energy giant's 65 percent stake, and those of two other U.S. f=
irms, in Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which is building the controversial pr=
oject, the source told Reuters.
The meeting of lenders, who include multinational banks such as Citibank an=
d Bank of America , will be held on November 3, the source added.=20
At stake is not just the fate of the $2.9 billion, 2,184 MW project, which =
is India's largest foreign direct investment, but also the over $600 millio=
n investment of Enron, General Electric Co and Bechtel.=20
All three companies are founders of DPC, which in 1995 got permission from =
India's Maharashtra state government to set up the plant on its coast.=20
The plant's first phase of 740 MW was completed in 1999, but work on the se=
cond phase of 1,444 MW, which is 97 percent complete, was abruptly stopped =
in June this year following a blazing row with cash-strapped state utility =
MSEB.=20
MSEB, which agreed in 1995 to take the plant's entire output, said it can n=
o longer do so because Dabhol's power is too costly.=20
Dabhol, in turn, accused MSEB of defaulting on its monthly payments and ser=
ved a preliminary notice to terminate the power purchase contract.=20
Under this notice, both companies are given six months time to settle the m=
atter through negotiations. If talks fail, Dabhol has the right to issue a =
final termination notice and take the matter to arbitration in London. That=
 six month period expires on November 19.=20
Houston-based Enron, which owns 65 percent of Dabhol, further announced tha=
t it intends to exit the project and offered to sell its equity to the Indi=
an government.=20
TIME RUNNING OUT=20
The Business Standard newspaper reported that next week's meeting would als=
o discuss a request by Dabhol to finally terminate the contract after Novem=
ber 19.=20
"It is one of the items on the agenda," the paper quoted a senior banker as=
 saying.=20
The paper said once Dabhol serves the final notice, the matter proceeds to =
arbitration, which would not help India.=20
"The widespread view among the government and lenders is that in such a sit=
uation DPC will win hands down," the paper added.=20
A Dabhol spokesman could not be contacted immediately.=20
The source said the meeting would review the progress made in resolving the=
 dispute so far.=20
The Indian government has not responded to Enron's offer to buy its equity,=
 but two Indian companies, BSES Ltd and Tata Power Ltd , have shown interes=
t.=20
They have agreed to take over the project if the cost is reduced, and if th=
e founders agree to sell their stake at a discount.=20
Local business daily, the Economic Times reported on Friday that Tata Power=
 and BSES are willing to pay the founders $450-$600 million for the 85 perc=
ent stake held by Enron, GE and Bechtel.=20
Enron has rejected the offer and is not ready to settle for anything less t=
han $1 billion, the paper added.=20
Officials of Tata Power and BSES were not immediately available for comment=

HOUSTON -- Enron has sued Microsoft, alleging it breached a contract for br=
oadband services, in a move that could temporarily block the largest softwa=
re company's MSN high-speed Internet service in some U.S. regions.=20
Microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company from providing th=
e high-speed service in areas where Enron provides broadband access, leavin=
g MSN fully operational only in the 14 states -- including Washington -- wh=
ere Qwest Communications International operates, said Bob Visse, director o=
f marketing for MSN.
Enron's lawsuit was filed Thursday, the same day Microsoft had planned to o=
ffer fast Internet access in 45 cities to give it access to potential custo=
mers in 29 million homes. Microsoft, the No. 2 U.S. Internet provider, is m=
aking a push to win customers from AOL Time Warner.=20
"We are trying to resolve the issues with Enron, as quickly as possible and=
 at the same time we are evaluating other providers," Visse said.=20
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing co=
mpany policy on pending litigation. Enron, based in Houston, is the largest=
 energy trader.=20
Enron in June signed an agreement with Microsoft to provide bandwidth for M=
SN Internet service. Under the agreement, Enron isn't required to deliver o=
perational broadband services if Microsoft hasn't first provided a billing =
and ordering system, Dow Jones news wire reported.=20

Question for NetCo employees:
The new corp id's xfer to UBS is being considered for this Sunday.  Hence, no start menu access to estate.  You will still have access to NT estate drive data to copy.
Does anyone have the need to retain a estate id for support estate application during the last week?  Exceptions have to be authorized.
Wanted to get a preliminary need analysis...
 
This was sent by an IT manager, let me know your thoughts... O

We would like to change the Netco directory name to UBS.

We will have to change the links to the NGP&L and anything else that links to files in Netco.  Let me know this morning if that will be a major problem for anyone.

Thanks

Plove,

You once asked me to let you know when the next Special Olympics event I would be involved in would be. It will be the basketball tourney Feb. 23 and 24 in CyFair ISD school gyms. The day usually start at 9:00 and end at 3:00 or 4:00. (volunteers do not have to stay the whole day) Let me know if you and your wife are interested. Thanks.

Bill Gates' speech, love him or hate him, comes pretty close to hitting the

with kids of any age, or anyone who has ever been a kid, here's some advice
Bill Gates recently dished out at a high school speech about 11 things they
did not learn in school.  He talks about how feel-good politically correct
teachings created a full generation of kids with no concept of reality and
how this concept set them up for failure in the real world.  Here's what he
said:

Rule 1: Life is not fair--get used to it.

Rule 2: The world won't care about your self-esteem.  The world will expect
you to accomplish something BEFORE you feel good about yourself.

Rule 3: You will NOT make 40 thousand dollars a year right out of high
school.  You won't be a vice-president with a car phone, until you earn
both.

Rule 4: If you think your teacher is tough, wait till you get a boss.  He
doesn't have tenure.

Rule 5: Flipping burgers is not beneath your dignity.  Your grandparents had
a different word for burger flipping--they called it opportunity.

Rule 6: If you mess up, it's not your parents' fault, so don't whine about
your mistakes, learn from them.

Rule 7: Before you were born, your parents weren't as boring as they are
now.  They got that way from paying your bills; cleaning your clothes and
listening to you talk about how cool you are.  So before you save the rain
forest from the parasites of your parents' generation, try delousing the
closet in your own room.

Rule 8: Your school may have done away with winners and losers but life has
not.  In some schools they have abolished failing grades and they'll give
you as many times, as you want to get the right answer. This doesn't bear
the slightest resemblance to ANYTHING in real life.

Rule 9: Life is not divided into semesters.  You don't get summers off and
very few employers are interested in helping you find yourself.  You have to
do that on your own time.

Rule 10: Television is NOT real life.  In real life people actually have to
leave the coffee shop and go to jobs.

Rule 11: Be nice to nerds.  Chances are you'll end up working for one.

Subject: FW: Policy on migration of data to Netco






The following guidelines should be followed in determining the kind of application data and databases that should be migrated to UBS.

1. As a general rule, all Enron data relating to or used in connection with the trading of North American Gas and Power (Netco's commodities) should be copied and the copy transferred to Netco.  This includes forward curves created in the past and data on commodities that are relevant to the pricing of Netco's commodities (i.e., coal and oil).  Data on other commodities should not be copied or transferred for Netco.  In all cases, a complete copy of the data transferred to Netco must be retained by Enron.

2. There are three important exceptions to the general rule:

a. With respect to trading counterparties, only contact information and Enron created trading profiles may be transferred to Netco.  All other information concerning a trading counterparty, including credit information, historical trading data and terms of trading contracts with Enron, may not be transferred without the express written consent of the trading counterparty and the approval of the legal department.

b. With respect to other third parties that have entered into written agreements with Enron, such as brokers, software vendors and market data vendors, only contact information may be transferred to Netco.  All other information, including pricing, concerning the contractual relationship between Enron and the third party may not be transferred without the approval of the legal department.  In many cases there are confidentiality provisions in these agreements requiring the consent of the third party prior to the disclosure of confidential information.

c. Historical data provided to Enron by a third party data source may not be transferred to Netco without the approval of the legal department.  In many cases, the contracts governing the data preclude its copying and transfer.

If you have any questions concerning these guidelines, please contact Regan Smith at x39291.

Hi Philiip,

Hey.  My friend Chad (i think you remember him) just moved back here from Houston and is currently in job search mode.  He is in the same field as you..and worked for Raymond James in Houston.  He has some pretty good leads here..and some may pan out for more than just him.  Once he has things settled...meaning when he has a job he will be helpful to you.  Once I know more I will let you know.

Phillip - sorry for such a late response but I have been on vacation.  I looked up the books mentioned below and the INTRA-CENTRAL-PHY book is active.  I do not see the INTRA-EAST-PHY book in risktrac.  Please let me know if I need to create additional books.

Thanks,
Susan

Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

This is what has been suggested for future brown bags:

		
How hedges work (physical deals)/Why we book term deals in two systems
Curve mappings
How physical deals flow through our systems
What the financial desk does
	(EFP posting, Brokered deals, etc.)
Curves, how they are set, how deals value against them (MTM)
Overview of Power/Weather/Coal      (I vote for Phillip for this one)

I think we should also put the position report file in there that Jad/Couch created as a backup to the CEPos/East Positions.  Couch can you put the query file you set up for the price desk?

Jay,

I just checked my Sitara Reports access, and I was able to login and run a report, however there are still only Enron business units there, so nothing came up on the report.  I don't think the systems are synchronized yet.

Let me know if there's some other way to log in to access the UBSW testing contract/deals.

Thanks,
Susan

The current schedule is :
    
    Oct : Kam  (I forgot what topic you were going to do)
    Nov :  John - a revisit of OA (this time with a working overhead)
    Dec :  skip - I suggest we skip Dec since there will be quite a few vacations taken, holidays, etc.
    
    For the other topics, why don't you decide among yourselves, who is going to do what and when.  Please just let me know so that I can be sure we have things scheduled for Jan going forward.
 
Let me know if you have questions.
 
Greg

 could you send an updated financial termination list(if this list has chan=

Dawn has given us until noon Wednesday to get them the final list of EOL products and book mappings.  I know with the trader changes last Friday these will change again.  
The traders had a meeting this morning going over their curves, and it sounds like they are moving some curves between regions and might possibly be losing some locations.  Since we will be testing everything on Thursday, we need to have our curve files ready to load on Wednesday to give a prior day curve for portcalc.  
The west traders are looking at theirs now, can you guys check with your traders and see if they need any changes made to the files, and let them change any links?

We also need to create a curve file that the traders can get to, but doesn't give them access to any of our other files, so the current location will not be the final.  We can create this tomorrow once we have converted over to UBS.

Thanks

KK

1. move to the appropriate book based on the logic - Canadian deal needs to go to CAD
2. should only have to change deals from NG-Price to bankruptcy (deals are not in any other book)
3. The Canadian logic deals will probably be in GJ and the US logic should be in NG
4. Financial only
5. Cutoff date 1/1/2002

These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:

1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (166764) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?
4. Financial deals only
5. Cutoff date 1-jan-2002

Those two counterparties could be currently  in NG-Price, ENA-WT-Socal, or ENA-WT-Cal, not just NG-Price.

Linked to this e-mail is a spreadsheet that breaks down weekly pool winnings and the playoffs.  Let me know if I have screwed something up.

There is a P&L Summary for east desk in the Netco directory located at O:/ERMS/erms_adm/Netco/2002/0102/Regions0102/_Converted/East P&L Summ. Please take a look at it and tell me what you think. To simplify and speed up the reporting process, I added buttons that will link to the P&L's. The format may or may not resemble formats used on other desks, but I do believe the data shown is comprehensive.

Errol - This may not fit your needs on the financial desk. You may need to design your own. If so, let me know if I can help. 


Thanks.

Scott

Can you do the same thing with a different book id?  Instead of book counterparty FT-CAND-TERMIN, move any deals with the FT-TERMIN-GD book to the bankruptcy book from NG-Price.  Financial deals only.  Thanks.  Let me know if you need any further clarification, should be the exact same script as yesterday, just substitute FT_TERMIN-GD for the two books you were looking for yesterday.

1. move to the appropriate book based on the logic - Canadian deal needs to go to CAD
2. should only have to change deals from NG-Price to bankruptcy (deals are not in any other book)
3. The Canadian logic deals will probably be in GJ and the US logic should be in NG
4. Financial only
5. Cutoff date 1/1/2002

These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:

1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (166764) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?
4. Financial deals only
5. Cutoff date 1-jan-2002

We are going to try to get to the point of uploading our nomination into pegasys this month so we are changing the meters to correctly reflect what Sitara has vs what PGLC has.   

The trade zone TTP is available now and I am going forward and moving November deals into the new trade zone.  I am making a list of all the deals I am changing if anyone needs it.  



THESE ARE THE CORRECT METERS TO BE USED EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 1, 2001

PGLC/TTP/TTP - All buys and sales that are not being nominated from a contract - ALL "CHICAGO PEOPLES" EOL DEALS ARE MAPPED TO THIS METER

PGLC/NGPL/NGPL - All buys that are to be nominated specifically from an NGPL Transport  Contract

PGLC/NBPL/NBPL01 - All buys that are to be nominated specifically from an NBPL Transport Contract

PGLC/ANR/ANR -All buys that are to be nominated specifically from an ANR Transport Contract

PGLC/MIDW/MIDW -All buys that are to be nominated specifically from an Midwestern Transport Contract

PGLC/TRKL/TRNK - All buys that are to be nominated specifically from an Trunkline Transport Contract

PGLC/Alliance/ALNC - All buys that are to be nominated specifically from an Alliance Transport Contract Contract

PGLC/NGPL/MALV - ALL HUB DEALS

PGLC/NIG/NICOR - All deals at Skokie

PGLC/NGPL/PGL - - this meter is used for end users and city gate deliveries for PGLC, such as RFG

PGLC/NGPL/NSG - this meter is used for end users and city gate deliveries for Northshore Gas such as RFG

DO NOT USE THESE METERS AFTER OCTOBER 31, 2001

PGLC/NGPL/HUB
PGLC/NGPL/909285
PGLC/NBPL/103
PGLC/NBPL/81
PGLC/MGT/027062

Please take notice of the red cells.  These Tagg numbers were incorrect and I have changed the cells to the correct Tagg deal number.  All of the deals on this list have been moved to the bankrupcy book.

These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:

1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (166764) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?
4. Financial deals only
5. Cutoff date 1-jan-2002

Those two counterparties could be currently  in NG-Price, ENA-WT-Socal, or ENA-WT-Cal, not just NG-Price.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

This is  a new day and time for this meeting.  Thank you and I apologize for any inconvenience.

Background:  A request was received by the Gas Tactical group that would have implications on the system you use.  The request was to have the existing warning window appear if the trader enters a date that is before the date of the trade.  Knowing that there are times where trades can be back dated we cannot restrict this but to have the trader see a warning window appear to make them double check their dates (if they are for a previous date) would be beneficial to the requestor.  If they know the date is correct they would have the option to continue with the terms.

Often times, due to human error, Book Admins see mistakes made where the trade date is 10/15/01 and the terms are 10/01/01 to 10/31/01.  Because we are in the middle of the month a red flag is being raised with the Book Admins to question this trade.  Often times it is found that it was a mistake.  To date the system will only show a warning window if the trade terms were for 9/01/01 to 9/30/01.

Request Review:  Is it possible to allow the existing warning window to display for a date that is before the trade date (even a day before) and not just for a different month?

Thank you in advance.

Monica Clay

Subject: Monday 01/28 - Status report of integration testing, remaining, ou=
tstanding issues, going forward


Everyone - updates from testing last week, and communication of information=
/ going forward.
=20
Thanks to all involved in last weeks testing.  Much has been accomplished. =
 We did encounter a legal mandated 'test freeze' on Friday given a legal co=
mmunication came down to halt all data entry/ code changes, but as of Frida=
y evening, it was eventually lifted.  Any unfinished testing can continue.
=20
We've completed:
- Integration testing of 25 transaction type scenarios - from EOL entry, Si=
tara, TDS, Tagg.  This includes the sample testing of scripts, and the end =
to end testing to SAP.
- EOL has sent 13 gas and 4 financial transactions through downstream syste=
ms.
- Over 50 integration issues identified and resolved!  Majority were data s=
etup issues, but code changes were identified, incorrect hardware being use=
d, reports not running, start-up scripting issues resolved, replication iss=
ues resolved.
=20
What's remaining to test and status:
1) EDI testing - Tammy Jaquet, Robert Virnau are expected to complete the E=
DI test by end of day today (01/28)
2) Financial Settlements/ EOL deals - Mechelle Stevens is completing her ve=
rification of EOL deals into Unify.  Testing is expected to complete the ED=
I test by end of day today (01/28).
3) SAP testing - SAP is still in requirements analysis with regards to GL a=
ccount setup, profit centers.  A meeting is scheduled for Wednesday afterno=
on with the UBS, SAP, Netco leads.  SAP testing can be conducted between Un=
ify and within SAP once decisions are determined.
=20
Any other issues we are not aware of, please advise.
=20
Outstanding known issues:
1) Unify custom reports (SQR) not working.  This was not part of integratio=
n test, but testing by Kelley Huntley on Friday resulted in failure.  Infra=
structure expected to resolve by Monday noon.
2) There is some data setup that is being completed Monday morning and shou=
ld be complete by now.
=20
Any other issues we are not aware of, please advise.
=20
Going forward:
1) The Netco EOL (or new OLT?) team will be testing all week deals into Net=
co environments.  You may see these in downstream systems.
2) Analysis of what estate data still resides in Netco, and what needs to b=
e there to go forward.  Namely curve data for EnPower.
3) We will perform regression testing to determine if there are any cross d=
ependency of hardware.  Testing scenarios include:
    a) Application messaging that use Tibco (port, multi-cast addresses)
    b) Estate execution with Netco hardware inactive
    c) Netco execution with Estate hardware inactive
=20
Notice/ FYI - All Netco (UBS) employee's LAN NT user-id's will be changed t=
o a new file server (anticipated Friday 02/01). =20
The impacts are mainly the O:\ drive, W:\ drive will be split between Estat=
e and Netco.  All authorized (legal) data is being copied now to the new fi=
le servers.
For example, if Netco employees need specific files on the O:\ drive, if th=
ey are missing, they would have remained with estate.  If you have files in=
 progress, they
may missing the batch file copy which is occurring this week.
=20
Updates to follow later this week!

=20
In today's test, we had numerous data setup related issues  that resulted i=
n downtime (ie EOL- Dynegy information, TGP address information, bad credit=
 counterparty/ contracts,  or database issues with data sync/ replication).=
   These were mainly attributed to the massive cleanup/ removal of data not=
 needed.  The  remaining issues open are being addressed Wednesday night. =
=20
=20
Given the deferred 12:00pm to 2:00pm start time and data setup/ sync issues=

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

We are beginning the development stage of our Consolidated Gas System - Reporting project and we need to get more detailed information about the location of data that is being pulled in WeaponX presently.  The majority of the reports we have been able to locate in ERMS but there are a couple where the data has not been found.  We need to map the present location of the data to ensure all information will be in the new system.  We would also like to go through a calc (step-by-step) to ensure all necessary pieces will be included in the new system.

We are requesting one representative from Risk Management be present to answer a few questions.  A data architect and a developer will be present to ask necessary questions to get off to a good start.  Please let me know who will be available from the Risk side.

Thank you.
