No need to do a risk memo if the legal risk rating would be a 1.  Is that 
what this one would be?  Mark

I propose that we continue to alternate the Office of General Counsel ("OGC") 
and Legal Committee ("LC") meetings of Enron Wholesale Services on Monday 
mornings at 8:30 am, Houston time.  The OGC and the LC would have the 
following members:
       
  OGC     LC
 Alan Aronowitz     OGC
 Mark Evans     Justin Boyd
 Barbara Gray     Michelle Cash
 Jeff Hodge     Steven Douglas
 Bruce Lundstrom    Peter Keohane
 Travis McCullough    John Novak
 Julia Murray     [Marcus Von Bock und Polach?]
 Elizabeth Sager     Dan Rogers
 Richard Sanders    Paul Simons
 Lance Schuler
 Mark Taylor
 Sheila Tweed
 Randy Young
 
Please give me your comments.  It is anticipated that we will continue to 
adjust the membership of both groups as the businesses continue to change.  I 
plan to address the policy committee in February.

Here are my thoughts so far:

1.  Initial Legal Team -- Jeff Hodge, Jim Keller, Carol St. Clair, Aaron 
Rothwarg

2.  Spot Check the Forms -- over the next week

3.  Conform Forms to ENA Forms -- over next two months

4.  Develop Form Approval Process -- dual approvals by EES and ENA

5.  Develop Deal Approval Process -- deals above a certain size (or material 
variations from the form) would require concurrent EWS approval

6.  Request List of Major Contract Concerns from Traders -- items that cannot 
be hedged

Mark, on reflection, I think that there is currently only one legal risk 
within Enron Canada that would warrant being added to the top legal risks for 
ENA, which is the Alberta Sundance "B" PPA acquired in the Alberta PPA 
auction in August, 2000.

I would suggest the description attached.

Cynthia, Rick Grove and I talked by phone to Chairman Rainer today about 
energy.  I made the point that energy swaps should be treated just like 
financial commodity swaps.  Also, I pointed out that innovation has been 
slowed for electronic trading of energy by the current regulatory structure.  
I think it would be a good idea to prepare a "positive" letter from a few 
congressman encouraging a point of view on energy more like the Senate bill.

  Pete Van De Gohm of EES has again raised the topic of inventorying our 
trade secret protection which has been discussed from time to time.  I have 
visited with Jim Derrick about having a legal/business committee representing 
your major groups.  It would function in a similar manner as our Y2K 
committee did.  We would have Fulbright & Jaworski give our people general 
instructions, our business people would canvass our companies to determine 
what we considered proprietary trade secrets and if we were not protecting 
our proprietary information appropriately, we could address that issue.  
Fulbright could also be used on an ad hoc basis.   Costs would be shared 
proportionately between the major groups except special fees attributable to 
a specific operating group.
 
  I believe we need this inventory.  If we try to enforce our non-competition 
agreements and we can't prove that we kept such information on a need to know 
basis and properly secured, we could lose the law suit.  

  Jim asked that I contact each of you regarding this to see if you were in 
agreement with the proposed plan.  Please respond as soon as possible if you 
agree so we can get the project off the ground.

Mark,
 
Attached are a few questions that you might like to have asked and have a 
prepared answer for, to assist in your Floor Meeting.
 
As a suggestion you might want to allocate these questions, or any others to 
be asked to your direct reports at your regular meeting on Monday and where 
necessary they can provide you with any particular details to give as full an 
answer as you would like. Janette could possibly ask question numbered 1.
 
Let me know if there is anything you would like me to do. I will of course be 
happy to ask any question, provided you have had the opportunity to prepare 
an answer.
 
Regards,
 
Marcus


1.When will EWS Legal Department be moving to the new building and where will 
we be located? 

2.Will all attorneys have an office?

3.While we expect all areas of the EWS business to grow, which areas , over 
the next 6-12 months, do you believe will grow the fastest and require the 
greatest support from the EWS Legal Department?

4.With the bankruptcy of PG&E what were we able to do using our existing 
contracts to mitigate our exposure?

5.Are there any changes that you believe we will need to make to our 
contracts or any new contracts we will need to consider entering into with 
counterparties to assist us in managing our risk in the event of future 
bankruptcies?
 
6. Are you able to tell us what we estimate financial our exposure is to PG&E 
as a result of their bankruptcy?

7.Why is Enron winding down its power trading operations in Japan?

It was good to see you also.  I am only available on the 14th.  I would like 
you to come to Enron and talk about the audit and certain key provisions in 
the trading agreements with the top trading lawyers.  Give Mark Taylor a call

Mark, it was good to see you Thursday.  My next visit to Houston is
scheduled for May 14 and 15.  I will be making a presentation concerning the
legal consequences of market abuse in electricity trading to a Risk Magazine
Conference on the 14th.  As we discussed last week, I would, if you wish, be
pleased to speak to your colleagues on the same subject during my visit.  I
would also be pleased to discuss the contract audit issues, focusing on the
key provisions that have been, or we expect to be, critical from a financial
or reputational perspective.  In that regard, it would be helpful to discuss
Enron' experience with agreements/provisions before finalizing my remarks.
Perhaps you could identify someone on your staff with whom I may speak.

Best regards.

Mark -

I was reviewing information Leslie had left behind and was curious if you 
ever had a chance to review and approve the Third Party Platform Policy that 
Leslie had prepared?  If not, I have attached a version of the policy below 
for your review.

The only change I see that needs to be made is the replacement of Leslie's 
name with mine.

Please let me know if you should need anything further.

Yes, Michael raised it to me, so that is all clear.  With respect to the 
candidate you mentioned, I think I would need to review his resume and see 
what the arguments would be.  Let's get together and talk about this before

Do you think that a bill favorable to energy will be passed over the strong 
opposition of the CFTC?  What kind of odds do you put on it?  It is a 
significant change if Treasury is not longer against us -- but it is a little 
hard for me to believe that it is real.  Should I try to make a trip to

Please send the following message to all of Enron Canada (Calgary/Toronto).  
By copy, I will let John or Mark decide if anything needs to be circulated in 
Houston/Portland.

"The Alberta Power Purchase Auction closed this morning, but is not final 
until the Alberta has decided to accept all bids and declare the Winning 
Bidders.  Nonetheless, various media outlets have and will be calling to 
inquire if Enron bid or was successful in bidding on any of the Plants or 
Units.  I want to again confirm that under the Auction Participation 
Agreements and Auction Rules we cannot discuss this matter with any third 
parties including the media unless and until Alberta has declared the Winning 
Bidders, and this obligation is secured by a significant Letter of Credit and 
Guarantee of Enron Corp.  Accordingly, all such inquiries are to be referred 
to Rob Milnthorp, Derek Davies or Peter Keohane for their handling."

Mark and Peter - Attached is a copy of the speech made today by the Ontario 
Minister of Energy.  Of course we would have been much happier with an 
outside date or target of November 1, 2001 or  an unconditional May 1, 2002 
date; however, it at least shows a commitment to deregulation. 

While Enron Toronto will be busy with ongoing marketing and certain major 
projects in the near future (the OEFC NUG Contract Management Agreement, the 
G6 retail initiative and the ENERconnect amendment),  the obvious umber one 
priority of this office in the short term will be negotiating an extension to 
the British Energy Supply Contract.

Mr. Speaker: 
This Legislature passed the Energy Competition Act in 1998 to help meet the 
province's long-term electricity needs and ensure that Ontarians have a safe, 
reliable and affordable supply of power.
When this government came to office in 1995, we had our work cut out for us. 
Ontario's electricity sector was failing us.
Consumers and businesses had no choice of who supplied them with power. And 
we went from having one of the lowest prices for electricity to the third 
highest in Canada. 
The monopoly we had come to rely on for safe, reliable and 
competitively-priced electricity was no longer working. It had become out of 
date, inefficient and too expensive. Something had to be done.
That's why I'm proud to stand up in the Legislature today to announce that:
The government is confident that conditions necessary to open the electricity 
market to competition will exist by May 2002. The government is committed to 
an open market while guaranteeing a safe, affordable and reliable supply.
There are some who are fundamentally opposed to opening this market to 
competition. Our government believes, however, that open, competitive markets 
are beneficial. They keep costs low, encourage innovation and benefit 
consumers. 
There are others who share our desire to open the market, but who would like 
to see it done even sooner. As government, we bear a responsibility to ensure 
the opening is done right for all involved. To do this, we are committed to 
opening the market at the earliest possible date, while ensuring all of the 
conditions required for a smooth transition to competition are met.
And I'm pleased to tell you, Mr. Speaker, that the four principles guiding 
the government's vision have been, or will be met, by May 2002.

First and foremost, protecting consumers and offering more choice. The 
overall market design and regulatory framework for introducing competition 
puts customers first. Over the long term, a competitive market will lead to 
the lowest possible costs and better service for all. 
Second, creating a strong business climate with a reliable supply of 
electricity. Ontario already has sufficient supply to meet our current needs. 
Announcing a firm market opening deadline today provides greater certainty to 
potential new investors who have already announced 3 billion dollars in new 
generation projects. 
Thirdly, we will protect our environment. My colleague, the Minister of the 
Environment has announced tough new emission caps for the electricity sector. 
They will be among the toughest in North America, matching the requirements 
of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Also today, Minister Witmer is announcing changes to ensure that new 
electricity projects are reviewed in a clear and consistent manner under the 
province's environmental assessment process.
And fourth, we will encourage new ways of doing business and support the 
search for alternative sources of power. For the first time, customers will 
be able to make clean air a priority by choosing the type of power they want, 
including wind, fuel cells and solar. Giving them choice will help promote 
the demand for cleaner, greener electricity. 
And so, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to announce that Ontario's electricity sector 
will open by May 2002. The government is keeping its promise to introduce a 
competitive electricity market. We will do it, and we have put the principles 
in place to ensure that we do it right.

Thank you.

Dear Mark,
I hope you are doing well.  You may be getting a call from JoAnne Pinkett
regarding a proposal for future funding of the BEAR program.  There has
apparently been some difficulty in communication between the BEAR board and
our board.  

Any proposal has to make its way through the Children's Services Committee
then the Executive Committee.  It is then put before the whole board for a
vote.  I thought that you would be an idea person to advise the BEAR
representatives as to how to structure the proposal to the Children's
Committee to ensure that it is given a fair and expeditious review and
decision - a proposal that would be comprehensible to board members who are
not directly involved with the BEAR program.  I also thought you could give
this advice without having to commit a great deal of time (including travel
time for meetings).

I think everyone agrees that it is a great program and that we should be
supportive of such public-private partnerships.  There is probably some
difference of opinion amongst the board as to how much support (and at what
pace) we should give the program.  I would deeply appreciate your helping
the BEAR folks make the clearest proposal possible.  I, for one, want this
program to succeed.  As good as its current work is - I think it holds even
greater potential for benefiting the children we serve.
Thanks for your help,
Ernest

I would not want to move forward with either unless you are a "sponsor" and 
believe such tools would clearly add value immediately.   Mark

		 Subject: eLaw and eVelocity

Rob/Mark -

I wanted to give you both a brief overview of the reviews this past week of 
eLaw and eVelocity.

eLaw - I met with principals of eLaw and Steve Horn earlier this week.  The 
reason for the meeting was really a pitch of second round funding from Enron 
to the tune of $10MM to $15MM.  The secondary focus was on the product and 
its usefulness to Enron. Steve made it clear that any funding decision would 
be driven 100% by a decision by the Legal Department to use the tool and, 
thus, it was up to Legal to review it and see where to go.

The demonstration of the tool was impressive.  Though it does act as a 
traditional shopping type site in many respects, it also has functionality to 
create a "myelaw" page customized to the information you, the user are the 
most interested in seeing.  It also allows for a query into further 
information, which query is then forwarded to the law firms (or firm) 
supporting the practice area (e.g. Labor/Employment) for comment.  There is 
also the ability to set up an Enron library so that information on topics 
developed by Enron retained firms can be loaded, organized and maintained, 
including legal opinions, memoranda on various topics and form 
pleadings/documents.  This area is secure from the balance of the site so 
that other users cannot access the information.  The loading process is 
fairly easy and could easily be implemented within a firm environment.  Some 
of the functionality that would be the most useful is due to be released in a 
new version coming out early Q1 and by the end of 2001 there is the plan to 
have at least 10 or so practice areas available.  Right now the focus is on 
Environmental, Intellectual Property, Health Care, and Tax.

I think the tool could be useful, especially in relation to the organization 
of information we obtain from our outside sources.  It may also complement 
the website/portal concept we are currently looking to make a part of the 
website/portal development process.  I would be curious to see, however, what 
other tools are out there doing the same or similar function.


eVelocity - I met this afternoon with Mike Griffs (sp?) to discuss the 
eVelocity tool.  It was presented as a portal concept to link the law firm 
and our legal department solely for the movement, review and payment of law 
firm invoices.  While it is billed as a system capable of interfacing with a 
matter management system, it can, itself, be used as a matter management tool.

The capabilities of the system revolve around the determination of a set of 
rules that are applicable to law firm invoices.  For example, say Enron does 
not pay more than $0.10 per page of copying.  This can be set as a rule so 
that any invoice loaded into eVelocity by a law firm containing more than 
this amount per page would be automatically rejected.  The rejection would 
then require the law firm to adjust the bill accordingly and resubmit it to 
the system.  This same functionality can be put in place on the Enron side so 
that the rule requires the bill to come into Enron for review, but notes that 
it is not compliant with the established rules so that the reviewing attorney 
is alerted to the issue.  The system does identify the problem so you do not 
have to search the entire invoice to see what differs from the rules.  It is 
possible to  establish rules that would allow an invoice, presuming it 
complied with all rules, to be automatically approved and moved to AP for 
payment.   This would require interfacing with AP and the SAP system, but it 
could be done.

In addition to the above functionality, the system can also track matters, 
budgets for matters, costs incurred for a matter and the name of the law firm 
people who are authorized to bill against a specific matter.  Reports can be 
generated in an number of formats to assess financial performance against a 
budget or overall costs for various matters.  Finally, since it is a 
web/browser based system, implementation is not difficult and there is not a 
lot of IT involvement needed.

I specifically asked why any other matter management system would be needed 
and received the response that there really is no such need.  Mike indicated 
a pilot program would take no more than two to three weeks to set up.

In keeping with the ideas surrounding the technology plan developed for EWS, 
as well as similar ideas presented for the Corp. portal/website, it makes 
sense to look at implementing a matter management system of some sort that 
goes beyond litigation tracking.  Whether or not it is eVelocity or another 
comparable tool would require further research into the available products, 
but I believe it would be worth while to pursue maybe in a pilot program 
atmosphere.

What I have provided above is a general overview of the products and meetings 
surrounding the demonstrations.  If either of you would like further 
information or have any questions, please let me know.

Dave:

Based on our discussions this morning:

1.  Internal Costs -- a capacity charge will be determined for each wholesale 
business unit based on a time allocation matrix that each lawyer and 
paralegal prepares.  The time allocation matrix will be revised  during the 
year if material changes in the work occur.

2.  Outside Costs -- require internal sign-off by GC and COO to spend more 
than $10,000 on a potential transaction AND a written transaction budget for 
proposed outside legal expenses more than $10,000.  Wherever possible, a firm 
cap on legal fees should be negotiated.  A memorandum will be sent from the 
GC and [Chairman of the Wholesale Group?] laying out the procedure to all 
employees.  

3.  Selection of Outside Lawyers -- expressly add billing rates and 
efficiency as key considerations, in addition to quality, in the selection of 
outside counsel.  [Dave, we need to complete our discussion on this point.]  
Our new policy needs to be reviewed with outside counsel.

4.  Reopener!  -- need to review where business changes significantly.

The intent is that the higher the rating, the higher the legal risk.  I 
believe the jurisdictional risk is a key factor in creating legal issues even 
if none exist at the time the deal is done.  Does that make sense?  Stuart 
should be on the LC.  Randy is the GC of South America.

		 Subject: Risk Memos and Legal Committee

As for the email on Risk Memos:  I thought it looked good and is very 
appropriate.  I did note that there were 4 categories for low risk 
jurisdictions, and only 3 categories for each of medium and high risk 
jurisdictions.  Maybe we cannot have a "no legal" risk in a high risk 
jurisdiction; but what about "many significant" legal issues in a medium risk 
jurisdiction?  Is this then too many categories?   Also, would it make any 
sense to have ratings of 1 through 4 only, with a requirement to specify 
whether we are dealing with a low, medium or high risk jurisdiction?  In 
other words, could anyone be confused into believing that  a rating of 4 is 
better than a rating of a 5?  As currently set forth, a higher rating does 
not necessarily equate to a greater risk.  Unless a reader were very familiar 
with the rating scale, someone might interpret a low number, out of say 10, 
as having minimal risk, when ratings 4, 7 and 10 may actually be the "worst".

As for the OGC and Legal Committee:  I note only that Dan and Lisa would no 
longer be on the LC.  How do you think we would convey this to them?  Also, I 
was understanding that Stuart would start to be included.  I have also been 
asked recently where Randy Young technically fits within the system.  He is 
on the OGC, but I am still confused where he is technically on some 
organization chart.  

Thanks.  Lance.

Mark:

Happy new year. I hope your new year was eventful on the personal side and
uneventful on the business side.

As you will have seen from my e-mail earlier this week, we are very close to
final on the Supplement. We just have a couple of firms to hear from and we
are chasing them down. One of those is Enron, which you recall took on the
responsibility for the various commodities that no one else volunteered for
(benzene & methanol). Can you check up on the status of the review?

Thanks.

According to our records all of you have some sort of high speed internet 
access to your home.  Either Cable Modem or DSL service.  When most of these 
lines where installed, we did not have a standard on how to connect back to 
the Enron network.  Most if not all of you are using the Client software on 
your PC's.  In order to provide more security to both Enron and Your PC.  We 
need to configure and deploy a Nortel Instant Internet Box.   the way the 
Nortel box works is what they call splitt tunnelling.  If it sees traffic 
that needs to go to enron it will go through the tunnel, other wise it goes 
directly to the internet.


We will need to know the following information to configure and deploy the 
Router
1. UserName and Login if required by the ISP.
2. If you have static IP addresses, We need to know that as well.
3. Co/RC to charge for the Nortel Box (Approx $500.00)


If you no longer have DSL or Cable service or You do not have either please 
let us know.  Other wise Please return the above information back to Enron 
network security.

Thanks

Mark -- We need to update FERC's records for our wholesale power marketers 
(EPMI and our plants) to list an official to receive service of certain FERC 
documents.  I believe that you are general counsel for all of these and would 
like to list you.  If something comes from FERC (which should not happen 
often), you would just forward it to me.  I need to send this information to 
FERC next week.  Is this fine with you?  

Thanks.  Christi

Louise:

Is Enron ready for this?  I think it is a good suggestion for the most 
significant deals.  It is really positive in that it would force dealmakers 
to pay more attention to what the contracts provide.  I am not sure it makes 
sense to follow this procedure for every deal that is dashed.  Let's talk 
about what are the objectives.  Great question! 

Mark

Subject: CACs Forms

We have spoken about this before, the issue is that Enron Americas has no 
approval mechanism for contracts. Neither does any other group but that is 
not my problem.  I have spent too much time reading DASH forms which really 
do not provide full authorization.

There are two suggestions that I would like to be implemented:

(i) DASH forms need to include all of the contracts which are to be signed 
under the deal.  So if a DASH is signed then this authorizes all of the 
contracts to be signed in the deal.  Any contracts which are not included 
need to go through the process outlined below.

(ii) All contracts need a Contract Approval Form attached and Enron's legal 
team cannot initial any contract until this form has been completed (ie 
signed) by the following Enron staff.

Trader/Originator ________________________________
Head of Group (VP or above)______________________
Credit__________________________________________
Legal__________________________________________
Tech Services (where applicable)__________________
Commercial Support (where applicable)_____________

A database of all completed contracts on behalf of Enron Americas needs to be 
maintained by Legal.

Thoughts please?

Mark, I am trying to find a good commercial firm in or around West Palm 
Beach, Florida that I can use as local counsel, if necessary, on a go-forward 
basis with our Advanced Mobile Power Systems transaction.  As you are likely 
aware, Enron has agreed to provide legal services to AMPS for the next six 
months, and I wanted to have available, if possible, a firm in Florida with 
which Enron is familiar and whom Enron has used before for any situations 
that require specific legal advice relating to the laws of Florida.  I am 
going to Florida to run through the legal policies with the AMPS board of 
directors and officers next week and would like, if possible, to meet with 
someone from such a firm or firms while I am there.  Do you know of or have a 
database that identifies such a law firm(s)?

Thanks

Mike and Jeff:

I am rethinking the legal reports.  Alan and I am preparing a monthly trading 
and transactional summary, a litigation report and the TOP TEN legal risk 
report.  To me the last two are the most important.  On a conceptual basis, 
is that what you need or want to see?

Mark

There is a proposal to have a meeting of the head traders of Enron, Reliant, 
Sempra, Coral, Duke, Southern, Dynergy and El Paso.  The idea would be to 
talk about e-commerce in the energy business.  Specifically, Enron might 
propose standardization of our masters, start-up of a clearing house for 
energy trading, electronic mechanism for confirmations, opening EOL to other 
companies to post bids and offers, and discuss electronic protocols for 
transactions with other energy companies to reduce costs.  We would probably 
discuss the state of regulatory restrictions under the CEA.

What are the anti-trust issues for such a meeting?
What are the appropriate parameters for such meeting?
Should legal counsel be in attendance?
Would it be best to make invitations through a formal letter?

US Regulators Find Flaws in Commodities Overhaul Bill
By Dawn Kopecki

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. financial regulators at a hearing Wednesday
faulted legislation aiming at rewriting the nation's commodities laws for
going too far in some areas at streamlining the laws overseeing derivatives
products and futures markets.

Some officials criticized the bill, introduced by Rep. Thomas Ewing, R-Ill.,
chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Risk Management, for
diminishing the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission over
certain derivatives products.

The legislation, as well as a companion bill introduced by Senate
Agriculture Chairman Richard Lugar, R-Ind., would streamline the laws
overseeing derivatives products and futures markets as well as deregulate
some aspects of that industry.

Lawmakers have been struggling all year to revamp those markets. The
Commodity Exchange Act - which expires Sept. 30 - determines which agency,
the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, has jurisdiction over
what derivatives products.

A tugging war between the two agencies over how to redraw those lines has
slowed progress on the legislation.

Annette Nazareth, director of the SEC's division of market regulation,
faulted Ewing's legislation for creating a new kind of deregulated futures
trading facility, but then giving the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over the
securities traded on those new facilities.

"The (SEC) does not believe that there is a justification for eliminating
the traditional role of other regulators, including the SEC, in regulating
markets and intermediaries that trade such government securities and other
products," Nazareth said in written testimony.

She noted that it's especially important that the SEC retain its authority
"when these products would be traded on facilities subject to even fewer
investor protections than exist today on futures exchanges."

Treasury assistant secretary Lewis Sachs also found that section of the bill
flawed, saying that his agency was concerned that Ewing's bill makes
regulatory oversight of clearinghouses optional, not mandatory. He was
similarly concerned about giving the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over all
transactions conducted within a clearinghouse.

"The exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC may preclude securities regulators
from maintaining oversight of organizations that clear securities-related
products," Sachs said in his written testimony. He added that regulation of
clearinghouses should be mandatory and that the SEC should oversee
clearinghouse transactions for products currently under its jurisdiction.

Nazareth also suggested that Ewing clarify a section of the bill so that it
clearly gives the SEC direct access to audit trails, coordinated market
surveillance and inspection authority to pursue insider trading and other
fraudulent practices regarding the trading of single-stock futures.

"The SEC should not be required to seek the permission of any other entity
to protect investors," she said.

Both Sachs and Nazareth found it "troublesome" that Ewing's bill has a lower
threshold than other proposals for determining what constitutes a
"sophisticated investor." That's important because the legislation allows
sophisticated investors to conduct a wide variety of transactions with the
least amount of scrutiny from federal regulators.

"We do not believe that adequate consideration has been given to whether $10
million in total assets is a sufficient indication of sophistication," she
said. "Moreover, the bill grants the CFTC broad discretion to declare anyone
an eligible contract participant."

Lugar's bill, as well as a report released last year by the nation's top
financial regulators, defines a sophisticated investors as having at least
$25 million in assets.

Sachs also had serious reservations about the way Ewing's bill relieves
regulatory burdens for futures markets, saying that there may be some
unintended consequences for "legislating" relief.

"Once such provisions are written into law, the regulators will have no
ability to review and amend them should subsequent market developments
warrant change or should other problems arise," Sachs said.

In addition, Sachs was troubled by some changes to the rules overseeing
government securities that, he said, could "undermine the laws that Congress
put in place in recent years that were designed to uphold and strengthen the
integrity of the government securities market."

Patrick Parkinson, associate director of the division of research and
statistics for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, also
criticized a section of the bill that he said would "leave uncertainty about
whether some electronic trading systems for financial contracts between
professional counterparties were subject to the (Commodities Exchange Act)."

C. Robert Paul, general counsel for the CFTC, had concerns of his own about
the legislation. He highlighted problems with the way the bill handles metal
and energy commodities as they relate to electronic trading systems.

For his part, Ewing warned regulators that Congress may run out of time to
pass the legislation this year if the agencies can't agree on key aspects of
the bill.

"I hesitate to say, let's pass those parts we agree on. It's pretty easy to
pat yourself on the back and just do the easy work," Ewing said.

Several lawmakers criticized the SEC and CFTC for holding up progress for
the sake of politics. The two agencies have deep differences of opinion over
how to regulate single-stock futures.

Ewing's bill gives the CFTC almost exclusive authority over single-stock
futures. The SEC wants to share jurisdiction over the new product.

"I really don't necessarily see this as a turf battle," Nazareth said
following her testimony. "There are significant challenges in crafting a
framework that protects investors in the way they have come to expect in the
securities market."


Dow Jones Energy Service, 6/15/00
Japan Online Power Trading May Spark More Deregulation
By Mika Watanabe

TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Partial deregulation of Japan's power industry in March
hasn't exactly charged up the country's power sector, as industrial and
commercial users have yet to take advantage of their newly-won freedom to
pick suppliers.

However, the launch of online electricity trading in Japan later this year
will likely lure more independent power suppliers into the market, spurring
trading activity and possibly prompting the government to take further
deregulation steps ahead of a scheduled review in March 2003, analysts say.

Among the early birds hoping to provide the catalyst for this process in the
form of a trading system are Japanese trading house Itochu Corp. (J.CIT or
8001) and the U.S.' Automated Power Exchange (X.AUP), which plan to launch a
Web-based electric power exchange in November.

U.S.-based Enron Corp. (ENE) has also launched its global EnronOnline
Internet trading platform for a variety of commodities and financial
products and is approaching companies here with the eventual target of
trading electricity.

"Even though the market will be limited initially, if the trading mechanism
were there, a substantial number of large-lot buyers who seek lower prices
would participate, while potential sellers who hold excess generation
capacity would also join in, to make money from their idle assets," said
Naoto Hashimoto, a senior utility analyst at Nomura Securities.

As of March, Japan's 8,000-odd high-volume industrial and commercial users -
which together represent 27% of total Japanese power demand - are now free
to choose their suppliers.

"The potential is enormous," agreed Hideki Yokoyama, general manager of
Itochu's power project group. "Though the performance (of our online
exchange) won't necessarily be stellar at first, its early launch should
pave a smooth way to grab some 65% of the Japanese electricity market, which
is slated to open in the next stage of deregulation within three years."

Yokoyama also noted a chicken-and-egg effect: while trading activity would
likely lead to faster deregulation, specific liberalization measures would
lead to more activity. Online electricity trading might take hold in Japan
sooner than expected if requirements discouraging potential entrants are
eased in response to growing complaints from various industries, he said.

Even after partial deregulation, independent power producers who want to
sell retail electricity are still fettered by several inflexible
requirements. For example, companies must sign a one-year or longer
transmission grid leasing contract and a costly back-up supply contract with
existing utilities.

Yokoyama predicts that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
might relax such requirements before the 2003 review.

"Potential entrants' calls for online trading could set a wave of e-commerce
in motion, and that would put added pressure on the regulators," he said.

Utilities' Participation Key To Boosting Liquidity

Experts concede that online electricity trading liquidity is likely to be
thin in the initial stage, but they say volume will snowball as domestic
utility giants enter the market.

APX and Itochu plan to form a joint venture in July for their online
exchange, tentatively called JPX, and expect Japanese utilities as well as
other energy concerns to invest in the Y1.5-billion venture.

"We will keep the door open for any regional power monopolies," said
Yokoyama, adding that some utilities are now studying the trading mechanism
with keen interest.

"It's just a matter of time before some farsighted existing utilities use
the new mechanism to hedge against potential risks such as losing customers
and falling prices, and this will consequently increase market liquidity,"
predicted Nomura's Hashimoto.

Outside the power concerns, the likely participation of other domestic
heavyweights, including Osaka Gas Co. (J.OSG or 9532) and Nippon Telegraph &
Telephone Corp. (NTT or 9432) should also provide a tremendous boost to the
electricity market, said Masanori Maruo, a Tokyo-based utility analyst at
Deutsche Securities Ltd.

NTT, Osaka Gas and Tokyo Gas Co. (J.TYG or 9531) already unveiled in March
their plan to team up in entering Japan's retail electricity business.

"Gas utilities and NTT hold massive excess power generation capacity, while
NTT is the country's largest electricity user which alone represents 0.5% of
entire domestic consumption," said Maruo. "The combination will be able to
play a significant role in electricity trading by taking a two-way position
to offset risks," he said.

In addition, some domestic and foreign financial firms, including Industrial
Bank of Japan Ltd. (J.IBJ or 8302) and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co.
(MWD), are set to offer various electricity-linked derivatives, designed to
manage risks from fluctuations in demand and prices. Such products could
spur further market participation of existing utilities as well as potential
sellers.

Analysts say the biggest long-term risks are those faced by utilities which
lag behind in doing business the new way. While market participation won't
bring them much financial gain, such power companies have the most
compelling need to hedge against price fluctuations, as they surrender their
price-setting monopolies to market forces.

"It may seem that power utilities have little to gain from participating in
online trading, but in fact, they have much to lose if they stay away from
the trading mechanism," as they fall behind in hedging risks, said
Hashimoto. "Eventually, they'd end up playing a loser's game."

Philippines Relaxes Banks' Requirement To Raise Capital

MANILA -- The Philippine Central Bank has decided to withdraw a requirement
for banks to raise their minimum capital for 2000, a move expected to ease
investors' concerns over the stability of the country's banking industry,
analysts said.

The decision to eliminate the third and final round of a capital increase
for banks effectively extends to Dec. 31, 2000, the deadline for compliance
with last year's minimum capital requirement of 4.95 billion pesos (122.2
million euros) for universal banks and 2.4 billion pesos for commercial
banks.

Originally, universal banks were required to raise their minimum capital to
5.3 billion pesos by the end of 2000, while commercial banks were required
to raise their minimum capital to 2.8 billion pesos.

In the Philippines, universal banks are commercial banks with expanded
licenses that allow them to venture into noncommercial banking operations
such as investment banking and fund management.

The central bank's decision to relax its capital rule will prevent a loss of
confidence in banks that would otherwise have had a difficult time meeting
the new requirement, said Angping & Associates Securities Inc. The move will
also prevent panic among depositors that could lead to heavy withdrawals at
banks or the banks' closure, Angping added.

The central bank's capital requirement for banks may be adjusted next year
in line with the new risk-based capital framework contained in the recently
passed General Banking Act.

The framework allows the central bank to impose new capital requirements
based on the activities banks are involved in and the capital risks tied to
them. Higher capitalization may be imposed, for instance, on banks engaged
in high-risk transactions such as derivatives trading, central bank Gov.
Rafael Buenaventura said.

The central bank implemented a three-stage increase of the minimum capital
of banks in 1998 in a bid to strengthen the banking system to prevent a
fallout from the Asian financial crisis. Ironically, however, the higher
capital requirements indirectly led to the closure of one commercial bank
and heavy withdrawals at two other banks earlier this year. Last month,
Urban Bank closed after experiencing a liquidity crunch after several days
of withdrawals by depositors.

The withdrawals were triggered by rumors that the bank's previous downgrade
to a thrift bank from a commercial bank was because of cash flow problems.
The bank was downgraded because it couldn't meet the original 2.4 billion
peso capital requirement deadline for commercial banks as of the end of
1999.


The Economist, 6/10/00
Danger Signs

An unusual thing happened this week in America. The prices of corporate
bonds rose. Of late they have proved a dreadful investment-worse by far than
government bonds. How much farther their prices will rise depends largely on
what happens in the market in which they are priced: the swaps market. That
market is in turmoil.

Swaps are the glue that binds together the world's financial system. First
developed in the early 1980s, they now dwarf other financial instruments. At
the end of last year there were some $46 trillion of swaps outstanding,
compared with $5.4 trillion in, for example, international bond markets.

Broadly, swaps come in two forms: interest-rate swaps and currency swaps.
Simply put, both allow parties to exchange cash-flows. In a currency swap,
the two exchange currencies and re-exchange them at maturity at the same
rate. In the meantime they exchange interest payments.  In a typical
interest-rate swap, one side exchanges a floating-rate obligation (generally
based on Libor, the rate at which the best banks lend to each other) for a
fixed one.

This simplicity has made swaps, and interest-rate swaps in particular, a
very useful tool.  They allow banks, for example, to match their assets and
liabilities much more closely. If they have lots of short-term floating-rate
liabilities (such as savings accounts) but long-term fixed-rate assets (such
as loans) they can "swap" long-term assets into short-term ones. Likewise,
companies can use swaps to convert fixed-rate debt (which investors might
prefer) into floating-rate debt, or vice versa.

The level of the fixed rate in the swap reflects, among other things, the
willingness of the market to accept corporate debt rather than government
debt, which means that the swap rate is calculated at a spread over
government bonds. Euro swap-spreads have risen in recent weeks, but dollar
swap-spreads have widened dramatically. Ten-year spreads peaked at the end
of May at 140 basis points (hundredths of a percentage point)-a higher
spread than ever before (see chart on next page). They have since narrowed,
but are still wider than at the height of the financial crisis that followed
Russia's default. At times in recent weeks, the swaps market has shut down
completely; nobody was willing to receive a fixed rate.

What on earth is going on? There are, broadly, two sets of explanations, one
relatively benign, the other emphatically not. The benign view is that the
rise in swap spreads is explicable by rising interest rates, greater default
risk, and the relative sizes of government-and corporate-bond markets.

Governments are issuing fewer bonds. On optimistic assumptions, America's
government could buy back all its debt by 2010. American companies, in
contrast, are borrowing hugely. That makes government bonds more valuable,
compared with corporate debt. It reflects what Stephen Compton, head of
bonds at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney in Europe, calls "the privatisation
of the bond markets".

Rising interest rates, too, are partly to blame for widening swap spreads.
When the market thinks that interest rates will rise, there is more of an
incentive to pay, rather than receive, a fixed rate. That incentive is
greater at times when, as now, long-term rates are lower than short-term
ones (an "inverted yield curve"). This means that anybody receiving a fixed
(long-term) rate and paying a floating one loses money.

Then there is the increase in corporate debt Credit Suisse First Boston
(CSFB) expects American companies to issue as many bonds this year as they
did last, when they sold record amounts. Importantly for swap spreads, one
reason that firms are borrowing so much is to buy back their shares. So
American companies are becoming ever more highly geared, and hence less
creditworthy. Share buy-backs are running at double last year's level and,
reckons David Goldman, a strategist at CSFB, will remain in vogue as long as
debt is relatively cheap, and firms' managers think that more leverage is
good for shareholder value.

If this were not enough, swap-market folk also point accusing fingers at
Gary Gensler, under-secretary at the American Treasury. In March, he said
that federally sponsored agencies, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which
everybody assumed were guaranteed by the government, were not. The yield on
their debt rose sharply. Since they are the biggest actors in the swaps
market, so did swap spreads.

Swap knot

Taken together, these factors might seem enough to explain what has
happened. But James Bianco, who runs an eponymous research firm, thinks they
are not. Swap spreads, he points out, have been widening for the past three
and a half years-before any of these other factors cropped up. And they do
not explain why swap spreads have risen so fast this year.

Mr. Bianco argues that two things dominate the pricing of interest-rate
swaps: interest rates and credit concerns. For most of the 1990S swap rates
went up and down with interest rates. That relationship has now largely
broken down, suggests Mr. Bianco, because markets have become more concerned
over risks to the financial system, as a result of the crises of recent
years. If Mr. Bianco is right, this has important ramifications: it suggests
there are growing worries about the riskiness of the swaps market, based on
fears about the health of financial firms-by far the biggest participants.

Pshaw, say critics: there is no credit risk in the swaps market. Forget
about those telephone-number figures: no principal amount is exchanged in a
swap, so what matters is not the "notional" amount at risk but the cost of
replacing the swaps-a far lower number. Moreover, big banks post collateral
if they are on the losing side of a swap, thus eliminating even any residual
risk.

Really? "Swaps are perceived as riskless. That must be wrong," says a
treasurer at a big bank. Unlike futures exchanges, the swaps market looks
only at current exposures, not potential ones (futures exchanges demand a
dollop of cash up front to cover the second). And the market has grown so
much that these potential risks are becoming huge.

So it is at least plausible that people are starting to fret about the
banking system. But why might this be a problem in America, of all places?
Because it is taking ever more risk to generate the returns demanded by
share-holders. Bank lending is growing by 10% at an annual rate, and
property lending by 13.5%, its highest rate since 1989. If anything, these
rates are accelerating because, after nine years of growth and few defaults,
banks' backward-looking risk models tell them that lending is a fine
business.

And not just in America. In Europe, too, banks are taking more risk to
generate higher returns. At best, the swap market is merely reflecting this
increase in risk. At worst, it might be signaling that the world's financial
system is in danger of becoming unglued.

Bryan -

I have a meeting scheduled with Mark on Monday at 4:00 to update him on the 
status of a number of item associated with our Department's technology 
plans.  I had hoped to update him on the status of the intraweb site; 
however, since no one from your group has contacted me to follow-up on our 
Sept. 29 meeting, I was wondering if you would be available to attend the 
meeting I have with Mark.  If so, I would hope that we could discuss issues 
pertinent to moving the process along as our goal is to have a functioning 
web site as soon as possible.  

Please let me know your availability and when I can expect some movement on 
this project.

Thanks.

		 Subject: Canadian Form of Physical Power Master

Further to the landslide of e-mails I have sent relating to this agreement, I 
hope that this will be the last as far as asking for input.  Over the last 
few days, the form of the paper pursuant to which Enron Canada will trade 
physical power in Canada has been reviewed and (I think) finalized by legal 
in Calgary and Houston and the commercial people in Calgary.  We have 
determined that it is in the best interest of Enron to jointly promote the 
Edison Electric Institute (EEI) form of master which, as I described in my 
e-mail of yesterday, consists of a standardized base contract with an 
amending section, much like the ISDA form of financial master.  However, as 
the current form of the EEI master is a US document, containing many US 
specific provisions that have no application in Canada, commercially it has 
been identified as a concern that, with respect to counterparties that are 
not sophisticated trading companies, selling a US document with a Canadian 
addendum will be difficult if not impossible.

Therefore, we are going to proceed to finalize the form of "industrial 
master" that I have drafted and sent out numerous times for review, a copy of 
which I enclose in both a clean and black-lined version (black-lined to the 
most recent draft distributed to you) in what I now believe is, in fact, 
final form.  Our commercial people can use this form, together with the form 
of GTC I distributed to most of you earlier today, to market power in Alberta 
to counterparties who will not accept the EEI form.

We will immediately begin the process of supporting the use of the EEI form 
in Canada but will propose that a Canadian form of base contract be agreed to 
and implemented, thereby eliminating the problem of using a US document as 
the base contract for Canadian transactions.  I will begin the process of 
trying to create a first draft of this base contract which, other than with 
respect to removing US references and incorporating specific Canadian 
principles, will be identical to the US form.  I will also commence the 
process of preparing what Enron believes the form of addendum to this 
Canadian base contract should be.

Sorry for the lengthy e-mail, but I wanted to ensure that everyone was 
completely up-to-date with the status and process.  I believe that this 
solution will address everyone's concerns without jeopardizing commercial 
transactions in Alberta.

Thanks

Greg

This looks fine to me.

As we have previously discussed, I think in the special circumstance of Scott 
Tholan (Director), we should put in place a Power-of-Attorney to permit him 
to sign: (1) confidentiality agreements and (2) consulting agreements related 
to the competitive analysis projects. We can put a one year time limit on the 
POA as suggested in your memo. Please confirm that you are ok with this so 
that I can put the POA in place.  If you agree, please advise if I need to 
copy John L. and/or Dave on the POA.

I would like to do fewer resolutions authorizing non-vps to sign contracts, 
and when we need such authorizations, let's make sure the resolutions are 
appropriately limited.  My thoughts are as follows:

1.   We have a lot of vps that can sign contracts.
2.   It is generally ok to have confirmations signed by certain carefully 
selected directors since we are confirming a trade that already took place 
and there is master agreement already signed.
3.   There are certain very routine agreements like pipeline right-of-way 
agreements that are ok for carefully selected directors to sign.
4.   Confidentiality agreements should be signed by a vp.
5.   Any authorization for a director to sign should expire within not more 
than one year and revoke all prior authorizations.

Please give me your comments.

Mark

Mark:

It never fails.  Ironically, within an hour after hitting the "Send" button 
on my prior e-mail to you, I got a call from Stephanie, Jim's assistant, 
informing me that Jim's travel schedule for the first week in September had 
changed since I had set up the appointment and so we are going to have to 
reschedule the meeting with him.  Stephanie gave me a couple of possible 
dates in late Sept. and the middle of October that I need to follow up with 
Steve and Peter on.  Once I circle back with them, I'll follow up with you to 
see what may work for you.

Since I am scheduled to have a meeting in your offices on the morning of the 
7th, I still plan to be in Houston.  Is there a chance that you and I could 
get together for lunch on the 6th or perhaps catch up for a few minutes that 
afternoon or the afternoon of the 7th?

I'll touch base with you to see what your schedule looks like.  Thanks.  John

Well done!  Please send a copy of the plan to the OGC and work with Janette 
to schedule a meeting of the OGC to review the plan and get buy-in across the 
group.  Let's schedule the meeting for 1and 1/2 hours.  I would like you in 
the mean time to focus on a time line to implement the program.  Also, please 
set up a meeting for you and me with Phillippe Bibi to discuss getting help 
from IT to implement our plan.

Mark,

I am sorry that we will not be meeting up on Friday. I understand that you
have had to cancel your trip over here. Are you likely to make it over here
in the near future? If not, shall we get together at some point when I am in
the US (I'd like an excuse to get to Houston!).

All the best.

Mark,

Just wanted to let you know that Sheila has been doing a truly outstanding 
job for West Power lately.  There has been some big, thankless challenges 
related to transacting around our new finance vehicle, Turbopark, and she 
might feel a little beat up by the experience, but she has performed 
extremely well.

ISDA staff will give them regulatory background in US and Europe.  I thought
it might be worthwhile for them to hear a business/legal perspective as

Per our conversation on coordination of our efforts on California and other 
jurisdictions, we have developed the following training program:

1.    Anti-trust -- we have completed anti-trust training in Houston for 
traders and have scheduled it in Portland and Calgary.

2.    Sales Practices -- this training has been completed in Portland and is 
being scheduled in Houston and Calgary.

3.    Anti-manipulation -- this training has been completed in Portland, but 
needs to be expanded to cover local law manipulation issues.  It also needs 
to be scheduled in Houston and Calgary. 

Also, the above training needs to be supplemented with training on local 
power pool rules.  There is a similar program being prepared in London.  A 
meeting is being scheduled so we can discuss these matters further.

In reviewing the contracts, so far I have the following questions:

1.     Have Oman LNG and ADgas taken the risk of non-performance by DPC and 
indirectly MSEB without any credit support?  The only security is the equity 
in DPC?  Are such contracts typically secured or done with a buyer with deep 
pockets?  How much value was put into DPC by the shareholders?

2.     Are there local public policy issues that could be addressed by local 
courts with respect to the LNG contracts?  Fraud?  Bribery?  Are there any 
local law issues with respect to performance or interpretation of the 
contracts?  Isn't take-or-pay meaningless without credit support?

3.     What are the arguments for DPC to terminate the contracts?  Only where 
the PPA is terminated?  Payments?

4.    Who negotiated the contracts?  Were there requests for credit support?  
>From Enron?  Did Enron ever promise to indirectly "backstop" the contracts by 
its investment in Dabhol?

5.   What was the discussion regarding the "reduction in operational 
capability" language in the contracts?  What was the language meant to 
cover?  Do we need our counterparty's approval to investigate other markets?

6.    Is there any argument that DPC has already breached the contracts?  
Could our counterparties issue a press release claiming damages over the 
entire term of the contract? Confidentiality and press releases?

7.    What is the law on piercing the corporate veil for an Indian company 
like DPC?  Could this issue be considered separate from the contract and be 
litigated in India or Oman and thus outside the arbitration?

8.     What is the list of all documents that could impact on whether or not 
Enron has any exposure under the LNG contracts?

9.     Are there instances where the Dabhol project could fail and the LNG 
contracts would not novate to MSEB?  Why does it matter if the LNG contract 
obligations novate to MSEB if DPC has no money?

10.   Other potential claims against Enron if the LNG contracts are 
terminated or not performed?

		 Subject: Commodity Exchange Act Passes Congress

Congress Passes the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000

Late Friday afternoon, December 15, Congress passed the Commodity Futures 
Modernization Act of 2000.  The purpose of the Act is to eliminate 
unnecessary regulation of commodity futures exchanges and other entities 
falling within the  coverage of the Commodities Exchange Act ("CEA") and the 
provide legal certainty with regard to certain futures and derivatives 
transactions.  By enacting such changes, Congress intends to promote product 
innovation and to enhance the competitive position of US financial markets. 
Certain provisions of the Act open the door for Enron's further product 
innovation and growth.  Specifically, the Act provides important legal 
certainty for energy and other transactions occuring both on an 
over-the-counter (OTC) bilateral basis and on multilateral electronic trading 
platforms.  Enron was a leading advocate of passage of this legislation.

Bilateral Transactions

Under the Act, bilateral transactions in all commodities (other than 
agriculture commodities) that do not occur on trading facility (i.e. not on a 
multi-party exchange) are exempt from most provisions of the CEA as long as 
the transactions are entered solely between "eligible contract 
participants"(i.e. persons and certain legal entities satisfying capital 
thresholds and other requirements under the Act).  This provision essentially 
codifies and expands existing CFTC exemptions for swaps and forward 
contracts, thereby eliminating a degree of legal ambiguity that has 
frustrated product innovation and growth.  

Multilateral Transactions

In addition, the Act creates a broad exemption for any agreement, contract or 
transaction in commodities (other than agriculture commodities) so long as 
they the transactions are between "eligible commercial participants", are 
entered into on a "principle-to-principle basis" and that take place on a 
multi-party "electronic facility".  This exemption could facilitate expansion 
of EnronOnline to allow for multi-party transactions, however certain legal 
requirements will have to be met.

Other Transactions

The Act also creates a broad exclusion for a number of commodities that are 
of interest to Enron, including "credit risk measure" commodities and weather 
derivatives .  Again, the derivative transaction exclusion will have to meet 
certain legal thresholds.

This legislation has been over six years in the making and the collective 
support of many Enron employees has been crucial.  Thank you to all that have 
contributed to the passage on this important legislation.  We will have a 
more through legal summary of this legislation in the near future. Do not 
hesitate to contact me at (202) 466- 9158 of Mark Taylor at (713) 853-7459 
with any questions.

		 Subject: Lawyer Intervew for EEOS position 

As i have mentioned, I need to fill the vacant Carlos Sole slot here at EEOS. 
Vicki had agreed this, but I wanted to run this past you before I move on 
it.  Between the work we do to support the ENA projects, the Pipeline Group 
work, and our claims and litigation, I think I do need to fill the vacancy 
with a lawyer.

I have identified a candidate that has significant construction experience 
that I would like to bring in next Tuesday afternoon for an initial screen, 
but before I do that I wanted to see if you are on board with me filling the 
slot.  

I  would not trouble you with an interview request unless after I meet her I 
think she is a strong enough candidate to pursue further.

		 Subject: NGX/CEL Litigation - Agenda for Tomorrow

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

I think we need to talk to the following issues tomorrow:

1.  Status update on court proceedings;

2.  Evidentiary matters, including:

(a)  formal industry support for our position - without it, we are fighting 
an uphill battle, and I understand the other side will be filing evidence of 
industry support for their position; and 

(b)  a detailed and focused analysis of the pre-NGX and post-NGX index 
consequences, in terms of volume and pricing consequences - our analysis to 
date has proven weak;

3.  Goals, including can we live with the risk of no CGPR AECO index.  In 
other words, our best argument is likely that CGPR cannot pass off what it 
purports to be an AECO index reflecting the broader market, but NGX (and EOL 
for that matter) are free to publish their own index.  The result might be 
that NGX (or EOL for that matter) is free to publish their own index, 
provided it is not passed of as being the CGPR AECO index reflecting the 
broader market, and Enerdata then must publish the broader index, if it 
wishes, as the CGPR AECO index.  However, if CGPR chose not to continue 
publishing, it is likely going to be free to do so, with the effect that 
there would be no CGPR AECO index as referred to in our Confirms and 
Transactions, which would have to then be altered to account for a separate 
and new index, which for the time being could be NGX or EOL.

I have asked our outside lawyers to join in on the call at 2:00 p.m. (Calgary 
time) tomorrow.

Peter

I am very interested in Steve and think we could use him in addition to 
Shari.  The only problem is that I agreed that I would not try to recruit him 
so the firm would agree to let us second him.  We just need to proceed slowly 
with him and hopefully it will work out to our benefit.

		 Subject: Steve Hall

By the way, I spoke to Chris Foster and Greg Wolfe about the relative merits 
of Steve Hall and Shari Stack.  Their thinking was that Steve is probably a 
better "deep thinker" (to use Elizabeth's words) but that he might be bored 
with the routine transaction work that Shari seems to really enjoy.  He also 
doesn't have the ISDA background which would provide tremendous benefit to 
us.  Therefore, I think Shari is a better fit for our current needs.  

Having said that, I am extremely impressed with Steve.  He has a better 
handle on this California work than anyone I've worked with yet.  He seems 
really bright and responsive.  I talked to him last week about working for 
Enron and he seemed interested.  I didn't get into any details about our 
needs, but gauged his general level of interest in the work that he is doing 
for us and his willingness to consider jobs other than his current one.  He 
basically said that he would be happy to hear about opportunities here.  I 
was talking to Richard Sanders yesterday and he also is impressed with Steve 
and said that he had considered trying to hire him.  I don't know if there is 
a position for Steve or not.  I just wanted to give you feedback on my 
discussions with him.  Let me know if you need any help or information from 
me on this matter.

Regards,
Tim

I spoke to Dr. Emilio Pinto, at the Sao Paulo lawfirm of Tozzini Freire about 
joining ISDA.  He and his firm are doing a lot of work for Enron.  He is 
familiar with ISDA and said he was interested in joining.  I told him he 
would get a call and some materials that he could present to his Executive 
Committee.  I reviewed with him the cost of $10,000.  Please give him a call 
at 011-551-1-2322100.  I think he could help build membership in ISDA in 
Brazil and eventually become a rep office for ISDA in South America.  He goes 
by Emilio.  I am working on a lawfirm in Argentina.  Let  me know if you have 
any questions.

This is for routine and "small" matters only.  The resolutions are drafted so 
that the signature authority is narrow and specific.   Frequency is only one 
factor.   An example would be certain defined right-of-way agreements and 
certain defined confirms.  I will review the authority that has been 
delegated currently.  [Julia and Deb, please pull the existing resolutions

Well, I talked with legal about this and I understand that they can and do 
give signature authority to directors on a relatively frequent basis. I gave 
them the parameters for Ben to make it even easier. If they end up saying 
it's a bigger issue than originally articulated, I'll continue with Ben as we

Attached is a draft arbitration demand our outside counsel has prepared on 
the confidentiality issue only.  For what it is worth, outside counsel does 
have some concerns with just arbitrating the confidentiality issue. First, 
they raise the possibility that by only raising the confidentiality issue, we 
might be waiving the guaranty assignability issue. To try to prevent this 
argument, you will note that we have put preservation language in the 
arbitration statement of claim.  We will need to do some additional legal 
research to make sure that would do the trick.  Second, outside counsel tends 
to think the two claims together (confidentiality and the guarantee 
assignability) work better together.  Let's talk soon.

Mark, 

Per my telephone conversation with Margaret Gerhardt, I want to thank you 
very much for your interest in participating on the e-commerce panel for the 
Energy Bar Association mid-year program.? Margaret suggested that you be 
listed on the program brochure as "invited," in case a conflict should arise. 
The Association will be distributing a final brochure at a later date which 
will reflect any changes in speakers.? Attached for your information is a 
draft program brochure and a brief overview of the? e-commerce panel.? The 
Association believes that the e-commerce panel is timely given the dramatic 
impact that electronic commerce is having on the economy generally, and in 
particular due to the unprecedented changes taking place in the energy 
industries.? Having the perspective of EnronOnline, the industry leader, will 
be a great addition to the program. 

Please let me know if you have questions or need additional information.? I 
look forward to seeing you at the program.

Wanted to let you know the status on the following:
Working with Ivy Bradberry (with the Image Center) on the cost & production 
of the animated invitation.
Should have all catering proposals by Tuesday, June 5.
I will have a cost estimate and approval form prepared for you no later than

Questions for you:
Do you have any idea how many children are expected?
What was the final decision on the starting time for the program?

Thanks.

Jordan:  Travis is going to give you a call about keeping up to speed on some 
of the year end deals.  Would it make sense for Travis or someone else to 
attend any of your staff meetings?  Or maybe you could attend ours or both.  
Let me know what you think.

Dear Mark:

I am trying to find a suitable venue and date to hold ISDA's Energy
Conference in Houston.  At the moment I have on hold Tuesday, March 6, 2001
at the Four Seasons Hotel in Houston.  

Please let me know if March 6th is a suitable date to hold Energy
Conference.  Also, please advise on the number of breakout rooms you would
recommend us to book for the afternoon sessions.  We previously had four
breakout workshops: (1) Electricity Derivatives, (2) Coal Derivatives, (3)
Weather Derivatives and 
(4) Natural Gas and Other Energy Derivatives.  

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
Liz

Mark

There are a lot of art galleries in Sao Paulo, but I am not sure what you 
like.  The place I was telling you about is Galeria Jacques Ardies.  Jacques' 
gallery is one of the two best (I think) specializing in contemporary 
Brazilian "naif" artists.  Most of his stuff is really interesting, vibrant, 
"Brazilian" pieces (many from the Northeast of Brazil where they have the 
greatest African influence and a very rich culture).  Kind of funky and "out 
there,"  but I really like it.  He also has some terrific textile works by 
Madeleine Colaco, an artist who has become very popular in the United States 
(we have one of her wall hangings in our den).

Jacques' web site is at http://ardies.com/quemingl.htm.  I don't think it is 
very representative of what you will find there, but take a look.

There are plenty of other galleries that you can go to as well. Let's talk 
about what you want to see on the way down, and I will give it some thought.

By the way,  I am scheduled to have lunch with Lance on Thursday, and I have 
a phone call into Alan asking for a time with him as well.  I will keep you 
posted.

Regards,
Randy

FYI, Mark Haedicke from Legal informed me that there is some sort of conflict 
and consequently legal concerns over hiring John Bloomer as outside 
consultant.  As a contract with him would probably not be approved by Legal 
we won't further pursue to hire him for our technical due diligence.

Lavo/Mark, although it has been a chronic problem, the seemingly inexcusable 
delay at processing guarantees by Enron Corp. (both Enron Corp. and 
Counterparty) seems to be getting worse of late.  It is becoming an 
impediment to transacting and to our reputation in the market as the largest 
and most responsive energy marketer.  As you know, our business is 
essentially transacted off Enron Corp.'s credit, and procuring guarantees is 
often unnecessarily difficult and time consuming.  I know that Commercial, 
Credit and Legal are all frustrated by the process.  I know Bill is seeing if 
there is something he can do, but I was wondering whether there was also 
something you could do to speak to this issue in Houston.

Peter.

Dear Mark,

We, at IBJ, started working on developing Japanese language confirms of
weather- and energy derivatives. We would like to make them as identical
to the standard document adopted by the market makers like yourselves as
possible.

I would appreciate if you could bring some of your standard form
confirms with you to London, although most of them would look exotic
enough to our traders.

Thank you in advance and see you next week.

That is a very interesting question.  I think we would eventually want to 
include derivatives in the cross default trigger because of their 
significance.  However, since we often have the far larger derivative 
position, it would seem at least now, this would more often work against us.

I would like to be kept up to date on who the potential candidates are.  We 
are planning on inviting Newsome to speak at our ISDA conference in March.

Thanks,

As the Bush transition moves forward, we need to monitor (or perhaps try to 
influence) the selection of the new CFTC Chair/Commissioners. 

As noted below, Jim Newsome has been selected as Acting Chair.  I mentioned 
this to Ken Raisler and Stacy Carey.  Everyone agrees that Newsome is a known 
quantity, though he may not be a superstar in the mold of Bill Ranier.   Ken 
said Newsome knows our issues and is favorable to a "free market" approach to 
energy and metals.  However, there is some concern about his ability to reign 
in the CFTC staff.  Newsome is the favorite currently for the position with 
boosters in Senators Lott and Cochran and his college roommate Rep. Jerry 
Moran (R-KS).  However, it is still early in the game and unknown Chair 
candidates could still be out there (including officials passed over for more 
high profile positions).

If Newsome is nominated as the Chair, an additional Commissioner (a 
Republican) position opens and will be named by Speaker Denny Hastert.  
Hastert is from the suburbs and the assumption is that he the Chicago 
exchanges may influence the appointment.  Stacy Carey is poking around to 
determine what Chicago exchanges are thinking.   One name that has been 
mentioned often is retired Congressman Tom Ewing who has expressed interest 
in a Commission seat, but not the Chair (Ewing is supportive of our issues).

David Spears is also likely to leave, but no date has been announced.  This 
is also a Republican seat.  The Democrats Barbara Holum and Tom Erickson are 
likely to stick around until their terms expire.

We can try to float names of persons we would like to see either Chair or 
join the Commission.  Also, we have learned that Wendy Gramm has list of 
names she may be shopping around for CFTC and SEC - it would be good the see 
who Gramm is proposing.

Please advise how you want to proceed in either reviewing or suggesting the 
appointees.

Thanks - Chris

Newsome Elected Acting Chair;
Favors 'Free-Market' Philosophy

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has elected Jim Newsome as its 
acting chairman, the agency announced Jan. 5. 
Newsome, a Republican, will assume the role played by outgoing Chairman 
William Rainer, who announced last month that he would resign his position 
effective Jan. 19. 
Newsome, a native of Plant City, Fla., was nominated to the CFTC in July 1998 
and sworn in Aug. 10 that same year. Immediately before joining the 
commission, Newsome was chairman of the Mississippi Agribusiness Council and 
served as executive vice president of the Mississippi Cattlemen's Association 
and Mississippi Beef Council. 

Levels of Oversight

Newsome, who could not be reached for comment Jan. 5, told BNA last month 
that he favors a "free-market philosophy," something he said helped him work 
productively with the like-minded Rainer, who was a Democrat. He praised in 
particular the CFTC's new regulatory framework that was approved by the 
commission last fall. The rulemaking largely was withdrawn after Congress 
essentially codified the initiative in the Commodity Futures Modernization 
Act passed in December. 
The new tiered-system creates different levels of oversight meant to 
differentiate between different levels of investor sophistication. "We've 
tried to develop a much more flexible regulatory scheme that allows for more 
competition for futures markets participants," Newsome said.

Please review and give me your comments on the attached proposal re adopting

proposal works for our international transactions.  Let me know.  I would

ISDA is planning an energy seminar in Tokyo in mid-May.  We have heard there 
may be an energy seminar in March or April in Tokyo.  Have you heard of the 
earlier seminar?  We are trying to decide whether it makes sense to go 
forward on the May seminar.  Could you look into this and talk to the traders.

Thanks for your help.

My particular concern is that the large majority of Enron's derivatives 
business is in North America.  We are growing rapidly in derivatives in 
Europe, but still quite small.  In terms of derivatives, we are not a factor 
on other continents.  That is different than major equity, currency or 
interest rate traders.

I would like to change our policy regarding taping telephone trades.  I 
propose the following:

1.   Retention Period  -- change the retention period from 4 months to 2 
months

2.  Record Only Deal Terms -- change from taping everything to taping only 
the deal terms at the end of a call

The first change could be made immediately and the second change would 
require both reprogramming (Phillippe is looking at this) and training of the 
traders to press the record button at the end of a call to record the deal 
terms.  Let me know your thoughts on the proposed changes.

I am confused by this.  Does this mean Cuiaba in South America would be 
covered?  What is the significance if it is?

Subject: EGPP Purchase Right Agreement

Rob:
 As we discussed, the Purchase Right Agreement terminates on January 1, 2005. 
 Therefore, if an Eligible Project commences Commercial Operations before 
January 1, 2005 (or if before January 1, 2005, an Enron Party acquires an 
Ownership Interest in an Eligible Project that has commenced Commercial 
Operations) and Limited Recourse Financial Closing has occurred with respect 
to such Eligible Project, then the Enron Party must offer to sell to EGPP the 
Ownership Interest of such Enron Party in such Eligible Project in accordance 
with the Purchase Right Agreement.

An Eligible Project is any Designated Development Project or Future Project 
in which an Enron Party holds or aquires an Ownership Interest.

A Future Project is any Power Plant or Natural Gas Pipeline (other than the 
Designated Development Projects) that is located within the Territory and on 
which construction has commenced or has been completed, provided that 
pipelines primarily designed to transport liquefied natural gas or natural 
gas liquids are excluded from Future Projects.

The Territory is all geographic areas of the World, excluding areas within 
the boundaries of the United States, Canada and Western Europe.

Please let me know if you need further explanation.  Thanks.

Kelly

In a moment of weakness I agreed to divide up the tickets.   I will divide
the tickets up in a manner that is absolutely perfect and totally equitable.

Please let me know if you know of any particular time or times when, for
example, you'll be on vacation or otherwise absent where you would prefer
not to be assigned games.  In addition, I am assuming that both of you would
prefer weekends to week nights (let me know if that's not the case).  And
let me know if you have any other scheduling issues.

Also, the third exhibition game is this Saturday night against the Spurs.  I
believe each of you said you couldn't make it.  I'll plan to give them away
unless you will be able to use them.  I need to know by tomorrow, however.

Here's the regular season schedule, and I will also be glad to take into
account your preferences on particular games if you'll send me an email
indicating the games you'd like. (or print this out, check games you'd like
and fax it to me at 512/236-3210).

A couple of other thoughts:

1.  Aggressively pursue litigation claims and manage litigation risks.
2.  Build contracts and legal infrastructure to support new businesses like 
paper.
3.  Develop top talent in the firms to assist getting all our deals done.

I think New York is a fair compromise, for North American transactions.  
Litigating in London is very expensive so I think that is not a good 
alternative.  Mark

Hey Mark,

Enron Canada Corp. is currently negotiating an amended and restated master 
agreement with Direct Energy Marketing Limited ("Direct") and we are in the 
process of negotiating the guarantee we will be receiving from Centrica plc 
on behalf of Direct.  

Centrica will be providing a guarantee which covers physical gas and 
electricity transactions as well as financial transactions between Direct and 
a company called Accord Energy Limited with:

1.  Enron Canada Corp.;
2.  Enron North America Corp.;
3.  Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited; and
4.  Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.

The one key sticking point relates to the governing law is to be England and 
the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of English courts.

I have suggested to the counterparty that we use New York law as a 
compromise.  However, in the event that they will not accept the amendment, 
are you okay with using the law of England and the exclusive jurisdiction of 
English courts?

Please let me know your thoughts when you have the opportunity.  You can 
reach me in Houston at 52520 and in Calgary at 820-6708.

Thanks,

Mark Powell

Why wouldn't we use the EEI form in Ontario?  The markets will be integrated, 
at least in part, into the US.  We could have an annex for Ontario.  We will 
be using the EEI form right across the border in the US.  Let 's chat about 
this.

Chris, Greg is putting the finishing touches on the Power Master as well as a 
GTC.

Greg, Chris needs the Master form ASAP so we can take the lead on this 
Ontario industry form development iniative.  Can you finalize the form and 
prepare a bullet point memo as requested by Chris comparing the differences 
between our form and EEI.

Greg, also you should coordinate a Calgary office meeting with traders and 
originators (not more than 1 hour) to unveil and explain the form ASAP.  
Alberta Market Opening and PPA trading commences Jan 1/01 and we may need 
push to get Masters signed or rely on GTC in the short term.

Chris, you should do likewise in Toronto when appropriate.

Milly, would it be a worthwhile expense for Greg to attend the firstOntario 
industry meeting in Toronto with Chris, as Greg has the background on 
developing the form?

Mark and Elizabeth, FYI.

Peter.

Subject: Power Master

Greg - Sorry to keep bothering you on the Power Master, but I was wondering 
what is the ETA for the form?  The reason I ask is that I am going to be 
involved in the industry push here in Ontario to develop a standard physical 
bilateral agreement.  While it is my understanding that many participants 
want to start with the EEI form and OPGI believes that they already have a 
next to final form, for obvious reasons Peter and Milly would like to see our 
form become the industry standard.

Another thing that would be helpful is a brief memo describing the 
differences between the EEI form and our form and the rationale for the 
differences.  Some of this may be readily apparent from running a blackline, 
but I would like to have the benefit of the knowledge you have built up in 
developing the form.  

Timing of this is fairly tight as the next meeting on this initiative is 
November 9th.  My goal is to show up at the meeting and advocate a 
"Canadianized" version of the EEI form and then describe the great time and 
effort Enron has expended on this already and table our draft as a starting 
point.

Apparently EEI will also be in attendance.  I will follow up with Elizabeth 
Sager on what is the status of our relationship with EEI and what was the US 
experience in developing the EEI master.

Regards
CJG

I think this is a detrimental reliance case or fraud.  I want to be 
aggressive on this.  Richard, please let me know what theory is best.  Do we 
have counsel for Washington?

		 Subject: Puget Sound requests NW price caps

In the days immediately before the application for a price cap, Puget came to 
us and asked us to enter into several put options.  We did so. I am advised 
by the traders that if this price cap were to actually be in effect,  our put 
option transactions would not make sense for us economically and we would 
never have entered into them had we known of their intention to make this 
filing.   I am under some pressure  to explain two things:  (i) whether the 
fact that they knew they were going to file for the cap when they did the 
options is some kind of fraud, and (ii) whether the WSPP Agreement or our 
ISDA swap agreements have any clauses in them to address this kind of 
thing,ie. is this some kind of "illegality" issue?  I am working on the 
second issue and have discussed it with Mark Taylor, but on the first issue, 
I need advice from Richard and anyone else who can help.----cgy

Puget Sound has filed a complaint against all jurisdictional sellers of 
wholesale energy and/or capacity in the Pacific Northwest, including parties 
to WSPP agreement.  Puget Sound requests FERC to impose price cap on 
wholesale sales of energy and capacity in the Pacific Northwest equal to the 
lowest price cap "established, ordered, or permitted by the Commission for 
wholesale purchases by the Cal ISO or Cal PX . . . ."  Puget requests an 
effective date of December 25,2000.

1.  Legal Risk Report -- developed the concept of the legal risk report for 
ECT.  I began reporting and managing the ECT legal risks on that basis.  This 
resulted in a better understanding of legal risks such as the power contract 
risks.  There will be many collateral benefits for the company as a result of 
this new technology for legal risks such as better decision making on 
transactions and faster focus on solving problems.
   
   2.   Developed and implemented new Chinese Wall Policy  --  in the face of 
almost daily breaches of the then existing policy, a new policy was developed 
that is fashioned to fit the unique business of ECT.  The traders and 
originators helped design the policy and have "bought in".  Training was 
completed in June.  This new policy should reduce our SEC risk, while at the 
same time, allow us to take advantage of certain information.

   3.  Lead power industry to develop a standardized form  --  pushed ISDA 
and EEI to work with the major IOU's to jointly develop a standard master 
trading form for power.  The form is now 80% complete and is modeled after 
the ECT form.  The result will be a significant saving of legal time and 
effort and more transactions will be completed in the industry with less risk 
of an unintended default.

   4.  Cutting edge legal work -- identified and solved many cutting edge 
legal questions in connection with the start-up of many ECT businesses.  
These businesses include (i) the acquisition of competitive information, (ii) 
weather, coal, emissions, band- width and electronic trading, and (iii) 
acquisition of businesses through contract such as contemplated in the UI and 
the Peoples deals.

   5.  Carolina Power & Light -- after filing suit against CP&L, acheiving a 
settlement at 90% of the value, despite difficult legal issues.

   6.  Deals are Us  --  lots and lots of deals done.  Legal built a closer 
relationship with several difficult groups with improved results for the 
company.

PG&E's Rate Cap Proposal: Leading the Charge for Re-Regulation, or Protecti=

Itself from Economic Disaster?=20
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (PG&E), in filings with the California Public=20
Utilities Commission (CPUC) and California Independent System Operator=20
(Cal-ISO), has requested that a rate cap be placed on wholesale purchases=
=20
in the state. The utility is asking the CPUC to lower the current rate=20
cap from $250 per megawatt hour to $100, or 10 cents per kilowatt hour.=20
In seeking the rate cap, PG&E is joined by Edison International, the parent=
=20
company of Southern California Edison, and The Utility Action Network (TURN=
),=20
a ratepayer advocacy group.

ANALYSIS: The current rate cap of $250 per megawatt hour in the wholesale=
=20
market of California resulted from the price spikes experienced in San=20
Diego this summer. As San Diego Gas & Electric had paid off its stranded=20
costs, the retail rate freeze in its area was lifted and SDG&E customers=20
were exposed to market-based prices, which doubled and at times tripled=20
due to increased demand in the state and power supply concerns. PG&E=20
customers=20
were not exposed to the price spikes because, at the time, PG&E had not=20
paid off its own stranded costs and was still under a retail rate freeze.

Yet the company has felt the impact from the price spikes just the same.=20
PG&E buys a great deal of its power on the wholesale market, and as a resul=
t=20
is about $2.2 billion in debt (some figures suggest it is as high as $2.7=
=20
billion). Due to the retail rate freeze still in effect, PG&E has been=20
unable to pass this debt on to customers by raising its rates. In real=20
terms, PG&E was paying up to 19 cents per kilowatt hour on the wholesale=20
market this summer, when by law it was only allowed to charge its customers=
=20
on average 5 cents per kilowatt hour. In total, PG&E has paid about $2.7=20
billion more to suppliers than it can bill customers for, and this amount=
=20
is growing by hundreds of millions each month. This explains the utility's=
=20
motivation in wanting to see the CPUC further lower the cap on wholesale=20
rates in California.

However, even though PG&E as a whole is in debt, the utility=01*as well as=
=20
other divisions under parent company PG&E Corp.=01*is still making money of=
f=20
deregulation in California. For instance, PG&E's Diablo Canyon nuclear=20
plant has been able to capitalize on the high value of power on the wholesa=
le=20
market. The utility confirmed recently that altogether its power facilities=
=01*
the=20
ones left after the utility was forced to divest the bulk of its power=20
assets=01*still provide about $150 million a month to the utility. In addit=
ion,=20
PG&E Corp.'s unregulated energy commodity trading operation has been doing=
=20
very well. And the unregulated National Energy Group=01*which operates in=
=20
markets outside of California, such as Massachusetts, Rhode Island and=20
New Hampshire=01*posted a 233-percent profit increase for the second quarte=
r.=20
Thus, it is important to note the distinction between PG&E and its parent,=
=20
PG&E Corp. Ironically, as a whole, PG&E Corp. has stated that it does not=
=20
support rate caps, and has opposed the issue when it has surfaced in other=
=20
states.

PG&E reported second-quarter earnings of $216 million on $2.3 billion in=20
revenue, representing a 26-percent increase over the same quarter last=20
year. Third quarter earnings also reportedly will be strong. This puts=20
PG&E in an awkward predicament. On one hand, PG&E wants to convince=20
shareholders=20
that the company is doing well and making money from the commodities that=
=20
it sells. On the other hand, PG&E is attempting to convince regulators=20
that it is losing money due to the high wholesale prices that it must pay=
=20
for power. In fairness, though, the revenue PG&E has earned cannot come=20
anywhere near to paying off the massive debt the company has accrued due=20
to its obligation of serving customers.

PG&E's rate freeze is scheduled to end March 31, 2002, at the very latest,=
=20
or sooner if it is determined that PG&E's stranded costs have been repaid,=
=20
something that utility executives say may already have taken place. Due=20
to higher-than-expected revenues and higher-than-market valuations of the=
=20
utility's assets, it may very well be the case that PG&E's stranded costs=
=20
are already paid off. When this is officially determined by the CPUC, PG&E=
=20
will argue that customers should be liable for some or all of the debt=20
it has assumed while the rate caps were in place. The CPUC has scheduled=20
a hearing to address these issues on Oct. 19. The core question of these=20
proceedings will be whether or not PG&E should be allowed to turn over=20
its debt to customers through rate increases once the rate freeze is lifted=
.=20
PG&E wants to be able to retroactively bill customers for its debt, based=
=20
on the date which the CPUC determines that PG&E had in fact paid off its=20
stranded costs, a point groups such as TURN will surely protest.

It may seem surprising that TURN was among the group with PG&E that filed=
=20
the petition to lower the rate cap on wholesale prices. Typically, TURN=20
and PG&E (along with most utilities) are at polar opposites regarding most=
=20
issues. However, both agree that wholesale rates are too high and want=20
to see a new cap put into place, but for completely different reasons.=20
TURN says that PG&E and other utilities took a risk when agreeing to the=20
rate freeze and they should not be allowed to pass debts that resulted=20
from that risk onto customers. TURN continues to retain a watch over the=20
proceedings related to PG&E's proposal, specifically with regard to the=20
possibility that the CPUC will allow the utility to raise rates on customer=
s.

Within the course of these new developments, it's important to be clear=20
on PG&E's motivations. Some California lawmakers and consumer advocates=20
have called for a complete return to regulation, arguing that deregulation=
=20
in California has become a failed experiment. Many have surmised that PG&E'=
s=20
proposal for wholesale caps is essentially a call to return California=20
to a regulated structure. I think this is a misinterpretation. PG&E has=20
very clearly stated that its proposal is a "necessary short-term step to=20
try to bring prices back in line." PG&E's efforts really shouldn't be viewe=
d=20
as a move to return California to a regulated market. Rather, PG&E is merel=
y=20
attempting to protect its own interests. The utility wants to secure=20
temporary=20
lower rates for the power it needs to buy on the wholesale market and=20
transfer=20
its debts to customers once the rate freeze is lifted. A return to regulati=
on=20
via a permanent rate cap would not be in PG&E's best interests as it=20
continues=20
to sell power from its nuclear plant. In addition, PG&E probably recognizes=
=20
that regulation would discourage additional companies from building new=20
power plants in California, which would not be good for the long-term econo=
my=20
of the state. This also would do little to lower wholesale prices in=20
California.=20
As we discovered this summer, the less supply, the higher the price for=20
power.=20

PG&E's proposal to lower rate caps on wholesale prices is, more than anythi=
ng=20
else, an attempt to protect itself from what it perceives as disastrous=20
economic impact if it is not able to transfer its debt to customers. A=20
recent Wall Street Journal report inferred that if wholesale prices continu=
e=20
to exceed what PG&E can charge customers, the utility could become=20
"technically=20
insolvent" sometime next year. It will be interesting to see if the CPUC=20
has the same perception when it evaluates PG&E's proposal later this month.=

		 Subject: Super Saturday, June 3, 2000

During our off-site at Columbia Lakes recently,  we identified areas in ENA 
where significant gaps exist that need filling at the Analyst and Associate 
level.  We have scheduled an off-cycle Super Saturday on June 3, 2000 and I 
would like your participation as an interviewer.  We will need approximately  
25-30 interviewers to fill approximately 30 Associate & Analyst positions.  I 
am counting on everyone making themselves available on the third to 
facilitate this priority action item.

Ted Bland will be forwarding information concerning the event to each of you 
early next week.  

Thank you for your participation.  

Dave

Why should we hold them harmless on environmental if they get their money

		 Subject: Fidelity update

Last week during the holidays, we made a lot of progress w/ Fidelity 
regarding their "take-out" from the Partnership at Dallas.  We exchanged 2 
drafts of a Letter Agreement which says ENA (or an affiliate) will buy their 
99% LP interest in Landfill Gas Investments, LP (LGI) on or before Jan 31, 
2001.  Included in our draft was a provision whereby the ENE Guaranty would 
be extinguished.  However, late yesterday Fidelity came back and said they're 
not willing to extinguish the Guaranty completely.  The way the deal w/ 
Fidelity will be structured, ENA will pay them the delta between the $5.2MM 
initial payment they made less the accrued tax credits on the date we close 
(est to be $300K+/-).  Fidelity wants 2 things:

protection in the event the IRS disallows/disqualifies the tax credits 
accrued (i.e., the $300K), and
protection against any environmental claims that may have occurred while they 
were a partner in LGI (June, 200 thru Jan, 2001).

There are 2 basic alternatives to consider:

replace the existing guaranty to LGI with a new guaranty to Fidelity with a 
specific cap on the tax credit amount ($300K+/-) and with the same 
environmental coverage (up to $5MM) as currently exists but restricting it to 
issues which occurred while they were a partner.  The probability of either 
ever being triggered is extremely remote.  Replacing the benefactor from LGI 
to Fidelity is significant for us because it eliminates future environmental 
exposure related to LGI as well as prevents potential future buyers of our LP 
interest from seeing that ENE once was willing to issue such a guaranty.
replace the existing guaranty with an indemnity from ENA which provides 
Fidelity with the same protection as alternative #1.  Per ENA accounting 
since the amount of exposure is limited to $5.3MM in aggregate, this would 
not be significant/material enough to be separately identified as a balance 
sheet item.

The problem we have is Fidelity has a Guaranty "in hand" and unless you give 
me approval to go back and structure our deal around them, we don't have any 
leverage to get them to release it.  They are willing to work with us on 
either of the 2 alternatives listed above.  This is the only remaining 
commercial issue left w/ Fidelity.

Please advise or call to discuss further.  Ext. 33212.  Thanks!

RANDY

Philippe,

I would like to speak to someone in your group who can help us on a specific 
request. We've been bogged down over here with commercial disputes, so I have 
not been able to keep up with your current organization. If Dan Bruce is 
still involved in assisting you, he would be great, or maybe there is someone 
else who can help. 

In our current dispute with the gov't, we are concerned about possibilities 
of raids by gov't to seize documents, files, etc. We are in the process of 
removing hard files from India, taking them to our attorneys' offices in 
London. However, I am very concerned about electronic files and e-mails and 
such related stuff that could also be seized. This is true of servers, 
desktops, laptops and other computer devices.

Who can I speak to to get some guidance about how we can very quickly remove 
these items from our systems and hardware here in India? My immediate concern 
is getting this stuff out of the country as soon as we can. Once out, I can 
worry about indexing and making available specific items upon request to 
people in India when they need it.

Thanks for your input.
Wade

Mark Powell's recollection of the reasoning behind having an all-Canadian 
officer and director slate is correct and we generally like to isolate all of 
the business decision makers of a foreign subsidiary in the country where the 
subsidiary is incorporated.  The concern is that having officers and 
directors located outside of the country of incorporation of the subsidiary 
could provide a basis for a country other than the one where the subsidiary 
is incorporated to assert taxing jurisdiction (the PE issue).  That said, I 
appreciate the control concern and so long as the authority of the 
non-Canadian Director is never exercised outside of Canada (of course, this 
presents a proof issue) having a non-Canadian Director is permissible (from a 
tax perspective, that is).  Let me know whether such a restriction would be 
compatible with the expressed control concern.  Steve. (x30938)

I don't think there is a bright line, so that should not be a problem per

A.  Corporate Structure - To facilitate the meshing of EES' existing Canadian 
affiliate (Enron Energy Services Canada Co. Ltd. ("EES Canada")) and Enron 
Canada Corp.'s mass market retail venture (Enron Direct Limited Partnership 
("Enron Direct Canada")), I propose a simple corporate structure as follows:

Enron Direct Canada's business will be set up as a subsidiary of EES Canada.  
This will involve:
a. a general conveyance of the assets of Enron Direct Canada to its general 
partner, Enron Direct Canada Corp.;
b. the sale of the shares of Enron Direct Canada Corp. from Enron Canada 
Corp. to EES Canada; and
c.  a services agreement whereby Enron Canada Corp. provides key services to 
Enron Direct Canada.

By setting up Enron Direct Canada as a distinct subsidiary of EES Canada, 
both entities will continue to operate as they do today.

As such, (i) Enron Direct Canada will continue to be operated by the staff 
currently in place in Calgary, but within the EES corporate structure, and 
(ii) EES Canada's existing business will continue to be operated as it is 
currently.

B.  Governance - I understand from Peter that a few years back, it was 
decided, for corporate law and, more importantly, tax-related "permanent 
establishment" issues, that all directors and officers of Enron Canada Corp. 
would be Canadian-resident employees of Enron Canada Corp.  Accordingly, 
Enron Canada Corp. was re-organized with a nominee board of directors now 
consisting of Rob (as the senior Canadian commercial employee) and Peter (as 
the senior Canadian legal employee) with officers being the Vice-Presidents 
or Managing Directors in Canada responsible for the various commercial or 
commercial-support groups. 

Following this model, Rob Milnthorp and an employee from the legal department 
would appear to be the appropriate directors of the EES' Canadian 
subsidiaries.  In the short term, the Iegal employee/designee would be me; 
however, the new lawyer hired to work for Enron Direct Canada would assume 
the role. 

With respect to the officers, no changes are required with respect to Enron 
Direct Canada.  With respect to EES Canada, I propose that Rob be appointed 
as the Chairman, President and CEO and I be appointed as Secretary for the 
interim.

Unless I hear otherwise, I will proceed on the basis of these proposals.

Regards,

Mark Powell

Rappaport's comments are potentially very negative to us.  I think we should 
write him a letter in protest.    Mark

Bob:

We are working on an e-signature "protocol" and wondered if ISDA wanted to 
take the lead in this matter?  Let me know.

Mark:

Pursuant to our discussion last week, below is a rough draft of a proposal 
for an electronic signature protocol, which could be presented to ISDA for 
further consideration and discussion after we have further discussed:

E-Signature Protocol

Objective: In light of the enactment of the US federal legislation on 
electronic signatures (effective as of 10/1/00), a simple, reliable, and 
enforceable protocol should be established to facilitate the electronic 
execution of Master Agreements (and confirmations where required).  To 
facilitate the wider use of electronic contracts, this protocol could be 
endorsed by ISDA. Hopefully, it would become a standard that others would use 
for all types of contracts. Perhaps, if necessary or helpful, the adoption of 
the protocol could be done electronically by each party unilaterally agreeing 
to abide by it, possibly using the same type of approach ISDA used in 
connection with the introduction of the EMU currency a few years ago.  
Initially, the protocol would be primarily applicable to U.S. counterparties, 
but it could be expanded to non-U.S. counterparties as e-signature laws like 
the new U.S. law are enacted across the globe.

Basic Protocol:  By adopting the protocol, each counterparty would agree that 
the relevant agreement may be electronically signed by complying with the 
following steps:

1) The parties negotiate and agree on a final form the relevant agreement, 
and appoint one of the parties ("First Party") to prepare the document for 
electronic signature;

2) The First Party prepares the final form in the PDF format (e.g., the body 
of the text could not be modified) with the exception of the blank signature 
blocks for each party to be placed on the last page of the agreement;

3) An authorized signatory of the First Party electronically signs the 
agreement (Note: this electronic signature could be accomplished by 
inscribing an electronic handwritten signature or the signatory typing in 
his/her name and title in the blank signature block);

4) The agreement, as electronically signed by the First Party, is sent via 
electronic means (e.g., by e-mail) by the First Party to the other party 
("Second Party");

5) An authorized signatory of the Second Party  electronically signs the 
agreement (Note: this electronic signature could be accomplished by 
impressing an electronic handwritten signature or the signatory typing in 
his/her name and title in the signature block);

6) The agreement, as electronically signed by the Second Party, is sent via 
electronic means (e.g., by e-mail) by the Second Party to the First Party, 
accordingly, creating the fully executed agreement; and

7) Each party would be responsible for maintaining in its own electronic 
archives the agreement as electronically signed by the parties.

Also, the following could be considered: (a) adding to the protocol that each 
party,by adopting the protocol, agrees to be bound by any agreement entered 
into by means of the protocol, and any other appropriate language to enhance 
the enforceability of the "e-signature" process and (b) adding to the 
preprinted form of the Master Agreement, a provision whereby each party 
adopts the electronic signature protocol endorsed by ISDA as in effect from 
time to time.

Mark, I would be happy to discuss this draft proposal with you further at 
your convenience.



Regards, Alan

Mark:

As you may recall, I interviewed with you in the fall of 1997.  I ended up
accepting an offer from Koch before going through the last round of
interviews (4th)  with Enron.

Over the past 2+ years, I have been the only power attorney at Koch.  Among
other functions, I have supported the power trading operations, the power
project development operations, and Koch's retail power accounts.  The work
has been challenging, exhilarating and at times overwhelming from a work
load perspective.  I truly love my job.  While I cannot complain about the
job experience, Koch as a company leaves much to be desired.

I would love to work for such an innovative company as Enron; your company
sets the standard in our industry.  I would love to talk to you about any
potential employment opportunities with Enron.  Please contact me if you
think I could bring value to you and Enron.

Sincerely,

Tim Beverick, Attorney

Based on earlier conversations, I have identified the following business 
methods that may be novel from a patent point of view:

1.   our site is offering "prime" paper rather than seconds or ends
2.   credit risk is managed by the site (credit intermediation) without cost 
to customers
3.   customers can access financial derivatives on paper to manage price risk 
on physical paper products
4.   customers have access to financial derivatives to manage price risk on 
prime offerings

Please give me your comments on this so we plan our strategy.

Mark:

It never fails.  Ironically, within an hour after hitting the "Send" button 
on my prior e-mail to you, I got a call from Stephanie, Jim's assistant, 
informing me that Jim's travel schedule for the first week in September had 
changed since I had set up the appointment and so we are going to have to 
reschedule the meeting with him.  Stephanie gave me a couple of possible 
dates in late Sept. and the middle of October that I need to follow up with 
Steve and Peter on.  Once I circle back with them, I'll follow up with you to 
see what may work for you.

Since I am scheduled to have a meeting in your offices on the morning of the 
7th, I still plan to be in Houston.  Is there a chance that you and I could 
get together for lunch on the 6th or perhaps catch up for a few minutes that 
afternoon or the afternoon of the 7th?

I'll touch base with you to see what your schedule looks like.  Thanks.  John

John Nowlan wants to enter into a Confidentiality Agreement with Eastman 
Chemical Company in connection with discussions concerning the potential 
joint development of an internet portal.  Eastman wants Enron to agree to a 
nonsolicitation provision that would prohibit us for a period of 12 months 
from initiating hiring contacts with Eastman employees identified in a 
schedule to be attached to the Confidentiality Agreement.  Contacts with us 
initiated by Eastman employees as well as responses by Eastman employees to 
general employment advertisements would be excluded from the nonsolicitation 
provision.  John takes no exception to the nonsolicitation provision.  Under 
our Legal Department Guidelines I need your approval to go forward with this 
arrangement.  Please let me know if you approve.
Thank you for your assistance.

Mark,

Enron Europe's experience is that there is some resistance to ISDA 
documentation in most of the European countries in which we are active. Our 
list of countries which we feel would benefit from promotional sessions 
arranged by ISDA is as follows. The countries are in order ranked by Enron 
Europe's view of the significance of the market in each country and where 
ISDA resistance is strongest. Most significant market and most resistance 
ranked at the top of the list for both Europe and the Far East: 

Europe
Germany
Switzerland
Austria
Spain
Nordic countries: Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland
Netherlands
Italy
France
Poland
Czech Republic
Hungary

Far East
Singapore
Japan
Hong Kong


Thanks

A concern has been raised about IT service providers working on EOL or other 
Enron projects and then taking know-how to a competitor, such as Dynegy.
Since these service providers tend to work for a lot of different companies, 
it seems like this is a significant issue.  How do we address this risk in 
the contracts?
Do we need to add a non-competition clause?

The 9th Circuit of the U.S. Ct. of Appeals granted EES' request to stay an 
injunction granted by the District Court in the UCS litigation, which would 
have required EES to continue to directly serve UCS.  The stay allows EES to 
return the customer UCS to PG&E and SCE for utility service and thereby save 
the future accrual of an additional $144 million of negative CTC 
receivables.  In approximately two months, the 9th Circuit will conduct a 
further review of the stay, at which point the litigation will return to the 
District Court for discovery and eventually trial.

view on how much.  Mark

Mark,

I was chatting with HR rep in Calgary and she mentioned in doing the new 
contract on Gaffney it brings him very close to Keohane and possibly we might 
look to do something for him also?

What are your views?

I am working on a plan to increase our bench strength in trading.  Wtih 
bandwidth, EOL etc., I think recruiting additional lawyers to do trading 
legal work is critical.  I will give you and Michael a call over the next 
week or so.  

Take care.

Greg Piper raised the following questions:

Is ENW a marketing affiliate?
Is EOL a marketing affiliate?
Sally Beck's organization?
Can Beck's organization process transactions for CMS pipelines?
Could Sally use ETS resources to do processing for CMS?

Greg is looking for some guidance by Tuesday.  Let's discuss.

		 Subject: Commodity / Embedded Finance Deals

Tim, I would argue that we should pursue this business as long as a) we are 
being adequately compensated for the financing and underlying commodity risk; 
b) we have very good paper; c) we are dealing with solid credits and are 
charging an appropriate risk adjusted cost of capital for the underlying 
financing; d) we have the ability to syndicate the capital or funds flow 
position if needed to manage cash issues and e) that RAC is comfortable that 
we are reaching these goals.

Any imbedded financing or $5M or more should be DASHED.  David, Joe and Mark 
should be your key contacts to ensure we are adequately managing these issues 
but I do not see any fatal flaw in the strategy if priced/managed well and we 
watch the funds flow issues.  

Regards
Delainey

We have closed the following deals where we deliver power two a muni in the 
short term and get paid back power later on.  These deals have both a 
commodity and a finance portion:

Counterparty    Loan Period  Repayment Period  Amount Financed

Grant County    7/01 to 7/06   7/06   $4.7 million
Grant County    5/01 to 7/06   7/06   $5.7 million
Avista/Kaiser    7/2000   7/2000 to 7/2006   $31.3 million   
BPA/Kaiser    9/2000   7/2001 to 9/2001   $36 million
Clatskanie    11/2000 to 9/2001 10/2001 to 9/2006  $5 million
Eugene Water and Electric  1/2001 to 3/2002  11/2001 to 4/2002  $4.9 million
Eugene Water and Electric  7/2001 to 12/2002 5/2002 to 12/2002  $7.3 million

We are seeing demand for more of these.  For example, Tacoma City Light is 
looking at $35,000,000 + in this type of structure.  What do you guys need to 
know about this business and how much of an appetite do we have for this?

Mr. Haedicke,

I'm a new hire and was recently advised to become familiar with the NYMEX.com 
website.  While I was there, I looked up Enron under NYMEX.com's "member 
firms" section.  I found Enron's name and your name as a contact point.  What 
was odd though was that although your email address appears correctly as a 
hyperlink ("mhaedic@ect.enron.com"), I noticed that the actual email 
reference was to someone at El Paso Energy, "morrissont@epenergy.com".  You 
can see this by right-clicking on the hyperlink and looking at the link's 
properties.   I believe this will cause emails intended for you to go to El 
Paso Energy.

I don't know how often this link would even be used so this may not be a big 
deal...

If you have any questions I may be reached at extension 53707.

Hal

		 Subject: Enron Corp. Parental Guarantees

Lavo/Mark, although it has been a chronic problem, the seemingly inexcusable 
delay at processing guarantees by Enron Corp. (both Enron Corp. and 
Counterparty) seems to be getting worse of late.  It is becoming an 
impediment to transacting and to our reputation in the market as the largest 
and most responsive energy marketer.  As you know, our business is 
essentially transacted off Enron Corp.'s credit, and procuring guarantees is 
often unnecessarily difficult and time consuming.  I know that Commercial, 
Credit and Legal are all frustrated by the process.  I know Bill is seeing if 
there is something he can do, but I was wondering whether there was also 
something you could do to speak to this issue in Houston.

Peter.

Mark - Could we arrange a telephone call with you, Mary and me this week to
discuss the North America Energy Derivatives Committee and a proposed agenda
for the near term - including the conference in Houston that you've been
discussing with Mary?  There has been no meeting for some time as you know.
Regards, Ruth

Mark:

Thanks a lot for the lists.  If it's ok with you I will get back to you on
getting some contact names.

We are looking into hotels in Houston for the Energy conference in February
or March, 2001.  Is there any certain time in those months that wouldn't
work for you?  Houston is becoming a very difficult place to find hotel
availability.  The thinking was to hold an Energy conference in the U.S. in
the first half and in the U.K. sometime in the second half of the year.  It
has been mentioned that we should hold the Europe Energy conference in
Amsterdam.  My thinking is that we should first hold it in London.  What do
you think?

Regards,
Mary

Mary:

I asked for a list of major energy trading parties.  It seems to me that we
should try again to get those on the list that are not already members to
join
ISDA.  Let me know if I can help.

list
is as follows:

          2.  Aquila
          3.  Coral
          4.  Duke Energy Trading
          5.  El Paso Merchant Energy

          8.  Reliant

business?  What if it no longer physically handles a particular commodity?

Subject: Quinn Emanuel Urquhart

At Sean's request I had lunch today with Bill Urquhart and Lamont Jones, who 
are with Quinn Emanuel in L.A.  Quinn Emanuel is a litigation firm of 
approximately 100 attorneys based in L..A.  Their client list and litigation 
record are impressive.  From what I have read and heard, they strike me as 
the "Susman Godfrey" of L.A. (and could be even better).    Bill worked with 
Jonathan Sumption on an arbitration, they became friends, and now whenever 
Bill is in London he stays in Sumption's home.  I think we should keep the 
firm in mind for California litigation and international arbitrations.

This NDA is with Enron Corp. and EBS is not permitted to bind Enron Corp.  
The legal department would like for all potential clients to review our form 
for execution.  If they present their own form we are happy to review it, 
however there is almost always terms of their form that need to be 
negotiated.  Therefore, if they review our form NDA and it is acceptable the 
process is a lot quicker.  

Attached is the NDA with EBS and C-Store Matrix to send to them for 
execution.   Please select the "Read Only" option in order to open and 
print.  Please print 2 originals for signature so each party has an original 
executed NDA, or you may e-mail it to them as long as they follow up with 2 
originals.  After the other party executes it, you will need to get an EBS 
attorney to initial it before an EBS VP or above can execute it on our 
behalf.  If you have any questions please call me and please make sure I get 
an executed original back.  Thanks.

Here is a copy of the NDA for C-StoreMatrix.  I am not sure if this has

John:

I will get on your calender in January when I am over.  It is also my 
understanding, for the credit trading business you are developing, that 
Chinese walls are not necessary.  But it will be necesary to address if 
equity trading starts up.  Also, there are probably related issues, like 
restricted lists and the like, that could apply to credit trading.  Hope you 
have time to enjoy the Holidays.  Take care.

Hi Mark, 

I'm still waiting to hear back from the President of Western Union. I met 
with the company psychologist last Wednesday and she said that she thought I 
would be offered a position within a few days. The long wait game wears on 
you after a while. 

We were talking about coming up to Breckinridge to ski with you one day, 
perhaps Christmas. What day do you arrive and when do you leave. 

Have a great day. 

Larry

		 Subject: FCEL

Guys, I have spoken to Cliff and Mark and we are comfortable moving forward 
under the structure we have discussed.

 FCEL: - $5MM in equity and 1.3MM warrants from corporate treasury stock that 
vest based upon 60MW of orders;
  - discussion with FCEL in which we disclose ALL infromation we have about 
the potential Conn. deal - I will require that myself and Mark be on   that 
call;
  - the transaction is fully press released immediately.

 CRRA: - subject to final due diligence on the development risks, we provide 
the management and wrap for CRRA on the potential fuel cell development   
opportunity that consists of between 25 and 50 MW;
  - any appropriation of funds from the government will require DPUC hearing 
at which we will fully disclose in a factual manner our interest in    FCEL.

I will require that Mark Haedicke manage this process and sign off on all 
press releases, term sheets, disclosure discussions, contracts and regulatory 
filings.  I believe that we have this managed appropriately as long as we 
manage the process as per the script and in a factual manner.

Thanks
Delainey

Gary

There follows a summary of the key information required in order to be able 
to estimate, under SFA capital rules, the likely regulatory capital 
requirements of the proposed bond and equity trading businesses in London.  
The summary has been prepared by Andy Cornfield who is our resident expert on 
the SFA's capital rules.

As previously discussed, EEFT - our SFA regulated agent through which we 
currently propose to run this business - is subject only to very modest 
regulatory capital rules since it does not take any principal positions.  Our 
view, however, is that a bond and equity trading desk of the type discussed 
will (sooner or later) become subject to SFA capital requirements and so it 
makes sense now to estimate the likely extent of that capital.

It would be very helpful at this stage if you (or someone in your group) 
could provide a guestimate (based on the US model, but modified where you 
think the European positions might be different) of the likely volumes and 
constituent parts of these businesses:

after 12 months of trading 
after 24 months of trading
after 36 months of trading

Please contact Andy or myself if you would like to discuss this. I look 
forward to hearing from you.

Best regards

Paul

updated dealflow summaries so we can ensure that (1) legal coverage is being 
provided for the relevant transactions and (2) there is agreement that the 
"right" lawyers (both inside and outside) are being engaged.

Please feel free to distribute, as needed.  I previously provided Travis with

Let me know if you are ok with the following memo which would come from you 
and me to  the traders and senior originators:



Effective October 15, 2000, the retention period on tape recordings of trades 
done by telephone will be reduced from four months to one month.  The tapes 
regarding significant transactions may be retained for such longer period as 
approved in writing by both the Head Trader and the General Counsel.  Please 
propose those significant transactions on which you may wish to retain the 
tapes, prior to October 15, 2000, since the tapes on conversations older than 
one month will be destroyed on that date.  If you have any questions, please 
contact Mark Haedicke or Richard Sanders. 


We are still looking at moving to recording only the deal terms -- but that 
is a long term project.

		 Subject: Change to standard ISDA Schedule

Dear All,

In the course of current ISDA Master Agreement negotiations with an 
Australian counterparty it has come to my attention that the ISDA netting 
opinion for Australia specifies that certain Sections of the ISDA Master 
should not be altered; otherwise reliance on the opinion, and close-out 
netting, could be jeopardised.  In particular the opinion specifies that 
Section 2(a)(iii) should not be altered.  

Enron has a standard alteration to Section 2(a)(iii) in Part 5 of its 
standard form Schedule, viz.  

"(a) Conditions Precedent.  The condition precedent set forth in clause (1) 
of Section 2(a)(iii) shall not apply to payments owed by a party if the other 
party shall have satisfied in full all its payment obligations under Section 
2(a)(i) and shall at the relevant time have no future payment obligations 
whether absolute or contingent, under Section 2(a)(i)."

Obviously, in the case of Australian counterparties this condition precedent 
should not be included in our documentation.

In addition, there are a number of other countries (including Germany, Italy, 
South Korea and Switzerland) where the effectiveness of the ISDA netting 
opinion presupposes that certain Sections of the Master, including Section 
2(a)(iii), are not altered in any material respect. To that end I would 
suggest that our standard condition precedent does make a material alteration 
and that it should not be included in ISDA Master Agreements with 
counterparties trading from these jurisdictions.

Certainly from the London end, I think that when we start negotiations with a 
new counterparty we should check the ISDA opinions to ensure that we don't 
trip ourselves up.

Regards, 

Edmund

Enron Japan is also planning an energy conference in April / May of next year 
to promote our energy business here in Japan.  The arrangements are still 
very much at the preliminary stage so are confidential which is why I did not

We are pleased to announce organizational changes to the Enron South America 
legal department in response to the recent reorganization and realignment of 
the principal Enron Wholesale Services business units operating in the 
region, Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets. 

Randy Young, currently General Counsel of ESA, will be assuming new 
responsibilities within Enron.  John Novak will become General Counsel of 
ESA, reporting to Mark Haedicke.  The ESA legal department will be 
responsible for supporting all Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets 
businesses in the region.  Additional legal resources, coordinated by Lance 
Schuler, will be provided from EWS Legal in Houston to support ESA's 
wholesale activities.  John will also work closely with Bruce Lundstrom, 
General Counsel of EGA, to coordinate legal support with respect to the EGA 
businesses in the region.  An organizational chart describing the new 
structure is attached.

This new structure will enable us to continue to provide quality legal 
support across business lines within South America while improving 
coordination and providing additional support from Houston for Enron's 
existing operating businesses, as well as the new business development 
initiatives under way in the region.

		 Subject: New Canadian Lawyer

Janette - Can you call Sharon to co-ordinate 5-10 minutes when Mark is 
available to discuss the attached.

Mark -  I want to discuss with you a candidate, with the following background 
information.  Sorry for the long memo but it might make our discussion more 
efficient.

I wanted to see if I could recruit someone with 4-6 years major law firm 
experience and whom I knew or could confirm by my contacts as having a 
reputation as a quality lawyer and person with broad corporate and commercial 
experience.  Perhaps I am getting too far removed from that level, but I was 
able to come up with only one candidate that I think is worthy of pursuing.  
If he proves unsatisfactory, I will then have to go to an 
out-placement/recruitment agency, which is relatively expensive.  That said 
the candidate I am suggesting would to my mind be as good or better than any 
candidate that we may find through a formal recruitment process.  His name is 
Derek Flaman.  I will send his resume to you by fax.

A couple of points:

Strengths:

(a)  Derek comes from the Donahue Ernst and Young firm and to my knowledge is 
a highly regarded commercial associate.

(b)  Prior to that he was at Macleod Dixon and a highly regarded commercial 
associate there.  The Managing Partner of Donahue Ernst and Young Calgary 
came from Macleod Dixon Calgary and brought Derek over with him.

(c)  Derek has never done any work for us, but I have met him socially a 
number of times and have spoken to him about this job possibility.  I think 
he has a down-to-earth and comfortable personality that would suit the 
atmosphere and stresses of Enron well.

(d)  Derek was seconded internally to Husky Oil - one of DEY's major Calgary 
clients - for a period and has experince in-house.  He worked for an internal 
lawyer at Husky who is a friend of Greg Johnston and who gave excellent 
reviews.

(e)  Although I do not have his law school grades, he tells me he finished in 
the top third of his class at Queens University - which among the reputable 
schools in Canada.

(f)  He is qualified both under Alberta and Ontario law.

(g)  He has met with Milnthorp and Greg Johnston, both of whom were favorably 
impressed.

Issues:

(a)  Derek graduated from law school in '94 and since that time his career 
has been a bit traveled.  Although there is an explanation, his continuous 
experience at Macleod Dixon and Donahue Ernst and Young started in '97.  
Before that the history is he is from a small town in Alberta.  After 
graduating he wanted to work at a small firm in Toronto and had an interest 
in labor law, and spent his first year articling to a Toronto labor 
boutique.  After that year he wanted to get into commercial work and out 
Toronto, and moved to Fraser Milner in Edmonton.  His wife then took a 
position at Stikeman Elliott in Calgary however, and so he moved to Macleod 
Dixon in Calgary.  He moved to Donahue Ernst and Young when they established 
their office in Calgary.  All things being considered, I am comfortable with 
his experience at say a 4 to 5 year level - although compensation could then 
be an issue (I have not discussed compensation with him).

(b)  Derek's experience has been primarily in large commercial projects, 
especially the off-shore oil and gas developments in Hibernia and Terra Nova 
for Husky.  This would require some very good legal and large project 
organizational skills but is obviously different from a faster paced, 
commercially oriented, higher volume trading atmosphere.  In his secondment 
to Husky however he was more involved in their retail gasoline business and 
natural gas marketing and,  although I am sure not the atmosphere at Enron, 
he tells me it is an atmosphere he is comfortable with and enjoys.

(c)  Do Jim Derrick's accounting/law firm concerns apply to hiring a lawyer 
(as opposed to retaining counse)?

I would like to get back to Derek soon to discuss next steps (interview in 
Houston? with whom? Vicki Sharp? get a feel for compensation expectations?), 
or look to other alternatives.

Peter.

		 Subject: BEAR

Cindy and Mark:  The Community Relations team has brainstormed ways to 
support BEAR during the holiday season, specifically with their bike drive.  
One note,  Enron already adopts an entire needy Elementary School for the 
holiday seaso, and our employees adopt each child in the school by donating 
money, etc. to provide supplies and clothing for the children, so I am a bit 
concerned about another big employee drive during the holidays.  

However, we have a number of ideas that I will share below, knowing that it 
may take some time to schedule a meeting for the three of us:

1.  Partner with 104 KRBE to promote a Bike Drive in partnership with Sun & 
Ski Sports (one of KRBE's sponsors).  Enron could pay for the advertising 
dollars and Sun & Ski could get shoppers to make donations toward buying 
bikes.  Laura Schwartz is exploring KRBE's appetite for something like this.

2.  BEAR/CPS table at our December 1 Big E Cafe which highlights ways for 
employees can get involved throughout the community during the holidays.  
BEAR could use the opportunity to ask for donations as well as offer 
volunteer opportunities.

3.  Partner with the Enron Cycling Club to donate bikes - leverage their 
connections with local bike stores.  These employees might be more likely to 
want to donate.

2.  Utilize Matching Dollars (up to $15,000 per employee annually) if Mark or 
other employees are interested in contributing.  Additionally, if Mark or 
other employees volunteer with BEAR, using VIP dollars (up to $2500) to pay 
for bikes.

Please let me know your thoughts, so that we can pursue some of these 
opportunities.  

Elyse

Michael:

I think it is an excellent idea to keep count of the number of ISDAs we have 
as a way of focusing attention on our progress.  I think it may be a good 
idea to get a paralegal secondee from A&O or Linklaiters.  That secondee 
could then help with overflow work after a return to the firm.

I am ok with your slate, but need some Houston people on board as well.  I 
think we can shorten the Houston list by taking me off since John Novak will 
be on the board.  I leave it to Bruce to see if it makes sense to shorten the

Did you  get a chance to review the Elektro board make up.  I would like to 
finalize before the next ordinary shareholder meeting in Brazil.   Thanks

---------------
See attached regarding Elektro's board membership.  We would suggest that the 
board slate be made up of Brazil residents in order to facilitate the 
necessary meetings. I would like to include Joe Kishkill, John Novak, Brett 
Wiggs, Britaldo Soares and Joao Carlos Albuquerque, all members of our 
executive committee to substitute Rick Waddell, Diomedes, Jim Bannantine, and 
Rick Lammers.  If  you agree, I will talk to Rebecca to finalize.  Thanks

Subject: Enron Global Assets Board Slates

Folks -

The Legal Specialists in EGA are working up new director/officer slates for 
the EGA entities.  We will be appointing the following list of directors for 
EGA entities:  

Rebecca McDonald
Jim Hughes
Jeff Sommers
Jim Derrick
Mark Haedicke

There will be some exceptions to this slate, particularly where local law or 
the necessity of regular board attendance requires additional (or even 
different) directors to be appointed.  These will be considered on a 
case-by-case basis.  Allow the Legal Specialists the opportunity to come up 
with their tentative slates and then we will give them to the regional heads 
for comment.

Some of you will be asked to resign your current directorships.  I hope that 
no one will take offense to the fact of of the changed slates -- none is 
intended.  We have found that this common slate has made corporate governance 
more efficient and less complicated.

Thank you for your cooperation.  Please pass this message along to others in 
your respective groups as you deem necessary.

Bruce

To be elected as a Board member a person must be a shareholder of the Company 
(normally one share is transferred to such member) and tehre is no more the 
requirement of the Brazilian residency.
There is no other mandatory requirements.
However one has to have in mind that from a practical point of view it  is 
not viable to have only non residents at the Board (frequent trips to Brazil, 
less flexibility on timing to pass resolutions about ugent matters etc)  
Ideally at least trhee shoul be resident in Brazil (present minum quorum to 
held a Board Meeting.)

Vasco   What are the residency requirements for board membership?  Are
there other specific requirements?  I would like to send a proposal this
week. Thanks

Subject:  Board Members


Orlando:
As per your request, please find bellow the names of all of the present
members of Elektro's Board.
Firstly is to be mentioned that according to Elektro's By Laws, the Board may 
have a minimum of 4 and a
maximum of 7 permanent members (one obligatorily must be elected by
appointment of Elektros' employees) and a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 4
alternates (one obligatorily to act solely as alternate to the employees'
representative at the Board)

Permanent members:
Diomedes Christodoulou (President)
Orlando Goanz?lez
Ricky Linn Waddell
Geraldo Gon?alves Pereira (elected by appointment of Elektro's employees)
Vacant (3)
Alternate members:
James Martin Bannantine
Richard Allan Lammers
Ricardo Louren?o Carneiro (alternate to Geraldo Gon?alves)
Vacant (3)

The election and/or dismissal of the Board members has to be decided by the
shareholders of the company.
Normally the election o the Board members takes place at the annual
Ordinary Shareholder's meeting. (This year, our OGM is scheduled to take
place on April, 29th.)
However this matter  can also be decided at any time via an Extraordinary
Shareholder's Meeting  that has to be called trough a  Board Resolution
that  has to be publicized at the Official Gazette no later than 8 days
prior to date of such EGM.
Should the present number of the Board members be maintained (i.e 4
permanent and 3 alternates), the election of new members (from our side)
will have to be made upon the resignation of those presently on seat.
Should you deem necessary, please call me at your earliest convenience.
Least but nol east As I vave mentined to you the other day, it is quite 
normal to appoint the senior legal council as an alternate to the permanent 
members of the Board so that he may legally be present at all the board 
meetings

(1) I presume references to the "ENA Legal Department" should remain as such 
and not be changed to the "Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department."  fyi, 
in the revised policy, ENA remains as a defined entity in that it is listed 
as a member of the "Group."yes

The Resource Group, as we last discussed it, is composed of the following: 
Dave Delainey, Mark Frevert, Julie Gomez, Steve Kean, John Lavorato, Mike 
McConnell, Michael L. Miller, Jeff Shankman, Rick Shapiro, John Sherriff and 
Greg Whalley.

(2) Should Jeff McMahon (CEO of Enron Industrial Markets) be added?yes

(3) Should Ray Bowen (COO of Enron Industrial Markets) be added?yes

(4) Should Louise Kitchen (CEO of Enron Net Works) be added?yes

Once the Resource Group is finalized and the policy is ready to go out, I 
will prepare for your review a very brief  memo (2 or 3 sentences) to each 
person on the group notifying them that they have been designated to the 
group per the new policy, which is revised to reflect the new Enron Wholesale 
Services structure.

Please reply with your thoughts.  Thanks -- Bob

We were unable to convince Morgan Stanley's counsel to provide the Affidavit 
in support of our position by the noon deadline today.  He said that although 
the traders were OK, he needed to track down internal approvals over the next 
few days.  Notwithstanding the deadline, it would still be extremely helpful 
to our case if we received the Affidavit over the next couple of days.  We 
would file the Affidavit, and deal with the judge, hopefully convincing him 
to allow the Affidavit notwithstanding the deadlines he established (there is 
a good likelihood he would do so).  As mentioned it would be very helpful if 
we weren't the only party advocating the need for a comprehensive index 
before the judge.  Accordingly, if you have any residual pressure to bear on 
MS, it would be greatly appreciated.

Peter.

I am copying Frank Sayre and Mark Haedicke on this memo because I understand 
that responsibilty  for this project is now somewhere between you two gents 
and therefore you both need a heads up. Vicki, you also need to be aware of 
this as well.

I attach a letter EECC signed and sent out to the EcoElectrica project 
yesterday re the need to schedule a senior management meeting to try and 
resolve outstanding issues and payments due EECC for this project, We have 
been trying to schedule meetings to resolve these matters since September, 
but the project, perhaps because of Mission Energy's impact, has not yet 
agreed to a meeting to resolve the matter.    

With David Haug's help  we were able to get a significant portion of 
undisputed payments that had been delinquent for some time (in some cases 
since before the first of the year) paid. including a recent payment of $6 
million. Even so, approximately $18 million still remains unpaid to EECC and 
seriously delinquent.  EcoElectrica has identified $8.4 million as being 
withheld in connection with disputed liquidated damage payments, but there 
remains an undisputed, unpaid balance of approximately $9.6 million that 
EcoElectrica has not offered any contractual or other explanation for 
withholding other than that  they are working on other matters.

Larry Izzo needs to get these claims resolved, and at least needs a 
commitment from EcoElectrica to a date for formal senior management 
discussions under the contract from the project. Failing that, he will be 
directing EECC to seek clearance to institute arbitration proceedings.

Alan,

Here's a good start on the list of the most likely of the telecom guys to be 
transacting under the Master (or who have already transacted).  With that, 
I'd say that ISDA should initially target this group in its membership.  (You 
asked for 10, but I thought of 12 -- you can cut two if you like.)

GENUiTY
Broadwing
MCI WorldCom
Level (3)
Global Crossing
360networks
Touch America (Montana Power -- might already understand ISDA from power 
trading side)
Cable & Wireless
Universal Access
AT&T
Teleglobe
Qwest

Good to hear from you, and keep in touch!  Things are really moving up here, 
and we couldn't have done it without all your help and guidance.

Let me know if I can help with anything else.

Best regards,
Jay

Subject: DOM REP\SECLP

I am former counsel with Enron Caribbean Basin, which included supporting 
legal for the Dom REP: SECLP and the LNG project in development , and for 
Puerto Rico: Eco Electrica, Progasco and ProCaribe. As part of the Enron 
restructuring, I have been assigned to Enron Global Markets. 
 I understand that the SECLP asset  in the Dominican Republic has been 
assigned to your group. I am in the process of moving to the Enron building 
before year end and I have been told that my office will have very limited 
storage space. Please let me to know where to send the SECLP files.
I will be available to assist in the transitioning of this matter.   

Thanks,

Mark, I am concerned that although assistance has been previously (prior to 
the latest reorg) represented to Peggy as forthcoming, it has not yet 
arrived.  We left our QLMeeting without a definite plan.....as I recall, 
because we thought there might be an individual with one of the "disbanding 
units" available "in the near future.  I am concerned  (based on some very 
tenuous third hand information) that Peggy may already be looking 
elsewhere...........I have told her that finding help for the Mexico work was 
on the very top of our agenda.....I would like to be able to inform her of 
what exactly we are doing to handle this situation................can you let 
me know what the status is of the individual referred to above.

Many thanks

Mark,

Remembering that we missed each other in London, will you be at the AGM in
DC? If so, shall we get together briefly? I met Mark Evans from your team in
London recently and had a useful chat about the state of the relationship
between CC and Enron. I also know that David Yeres from our NY office met
with you some time back in Houston. He will also be at the AGM and would, I
know, like to follow up on that meeting.

Best regards.

Mark

Dear All

Kathleen and I are getting married on 17 March 2001. Kathleen has had the 
pleasure of meeting those of you who were in Singapore in the last year and a 
half. As for the rest, I've told her so much about all of you that she feels 
she has met you!

Nony has been so kind to help us distribute our wedding invitations to you. I 
know its probably too far to come, but we really wanted  to somehow share the 
occasion with you, our friends in Houston. If you do happen to be in the 
neighbourhood and manage to come, we would be truly honoured.

Best regards
Matt

This is way too much of a commercial!  Two thirds of it speaks only to 
Kiodex.  Tell him that at least one-half should not be a commercial.  He said 
he was going to discuss new commodities and slant his presentation torward 
new commodities.  He needs to do more.

Hi Mark, 
Sami Arap, John Novak & I are in the process of developing a new matrix for 
arbitration in Brazil on certain types of trading contracts for your 
approval.   Until that is complete, however, Sami & John have identified the 
following spot market contracts as needing immediate approval for dispute 
resolution clauses agreeing to ICC administered arbitration in Sao Paulo or 
Rio.  As you are aware, this is somewhat contrary to our traditional policy 
for out of country ICC arbitration.  The counter parties in these 
transactions will not agree to arbitration outside Brazil.  Given the nature 
of these contracts, I believe ICC administered arbitration in Brazil is an 
acceptable means for dispute resolution.  I've discussed this with Rob and he 
is in agreement subject to your approval.
Regards,
Michelle

Subject: arbitration for Brazilian PPAs
Importance: High

Michelle;

Our commercial guys are negotiating a number of PPAs in Brazil (spot market 
deals) and we need to close these deals before the Brazilian Wholesale Power 
Market (MAE) starts accounting and settling the long & short differences 
among all players (LDC's, Genco's, marketers etc).  There are deals which 
were "closed" last year ("closing" meaning that price, MWh volume, term, 
power profile, center of gravity etc were agreed upon between the contracting 
entities).  Some of these MWh's have already been physically traded but MAE 
haven't yet calculated the system's settlement.

Karla and I are currently working on the below listed deals:

Moema-2: 10-year PPA to purchase 8MW; PV of apprx US$5,130,000.; MTM value of 
US$1,200,000.
Sgu?rio: 2-year PPA to purchase 0.5MW; TBD
Furnas Collar: 2-year PPA to purchase 20-90-130MW (collar concept); PV of 
apprx US$37,696,000.; MTM value of US$12,534,000.
Cofepar: 15-year term to purchase 200MW; PV of apprx US$171,014,000.; MTM to 
be defined.
CSN: 14-month PPA to purchase 13.4MW (10,000MWh/month); PV of apprx 
US$5,865,000.; MTM value of US$786,000.
Eletropaulo Metropolitana: 60-day PPA to purchase 7,000MWh/month; TBD
Gerasul/Pactual: 24-month PPA to purchase 29,57MW; PV of apprx 
US$19,096,000.; MTM value of US$4,235,000.
CEMAT/Pactual: 13-month PPA to purchase 46MW; PV of apprx US$12,201,000.; MTM 
value of 6,107,000.
Celtins: 30-day PPA to sell 80MWh during peak hours; TBD
Cemat: 30-day PPA to sell 950MWh during off-peak hours; TBD
SINOP:  10-month PPA to purchase 8MW; PV of apprx US$8,850,000; MTM value of 
US$1,723,000.
AES Sul:  4-month PPA to purchase 33,6MW; PV of apprx US$2,470,000.; MTM 
value of US$866,000.

We are not (yet) working under "umbrella" type of agreements where Enron and 
the counterparty will execute a General Terms and Conditions (GTC) with 
several Annexes, each of them related to a specific deal.  Each contract is 
to be treated as one single deal. 
Some of the above listed deals are 1QTR commercial priorities and I need to 
know if you would be OK with Enron's Marketing Co (ECE) using 
ICC-administered or FIESP-administered (as a second alternative) arbitration 
under ICC Rules in S?o Paulo as the PPA's dispute resolution mechanism.  
Although I am schedule to meet with Tozzini, Freire this week, I doubt I will 
have time to get their legal opinion, discuss it internally, prepare a 
recommendation to Jim Derrick etc etc.  I've already talked to some of the 
counterparty's in-house counsellors and none of them is willing to accept 
offshore arbitration.  Our counterparties' position has been arbitration in 
Brazil under int'l rules OR local courts.

 

Rgds,

Sami

during weeks when we don't have the all hands Legal Staff meeting.  The Legal 
Team meeting will be held every other Friday at 9:00 Houston time (currently 
12:00 noon S?o Paulo/Rio time) starting tomorrow.  The idea of the smaller 
group meeting is to get updates on the key deals/assets in the region so we 
can keep Houston current on a weekly basis when the larger legal staff 
meeting is not scheduled.  

While the group included on this call may change from time to time as deal 
priorities change, currently I would like to allocate reporting 
responsibility as follows:  Arap (key trading/origination deals); Watanabe 
(Eletrobolt); Vasco (Elektro); Porto (CEG/Gas Business Unit); Mendoza 
(Transredes sale process); and Novak (Cuiab?).

I look forward to speaking with you tomorrow.

Rgds,
 John

I have talked to Alan Aronowitz about this as well.  You need more resources 
immediately from inside.  We will also have to recruit outside to get enough 
resources as the business grows.

Mark,

I just wanted to send you a quick note regarding the LNG legal support.  As 
we discussed several weeks ago, I am concerned that within Dan Rodgers 
current group of resources there is no one with ECT commodity transaction 
experience.  This lack of experience is very noticeable to our commercial 
team as the current legal group is on a steep learning curve and given our 
immediate deal requirements.  Dan and I spoke about this yesterday and agreed 
that he will expedite the effort to recruiting someone from within ECT.   I 
believe not only will this person help enormously within our current deal 
flow but he/she would be a great resource for the other EGM legal team 
members regarding commodity transactions.  

The main reason for this note is to enlist your help to get the right person 
into the group.  I will routinely be checking with Dan as to the progress we 
are making on this effort.  

Thanks for your help in this effort.

Eric

it will calm down the traders in EWS.  I will keep you posted.

Here are my thoughts so far:

1.  Initial Legal Team -- Jeff Hodge, Jim Keller, Carol St. Clair, Aaron 
Rothwarg

2.  Spot Check the Forms -- over the next week

3.  Conform Forms to ENA Forms -- over next two months

4.  Develop Form Approval Process -- dual approvals by EES and ENA

5.  Develop Deal Approval Process -- deals above a certain size (or material 
variations from the form) would require concurrent EWS approval

6.  Request List of Major Contract Concerns from Traders -- items that cannot 
be hedged

		 Subject: Rockets Playoff Tickets - Response needed this week.

Mark and Rob:
 
Rockets have been looking good (despite the recent slump) and have a chance
to make the playoffs.  (I heard on the radio this morning that Hakeem may be
back.)  
 
So the Rockets have sent out invoices for playoff tickets.  We are supposed
to respond by this Friday, March 30.
 
This year (perhaps because they know there's a decent chance they won't make
the playoffs) the Rockets are invoicing playoff tickets in two installments.
The first installment covers rounds one and two, and the second covers the
Western Conference Finals and the NBA Championship.
 
I can't tell whether if you commit for the first two rounds you have a legal
obligation to buy the second and third if they make it to the Western
Conference Finals, but I assume that doesn't matter (we should assume that a
commitment now means a financial commitment for the entire playoffs).
 
Rounds 1 and 2 encompass 6 games.  $549 per seat, or $2,196 total.  That's
two games in Round 1 at $88.50 per ticket, and four games in Round 2 at
$93.00 per ticket.
 
Rounds 3 and 4 (which we wouldn't have to pay for until later) are $916 per
seat, or $3,664.  I assume that Rounds 3 and 4 will include 8 games.
 
For the regular season I had 6/44 of the tickets, which is 13.6%.  That's
approximately 1 ticket in Rounds 1 and 2 and 1 ticket in Rounds 3 and 4.
I'd be glad to spring for that, although if you all want all the playoff
tickets that's fine also.
 
So I suppose how much it's going to cost each of you depends on whether my
ticket is Round 1 or 2.  If it's in round 2 each of you would pay $912 for
the first two rounds, and if it's in round 1 each of you would pay $921.  If
the two of you want all the playoff tickets, each of you would pay $1,098
for Rounds 1 and 2.
 
This year the Rockets are saying that if the tickets are not used you can
ask for a refund by the same means that you paid.  So what I would propose
to do it put all the charges on my credit card and if they don't make the
playoffs that charge will be reversed; and it may not even make it on my
bill if they don't make the playoffs.
 
Since I will put it on my card I won't need your money until about the 20th
of April.
 
So please let me know if you want to commit and whether you want me to take
a ticket out of each of the sets of rounds. (I'm fine either way)

Wednesday, August 2.  Of course, I am available to discuss the draft as

Mark,  although I will hate to lose  Carlos and everyone here at EECC and 
NEPCO wants him to stay, in point of fact he has repaid his debt to society 
and is entitled to look at opportunites outside of EECC now. Please feel free 
to talk with him. He is discussing matters with Vicki et al now, and  she is 
aware that he will be contacting ENA (EWS?)as well.  

 As background, it was understood at the time we took Carlos on board that 
his long term career interests were not limited to our construction work, 
and, consistent with his resume, I have kept him mostly focused on our equity 
and finance related matters (including work-outs).  I do think well of 
Carlos, and certainly believe that he is a lawyer that Enron wants to keep.

Michelle, per my voicemail as I indicated, I am trying to pursue what 
opportunities may be available at EWS and both Julia Murray and Kay Mann 
recommended that I contact you.  As background, I have been at EECC since 
October last year where I have focused on traditional EPC contracts and joint 
venture agreements with construction partners, cross-border financing 
agreements principally in Mexico and merger and acquisition/strategic 
investment transactions.  Before coming to Enron, I worked with the Houston 
office of a New York based firm (Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle)  where 
I focused mostly on transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex on 
their transactions involving long and short term oil supply agreements and 
CFE (Mexico's electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and IPP 
projects.  Lastly, I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in 
Washington, DC where I focused on general domestic corporate transactions 
such as establishing new business entities (ie, joint venture work, 
partnerships etc.), m & a work, and securities offerings.  Thanks for your 
consideration and I look forward to talking with you when you return from 
vacation (my extension is 6-6127).

Mark:

As you know, we are going to start trading freight capacity this year.  We 
are building a team of Enron insiders and outsiders and I would like the sr. 
staff to understand how and why we insist on using our contractual concepts 
(e.g. make them look financial, limit liability, avoid litigation, etc.).  
Sean Cumerland (formerly CALME), Chris Kravas (CEO of WebModal) and I are 
going to meet February 7-9 at the Houstonian.  I am inviting you, Joe 
Deffner, Wes Coldwell, Vince Kaminski and Rick Buy to meet with us for an 
hour or so to communicate how your area integrates with the commercial 
businesses.  In addition, I think it will be helpful for you to hear about 
our plans to build the freight business.

Please let me know what time, if any, works for you on those days.

Thanks,

Dan Reck

Subject: MG Players - Roles and Facts

A quick brief on the key people I have met to date follows below.  Fiona, 
please pull together bios on each of Enron's team members and current job 
assignments at Enron and forward to Sid and John so they can know who they 
are dealing with - - - take a little of the mystery out of first 
engagements!  I will forward a hardcopy diagram of the Enron/MG plc 
Integration plan - - -

John Gill.  John's role as Assistant to the Executive is a senior commercial 
position.  He was recruited + hired by MG from GE Capital and has extensive 
experience in M+A activities.  He is assigned to MG's merchanting division 
and is a relatively recent hire.  I believe he has been actively involved in 
recruiting a 9 person structured finance team.  John, along with Sid Tipples 
and David Tregar, has been tasked to co-ordinate the Enron/MG integration.

Sid Tipples.  Like John Gill, Sid is an Assistant to the Executive working in 
the financial services division.  I've had limited conversation with him.  He 
is actively involved in corp development.

Howard Carter.  Howard is the Director of Finance in MCC.  He started his 
career at Anglo Chemical and Ore Co transferring to Philipp Bros when it 
acquired the majority holding in Anglo Chemicals.  He qualified as an 
accountant in 1979 and became a Fellow of the Chartered Association of 
Certified Accountants in 1984.  He joined MCC (physical merchanting division) 
when it was established in 1989.  He talked to me about a "control" function 
that his group performs that sounds somewhat like a combination of Enron's 
tasks for originators and structurers.  He seems to pick up several functions 
in the merchanting division and Michael Farmer is keen to keep him in the 
loop for H/R assessments.

David Tregar.  David is the Financial Director.  He was educated at Lancaster 
University prior to joining Arthur Andersen in 1973.  He became an associate 
of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in 1976 and  Fellow of the 
Institute in 1981.  Since leaving AA in 1978, he has worked continuously in 
commodity trading.  He joined MGAG in 1990 and was appointed Finance 
Director  of MGL in 1991.  Prior to this he worked for several US brokerage 
houses.  He is involved in just about everything at MG (risk, compliance, IT, 
treasury, banking).  Personally, David is very open and friendly.

Bernard Page.  Bernard is a long standing employee of MG (since early 1970s) 
due to retire in October.  He's had various positions of responsibilities.  
Prior to Enron's offer, he was winding down his career by planning MG's 
relocation from One America Square to 25 Cannon Street.  Now, it looks like 
he will be actively involved in relocating their offices to 40 G.  Bernard 
tends to be a little reticent until engaged in a conversation about MG's 
business, etc.  He has a solid understanding of the financial services 
division and an outstanding working knowledge of MG's office system 
infra-structure - - - if he doesn't know something, he knows where to get the 
answer.  I get the sense he has known Michael Hutchison for a long, long time.

Michael Farmer.  Michael is Managing Director of the merchanting division and 
has over 30 years experience in the metals industry.  He started his career 
with A Strauss & Co, a metal exchange broker and tin merchant.  He also 
worked for two other metal brokers and was formerly Desk Head (copper) for 
Philipp Brothers.  He jointly set up MCC, which is the (physical) merchanting 
division of MG, with Dieter Boettcher (Tom's father/uncle/relative???) who 
has subsequently retired.  Michael kindly explained the physical metals 
business to me and we immediately started connecting on commercial project 
development opportunities, particularly in copper.

Michael Hutchison.  Michael is the Managing Director of the financial 
services division.  He was educated at Hull University.  He joined MGL in 
1971, became a member of the Board of Directors in 1982, was appointed Joint 
Managing Director in 1984, and became Managing Director in 1995.  Between 
1984 and 1988, Michael was a committee member of the LME and from 1990 has 
served as a Director of the LME.  Michael is a very articulate, 
action-oriented trader, who just wants to get on with it.  Having said that, 
he has been very patient and careful in explaining the financial markets to 
me and has provided me with a lot of resources (videos, books, brochures, 
reports) on the industry.

Hamish Scutt.  Hamish was a banker with Kleinwort Benson for 18 years and 
developed a strong relationship with MG during the latter part, which led to 
him being recruited and hired ~3 years ago.  He is very interested in 
promoting a "credit culture" that proactively assigns  limits and measures 
performance.  I get the sense that he has, in his quiet and friendly way, 
pushed for more credit control in a productive fashion - - - he wants to 
avoid adversarial relationships with the metals traders.  He is very open to 
Enron's ideas about credit and is known by a number of people (Lee Munden, 
Steve Young) at Enron.

Tom McKeever.  Tom is the Executive Chairman and has been involved in the 
metals industry for over 22 years.  He joined MG in 1994 when he became 
responsible for the Group's US operations.  His experience with public 
companies (Amax) as a manager and director made him a very credible manager 
for MG during their IPO and period of public holding.  He lends stability and 
balance to the executive team.  He is very practical; for example, he wants 
to know who from Enron is going to contact MG staff - - - he doesn't want 
them, in their enthusiasm to be open with Enron, to reveal proprietary 
information to an unscrupulous competitor posing as Enron!

Tom Boettcher.  Tom joined MGAG in 1993 as a Vice President of the Metal 
Division, Head of Copper.  He became a Director of MCC in 1995.  Prior to 
joining MGAG he worked for 12 years as Head of Metal Department (Prokurist) 
at Norrdeutsche Affinerie.  I have only had limited discussion with Tom - - - 
he is preparing a list of development prospects based on a conversation I had 
with Michael Farmer.

Kevin Rhodes.  Kevin is the Director of Operations for the financial service 
division where he is responsible for the Administration department which 
encompasses all aspect of back-office and trader support systems.  He joined 
the Henry Bath (the warehousing company) from university and joined MGL when 
it took over Henry Bath in 1992.  I have not met Kevin, yet.

Timothy Jones.  Tim is the Director of Trading for the financial services 
division.  He joined MGL in 1980.  He was educated at Homefield College, 
Christchurch, and started with MGL as a trainee trader.  He has been MGL's 
Senior Trader for several years.  He was appointed a Director of MGL in 1995 
and is a member of the LME Ring Committee.  I have not met Tim, yet.

A.  Corporate Structure - To facilitate the meshing of EES' existing Canadian 
affiliate (Enron Energy Services Canada Co. Ltd. ("EES Canada")) and Enron 
Canada Corp.'s mass market retail venture (Enron Direct Limited Partnership 
("Enron Direct Canada")), I propose a simple corporate structure as follows:

Enron Direct Canada's business will be set up as a subsidiary of EES Canada.  
This will involve:
a. a general conveyance of the assets of Enron Direct Canada to its general 
partner, Enron Direct Canada Corp.;
b. the sale of the shares of Enron Direct Canada Corp. from Enron Canada 
Corp. to EES Canada; and
c.  a services agreement whereby Enron Canada Corp. provides key services to 
Enron Direct Canada.

By setting up Enron Direct Canada as a distinct subsidiary of EES Canada, 
both entities will continue to operate as they do today.

As such, (i) Enron Direct Canada will continue to be operated by the staff 
currently in place in Calgary, but within the EES corporate structure, and 
(ii) EES Canada's existing business will continue to be operated as it is 
currently.

B.  Governance - I understand from Peter that a few years back, it was 
decided, for corporate law and, more importantly, tax-related "permanent 
establishment" issues, that all directors and officers of Enron Canada Corp. 
would be Canadian-resident employees of Enron Canada Corp.  Accordingly, 
Enron Canada Corp. was re-organized with a nominee board of directors now 
consisting of Rob (as the senior Canadian commercial employee) and Peter (as 
the senior Canadian legal employee) with officers being the Vice-Presidents 
or Managing Directors in Canada responsible for the various commercial or 
commercial-support groups. 

Following this model, Rob Milnthorp and an employee from the legal department 
would appear to be the appropriate directors of the EES' Canadian 
subsidiaries.  In the short term, the Iegal employee/designee would be me; 
however, the new lawyer hired to work for Enron Direct Canada would assume 
the role. 

With respect to the officers, no changes are required with respect to Enron 
Direct Canada.  With respect to EES Canada, I propose that Rob be appointed 
as the Chairman, President and CEO and I be appointed as Secretary for the 
interim.

Unless I hear otherwise, I will proceed on the basis of these proposals.

Regards,

Mark Powell

Mark -

Given that South America legal resources are stretched thin, we will be 
checking with Francisco to see if he has time to pick up Columbia.  He knows 
it well and I don't believe that it will be particularly time-consuming for 
him.  But it would help free up Miguel Mendoza a bit for other South America 
matters.

I will expect Francisco to be cognizant of his other Wholesale obligations in 
saying "yes" or "no."

Hurray!  More good news from Argentina!  Today the Argentine Supreme Court 
granted TGS an injunction against payment of the stamp tax assessed by the 
Province of Rio Negro pending resolution of the matter.  Rio Negro recently 
rejected TGS's final administrative appeal against payment of the tax with 
penalties and interest in the amount of US $436 million!  Rio Negro had 
ordered payment by April 26 and threatened to commence collection 
proceedings.  Recall that 3 weeks ago, the Court also granted TGS an 
injunction against payment of the tax in Santa Cruz in the amount of US $17 
million which was unprecedented.

Dodged another bullet!
Cheers!
Michelle

		 Subject: Board Matters

I have spoken with a number of you regarding several Board-related matters,
and wanted to provide that information to everyone. These relate to the
following:

 Nominating Committee Results
 Citigroup
 Board Meeting Schedule
 Strategic Planning Meeting Schedule 
 Pre-Strategic Planning Lunches

Nominating Committee Results
 
The Nominating Committee has completed its deliberations and has recommended
11 individuals for election at this year's AGM to two-year terms. In
addition to the reelection of Ernie, Jerry, Jose Manuel, Keith, Maurits,
Terry, Tom and Tim, the Nominating Committee has proposed the following
individuals for election:

Kaushik Amin, Managing Director at Lehman Brothers NY, co-head of their
global fixed income division.

Fred Janbon, Global Head of Fixed Income at BNP Paribas, London

Azam Mistry, Director, Head of Risk Management Advisor--Treasury and Capital
Markets, HSBC, Hong Kong, and Co-Chair of our Asia-Pacific Steering
Committee

Thank you to everyone on the nominating commitee for your efforts,
particularly those of you who had an opportunity to meet these and other
prospective nominees.
 
Citigroup
 
The Nominating Committee chose not to nominate anyone from Citigroup for
election at this year's AGM. We have emphasized to Citigroup that this
decision is due to a variety of factors, including lack of attendance at
Board meetings by current and past Board members and the fact that Citi has
had a seat on the Board continuously since the Association was formed. We
have encouraged them to remain involved in ISDA activities with a view to
rejoining the Board at the earliest possible juncture. Please encourage your
Citigroup counterparts to get involved or remain involved in the
Association's activities.
 
Both Ravit and Thierry Sciard, who contacted us to offer himself as an
alternative for the position, were upset by the decision, but it is not
clear what the long-term effects will be. The most immediate tangible effect
is that Citi has indicated that it is withdrawing its co-sponsorship of the
Tuesday and Wednesday evening events at the Washington AGM. There is a
possibility that Lehman may be interested in sponsorship.
 
Board Meeting Schedule
 
Please make note of the Board meeting schedule for the remainder of the
year:

April 4 and 5 (over lunch each day at the AGM in Washington)

May 16-17 in Kyoto (more details below)

September 12 in London

November 13 in New York (note this is a change from prior schedules
distributed)

Strategic Planning Session
 
May 16 and 17 are the dates of our strategic planning session, which this
year will be at the Miyako Hotel in Kyoto. The details on the Miyako Hotel
are:

MIYAKO HOTEL
Sanjo Keage
Kyoto 605-0052
Japan
Phone: 81 75 771 7111
Fax: 81 75 751 2490
http:/www.miyakohotel.co.jp


The schedule is slightly different from past sessions. I will provide more
details on the specifics, but for your planning purposes, you should arrange
to be in Kyoto for lunch on Wednesday, May 16. (Bullet trains from Tokyo
that morning will get you there in time.) We will have dinner in the hotel
Wednesday evening after our afternoon session. On Thursday, May 17, we will
start with breakfast and have a working lunch, with the session ending
around 2:00. The afternoon will be spent visiting temples and perhaps going
on a sake tasting tour. (Fortunately, I do not believe that Francis Ford
Coppola is a sake producer.) Dinner that evening will be at a restaurant and
will be accompanied by a Geisha dance. Please plan to stay for all of the
events. There is nothing planned for Friday so that everyone (particularly
the Europeans) can get planes out of Osaka or Tokyo on Friday morning that
will get them back for the weekend.
 
Pre-Strategic Planning Luncheons
 
As in the past we will hold a series of luncheons in London, New York and
Tokyo where we will invite senior executives from member firms to share with
us their thoughts on issues affecting the industry. The tentative schedule
and locations for these lunches is as follows:

Wednesday, May 2    London    UBS (hosted by Tim Frederickson)

Friday, May 11            New York    AIG (hosted by Ernie Patrikis)

Tuesday, May 15        Tokyo         Royal Park Hotel (hosted by
Koshikawa-san)

In addition to attending the luncheon closest to your office, please
consider arriving in Tokyo a day early to join us at the Tokyo session.
Again, more details will follow. In the meantime, I would welcome any
suggestions for individuals we should invite to these luncheons in the
various centers.
 
I know this is a long email, but it covers the critical dates for the coming
months in one fell swoop. I am on holiday the week of Feb. 19 and will be in
Asia (visiting Beijing, Hong Kong and Tokyo) the week of Feb. 26. I will be
checking emails and voice mails.

Paul:  The ISDA meeting is tentatively set for Jan 18.  So it may be possible 
for me to be there on the 21st.  As always, the schedule could change, but I 
would make every effort to be there.  Again, congratulations!

It is true that there is no wall -- however, it is geographically separate.  
The equity trading is the end portion of the floor.  There are three hallways 
that go to equity trading, each about 10 feet long.  It would not be possible 
to hear anything said outside of the equity trading area.  Robert Bruce is 
working on updating our policy and procedures in Houston and by copy hereof 
ask him to update you.

Thanks for the enquiry.

I've had discussions with Gary this week and am now working out how soft the 
wall can be in light of that!  I understand from Gary that in Houston the 
Chinese walls are not as hard as I imagined ie no physical wall or separate 
security pass system.  Please confirm. Many thanks

Subject: Cypress Exploration Program - Operator/Cash Call Issue


	

Rick:  I wanted to inform you about a situation where a Commercial Team has 
subjected Enron to some material risk that did not get appropriate 
approval.               

 Here's the story:   On October 30, I received a funding request for my 
approval of approximately $260,000 representing a cash advance request on  
the Bernard No. 1 well, a 16,500 exploratory well in the Cypress Program.   
The request appeared pretty routine but as is our procedure, I had Don 
Rollins check it out .   Don discovered that we had already paid our cash 
call and this cash call represented our working interest partner, Kelley 
Oil's share, which is a highly unusual situation.  Checking further we 
discovered that  the well is being drilled under a farmout agreement from 
Kelley, who wanted to be operator.  Our guys (Thompson/Josey) wanted Enron 
(not Kelley)  to operate the well during the drilling phase but did not want 
to be official operator of record so they set up Rozel Onshore, our prospect 
generator in Lafayette to be our surrogate operator.  Kelley was upset about 
this and would not sign the Joint Venture Agreement unless the cash call 
provisons were deleted.  Thompson/Josey and team agreed and signed the 
agreement which has no initials from the Legal Department.   The effect of 
this was that Rozel/Enron would have to incur all the costs then bill and 
collect from Kelley.

Rick, as you are aware, the cash call provision in a JOA is the primary 
credit risk mitigant that an operator has to ensure that his partners pay 
their share of well costs before costs are incurred.  This can be 
particularly good protection if a well gets in trouble with lots of cost 
overruns that partners don't  want to pay.  In this case, our surrogate 
operator, Rozel has no established credit with oil service companys and no 
money of his own so all services including the drilling rig are having to be 
prepaid by Enron 100%.  The well is heavily front end loaded with costs with 
a total drill and complete exposure of over $4.0 million (if thing go ok!)

I discussed this with Dave Gorte and Brad Larson and we all agreed  that we 
are forced to fund since the well is drilling and failure to fund would shut 
down operations.   Also, keep in mind that this will be an ongoing obligation 
(and risk exposure) during this entire drilling phase.

Lessons Learned:
   1) The E&P merchant finance team has no business operating a deep S. 
Louisiana exploratory test.
   2)  Important provisions, like "cash call" should never be given away 
without appropriate risk assessment and approval.

Please call if you have questions.

It seems to me that our standard language should prohibit service providers 
from working on any similar project for a competitor or disclosing in any way 
that work was done for Enron.  Also, we may want to specify liquidated 
damages for violation of this covenant.  Any objections to this?

Rick,

As you recall we had previously decided to have E Power be the counterparty 
to BHP for formal arrangements in pursuing the terminal opportunity is Japan. 
Should we reconsider this approach given the new organization. E Power 
interest is in cheap fuel and not the terminal or pipelines. Please advise 
and I will handle with Carey. We have a meeting in Japan with BHP on Oct 16th 
to execute the CA.

		 Subject: Choice of Mexican Law - Vitro/Monterrey Project

Peggy Banczak called me yesterday to say that the Inter-American Development
Bank ("IADB") had indicated its refusal to fund its loan to the appropriate
ENE borrower in connection with the Enron-Vitro Monterry Cogeneration
Project ("Project") unless the PPA(s) (and construction contracts?), i.e.,
those contracts to be concluded between Mexican entities and calling for
performance in Mexico, be governed by Mexican law.  Peggy explained that
after long negotiation, ENE had been able to convince Vitro and Cementos
Apasco (and other power purchasers/construction companies?) to agree that
their contracts be governed by New York law but that despite this great
success, IADB now for policy reasons was insisting that those contracts be
governed by Mexican law.

Peggy and I talked with Rogelio Lopez-Velarde and Peggy subsequently
provided me copies of three memoranda dated August 15, September 18 and
September 27, 2000, addressed to Peggy and Robert Stephens of Bracewell &
Patterson from Rogelio Lopez-Velarde and Amanada Valdez.  In the August 15,
2000, memorandum Rogelio and Ms. Valdez analyzed the enforceability of
certain of the provisions of the PPA between Enron Energia Industrial de
Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. and Apasco should that agreement be governed by
Mexican law.  They recommended certain changes be made if the agreement were
to be governed by Mexican law.  In the September 18, 2000, memorandum
Rogelio and Ms. Valdez gave their opinion on the enforceability of the
"Suspension Remedy" contained in Section 13.5 of the PPA.  In their
memorandum of September 27, 2000, they opined principally that the provision
of Section 13.6 of the PPA specifically denying each "Capacity User" the
right to terminate the PPA except in the case of a "Producer Event of
Default under Section 132(a) (sic) has occurred and the Project has been
Abandoned" was unenforceable.  I have reviewed the three memoranda but I
have not reviewed the PPA nor any of the other underlying Project documents.

As Joe Dilg mentioned to you before we undertook last week our limited
review of the Enron-Vitro Amparo matter, we are not Mexican lawyers and
therefore we cannot opine on the Lopez Velarde, Heftye, Abogados memoranda
and opinions referenced above and we cannot opine on how the application of
Mexican law to disputes that could arise under agreements the IADB now
insists be governed by Mexican law might affect the enforceability of
provisions of those agreements or the agreements themselves.  

I consider the memoranda provided by the Lopez Velarde, Heftye, Abogados
firm, however, to be well reasoned and written.  As I have not seen the
underlying documents, I am not able to determine whether the August 15,
2000, memorandum addresses all of what the drafters characterize as the
"Challengeable Clauses" in the PPA in Section I.2.A.  My guess is that the
form from which the PPA has been developed is a form that ENE has used on
other occasions in circumstances that would permit the agreements to be
governed by laws of jurisdictions that have experience considering
sophisticated commercial disputes at a minimum and perhaps disputes
specifically arising under power purchase agreements.  If ENE does agree to
subject interpretation of the PPA and other affected contracts to Mexican
law, it would be worthwhile to again review the PPA and other affected
agreements to be absolutely sure that all of the "Challengable Clauses" are
identified and either changed in a manner acceptable to ENE to make them
enforceable or if not changed that the risks of leaving the provisions "as
is"  are fully understood and evaluated by ENE.  I do have the following
specific comments concerning the August 15, 2000, memorandum:

   1.   If they already have not been made, is it possible still to
convince the Mexican counter parties to make the changes Lopez Velarde,
Hefty, Abogados have suggested?  Based on the Lopez Velarde, Hefty, Abogados
memos, it seems to me that  ENE, as a condition to agreeing to accept
Mexican law as the governing law, would want to negotiate at least the
material changes to the PPA suggested by the Lopez Velarde, Heftye, Abogados
firm in the memoranda.

   2.   If it is not possible to negotiate the changes or is
possible only to negotiate some of the changes, with respect to the
"Discretionary Performance Prohibition" and the "Discretionary Condition
Prohibition" outlined in Sections I.1.1 A. and B, would only the
specifically applicable Performance or Condition provision be rendered
unenforceable or could the PPA in its entirety be deemed unenforceable if
either "performance of portions of the PPA [as opposed to performance of the
entire agreement] are left to the unilateral discretion of one of the
parties." or "compliance with some [as opposed to all] [of the conditions]
rests exclusively in the discretion of the obligor..."?

      Are there any Performance or Condition Prohibitions that
individually could be deemed to render unenforceable the entire PPA?

      If there are a number of Performance or Condition
Prohibitions that are not amended, could they in the aggregate be deemed
sufficient to render undenforecable the entire PPA?

   3.   Is there any other Challengable Clause or other clause in
the PPA or other affected agreement that without modification to make
enforceable should cause ENE not to entier into the PPA or other affected
agreement ?

   4.   Do the Discretionary Performance or Discretionary Condition
Prohibitions constitute events of default, even if the party in whose favor
they run do not attempt to enforce them, constitute an event of default that
would afford the "innocent party"  the right to demand rescission of the
PPA?

I understand that the PPA and the affected contracts all contain dispute
resolution provisions that would subject disputes to international
arbitration.    Assuming that the dispute resolution provisions are not
renegotiated, the fact that Mexican law, if agreed as the governing law,
will be interpreted by arbitrators and not Mexican courts is a factor that
could result in a more independent consideration and resolution of the
interpretation and application of Mexican law to disputes that may arise
under the contracts.  

If you have questions or wish to discuss this matter, please call me at
713-758-2518.

Program


Dear General Counsels:

The U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting has 
advised that on May 25, 2001, they will evaluate Enron's subcontracting 
program and compliance on any subcontracting plans in effect on current 
contracts.

This review will cover the last five (5) years.  All Forms 294 and 295 filed 
with the Small Business Adminstration along with the names of each 
Administrative Contracting Officer (U.S. Government employee responsible for 
monitoring the contract) for each contract will be subject to the review.

In addition, total subcontract placement with small businesses, small 
disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, and HubZone small 
businesses shall be reviewed.  Further, the amount of indirect or overhead 
costs, if any, apportioned to contract goals is subject to review.

We will also need information on the number of active suppliers Enron is 
currently using in the following categories:  large business, small business, 
small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business and HubZone 
business.  The review will cover these figures for one year ago if available.

Please contact me by Wednesday, April 11, 2001 and advise me of the number of 
contracts between the United States Government and the Enron entities you 
represent.  In the event any of the Enron entities which you represent have 
government contracts, we will need a member of your respective law 
department(s) to pull the government contracts, and all supporting 
documentation, from the Enron companies which you represent and be available 
to work with other members of the team.

If you have any questions, please contact me at 713-853-7224.

Thank you.

Sharon

		 Subject: Proposed Letter to WSJ


Mark:  As I am sure you agree, I thought that CA Attorney General Lockyer's 
comment last week in the WSJ was one of the most outrageous I have ever seen 
from a major public official.  I wanted to send a brief "Letter to the 
Editor" of the WSJ to that effect.  However, in light of the sensitivity of 
the entire CA situation in general and the further press last week in the New 
York Times, I did not want to do that without confirming with you that doing 
so would not be objectionable to the Company.  A copy of the proposed letter 
is attached.  I would propose to submit this in my individual capacity, not 
as counsel to the Company.  I'll wait to hear from you, or from Mark, Vicki 
or Rick before doing anything.    Thanks.  John

Does Matt have time to do all the LNG work?  My guess is that he may have the 
time.  Mark

FYI. This will greatly impact Matt's workload and availability for potential 
EBS activities. I would like to visit with you about this.

Alan,

As we discussed the other day, I'm forwarding my "work list" of projects 
either currently or soon to be underway that will be led by V V Rao's team 
out of Singapore (with support from Dubai and Houston):

1. Australia -- Northwest Shelf LNG "Wedge Quantities" bid.  Proposal for 
mid-term, firm (but declining over time) LNG supply for merchant trading 
activities prepared and being sent to NWS next week.  Preparation and 
negotiations of SPA, transportation and marketing contracts to follow.

2. Australia -- Northwest Shelf LNG Master Spot LNG Trading Agreement -- 
draft prepared and being sent to counterparty next week.  Negotiations to 
follow.

3. Indonesia -- PERTAMINA Master Spot LNG Trading Agreement -- draft prepared 
and being sent to counterparty next week.  Negotiations to follow.

4. Japan -- Osaka Gas Co. Master Spot LNG Trading Agreement -- draft prepared 
and sent to counterparty.  Expect responsive comments next week.  
Negotiations to follow.

5. Malaysia/Spain -- LNG fuel supply for Enron's Arcos IPP in Spain -- 
initial term sheet under development.  Expect this one to heat up in the next 
few months.

6. Malaysia -- Malaysia LNG Master Spot LNG Trading Agreement -- draft 
prepared and will be sent to counterparty later in the month.  Negotiations 
to follow.

7. Malaysia -- "Bintulu Hub" e-commerce venture with Malaysia LNG, Malaysia 
Int'l. Trading Co., Enron LNG Marketing and Enron Networks -- under 
development.  Legal needs will depend somewhat on final deal format.  Goal is 
to be set up for LNG commodity and LNG transportation capacity e-trading 
(possibly on a Deal Bench auction site platform) by year-end.  May expand to 
cover crude oil commodity and transportation capacity trading as well 
following recent meetings in London.

8. Japan -- LNG Receiving Terminal & gas and power marketing joint 
development project with Enron LNG Marketing LLC, BHP and EnCom.  Initial 
draft of joint development MOU prepared.  Negotiations to follow.

9. Korea -- KOGAS Winter Cargo Supply & Transportation Opportunities -- under 
develoopment.  Various MOU drafts have been exchanged, but deal structure and 
timing keep moving around.  Legal needs will ultimately depend somewhat on 
final deal format. 

10. Master LNG Vessel Transportation Capacity Access/Trading Agreements -- 
under early development, but should accelerate to match pace of no. 7 above.  
Document will then be used to propose access to numerous other LNG vessel 
owners/charterers who may wish to participate with Enron in making a market 
for spare transportation capacity.  Initial draft underway in Houston, but 
may be handed off to Singapore at some point.

As you can see, there's presently quite a lot of activity being undertaken 
from Singapore.  Much of this has arisen since the beginning of this year.  
Nancy and I have been involved in preparing initial drafts, providing 
comments, etc. from Houston (and occasional fly-in appearances)  and V V 
presently has on-the-ground legal support from an excellent Linklaters Team 
based in Singapore.  Matt Lee has now circled with V V's team and is 
undergoing both intensive commercial LNG training and intensive LNG trading 
contract training.  I suspect that on average this year, we could easily use 
70-100% of  Matt Lee's time (depending on how the above activities progress).

Kind regards,
Dan

1.  Enron Online Trading -- organized a legal team and solved enforceability 
and documentation issues around the world in a few short months for all the 
commodities traded by Enron.

   2.  Developing New Businesses -- major contributions in developing and 
structuring coal, insurance, band-width and power plant transactions.  The 
groundwork has been laid to develop very profitable businesses in each of 
these areas.

   3.  Aggressive Pursuit of Litigation Claims as a Plaintiff -- pursued 
Carolina Power & Light , Shell/Meridian, TVA, Ft. James and many others.  
Most have already settled with excellent results.  Successfully defended 
Wolfschlager, the last Panhandle case and Jolen. 

   4.  Lead Power Industry to Develop Master Power Agreement -- ENA lead the 
Edison Electric Institute coalition in developing  the first master power 
agreement.  ENA will benefit greatly in terms of dramatically lower 
transaction costs and greater liquidity.

   5.  Reduced Legal Costs as Percentage of Earnings -- brought overall legal 
costs to less than 6% of EBIT in 1999, down from 8% in 1998, despite the 
upsurge in origination activity.

   6.  Brought Finance and Corporate Legal Talent to Origination Deals -- as 
the origination work expanded dramatically and became much more complex, 
brought in more sophisticated legal talent to deals like UI and Peoples with 
great success.

   7.  New Concept to Better Manage and Communicate Legal Risks -- developed 
the legal risk book concept to highlight where the largest buckets of legal 
risks were and where efforts should be focused.

I agree completely. However, we probably need to develop language that 
defines an Enron competitor, as people will ask and we are considerably 
broader than we used to be.

 Mark - thanks and thank you for Mark Taylor's London Conference draft
agenda as well.  

All of your topics sound appropriate and significant. Clearly, this is an
ambitious agenda, which I assume contemplates a series of meetings over the
next months.  Also, the issue of updating the 1993 Commodity Definitions
comes up from time to time and we'd like to hear your thoughts re taking on
this very large project.

We had talked about meetings every two months - should they be more
frequent?.  

We'd much like to have a very brief call to discuss all this further next
week and to schedule the next meeting.  Could you suggest a 15-30 minute
period that works for you?

Regards, Ruth

Stacy and Ruth:

I propose the following agenda for the NA energy committee:

1.  convergence of commodity forms -- need to build a team to pursue
this
2.  California energy issues/solutions
3.  standardized provisions for master energy contracts -- setoff,
netting,
termination, etc.
4.  bankruptcy
5.  CFTC study of retail derivatives
6.  emerging market forms for paper, steel, etc.

Mark Taylor will send a list of proposed topics for the European
conference.  Let me know what you think.

Hello Mark -- given our e-mail traffic the last couple of days I wanted
to
quickly summarize our thoughts on next steps:

1.  Conference call - Mark, Ruth and Stacy re: agenda for NA Energy
Committee
2.  Conference call - Mark, Ruth, Stacy, Christophe, Katia, John re:
coordination of committee activities and agenda for December conference

Depending upon your schedule, we hope to try to get these calls
scheduled
either this week or early next week.

Many thanks!  -- Stacy

Hello Mark -- The European Energy Committee meeting was held in London
today. The attached documents, including the agenda, a memo on the
Bridge
agreement, and a copy of the Bridge agreement, were reviewed at this
morning's meeting.

Much of the discussion focused on explanation of the Bridge Agreement.
There
was some discussion about the German regulatory structure and the bridge
agreement.  Katia ran through the agenda in Houston and asked for ideas
on
December conference.  I was not able to hear all of the questions
entirely
but questions were asked about the outcome of the meeting.  Katia and
Christophe explained that it was a forum to exchange ideas and to
promote
use of ISDA within industry. The minutes should give us more detail.

In addition to a call re: the NA agenda, I think it would be worthwhile
to
also have a call w/Christophe, Katia and John Berry to discuss European
activities and to begin discussion on the December agenda. ISDA should
begin
to focus on an agenda as soon as possible so that we assure December's
conference is as productive as the Houston conference.  Thanks!

Official Unsecured Creditors' Committee

please look at the following:



As many of you are aware, Enron Corp. has been appointed as a member of the 
Official Unsecured Creditors' Committee of Pacific Gas and Electric Company 
("PG&E") which filed a bankruptcy reorganization proceeding on April 6, 
2001.   As a member of the committee, Enron will have access to certain 
confidential and/or non-public information regarding PG&E.  Enron and the 
other members of the committee will be signing a confidentiality agreement 
with PG&E that will restrict the use and disclosure of  this  confidential 
and/or non-public information.

Michael Tribolet with the Risk Assessment and Control group is Enron's 
designated representative to the committee, and Lisa Mellencamp with the ENA 
Legal Department will be assisting him in this role. Please be advised that 
they will be restricted from disclosing certain of the information that they 
receive.   Any requests for information regarding PG&E or its bankruptcy 
proceedings that Enron has obtained through its membership on the Committee 
should first be cleared by Lisa Mellencamp, Travis McCullough, Richard 
Sanders or me.

Dear Mark and Bob,

We will be kicking-off the above group in January. The core members are
scheduled to meet in advance to discuss the priority and order of the issues
to be discussed. For this purpose, I would appreciate if you could arrange
for someone to send me the minutes of the past committee meetings in NY and
London. If they are not open to non-chairs or the ISDA Board, I will digest
it and reduce them into plain Japanese summary.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Regards,

Terry

I am confused.  LeBeouf wanted to represent ENA and EES and Reliant never 
came up in the conversations.  We picked Brobeck and it was painful for 
LeBoeuf.  I think there must be some additional facts relative to New Power.

Subject: Reliant

You have asked that I recount the facts surrounding my failed attempt to hire 
LaBeouf Lamb to represent New Power in CA before the PUC.

In late July, I contacted Chris Hilen with LaBeouf's San Francisco office to 
ask if he would represent us in the Order Instituting Investigation which 
arose from the summer's price spikes in San Diego.  He said he would check 
with Reliant to ensure there were no conflicts.  When he returned my call, 
Reliant was unwilling to permit LaBeouf to proceed on our behalf.  Because I 
had been told earlier this year that Reliant would probably never be opposed 
to  us anywhere but Texas in the future, I called a contact at Reliant who 
referred me to Mike Jines in the general counsel's office.  Mr. Jines was 
unavailable, so I left him a voicemail message.  I told him that as I 
understood it, Reliant is only in the generation business in CA and not in 
the retail sales of electricity as we are.  We should both be interested in 
options that create better markets, lift rate caps and foment competition.  
Consequently, I felt there was no conflict here.  It took Mr. Jines some days 
to respond.  The intervention date was quickly approaching and needed legal 
assistance, I turned to Arter Hadden.  Some time after we had made that 
commitment (and after the intervention date), Mr. Jines called and suggested 
that perhaps something could be worked out.  Due to the press of other 
business, I did not return the call as the immediate situation had been 
resolved.

In October then, as we searched for a lobby firm in Sacramento, one person 
who was highly recommended told us Reliant would be "extremely uncomfortable" 
if she were to represent us, too.  She opted not to interview with us.  Since 
the message was similar to the original message to LaBeouf, I have moved on 
to find another lobbyist and have not followed up with Jines.

If you would like to discuss this more, please call.

		 Subject: Fidelity update

Last week during the holidays, we made a lot of progress w/ Fidelity 
regarding their "take-out" from the Partnership at Dallas.  We exchanged 2 
drafts of a Letter Agreement which says ENA (or an affiliate) will buy their 
99% LP interest in Landfill Gas Investments, LP (LGI) on or before Jan 31, 
2001.  Included in our draft was a provision whereby the ENE Guaranty would 
be extinguished.  However, late yesterday Fidelity came back and said they're 
not willing to extinguish the Guaranty completely.  The way the deal w/ 
Fidelity will be structured, ENA will pay them the delta between the $5.2MM 
initial payment they made less the accrued tax credits on the date we close 
(est to be $300K+/-).  Fidelity wants 2 things:

protection in the event the IRS disallows/disqualifies the tax credits 
accrued (i.e., the $300K), and
protection against any environmental claims that may have occurred while they 
were a partner in LGI (June, 200 thru Jan, 2001).

There are 2 basic alternatives to consider:

replace the existing guaranty to LGI with a new guaranty to Fidelity with a 
specific cap on the tax credit amount ($300K+/-) and with the same 
environmental coverage (up to $5MM) as currently exists but restricting it to 
issues which occurred while they were a partner.  The probability of either 
ever being triggered is extremely remote.  Replacing the benefactor from LGI 
to Fidelity is significant for us because it eliminates future environmental 
exposure related to LGI as well as prevents potential future buyers of our LP 
interest from seeing that ENE once was willing to issue such a guaranty.
replace the existing guaranty with an indemnity from ENA which provides 
Fidelity with the same protection as alternative #1.  Per ENA accounting 
since the amount of exposure is limited to $5.3MM in aggregate, this would 
not be significant/material enough to be separately identified as a balance 
sheet item.

The problem we have is Fidelity has a Guaranty "in hand" and unless you give 
me approval to go back and structure our deal around them, we don't have any 
leverage to get them to release it.  They are willing to work with us on 
either of the 2 alternatives listed above.  This is the only remaining 
commercial issue left w/ Fidelity.

Please advise or call to discuss further.  Ext. 33212.  Thanks!

RANDY

		 Subject: Year 2000 - Accomplishments

Peter - Some time ago you suggested that at year end review time I should 
provide you with a list of significant accomplishments.  The following is 
such list:

January through June with ENA
NSTAR All RequirementsTransaction - While similar in structure to the United 
Illuminating transaction, the NSTAR deal provided challenge in that it came 
together in a very accelerated time frame.  We did not have the luxury of 6 
months of negotiations as we did in UI.  We essentially structured and 
executed a deal in less than 3 weeks.  It was also a challenge in that I had 
no experience working with these particular clients (Kevin Presto, Dana 
Davis, Ed Baughman and John Llodra of East Power Trading/Mid Markets.  
Another significant hurdle was the education process of the utility and its 
attorneys which was essential to get them comfortable with the complexities 
of an all requirements trading document.
Consolidated Edison Turbine deal - This transaction was blown up at the 
eleventh hour, it was another challenging deal which required a creative 
structure to flip turbines into a project and take back a call on power.  
Again the education of the utility and structuring of the transaction made 
this particular deal difficult.

July through November with ECC
Sunoco structured power transaction - This was the first project I worked on 
in the Toronto office and was the first back to back transaction completed 
off of the British Energy PPA.  While the Calgary lawyers had put together a 
very good back to back precedent, there was still a great deal of negotiation 
involved in completing the deal and complexity involved in maintaining the 
requisite back to back transaction.
G-6 structured transaction - This deal just (as of 40 minutes ago) blew up.  
Notwithstanding that the deal will not be completed, it was a very 
complicated deal which involved a highly negotiated services agreement, 
arrangements for ECC to take initial equity and an option for additional 
equity and trading documentation.  This project required negotiating with 6 
municipal electric utilities who were trying to set up a retail affiliate to 
market power in Ontario.  The structure would have ECC as a risk management 
and settlement services provider in exchange for being the exclusive 
wholesale supplier of energy to the G-6.  This involved mitigating and 
structuring around a myriad of legal issues.
TransCanada structured power transaction - This was another back to back 
transaction off of the British Energy position.  These deal was challenging 
in that it involved a more sophisticated counterparty who had certain 
idiosyncratic issues such as regulatory risk and credit.  We were able to 
structure a deal which balanced the parties competing interests and 
maintained the commercial value of the transaction for Enron.
OEFC Non-Utility Generation Contract Management - We have just recently been 
awarded the project and have begun negotiations with OEFC regarding 
management of the NUG contracts.  However, the teamwork exhibited among legal 
and commercial and between the Toronto and Calgary legal and commercial 
groups showed how effective the ECC operation can be.  Your advice and 
initial review together with my implementation structured an RFP response 
that did the right thing: protected ECC from potential legal risks.  While 
there was commercial pressure to bend from these principals we stood our 
ground and as a result have a much stronger bargaining position.
Transition from Houston to Toronto - While both you and Mark know that there 
were some initial issues with respect to working out the arrangements for my 
move from Houston to Toronto I believe that I have transitioned quite 
smoothly.  I think that I have quickly gained the respect and trust of those 
in the Toronto office and of Rob Milnthorp.  Being the lone lawyer in a 
satellite office presents unique challenges; especially when the commercial 
folks are not content doing bread and butter type transactions but rather 
present highly structured deal on a weekly or even daily basis.  I understand 
and appreciate that you have gone out of your way to provide support to me 
when I have had issues arise on Toronto matters. In return I feel that I have 
provided you with comfort that the legal interests of Enron Canada are being 
protected and that our commercial team is receiving top notch legal support.  
I have done this while still managing all of the little things that go along 
with moving your family 2000 miles.

Thanks for the update.  It sounds overall like the direction will not be

Mark:
The attached email raises the following three questions with respect to 
Enron's endorsement and adoption of the attached statement of principles on 
Security and Human Rights and my response is noted after each question:
 Are there any show stoppers that would argue that Enron should not publicly 
express its "endorsement" of these polices? No.
If Enron were to express its endorsement of the policy statement, what if any 
material problems do you think your business line might encounter in 
implementing the policy?  Given the limited physical presence of EGM in 
foreign locations, I would not expect implementation to be a problem.
Do you see any unintended practical or legal consequences that might arise 
from Enron publicly adopting or endorsing this as policy?  The commitment 
under the "Consultation and Advice" section of the statement on "Interactions 
between Companies and Public Security" provides: "In their consultations with 
host governments, Companies should take all appropriate measures to promote 
adherence to international law enforcement standards, particularly those 
reflected in the U.N. Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the 
U.N. Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms."  I believe we should 
take note that "all appropriate measures" is very broad and could publicly be 
construed to mean an obligation to withdraw our operations from a particular 
country that fails to abide by these principles.
My response pertains only to the operations of Enron Global Markets.   I will 
be checking my emails while I am in Singapore and will be happy to address 
this further if you would like me to do so.

		 Subject: New Security and Human Rights Policy - Legal Comments

Rob has asked me to collect legal department views on the attached statement 
of principles regarding Security and Human Rights that Enron Corp is 
considering endorsing. These have been worked out over the past several 
months by a task force of the US and UK governments, along with 
representatives of industry (including Enron) and NGOs (including Amesty and 
Human Rights Watch) under the auspices of Secretary fo State Albright and 
Foreign Secretary Cook.  As a result, we really don't  have the ability to 
change the text, which is fixed. 

As you know, Enron is very concerned about human rights issues because of 
their intrinsic value and their community relations impacts.These guidelines 
would be in addition to the Human Rights Policy Statement the Enron board 
adopted last year, which really do not touch on security matters as such. I 
have sent this to each of your since your business units are those that have 
the most extensive operations in the developing countries in which these 
issues are of primary concern.  (I am separately collecting comments/concerns 
from within EES and EECC.)

The Enron effort on this guideline project has been lead by Lauren Goldblatt 
of the Corp. PR group. Lauren has run the attached drafts past Mike Hicks and 
Pete Vandergam at Corp. Security for their views of whether this can be 
implemented by Enron.  We as the legal department have been asked to express 
our view on are the following:

(a) Are there any show stoppers that would argue that Enron should not 
publicly express its "endorsement" of these polices?
(b) If Enron were to express its endorsement of the policy statement, what if 
any material problems do you think your business line might encounter in 
implementing the policy?
(c) Do you see any unintended practical or legal consequences that might 
arise from Enron publicly adopting or endorsing this as policy?

Please take an hour few hours to read through the materials, or have one of 
your lawyers do so. You might need to consult with your operation personnel 
for their practical views as well.   I would be grateful if you could express 
any concerns you may see with the guidelines by November 7 (Wednesday) so 
that I can coordinate comments and get the responses out.   (The deadline for 
Enron and other companies to express their endorsement of the policy has been 
extended from the November 8 deadline expressed in the attached to November 
15. To allow time for Enron to deal with responses, we have been asked to get 
our feed back to Lauren by November 8 (Thursday).)

You cane-mail your comments or phone them to  me at 713-646-6309. If I get 
suffucient expressions of interest for a conference call by Monday, I will 
set up a call in number for Wednesday morning US. 

Thanks, I appreciate your views and comments.

John, Rob and I have talked and   Rob would like you to take the lead on 
this.  Deborah, I need you to work  with  John S. to see how our 
international EES business (Europe, Mexico, etc.) might be   affected by this 
and whether we take this position.  I am sure Rob and JOhn will  have the 
history and expert opinion as to how this should be handled, and my guess is, 
this issue primarily affects EECC at this time.  Maybe one of the Apache 
lawyers can take the lead for the traditional EES business.   Rob will be in 
next week and then going out of town and I will pick up for him then.

Rob and Vicki:

Over the past few months we have participated in an initiative aimed at 
developing a voluntary set of guidelines governing human rights and security 
arrangements.   I would greatly appreciate your thoughts, review, and sign 
off on the guidelines.  

Should we agree to endorse the principles, we must send a letter to the U.S. 
State Department by November 8, 2000.     I have attached a fact sheet as 
well as the revised principles for your review.   

The principles and signatories will be announced by Madeline Albright and 
Secretary Robin Cook in November. 

Thank you for time and consideration on this.  Please do not hesitate to call 
with any questions.  I can be reached either by cell phone (917) 821-0724 or 
by  voicemail at 212-702-3916.

Best Regards,

promoted to that rank, but I didn't want to convey the new title to him until 
I had your confirmation that the promotion was ok with you.   Thanks.

Subject: Operations, Monday Meetings, and Responsibilities

As Enron Australia continue to develop there is a need to constantly review 
and refine operational procedures and responsibilities.

Enron's senior staff meeting on Monday has been created as the primary forum 
to discuss and promote the commercial initiatives of our entire operations.  
These meetings are mandatory for all Director and equivalent level staff 
within the organisation across all Enron companies in Australia.  The 
meetings will be held in the boardroom at 4.30PM on each Monday (or Tuesday 
in case of holiday).  Accordingly, I encourage you to avoid scheduling any 
conflicts with this timing.
The first meeting will be held on Monday 30 October.

David Minns will play a central role to the coordination of the commercial 
activities of this group.  Please supply David with a list of your group's 
major deal initiatives should you intend to be absent from this meeting.  In 
David's absence please provide me with this list should you be unable to 
attend this meeting in person or not be in a position to dial in to the 
meeting. 

In addition, Heidi Mason will assume greater responsibility for coordinating 
support resources throughout office.  All administrative staff will report to 
Heidi in addition to their current direct report.

The assumption of greater coordinating responsibility for David and Heidi is 
designed to maximise the amount of effort each Director is expending on 
direct commercial activities as well as increasing efforts to maximise 
existing resources and cross-commodity deal opportunities.

A general office email will be sent advising of this initiative.  This email 
will also incorporate explicit comment on reporting and expense obligations.  

Your cooperation in supporting this initiative is appreciated.

Rosemary,

Should we limit the presentations to ISDA members only?  What about
FPML/Swift/Londex or e speed, or treasury connect, etc?  I believe we should 
try
to be inclusive of any important venture, member value from attendance goes up
as a result.

Regards,

George

We can definitely send you copies of these invoices in the future to help 
facilitate your review and processing of bills. We send the originals to Rob 
Walls in Houston. We will begin with the March invoices which will be going 
out shortly.
    By copy of this memo to Rob Walls, we are advising him that we will be 
sending you copies of these invoices. Please let me know if this is 
satisfactory for your purposes. Marty

Dear April,

Would you mind sending the original of the statements of fees of the
subjects below to the S?o Paulo Office? Usually, before the invoices are
cleared they receive comments, codes, they are submitted to provisions for
cash and may route to different people for review.

Please let me know if this is not any inconvenient for you. Current
subjects invoiced by Skadden are:

                    Dona Francisca (John Novak)
                    RioGen Merchant - Eletrobolt (John Novak)

Thank you.

		 Subject: Plan B Auction - Need for Approvals ?

Mark, thanks for the voice mail.  In terms of a risk memo, I agree that one 
should not be necessary as in many respects this can be characterized as 
normal course trading within position limits under a standardized Master 
Agreement and without an outlay of capital, but hopefully the following 
(together with my memo from last night - copy attached) suffices to the 
extent a risk memo is required.

In terms of unusual risks:

1.  We do not have any rights to collateral under the proposed Master.  
However, the counterparty is the Balancing Pool which is essentially 
Government of Alberta credit risk.  Derek Davies is I believe dealing with 
Credit to resolve credit issues.  In fact, I believe the Balancing Pool is 
taking significant risk as it is selling the power firm under a Master which 
does not match up to the interruptible nature of the PPAs it holds.

2.  The Balancing Pool will be secured under the Master by a parental 
guarantee of Enron Corp. and has a somewhat discretionary right to call for 
collateral from us under the Master if there is a material change in Enron 
Corp.'s creditworthiness.

3.  It is a requirement of the auction that we will have entered into 
back-to-back physical hedges for 70% of the volume we acquire, and we are 
currently working at putting those deals in place conditional on us bidding 
and being successful in the auction.  Penalties can be imposed if 70% of the 
volume purchased is not properly hedged.

4.  As we are dealing with the Government of Alberta, we always run the risk 
(as we are somewhat seeing now with respect to the Sundance PPA we acquired 
in the first auction) that they can change the auction rules, the market 
rules or the legislation in ways that are adverse to us.  In terms of the 
auction rules, as with the first auction, they could be better drafted, but 
our fundamental concern will be to make sure that it is clear that if we post 
a bid deposit and do not bid that we get the deposit back, and to ensure that 
the rules are clear enough that we are comfortable that we are in complete 
control of whether or not we can comply with the rules.

Peter.

Subject: Plan B Auction - Need for Approvals ?

Mark, as I have mentioned to you the Plan B Alberta Power Auction is 
scheduled for Nov 29/00, under which Enron Canada can purchase for one-year 
terms, in each of three successive years, up to approximately 300MW/year #1;  
130MW/year #2; and 65MW/year #3, of the unsold PPA capacity that reverted 
back to the Balancing Pool of Alberta following the first auction last 
August.  The bid qualification documentation needs to be in Friday and US 
Thanksgiving is Thursday/Friday.  I wanted you to be aware of this, and 
determine from you if any corporate approvals need to be obtained.

Firstly, Derek Davies/John Zufferli will only be bidding to the extent 
authorized by Lavo.

Secondly, bid qualification commits us to the rules of the auction, the forms 
of documentation to govern both the auction and the purchase if we are 
successful, and requires a bid deposit (approximately C$6.5MM), but does not 
obligate us to bid and, provided we comply with the auction rules, the Bid 
Deposit will be returned after the auction.

Thirdly, unlike the PPA auction the risks are much less significant in terms 
of volume and term.  In terms of documentation, if we are the successful 
bidder, we will be buying power from the Balancing Pool under a physical 
Master, which seems to be a Canadianized version of the EEI Master and which, 
although not entirely to our liking, is generally satisfactory.

Fourthly, the position will, I understand, be managed in the power trading 
book within approved position limits.  Note:  The nominal amounts owing (i.e. 
no up front payment is required) on an unhedged basis for the entire 300MWs 
in year #1 would be something like C$260MM, assuming a C$100/MW purchase 
price.  Year #2 would be C$114MM and year #3 would be C$57MM.

Given the nature of the transaction, the short time that we have with US 
Thanksgiving intervening, and numerous other demands, I do not believe that a 
DASH, Risk Memo and/or Board Approval is necessary, but please let me know.

I will leave you a brief voice mail to follow-up.

Peter.

		 Subject: The Ongoing CalPX Indemnity Agreement Issue

The CalPx has written us a letter saying that if we do not sign their 
proposed indemnity agreement by January 12, we will have to post collateral 
(letter of credit) for the full extent of our exposure to them (approx 
$25million).  Implicit in this demand is the threat that if we do not post 
the collateral, they will not allow us to do any business with them.

All things considered, I recommend that we consider posting the collateral 
and that we do not sign the indemnity agreement.  This recommendation assumes 
that we want to continue to do some residual business with the CalPX.  
Obviously, if our traders don't care about doing any business with them, we 
should just call their bluff and quit trading with them, but I don't think we 
would really want to do this.

The reason why I do not think we should sign the indemnity agreement is 
because it exposes us (Enron Corp.) to the very real PX credit meltdown 
risk.  Under the PX's Surety Bond with AIG,  if creditors of the CalPX,  say, 
the big three California Utilities for example,  teetering as they are on the 
brink of insolvency,  were to default to the PX, then AIG must keep the CalPX 
whole.  If AIG pays any money to the PX, it will immediately turn to its 
indemnity agreements with all the non-defaulting participants (including 
ours)  and try to recover from them.  Although the indemnity agreements 
purport to limit  AIG's ability to recover from us to our own specific 
default with the PX,  I do not think we should rely on the wording of the 
agreement to guarantee that we would not be washed into some kind of broader 
claim by AIG in a meltdown situation.  The wording is too ambiguous.   If I 
were outside counsel, I would not write us a legal opinion saying that if we 
signed the indemnity agreement we would not have any exposure in a meltdown.  

Therefore, given the solvency crisis with the big three utilities, I think we 
should assume there will be a major payment default and  I think,  if we must 
continue to do business with the PX, we should do it on the basis of posting 
collateral for our exposure.  Such collateral would be clearly tied to our 
own default and we should be able to control our own default risk with them.  
I have asked Tracy to set up a conference call to go over this reasoning.

		 Subject: OGC/AGC Approval Policy for More Than One Year Contracts

Mark:

Got your voice mail on this. I wasn't sure if you were suggesting the policy 
for trading contracts or all contracts of greater than a year.

My thoughts are as follows:

1) Policy Scope: I think we need to address whether the Policy will extend to 
trading as well as origination transactions. As you know, often there is a 
very blurry line.

2) Existing Masters: If a master is in place, confirmations will be used for 
terms of one month to greater than one year. I don't think it will be 
practical for us to approve these confirmations before signature unless there 
are material modifications done to the pre-approved confirmation template in 
the master, which would require Legal approval in the present state of 
affairs.  I assume the Policy would only apply to individually negotiated 
contracts outside a Master Agreement.

3) Order of Magnitude: We should consider having a dollar figure (determined 
simply by multiplying the notional or contract volume x the contract price or 
the Enron financial commitment amount), coupled with the one year or greater 
term, that would require the additional OGC/AGC approval in order to make 
sure the requirement is imposed only for higher dollar contracts.

I would be happy to discuss this with you further.

Alan

Subject: URGENT & IMPORTANT: Note re main legal risks re the EEX Spot Market

Joe,

Further to our discussion yesterday, when you mentioned that you wished to 
commence trading on the EEX Spot Market on and from Wednesday 9th August, I 
set out below the main elements of legal risk, as I see them, in the various 
elements of the Exchange Rules.  You should note as a general matter that the 
Exchange Rules are largely vague and ambiguous which only heightens the 
potential legal legal risk.

The Counterparty to our trades

Enron's counterparties to trades will be the individual market participants 
with whom our bids and offers get matched - our counterparty will not be the 
Exchange itself or a clearing house.

We shall only be told the identity of the counterparty(ies) with whom we have 
neen matched after that matching process has occurred.  There is no mechanism 
to filter counterparties based on credit quality, types of counterparty etc.  
Hence, there is no effective credit control left to trading participants over 
whom they should do deals with.

Collateral Arrangements

As far as security by way of collateral for trading exposures among the 
participants is concerned, initial collateral of Euros 100,000 is posted with 
the Exchange in one of the prescribed methods (bank guarantee, cash,etc) via 
one's "clearing" bank.  The Exchange will monitor the exposures of all the 
counterparties and can require more collateral to be posted overnight, on a 
variation margin basis, if a counterparty is exposed over the level of 
collateral previously posted.  Note that the collateral which the Exchange 
may require to be posted does not seem to include cover for any unpaid 
amounts where a participant has not paid for power delivered - it appears 
that it will only cover the mark-to-market value of deals struck on the 
Exchange which remain outstanding (i.e., pre-delivery)

In terms of the amount of collateral required to be posted, it would appear 
that each trade will be calculated on a gross, rather a net, basis (even for 
buys and sells with the same counterparty and not just trades with different 
counterparties).  The rules are very vague here.  I would suggest that your 
traders and RAC touch base on this issue and understand - by speaking to the 
Exchange if necessary - exactly the methodology of calculating our collateral 
posting requirement.  

Whilst the Exchange will monitor the participants' exposures and call for 
margin from the Participants' clearing banks as appropriate, there is an 
obligation imposed on each participant itself to be able itself to monitor 
its own exposures and its own collateral posting requirement.  It is unclear 
whether the Exchange has provided sufficient information in relation to the 
model to be used to enable us to fulfill this requirement.  I suggest that 
back office and RAC look into this immediately in conjunction with your 
trading staff.  Technically we can have our membership suspended if we do not 
comply with the Rules; more importantly,  from a good buisness practice 
perspective, we should be able to comply with the rules plus be able to know 
these figures each day.   RAC and your traders should therefore check that we 
can do this immediately.    

In the event that a counterparty defaults, there are two points to note.   
Firstly, what constitutes a default is unclear.  The Rules state that a 
default is where a counterparty is, to quote, "unable" to meet its 
obligations under the Rules.  Strictly, inability (e.g., insolvency) would 
not cover unwillingness (e.g.,, counterparty can pay but does not wish to pay 
for whatever reason).  Clifford Chance Germany have advised me that they feel 
that a German court would stretch the meaning to include unwillingness to 
meet obligations  but, of course, point out that this would be for a judge 
ultimately to decide.

Secondly,  even if a counterparty is in default as defined, there is no 
absolute legal obligation on the EEX to realise / call upon the collateral 
posted with it.  This will depend upon whether the management board of the 
EEX exercsies a discretion to instruct the EEX to do so.  In my view. the 
Exchange could well take the view that as the trades are a matter between the 
individual participants (as the Exchange is not the counterparty), the 
Exchange may well be unwilling to realise collateral until the outcome of 
arbitration between the parties to a dispute.  Clearly this could be a number 
of weeks or months after the non-payment dispute arose and hence increasing 
our credit risk.  Please note that there is no clear recourse to the Exchange 
in the event that the Exchange itself refuses to realise collateral.

If the Exchange does realise the collateral however, it will hold it for the 
benefit of all Participants.  Note, however, that this does not seem to cover 
previously unpaid amounts as mentioned above. 

Taxes

End consumers can be participants on the Exchange.  As this is the case, if 
we get matched with an end consumer, then apparently we open ourselves up to 
potential liability to pay German energy taxes.   Clifford Chance have advise 
me that, whilst this remains an unresolved issue, apparently the German 
fiscal authorities appear only to ensure that German-based entities pay such 
tax, rather than foreign-based ones such as ECTRL, which is our trading 
participant.  If you require further details on this, please refer to Tina 
Ward in Tax Department.

Renewable Energy Sources Act.

Again, if we, as a seller, were matched with an end-consumer, then under this 
Act we are obliged to ensure that we source approximately 3.45% of the energy 
sold from a renewable source.  I understand that this is approximately 4 
times as expensive as normal domestic power, coming in at around 16.75 
pfennigs per kWh.  It is entirely unclear how this will be monitored and 
enforced in respect of dealings on the Exchange, although Cliffords' view is 
that this will be done in some way through the Balancing mechanism.  May be 
your traders should look into this in greater detail, should it be of 
concern. 

Settlement

On a purely logistical level, for your general information, please note that 
physical power delivery is T+1, whereas Buyer settles T+2. 

The Exchange states that bills from sellers to buyers will go to the buyers 
via the Exchnage.  It is unclear how the mechanics of this work (they are not 
dealt with in the Rules to any greater extent).  I would suggest that your 
trading staff and our settlements staff look into this immediately, by 
speaking directly to the Exchange if necessary.  It should also be borne in 
mind that I assume that invoices will have to raised and issued within the 
T+2 framework.


IMPORTANT NOTE:

Clearly we want eventually to put this trading participation thorough a 
formal and final CACs  process (the rules have totally altered since we 
CACs'd it last time three weeks ago).  However, I understand that you would 
like to be able to trade from tomorrow, which will be a few days in advance 
of the CACs  process (additional rules in German have only just been sent to 
me, and hence I cannot tell you at present what is the import of these).  In 
this respect, please note that ECTRL is joining as a Market-Maker and hence, 
under the Exchange Rules, if you wish to proceed, we would have the 
obligation from tomorrow to quote firm two way prices during normal market 
opening hours.  The Exchange can promulgate rules prescribing the length of 
time for which bids / offers are active, minimum / maximum volumes bid / 
offerred, the width of spreads, etc.,.; I understand from Clifford Chance 
that the Exchange has not yet prescribed these rules.  What we do know at the 
moment is that if we fail "too often" to quote as a market maker, then the 
exchange can remove / suspend us as a trading participant.  In order to 
mitigate your risk at present therefore, you may wish to consider the size of 
volumes we would quote and width of spreads, etc.., and discuss with RAC and 
/ or Credit beforehand.

Finally, I understand that: (a) Dresdner's banking terms for us have still 
not been agreed (apparently these are being dealt with at an Enron Houston 
Legal Department level) and therefore I cannot tell you whether Dresdner 
would be willing to provide the collateral guarantee etc before these are 
agreed and (b) I understand that the EEX still has some outstanding points re 
our Balancing arrangements which would need to be finalised before we could 
trade.  Sandip is in contact with Enron Houston over (a) and I understand 
that Heribert and Michael Schuh are dealing with the Balancing 
arrangements.   

Subject to clearing the items in (a) and (b), and discussing volumes, spread 
etc with RAC / Credit etc.,  if you wish to proceed tomorrow, please let me 
know as I shall need to write to the Exchange this afternoon informing them 
of this (our application forms were submitted under the caveat that we would 
write to them when we wished our membership to go active).

Kind regards

Mark

Here are my thoughts so far:

1.  Initial Legal Team -- Jeff Hodge, Jim Keller, Carol St. Clair, Aaron 
Rothwarg

2.  Spot Check the Forms -- over the next week

3.  Conform Forms to ENA Forms -- over next two months

4.  Develop Form Approval Process -- dual approvals by EES and ENA

5.  Develop Deal Approval Process -- deals above a certain size (or material 
variations from the form) would require concurrent EWS approval

6.  Request List of Major Contract Concerns from Traders -- items that cannot 
be hedged

Mark:  As noted in the few attached e-mails, we have been asked to give some 
general advice on municipalization to the City of Bakersfield, CA.  I assume 
that this is not an issue from a conflcit perspective, but because it 
"touches" CA I had raised it with Vicki just in case there was something that 
i was not aware of .  Could I bother you to Reply to this and just let me 
know if you see any possible problem with us doing this work?  Thanks.

It was good to catch up with you briefly on Friday.  It sure seems like 
everything is going very well for you.  With everything you have going on, 
both domestically and internationally, I appreciate your taking the time to 
get together.  I'm sure we will be speaking in the not too distant future as 
the CA developments continue to unfold over the next few weeks.

Thanks.

Vicki:  I assume this is not a problem from a conflict, but just wanted to
double check since it "touches" CA.  As you may know from the trade press,
a number of cities, etc. have been looking into the possibility of forming
their own muncipallly owned utilities in light of all the CA problems.
This will undoubtedly be a long and arduous process by any city that
pursues it and probably will not go anywhere, at least not in the short
term.  Nonetheless, I just wanted to check.  I assume we are still on for
this afternoon at 2:00 p.m.  Thanks.  John

John,

 As mentioned in my E-mail, I have been contacted by the City Attorney of
Bakersfield, Cal., a city of about 150,000 concerning our ability to advice
the City concerning it operating its own electric utility.  I told him that
because of our work for Enron that I would need to check whether we would

I would appreciate your thoughts.  Bakersfield is in  P G & E's service

Subject: Cline/Panther Principal Payment

This memo is being sent to inform you that the September 30 Panther principal 
payment was made today and to clarify the confusion around the delay for the 
payment. Panther is one of the operating subsidiaries in our DPR Holding 
Company relationship with Chris Cline.

As many of you are aware, we are in the process of restructuring the Panther 
loan. Panther has violated certain financial covenants as a result of the 
lack of coal production when the mine was temporarily idled. These covenant 
violations put the loan in default and put us in a position to restructure 
certain aspects of the relationship. (All principal and interest payments 
have been made as scheduled despite the shutdown).

Part of the restructuring may involve deferring certain principal payments 
until 6/30/00 when Panther is expected to resume coal production. Since we 
are in the process of negotiating certain changes and since DPR Holding 
Company was sitting on $2.0 mm to be used for the payment and/or dividend 
distributions, they asked if they could wait until the distribution payment 
date in November before making the principal payment. This would give us a 
few more weeks to finalize the restructuring negotiations and perhaps enable 
them to defer the payment until June. This would also allow DPR to make a 
larger dividend distribution to both us and Cline. 

I told them that this was okay but that it did not constitute a waiver or 
decision to defer the payment. Unfortunately, this was not communicated well 
internally. I felt that this was an acceptable action because the company has 
the money and we are in the process of restructuring the repayment schedule. 
I also viewed it as a minor accomodation to Cline who has personally spent 
over $5 million on equipment for the project since January and has not 
charged the joint venture. 

However, to avoid hurting the relationship or DPR's reputation internally, 
Cline made the payment today.

COMPANIES CRACK DOWN on the increasing sexual harassment by e-mail.

Using computer-monitoring devices provided by Enron Software Inc., 
Burlington, Mass., 20th Century Fox scans employees' e-mail to stop the flow 
of sexually offensive messages, says Jeff Uslan, manager of information 
protection. After an e-mail harassment incident, Image First, a New Castle, 
Del., uniforms maker, notified workers that e-mail will be reviewed for any 
violation of its antiharassment policy.

Fully 31% of more than 1,000 human-resources officials surveyed by 
Philadelphia labor-relations lawyer Stephen Cabot and the American Management 
Association reported that employees have sometimes gotten sexually harassing 
e-mails; 85% of the employers have policies to avert problems. Employers 
including First Union Corp., Charlotte, N.C., have fired people recently for 
sending harassing e-mail.

electronic trail documents allegations, says Kathleen Neville, a 
sexual-harassment consultant.

Yes, National Power is one of two largest UK power generators.  They also

Mark;

Randy Young suggested that I send you an update regarding the above captioned 
deal.  This is a total energy management services deal where Enron Argentina 
is currently providing billing services to Azurix Argentina.  The TEM 
Agreement was executed on August 25, 2000.  The contract term is 3 years and 
the NPV is approximately US$900,000.

Azurix Argentina is facing a very difficult situation arising from its Buenos 
Aires Province water concession agreement.  Over the past few days, local 
newspapers have informed that Mr. Carlos Ruckauf, the BA Governor, has called 
a local congress extraordinary session "to consider the early termination of 
Azurix water concession agreement" (sic).  The BA Province is claiming that 
Azurix did not fulfill the contracted investments.  In case the Azurix 
concession is revoked, our agreement will also be terminated.

Rgds,

Sami

Germany?  

I am trying to help out someone who is looking for a U.S. firm (or a firm
with a U.S. office) that also has an office in Frankfurt, to assist with a
large business transaction.

Many thanks.

		 Subject: New Security and Human Rights Policy - Legal Comments

Rob has asked me to collect legal department views on the attached statement 
of principles regarding Security and Human Rights that Enron Corp is 
considering endorsing. These have been worked out over the past several 
months by a task force of the US and UK governments, along with 
representatives of industry (including Enron) and NGOs (including Amesty and 
Human Rights Watch) under the auspices of Secretary fo State Albright and 
Foreign Secretary Cook.  As a result, we really don't  have the ability to 
change the text, which is fixed. 

As you know, Enron is very concerned about human rights issues because of 
their intrinsic value and their community relations impacts.These guidelines 
would be in addition to the Human Rights Policy Statement the Enron board 
adopted last year, which really do not touch on security matters as such. I 
have sent this to each of your since your business units are those that have 
the most extensive operations in the developing countries in which these 
issues are of primary concern.  (I am separately collecting comments/concerns 
from within EES and EECC.)

The Enron effort on this guideline project has been lead by Lauren Goldblatt 
of the Corp. PR group. Lauren has run the attached drafts past Mike Hicks and 
Pete Vandergam at Corp. Security for their views of whether this can be 
implemented by Enron.  We as the legal department have been asked to express 
our view on are the following:

(a) Are there any show stoppers that would argue that Enron should not 
publicly express its "endorsement" of these polices?
(b) If Enron were to express its endorsement of the policy statement, what if 
any material problems do you think your business line might encounter in 
implementing the policy?
(c) Do you see any unintended practical or legal consequences that might 
arise from Enron publicly adopting or endorsing this as policy?

Please take an hour few hours to read through the materials, or have one of 
your lawyers do so. You might need to consult with your operation personnel 
for their practical views as well.   I would be grateful if you could express 
any concerns you may see with the guidelines by November 7 (Wednesday) so 
that I can coordinate comments and get the responses out.   (The deadline for 
Enron and other companies to express their endorsement of the policy has been 
extended from the November 8 deadline expressed in the attached to November 
15. To allow time for Enron to deal with responses, we have been asked to get 
our feed back to Lauren by November 8 (Thursday).)

You cane-mail your comments or phone them to  me at 713-646-6309. If I get 
suffucient expressions of interest for a conference call by Monday, I will 
set up a call in number for Wednesday morning US. 

Thanks, I appreciate your views and comments.

John, Rob and I have talked and   Rob would like you to take the lead on 
this.  Deborah, I need you to work  with  John S. to see how our 
international EES business (Europe, Mexico, etc.) might be   affected by this 
and whether we take this position.  I am sure Rob and JOhn will  have the 
history and expert opinion as to how this should be handled, and my guess is, 
this issue primarily affects EECC at this time.  Maybe one of the Apache 
lawyers can take the lead for the traditional EES business.   Rob will be in 
next week and then going out of town and I will pick up for him then.

Rob and Vicki:

Over the past few months we have participated in an initiative aimed at 
developing a voluntary set of guidelines governing human rights and security 
arrangements.   I would greatly appreciate your thoughts, review, and sign 
off on the guidelines.  

Should we agree to endorse the principles, we must send a letter to the U.S. 
State Department by November 8, 2000.     I have attached a fact sheet as 
well as the revised principles for your review.   

The principles and signatories will be announced by Madeline Albright and 
Secretary Robin Cook in November. 

Thank you for time and consideration on this.  Please do not hesitate to call 
with any questions.  I can be reached either by cell phone (917) 821-0724 or 
by  voicemail at 212-702-3916.

Best Regards,

		 Subject: Commodities Legislation

Mark:  just a "heads up" that we may be called to react to this attached 
NYMERX press release since Enron added the provisions they oppose in the 
release.  H.R. 4541 passed the House 377-4 last evening and Enron strongly 
supports the legislation (I will e-mail Ken Lay's letter to Chairman Combest 
which expresses our support plus some talking points for your information.)  
There is a real opportunity to enact this legislation this Congress.  The 
last deal which needs to be cut is with Senator Gramm (he is the only 
obstacle to enactment in the Senate.)  The "Energy Provisions" discussed in 
this press release are NOT IN PLAY and will not be changed in the Senate.  It 
is other provisions which do not directly affect Enron which are being 
negotiated.

Contrary to this release's statement, no House member (other than one member 
who didn't make it for the vote,Congressman Baker) is asking for changes in 
the Senate.  The overwhelming numbers speak for themselves.  All and all, 
this press release is outlandish.

This will be our highest priority next week and changes occur by the hour.  
Please call if you do indeed get press calls and need our assistance.  Many 
thanks.


EXCHANGE EXPRESSES OUTRAGE AT HOUSE PASSAGE OF H.R. 4541

NEW YORK, NY, October 20, 2000 -- In response to passage by the House of
Representatives last night of H.R. 4541, the Commodity Futures
Modernization Act of 2000, New York Mercantile Exchange Chairman Daniel
Rappaport issued the following statement:

      The New York Mercantile Exchange finds it particularly egregious
that, by approving subsection (g) (3) of Section 106, the House would
not only remove the energy and metals marketplaces from public scrutiny
and regulatory oversight, but also do this in a fashion that
discriminates between established markets versus start-up electronic
forums.

It is particularly outrageous, at a time when every U.S. consumer is
feeling the impact of high energy prices, to allow lobbying by a small
group of vested interests to influence Congress to take these markets
out of the public eye and create an advantage for people to trade on
private, proprietary systems lacking the protections of a neutral
self-regulatory organization. Policy makers, regulators, and the
American public will be deprived of currently available information on
market participation, concentration, and financial performance.

This is not only a matter of ill-conceived public policy but is also
anti-competitive and directly contrary to the recommendations made by
the President'sWorking Group on financial markets.

Even House members who voted in favor of the bill have been publicly
quoted as saying that it must be changed in the Senate.

The New York Mercantile Exchange plans to fight adamantly at the Senate
level to demand that this subsection either be eliminated or be amended
to create a consistent regulatory policy for electronic and open outcry
markets.

Alison:

I think the energy panel at the AGM on March 17, 2000 in Amsterdam should 
discuss (i) development of energy trading on the continent, (ii) energy 
documentation issues and (iii) regulatory barriers to energy trading.  This 
is a great time to do a panel on energy trading in Europe!  I will copy Paul 
and Justin in London to get their ideas on both topics and panel members.  
Perhaps we can have a conference call next week.

Guys, attached you will find a preliminary agenda for the 2000 ENA Offsite.  
As leaders of the organization, you have been invited to participate in a two 
day offsite where business 2001 objectives and strategies for ENA will be 
discussed.  It is scheduled to occur December 14th and 15th at the Venetian 
in Las Vegas.

This is the forum to ensure that your point of view and ideas can be heard 
and incorporated into our plans and iniatives as such I would encourage 
everyone to attend and to stay for the entire period.  In particular, we 
would like everyone to stay over Friday night and leave Saturday morning.

ENA public relations (Dorie) will manage all the logistics including air fare.

Final invitations, details and agenda will follow shortly.



Regards
Dave and John

I appreciate the request, but have never given the slides I use out in 
electronic form.  To do that we would need to have very detailed 
conversations about how they would be used.  Give me a call if you still want 
to talk about it.

The 9th Circuit of the U.S. Ct. of Appeals granted EES' request to stay an 
injunction granted by the District Court in the UCS litigation, which would 
have required EES to continue to directly serve UCS.  The stay allows EES to 
return the customer UCS to PG&E and SCE for utility service and thereby save 
the future accrual of an additional $144 million of negative CTC 
receivables.  In approximately two months, the 9th Circuit will conduct a 
further review of the stay.  It is likely EES' service contract with USC will 
expire before any trial at the District Court.

Mark:  I had a request from Doug Hawes as to whether there might be a senior 
Enron commercial person in France that he could make contract with regarding 
a project he is working on (see attached e-mail).  Since I know that France 
falls within your "world," I thought you might have a good feeling for who 
Doug might be able to contact.  If you are ok with Doug making such a contact 
and you could perhaps suggest a person Doug could call, I know that Doug 
would be greatly appreciative.

Thanks, Mark.  I'm sure we will be speaking soon with everything that is 
going on.  John

John:  I know you are busy, but when you get a chance could you let me know 
if you think you could get me an introduction to the Head Enron person in 
France assuming there is one.  The reason is I am working with a very 
successful LBO firm of medium size by French standards.  The project is in 
the process of being defined, but it is essentially a web site that brings 
together a number of elements of the energy field including electricity, gas 
and petroleum.  I would like to find out what the Enron person thinks is 
available and what is not available that would be useful.  It might be that 
Enron would want to participate in some fashion eventually, but the contact 
would not be about that.  It does not matter if it is an English or a French 
speaker.  Perhaps they run their presumably modest operation out of some 
other place like London.  I would be happy to go wherever the person is.  By 
the way, did you see the article in this week's EUW that says there is going 
to be an electricity trading market in France starting in May?  Because of 
EDF's expansion ambitions elsewhere especially in Europe they are beginning 
to get serious about opening up the market here.  Regards. Doug

		 Subject: E-Signature Protocol

Mark:

Pursuant to our discussion last week, below is a rough draft of a proposal 
for an electronic signature protocol, which could be presented to ISDA for 
further consideration and discussion after we have further discussed:

E-Signature Protocol

Objective: In light of the enactment of the US federal legislation on 
electronic signatures (effective as of 10/1/00), a simple, reliable, and 
enforceable protocol should be established to facilitate the electronic 
execution of Master Agreements (and confirmations where required).  To 
facilitate the wider use of electronic contracts, this protocol could be 
endorsed by ISDA. Hopefully, it would become a standard that others would use 
for all types of contracts. Perhaps, if necessary or helpful, the adoption of 
the protocol could be done electronically by each party unilaterally agreeing 
to abide by it, possibly using the same type of approach ISDA used in 
connection with the introduction of the EMU currency a few years ago.  
Initially, the protocol would be primarily applicable to U.S. counterparties, 
but it could be expanded to non-U.S. counterparties as e-signature laws like 
the new U.S. law are enacted across the globe.

Basic Protocol:  By adopting the protocol, each counterparty would agree that 
the relevant agreement may be electronically signed by complying with the 
following steps:

1) The parties negotiate and agree on a final form the relevant agreement, 
and appoint one of the parties ("First Party") to prepare the document for 
electronic signature;

2) The First Party prepares the final form in the PDF format (e.g., the body 
of the text could not be modified) with the exception of the blank signature 
blocks for each party to be placed on the last page of the agreement;

3) An authorized signatory of the First Party electronically signs the 
agreement (Note: this electronic signature could be accomplished by 
inscribing an electronic handwritten signature or the signatory typing in 
his/her name and title in the blank signature block);

4) The agreement, as electronically signed by the First Party, is sent via 
electronic means (e.g., by e-mail) by the First Party to the other party 
("Second Party");

5) An authorized signatory of the Second Party  electronically signs the 
agreement (Note: this electronic signature could be accomplished by 
impressing an electronic handwritten signature or the signatory typing in 
his/her name and title in the signature block);

6) The agreement, as electronically signed by the Second Party, is sent via 
electronic means (e.g., by e-mail) by the Second Party to the First Party, 
accordingly, creating the fully executed agreement; and

7) Each party would be responsible for maintaining in its own electronic 
archives the agreement as electronically signed by the parties.

Also, the following could be considered: (a) adding to the protocol that each 
party,by adopting the protocol, agrees to be bound by any agreement entered 
into by means of the protocol, and any other appropriate language to enhance 
the enforceability of the "e-signature" process and (b) adding to the 
preprinted form of the Master Agreement, a provision whereby each party 
adopts the electronic signature protocol endorsed by ISDA as in effect from 
time to time.

Mark, I would be happy to discuss this draft proposal with you further at 
your convenience.



Regards, Alan

Mark -

I thought that I would keep you informed of major decisions or analysis on 
Dahbol from time to time.

I was pleased to see the quality of our lawyers in India.  I think that it is 
a solid internal team and we will be relying on the same external lawyers 
that we have used throughout the life of the project.

Subject: Dahbol - PPA and Permits/Approvals Compliance

Rebecca/Jim -

The India legal team has completed two important reviews:

Permits/Approvals Review.  Sandeep Katwala led a group reviewing our permits 
and approvals.  They feel pretty good about our compliance with these 
permits/approvals.  As you have heard on previous phone calls, the day tank 
seepage some time ago makes us the most nervous.  It seems to us that a 
release from the site resulting in substantial groundwater contamination 
plays pretty well in the court of public opinion given DPC's failure to "come 
forward" on the issue (even though it was advised at the time of the release 
that it had no legal obligation to do so).  Sandeep's note is below.

PPA Review.  Paul Kraske led a group reviewing the PPA.  His memo on this 
issue is also below.  He feels pretty good about our ongoing compliance with 
the PPA.  The instances of the non-compliance are not particularly material 
and none would appear to play well in the court of public opinion.  I should 
also note that it would be very difficult for MSEB to lawfully terminate the 
PPA -- that remedy is not readily available to MSEB under the PPA terms.

Both review efforts have relied somewhat on the representations of DPC 
personnel.  The India legal team was able to "tie down" many significant 
issues with written documentation but in many cases have relied on the oral 
representations of our own employees to confirm compliance with our 
obligations.

There are a number of other legal review efforts underway and I will keep you 
apprised as these reviews progress.

Subject: Re: PPA Compliance - Attorney Client Priviledged  

Bruce,
Lauren, Narayan and Kunal have completed their review of DPC compliance with 
clearances. Based on discussions with DPC personnel and a review of 
correspondence where relevant, no material non-compliance issues have 
surfaced which I feel would pose a problem under the PPA. There are two 
instances under the Reserve Bank of India approvals DPC has failed to submit 
reports to the Ministry of Finance within the time frame indicated; these are 
however minor issues. We have to accept that there may be practical instances 
where there may not be strict compliance at the site (eg the actual 
construction of physical assets is not strictly as per the layout approved by 
the authorities) but, from the discussions with DPC personnel none of these 
have come to light. On the environment approvals DPC has submitted compliance 
statements to the Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board which confirm 
that DPC is in compliance with the conditions in the relevant approvals. We 
have relied on these statements as being accurate. 

With respect to the water pollution issue, as we saw on Saturday, DPC has 
notified MPCB pursuant to the show cause notice of the measures taken to 
mitigate the pollution off the site. That correspondence seemed to indicate 
that there should be no further problems with this issue. However, my sense 
is that we have not seen the end of this issue and in particular, the report 
currently being prepared by GSDA has not yet surfaced in final form. There is 
no guarantee that it will be positive. Shobhan's view that it is difficult to 
see how a Court would support an injunction of some sort shutting down the 
plant "permanently" given the remedial measures taken by DPC is persuasive - 
you can however see that it provides excellent ammunition for PR purposes.

What is your global strategy? How will you implement it?

Global eCommerce Law & Business Report can help net market makers answer
these questions with rich monthly analyses of legal and regulatory issues,
best business practices, and the barriers and opportunities that exist in
regions around the world. In our latest issue, for example, we provide a
detailed evaluation of content regulation, privacy, electronic signatures,
and consumer regulation which e-commerce marketers in Japan must consider.
Next month, look for a review of the regulatory environment in China.

Also in the current issue, a senior analyst at the Yankee Group explores
Latin America's fast growing Internet market, which is expected to more
than double by 2003. Venture capital funds are funneling billions of
dollars into enterprises in the region, and global players like Microsoft,
AOL, and Telefonica of Spain are making substantial acquisitions. Is this a
market you should be in?

As net markets build liquidity and seek to add value, globalization becomes
an increasingly important component of many business models. Global
eCommerce will help you stay ahead of the curve.

Thanks for your comments.  I think it would be a good idea to have Jon on as 
well.  I will add Jon and Marcus to the list.  Please let them know as 
appropriate.

Mark,

thanks for the note. 

>From the European perspective, I think the LC grouping makes sense. I think 
you definitely want Marcus on the call: Marcus will be heading all our non-UK 
European gas and power trading operations and so will be key going forward. 

Query whether you want Jon Chapman on the calls. Jon will not be doing any 
trading work but will doing the European assets work, akin to Bruce's group.

Subject: Staff Meetings

I propose that we continue to alternate the Office of General Counsel ("OGC") 
and Legal Committee ("LC") meetings of Enron Wholesale Services on Monday 
mornings at 8:30 am, Houston time.  The OGC and the LC would have the 
following members:
       
  OGC     LC
 Alan Aronowitz     OGC
 Mark Evans     Justin Boyd
 Barbara Gray     Michelle Cash
 Jeff Hodge     Steven Douglas
 Bruce Lundstrom    Peter Keohane
 Travis McCullough    John Novak
 Julia Murray     [Marcus Von Bock und Polach?]
 Elizabeth Sager     Dan Rogers
 Richard Sanders    Paul Simons
 Lance Schuler
 Mark Taylor
 Sheila Tweed
 Randy Young
 
Please give me your comments.  It is anticipated that we will continue to 
adjust the membership of both groups as the businesses continue to change.  I 
plan to address the policy committee in February.

Please start working on a top ten legal risks list.  I want to include that 
list for each of your companies (EGM, EIM and ENW) in the monthly report.  
This list should be in bullet format.  If you have any questions, please give

On November 8, the Office of the Chairman, issued an important communicatio=

are underway to restructure  Enron=01,s operations in South America.  The b=
asic=20
organizational framework has been set.=20

As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new=

responsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and=
=20
Joe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting=

be on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overal=

country management.  In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CE=
O=20
of Elektro until its ultimate sale.

The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding=20
Elektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in=
=20
Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark=
=20
Frevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil a=
nd=20
Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our=
=20
reputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being=20
managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these asset=
s=20
are pursued.

The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South=20
America will be organized around the highly successful North American netwo=
rk=20
business model.  This model employs people, market making, physical=20
commodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-valu=
e=20
products to our customers.  It is people and intellectual capital based and=
=20
enjoys high rates of return on invested capital.

In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report =
to=20
Joe and Orlando:
=20
The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.  The team will=
 =20
focus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine=
=20
natural gas and electricity, with the following goals:

? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services=
=20
needed by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital=20
capabilities;
? Providing those products and services across South America and across the=
=20
value chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value=

opportunity;
? Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move=

? Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the=20
overall risk of the organization;
? Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South Ameri=
ca=20
consistent with this strategy, and
? Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization information and de=

The Commercial Origination team will consist of a diverse group of people w=

work as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity,=
=20
capital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal executio=
n,=20
finance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals.=20

The Trading and Risk Management team will be headed by Remi Collonges.  The=

for the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sale=
s=20
efforts.  Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of activel=

=20
for managing Enron South America=01,s overall risk and will have a direct=
=20
reporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americ=
as=20
risk activities.

The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American=20
Commercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we=

will continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero. =

The goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organizati=

that is very market and commercially focused.  The following support=20
functions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial tea=

well as manage day-to-day business and risk.  Otherwise, the Houston=20
infrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements=

in South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas.

These groups include:

The Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will=20

Dear Terry:

Thanks for your quick reply.  Wednesday at 2 PM works for me.  I would be 
happy to come to IBJ's offices.  I will be joined by two others on our team.  
I would propose to discuss the prospects and challenges for energy trading in 
Japan.  Let me know if this is OK with you.   Look foward to seeing you.

Regards,

Mark

We should include ISDA energy definitions, CFTC matters re energy and an 
overview of power deregulation developments in North America.  I might also 
add a few items about international developments and the EEI physical power 
trading form.  I am thinking 4 slides at the most.  Is that what you want?

Mark:

We have recently been talking to a gentleman named Ed Straub at Duke.  I'll
see if I can push him perhaps by telling them they can speak in Houston if
they join up?

I also spoke with Constellation Energy today and they are serious about
joining as a Primary.  I might even be able to have their application by
next week's Board meeting.

Sorry if I asked you this before, but do you or anyone at Enron know Powder
Horn Petroleum Company out of Tulsa, OK?  They have applied as a Subscriber.

Thanks.

I am actively pursuing have Duke Energy become an ISDA member this month.
We are very interested in supporting the effort you mentioned at the
October meeting to begin developing one universal master energy trading
form.  Please keep me informed of future meetings, to insure our active
participation as this effort develops.  Thanks.

Mark- were you aware of this? Not a huge dollar  amount but does indicate a 
naked risk we didn't know we had (I think). Rick

Subject: Cypress Exploration Program - Operator/Cash Call Issue


	

Rick:  I wanted to inform you about a situation where a Commercial Team has 
subjected Enron to some material risk that did not get appropriate 
approval.               

 Here's the story:   On October 30, I received a funding request for my 
approval of approximately $260,000 representing a cash advance request on  
the Bernard No. 1 well, a 16,500 exploratory well in the Cypress Program.   
The request appeared pretty routine but as is our procedure, I had Don 
Rollins check it out .   Don discovered that we had already paid our cash 
call and this cash call represented our working interest partner, Kelley 
Oil's share, which is a highly unusual situation.  Checking further we 
discovered that  the well is being drilled under a farmout agreement from 
Kelley, who wanted to be operator.  Our guys (Thompson/Josey) wanted Enron 
(not Kelley)  to operate the well during the drilling phase but did not want 
to be official operator of record so they set up Rozel Onshore, our prospect 
generator in Lafayette to be our surrogate operator.  Kelley was upset about 
this and would not sign the Joint Venture Agreement unless the cash call 
provisons were deleted.  Thompson/Josey and team agreed and signed the 
agreement which has no initials from the Legal Department.   The effect of 
this was that Rozel/Enron would have to incur all the costs then bill and 
collect from Kelley.

Rick, as you are aware, the cash call provision in a JOA is the primary 
credit risk mitigant that an operator has to ensure that his partners pay 
their share of well costs before costs are incurred.  This can be 
particularly good protection if a well gets in trouble with lots of cost 
overruns that partners don't  want to pay.  In this case, our surrogate 
operator, Rozel has no established credit with oil service companys and no 
money of his own so all services including the drilling rig are having to be 
prepaid by Enron 100%.  The well is heavily front end loaded with costs with 
a total drill and complete exposure of over $4.0 million (if thing go ok!)

I discussed this with Dave Gorte and Brad Larson and we all agreed  that we 
are forced to fund since the well is drilling and failure to fund would shut 
down operations.   Also, keep in mind that this will be an ongoing obligation 
(and risk exposure) during this entire drilling phase.

Lessons Learned:
   1) The E&P merchant finance team has no business operating a deep S. 
Louisiana exploratory test.
   2)  Important provisions, like "cash call" should never be given away 
without appropriate risk assessment and approval.

Please call if you have questions.

In reviewing the contracts, so far I have the following questions:

1.     Have Oman LNG and ADgas taken the risk of non-performance by DPC and 
indirectly MSEB without any credit support?  The only security is the equity 
in DPC?  Are such contracts typically secured or done with a buyer with deep 
pockets?  How much value was put into DPC by the shareholders?

2.     Are there local public policy issues that could be addressed by local 
courts with respect to the LNG contracts?  Fraud?  Bribery?  Are there any 
local law issues with respect to performance or interpretation of the 
contracts?  Isn't take-or-pay meaningless without credit support?

3.     What are the arguments for DPC to terminate the contracts?  Only where 
the PPA is terminated?  Payments?

4.    Who negotiated the contracts?  Were there requests for credit support?  
>From Enron?  Did Enron ever promise to indirectly "backstop" the contracts by 
its investment in Dabhol?

5.   What was the discussion regarding the "reduction in operational 
capability" language in the contracts?  What was the language meant to 
cover?  Do we need our counterparty's approval to investigate other markets?

6.   Is there any argument that DPC has already breached the contracts?  
Could our counterparties issue a press release claiming damages over the 
entire term of the contract? Confidentiality and press releases?

		 Subject: El Paso Arbitration

After our discussion this afternoon, I have given some additional thought -- 
and talked to outside counsel -- about the negative potential consequences of 
filing an arbitration against El Paso.  While I think we should accept the 
risks, here they are all from our vantage point:

First, El Paso could move the Swap Agreements from EPME and claim
the Guaranty Agreements do not follow.  

Second, we could lose on our claims.  This would give El Paso the right to 
move the Swap Agreements from EPME and claim the Guaranty Agreements do not 
follow. 

Third, El Paso could fight us on the arbitrability of the Guaranty
Agreement claim.  We could end up with two proceedings -- our arbitration and
a court proceeding El Paso initiates on the Guaranty Agreement claim.
Unfortunately, El Paso would have the opportunity to choose the forum on the
Guaranty Agreement claim.

Fourth, El Paso could counterclaim on the breach of the confidentiality
provision.  I think they would have a good argument that we have breached
that provision by showing the Swap Agreements etc. to people outside the
company such as our bankers.  I am not clear what damages they could claim
based on that alleged breach.

I haven't heard anything to suggest there are other claims out there for El
Paso to assert, but we haven't done much investigating in that area either.
I suppose if El Paso got really mad, they might look back over the 
negotiations in this deal and others to see if they have any other claims 
they could construct.

The volume and complexity of our legal work has increased dramatically over

devoted to legal planning and review in order to provide the best possible 
service to our clients.  Within the next month, I have asked Janette to 
schedule a Quarterly Legal Review for each group listed on our new 
organizational chart .  I  would envision that we would focus on the 
following:  

review of the current monthly legal report and significant legal issues
review of the top ten legal risks
form contracts and other documentation projects
legal budget
legal resources, inside and outside
performance metrics

In addition, I am proposing that any energy trading contract for a term 
longer than one year by initialled by an AGC or member of the OGC.  Let me 
know what you think about that.

		 Subject: Re: Financial Trading in Brazil

Mark;

The Brazilian Central Bank created a structure of access to the interest 
rate, currency and commodity swaps international market that is based on 3 
main points as follows:

payments and receipts arising from hedging modes  (trading on the offshore 
stock market as well as on the forward, futures and option markets) as well 
as remittances to or from abroad inherent to these transactions (spread, 
commissions, premiums and so on) will be effected in foreign currency upon 
prompt closing of exchange on the commercial exchange market;
remittances intended for the opening of current accounts with brokerage 
companies abroad as well as for deposits of collateral margins are permitted; 
and
upon preliminary approval by the Central Bank, remittances abroad intended 
for collateral and escrow deposits linked to interest rate and currency swaps 
can be effected.

The key issue of this structure is that the income tax on remittances to 
overseas that can be demonstrated to be remittances usual, normal and 
necessary for hedging transactions on the international market can be reduced 
by 100%.  In addition to any positive results for the foreign institutions 
from these operations, the spread, commissions, premiums, and other related 
sums. when remitted abroad, will not be subject to any income tax 
withholdings.  With respect to the tax treatment of losses that Brazilian 
companies may incur as a result of hedging operations, such losses may be 
deductible for the purpose of determining taxable profits, only in the event 
that they occur in investments on exchanges abroad.  If these transactions 
are not carried out on such exchanges, the losses will not be deductible when 
determining the taxable profits.

Brazilian entities are not prevented to enter into swap or other derivative 
transactions on the international market in case they do not meet the 
requirements established above.  The consequences, however, will be the 
following:

payments and receipts arising from such transactions as well as remittances 
to or from abroad inherent to these transactions could not be effected in 
foreign currency upon prompt closing of exchange on the commercial exchange 
market, but only through mechanisms available in the or related to the 
floating (or "tourism") exchange rate;
the inflow of foreign currency through the floating rate market would be 
subject to IOF (tax on financial transactions) assessed at the rate of 2% on 
the Brazilian currency equivalent of the foreign funds entering Brazil;
remittance of any amounts that are considered income of a foreign resident 
shall be subject to withholding income tax at 15% or at a reduced rate if the 
creditor is domiciled in a country  with which Brazil has entered into a 
double taxation treaty .

To the best of my knowledge, you will appreciate that the ISDA Master 
Agreement has been widely used by foreign swap dealers with Brazilian 
counterparties.

Rgds,

Sami

I think we say we want the facility to be revenue enhancing and that we are

Subject: 

In light of the transition of the risk books to ENA, I need your input on 
whether we (EES) should continue to pursue our own master contracts with new 
trading partners.  In certain instances, ENA already has a master in place 
with the counterparty or in other instances (TransCanada Energy Marketing 
USA, Inc. & Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation), ENA Legal is currently 
negotiating a separate master with the counterparty.

The Gas Desk is pressing hard for a number of new masters with additional 
counterparties.  While we are set up to handle their requests, in light of 
the organization changes, it seems this may be unnecessary.  Even where ENA 
does not currently have or is not currently negotiating a master, they may 
prefer that the document be handled by ENA legal and avoid having to assign 
the master to them at a later date.    I would like to have your thoughts 
before I commit resources to handle these requests.

If you prefer that we continue to pursue these new master, we have the 
resources available to proceed.

 Jim

Subject: CDWR  


Steve:

The CDWR idea has already been implemented. Today the ISO couldn't get supply 
from the market and informed market participants that CDWR would sleeve deals 
to the ISO. This occurred at a time when CA was in Stage 3 emergency (only 
the second one ever) and anticipating rolling blackouts this evening. Enron 
and other suppliers began to aggregate supply to sell to CDWR presumably to 
go to the ISO.  Belden was concerned that Gray Davis may just withhold 
payment through CDWR when settlements are due. This concern prompted us to 
require paper confirms for hourly deals and a discussion between Christian 
Yoder and Steve Hall (Stoel Rives) with the assistant director at CDWR to 
make sure CDWR management was on board - which they confirmed verbally. 
Regardless of all of this we still have some paranoia about getting paid. Is 
Gray Davis willing to confirm that no payment issue through CDWR will occur? 
We are currently continuing to aggregate supply through the day but are 
hesitant to increase quantities without such assurance. Other suppliers 
appeared hesitant as well as they wouldn't sleeve the deals to CDWR.

We have purchased 30 copies of the referenced book.  It is a short read -- 
about 30-45 minutes.  The copies are located at the clerks' station, EB3808.  
Please read this short story prior to our ENA Legal Conference and then 
return it to the clerks' station so everyone attending the conference will 
have an opportunity to read it prior to the conference.

I will be over for the ISDA board meeting on January 25 and 26.  With the 
launch of the credit derivatives business, I think it would be a good time to 
do a brief Securities Law/Chinese Wall seminar relating to the credit 
business.  I would propose to review the rules we have instituted in NA and 
particular issues in the European market.  My preference on timing is in the 
morning on the 26th, and second, in the afternoon on the 25th.  Please give 
your thoughts on this.  Take care.

I am ok with your slate, but need some Houston people on board as well.  I 
think we can shorten the Houston list by taking me off since John Novak will 
be on the board.  I leave it to Bruce to see if it makes sense to shorten the 
list further.  Mark

finalize before the next ordinary shareholder meeting in Brazil.   Thanks

See attached regarding Elektro's board membership.  We would suggest that the 
board slate be made up of Brazil residents in order to facilitate the 
necessary meetings. I would like to include Joe Kishkill, John Novak, Brett 
Wiggs, Britaldo Soares and Joao Carlos Albuquerque, all members of our 
executive committee to substitute Rick Waddell, Diomedes, Jim Bannantine, and 
Rick Lammers.  If  you agree, I will talk to Rebecca to finalize.  Thanks

Subject: Enron Global Assets Board Slates

Folks -

The Legal Specialists in EGA are working up new director/officer slates for 
the EGA entities.  We will be appointing the following list of directors for 
EGA entities:  

Rebecca McDonald
Jim Hughes
Jeff Sommers
Jim Derrick
Mark Haedicke

There will be some exceptions to this slate, particularly where local law or 
the necessity of regular board attendance requires additional (or even 
different) directors to be appointed.  These will be considered on a 
case-by-case basis.  Allow the Legal Specialists the opportunity to come up 
with their tentative slates and then we will give them to the regional heads 
for comment.

Some of you will be asked to resign your current directorships.  I hope that 
no one will take offense to the fact of of the changed slates -- none is 
intended.  We have found that this common slate has made corporate governance 
more efficient and less complicated.

Thank you for your cooperation.  Please pass this message along to others in 
your respective groups as you deem necessary.

Bruce

To be elected as a Board member a person must be a shareholder of the Company 
(normally one share is transferred to such member) and tehre is no more the 
requirement of the Brazilian residency.
There is no other mandatory requirements.
However one has to have in mind that from a practical point of view it  is 
not viable to have only non residents at the Board (frequent trips to Brazil, 
less flexibility on timing to pass resolutions about ugent matters etc)  
Ideally at least trhee shoul be resident in Brazil (present minum quorum to 
held a Board Meeting.)

there other specific requirements?  I would like to send a proposal this

Subject:  Board Members


Orlando:
As per your request, please find bellow the names of all of the present
members of Elektro's Board.
Firstly is to be mentioned that according to Elektro's By Laws, the Board may 
have a minimum of 4 and a
maximum of 7 permanent members (one obligatorily must be elected by
appointment of Elektros' employees) and a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 4
alternates (one obligatorily to act solely as alternate to the employees'
representative at the Board)

Permanent members:
Diomedes Christodoulou (President)
Orlando Goanz?lez
Ricky Linn Waddell
Geraldo Gon?alves Pereira (elected by appointment of Elektro's employees)
Vacant (3)
Alternate members:
James Martin Bannantine
Richard Allan Lammers
Ricardo Louren?o Carneiro (alternate to Geraldo Gon?alves)
Vacant (3)

The election and/or dismissal of the Board members has to be decided by the
shareholders of the company.
Normally the election o the Board members takes place at the annual
Ordinary Shareholder's meeting. (This year, our OGM is scheduled to take
place on April, 29th.)
However this matter  can also be decided at any time via an Extraordinary
Shareholder's Meeting  that has to be called trough a  Board Resolution
that  has to be publicized at the Official Gazette no later than 8 days
prior to date of such EGM.
Should the present number of the Board members be maintained (i.e 4
permanent and 3 alternates), the election of new members (from our side)
will have to be made upon the resignation of those presently on seat.
Should you deem necessary, please call me at your earliest convenience.
Least but nol east As I vave mentined to you the other day, it is quite 
normal to appoint the senior legal council as an alternate to the permanent 
members of the Board so that he may legally be present at all the board 
meetings

Although I know there are specific circumstances for Entergy and Southern's 
case (inadequate corp. guarantee language in the master agreements), I echo 
Rogers comments.  We must resolve these issues quickly.

In order to make the P&L and EOL targets that Lavo and Delainey have imposed 
on East Power for 4th qtr 2000 and calender year 2001, we must be able to 
transact with all load serving utilities and all merchant marketing shops.  
We are agressively making markets in all regions in an effort to build 
liquidity, and it is imperative to remove encumberances.

Bill Bradford & Elizabeth Sager,
Please place a high priority on cleaning up our "paper" with these 
counterparties so my traders can make markets and transact freely.

Thanks.

Gail
I have mentioned to you today by telephone about our  discussions with
ANEEL regarding  the automatic  passthrough of taxes and legal
encumbrances, including a legal opinion we have obtained from Sergio
Bermudes/Marcelo Ferro law firm in relation to this subject.
Orlando and Sergio Assad are about to gave me their clearance to start a
legal suit against ANEEL having in view its refusal to grant to Elektro
such passthrough.
It is my opinion that this case should be handled by Bermudes.
Do you know if  Bermudes is authorized by Enron to represent us as one of
our litigation law firms? If notI would apreciate your help to obtain such
authorization.
Bermudes is a very well known litigation lawyer with a sound reputation in
Brazil and abroad.
Attached you will find his legal opinion I referred above.
Sergio Bermudes / Marcelo Ferro CVs in  English can be reached in the
internet at the following address:  www.sbadv.com.br 
Kind regards
Vasco.

John;

I am hoping to close a PPA with CSN on Friday.  The nominal value of the deal 
is approximately US$6million for a 13-month term.  I am fighting to get 
ICC-administered arbitration in Brazil as a dispute resolution mechanism.  
CSN insists on MAE mediation & local courts (which is unacceptable to us).  
In case we reach an agreement, can I go ahead with arbitration in Brazil ?  
Have you talked to Michelle Blaine or Mark Headicke yet ?

Tks,

Sami

		 Subject: DealBench/Freshfields Proposal

Attached please find an outline of a proposal for a business relationship 
between DealBench and Freshfields.   Rob, Jordan and I have been considering 
this from a legal relationships perspective and request your thoughts on 
same.  

Tobias Munk of DealBench has been working on developing this 
DealBench/Freshfields relationship for a couple of months.  Tobias came to 
DealBench from Enron London to help develop a capability to do due diligence 
on the DealBench platform (the dataroom product).  He initiated contact with 
Freshfields (Hugh Crisp) before moving to Houston.   DealBench has been aware 
that this relationship would be subject to approval by Enron legal management.

The proposed relationship essentially is a business referral one:  DealBench 
would pay Freshfields 10% of site license fees paid to DealBench by customers 
referred by Freshfields.  Freshfields also would provide up to 100 hours of 
consulting services regarding the dataroom product for no additional monetary 
consideration but DealBench would give Freshfields exclusive recognition for 
helping DealBench develop the dataroom product in Europe and Asia. DealBench 
advises that Freshfields believes it would benefit from the publicity 
associated with being part of the development of an e-commerce product.  The 
DealBench commercial team is very interested in moving forward with 
Freshfields.  Although Freshfields cannot guarantee any referrals, DealBench 
believes the relationship would be fruitful for it commercially because of 
Freshfields' prominence in M&A transactions in Europe and Asia. 

Before DealBench moves further with Freshfields, it would like legal 
clearance.  We look forward to hearing from you.

Michelle, I did not speak with Jim or Rob about this, so I am assuming that 
you did.  I think it is a good policy, although I am still not as convinced 
as Sami is that the courts in Brazil will so cavalierly disregard 
international arbitration provisions. Nevertheless, I think it was necessary 
to change our policy from a commercial perspective; we were getting too much 
resistance to foreign arbitration.  Now the question is, do we go the next 
step and see if Jim will approve submitting to the jurisdiction of some 
courts in Brazil which are generally reliable and free of corruption (e.g., 
Sao Paulo and Rio) if the counterparty rejects arbitration, and the largest 
sum of money that would ever be in dispute would be less than $500,000?  I 
think we will face that soon, so we may as well raise it now.

Effective immediately, trading contracts to be performed in Brazil between a

for arbitration in Sao Paulo using the ICC administration and rules, to be 
conducted in the English language as a first choice or English & Portuguese 
as a second choice.  Attached is the rationale for this exception to the 
policy favoring foreign arbitration and a model clause.  Legal will continue 
to monitor how the Brazilian courts react to arbitration both foreign and 
domestic and reevaluate the policy in 2002.  Please call Michelle Blaine if 
you have any questions.

1.  Conference call - Mark, Ruth and Stacy re: agenda for NA Energy
Committee
2.  Conference call - Mark, Ruth, Stacy, Christophe, Katia, John re:
coordination of committee activities and agenda for December conference

Depending upon your schedule, we hope to try to get these calls scheduled
either this week or early next week.

Many thanks!  -- Stacy

Subject: European Energy Committee Meeting


Hello Mark -- The European Energy Committee meeting was held in London
today. The attached documents, including the agenda, a memo on the Bridge
agreement, and a copy of the Bridge agreement, were reviewed at this
morning's meeting. 

Much of the discussion focused on explanation of the Bridge Agreement. There
was some discussion about the German regulatory structure and the bridge
agreement.  Katia ran through the agenda in Houston and asked for ideas on
December conference.  I was not able to hear all of the questions entirely
but questions were asked about the outcome of the meeting.  Katia and
Christophe explained that it was a forum to exchange ideas and to promote
use of ISDA within industry. The minutes should give us more detail.  

In addition to a call re: the NA agenda, I think it would be worthwhile to
also have a call w/Christophe, Katia and John Berry to discuss European
activities and to begin discussion on the December agenda. ISDA should begin
to focus on an agenda as soon as possible so that we assure December's
conference is as productive as the Houston conference.  Thanks!

Mark-as a result of the latest reorganization of Enron, there are a number
of projects that King & Spalding's Houston office is working on that now
fall within your area of responsibility.  I'd like to have the opportunity
to meet with you to explain what we are doing, and to bring you up to date
on the growth of our Houston office.  Would a meeting in the next week or so
fit your schedule?  My assistant (Carmen Schnur) keeps my calendar, so if
your assistant want to contact her to coordinate, that would work well.

I take this opportunity to wish you a Happy Thanksgiving.

Regards

Please let me know as soon as possible if you are aware of any such contracts 
as described below by Sharon Butcher.

"The U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting has 
advised that on May 25, 2001, they will evaluate Enron's subcontracting 
program and compliance on any subcontracting plans in effect on current 
contracts.

This review will cover the last five (5) years.  All Forms 294 and 295 filed 
with the Small Business Adminstration along with the names of each 
Administrative Contracting Officer (U.S. Government employee responsible for 
monitoring the contract) for each contract will be subject to the review.

In addition, total subcontract placement with small businesses, small 
disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, and HubZone small 
businesses shall be reviewed.  Further, the amount of indirect or overhead 
costs, if any, apportioned to contract goals is subject to review.

We will also need information on the number of active suppliers Enron is 
currently using in the following categories:  large business, small business, 
small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business and HubZone 
business.  The review will cover these figures for one year ago if available."

I propose that we continue to alternate the Office of General Counsel ("OGC") 
and Legal Committee ("LC") meetings of Enron Wholesale Services on Monday 
mornings at 8:30 am, Houston time.  The OGC and the LC would have the 
following members:
       
  OGC     LC
 Alan Aronowitz     OGC
 Mark Evans     Justin Boyd
 Barbara Gray     Michelle Cash
 Jeff Hodge     Steven Douglas
 Bruce Lundstrom    Peter Keohane
 Travis McCullough    John Novak
 Julia Murray     [Marcus Von Bock und Polach?]
 Elizabeth Sager     Dan Rogers
 Richard Sanders    Paul Simons
 Lance Schuler

Please give me your comments.  It is anticipated that we will continue to 
adjust the membership of both groups as the businesses continue to change.  I 
plan to address the policy committee in February.

Peter:

You are asking good questions.  Generally, most employees are part of ENA and 
provide services to all the wholesale businesses.  The executives tend to 
have their own company business cards and stationary.  But, most of the 
business continues under ENA or an existing company.  Occasionally, 
litigation concerns dictate not following the general rules.  You can get 
more specific info from Julia.

representatives of the Donahue Ernst & Young firm, Doug Black, Harold Huber

wondering about your availability to meet with them.  They have other 
meetings lined up on the 19th, but would be available, subject to your 
availability, later in the afternoon on March 19th or any time in the morning 
on March 20th.

Please let me know whether that works for either of you, and I will have Ron 
Deyholos then contact you directly to make firmer arrangements.

 It has become customary to prepare Unanimous Consents of Directors for many 
transactions even if such actions are not required by the relevant By-laws 
and/or Certificate of Incorporation.  Please consider carefully whether 
Unanimous Consents of Directors are necessary or appropriate in a particular 
transaction, i.e., the transaction is a significant transaction or evidence 
of authority is required for a legal opinion.  When in doubt, please review 
the By-laws and Certificate of Incorporation of the relevant entity and 
discuss the matter with a member of the Office of the General Counsel.

Thank you.

Do our Contract Administration folks (Carolyn Gilley, Mary Salmonson) work 
with these forms and contracts.  The only "small businesses" that I'm aware 
of are the various consulting firms and other service entities (law firms, 
recruiting firms) that we use.  We have a consulting agreement data base and 
also a data base of law firm engagement agreements.  Either Ed Hearn or Kay 
Young could help access these contracts.

Subcontracting Program

Please let me know as soon as possible if you are aware of any such contracts 
as described below by Sharon Butcher.

"The U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting has 
advised that on May 25, 2001, they will evaluate Enron's subcontracting 
program and compliance on any subcontracting plans in effect on current 
contracts.

This review will cover the last five (5) years.  All Forms 294 and 295 filed 
with the Small Business Adminstration along with the names of each 
Administrative Contracting Officer (U.S. Government employee responsible for 
monitoring the contract) for each contract will be subject to the review.

In addition, total subcontract placement with small businesses, small 
disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, and HubZone small 
businesses shall be reviewed.  Further, the amount of indirect or overhead 
costs, if any, apportioned to contract goals is subject to review.

We will also need information on the number of active suppliers Enron is 
currently using in the following categories:  large business, small business, 
small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business and HubZone 
business.  The review will cover these figures for one year ago if available."

I asked Mark T to give you a call.  Legal questions on the financial confirms 
should be handled in Canada as the first option and secondly go to Houston.  
Please talk it through with Mark T to make sure that all works.  Should you 
and Mark T talk it through with the confirm desk in Canada to make sure it is 
clear?

SENT ON BEHALF OF PETER KEOHANE:

Please see attached e-mail from Rob Milnthorp.  What I believe he is 
referring to is documentation of financial (gas or power transactions).  
(i.e. All physical transactions, Confirms, GTC's, Masters, etc. are 
documented out of Calgary, all with the proper controls.)  Honestly, I am not 
clear on this point.  My understanding is that responsibility for financial 
trading for Canada is with Mark Taylor.  i.e. I understand that Confirms 
which do not require legal input have been moved to the Confirm group in 
Calgary, but Confirms which require legal input, ISDA Masters with Canadian 
counterparties, structured financial transactions, etc. remain with Mark 
Taylor, and that Calgary Legal is not, generally speaking, responsible for 
financial transactions.  I do not want to re-visit this issue, but merely 
clarify any confusion so that I can get back to Milnthorp.  I know that 
neither Greg Johnston, Mark Powell, Chris Gaffney nor I are seeing any 
financial trades.

Regards,
Peter

Please find attached the form of physical power GTC that may be used in 
conjunction with confirms for power deals of less than one year in duration.  
This is the standard form so it does not address market opening delays or 
changes in law affecting pricing.  Any provisions required to address these 
risks will need to be built into the confirms themselves as "Other 
Provisions".

Tokyo because almost all the products being discussed so far are physical.  
What do you think?

Hi Mark,

There will be a one-day WRMA conference here (Morten Erik and Mark Tawney are 
involved in these arrangements and Mr. Wani, lawyer of local derivative fame 
will be talking at the conference) in late Feb or early March.  Date will be 
fixed later this week, likely to be March 5.

ISDA is planning an energy seminar in Tokyo in mid-May.  We have heard there 
may be an energy seminar in March or April in Tokyo.  Have you heard of the 
earlier seminar?  We are trying to decide whether it makes sense to go 
forward on the May seminar.  Could you look into this and talk to the traders.

Thanks for your help.

Issues: Denial of defense motion for a lineup; Prosecutorial misconduct
Court: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)
Case Name: People v. Cain
e-Journal Number: 8381
Judge(s): Per Curiam - Neff, Talbot, and Sullivan

The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant's=20
untimely motion for a lineup. An eyewitness testified that she was only an=
=20
arm's length away from defendant when she saw him "key" the complainant's=
=20
vehicle, then enter a business. The manager of the business, notified of th=
e=20
keying incident shortly after it occurred, testified that defendant was the=
=20
only person in the building lobby matching the perpetrator's description.=
=20
Although eyewitness identification was a material issue, a lineup would not=
=20
have resolved any "mistaken identification" in this case. The trial court=
=20
also properly considered the untimeliness of the motion, and the possible=
=20
hardship a delay for a lineup could have had on the eyewitness, who resided=
=20
in another state. Defendant's conviction of malicious destruction of proper=
ty=20
over $100 was affirmed.

Court: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)
Case Name: People v. Fordham
e-Journal Number: 8380
Judge(s): Per Curiam - Neff, Talbot, and Sullivan

Since both the victim and a police officer identified the defendant as the=

man who stole the victim's car and the trial court concluded that the victi=

intent
Court: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)
Case Name: People v. Moss
e-Journal Number: 8387
Judge(s): Per Curiam - Neff, Talbot, and Sullivan

The prosecution introduced sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact=
=20
to conclude that defendant acted willfully and maliciously, regardless of=
=20
whether he was intoxicated to some degree, when he set fire to the victims'=
=20
home. Even if defendant was drunk when arrested approximately 22 hours afte=
r=20
the fire, his intoxication did not bear any relation to his state of mind o=
n=20
the night of the fire. The testimony indicated that even if defendant was=
=20
intoxicated, he remained fully capable of entertaining the necessary specif=
ic=20
intent. The evidence established that (1) defendant appeared at the victims=
'=20
home three times and was there purposely prior to the fire, (2) defendant h=

no reported difficulty safely traveling to and from the victims' house, (3)=

defendant threatened the victims that he would return to harm them, and (4)=

defendant followed through with the threats later that night when he=20
purchased kerosene, transported it to the victims' home, poured it onto the=

There was insufficient evidence that defendant performed acts or gave=20

Issues: Suppression of defendant's inculpatory statements; Whether=20
interrogation was custodial; Whether defendant's statements were knowingly=
=20
and voluntarily made; Totality of the circumstances
Court: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)
Case Name: People v. Rose
e-Journal Number: 8385
Judge(s): Per Curiam - McDonald, Sawyer, and White

The trial court erred in suppressing defendant's statements to police on th=
e=20
basis that defendant was in custody and thus entitled to Miranda warnings=
=20
from the outset of the interview. Defendant agreed to speak with the police=
,=20
drove himself to the station, and was informed prior to the interview that =
he=20
was not under arrest and was free to leave. At no time was he told that he=
=20
was not free to leave, and the door was left open. The officer's failure to=
=20
tell defendant that he was being investigated for CSC did not alter the fac=
t=20
that defendant was told he was free to leave, or render the interview a=20
custodial one. Further, under the totality of the circumstances, defendant'=
s=20
statements were knowingly and voluntarily made, and were not the product of=
=20
psychological coercion. Defendant was 21-years old, had completed three yea=
rs=20
of college, and discerned the focus of the officer's inquiries soon after t=
he=20
interview began. The trial court's order suppressing defendant's statements=
=20
was reversed, and the case remanded for further proceedings.

Judge(s): Per Curiam - O'Connell, Kelly, and Whitbeck

Although the defendant argued that the prosecutor improperly referred to an=
=20
accomplice's plea agreement to bolster that witness' testimony, defendant d=
id=20
not show that he was prejudiced. The prosecutor did not engage in misconduc=
t=20
by eliciting testimony and arguing that the plea agreement required the=20

Court: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)
Case Name: Belgiorno v. Belgiorno

Case Name: Barden Detroit Casino, L.L.C. v. The City of Detroit
e-Journal Number: 8399
Judge(s): Nelson, Moore, and Wilhoit

The district court correctly dismissed plaintiff's suit against both the ci=
ty=20

no=20

ineffective, there could be no injury and no case or controversy against th=

=20
the mayor unequivocally testified that no preference was applied at any sta=

The trial court properly granted defendant-orthopedist summary disposition =

I think you pose an interesting legal issue.  I believe there is caselaw on 
this in the states.  We have a variation on this in some agreements in that 
if exposure exceeds x, then collateral must be posted.  I will be interested 
in the responses you get.

Regards,

Mark

		 Subject: Security under Master Agreements

Mark, Rob Milnthorp has asked me to consider whether there is an artful way 
under our Master Agreements that upon certain occurrences we could elevate 
our exposure from unsecured to secured, particularly in circumstances where, 
for whatever reason, we have not received letters of credit or other 
collateral.  My thought is to insert a clause in our Master Agreements in the 
nature of a "floating charge".

The problem with this concept is that it may be resisted within the 
industry.  For example, certain counterparties, i.e. a financial institution 
or a near-financial institution, such as a bank, a brokerage, a trading 
institution, etc., would not likely be willing to provide us with security 
over their assets.  In general, counterparties will also have concerns with 
granting security over their assets, particularly as that security may have 
restricting consequences for their treasury/banking relationships and 
covenants, and/or on their ability to conduct business, including disposing 
of assets which may then require our consent.  In addition, it would likely 
be necessary to introduce this concept on a bilateral basis, such that it 
would also be binding on us in similar circumstances.  (Counterparties could 
go so far as requiring this concept in our Enron Corp. guarantees.)

For example, in the natural gas business in Canada at least, older form 
marketing agreements and agreements used by gas aggregators with gas 
producers used "reserved dedication" covenants, whereby reserves were 
dedicated to a particular contract.  These covenants did not, however, create 
security, to avoid the complicating issues addressed above.  To the extent 
that the reserves were not available, the marketer/aggregator could have a 
claim, on an unsecured basis, for breach of covenant, but was not in a 
secured position.  I do not believe we want to go to this type of concept.

However, we may be able to think of some creative way whereby the 
counterparty is free to deal with us (and we are free to deal with them) on 
an unsecured basis, subject to our standard collateralization requirements, 
but also provide that upon the occurrence of a particularly serious event, 
such as a Material Adverse Change, a Triggering Event, an Event of Default, 
etc., the security automatically takes place.  We would need to consider 
whether such a "prospective" security interest could be made to work and be 
enforceable.

I have discussed this concept on a preliminary basis with Rob Milnthorp and 
Mungo Hardwicke-Brown of the Blake firm to see if we could create a 
relatively simple clause to be inserted into our Master Agreements which 
artfully deals with this issue.  In essence, the idea would be to get 
ourselves in a position of being one step ahead of all of the unsecured 
creditors in the event there is an insolvency.

Would you please let me know whether you think this is a worthwhile project 
or whether we have considered such a thing in the past in Houston.  As noted 
above, the clause would have to be one that could be "sold" to counterparties 
and be acceptable to us on a bilateral basis (and that may well not be 
possible).  If you believe that it is a worthwhile project, I will continue 
to work with Mungo Hardwicke-Brown to see if we can come up with something.  
If you do not believe that it is a worthwhile project or have considered this 
idea in the past and found it to be unworkable, please let me know, and we 
will not work on it further.

Regards,
Peter

Mark -

Are you free for lunch next week?  Breakfast or a beer after work would work 
as well.  

In my view, APACHI has a limited life span and I'd like to see what 
opportunities there still might be for the remaining lawyers/legal 
specialists in my group.

Thanks,

Mark:

I am writing in regards to ISDA's Energy and Developing Products conference
in Houston on March 6, 2001.  I have attached a copy of the agenda for your
information.
 <<Houston speaker agenda.2001.doc>>

We are now in the process of trying to find suitable speakers for the
conference.  I know Mary Cunningham had mentioned to you about inviting a
senior person from Enron to open the conference on the Overview of Energy
and Developing Markets from 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM.  We are concerned that if
Jeffrey Skilling spoke at the conference his participation would take away
our draw at the AGM in April.  We would be delighted to have you open the
conference unless you think we should invite a business speaker to give an
Overview of Energy and Developing Markets.

Should you have any questions, please call me at 212-332-2559.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Liz

		 Subject: Participation by Enron Canada in Private Placement of Impact Energy

Enron Canada plans to subscribe to a private placement of common shares in 
Impact Energy Inc. as a merchant equity investment, which private placement 
is closing tomorrow. The acquisition will be made pursuant to a standard long 
form subscription agreement.  Impact Energy is a publicly traded Canadian 
junior oil and gas company (trades on the TSE under the symbol TEY), which 
resulted from the reorganization of Startech Energy by and with ARC Energy in 
January 2001.  Kyle plans on subscribing for 545,455 common shares at a price 
per share of CDN$0.55, for total consideration of $300,000.25.  Under 
Canadian securities legislation, there will be a hold period imposed on the 
shares of one year from the date of issuance of the shares, meaning that 
Enron Canada will be prevented from reselling the shares in the open market 
for one year, unless it resells them pursuant to another exemption from the 
prospectus requirements available under such securities legislation.  Enron 
Canada previously obtained shares in Impact as part of the plan of 
arrangement involving Startech and ARC.

Should you require anything further, please either contact myself at 
403-974-6745 or Derek Lynn at 403-974-6719.

Enclosed please find redlined and clean copies of the versions of Executive 
Summary and Policies and Procedure that we plan on posting on LegalOnline.  
The most recent revisions reflect the newly announced Enron Wholesale 
Services organizational structure.  There are still a few unanswered 
questions relating to the EWS structure -- such as whether EWS will be an 
actual entity or simply an unincorporated "umbrella" of certain businesses.  
In large part, the revisions are simply more flexible versions of old 
language in light of these unanswered questions.  I would not say that any of 
the revisions amount to substantive changes to the policy.

Please contact me with any comments or questions you may have regarding the 
enclosed; however, please also keep in mind that we are on a very critical 
path towards the scheduled roll-out of LegalOnline.  In that regard, it would 
be greatly appreciated if any requested revisions could be made no later than 
Wednesday, Nov. 29.  Thanks -- Bob

Mark:
    Following up on the suggestion from Al Alexanderson that you were
expecting "a phone call and a resume" from me, I am sending you my resume as
a Word document attachment to this note. I presume that you are in fact
looking for a lawyer as Al described.  I'm not going to go into any detail in
this note, but if you are looking, we should talk.  I have extensive
experience in both transactional and regulatory aspects of energy practice.
As Sr. VP and deputy general counsel at an energy development company, I did
project development work, including turnkey project sales and power purchase
arrangements.  In private practice, I represented some end users, but mostly
utilities, in power purchases, transmission arrangements, project
development, joint ventures, and all of the other business relationships and
transactions that have been used as the industry has evolved from the
regulatory model to the market model.  I am assuming from Al's description
that you are looking for someone for Portland, Oregon, but Al said he wasn't
sure of the location.  Tell me what you are looking for, and I'll give you an
honest assessment of whether I think I would be a good prospect for filling
that need.

As we discussed when you gave me my offer letter, I have some vacation 
already planned and would like to make that vacation (with pay) a part of my 
offer of employment, in addition to the 28 or so hours that I'll accrue 
during the balance of 2000, which I will need to use for Thanksgiving and 
Christmas.  We are planning to spend the end of August in New England -- 
Thursday and Friday, Aug. 24 - 25, the following week of August 28 - 
September 1, and Labor Day, September 4.   Do you want to discuss this issue 
with Mark or would you prefer that I discuss it with him directly?

Otherwise, I am happy to accept the terms of the offer letter.  I still need 
to make some decisions about benefits.  I am assuming that I do not need to 
make my actual elections until my start date.  I would like to start on 
Monday, May 1 so that I have a couple of weeks to wrap things up with the 
firm.  

Thank you so much for all of your help with my transition to corporate life!

specifically what requires an exception?  I am the signoff for the wholesale

I am requesting that Rex Rogers, Vice President and Associate General 
Counsel, of our Enron Corp. Legal Department be granted an exception to the 
length of time that he can retain his messages.  He has some emails from 1999 
that are important for him to retain because they deal with Securities and

I have reviewed the O&M Expenses for ENA Legal for month-ended August 31, 
2000, as compared to the budgeted amount for the same period.  The overall 
legal budget was $4,835,184 over budget as of August 31, primarily due to 
Outside Costs which went over the planned amount by $5,094,838.  The most 
significant outside costs were incurred in litigation, power plant 
development, legally intensive deals such as United Illuminating, and 
misallocated costs for Projects Summer and California.  The Inside Costs were 
under budget in the amount of $259,654.

If you have any questions, please call me at extension 35448.

John and Michael would like to put together training for London-based traders 
on the "dos and don'ts" of using recorded telephone lines - As part of this 
we're listening to tapes to pick up on some "don'ts" (eg racist comments, 
harrassment, breach of SFA rules etc) which we can possibly use as case 
studies (you'll be pleased to hear that so far we haven't found anything of 
this nature!).

Have you given any training on this subject to traders in Houston?  Any 
materials you may have used or thoughts you have on this would be very much 
appreciated.  Thanks a lot.

Paul

Is it really necessary to coordinate everything through ENW?  I am not sure 
people will do that?  I think ENW should be informed but not be in control of 
the registration.  Have the ENW people requested that they be in charge of 
this process?  Will they care if we change it?

I wanted to follow up to see if you have had an opportunity to consider the

governing their use of third party electronic trading platforms, and there 
has been no centralized system for monitoring such use.  

Please give me a call with any questions or comments.

Mark Taylor and I have worked with Andy Zipper to develop a policy relating 
to use of third party electronic trading platforms.  We propose that you and 
Mark Frevert send the attached e-mail to all traders informing them of this 
policy.  Note that I included a contact for questions at the bottom of the 
policy.  I have listed myself for now.  We discussed sending this e-mail to 
all Enron traders, including those in Europe and within other business units.

Mark Taylor, Andy Zipper and Sheri Thomas (the designated master user who 
currently acts as Product Control Director for EnronOnline) have approved the 
e-mail and the policy.

I look forward to your comments on the policy.  After you have approved the 
e-mail and the policy, I will coordinate with Andy and Sheri to determine how 
best to circulate the e-mail.

Leslie

**************************************************************************
Many of you have received offers to use third -party electronic trading 
platforms like Dynegydirect.  Enron has a Policy Relating to Use of Third 
Party Electronic Trading Platforms to serve as a guide to appropriate 
registration for and use of such trading platforms.  The Policy provides that:

You must notify the Enron Net Works LLC (ENW) designee set out in the Policy 
if you would like to trade on such a trading platform.
All registration and other documentation must be sent to the ENW designee, 
who will coordinate the necessary legal and administrative review.
You are not authorized to use a third-party electronic trading platform until 
you are authorized by ENW.
The Master User for all third-party electronic trading platform accounts will 
be an ENW designee.
If you are currently using any third-party electronic trading platform, 
please notify the ENW designee.

A full copy of the Policy Statement is attached for your review.

Rosemary,

Should we limit the presentations to ISDA members only?  What about
FPML/Swift/Londex or e speed, or treasury connect, etc?  I believe we should 
try
to be inclusive of any important venture, member value from attendance goes up
as a result.

		 Subject: ENA Meeting and Event Expenditure Approval Process


The approval process initiated in 1998 for all meeting and event expenditures 
in excess of $5,000 has enabled ENA to better assess the business value of 
events, accurately track our activities and save money.  These events include 
customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.  

ENA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this 
memo.

The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the 
threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to 
$2,000, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.

Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and 
events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.

1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer 
events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events 
with anticipated costs in excess of $2,000 must be reviewed by the ENA Public 
Relations (PR) department and approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman

2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract 
negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department 
will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they 
can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department 
will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program 
and ENA.

3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting 
documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a 
detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please 
submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR 
department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the 
form.

4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the ENA Office of 
the Chairman for final approval.

Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for 
various local sporting events and concerts.

If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance 
planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie 
Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Wes, I am forwarding the monthly report on Legal.  It seems to be 
inconsistent with the legal budget numbers in the QBRs.  Overall, it shows 
Legal is slightly over budget for the year.  Could you have someone compare 
the numbers and let me know if the monthly report is correct.

Christian:

Based upon our discussion, here is the confirm I would like to attach to the 
internal DASH and send to McCook as the documentation we would require from 
BPA. This draft highlights changes from the Stoel Rives version which, based 
upon our discussion, are appropriate. I am available to discuss any of the 
nuances of the language. We are potentially looking at transacting tomorrow 
afternoon and Tracy Ngo is preparing the DASH which will go to Houston today 
(which requires input from you).

Thanks

E-mail / Voice Mail Retention Policy Change Notice

We have just received notice of a change to the e-mail and voice mail=20
retention policy.  The change will go into effect Friday, December 15, 2000=
.

The greatest impact will be to your "sent mail," which will be retained onl=
y=20
30 days as compared to the current 365 days. =20

As a reminder, you should not use the email system to store important=20
documents.
They should be saved to your network directory which is regularly backed up=
.

However, for 'sent' messages you want to keep longer than 30 days in the=20
email system, you should move the messages from the Sent Mail to a specific=
=20
folder where the messages can be kept 365 days.

The scope of the e-mail retention policy includes all forms of electronic=
=20
mail, for example, Lotus Notes Mail, Internet e-mail, Outlook e-mail, and=
=20
voice mail.

Enron supports a work environment in which information is freely exchanged=
=20
and encourages employees, contractors, and agents working on behalf of Enro=
n=20
to use its computers and related electronic resources in accomplishing thei=
r=20
work.  Computers, systems, and networks and the work products they contain=
=20
are Enron property and subject to Enron review and control.  All Enron=20
employees, contractors, and agents are responsible for using the computing=
=20
resources provided to them by Enron in an appropriate manner.

The revised retention schedule follows:

Message Location    Maximum Retention
Inbox     30 Days
Message Log/Sent Mail   30 Days
Trash     Rollover from Inbox for 15 days
Bulletin Boards    30 Days
Folders/Archives    E-mails placed in Folders or Archives =01) one year
Voice mail     90 days

The Corp IT Group responsible for maintaining compliance with this=20
e-mail/voice mail policy will automatically purge e-mail and voice mail old=
er=20
than the allowed maximum retention age.  Any exception to this policy=20
requires approval from Mark Haedicke or Richard Sanders.

If you need assistance in creating folders and saving documents to them,=20

                      Attorney-Client Privileged Communication


Since litigation has begun with Sempra, Somerset and Blue Grass, we should
see to it that documents relating to the issues in the lawsuit are
preserved.  For this purpose documents include not only hard copy but also
documents and information in electronic form and on voice or video
recordings.
It may well be that you will have questions on how to implement this
practice and more specifically what documents are covered. My suggestion is
that we start by trying to see that documents are not discarded and
determining what questions and issues there are.  Feel free to contact me
for guidance as you go forward.  It may well be that we should have a
conference call to see that everyone  is using the same procedures and to
address common issues.  If you think that would be desirable let me know.
We also need to see that other people who should get this notice have it
forwarded to them so that Enron's compliance is complete.

Mark -

I reviewed the information below and the current functionality of the=20
website.  Basically, eLaw is a shopping center for legal information. =20
Currently only information related to Labor & Employment is available, but=
=20
construction efforts are focused on many other areas including Antitrust,=
=20
Corporate Securities, E-Commerce, Environmental and Intellectual Property. =
=20

Since it is a shopping center, it basically works like any other shopping=

site.  You search for the information you want, whether it is an article,=
=20
legal brief or form document related to the desired topic.  Once you find=
=20
something you want, you move it to your "Briefcase" (or shopping cart) and=
=20
continue searching.  Once you have finished searching, you go to the check=
=20
out screen and, after checking out, down load the information, via e-mail, =
to=20
your computer.

As with the legal education site I have been looking at, the central questi=
on=20
is the integrity of the information.  Though it may have been developed by =
a=20
reputable source (e.g., Baker & Botts, Baker Hostetler, etc.), concerns as =

=20
there may be additional work to do in order to verify the information or=20
tailor it to the specific need (especially if the need has specific=20

I would be more than happy to further review the product if you wanted to=

Hopefully when we recruit for other areas, like LNG and the like, we will 
pick up a lawyer with some shipping experience.  It seems like overkill to 
recruit just for shipping.

Alan, Mark,

they are firing from all angles. We had this approach from Stu Staley and 
Pierre Aury. 

My line to them has basically been: we will provide best shipping advice 
promptly: please refer all your queries in this regard to Justin Boyd's team 
ie first contact: Robert Quick, Rahul Saxena, then any other team members, 
including Justin and failing them, me. 

So far, we are far from being swamped with technical shipping issues that we 
cannot deal with in-house. As and when we get to that position, we have good 
relationships with the best shipping firms in London, including Richards 
Butler and Sinclair Roche and Temperley. This may be adequate cover at that 
stage. Alternatively we may decide to recruit. In making that decision we 
would of course consult with George and Stu and the rest of the team. My view 
is that we are not at that stage yet. 

I would love this business to expand to the position where we needed to do 
that, and I hope we get there soon. When we do, we will ensure these business 
areas are properly covered until we get new staff on board. The business will 
not be prejudiced by a wait and see approach.

This approach has satisfied Stu and Pierre. Of course we have to be flexible; 
if George is adamant and prepared to fund the recruitment, then off we go. I 
think I could persuade him however that he didn't need to do that now. 

What are your views on this?

Subject to how you want to play things / have already played things with 
George, I would propose to speak to Stu and Pierre about this again and then 
call George to ensure he is happy with the game plan.

I'll try to call you both tomorrow morning your time to discuss this.

Thanks.



        Mark

we go forward is gaining ready access to competent shipping counsel.  I would

Mark;

Unfortunately, no soccer games on Monday and Tuesday.  However, if you are 
willing to anticipate your flight (Saturday night instead of Sunday night), 
Corinthians is playing its oldest and strongest competitor Palmeiras on 
Sunday at Morumbi Stadium at 4:00pm.  The most famous soccer games in Brazil 
are:  Flamengo vs. Fluminense in Rio ("Fla-Flu") and Corinthians vs. 
Palmeiras in S?o Paulo.  Please let me know if you want me to get VIP seats 
for you and others.

Rgds,

Sami

		 Subject: Legal strategy for summer in the west

Tim agrees that a half day legal strategy session about the pending summer 
melt down should happen sooner rather than later.   I understand that Richard 
and Elizabeth are scheduling a trip to Portland for the first week in April.  
I will coordinate their schedules with Tim's and tie down the details.  

Here is what I intend to do in the meantime.  Any thoughts or comments would 
be appreciated:

Get our major summer trading positions identified and get the contractual 
underpinings organized.  This is something that Kim Theriot's group can help 
us with.
Meet with our  fundamentals leader and our head scheduler to try to 
understand as much as we can about how  shortage scenarios might unfold and 
what power flow behavior at the key delivery points might look like.  
Meet with Steve Walters of Stoel Rives to get his mind focussed on big 
picture early positioning moves we might wish to take with BPA.
Get Marcus Wood to help us refine our understanding of BPA Surplus firm and 
Excess Federal Power and how BPA might reasonably be expected to act with 
respect to each.
Get credit to figure out if there is anyway we can get BPA to post a large 
amount of LC collateral to us.

I will be in Amsterdam for the ISDA board meeting on March 15 and 16.  I 
would like to get an update on the APX before leaving for Amsterdam.  For 
example, do we think it will be successful?  What kind of volume is trading?  
Also, I wanted to get your recommendation on what law firms or maybe the APX 
that I should visit while I am there.  Hope things are going well.

Hello Mark -- Andrei Postelnicu, Financial Times, will contact you regarding
the electronic trading article.  For reference, his number is 212-641-6339.

Mark, in cases where we receive similar requests in the future, may I put
reporters in contact with you directly? (with the understanding that,
depending upon the issue, you may or may not decide to speak with them) 

Also, feel free to let me know if you would like any of the ISDA staff to
join your call with Andrei. Many thanks -- Stacy

The FT has contacted ISDA regarding our contribution to an upcoming article
they are writing on the emergence of electronic trading.

ISDA staff will give them regulatory background in US and Europe.  I
thought
it might be worthwhile for them to hear a business/legal perspective as
well.

Would you be interested in speaking with the reporter within the next
couple
of days?  Please advise.  Many thanks!

		 Subject: Participation by Enron Canada in Private Placement of Impact Energy

Enron Canada plans to subscribe to a private placement of common shares in 
Impact Energy Inc. as a merchant equity investment, which private placement 
is closing tomorrow. The acquisition will be made pursuant to a standard long 
form subscription agreement.  Impact Energy is a publicly traded Canadian 
junior oil and gas company (trades on the TSE under the symbol TEY), which 
resulted from the reorganization of Startech Energy by and with ARC Energy in 
January 2001.  Kyle plans on subscribing for 545,455 common shares at a price 
per share of CDN$0.55, for total consideration of $300,000.25.  Under 
Canadian securities legislation, there will be a hold period imposed on the 
shares of one year from the date of issuance of the shares, meaning that 
Enron Canada will be prevented from reselling the shares in the open market 
for one year, unless it resells them pursuant to another exemption from the 
prospectus requirements available under such securities legislation.  Enron 
Canada previously obtained shares in Impact as part of the plan of 
arrangement involving Startech and ARC.

Should you require anything further, please either contact myself at 
403-974-6745 or Derek Lynn at 403-974-6719.

I have attached the "time allocations" (which are used for inside costs only) 
by attorney to the various business groups.  We can derive the percentage of 
total legal department inside costs from this chart, in order to calculate 
the capacity charge, for ENA and the other wholesale groups and ENW.  We had 
used this chart to bill back to the various business units within ENA, but we 
will stop doing that now per our conversation.  Are you in agreement?

Should the first order of business be to decide who is responsible for each 
form and then review who must approve the changes?  Maybe we should do that 
ahead of time?  Also, should we set a time schedule?  Mark

I would like to change our policy regarding taping telephone trades.  I 
propose the following:

1.   Retention Period  -- change the retention period from 4 months to 2 
months

2.  Record Only Deal Terms -- change from taping everything to taping only 
the deal terms at the end of a call

The first change could be made immediately and the second change would 
require both reprogramming (Phillippe is looking at this) and training of the 
traders to press the record button at the end of a call to record the deal 
terms.  Let me know your thoughts on the proposed changes.

Dear Mark,

Thank you for your e-mail. I have asked around our business people about
your inquiry.

At the moment, there are no institution that stands out in that field in
the Tokyo market. However, we, IBJ, are probably the most enthusiastic
about it. Historically, we have kept the strongest relationship with the
electricity companies and oil refineries. Their bond issues keep our
securities subsidiary on the top book runners list. Therefore, we are
researching on the product. Other Japanese firms seem to be less
interested.

Although I would think it should take a while to persuade those most
conservative companies like Tokyo Electricity et al., the product does
have a potential here.

In fact our derivatives and math men were really keen to talk to you and
learn more about the product.

Please let me know if I can be of any further help.

Terry

Effective October 15, 2000, the retention period on tape recordings of trades 
done by telephone will be reduced from four months to one month.  The tapes 
regarding significant transactions may be retained for such longer period as 
approved in writing by both the Head Trader and the General Counsel.  Please 
propose those significant transactions on which you may wish to retain the 
tapes, prior to October 15, 2000, since the tapes on conversations older than 
one month (except with respect to litigation matters) will be destroyed on 
that date.  If you have any questions, please contact Mark Haedicke or 
Richard Sanders.

		 Subject: Outside Counsel for transaction with Seminole Indian Tribe of 
Florida

Mark,

I have a unique outside counsel request on which I'd like your approval.  I 
am involved with a potential power plant development project with the 
Seminole Indian Tribe of Florida.  The project would be on their land and 
would potentially involve a joint venture with them.  Although we are at a 
preliminary stage, even the initial letter of intent that we are negotiating 
raises unique issues that will set the precedent for our project development 
agreements with respect to enforceability, jurisdiction and dispute 
resolution matters.  

I have identified and spoken with Lynn Slade of the New Mexico law firm of 
Modrall, Sperling, Roehl, Harris & Sisk on whether he could advise us on the 
Indian law issues associated with this project.  Lynn and several of his 
colleagues specialize on Indian law matters, and Lynn has experience both 
with representing Enron and in handling energy transactions in general.  In 
fact, Lynn gave a presentation at the 1999 Enron law conference entitled 
"Energy Business in 'Indian Country': Opportunities and Obstacles" (credit 
goes to Jeff Hodge for remembering that presentation and suggesting I contact 
Lynn); Lynn has represented several of Enron's pipeline companies, as well as 
the government affairs department, in connection with their Indian law issues 
and, at one time, prepared an opinion letter for ENA in a transaction 
involving the Ute tribe.  

Lastly, please note that I had asked our Florida counsel of Greenberg Trauig 
on whether they had any Indian law expertise, including specifically, any 
experience involving the Seminoles.  Unfortunately, the Seminoles are one of 
their clients so Greenberg cannot represent us in a manner adverse to the 
Tribe.  

Thanks in advance for your attention and consideration of this request.

Mark, I have not talked to you about whether you want me to sign-off on 
DASHes before they go Buy/Glisan/Skilling. I was doing so for EECC and NEPCO 
for Vicki, but you might want to revisit that.

The attached are for two of our work-out projects in the Gulf of Mexico.  
Please have a look and let me know if you want to sign DASHEs for thsi unit  
or if you prefer that I continue to sign them.

John, it looks fine to me.  The only comment that could be updated is the 
last sentence of the Other RAC Comments could be replaced with  "Horizon has 
indicated they have found another source of financing and Enron is currently 
providing information to facilitate a take-out offer from Horizon next month."

Jim:  Here is the background of the "dispute" with Blakes.  There is a lot of 
emotion on both sides.  I believe we need Blakes on a going forward basis in 
Canada.

		 Subject: Blakes

Mark, I understand that you and Jim D. are meeting in Houston next week 
regarding Blakes, their mismanagement of the NGX litigation, and other 
matters.  I am providing you the following report, so as the facts and issues 
are clear.  I am taking the time to send you this report because I am 
concerned that Dan Fournier has demonstrated to date that he either does not 
understand the facts and issues (which is amazing) or believes he can 
obfuscate and resolve the issues through political maneuvering.

You will recall that this matter kicked off late in Sept./00 with NGX giving 
us two days' notice that they were taking over control of the methodology for 
determining the prevalent gas indices effective Oct. 1/00.  You will also 
recall that the matter was of significant concern to John Lavorato and Greg 
Whaley, among others, and following a conference call with John, Greg, Steve 
Kean, Rick Shapiro and others, it was agreed that we would consider our legal 
remedies, including that I would prepare a draft stern letter to NGX advising 
them of our concerns and the potential for litigation with Enron, both for 
internal review and review by outside counsel.  I discussed the facts and the 
letter with Blakes (Dalton McGrath) who advised me that he would also be 
discussing the matter with a competition law partner in Toronto.  In the end 
Blakes had some minor comments on the letter and provided a cover letter 
confirming that in the circumstances we had a difficult put provable case.

One issue raised by the letter was the potential involvement of NGX's 
shareholders, for a number of reasons, including:  (i) NGX had only two 
shareholders, Westcoast Energy and OM Gruppen, who to our knowledge 
controlled the mind and management of NGX;  (ii) OM Gruppen is in the 
business around the world of purchasing or creating electronic exchanges and 
had recently purchased its position in NGX from Westcoast;  Westcoast is the 
sole shareholder of Engage Energy, a energy trading competitor;  (iii) NGX's 
transaction for acquiring control of the indices was an aggressive, 
structured attack designed to cause harm to EOL and regain market share that 
EOL had taken away; and, (iv) NGX is a limited liability entity with little 
in hard assets and therefore may have been judgment proof.  Obviously, if the 
evidence or commercial/strategic reasons warranted not proceeding against the 
shareholders at any time, it was our intention not to continue to proceed 
against them.

In short, Blakes was aware from the outset of our intention to involve 
Westcoast in any litigation.

As expected, we did not receive a satisfactory response to our letter to NGX, 
and between late Sept./00 and Nov. 29/00, the date we filed the lawsuit and 
applied for injunctive relief, I had countless further discussions with 
Blakes to draft, and redraft, and redraft again, a Statement of Claim and 
Motion documents, all of which clearly involved Westcoast as a named 
defendant.

Although the Court would not grant an injunction "ex parte", an aggressive 
timeline was established for filing affidavits and briefs, completing 
cross-examinations, etc. with the injunction application set for Dec. 20/00, 
to our strategic advantage.

We were proceeding vigorously on this basis when to my surprise I received a 
phone call from Dan Fournier on Dec. 4/01 (9 weeks into the matter) to advise 
me that there was a "legal" conflict problem involving Westcoast, who is 
occasionally represented out of Blakes' Toronto office by Glenn Leslie.

I explained to Dan that if there was a conflicts problem between Enron and 
Westcoast, and although I was willing to do what I could in the 
circumstances, I was extremely concerned as to what could be done at that 
stage prior to the injunction hearing, noting the conflicts problem was of 
Blakes own making.  Indeed it seemed it was the problem of a Toronto-based 
partner who did not pay enough attention at the outset to look after his 
firm's and his own client's interests, which then needed to be resolved on an 
after-the-fact basis.

Although the problem was initially misleadingly presented to me by Dan as a 
legal conflict on the basis of Blakes having "certain confidential 
information regarding Westcoast", which I suspected to be a justification 
rather than the truth, when probed, Dan admitted that the conflict was a 
business conflict rather than a legal conflict.

Nonetheless, it was suggested by Dan that Blakes could proceed if Enron 
discontinued the action against Westcoast, which obviously was not advice 
given in Enron's interest.

I responded that this was not only unacceptable from a strategic if not legal 
position, and it was emphasized by me to Dan as being unnecessary and 
meaningless for the purposes of the injunction application, as the injunction 
was being sought against NGX and Canadian Enerdata, and no immediate remedy 
was being sought against Westcoast.

Nonetheless, and as a favor to Blakes, I agreed that if Blakes acted on the 
injunction only (which, as noted, did not involve Westcoast) scheduled for 
Dec. 20th, I would transition the file to another firm immediately after the 
injunction, in an orderly manner that did not adversely affect Enron's 
interests.

This result was not apparently acceptable to Blakes.  Late that evening I was 
advised by Dan that a call was being had at Blakes first thing the next 
morning involving Blakes' Chairman, Blakes' Managing Partner, the Westcoast 
responsible partner (Glenn Leslie) and the Enron responsible partner (Dan 
Fournier) to discuss the issue, and if it could not be resolved 
satisfactorily, Dalton McGrath, who is a more junior partner, would likely be 
held accountable.

Unsatisfied that my relationship with Dalton McGrath was being put into 
issue, and after reviewing the matter that evening at the time and 
inconvenience of Milnthorp at home, I called Dan first thing (7:00 am) the 
next morning to nonetheless reiterate to him that I would not only undertake 
to relocate the file, but I would try to do my best to move the file if 
possible ASAP, even BEFORE the injunction application, provided I could be 
satisfied that it could done in a way that was not adverse to Enron's 
interests.

Again, my unusual and more than reasonable accommodations to solve a problem 
of Blakes own making were not apparently satisfactory, as after the Blakes 
internal management call, I was advised late that next morning by Dan that:

(a)  Blakes had decided that, regardless of our wishes, the file must be 
transferred to another firm ASAP, such that, although Blakes would assist in 
the transition and the pending cross examination of Jon MacKay and Seabron 
Adamson, Blakes would have no involvement in the briefs to be filed nor in 
appearing at the injunction application, and would cease immediately to 
appear as solicitors of record, notwithstanding that the injunction was then 
for only a few business days hence under a greatly abbreviated court ordered 
timeline for examinations, briefs, etc.;  finding and educating replacement 
counsel would have to be done at year end, with extraordinary demands on 
replacement counsel (not to mention Enron's other year end commercial 
business concerns, requiring better use and allocation of our resources).

(b)  In making its decision, Blakes had considered:

 - the relative complexity of the Enron vs. Westcoast work (I would have 
assumed Enron would have won this one.)

 - relative annual billings (I would have assume, and it was later confirmed 
to me, that Enron's annual billings were more than 2-3x Westcoast's for the 
past 3 years.)

 - relative strategic importance to Blakes (Enron is the only international, 
Fortune 500 firm represented by Blakes out of its Calgary office.  I also 
would have assumed that Blakes Toronto has an interest in the deregulating 
Ontario power markets, in which Enron expects to be a market leader.  I also 
would have assumed that Blakes would have appreciated the increased profile 
that Enron has given it in the pulp and paper industry, the gas industry, the 
power industry, the insolvency industry, the derivatives and commodity 
trading markets, and in other jurisdictions such as in the Province of 
Quebec, in the Province of British Columbia, in Houston and with other 
counsel which historically act for Enron.)

 - its policy not to sue established clients (Although admirable and a policy 
with which I agree, I assume it was weighed against what must also be a long 
standing and overriding policy of not dumping established clients, especially 
having regard to ethical obligations; the immediacy of the matter; the time 
of year; the business rather than legal conflict; Enron's more than 
reasonable offers to move the file ASAP under its own control but even prior 
to the injunction application; the various misdirections and excuses; the 
fact that Blakes, and particularly the Westcoast responsible partner, knew or 
ought to have known of the conflict for approx. 9 weeks; and, most 
importantly, that Blakes problem was one of its own internal making.  Simply 
put, Blakes did not have the luxury of strictly relying on such a lofty 
principle in the circumstances.)

(c)  The arrangement had been pre-approved by Westcoast.  In other words, not 
only did Enron not have a say in the matter, its litigation adversary had all 
the say.

In short, it is difficult to conceive how on any reasonable basis Blakes came 
to its decision, or decided to communicate its decision in the way it did.  
The situation was of Blakes making, Enron had given Blakes a reasonable way 
out, and, with minimal fortitude by Blakes, and commercial reasonableness and 
respect of Westcoast towards Blakes, the decision to act for Enron on the 
terms proposed by me was obvious.

* * * * * * * * *

Mark, I have no clue why Blakes came to the decision it did in the 
circumstances.  Perhaps Blakes Toronto partner serviced clients are 
preferred?  Perhaps Blakes Calgary partners do not, or do not have the 
ability to represent the legitimate concerns of Enron within Blakes Toronto? 
Perhaps the Enron relationship is not adequately valued or Blakes does not 
like Enron's style?  Perhaps Blakes misjudged Enron's reaction relative to 
what would have been Westcoast's reaction in the alternative?  Whatever, the 
decision and the approach was wholly unsatisfactory.  Blakes needs to be 
accountable, and after-the-fact explanations, justifications, confessions, 
etc. are easily given, do not measure up to prior actions, and are 
necessarily self-serving. 

It is also noteworthy that Blakes decision partly resulted in an adjournment 
of the injunction application to Feb. 18/01 and fundamentally destroyed our 
opportunity to win the injunction which has since been dropped at 
considerable out-of-pocket cost and business prejudice to Enron.  It is also 
noteworthy that Westcoast soon after sold out its position in NGX to OM 
Gruppen, and that we have dropped both NGX and OM Gruppen from the lawsuit.

Mark, I have told Blakes that in these circumstances, more than explanations, 
excuses and promises are necessary.  I also told them that we are focused on 
developing more external counsel relations, and since I have retained Oslers, 
Stikemans, and Ernst & Young on various matters with good results.  I told 
Blakes that we certainly would not preclude using them, but that before I did 
so I wanted an explanation as to how these circumstances arose and how Blakes 
took the decision it did and communicated it the way it did.  

I also told Blakes that the quality and staffing of their work had been 
slipping for some time, and that I would want a renewed commitment to 
staffing files with quality lawyers who are responsible for the working 
relationships.

If you want to discuss the matter in advance of your meeting, please let me 
know.

Peter.

Mark:? We had talked about my coming on board with Enron some six years ago 
prior to my moving up to New York State Electric & Gas Corporation as their 
Chief Counsel.

Right now I am with Engage Energy as their Senior Counsel, representing the 
company's power business.? 

As you may know, we are going through a merger here (Coastal/El Paso).? As a 
part of the merger-related activity, Engage (which is a limited partnership) 
is being split as between its two owners, Westcoast and Coastal. 

Virtually all of my clients (the "big deal" Structured Power Group here at 
Engage) are moving with a subsidiary of our other owner, Westcoast, while I 
am remaiining here in Houston with Engage, which is a Coastal subsidiary.? 
So, despite the fact that power is a growth area, my propsects vis a vis the 
merger are less good than if I were still supporting a substantial client 
base.? So, I am now looking at other opportunities that may be available, 
despite the fact I have been with Engage only a year.

Attached you will find a cover letter and my resume.? I hope you find my 
credentials and background of interest and I hope to hear from you soon.

I will forward a hard copy of the attached documents to you as well.? Thank 
you.

Today I gave a presentation to the originators and traders in Gary 
Hickerson's ag group, including a proposal of control procedures for 
compliance with ag option restrictions.  Gary was not present, but the 
procedures were well received by the group, who felt that they were practical 
and could be complied with.

Attached is an outline of the presentation, including the proposed 
procedures.  -- Bob

Today, I talked to the GC of both Southern and Duke.  Each GC said they were 
not really up to speed on the issues.  I took the opportunity to walk them 
through the Nerc letter and the action taken at the Serc board meeting.  They 
each attempted to argue our fight was really with TVA.

if we have 25% overriding interest - then perhaps we are going to get 25% of 
the upside from this whole thing.  Can you check out all upsides too please.

You can tell its Friday - I'm optimistic about everything!

Attached per your request and for your review is a draft memo to EWS Legal 
regarding limiting use of Unanimous Consents of Directors.

I am researching the question regarding the use of stamps for signatures and 
will follow up with you shortly.

Jim:

Per our conversations, I propose the following additions to your draft memo:

Global Trading --  All lawyers providing legal services for trading 
activities (anywhere in the world) will continue to be consolidated into one 
group reporting to Mark Haedicke.

Legal Risk Books -- Mark will undertake an Enron-wide long term project to 
categorize legal risks into standardized risk "books".  To that end, Mark 
will form a team to work closely with each General Counsel or her/his 
designee regarding the significant legal risks in each subsidiary company. 
The goal will be to help us better understand our legal risks on a 
consolidated basis and to provide additional tools to manage our legal risks 
day to day.  It is anticipated that a consolidated monthly legal risk report 
will be prepared for Enron.

you change about the Senate bill?

I think it is both Rappaport and his target audience.  I think Dan needs to 
hear directly from us that we are not happy with the position he has taken re 
electronic trading.  Silence by us could be misinterpreted by him.  Let me 
know what you think.

Do you really this the right avenue would be directly to Rappaport - isn't it 
his target audience?

Do we need to do this - do you think the other exchanges will do something?

Mark - yesterday, I gave an update/projection presentation to Delainey, 
Donahue and Bowen and as you know part of it included the status of the 
various HR related issues (harassment, dismissals, etc...).  Hopefully, 
you're aware that Michelle Cash, Dan Lyons and Butch Hayes (Fulbright & 
Jaworski) have been guiding me all along and are fully up to speed.  However, 
Delainey wants me to get with you to make sure you're 100% in the loop as 
well.  

Let me (or Beth) know what's convenient for you and I'll flex my calendar as 
much as possible.

Thanks, RANDY

All:

Be careful of paying for insurance wraps.  Lots of noise in the system about 
insurance companies not paying.  I met with Chase last week and their credit 
guys expressed extreme skepticism over the efficacy of insurance wraps.

Tim: Talk to the market to ensure that our A1/P1 facility is still viewed as 
an A1/P1 risk.

Joe & Jordan: Scrub down the credit reserve policy, we need to make certain 
that we are in absolute compliance with the documents.  If not we need to 
clean up the documentation ASAP (it seems highly unlikely that we would not 
be making significant claims under that policy this year).

AIG Declines to Pay Flashpoint Bonds, Triggers 18-Not


Following is the article menioned in yesterday's meeting.  

AIG Declines to Pay Flashpoint Bonds, Triggers 18-Notch S&P Cut
2/8/1 13:3 (New York)

AIG Declines to Pay Flashpoint Bonds, Triggers 18-Notch S&P Cut

     London, Feb. 8 (Bloomberg) -- A pair of ``AAA''-rated bonds
issued by Flashpoint Ltd. suffered an 18-notch downgrade by
Standard & Poor's after a unit of American International Group
Inc. said it won't pay on insurance that guarantees the bonds.
     The $149.1 million of bonds, named Hollywood Funding No. 5.
and No. 6, were sold by the U.K. company to finance films and
television shows. S&P assigned its top rating to the securities
because they're guaranteed by Lexington Insurance Co., a
subsidiary of AIG, the world's largest insurer.
     Investors who bought the zero-coupon bonds were to be repaid
by the revenue from a basket of films. When the films didn't make
enough to cover those payments, the insurance policy was designed
to kick in. Lexington, though, said it won't cover the shortfall
because the film company broke its contract. Now, S&P regards the
bonds as ``vulnerable to nonpayment,'' and rates them ``CCC-.''
     ``There has never been a downgrade of that magnitude in
Europe,'' said Kurt Sampson, head of structured finance ratings
at S&P. ``We are voicing our concern about the implications for
the capital markets. The degree of our concern is evident by the
fact we are going public with this.''
     S&P, which downgraded the Hollywood bonds on Friday, said
Lexington's actions have prompted it to review other securities
insured by Lexington in case the insurer seeks to ``raise
defenses to the payment'' due on other bonds.
     Joe Norton, AIG's spokesman, said the company won't comment
on the bonds. Graham Johnson at Flagship Group, which handles
press communications for Flashpoint, said the company regards the
bonds as ``not a matter that it's appropriate for them to comment
on.'' Credit Suisse First Boston, which managed the private sale
of Flashpoint's six Hollywood Funding bonds, also declined to
comment.

                         Cash Shortfall

     Hollywood Funding No. 5, a $48.4 million dollar bond, was
due to be repaid on Jan. 5, according to people familiar with the
security. Bondholders haven't been paid, and agreed to wait for
two months before triggering a default because Lexington is
investigating whether the issuer broke its contract with the
insurer, S&P said.
     ``The policies were to provide for sufficient funds to pay
the notes in full, should revenues in the trustee's other
accounts be insufficient,'' S&P said. ``S&P believed that the
original policies'' would pay out under any circumstances, ``and
that any such matters were not supposed to constitute a defense
to payment on the policies.''
     S&P's defines ``AAA'' ratings as those applying to issuers
with an ``extremely strong'' ability to meet their obligations.
     The rating company also said that Lexington won't be meeting
shortfalls on Hollywood Funding No. 6, a $100.7 million bond
maturing on June 18, because the issuer broke its contract by not
making as many films at it agreed to.

Stu,
I am sure you will be aware from your market intelligence of the problems at 
FF
Unit 2, which we are advised is an event of Force Majeur. I believe it would 
be
counter-productive to the spirit of current negotiations to prosecute an FM
claim and do not therefore propose to do so at this time. However, in the 
event
of an unsatisfactory outcome to these negotiations we do reserve the right to
ultimately pursue a Force Majeur claim in respect of the failure of FF Unit 2.
I am also holding back FF's claim for mill damage from the rogue cargo of hard
La Loma coal on the same principle.
Please respond if you disagree with this approach.
Regards
Max

Mark:

Could you check to see if you guys know anything about Avista Energy, Inc in
Spokane, Wash. and Kangqi Oil Trading in Singapore?

Both have applied for Subscriber membership.  I'm thinking that Avista
should maybe be a Primary?

Thanks
Mary

George, I think your proposal is a good one in light of all the facts at 
hand.  I think it is best if we take the high road in approach as you have 
proposed.  I would ask Robert to prepare a one page bullet list of your 
points and then let's all briefly review it.  I want to stay mindful that 
litigation is possible and we have to chose our words carefully in event of 
litigation.  

Mark

		 Subject: Restructuring Meeting

Memo to Credit Derivatives Documentation Task Force:
We have arranged for meetings of the Credit Derivatives Documentation Task
Force to take place simultaneously in New York and London on Monday,
November 13, at 9:30 NY time/2:30 London time. The New York meeting will
take place at the offices of Chase Manhattan Bank, 270 Park Avenue, 11th
Floor, Room C. The London meeting will take place at the offices of Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, 20 Cabot Square, Canary Wharf, London E14.  Please RSVP
to Barbara Hanlon at bhanlon@isda.org indicating at which location you will
be attending.
At each meeting, I will arrange for several individuals to present their
view on the Restructuring issue. There will then be an opportunity in each
meeting to ask questions of those individuals and for more general
discussion. We will then link the London and New York meetings by telephone
to share views between the meetings. 
This distribution list is drawn from participants in the documentation
process. The Restructuring issue, while focused on a term in the
documentation, is nevertheless one of market practice and not really one of
documentation. We, therefore, encourage you to ensure that the views of your
trading desk are expressed at the meeting, preferably by having someone from
the desk at the meeting. We expect a large number of people at the meetings,
however, so we also encourage you to consider who from your institution is
most critical to be in attendance to ensure that your views are heard. 
We look forward to hearing from you on the 13th.

Dear all,

As we know, some of the persons on the distribution list of Polish weekly 
updates still receive the updates, although they have changed their positions 
and/or responsibilties. As we would not like to bother you with our e-mails 
with the reports that you do not need, please confirm that you wish to 
continue receiving the reports on Enron's activities in Poland. 

The common address ECT London European Trading will be deleted from the list 
as a whole. Only the persons who send the confirmation will be added to the 
list.

Thank you.


With best regards,

Jarek Ferenc

		 Subject: Technology Team Meeting

To All -

Thanks again for the participation in this project.  I believe we made some 
progress yesterday on the overall look and feel of the site. 

Meeting Notes:

Mark - Presented ideas for the look and feel of the web site based on law 
firm web sites and intra-Enron sites.  I will continue to pursue work with 
the IT group on the design and implementation of the site.

Michelle - Reported on her progress with the ENA PR group on a name.  
click.legal or click.law seem to be the favorite addresses; however, 
"legalmatters.enron" was also suggested.  Michelle will continue to work with 
the ENA PR group to develop a name, possible logo and slogan/tag-line 
consistent with the Enron vision statement.

Janette - Reported on the status of the organization chart information to be 
used on the site.  Indicated she is still waiting for responses from several 
of the groups for the "who are we" paragraph.  She is also making progress on 
matching the org. chart to the individual legal team members.  Work on this 
project will continue.

Ed/James - Both reported on the status of link identification.  Discussion 
took place regarding the further identification of categories associated with 
the links and those links that will be useful to the Department, realizing 
that few clients will actual access our site for links.  Work on a listing of 
categories and sites for these categories will continue.


General Information:

Subsequent to our meeting, I met with our designated IT project coordinator - 
Tamika Hebert.  We spent almost two hours discussing the functionality we 
want in the site.  Unfortunately, John Reese, our IT designer, was out of the 
office and unable to provide me with the design ideas he has to date.  I hope 
to receive these designs later today or tomorrow and will make them available 
to everyone for comment.  I also provided Tamika with references to some of 
the sites we reviewed during our meeting so that she could understand some of 
the look, feel and functionality we want.

Concerning actual development of the background structure, the "programmer" 
has not been identified for this project, but should be by the end of this 
week.  Once he/she is identified, work will begin on the design of the 
functionality of the site.  Concurrent with this effort, it is necessary that 
we start providing content to Tamika so that site areas can be tested and 
reviewed.  Accordingly, once information is available in your respective 
areas, please provide it to me or forward it directly to Tamika.

Reminder - Please remember to note that we have moved the time of the meeting 
from 2:00 to 2:30.  Our next meeting will be next Wednesday, November 1 in 
EB38C2.

Thanks again for the hard work.

		 Subject: Retail Initiative

Mark I am following up with you regarding legal support for this matter.

Mark P. is dedicated to this project and getting up the learning curve by 
focusing his time on understanding the regulatory/statutory/licensing 
requirements for a retail affiliate for Alberta electricity.  We hope to have 
a recommendation shortly on an action plan for the regulatory compliance 
requirements, a recommendation on contracting forms (separate commercial and 
residential consumer forms) and to begin drafting forms.

However, as discussed, outside counsel legal support will be required (i) to 
set up/register the retail entity to do business (subject to confirmation of 
the outstanding structuring issue, on which I await an answer); (ii) confirm 
all regulatory/statutory/licensing requirements for a retail affiliate; (iii) 
review and advise on contracting forms; and (iv) take an advocacy position 
for us at upcoming regulatory hearings.  In this regard we had agreed to talk 
to Stikeman Elliott about representation.  It turns out the Stikemans has an 
unresolveable conflict, as it acts for Enmax, the City of Calgary's retail 
affiliate and a direct competitor.  From asking around, it also seems that 
any of the firms which have/may have experience in the developing retail 
market, have acquired that experience for a client that would put them in 
direct conflict as well (ex. Bennet Jones - Atco/Canadian Utilities;  Macleod 
Dixon and McCarthy Tetrault - TransAlta;  Burnet Duckworth - City of 
Calgary/Enmax/City of Medicine Hat;  Borden Ladner Gervais - EPCOR), many of 
whom we have no experience in dealing with in any event.  It seems to me that 
the available alternatives are Blake Cassels & Graydon and Osler Hoskin & 
Harcourt, neither of whom to my specific knowledge have specific expertise in 
this area.  However, as noted, those with any actual (or purported) expertise 
tend for that reason to be conflicted.  Accordingly, my suggestion is that I 
speak to Blakes to see what expertise they have, but likely nonetheless 
retain them (assuming there is no conflict) on the basis of their general 
capabilities and their understanding and commitment to Enron.  At the end of 
the day, even if there is a learning curve, it is seemingly learnable and 
inevitable.  Please let me know if you have a problem, as we need to move 
quickly to get on with the project.

To confirm, you were going to let me know how we should proceed with 
structuring the affiliate (liability vs. tax efficiency), which may be 
affected by how and if EES participates.

Once the ball is rolling on the Alberta electricity front, we will re-focus 
on gas and other jurisdictions, such as Ontario.

Regards, Peter.

Subject: The power of why

Mr. Walls

I was checking the stock prices when I saw the Enron=01%s homepage saying "=
The
power of Why". So, I=01%ve decided to write these few words. Certainly you =
do
not remember me as you meet lots of people everyday around the world. But I
had the pleasure of meeting you when I was attending a SAP training course
in 2000 when I was in Houston.
I worked for the Legal Departament in the Sao Paulo office and had been
developing a good job (at least my performance evaluations said so) when I
was said teh company was firing many people and I was included in the fatal
list. My immediate supervisors tried to do everything they could to keep me
there and all the answers were no.
I want you to know that this message is not to complain about my firing.
Everyone who works is subject to this fact, specially in Brazil. I simply
became astonished when I was told that two people are being hired for the
same position I had less than 2 months after I left the company.
So, my question is WHY? Why and how does Enron commit such a mistake? I
really trusted the company I used to work for, I really enjoyed working for
Enron and why? Why did Enron fired me and two months later started hiring
two others for the same position? How can such a big company like Enron be
so unreasonalble and why not to say insensitive?

Sorry for this emotional words but I had to say that. I know you might not
even  read this message but I had to try, specially because I did believe i=
n
RICE and I felt I had found out a company where the speech did correpond to
the action, but unfortunately...

Thank you for giving me a little piece of your time and wish success for th=
e
company because I still have friends working very hard there and they reall=
y
like it as I did once.

Thanks a lot for your attention.

Mark, 

Per my telephone conversation with Margaret Gerhardt, I want to thank you 
very much for your interest in participating on the e-commerce panel for the 
Energy Bar Association mid-year program.? Margaret suggested that you be 
listed on the program brochure as "invited," in case a conflict should arise. 
The Association will be distributing a final brochure at a later date which 
will reflect any changes in speakers.? Attached for your information is a 
draft program brochure and a brief overview of the? e-commerce panel.? The 
Association believes that the e-commerce panel is timely given the dramatic 
impact that electronic commerce is having on the economy generally, and in 
particular due to the unprecedented changes taking place in the energy 
industries.? Having the perspective of EnronOnline, the industry leader, will 
be a great addition to the program. 

Please let me know if you have questions or need additional information.? I 
look forward to seeing you at the program.

Rick:

As you know, Clinton should sign, over the next couple of days, legislation 
on electronic signatures.  There is a big need to standardize the approach 
with respect to e-signatures on trading contracts and maybe confirmations.  I 
think this is an area that ISDA could provide leadership and possibly make 
money through a protocol.  Let me know what you think.

Chris:

Thanks for the update.  Let's try to get together in Toronto on Tuesday, 
August 15 or 22.  Do either of those days work for you?  I would envision 
getting up to speed on business opportunities in Ontario and addressing the 
questions you raised.  Your proposal makes sense, but I would like to defer 
our decision until we have had a chance to talk it through.

Subject: The Anti-trust Seminars

I sent you along yesterday a copy of the e-mail re the participation by Rob 
and me in the seminars that Blakes is doing for the traders and originators 
in Canada.  Thinking about it more this morning, I am wondering whether the 
seminars that Sullivan & Cromwell are doing in the US are too narrow in 
their  focus.  That is, it is important for traders not merely to understand 
the competition/anti-trust rules but also  the rules and practices of the 
market surveillance panels or committees that operate, I think, in each of 
the ISO jurisdictions.   It is that piece that Rob and I will be  trying to 
add in Canada.  Just a thought in case you want to raise it withJeff Hodge or 
Mark Haedicke.

Thursday and Friday of next week off (December 14 and 15).  That will bring

[Distribution]

Prior to the equity investment in and joint venture with Power Systems 
Manufacturing ("PSM"), we will need to take the following actions:


+ Conduct additional due diligence on the PSM/General Electric ("GE") lawsuit 
regarding infringement of GE patents.  We will need to determine if the 
litigation will affect the viability of PSM as the operator or ENA as owner 
of the equipment involved in the litigation.  This will commence immediately 
and a brief legal opinion obtained on these points.

+Conduct legal patent due diligence on the mobile power units that are the 
subject of the proposed joint venture and obtain legal opinions with respect 
to both the component parts being acquired and the proposed modified  units 
themselves.  [Timing]

The volume and complexity of our legal work has increased dramatically over 
the past few years.  I think this environment requires additional time to be 
devoted to legal planning and review in order to provide the best possible 
service to our clients.  Within the next month, I have asked Janette to 
schedule a Quarterly Legal Review for each group listed on our new 
organizational chart .  I  would envision that we would focus on the 
following:  

review of the current monthly legal report and significant legal issues
review of the top ten legal risks
form contracts and other documentation projects
legal budget
legal resources, inside and outside
performance metrics

In addition, I am proposing that any energy trading contract for a term 
longer than one year by initialled by an AGC or member of the OGC.  Let me 
know what you think about that.

Gentlemen -

We are currently in the processing of serving/delivering the GOM Guarantee 
demand and the PPA Meet and Discuss Letter.  Ken Lay approved the delivery in 
a conference call this morning.  Our attention will then turn to the GOI 
Guarantee demand (can be served a week from today), the Notice of Arbitration 
under the GOM Guarantee and anticipation of injunctive relief being sought by 
our counterparties to stay any arbitration and collection/payment on the 
guarantees.

We are scheduled to meet with the lenders in NY tomorrow.

Subject: Dabhol - An Update on Legal Efforts

Jim/Mark -

I know that Rob has been keeping you generally apprised, but I thought that I 
would update you both on the quickly evolving Dabhol situation.

The commercial situation at Dahbol Power Company is deteriorating pretty 
rapidly.  MSEB is now approx. 45 days late on payment in full of the October 
invoice.  They have paid only a relatively modest portion of that bill.  
Payment on the November bill is about 15 days late.  The MSEB Chairman says 
that MSEB can't pay these invoices.

At present, the Governments of Maharashtra and India are refusing to engage 
in a constructive dialogue on solving the non-payment issue and the 1400 MW 
that will come on line as part of Phase II.  They say that they recognize 
their obligations as guarantors of MSEB's obligations but are not interested 
in helping in any different capacity (e.g., GOI buys some or all of Phase II).

Until just a few days ago, the lead India bank was refusing to fund even 
their own ongoing interest obligation.  At present, they are refusing to 
continue funding any other Phase II draw request.  The India banks have a 
great deal to lose and, in our opinion, should strongly consider continuing 
to fund Phase II.  It would seem that the lead India bank is scared, knaive 
or, worse yet, very pessimistic about Dabhol's future -- perhaps there are 
other reasons for their current position.

We are meeting with the international banks in NY on Tuesday.  Our main goal 
is to convince them to continue to fund and to use their influence to have 
the India banks do the same.

The current India legal crisis team is nearly identical to the 1995 India 
legal crisis team.  The same law firms and lawyers (both Indian and 
international) are continuing to play much the same roles.

We have not identified any particular "holes" in Dabhol's legal position.  
While the India newspapers have offered up various theories that might allow 
MSEB to cancel the PPA (frustration of purpose, etc.), none seem compelling.  
No counterparty has offered up any of these theories directly to DPC.

In the short term, we are preparing (1) a demand under the GOM guarantee and 
(2) a "meet and discuss" letter under the PPA.  The current plan is to serve 
these next week.  We are also preparing (3) an arbitration notice under the 
GOM guarantee, (4) a demand under the GOI guarantee and (5) an action against 
MERC.  MERC is the Maharashtra Energy Regulatory Commission.  They have 
issued "orders" over the last year limiting the amount of power that MESB 
buys from Dabhol.  We do not believe that they have jurisdiction to do so.  
We may or may not ultimately file this action.

Let me know if I can provide any further information.

Bruce

I am very interested in Steve and think we could use him in addition to 
Shari.  The only problem is that I agreed that I would not try to recruit him 
so the firm would agree to let us second him.  We just need to proceed slowly 
with him and hopefully it will work out to our benefit.

By the way, I spoke to Chris Foster and Greg Wolfe about the relative merits 
of Steve Hall and Shari Stack.  Their thinking was that Steve is probably a 
better "deep thinker" (to use Elizabeth's words) but that he might be bored 
with the routine transaction work that Shari seems to really enjoy.  He also 
doesn't have the ISDA background which would provide tremendous benefit to 
us.  Therefore, I think Shari is a better fit for our current needs.  

Having said that, I am extremely impressed with Steve.  He has a better 
handle on this California work than anyone I've worked with yet.  He seems 
really bright and responsive.  I talked to him last week about working for 
Enron and he seemed interested.  I didn't get into any details about our 
needs, but gauged his general level of interest in the work that he is doing 
for us and his willingness to consider jobs other than his current one.  He 
basically said that he would be happy to hear about opportunities here.  I 
was talking to Richard Sanders yesterday and he also is impressed with Steve 
and said that he had considered trying to hire him.  I don't know if there is 
a position for Steve or not.  I just wanted to give you feedback on my 
discussions with him.  Let me know if you need any help or information from 
me on this matter.

Regards,
Tim

I would like to do fewer resolutions authorizing non-vps to sign contracts, 
and when we need such authorizations, let's make sure the resolutions are 
appropriately limited.  My thoughts are as follows:

1.   We have a lot of vps that can sign contracts.
2.   It is generally ok to have confirmations signed by certain carefully 
selected directors since we are confirming a trade that already took place 
and there is master agreement already signed.
3.   There are certain very routine agreements like pipeline right-of-way 
agreements that are ok for carefully selected directors to sign.
4.   Confidentiality agreements should be signed by a vp.
5.   Any authorization for a director to sign should expire within not more 
than one year and revoke all prior authorizations.

Please give me your comments.

Mark

Greetings.  I have been reading about lliberalization of power markets in 
Japan starting next year.  I wondered if you expect IBJ or any of the other 
large financial institutions in Japan to make a market in power?  Would you 
or someone else you know want to talk about that?  Let me know.  Hope things 
are going well.

Take care.

I thought last week was very productive.  I appreciated your help.  The ISDA 
office in Tokyo is set to open officially on April 13, 2000.   Yasuko Horibe, 
who is currently in the ISDA office in NYC at 212-332-1271 is planning on 
moving to Japan to open the office.  Give her a call and get more details.  
Get back to me if you don't get the info you need.   

Rgards,

Mark,

Would any of your colleagues be interested in speaking in Singapore in
September on the Global Energy Derivatives Market (see the attached
invitation).  None of the ISDA staff can speak at this conference because
our September Board meeting will be held the same week.

Joe Hartsoe, Rick Shapiro, or Jim Steffes can fill you in on the details of 
what FERC did today.  One question you need to think about is how their 
decision on price caps affects any contracts which we may have indexed to 
California's spot market.  The way it reports the market clearing price will 
change fundamentally if prices over 150 will be accepted but not used to 
clear the market for all bids.  So, if we are using this as a reference price 
in our contracts it may trigger the need to look for alternatives.

USA: FACTBOX-FERC details changes for Calif power market.

11/01/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
on Wednesday approved several actions to revamp California's power market 
over the next two years. 
Immediate changes include the following:
* Eliminate requirement that three utilities - Pacific Gas & Electric, San 
Diego Power and SoCal Edison - must sell all of their power to and buy all 
their power from the state Power Exchange (PX). 
* Require market participants to schedule 95 percent of their transactions in 
the day-ahead markets to reduce chronic underscheduling of load and 
generation and over-reliance on the ISO's real-time imbalance market to meet 
supply. FERC also proposed a penalty charge for scheduling deviations in 
excess of 5 percent of hourly load requirements. 
* Temporary modification of the single-price auction so bids above $150 MWh 
cannot set the market clearing price paid to all bidders. 
* Establish independent, non-stakeholder governing boards for the California 
Power Exchange (PX) and Independent System Operator (ISO). 
* Create congestion management design proposal. 
* Establish generation inter-connection procedures. 
* Explore alternatives to the single price auction by the ISO and PX. 
* Develop market rules to ensure sufficient supply is available to meet load 
and reserve requirements. 
FERC also approved changes to protect wholesale customers from unreasonable 
rates during the time it will take to adopt longer-term market remedies. The 
following price mitigation measures will remain in effect until Dec. 31, 
2002: 
* Single-price auctions for all sales in the ISO and PX markets at or below 
$150 MWh. The single price would be used for all load which clears below this 
amount in the auction. 
* If an auction does not clear below the $150 MWh level, suppliers who choose 
to bid above $150 would be paid their price bid. In other words, the highest 
bid of the day, if above $150 per MWh, would no longer be the clearing price 
paid by all. 
* Sellers receiving above $150 per MWh would be required to report their bids 
to FERC on a weekly basis and provide certain cost information to the agency. 
* The ISO and PX would be required to report monthly information on such 
bids, allowing FERC to monitor competitive conditions and assure just and 
reasonable rates. Sellers would be subject to potential refund liability but 
no lower than their marginal or opportunity cost if FERC finds 
non-competitive conditions. The potential refund liability would extend the 
full 24 months it would take to implement the market reforms.

Not clear at this point.  No deals have been done.  My guess is that it will 
be Lance and his group.  I will let you know when it gets sorted out.  Mark

Mark, who within the Enron legal group is responsible for Enron Excelerator?  
>From what I've heard about this initiative, it sounds like it may be doing 
deals similar to what we've done for Enron in the past.  We'd love to get the

Mark and Rob:

   I finally finished the highly scientific process of dividing up the
tickets.  The methodology I used is as follows:

   (1) We each ended up with one exhibition game.

   (2) The two of you expressed a preference for weekend nights.  There
are 12 Friday and Saturday games, so I gave each of you six.

   (3)  I tried to give you games where you will not be out of town
(although I ended up giving each of you one game where both of you will be
out of town).

   (4) I divided the teams into good teams (Trailblazers, Jazz, Heat,
Spurs, Lakers,  Knicks, Pacers and Sonics), medium teams (Timberwolves,
Hornets, Kings, 76ers, Cavaliers, Suns, Celtics and Nets) and bad teams
(Bulls, Pistons, Grizzlies, Wizards, Magic, Clippers, Mavericks, Bucks,
Nuggets, Warriors, Raptors and Hawks), and I tried to divide the teams so
that there was a realtively even distribution of team levels. Mark ended up
with 5-7-6, Rob with 6-3-9 and I ended up with 2-1-2.  Although Rob has one
more good team than Mark has, he get to see more dogs.  I am not 100%
certain that I have a good handle on whose going to be good, mediocre and
bad, and there were some teams that might be bad but I put in a medium
category because they are interesting (e.g. 76ers, Celtics and Nets).

   (5) Finally, I attempted to minimize the repeats.  But it ended up
that Mark has the Timberwolves and Grizzlies  twice, and Rob has the
Warriors and Nuggets twice.

   And, of course, if you don't like what I did you can always trade.
   
   This was a highly scientific process, done with the aid of Lotus
1-2-3.

Mark: please note that I have given you Tuesday night's tickets vs. the
Lakers.

Dad:

The name I have is Dr. Vinberg.  He is a therapist in Houston and is in his 
80s.  I talked to him today and I thought he seemed good.  He recommended 
that we meet for two hours on one day and schedule some time the next day if 
it is productive.  His number is 713-622-1441.  He charges $150 per hour and 
I will pick that up as you would be incurring expenses to come to Houston.  
Give him a call and see if he is acceptable to you.  If he is, I will propose 
dates and we can see if they work for everyone. 

Love,  

Mark

Mark,

Thanks for a great presentation today.
I have already received several comments 
from people saying how much they enjoyed it.

I've attached a few orchid shots.
In fact, I will be showing them all on Saturday.
My photo organization, Houston Center for Photography is sponsoring a print 
sale.
It is from 10 am to 6 pm this Sat. at 1441 Alabama (near the Menil).

Hope you have a great weekend.
Thanks again.

Frazier

Mark -

I'm attaching the March report for EGA.  I understand that the length is 
still probably more than you want -- we will keep working on winnowing it 
down.  I tended to leave in more discussion of troubled projects like SECLP 
and Dabhol.

I hope all is well.  I've been on the road for some time and am currently in 
Singapore.  I'm likely to head back to Bombay for at least the first few days 
of next week.

As you know, Donahue E&Y has been doing work for us lately, so far on the 
retail, regulatory, and general corporate fronts.  I also believe they have 
the ability to work for us in a broader capacity.  E&Y is generally among the 
best situated for the coming deregulated power market.  E&Y set up many of 
our systems in Toronto and Donahue E&Y is currently assisting us on the 
wholesale side with Ontario Energy Finance Corporation (one of the 
deregulation off-shoots of Ontario Hydro) on finalizing the NUG management 
arrangement.  They are also very strong on tax, and may be able to assist 
non-ECC business units (i.e. Global Markets and EES) in Canadian 
initiatives.  Representatives of their firm are considering a trip to Houston 
in the Spring and asked me if they could visit with you and others within 
Enron in Houston.  I told them that we would be pleased, once the timing is 
right.  Once they have a date I will let you know to see if we can set 
something up. Peter.

I think the RFP looks great.  The one question I had was whether or not we 
wanted to put in the RFP our objective in terms of income from the facility.  
Also, should we encourage joint bids?  Take care.

Mark -

I won't be able to attend the EWS Legal Monday meeting due to Dabhol but 
thought that I would give you a couple of updates:

I think that we have Francisco squared away -- Coralina is back from vacation 
this week.  If I can get some of Coralina's time for Puerto Rico, I feel 
covered on Central America/Carribean.

Miguel Mendoza is back from vacation this coming week as well.  I don't have 
a good feel for South America yet but think that I do now for the rest of 
Global Assets (APACHI, CALME and India).  I'm delaying my trip to India to 
spend some time with Miguel next week.

Dabhol is still pretty much the center of the Global Assets universe.  I have 
nothing to add to my Friday update that I sent to you.

I hope all is well.

Bruce

Mark,
This article confirms your skepticism about the CDWR deal.  Davis is already 
planning to violate confidentiality provisions of CDWR contracts signed 
earlier this year.  The State of California simply cannot be trusted to honor 
its agreements.  
Look at Davis's spin on breaching contract provisions:  State negotiators 
"worried little about the [confidentiality] clauses" in their haste to sign 
the contracts, but now, "administration officials insisted they are 
attempting to find a way around the secrecy clauses in long-term contracts."
>From here it is a very small step for Davis to justify breaking long-term 
contracts once prices go down in a year or two:  "We didn't think a lot about 
the prices we were paying at the time because we were just trying to keep the 
lights on.  But now we are attempting to find a way around the payment 
clause."
* * *
On another note, thank you for meeting with me on Wednesday.  I am thrilled 
to be working for Enron.  Meeting with you, Jim Derrick, and others in the 
legal department reinforced my decision to join your company.  I am excited 
about our prospects for the future and will work hard to continue to add 
value and keep your confidence.

Best regards,
Steve

Davis to divulge details of costly energy buys 
By Steve Geissinger
SACRAMENTO BUREAU 
SACRAMENTO -- Amid mounting attacks on Gov. Gray Davis' energy-crisis 
secrecy, administration officials said Thursday they will soon begin 
revealing full details of the state's costly, last-minute power purchases 
aimed at thwarting blackouts. 
The Davis administration told ANG Newspapers that in the next two weeks it 
will start disclosing information on the initial, multimillion-dollar 
purchases it made on the volatile spot market in January. 
In doing so, the administration will begin honoring Davis' promise to reveal 
the details after a period of six months or less. The governor said 
disclosing the information any earlier would compromise efforts to hold down 
power costs. 
But there has been a growing chorus of protest of the secrecy from 
open-government advocates, consumer activists, Republican lawmakers and 
others. 
GOP legislators and news agencies have filed separate lawsuits, under the 
state's Public Records Act, seeking disclosure of details on about $8 billion 
in emergency, short-term purchases and additional billions on less costly, 
years-long contracts. 
A San Diego Superior Court judge is scheduled to issue initial rulings on the 
lawsuits today in San Diego. 
On Thursday, the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights called on 
Californians to phone the governor's office in protest. 
"The public has a right to know how our money is being spent and who is 
getting it," said Harvey Rosenfield, the group's director. 
The governor "won't let us look at them (contracts) to make sure they won't 
cause further rate hikes in future years," Rosenfield said. 
"It is also important to know how much power he has negotiated for this 
summer so we can determine how much it will cost us to stop the blackouts," 
he said. "We believe the governor is refusing to divulge because the 
contracts are inflated and contain damaging provisions." 
Administration officials dismissed critics' assertions and said that full 
disclosure will eventually come when the data is no longer a sensitive 
marketing matter. 
Officials acknowledged for the first time, however, that some of the state's 
less costly, long-term power contracts with generators contain secrecy 
clauses that may prevent public disclosure. 
The administration said state negotiators were so intent on securing less 
expensive, long-term power supplies that authorities worried little about the 
clauses requiring them to keep terms of the contracts secret unless they have 
the suppliers' permission to divulge them 
Though violating the agreement could void the contracts, industry 
representatives said they doubted generators would break existing pacts. 
Suppliers might, however, sign no more contracts with the state, the 
representatives said. 
"Apparently there are some contracts with that (secrecy clause), and our 
legal people are looking at it," said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. "I 
don't know what the end result is going to be, but it's the governor's intent 
to release the contracts." 
While administration officials insisted they are attempting to find a way 
around the secrecy clauses in long-term contracts, they said disclosure of 
the initial short-term purchases will soon begin. 
Maviglio said the administration will start posting the details of 
short-term, spot-market buys made in mid-January within the next two weeks on 
the Internet, easing a controversy that has enveloped two of Davis' fellow 
Democratic statewide elected officials. 
State Controller Kathleen Connell scrapped plans to reveal the costly state 
power bills in February during a dramatic, 11th-hour reversal under pressure 
from the Davis administration. 
The controller, who has emerged as a sharp critic of the administration's 
handling of the energy crisis, indefinitely postponed plans to put 
information from electricity-purchase invoices on the Internet and canceled a 
news conference to announce the disclosures. 
In March, Attorney General Bill Lockyer, representing Davis in this instance, 
provided Connell with a letter of advice that the governor is not legally 
bound to reveal the details of billions of dollars in state power purchases. 
Lockyer's letter said the public's interest in maintaining confidentiality in 
matters relating to negotiations between the state and prospective power 
contractors far outweighed its interest in disclosure. 
But Lockyer, a former East Bay politician, said last week he personally 
favors making public the details of the purchases. 
"In my mind at least, and as a matter of philosophy, the expenditures are so 
extraordinary, the issues are so important, that the contracts ... need to be 
made public," he said at the annual meeting of the National Freedom of 
Information Coalition. 
Open-government advocates point to a recent poll conducted for the California 
First Amendment Coalition that indicates seven out of 10 Californians believe 
they are getting too little information about how state officials are 
responding to the power shortage, and a whopping 86 percent want details of 
long-term power purchasing contracts made public. 
"Californians reject government secrecy as a matter of law in the state's 
Open Government Act," said Kent Pollock, the coalition's executive director. 
"The poll results are an overwhelming repudiation of state policies that 
shield information from public scrutiny."

Enron has complained about the quality of the information given to Inside 
FERC.  It is my understanding that requesting the counterparty data is a due 
diligence step that the trades really happened and that Inside FERC keeps the 
name of the counterparty confidential.  We want the data to be as good as 
possible.  If my assumptions are correct, I come out -- give the name of the 
counterparty with stated limitations.  Jeff Hodge, please let me know if my 
assumptions are correct in the US.

		 Subject: Sumas Index

Mark, our contracts at Sumas (which is a U.S. border delivery point in 
British Columbia) are settled against the Inside F.E.R.C. Sumas Index.  
Inside F.E.R.C. is now requiring that, in addition to pure trading data, we 
must also provide counterparty identification.  On the basis that we cannot 
provide that counterparty identification, both due to contractual obligations 
and business policies/practices, our information was excluded from the Sumas 
Index for the last index period.  I know, for example, in negotiating the 
settlement with NGX, that the provision of counterparty identification was a 
matter of very serious concern, particularly for Andy Zipper who manages EOL.

However, I am advised by Jon McKay that, notwithstanding these apparent 
contractual restrictions and business policies/practices, Houston provides 
counterparty identifications to Inside F.E.R.C.

The problem is that if we do not provide these counterparty identifications, 
our information will be excluded from the Sumas Index, which is particularly 
problematic with Sumas already being a relatively illiquid point.  On the 
other hand, if we do provide counterparty identification, we run the risk of 
breaching confidentiality obligations, business policies/practices and 
upsetting our trading counterparties.

I guess we have two alternatives, one is to continue to not disclose 
counterparty identifications and hope that Inside F.E.R.C. will change its 
view on this (although, as I mentioned, their position is that Houston 
provides them with that information), or provide counterparty identifications 
at the risk of getting offside our counterparties.

My preference would be to do the former, but I think this is a matter you may 
want to review with Lavo and let me know how Houston intends to proceed.

Regards,
Peter

Three things:

I attach a copy of the memo on the federal electronic signature law that we 
discussed this morning.  Mark and I will discuss with Alan his original 
proposal of adding a footer to company emails and get back to the group.  
Until then no footer will be added.  

With respect to Paulette, I understand that each of you agree to bear your 
proportionate share of her cost for the budget year 2000--although the basis 
of that allocation is still to be agreed.  

Finally, we agreed to discuss what projects we would like for our technology 
committee to undertake.  I propose that we discuss this topic during next 
Thursday's meeting--since Jim will be out of town we can have this meeting in 
lieu of the regular meeting.  I think having this discussion now would be 
helpful and I think the technology group would greatly benefit from the 
meeting as well.  Let me know if that is acceptable to you.  

Thanks.

As I mentioned at our last meeting, we have been working with issues of 
electronic contracts and signatures in Global Finance, especially in the 
development, implementation and ongoing operations of the DealBench Internet 
site.  Vinson & Elkins has been working with us on DealBench and related 
e-commerce matters.  Attached for your information is a V&E memorandum on 
electronic contracts and signatures under federal, Delaware, New York, Texas 
and certain uniform laws.  

As a postscript to the meeting minutes circulated today, Enron Corp., some of 
its affiliated entities and third parties successfully are using the 
DealBench site for various types of transactions.  

Let me know if I can help or provide additional information on any of these 
matters.

Dear Mike,

Per direction from Cathy Phillips, here is the information about The Patent & 
License Exchange (pl-x), and its potential role in Enron's 
e-commerce/exchange initiative.

The Patent & License Exchange, Inc. (www.pl-x.com), since Jan 1999 has been 
the operator of the safest global marketplace for intellectual property 
rights.  pl-x promotes liquidity in the market through novel 
financially-oriented content and risk transfer tools backed by world-class 
companies. Strategic partners include Ernst & Young, Swiss Re, and Chicago 
Title Company (NYSE: FNF).  pl-x's most recent round of financing brought in 
$30 million in March, from a 10-member syndicate including Softbank, 
Polytechnos, Texas Pacific Group and TMCT Ventures.  The Board of Directors 
includes the most recent Commissioner of the US Patent and Trademark Office, 
Bruce Lehman and former Managing Director of Mitsubishi Electric Company, 
Takashi Kiuchi.  Subscribers include Avery Dennison, Dow Chemical, 
Bristol-Myers Squibb, Mallinckrodt, Aventis, Gateway, Honeywell, and over 190 
others.

pl-x also just received the Forbes.com "Best of the Web" award:

http://www.forbesbest.com/b2b/asp/tearsheet.asp?reviewNO=1738&industry=Miscell
aneous

Enron's leadership role in the growth of online exchanges is becoming clear.  
We believe leadership in the Intellectual Property Asset Exchange space would 
be consistent with Enron's vision, and we look forward to speaking about ways 
of potentially working together.

Very best regards,
Alex Arrow

I had a brief conversation with Vicki about splitting the costs 50/50 on the 
legal side to be consistent with the business arrangement.  She asked to use 
the European operation as  a model.  At some point, Peter you should just 
give Vicki a call and talk it through.

		 Subject: Retail Initiative

To be brief, this project is percolating but being held up on the following 
fronts:  

1.  ENA/EES issues.  I have not been involved so I don't know where it is 
at.  As request by Dave P., Mark P. has sent a copy of his preliminary issues 
memo to Vicki S.  

2.  Market Achievement Plan for unsold PPAs.  The Government is expected to 
announce October 31st.  This will impact the market in many aspects, 
including the viability of competitive retail market options v. regulated 
rate options.  

3.  We have proposals from two law firms.  Donahue Ernst & Young and Blakes.  
My preference would be DEY for diversification reasons, but DEY may have 
unresolvable conflicts which I would have to discuss with you if we are to 
proceed.  Blakes proposal may also have significant conflicts, which may be 
resolvable but which may limit the effectiveness of their representation.  
Nonetheless, it seems a decision will not need to be made until the end of 
October.  In the meantime, Mark P. is working on scoping out legal and 
compliance issues, as well as forms.

Peter.

Dear Mark,

As per this letter from Bob Pickel, I wonder if you (assuming you are Enron's 
"Primary ISDA contact") would be able to send me our Firm ID and password 
when you have a chance so that I can access the online versions of the

Thanks very much and thanks for the card.  Hoping you and your family had a 
happy holiday and wishing you all the best for 2001.

We have purchased 30 copies of the referenced book.  It is a short read -- 
about 30-45 minutes.  The copies are located at the clerks' station, EB3808.  
Please read this short story prior to our ENA Legal Conference and then 
return it to the clerks' station so everyone attending the conference will

the targeted membership and the organization has been very successful in
Dallas.  Led by several local GC and supported by only a few large law and
accounting firms, the Houston effort is just beginning.  Current
participants include Chase, Reliant Energy, Compaq, Texaco, Equiva, American
General, Sterling Bankshares and others.

 A breakfast meeting is scheduled for June 13 at the Doubletree in Allen
Center at 8:00 a.m. in the Granger A conference room.  Each organizer is
inviting two guests and I hope you can be one of mine.  Of course,  we would
also like Jim to participate and membership is open to all GC or their
direct reports in a company. Vince may visit with Jim about this group.

I have copied below a blurb desciribing the TGCF and membership plans. Let
me know by phone or email.  Thank you very much.

I just got back form 6 rounds of golf in 3 days at the Inn of the Mountain
Gods in Ruidoso. And a little time in the casino. Have you played there? My
game can be desrcibed as " arguably improving early beginner", says the rest
of the foursome.

                                             The Texas General Counsel Forum
is an organization whose mission is to
                                             facilitate communication and
information sharing among general counsel and
                                             outside counsel of best
practices for legal department management and for
                                             effective communication between
the legal department and executive
                                             management. Membership is open
to general counsel and their direct reports
                                             with management responsibility
for legal affairs of their companies, and
                                             to select outside counsel who
provide services to corporate legal departments.
                                             Directors and members of the
Forum will be present to discuss the
                                             organization's goals, purpose
and activities. Information about
                                             up -coming events and
membership applications will be available.

Bob:

I think Enron is more  likely to use the intranet service.  I was unclear 
however, if additional service was available in the internet service, such as 
links to the explanatory books?  I think generally we would want the 
convenience of having the ISDA materials inside for use by any Enron 
employee.  If the cost gets too high, I don't think members will pay for it.  
$10,000 sounds ok to me.

Regards,

Mark

Subject: Credit Markets Group Organisational Announcement.


We are pleased to announce the formation of the Credit Markets Group which is 
responsible for developing innovative products to better manage the risk of 
our internal credit portfolio as well as, looking  for opportunities to 
provide third party credit protection.  Initially, we will be making markets 
in bankruptcy protection on reference credits which are currently in our 
portfolio but we expect to add additional credit products and reference 
credits very quickly.

The team will utilise EnronOnline as its primary trade execution tool, 
looking to quickly build market share by capturing the eyes of our current 
counterparts.  Simultaneously,  we will launch an external web site focused 
on credit protection where potential customers will have access to real time 
prices and filter on specific reference credits as well as, access to credit 
models and research papers on effective credit risk management.  Utilising 
e-commerce business principles, we expect to aggressively claim the space for 
corporate credit protection.  We expect to make a public announcement about 
these new products in late January.

In order to effectively access the global market for credit protection, the 
group will be based in London with an initial local desk set up in Houston as 
well.  Bryan Seyfried will be transitioning out of RAC, where he was 
responsible for the Trading Controls and Research teams in Europe, to lead 
the group and he will report to me.

Great conference in Amsterdam.  It was the best one yet.  I would like to 
have an IDSA sponsored energy conference in Houston sometime in the next 
year.  I think the time will be ripe to focus on (a)  energy derivatives 
around the world and (b) the application of web technology to energy.   If we 
do it right, we may draw a large group internationally and build our 
membership dramatically.  Let me know what you think.

Regards,

Mark

Please provide your comments to me as soon as you can.  The most important 
thing at this point is to make sure I have the business correctly described.  
I am working on the letter of intent now.  We will have to decide how 
detailed you want the term sheet and loi.  I would think you would want it 
fairly general for your first few meetings until we get feedback.  Let me 
know.

Mark

There are a lot of art galleries in Sao Paulo, but I am not sure what you 
like.  The place I was telling you about is Galeria Jacques Ardies.  Jacques' 
gallery is one of the two best (I think) specializing in contemporary 
Brazilian "naif" artists.  Most of his stuff is really interesting, vibrant, 
"Brazilian" pieces (many from the Northeast of Brazil where they have the 
greatest African influence and a very rich culture).  Kind of funky and "out 
there,"  but I really like it.  He also has some terrific textile works by 
Madeleine Colaco, an artist who has become very popular in the United States 
(we have one of her wall hangings in our den).

Jacques' web site is at http://ardies.com/quemingl.htm.  I don't think it is 
very representative of what you will find there, but take a look.

There are plenty of other galleries that you can go to as well. Let's talk 
about what you want to see on the way down, and I will give it some thought.

By the way,  I am scheduled to have lunch with Lance on Thursday, and I have 
a phone call into Alan asking for a time with him as well.  I will keep you 
posted.

Regards,
Randy

		 Subject: Plan B Auction - Need for Approvals ?

Mark, thanks for the voice mail.  In terms of a risk memo, I agree that one 
should not be necessary as in many respects this can be characterized as 
normal course trading within position limits under a standardized Master 
Agreement and without an outlay of capital, but hopefully the following 
(together with my memo from last night - copy attached) suffices to the 
extent a risk memo is required.

In terms of unusual risks:

1.  We do not have any rights to collateral under the proposed Master.  
However, the counterparty is the Balancing Pool which is essentially 
Government of Alberta credit risk.  Derek Davies is I believe dealing with 
Credit to resolve credit issues.  In fact, I believe the Balancing Pool is 
taking significant risk as it is selling the power firm under a Master which 
does not match up to the interruptible nature of the PPAs it holds.

2.  The Balancing Pool will be secured under the Master by a parental 
guarantee of Enron Corp. and has a somewhat discretionary right to call for 
collateral from us under the Master if there is a material change in Enron 
Corp.'s creditworthiness.

3.  It is a requirement of the auction that we will have entered into 
back-to-back physical hedges for 70% of the volume we acquire, and we are 
currently working at putting those deals in place conditional on us bidding 
and being successful in the auction.  Penalties can be imposed if 70% of the 
volume purchased is not properly hedged.

4.  As we are dealing with the Government of Alberta, we always run the risk 
(as we are somewhat seeing now with respect to the Sundance PPA we acquired 
in the first auction) that they can change the auction rules, the market 
rules or the legislation in ways that are adverse to us.  In terms of the 
auction rules, as with the first auction, they could be better drafted, but 
our fundamental concern will be to make sure that it is clear that if we post 
a bid deposit and do not bid that we get the deposit back, and to ensure that 
the rules are clear enough that we are comfortable that we are in complete 
control of whether or not we can comply with the rules.

Peter.

(Milly, sorry for not copying you on my first memo - see below.)

Subject: Plan B Auction - Need for Approvals ?

Mark, as I have mentioned to you the Plan B Alberta Power Auction is 
scheduled for Nov 29/00, under which Enron Canada can purchase for one-year 
terms, in each of three successive years, up to approximately 300MW/year #1;  
130MW/year #2; and 65MW/year #3, of the unsold PPA capacity that reverted 
back to the Balancing Pool of Alberta following the first auction last 
August.  The bid qualification documentation needs to be in Friday and US 
Thanksgiving is Thursday/Friday.  I wanted you to be aware of this, and 
determine from you if any corporate approvals need to be obtained.

Firstly, Derek Davies/John Zufferli will only be bidding to the extent 
authorized by Lavo.

Secondly, bid qualification commits us to the rules of the auction, the forms 
of documentation to govern both the auction and the purchase if we are 
successful, and requires a bid deposit (approximately C$6.5MM), but does not 
obligate us to bid and, provided we comply with the auction rules, the Bid 
Deposit will be returned after the auction.

Thirdly, unlike the PPA auction the risks are much less significant in terms 
of volume and term.  In terms of documentation, if we are the successful 
bidder, we will be buying power from the Balancing Pool under a physical 
Master, which seems to be a Canadianized version of the EEI Master and which, 
although not entirely to our liking, is generally satisfactory.

Fourthly, the position will, I understand, be managed in the power trading 
book within approved position limits.  Note:  The nominal amounts owing (i.e. 
no up front payment is required) on an unhedged basis for the entire 300MWs 
in year #1 would be something like C$260MM, assuming a C$100/MW purchase 
price.  Year #2 would be C$114MM and year #3 would be C$57MM.

Given the nature of the transaction, the short time that we have with US 
Thanksgiving intervening, and numerous other demands, I do not believe that a 
DASH, Risk Memo and/or Board Approval is necessary, but please let me know.

I will leave you a brief voice mail to follow-up.

Peter.

I am looking for some additional general corporate outside legal assistance 
in the LA area (at a more reasonable rate than is charged by Milbank, 
Tweed).  I have come into contact with two former Milbank lawyers who are now 
at McDermott, Will & Emery.  We were impressed with their work in the past 
and believe that they can provide us with prompt, reasonably priced, top 
quality general corporate legal assistance.  McDermott has represented Enron 
Trading Systems and EBS.  Is this an acceptable firm for me to hire?  Thanks,

Per our discussion yesterday Marty I've been asked to check on two issues
regarding Enron.  First an attorney in our Philadelphia office has been asked
to do some work for Wiser Oil Company as follows.  Wiser is acquiring the
stock of a Canadian Corporation called Invasion Energy.  Enron Canada owns
about 50% of the stock of Invasion.  Wiser has Canadian counsel who has asked
us to work with them.  Enron Canada is represented by Bennett Jones LLP.
Although we don't do any work for Enron Canada, I thought I needed to see if
anyone at Enron had any problems with Reed Smith getting involved in this
transaction as stated above.  I'm told an answer to this one ASAP would be
nice.

Second question is a little more confusing.  An attorney in our New York 
office
has been asked by a broker for Enron Global Services to get involved in
negotiating a financial guarantee insurance agreement about providing
insurance coverage for Winterthur International.  We would be representing
Winterthur in the transaction.  I can get more information if needed.

Thanks for checking on these Marty.  Let me know

I sent the e-mail below to our lawyers in ENA Legal.

 In order to provide better oversight and control of ENA legal expenditures 
on large transactions, please continue to follow the procedures set forth 
below for transactions where outside legal fees and expenses are expected to 
exceed $25,000.00.  The purpose of these procedures is to (i) improve 
communication with counsel (inside and outside) on issues, fees and services 
and (ii) send price signals on legal costs (with respect to specific 
transactions) on a timely basis to the business units.  Every effort should 
be made to continue to provide high quality legal work that has become 
standard at ENA.

 1.  A written estimate of proposed fees and expenses and a written 
description of the services shall be provided by our outside counsel.  The 
responsible business unit and the General Counsel shall review and approve 
such written estimate before our outside counsel is directed to provide 
substantial professional services.

 2.  Our outside counsel shall be instructed to promptly submit a revised 
written estimate if such outside counsel determines that legal fees and 
expenses for such transaction will exceed the previous written estimate by 
$25,000.00.  Such revised written estimate shall be reviewed and approved by 
the responsible business unit and the General Counsel or his/her designee 
before our outside counsel is directed to provide substantial additional 
professional services. 

 3.  In order to accurately track such expenses so that the expenses can be 
properly allocated to the various business units, a work order number should 
be obtained for each transaction.  

 Thank you for your cooperation.  If you have any questions or any other 
suggestions for controlling expenses, please call me at extension 36544.

		 Subject: Re: Elektro's telecom project

For what it is worth, I agree with Sami's concern that we may laboring under 
a false sense of security in assuming that a foreign arbitration provision in 
a Brazilian contract, between Brazilian contracting parties relating to a 
Brazilian matter in controversy would be easily enforced by a Brazilian 
court.  Inevitably, we have to fight hard for these "concessions" in our 
negotiations and end up leaving a lot of Enron consideration (not to mention 
blood and sweat) on the table to get these provisions inserted in our 
contracts.  If we are really being "taken" by these crafty Brazilian lawyers 
(like the former General Counsel of the Odebrecht Group), I think we should 
re-think the policy in this specific instance.

Elektro, because it is the fifth largest electricity LDC in Brazil, has a 
long history of litigation in the Sao Paulo courts (we had a number of cases, 
you will recall, when we bought it, and have had others since). It is clearly 
not the only substantial, high-profile Brazilian company Enron has down here, 
making it a little hard for us to negotiate these provisions as "foreigners"  
the way we do elsewhere.  

By all means we should check with Jose Emilio, but if he shares Sami's (and, 
I have to say, my) concerns, I think we should consider making a special rule 
for Brazil-to-Brazil contracting transactions.  Perhaps we could have the 
first position be ICC arbitration in Sao Paulo (in English?), with a forum 
savings clause that states that if the arbitration provision is held 
unenforceable that the litigation will be in the courts (federal, if 
possible) of Sao Paulo.  The worst thing that could happen is that we enter 
into an arbitration provision, thinking we are safe, and end up in some court 
in a smaller city in a backwater part of Brazil where they are a little loose 
on the law and perhaps even looser on the concepts of justice, due process, 
etc.

If you would like me to be involved in the further discussions, let me know.

Randy

Subject: Re: Elektro's telecom project  

Thanks again, Bob.

I will call Jos, Emilio to check.  I agree that a foreign arbitral award is 
enforceable in Brazil (whether international or local aspects are under 
discussion) provided that you follow the "exequatur" procedure at the 
Brazilian Supreme Court.  I have personally participated in the enforcement 
of a foreign arbital award against Odebrecht a few years ago.

However, the point I am raising is that in case one of the two Brazilian 
contracting entities challenge such foreign arbitration clause and refer the 
matter under dispute to a local court, it is most likely that the Brazilian 
judge will accept jurisdiction and review the case, in accordance with 
Article 88 (I)(II)(III) of the Brazilian Civil Procedure Code.  In such 
event, if Enron (please note that I am always & only referring to an Enron 
Brazilian entity) agrees to a foreign arbitration clause with a Brazilian 
counterparty, it may end up resolving its contractual disputes at the 
Brazilian courts (and this is exactly what I am trying to avoid by suggesting 
ICC arbitration in S?o Paulo for all contracts entered into between two 
Brazilian entities).

Even if the two Brazilian contracting entities refer the matter under dispute 
to foreign arbitration and, at the same time or at a later stage, one of the 
parties decide to challenge the foreign arbitration clause and refer the 
matter to the local courts, it is most likely that the Brazilian Supreme 
Court will recognize the local courts jurisdiction and decide that the 
foreign arbitration clause was null and void.

I will be in Houston on Friday, January 26, and would very much appreciate 
the opportunity to discuss this matter in detail with you and possibly with 
Rob Walls and/or Jim Derrick.

Regards,

Sami

Subject: Re: Elektro's telecom project  

Sami,

I agree on the issue of Brazilian law.  But on the question of foreign 
arbitration, our advice has been that such a clause will be enforced by the 
local courts, even if the dispute has no international aspects other than the 
parent is foreign (although there was a dissenting opinion from one lawyer on 
this issue).   Could you check this point with Jose Emilio Pinto at Tozzini 
or Fernando Serec?  As to local arbitration, we have accepted this where the 
dollar amount of the disputes is likely to be less than $500,000.  We should 
probably also have a cumulative cap of, say, $5 million.   On bigger deals, 
Rob orJim have resisted local court jurisdiction.  The most flexible they 
have been to my knowledge where more $ is at stake is to agree to 
ICC-administered arbitration in Sao Paulo.  In this case, I think we should 
propose the local arbitration procedure which would is best calculated to 
result in an impartial award, whether that be ad hoc, ICC, FIESP, or 
Canadian-Brazilian C of C.  Jose Emilio would have a view on this, too.  Hope 
this is helpful.

Bob

Michelle and Bob;

Thanks for the reply.  The issue here is when Brazilian entities (only) are 
entering into a contract which obligations will only be performed in Brazil 
and such agreement is governed by Brazilian laws.  My understanding of the 
Enron arbitration policy (and please correct me if I am wrong) is that when 
Enron (as a foreign company) is dealing with foreign governments, 
governmental agencies or government-owned companies, or private companies 
from the host company, we must follow our internal policy by choosing 
preferred arbitration rules, preferred place of arbitration and preferred 
governing law.

In case of Elektro, as well as any other Brazilian Enron entity (EAS, ECE 
etc), entering into a contract with another Brazilian party with obligations 
to be performed in Brazil, such contract will most likely be governed by 
Brazilian laws.  Although the parties are in principle able to select a 
foreign law in Brazil, the contracting parties must comply with local public 
policy.  I strongly advise that two or more Brazilian parties contracting 
obligations in Brazil agree that the respective contract be governed by the 
laws of Brazil.

With respect to the dispute resolution mechanism, we are all aware of Enron's 
policy to avoid referring disputes to the Brazilian courts.  In case of the 
above mentioned Elektro deal, the idea is to submit all contract 
controversies to arbitration under ICC rules in S?o Paulo.  To me, the 
question is whether we use "ad hoc" arbitration OR institutional arbitration 
(i.e. submit the matter to FIESP or the Canadian-Brazilian Chamber of 
Commerce to act as the "arbitration administrator").

FYI since I joined Enron, I've been told that all of Enron's Brazilian 
entities should use foreign arbitration as their contracts' dispute 
resolution mechanism.  In my opinion, this concept may not work the way Enron 
wants.  If the local Enron entity is dealing with another Brazilian party and 
(suppose) both parties have agreed to use ICC arbitration in NY, it is most 
likely that, in case the Brazilian counterparty decides to refer the matter 
under dispute to the Brazilian courts, the local judge will accept 
jurisdiction and review the case.  You may ask "why".  The reason is because 
there are two Brazilian parties contracting obligations to be performed in 
Brazil under the laws of Brazil; as a consequence a local judge will accept 
jurisdiction.

I'd very much like to emphasize that, while working as General Counsel of the 
Odebrecht Group, I use to accept foreign arbitration clauses in contracts 
entered with Affiliates of foreign companies because I knew that, at the end 
of the day, I could always challenge the dispute resolution mechanism agreed 
in the contract and refer the matter to the local courts.  Since Odebrecht's 
counterparties did not do their homework properly ...

Arbitration was first introduced in Brazil through the Federal Constitution 
of 1824.  The Civil Code of 1916 ractified the use of arbitration, however, 
it obliged the arbitral award to be reviewed by the local courts.  Only in 
1996, with the issuance of the Brazilian Arbitration Act (Law 9307), it was 
recognized the use of arbitration as a definitive dispute resolution 
mechanism without having to submit the final arbitral award to the review of 
the local courts.

With respect to enforceability, please note that the arbitral award is final, 
binding and enforceable towards the contracting parties.  Only in case a 
Party decides not to comply with the final arbital award, the other Party may 
refer the arbitral award to a local judge to obtain an "exequatur".

Please feel free to contact me at the earliest possible convenience to 
continue to discuss this arbitration matter.

Rgds,

Sami

Definitely we do not want to submit to the local courts.  Do suggest ICC

Subject: Elektro's telecom project


	

Elektro is participating in the negotiation of a telecom project to form a 
SPC among Elektro and four other LDCs (Bandeirante, CPFL, CTEEP and EPTE).  
The SPC will be named "SP Telecom".  SP Telecom will develop 
telecommunication services using the LDCs' infra-structure.  After SP 
Telecom's formation, an investor will be selected to purchase the majority of 
the company's shares.  Elektro will have a 5% participation in SP Telecom and 
this deal will generate approximately US$10MM in revenues for Elektro.

The Parties have been discussing a draft MOU for several months, however, 
this matter came to my attention only a few weeks ago.  The MOU has been 
reviewed by all Parties and is currently on final rounds of negotiation.

There is one pending issue which I need to discuss with you before I get Jim 
Derrick's sign-off.  CTEEP and EPTE (state and private owned LDCs) have 
requested that the MOU, as well as any other SP Telecom project agreement, 
includes a dispute resolution mechanism through the courts of S?o Paulo.  I 
have discussed this matter with Jose Margalith (Elektro's in-house counsel) 
and Randy Young, and have suggest Margalith to offer ICC arbitration at FIESP 
(the S?o Paulo State Industries Federation) as an alternative.

Orlando Gonzalez asked me to assist him to resolve this pending issue at the 
earliest possible convenience.  Any thoughts or ideas ?  Please feel free to 
call me (55-11-5503-1226).

Tks for your assistance to this matter.

		 Subject: FCEL

Guys, I have spoken to Cliff and Mark and we are comfortable moving forward 
under the structure we have discussed.

 FCEL: - $5MM in equity and 1.3MM warrants from corporate treasury stock that 
vest based upon 60MW of orders;
  - discussion with FCEL in which we disclose ALL infromation we have about 
the potential Conn. deal - I will require that myself and Mark be on   that 
call;
  - the transaction is fully press released immediately.

 CRRA: - subject to final due diligence on the development risks, we provide 
the management and wrap for CRRA on the potential fuel cell development   
opportunity that consists of between 25 and 50 MW;
  - any appropriation of funds from the government will require DPUC hearing 
at which we will fully disclose in a factual manner our interest in    FCEL.

I will require that Mark Haedicke manage this process and sign off on all 
press releases, term sheets, disclosure discussions, contracts and regulatory 
filings.  I believe that we have this managed appropriately as long as we 
manage the process as per the script and in a factual manner.

Thanks
Delainey

I just wanted to drop you a short note to let you know that Kevin 
McConville's deposition today in the Berry Construction case went off without 
a hitch.  Outside counsel reports that the deposition was really a 
non-event.  It lasted only three hours, and opposing counsel was not terribly 
effective.  McConville reportedly did an excellent job of sticking to the 
party line, and there were no damning admissions.

		 Subject: 2001 Allocations

Mark, I am not completely sure what the other groups want to do; however, 
assuming a fixed amount of the "internal" legal costs are fairly represented 
by this allocation as ENA's "capacity" charge, you are correct.  This number 
will be in the P/L under your name.  The "outside" legal costs should be 
tracked and controlled and carried at the business unit (by deal) level.   I 
need an estimate of the quarterly "capacity charge" for ENA and an estimate 
of outside legal costs by business unit.

Dave:

I have attached the "time allocations" (which are used for inside costs only) 
by attorney to the various business groups.  We can derive the percentage of 
total legal department inside costs from this chart, in order to calculate 
the capacity charge, for ENA and the other wholesale groups and ENW.  We had 
used this chart to bill back to the various business units within ENA, but we 
will stop doing that now per our conversation.  Are you in agreement?

		 Subject: Draft Organizational Announcement about Japan


May I please have your comments if any on this draft by close of business 
Wednesday.  We hope to have agreed on the Q&A's by then and to send it out 
the announcement on Thursday.

John

To be sent to:  All Enron Europe, all employees in Japan,  all Global Markets 
and all VPs and up around the company

Enron has established several wholesale businesses in Japan in the last year 
including Metals,  Power Plant Development (via our investment in EnCom),  
Coal,  LNG & Weather.   Though Japan continues to make progress towards a 
liberalized electricity market, significant barriers to power trading remain 
under the current interim market structure.  Until further tangible steps are 
taken to improve third party access for electricity in Japan, we will suspend 
our power marketing efforts and focus on the significant opportunities that 
currently exist in our other wholesale businesses.   Once the necessary 
regulatory changes have been completed we expect to aggressively pursue 
Enron's traditional position as the leading buyer and seller of electricity 
in every deregulated market.  

Based on these changes Joe Hirl our President of Enron Japan will move to the 
Global Markets group and lead a team that will focus on developing all our 
Global Markets opportunities in Japan especially Weather,  Oil,  LNG,  Coal, 
and Shipping.    We expect to continue our general recruiting  of Japanese 
nationals and as President of Enron Japan,  Joe will continue to provide the 
overall business leadership to both recruiting and the Analyst and Associate 
program in Japan.  The Finance origination team headed by Jeremy Thirsk will 
continue to report to Joe and also move to Global Markets.  Our power trading 
group led by Morton Erik Pettersen will transition into other roles around 
Enron.  The Equity/FX/Interest rate team which is a part of Global Markets 
has two employees in the Tokyo office today and they expect to expand their 
efforts throughout the year.

The EnCom group, which is our power plant development business (with minority 
partners) and headed by Carey Sloan will continue its efforts in developing 
power plants in Japan.  We are pleased with the progress we are making on a 
number of sites and EnCom will continue to report to the Enron Europe Office 
of the Chairman.

Our Metals team headed by Kazunari Sugimoto will continue to report through 
Enron Metals in London.

By May we expect Enron Credit to have two to three employees in Tokyo pursing 
the Credit Derivative business.  These employees remain in  Enron Credit , a 
part of Enron Europe.

EBS has two employees headed by Jim Weisser and this team expects to expand  
by year end.

The Industrial Markets team also expects to have two employees in the Tokyo 
office in the next couple of months.

In the last seven months the commercial support services for Japan have been 
transitioned to London for support and this is not changing.  Jane McBride 
heads the legal team and will continue to functionally report  to Mark Evans, 
General Counsel in London.   The RAC function will continue to report to Ted 
Murphy, head of RAC for Enron Europe.   The Risk Management and Accounting 
team is headed by Jan-Erland Bekeng will continue to functionally report to 
Fernley Dyson in London.  The  IT, HR,  Tax and real estate teams will also 
continue to functionally report to London. 

Nick O'Day who heads both the Public Affairs group (Government & Regulatory 
Affairs and the Public Relations) in Japan will report to the Enron Europe 
Office of the Chair with a Public Relations functional reporting to Jackie 
Genle in London and a Government Affairs functional reporting to Rick 
Shappiro in Houston.   We anticipate that his team's efforts will be 
primarily directed to supporting the EnCom power plant development team but 
he will also continue to provide support for Global Markets, EBS & Industrial 
Markets.

We have already made considerable progress in breaking into the Japanese 
markets across a wide range of Enron businesses and we anticipate that this 
will be a major profit center for profit growth for years to come. Through 
these current changes we can demonstrate our ability to be flexible and 
target our resources where they will realise the most immediate value for the 
company.

You are a director of Pacific Energy Financing Ltd.  I am in the process of 
converting this Cayman Islands company to a St. Lucia company.  The process 
requires me to obtain a copy of each directors' passport (only the pages with 
the photo and name information).   After obtaining the copies I will prepare 
a statement to attach to the copy and return for each directors' signature.

Please let me know when the copies are available and I will send someone to 
pick them up.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Stacy and Ruth:

I propose the following agenda for the NA energy committee:

1.  convergence of commodity forms -- need to build a team to pursue this
2.  California energy issues/solutions
3.  standardized provisions for master energy contracts -- setoff, netting, 
termination, etc.
4.  bankruptcy 
5.  CFTC study of retail derivatives
6.  emerging market forms for paper, steel, etc.

Mark Taylor will send a list of proposed topics for the European conference.  
Let me know what you think.

Regards,

Hello Mark -- given our e-mail traffic the last couple of days I wanted to
quickly summarize our thoughts on next steps:

1.  Conference call - Mark, Ruth and Stacy re: agenda for NA Energy
Committee
2.  Conference call - Mark, Ruth, Stacy, Christophe, Katia, John re:
coordination of committee activities and agenda for December conference

Depending upon your schedule, we hope to try to get these calls scheduled
either this week or early next week.

Many thanks!  -- Stacy

Subject: European Energy Committee Meeting


Hello Mark -- The European Energy Committee meeting was held in London
today. The attached documents, including the agenda, a memo on the Bridge
agreement, and a copy of the Bridge agreement, were reviewed at this
morning's meeting. 

Much of the discussion focused on explanation of the Bridge Agreement. There
was some discussion about the German regulatory structure and the bridge
agreement.  Katia ran through the agenda in Houston and asked for ideas on
December conference.  I was not able to hear all of the questions entirely
but questions were asked about the outcome of the meeting.  Katia and
Christophe explained that it was a forum to exchange ideas and to promote
use of ISDA within industry. The minutes should give us more detail.  

In addition to a call re: the NA agenda, I think it would be worthwhile to
also have a call w/Christophe, Katia and John Berry to discuss European
activities and to begin discussion on the December agenda. ISDA should begin
to focus on an agenda as soon as possible so that we assure December's
conference is as productive as the Houston conference.  Thanks!

		 Subject: Re: FCEL

With respect to the laundry list Dave D sent you:

1. Press Releases-the press release has not yet been prepared, but a first 
draft was worked up by FCEL's consel. Cle Dade and I are going to look at it 
with respect to what we think it should say, but have not yet done so.

2.Term Sheet -I will send you a draft of the most recent term sheet I am 
aware of by separate email..I believe they are in discussions with FCEL on 
that draft, but nothing has been signed.

3.Disclosure Discussions-I will also send you under separate email the 
initial draft of the "talking points" for the disclosure discusison. It is 
new and has not been discussed internally yet.

4.Contracts-Initial drafts of the documents for the purchase of the equity 
have been drafted and we await comments from FCEL's counsel.  Kay Mann is 
handling the "State" side of the deal and I request Kay by copy of this memo 
to advise you on what the status of any dealings with the state might be.

5.Regulatory Filings-There will be no filings required with respect to the 
purchase of the equity, unless we have to file a Sched. 13D, which will 
depend upon the timing of the option vesting.  My gut reaction is that we 
will probably need to file the 13D, but it is a routine filing.  I do not 
know what will be required in terms of hearings in the state process and 
again request Kay to please advise us on that.

It seems to me thay we should get a little farther along before we meet with 
the team on this, but I defer to your judgment.  Let me know what you want to 
do.

                                                                Dan

I will require that Mark Haedicke manage this process and sign off on all

manage the process as per the script and in a factual manner.

As a follow-up to my earlier e-mail regarding Steve Brownell's experience
regarding municipalization strategies as a way to facilitate Enron's efforts
to be the energy manager for communities, I have attached a proposal
pursuant to which you can potentially use tax-exempt financing to
restructure power contracts.  Let me know if you or anyone else over there
are interested in talking about this further.  I think it's an interesting
idea.

               Mr. Haedicke,

               My name is Shari Fleishman.  I am an attorney with Akin, Gump, 
Strauss, Hauer & Feld, L.L.P. in Washington, D.C., and I was referred to you 
by Charles Moore.  

               Thank you for agreeing to help us arrange interviews with 
Enron employees Fred Lagrasta and Bill Bradford.  To give you some 
background, we are representing Statoil Energy Trading, Inc. in a breach of 
contract dispute with Central Resources, Inc. regarding losses and costs 
resulting from Central's alleged default of its obligations under the terms 
of natural gas and crude oil swap and swaption transactions.  Statoil alleges 
that Central did not provide the credit assurances required once it exceeded 
its credit limit, so Statoil terminated the transactions.  During 
negotiations, however, prior to termination, Central and Statoil were 
negotiating with Enron regarding a possible assignment of the transactions to 
Enron.  This was not consummated, but we would be inquiring into the 
circumstances surrounding the proposed assignment.  We would like to 
interview Enron employees Fred Lagrasta and Bill Bradford regarding these 
discussions concerning the potential assignment, in o!
rder to evaluate whether there is any need to depose either of these 
individuals.  

               Please let me know if you need anything further, and again, I 
appreciate your cooperation in arranging these interviews.  You can call me 
at 202-887-4387, or e-mail me, to discuss arrangements.  Thank you for your 
help.

		 Subject: Proposed Changes Based on California Energy Shortages

Over the past several months, we have reviewed in detail our trading 
contracts and the companies through which we conduct our trading business in 
California.  In order to reduce Enron's non-market risks ( e.g. legal, credit 
and regulatory) in the volatile commodity markets in California or any " 
future California", we propose the following changes:

1.    Mandatory Uniform Set-Off Provisions in All Trading Contracts for All 
Commodities -- set-off language varies commodity by commodity in trading 
contracts.  Set-off is one of the most critical tools available to Enron in a 
major default situation and it is critical to have set-off language and to 
have it be uniform commodity to commodity so that Enron can get the best 
advantage from set-off and not just the least common denominator.

2.     Mandatory Master Netting Agreements For Counterparties With Multiple 
Masters With Significant Opposite Exposures -- where it is necessary to have 
multiple masters with a counterparty, a "bridge" should be put place between 
the masters whenever there is significant opposite exposures under the two or 
more masters.

3.     Merge EPMI into ENA -- power trades are done through EPMI.  Merging 
EPMI into ENA and conducting power trades through ENA is much more efficient 
from both a credit and legal point of view.

4.     No Automatic Termination for a Bankruptcy Event -- 

Let me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts 
or entities through which we conduct our trading.  I believe these changes 
will (i) improve efficiency, (ii) reduce risks, (iii) develop the opportunity 
to do more business with certain counterparties and (iv)substanially improve 
Enron's position in the next California type market.  The long range goal is 
conduct as much as possible of the trading business through a single entity 
and a single or limited number standardized agreements.

Mark, Enron Canada was awarded the contract for managing on behalf of the 
Government of Ontario the Non-Utility Generation Contracts, approx. 2000MW.  
We will be managing the position under an incentive fee arrangement, as well 
as providing back-office operations for sheduling, dispatch, settlement, 
etc.  I understand that commercially this was something we wanted to win 
badly.  Chris did a wonderful job together with our commercial people 
(involving some very late nights) to put together an excellent response to 
the RFP, which was deatiled in identifying and managing the risks.  I 
understand that although our response was to the RFP was therefore 
non-comforming, it showed such a detailed thought and understanding of the 
issues that we were awarded the contract with all of our conditions 
accepted.  Everyone here is very pleased.  We now need to develop the 
definitive agreement with Ontario, which I will help Chris on due to the many 
demands on his time.  At this time I am hoping to try to avoid using external 
counsel.  If we need to use external counsel, I will speak to you regarding 
an appropriate firm.

Peter.

I just heard that Chris Gaffney is transferring to the Toronto office. His 
skill sets/capabilities have been critical in the closing of both the UI and 
NSTAR deals and he has been actively engaged in the long-term NSTAR deal, 
Con-Ed, and our Project Green Jacket. It is critical to our business to have 
no transitional period with attorneys and I expect his replacement to be 
fully up to speed (i.e. knowledge of the power market, understanding of 
structured power transactions, etc) relative to definitive documents around 
these transactions. Chris is definitely a loss to our team. Please advise as 
to his qualified replacement on these specific deals.  Thanks.

Mark,

As a practical matter, I believe that it will be difficult to maintain an 
updated inventory of confidential information on an ongoing basis.  That 
conceivably could be someone's full-time job, given the vast amount of 
confidential and proprietary projects at issue just within EWS.  

I do agree that we need to put some protocols in place with regard to how 
Enron handles different levels of confidential information (including trade 
secrets).  Rather than have an ongoing commission guided by outside counsel, 
I would suggest that Pete, Scott Tholan, the IT security team, internal 
corporate security, as well as legal subject matter experts get together to 
put forth guidelines on how information should be retained and protected.  
Those guidelines would describe the type of information at issue and the 
corresponding security measures to put in place to protect that material.  
For example, trading positions and curves would have one standard for access 
and disclosure, while personnel information would have a different one.  The 
benefit to this approach is that we can set the guidelines and manage on a 
periodic basis to make sure that they are followed, rather than create 
updated inventories.  

It also presumably would save on outside counsel fees.  I would not view this 
type of approach as requiring much, if any, assistance from outside counsel.

Let me know your thoughts.

Michelle

  Pete Van De Gohm of EES has again raised the topic of inventorying our 
trade secret protection which has been discussed from time to time.  I have 
visited with Jim Derrick about having a legal/business committee representing 
your major groups.  It would function in a similar manner as our Y2K 
committee did.  We would have Fulbright & Jaworski give our people general 
instructions, our business people would canvass our companies to determine 
what we considered proprietary trade secrets and if we were not protecting 
our proprietary information appropriately, we could address that issue.  
Fulbright could also be used on an ad hoc basis.   Costs would be shared 
proportionately between the major groups except special fees attributable to 
a specific operating group.
 
  I believe we need this inventory.  If we try to enforce our non-competition 
agreements and we can't prove that we kept such information on a need to know 
basis and properly secured, we could lose the law suit.  

  Jim asked that I contact each of you regarding this to see if you were in 
agreement with the proposed plan.  Please respond as soon as possible if you 
agree so we can get the project off the ground.

I do not think so.  I think he will be at Enron until he is 65.   Mark

I think it really depends on what sort of topics they are thinking of having.
Also BTW, do you think Ken Lay is going to resign?  Everyone here seems 
pretty sure he will (so does the Japanese media).  I have heard his responses 
to this question before so I know what the official line is.

It sounds premature at this time for ISDA to put on an energy seminar in 
Japan.  Do you agree?   Mark

Enron Japan is also planning an energy conference in April / May of next year 
to promote our energy business here in Japan.  The arrangements are still 
very much at the preliminary stage so are confidential which is why I did not 
copy this email to the ISDA person.  (As you would suspect we are still some 
way off being able to use ISDA documentation for any of our energy 
transactions, which are tending to be physical transactions.)

Jane:

ISDA is planning an energy seminar in Tokyo in mid-May.  We have heard there 
may be an energy seminar in March or April in Tokyo.  Have you heard of the 
earlier seminar?  We are trying to decide whether it makes sense to go 
forward on the May seminar.  Could you look into this and talk to the traders.

Thanks for your help.

Regards,

Mark

Randy/Sandeep:

I'm attaching a first stab at an org chart for the Enron Global Assets legal 
group.  Mark Haedicke's preliminary thought is that all international region 
attorneys will initially be put in Global Assets.  Over time, we can review 
this allocation.

I understand that some international lawyers are currently doing EBS and EES 
type work.  However, unless Vicky Sharp or Kristina Mordaunt has these 
lawyers on their respective headcounts, we need to get them included in Enron 
Wholesale.

I'm sure that the chart is not yet accurate.  I'm out of the office today and 
we did not have time to track down each lawyer's current title.  I would 
appreciate your help in this regard.  All other comments are welcome as 
well.  

Thanks for your assistance.

Bruce

 In order to provide better oversight and control of ENA legal expenditures 
on large transactions, please continue to follow the procedures set forth 
below for transactions where outside legal fees and expenses are expected to 
exceed $25,000.00.  The purpose of these procedures is to (i) improve 
communication with counsel (inside and outside) on issues, fees and services 
and (ii) send price signals on legal costs (with respect to specific 
transactions) on a timely basis to the business units.  Every effort should 
be made to continue to provide high quality legal work that has become 
standard at ENA.

 1.  A written estimate of proposed fees and expenses and a written 
description of the services shall be provided by our outside counsel.  The 
responsible business unit and the General Counsel shall review and approve 
such written estimate before our outside counsel is directed to provide 
substantial professional services.

 2.  Our outside counsel shall be instructed to promptly submit a revised 
written estimate if such outside counsel determines that legal fees and 
expenses for such transaction will exceed the previous written estimate by 
$25,000.00.  Such revised written estimate shall be reviewed and approved by 
the responsible business unit and the General Counsel or his/her designee 
before our outside counsel is directed to provide substantial additional 
professional services. 

 3.  In order to accurately track such expenses so that the expenses can be 
properly allocated to the various business units, a work order number should 
be obtained for each transaction.  

 Thank you for your cooperation.  If you have any questions or any other 
suggestions for controlling expenses, please call me at extension 36544.

   Mark

 Bob, Mary and I have been discussing a variety of issues and need
your input before sending out the invitation, which we should do soon.
Please advise on the following:

   1.  We continue to feel the name of the committee
(including Power) is not sufficiently expansive to accommodate the growing
markets involving energy and other new derivatives. We were considering
something like Energy and Developing Derivative Markets?  We thought the old
name Commodities had a traditional rather than a forward-looking sound to
it. What are your thoughts?  I like Energy/Emerging Markets Committee or 
Energy and Emerging Markets Committee.

   2.  As we discussed a couple of weeks ago, invites
should go to US companies and non-US companies with a US presence in the
energy/commodity markets. Non-members should be invited as in London. We
told people at the London meeting about the Houston meeting so they are on
notice. Also, if there are minutes of that meeting produced soon they will
probably refer to the meeting so there may be no need to invite them.
Individual call-ins should be discouraged, but we might consider giving
people an opportunity to gather at ISDA NY and plug a small group in from
there. It's unlikely we will get many people from NY to go to Houston just
for this meeting.  I am ok with plugging people in from NYC so long as we 
know exactly who we are plugging in.

   3.  When you suggested Enron as the venue, were you
offering a conference room or should we be considering the Doubletree or
somewhere else?  .  Did we ever settle hours, etc. and whether there should
be some kind of "social event" afterwards and for whom?  All of this is
obviously intended to increase the profile/activity of the committee;
highlight the upcoming conference; focus on the issues that are not as
significant to the European committee. Should we agree to a general social
event, we'll include in the attached draft invitation.  I am ok having a 
social event, but wonder if we shouldn't see how this meeting goes and plan 
next time accordingly.  Please schedule a room at the Doubletree.  I would 
suggest 3:30 and plan on a two hours meeting.

   4. Attached is a draft invitation. Please
comment on the text, etc.   Would you prefer to be the signatory? No
    <<Energy Agenda Draft.doc>>

   I look forward to your thoughts.
   Many thanks, Ruth

Mark -

Attached is the EGA Legal report for February.  I'm interested in your 
feedback on level of detail.  Some of our contributors gave quite a bit of 
detail (e.g., India) while others were quite a bit more brief (although 
generally on less important projects).

Also, I've left out discussion of the South America assets.  I'm assuming 
that is coming from John/Randy -- I know that Miguel Mendoza is inputting to 
them on most of these assets.

Thanks,
Bruce

I understand from the Corporate Secretary that AER*X Inc. was a subsidiary of 
Enron Power Services.  AER*X Inc. has been dissolved according to the 
Corporate Secretary in 1994.  This company owned the mark AER*XTERT which 
subsequently was assigned to Enron Power Services.  As I said in my previous 
message, the mark is up for renewal.  Are we using the mark and if not, there 
would be no basis to renew it.  Can you please help me?

Thanks.

		 Subject: Electronic Delivery of ISDA Documentation

ISDA will soon be in a position to make its documentation available
electronically. I know that many of you have been advocating this for awhile
so I am happy to say that the day will soon be here. In anticipation of
that, I would appreciate your input on how the documentation is made
available and, in particular, the pricing of that access.
 
For anyone other than an ISDA member, the documents will be made available
in electronic PDF form for purchase on a per document basis. For members,
two additional options will be made available for access to interactive
versions of the documentation: an internet version and an intranet version.
 
The internet version will consist of the complete library of ISDA
documentation in an interactive version also in PDF format. The documents
will include internal links within documents (section reference to the
section itself, use of a defined term to its definition) as well as links to
User's Guides that have been published for a particular document. We propose
that the pricing of this option will be on a per user annual fee basis.
 
The intranet option will permit users to take the full library of ISDA
documents and place it on a firm's intranet, thereby providing access to
anyone within the firm who has access to the intranet. ISDA would charge a
fixed annual fee for this service. 
 
I would appreciate your responses to the following questions:
 
1. Ignoring cost, do you think your institution would be more likely to use
the internet version of the documents or take them onto your intranet? 
 
2. If you are more likely to use the internet version, how many users would
you anticipate worldwide within your institution?
 
3. For the internet service, would you prefer to pay (a) a high initial fee
for the first user (e.g., $5,000) and a small additional fee for each
incremental user (e.g., $100) or (b) a lower initial fee (e.g., $3,000) and
a larger additional fee for each incremental user (e.g., $500)? Assume for
these purposes that the cost of the intranet service is $10,000 per annum.
 
4. Would your answer to question 3 change if the cost of the intranet
service were $15,000?
 
I will not hold you to any of these answers. I just hope to get your input
as we proceed to further consideration at the Board level of how electronic
delivery of documentation will work and how it will be priced.
 
Thank you for your input.
 
Bob Pickel

Dear Mark,

Thank you for your suggested topics.  I will forward your e-mail on to Susan
Hinko as I understand she will be working on this panel with you.  I would
be happy to arrange a conference call for sometime next week.  Please advise
on who should participate on the call and I can issue an e-mail requesting
the participants availability.

Until we have the conference call, I will amend the agenda to include your
suggested topics below.  Once we determine who should participate on the
call, I will circulate the agenda to all conference call participants.  I
agree that it will be a good time to have an Energy Derivatives panel in
Europe during the AGM as I understand there has been a lot of activity in
this market in Europe.

By the way, I understand that Sylvia contacted our office regarding the
dates for Strategic Planning in 2000.  Strategic Planning is scheduled for
Wednesday, June 7 through Friday, June 9 at the Sonoma Mission Inn & Spa in
Sonoma, California.  Please mark your calendar.  The Board Meeting during
the AGM will be held on Wednesday, March 15 and Thursday, March 16 during
lunch on each day.

Please let me know about scheduling a conference call by Friday, December
10.

I look forward to hearing from you and best regards,
Alison Smythe

Alison:

I think the energy panel at the AGM on March 17, 2000 in Amsterdam should
discuss (i) development of energy trading on the continent, (ii) energy
documentation issues and (iii) regulatory barriers to energy trading.  This
is a great time to do a panel on energy trading in Europe!  I will copy Paul
and Justin in London to get their ideas on both topics and panel members.
Perhaps we can have a conference call next week.

I am ok with it so long as you don't spend much time at it.  If there is a 
material time commitment or the company is competing head to head with Enron, 
then it would be a problem.  Mark

Mark - back in June you and I had a brief discussion re: the topic below.  
Nexus has now extended a formal invitation for me to join their board so 
complying with the Code of Ethics I sent the e-mail below to Sharon Butcher 
this morning.  She responded by asking if I'd discussed this with you and I 
relayed the essence of our brief conversation and forwarded to her the first 
e-mail I'd sent to you.  Call if you have any questions.  x33212.

Subject: Code of Ethics - Notice of Potential Conflict of Interest

Sharon - eight years ago before coming to work for Enron, I was a partner in 
a cogen development company which we sold in 1993.  It was through that 
company that I developed a relationship with Enron and subsequently came to 
work here in 1993.  

Since coming to Enron, I have maintained regular contact and networks with 
several of my former partners.  One of them, Barry Curtiss-Lusher, started up 
his own oil and gas exploration and production company, Nexus Resources, in 
Denver.  Barry has recently asked me to join his Board of Directors.  
Reviewing the Enron Code of Ethics (specifically, page 57, July 2000 edition) 
I wanted to provide the following information:

Nexus Resources, 650 S. Cherry St., Suite 420, Denver, CO  80246
Barry Curtiss-Lusher, President/CEO
privately owned
principle business is oil and gas exploration and production in various 
basins throughout the U.S., primarily in Louisiana, Kansas and the Rocky 
Mountain states

My role as a Board member would be similar to any other Board role with 
regular meetings on a quarterly basis (teleconferencing is permitted under 
Nexus' bylaws) with all expenses, if any, paid by Nexus.  Currently, Nexus 
does not pay any cash stipend to its Directors.  It does, however, compensate 
Board members with Nexus stock.  Additionally, I would be making a minor 
personal investment in Nexus stock.

Pursuant to the Enron Code of Ethics, I would/will NOT be performing any 
managerial, professional or other duties which would interfere with my own 
specific job performance at Enron.  Nor is Nexus currently involved in any 
business which competes, directly or indirectly, with that of Enron Corp. or 
any of its subsidiaries.

Although I have been nominated and approved by the current Board of Directors 
of Nexus Resources, I have NOT yet accepted the position pending resolution 
and approval by Enron Management pursuant to the Code of Ethics.  Please let 
me know if you have any questions regarding the information above and/or what 
other steps need to be taken.

		 Subject: FOR IMMEDIATE REVIEW: Agreement Restricting Power Generation 
Competition in Asia Pacific Region

General Counsels -

At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman, I am sending 
this e-mail to you pursuant to the Enron Corp. Policy on Noncompetition.  I 
would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail 
and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns.  
Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron 
affiliates) by Monday, October 2.

Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia 
Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction 
with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation 
portfolios into a single company (Newco).  Newco would be charged with making 
the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the 
shareholders' respective stakes in Newco.  

The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a 
"dumping ground" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle 
through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation 
opportunities in Asia.  As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include 
competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that 
would bind their respective affiliates.  

The following is a summary of these competition provisions:

Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own 
power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first 
offering the opportunity to Newco.  If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron 
would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties 
provided that the terms do not materially improve.  Development or ownership 
does not include the provision of construction, O&M, offtaker or risk 
management services.

There are a number of exceptions to this rule:  (a) small projects involving 
20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; (c) 
projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural 
gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in 
which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and 
(f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary 
liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition 
restriction.

"Affiliates" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are 
publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix).

"Asia Pacific Region" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including 
Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, 
Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East 
Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, 
Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii).  
It does not include Japan and Australia.

The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling 
its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 2003.

Thank you,
Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel, Enron APACHI

My accomplishments for the year 2000 include the following:

1.    EEI Form Master Power Contract -- ENA Legal led the industry 
development of the first master power contract.  The form is rapidly becoming 
the industry standard for North America and in the process dramatically 
lowering costs and increasing liquidity.  In October, we put an EEI into 
place with PG&E with the result that Enron credit exposure is $50,000,000 
less than under the prior contract.

2.    New Legal Risk Rating Methodology -- implemented a legal rating system 
which simplifies the review of legal risks and makes it much easier to 
determine whether or not we are being appropriately compensated for the legal 
risks.

3.    EWS Legal Website for Training -- website has gone live for training 
regarding all major EWS legal issues.  This website will reduce training 
costs and increase availability of training to all employees.  

4.    Developing New Businesses -- integral part of developing and 
structuring Enron Online, bandwidth trading, equity trading, Clickpaper.com, 
insurance, pulp, coal, Japan and Australia.

5.     Litigation Settlements -- many disputes were settled favorably 
including Fort James, California Px, TVA and BPA.

6.    Deal Machine Never Stops -- projects having lots of complex legal 
issues cutting across multiple disciplines including MG Metals, Las Vegas 
Cogen II, Pastoria, sale of the Peakers, sale of HPL, Electrobolt, JV with 
Texaco (Bridgeline), posting agreements for Enron Online, East Coast Power, 
QF restructurings like Motown, Project Summer (sale of international assets) 
and on and on. 

7.    Deregulation of Energy Trading -- ENA legal formed an energy coalition 
and worked through ISDA and our Washington office to pass legislation to 
significantly reduce CFTC oversight of ENA's trading business.  

8.    Management -- built a deal-oriented team that understands the 
underlying businesses and is working to share the legal technology across 
Enron.

Good morning.  

Do you have some time today or tomorrow to go over a few last details about 
the job?  I have questions about (1) post-remodeling office location, (2) 
payment of professional dues, CLE expenses, and (3) vacation for this year.

Thanks,

Let's do it in August during the week of the seventh.  Please start working 
on a short memo for Dave and me to send out.  I think we need to have at 
least two dates.  The memo should say attendance is mandatory.

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.  
Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late 
June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to 
go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success. 

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. 
climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  
The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your 
schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, 
Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.    

Regards

John

Mr. Fournier:

This is Janette Elbertson, Mark Haedicke's Assistant.  I spoke with your 
assistant this morning and this meeting has been rescheduled for Thursday,  
March 1, at 11:30 am in Jim Derrick's office.  Lunch is scheduled after the 
meeting if that meets your schedule.

Mark Haedicke is traveling this week.  I will call your e-mail to his 
attention upon his return on Friday.

Dear Mark: 
 
I trust you had a pleasant holiday season.  I understand that our meeting 
with Jim Derrick and you has been rescheduled to the first part of March.  
Your assistant gave us the choice of March 1 or 2.  Although we can 
accommodate both dates, March 1 works better for David Jackson. 
 
Our understanding is that Blakes is not getting any further work from Enron 
as a result of the circumstances under which we could no longer continue 
acting for Enron in litigation involving Westcoast, another Blakes client. 
 
As you can well imagine, the prospect of losing our valued relationship with 
Enron is extremely disappointing, especially considering the significant 
inroads we had made during the last couple of years in getting to know Enron, 
its various businesses and representing your interests on a number of major 
transactions and initiatives in Canada. 
 
At this point in time, we need to better understand where we stand and 
whether there is any prospect of representing your interests in Canada.  One 
of our concerns in trying to mend fences is our relationship with your 
Calgary office which we perceive to be paramount in any effort to 
re-establish the kind of relationship we had with Enron prior to this 
incident.  As a result, we would like to seek your views on this prior to our 
meeting in Houston so as not to further aggravate our relationship with the 
Calgary office.
 
David Jackson and Jim Christie, two key members of our senior executive, and 
I would be available to discuss this matter with you at your convenience 
Wednesday, Thursday or Friday of next week.  Perhaps you can let me know what 
works best for you and we could initiate the call. 
 
Thanking you in advance for your kind consideration. 
 
Best regards, 
 
Dan

The purpose of this memo is to share with you the new We are pleased to

realignment of the principal Enron Wholesale Services business units

Lundstrom, General Counsel of EGA, to coordinate legal support with respect 
to the EGA businesses in the region.  An organizational chart describing the 
new structure is attached.

We believe This new structure will enable us to continue to provide quality 
legal support across business lines within South America while improving 
coordination and providing additional support from Houston for Enron's 
existing operating businesses, as well as the new business development 
initiatives under way in the region.

		 Subject: Organizational Announcement

Mark, Bruce and Randy:  Below is a draft reorg memo and an updated org chart 
for your review and comment.  The org chart is a bit dense so any suggestions 
on how to clean it up would be welcome.  Thanks.

Rgds,
 John


The purpose of this memo is to share with you the new organizational changes 
that have been implemented in the Enron South America legal department in 
response to the recent reorganization and realignment of the principal Enron 
Wholesale Services business units operating in the region, Enron Americas and 
Enron Global Assets. 

Randy Young, currently general counsel of ESA, will be assuming new 
responsibilities within Enron. Replacing him will be John Novak, who will 
become general counsel of ESA, reporting to Mark Haedicke.  The ESA legal 
department will be responsible for supporting all Enron Americas and Enron 
Global Assets businesses in the region.  Additional legal resources, 
coordinated by Lance Schuler, will be provided from EWS - Legal in Houston to 
support ESA's wholesale activities.  John will also work closely with Bruce 
Lundstrom, general counsel of EGA, to coordinate legal support with respect 
to the EGA businesses in the region.  An organizational chart describing the 
new structure is attached.

We believe this new structure will enable us to continue to provide quality 
legal support across business lines within South America while improving 
coordination and providing additional support from Houston for Enron's 
existing operating businesses as well as the new business development 
initiatives under way in the region.

Subject: Blurb from EEI Report



Mark:

I thought you would find the attached blurb describing an effort in the UK to 
attempt to indirectly curb prices for generation of some interest in light of 
ENA's enhanced interest in building and owning peaker plants and the desire 
to capture profits particularly during times of electric market volatility 
(even though ENA's plants, unlike those of PowerGen and National Power, will 
constitute only a very small percentage of the generation market).  While I 
do not see this type of policy occurring in the U.S. I always think it is 
useful to keep an eye on developments like this, even if they exist outside 
the U.S., since many U.S regulators often look to the UK for "ideas" since it 
is further ahead in some respects on the deregulation curve.

John



*    U.K.:  REGULATOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO SUE
      An offshoot of Dallas-based TXU, Edison Mission Energy and
 AES Corp. are three energy companies likely to be most affected
 by U.K. industry regulator Callum McCarthy's announcement
 yesterday that customers could be able to sue their suppliers
 for abusively raising prices.
      The measure is designed to safeguard potential price
 manipulation by generators until new electricity wholesale
 trading rules are introduced next year. McCarthy plans to add
 "good behavior" clauses to legislation proposed by the
 government last week and scheduled for discussion in parliament
 next month. And an independent advisory body would settle
 disputes between McCarthy and electric companies.
      Allegations from big industry customers that National Power
 and PowerGen abused their market power by raising prices in July
 spurred McCarthy's action. The company's combined profits were
 $21.7 million higher than profits during the same two weeks in
 1998.  The companies "strenuously deny" the charges of price
 manipulation (Andrew Taylor, Financial Times, Oct. 19).

Mark,

In a week or so Enron Global Exploration & Production will make a pitch to 
Korea National Oil Corporation amounting to a comprehensive proposal to 
provide various oil- and gas-field services to KNOC, plus offer the 
opportunity to provide financing, risk management and other Enron-type 
things.  (Our dealings with KNOC are so far highly confidential.)

Cedric Burgher, the CFO of Enron Global E&P, has, in the message below, 
sought my help with language to make the financing pitch as strong as 
possible but at the same time not binding on Enron.

Can you look at this and offer any comments or suggestions, or have someone 
in the legal group of ENA respond?  I would really appreciate it.

Thanks.
Stephen Wallace.

Subject: KNOC Finance Language

Stephen,

As we discussed, it would be helpful to contact an attorney in ENA to lift 
"invester banker" like language to insert in our initial term sheet for 
KNOC.  The following is an approximation of what I have in mind.

"If desired by KNOC and subject to prevailing market conditions, Enron will 
use its best efforts to structure, advise, arrange, underwrite, syndicate, 
and/or provide the capital necessary to complete the project."

I'm sure the ENA guys have better language than this from some of their pitch 
books, but hopefully you see what I'm looking for with my first cut.  From a 
marketing perspective, we would like this to be as strong and attractive as 
possible from a KNOC perspective, and still provide us outs to make the 
"offer" non-binding.

Cedric

Mark, while I'm sure you're buried by the California situation, I'd like to 
get together with you when you get a chance to discuss business 
opportunities.  Despite consistently high marks for quality of work, 
responsiveness and cost-effectiveness (and despite getting feedback from 
several sources that we're the preferred firm on any deal that politically 
can be sent to someone other than V&E), we seem to be getting less business 
over the last 3-4 months than we're used to getting.  I just want to make 
sure there's not any negative issues, and assuming there are none, see what 
we can do to get more business from Enron.

Whereas in the California phase of the western power crisis, we had to deal 
with the emergence of a new governmental agency, CDWR, and figure out whether 
or not and how it might pay us,  in the next, northwest phase, where we will 
probably have to deal with the disintegration, or at least misbehavior,  of a 
powerful federal rogue agency, BPA, one issue that will invariably arise is 
payment default by BPA.  As we have blithely sailed along with BPA up until 
now, we often say to ourselves,  "Oh, when you contract with BPA, you are 
backed by the good faith and credit of the United States of America."  I 
would like you both to put your heads together and decide who at your firm 
can give us a memo addressing BPA's payment mechanisms from a legal, 
statutory perspective.  It bothers me to hear things like;  "they only have 
$700 million in their warchest,"  or "if they can't make their Treasury 
payment they are toast."  What do these kinds of remarks mean to us legally?  
Are we contracting with the surplus bloated   Treasury of the United States 
of America or are we going to have a rude surprise and find out that we are 
contracting with one of these discrete funds that can run out of cash and be 
held hostage by warring politicians?   We need a concise legal analysis of 
this point very soon. ----cgy

Steve:

Attached is a series of press releases by MG Plc regarding their metals 
website, the first of which was launched on or about October 4, 1999.

I also have a message in to the attorneys at Enron that worked closely on the 
acquisition, but one of our commercial people understands the site to be an 
on-line brokerage system (like E*Trade) -- the press release on the launch of 
the system (at the bottom of this message) indicates that the site is an LME 
trading and execution system.  I'll forward over any other information I can 
find.     




USA: Metal exchanges hold firm as Web trading blooms.

06/22/2000
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2000. 

NEW YORK, June 22 (Reuters) - The world's two largest metal exchanges said 
they will retain their roles despite the rapid expansion in Internet trading 
and as another major metal dealer announced the launch of an online trading 
system on Thursday. 
The London Metal Exchange (LME) is carefully planning its introduction of 
electronic trading in the second-half of this year and refuses to be 
"spooked" by those "urging action, any action, as long as it is now," 
Jonathan Haslam, LME director of corporate affairs, told a conference in New 
York.
His comments were echoed by Patrick Thompson, president of the New York 
Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), who said it would be very difficult for the new 
online trading systems to bring together those elements that underpinned the 
success of the traditional exchanges. 
Thompson told the Metal Bulletin E-Commerce 2000 conference that said these 
elements included the handling of counterparty credit risk, the clearing of 
trades and the existing pools of liquidity provided by the different segments 
of the metals market which use the exchanges. 
Haslam compared the LME's trading turnover averaging $8 billion a day with 
the around $1.5 billion a day traded online by U.S. energy giant Enron Corp. 
. 
Enron's expansion in the e-commerce market was earlier referred to by Thomas 
Pimpinelli, senior vice president of MG London Inc. part of U.K.-based metals 
trading group MG Plc . In May, MG agreed to a 300 pence per share cash offer 
from Enron. 
Pimpinelli said MG's own MITS online metals trading system, launched in 
October 1999, has to date processed over 135,000 contracts with an overall 
value of $5.25 billion. 
He told the meeting that between 65 percent to 80 percent of MG's order flow, 
mostly from small metals clients, was now done over the Internet. 
Pimpinelli said the success of its "Market Maker" real-time trading facility 
within MITS for tonnages of up to a 1,000 tonnes, had encouraged the company 
to create a new product for the Managed Futures industry called "CTA Trader." 
The product will differ from Market Maker in that the customer can trade 
larger volumes, request a volume quote on-line, and then have the facility to 
book the resulting live on-line quote. 
"Once executed the customers will need to breakdown or allocate the 
transaction to his individual or multiple pre-approved clearing houses by way 
of a dropdown menu," he said. Pimpinelli added that CTA Trader would be 
launched in the next month or so. 
Sharing a platform with Pimpinelli, Karl Hackert, head of e-commerce at U.S. 
trader Koch Metals, announced the impending launch of his company's own 
online metals trading system by the end of June. Koch metals is a unit of 
Koch Industries Inc. . 
Hackert said the issue of the LME's daily forward prices valuation at 5.30 
p.m. in London, meant that the level of these quotes wasn't clear during the 
rest of the trading day. Under the new Koch system prices will be updated 
every five seconds and out to 27 months. 
"Koch are the first to do this (offer near real-time forward prices) and it 
is a big step forward in terms of market transparency," he said. 
Hackert said Koch had built its system to better communicate with its clients 
and it did not intend to go into direct competition with the LME. 
"Making a generic mass system? I don't think that's the business we're in," 
he said.

UK: UPDATE 2-MG to widen access to online metals trade.
By Andy Blamey

06/13/2000
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2000. 

LONDON, June 13 (Reuters) - U.K.-based metals trading group MG plc said on 
Tuesday it would broaden access to its online metals trading systems as the 
battle for web pre-eminence comes to the boil. 
MG, one of the world's leading metals traders, said it would allow London 
Metal Exchance clearing members to use the system, which had been restricted 
to clients, with immediate effect.
The move comes in response to strong demand for access to the system, an MG 
spokesman said. MG has so far signed up 14 Category One (ring dealing) and 
Category Two (associate broker clearing) members of the LME. 
"We have decided to broaden the availability of Market Maker following the 
rapid increase in volumes and substantial uptake by both existing and new 
clients," said Michael Hutchinson, CEO of MG's Financial Services Division in 
a statement. 
"We are confident that we have an online product which will meet demand from 
other clearing members of the LME." 
The wider access to MG's system need not necessarily pose a threat to other 
online marketplaces, said Gavin Gross, head of LME metals at brokerage 
Spectron Futures Ltd. Spectron plans to launch online systems to trade London 
Metal Exchange contracts later this month. 
"They're very different models. MG is a principal in the market, so you're 
looking at MG prices only. Spectron is neutral, we're just providing a 
platform. It's a multilateral system with lots of dealers interacting with 
each other," Gross said. 
"The two can exist side by side," he added. 
Over 80 percent of MG's clients are now using its online services, the 
company said. Market Maker turnover stood at 3,000 contracts in May - a 
growth rate of approximately 50 percent per month since the launch in January 
of this year. 
Online deals still make up a low proportion of MG's total trading turnover, 
however. 
MG's MITS system launched in October 1999 and has now processed over 95,000 
contracts with a dollar value in excess of $3.8 billion and a monthly 
turnover in excess of $1 billion. 
"We are using it (MITS) for the one or two lot small stop orders that you 
previously missed and had the customer ringing up asking if we had done his 
trade," said one user of an MG system at an ABCM. 
However, it would appear that MG is now limiting the size of the orders it 
will accept on MITS from its non-customers, he said. 
Metals e-commerce sites are proliferating, but they follow no single business 
model. There are portals run by single principals quoting their own prices; 
intranets where big market players are cooperating; different rules for 
access; and a wide variation in revenue models, the key to profitability. 
The company announced in March it had joined Internet Capital Group and 
Safeguard International Fund to form the EMETRA joint venture, in which MG 
has a 25 percent stake. 
EMETRA is building a worldwide business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce 
marketplace for the non-ferrous metals markets, including physical trading a 
futures and options contracts. 
MG contributed its Internet systems to EMETRA and continues to use MITS and 
Market Maker under a licence agreement with EMETRA. 
In May, MG agreed a 300 pence per share cash offer from U.S. energy and 
communications group Enron, a major player in the e-commerce market through 
Enron Online, which trades around 840 products in some 13 countries in 11 
currencies.

US Enron Bid For MG May Signal End Of LME Outcry Trading
By Adam Aljewicz

05/23/2000
Dow Jones International News 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Enron's (ENE) offer to buy London Metal Exchange ring 
dealing firm MG PLC (U.MGA) could bring the exchange one step closer to 
ending open outcry trading, dealers say. 
Both the U.S.-based energy and communications group, and MG have pioneered 
electronic trading and are widely seen as being among the only participants 
on the LME trading floor capable of making the transition to on-screen 
trading. The LME, meanwhile, is also seeking to introduce on-screen 
technology for out-of-ring trading sessions.
"We're not surprised in the least to see this tie-up take place," an analyst 
at Deutsche Bank told Dow Jones Newswires. "Everything we see now is pointing 
toward the removal of the ring-dealing sessions, and it's just a matter of 
time before it ends all together," she said. 
MG's chairman Tom McKeever said the company won't abandon its position as an 
LME ring dealing member, but market watchers doubt whether - after 123 years 
- open outcry can survive on the LME as fast-paced technological change 
sweeps through the industry. 
Enron has made a GBP300 million cash offer for London-based MG in a bid to 
gain a foothold in the $120 billion-a-year world metal market. The U.S. 
company already has a substantial market share in natural gas and electricity 
markets, and with its electronic trading platform, Enron On Line, it has 
already executed more than 110,000 transactions valued at over $45 billion 
since its launch in November. 
"It's not surprising to see a strategic link up between an energy and metals 
company because they're both very big in industrial commodities," said an 
analyst for a U.S.-based commission house. "I think it's almost inevitable 
that open outcry trading will be a thing of the past," he said. 
Enron's move into the metals market has also been linked to the LME's growing 
interest in initiating an automated trading system, and has lead some market 
watchers to suggest that the Enron-MG tie-up will lead to greater 
consolidation among LME members. 
Metals trading companies and brokerage firms are struggling to survive as 
profits wane amid the growth of banks and funds in the metals trading arena. 
"Out of the 13 ring dealing firms on the LME, I think only six will be able 
to make the transition to on-screen trading," said a dealer for a 
London-based bank. "And that's only because we have a banking background," he 
said. 
The six cited are MG, the metals trading arm of the Bank of Nova Scotia, 
U.S.-based brokerage Refco Inc., Credit Lyonnais Rouse, Barclays Capital and 
Fimat Metals. 
The LME's existing system involves the trading of eight metals within its 
circular trading floor. Around 35% of the LME's trading takes place there, 
but this figure could drop if the LME decides to abandon open outcry, traders 
say. "Market participants will have to decide whether to use the ring 
or go through the Internet," said a dealer. "That's how it will start
and will probably lead to the trading floor being bypassed
altogether." 

MG, which was spun off from Germany's Metallgesellschaft last September, has 
pioneered the use of metals trading on the Internet with the launch in 
October of MITS and MARKET MAKER, its Internet trading system. 
MG is the second-largest physical merchant of copper, nickel and aluminum in 
Europe after Switzerland's Glencore. 
"When profit margins are narrowing and so many LME companies are looking more 
and more uncertain about their future, MG (is) arguably the pick of the crop 
in terms of stability and profitably," said a dealer for a North 
American-owned ring dealing firm. LME Considers Screen Trading 

Separately, the LME has considered a series of moves that would also hasten 
the demise of open outcry trading. 
It has repeatedly said it is looking to develop an electronic screen-trading 
system for use in out of ring trading sessions, and that it plans to press 
ahead with changes to its ownership structure by demutualizing in favor of 
becoming a shareholder entity. 
"We've made very clear that there are proposals for consequential changes to 
the LME's governance," said Jonathan Haslam, director of corporate affairs at 
the LME. 
The LME set up an eight-member committee in February which comprised four 
ring dealing members and four associate broker members to map out a strategy 
for the implementation of new technology. 
However, it has so far declined to comment on how this technology will be 
executed, although Haslam has said the LME is looking at around 20 companies 
with the requisite knowledge and background to provide and implement the 
on-screen technology. 
"We said we would look into setting up an interoffice screen trading system 
but we have yet to come to a decision on who our technical partner will be," 
he said. "But we should come to a decision in a couple of weeks."

MG exceeds $1B Internet trade target

Post Company). All rights reserved. 

LONDON - International metals trader MG PLC said yesterday that business on 
its six-month old Internet trading systems had comfortably exceeded its 
transaction value target of $1-billion (all figures in U.S. dollars). 
"We are at $1.5-billion as of this morning. We are are very pleased with the 
progress and the rate of growth," said Tom McKeever, MG chairman.
He noted that online trading in metals is seen growing rapidly, according to 
a recent study by Anderson Consulting. Just 2% to 3% of business in the 
non-ferrous industry is currently conducted online, while in three to five 
years it will be 40% to 60%, he said. 
Since the launch in October, volumes on MG's internet systems, known as MITS 
and MARKET MAKER, have increased by 50% a month and cumulatively exceed 
30,000 contracts now. 
MG said it had also gained customers as its systems are the only ones that 
currently offer online trading. "When we launched the system, we had requests 
from many new customers to register. We registered quite a few new customers. 
It is beyond our expectations," Mr. McKeever added. 
The increase in on-line business on MITS has been seen round the clock as 
customers have become increasingly comfortable with the system. 
"We were the first to start the system. It has been late coming to the metals 
business, but we think it is good for the industry," he said. 
Last month, MG announced it had joined Internet Capital Group and Safeguard 
International Fund to form an eMetra joint venture in which it has a 25% 
stake.

MG INTERNET TRADING UPDATE 
MG announces that in the first six months of trading on its Internet systems, 
MITS and MARKET MAKER, it has surpassed its target of US $1 billion in value 
of transactions. The volume of transactions has been increasing by 50% a 
month since October and cumulatively exceeds 30,000 contracts.
The trading systems have attracted new customers as well as MG's existing 
customers because it is the only system currently available that offers them 
an on-line LME trading and execution service. 
The launch of MITS was announced in October 1999 by MG. In February, MG 
announced that it had joined with Internet Capital Group and Safeguard 
International Fund to form the eMetra joint venture, in which MG has a 25% 
stake. eMetra is in the process of establishing a worldwide 
business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce marketplace for the non-ferrous metals 
markets, including physical trading and the trading of futures and options 
contracts. MG contributed its Internet systems to eMetra and continues to use 
MITS and MARKET MAKER under a licence agreement with eMetra. Once eMetra is 
fully operational later this year, MG will become a user of eMetra's 
platform. 
Michael Hutchinson, Joint Chief Executive of MG plc, said: "We are delighted 
that so many customers to date have transferred their business on to the 
Internet - we see this trend as increasing significantly in the coming 
months. It is proving attractive to new customers and enables us to give our 
existing customers a more efficient service."

City: MG plans to launch metals website

MG, the international metals trader, yesterday unveiled plans to develop an 
internet marketplace for trading non-ferrous metals, in direct competition 
with the London Metals Exchange (LME). 
The joint venture with the Internet Capital Group (ICG) and private equity 
fund Safeguard International will establish a worldwide business-to-business 
e-commerce platform for non-ferrous metals. This will include physical 
trading and the trading of options and futures contracts.
MG shares soared 140 1/2 to 337 1/2 p. 
"We didn't go into this venture intending to put anyone out of business," 
said chairman Thomas McKeever. 
He added that the as-yet-unnamed new venture would attract new clients, 
particularly small and medium-sized companies who regard conventional LME 
trade as too costly and complex. 
He said he also hoped to open up the derivatives market to smaller players. 
"When you develop a global marketplace you attract, presumably, most industry 
participants," he added. 
Safeguard and Nasdaq-listed ICG, which already has stakes in more than 50 
companies offering online trading in sectors such as industrial chemicals, 
plastics and cattle, have invested a total of $25 million in the venture, 
taking 30 and 45pc stakes respectively. 
MG, the world's largest copper merchant, will hold an initial 25pc, with an 
option to increase that to 50pc within eight months. The company, which 
floated last September at 205p, after being spun off from German engineering 
group Metallgesellschaft, will continue to operate its internet trading 
system Mits for existing customers. It began live internet dealing of 
aluminium and copper in January.

MG expects MITS to be a hit.

DUSSELDORF -- Only one week after London Metal Exchange trader 
Metallgesellschaft Ltd. launched its web site system that allows trade 
execution services on the Internet, it is optimistic that the concept will be 
a hit. 
"It's been quite extraordinary," said Alex Health, MG's director of 
e-commerce systems. "We've had something like 300 reactions so far from both 
existing customer companies as well as new ones logging on." He said that the 
non-customers entering MG'S site (www.mgltd.co.uk) ranged from large groups 
MG had wanted to make contact with for a longtime to small companies that 
Heath said he'd never heard of. 

"Of course, it's LME Week now, so we are busy with socializing and making 
contacts there before we can reply to the requests we've received," Heath 
said. He noted that LME Week was one important factor in launching the 
Metallgesellschaft Internet Trading System (MITS) in time to display it at 
Broker's House by Tuesday evening. MG Plc's recent floatation also provided a 
major motivation for the project to raise MG's profile, he said: 
Heath said that MITS has not had an immediate effect on trading volumes 
beyond the regular market, activity, but 70. customers so far had used the 
facility for deals. He added that MITS might soon contribute to MG's customer 
base, but it would take some time for new parties attracted to the site to be 
registered as regular customers. 
At the beginning of LME Week, few LME trading companies were prepared to 
comment on MITS and its possible effect on metals trading. MG's presentations 
at the LME event were aimed at providing a clearer picture. "I'd be extremely 
disappointed if the idea didn't spread as the Internet will inevitably be a 
big factor in trading," Heath said. He noted that MG put itself under 
pressure by moving before some other company with a similar 
project-in-the-making could enter the scene. 
"Speed is a definite factor in the Internet, and we can claim to be leading 
into the new millennium in this regard," he said, adding that MG received 
many "flattering comments" from brokers. 
Peter Sellars of Barclays Bank Plc conceded that "certainly they got there 
before anybody else" but added that "they won't have very much of a lead 
time." He said that the Internet was going to be the way of the future and 
that Barclays was making similar preparations, but so far offered a web site 
order trading system only for non-metallic futures. He noted, however, that 
web site trading would not satisfy all requirements. "It's great for the 
small bread-and-butter stuff, but for long-term contracts it's gonna be 
tricky, isn't it," Sellars said. 
A spokesman at Triland Metals Ltd., another LME member, questioned whether MG 
was really embracing technology or vice versa. "It could be a gimmick for 
customers, and it doesn't really mean they're successful with enlarging their 
customer base," he said. He noted that people were always interested in 
coming close but weren't necessarily keen on taking the final step. He said 
that Triland had no immediate plans for a similar service and that it was 
confining its web site plans to statistics and other basic information. "They 
jumped the gun to a certain extent, but we'll have to see if it's successful 
or not."

MG Launches First Internet Metals Trade Service
A Wall Street Journal Europe Roundup

10/05/1999
The Wall Street Journal Europe

LONDON -- MG PLC has launched the first Internet-based metals futures trading 
system. 
MG, which went public on the London Stock Exchange in September, offers a 
full trading and execution service on the London Metals Exchange.
The system, which is called MITS, will be supported by a real-time price 
screen for all the metals traded on the LME and includes a multi-currency 
facility. The LME trades copper, aluminium, lead, zinc, nickel, tin, silver 
and aluminium alloy. 
In addition, customers can listen to a direct voice commentary from the floor 
of the LME during trading sessions. 
Technical analysis and market research on all LME metals is available and 
regularly updated. Customers can also access their position and valuation 
statements over a secure encrypted link to the firm's computer system. 
MITS can only be accessed by registered customers of Metallgesellsc haft 
Limited, MG's LME brokerage and trading arm. 
"It is a customer service and it is live now to our registered customers," 
said Michael Hutchinson, MG's joint chief executive. 
MG's customers will also be able to listen to a direct-voice commentary from 
the floor of the LME during trading sessions. They will also be able to 
access their position and valuation statements over a secure encrypted link 
to MG's computer system, MG said. 
The LME is the world's largest non-ferrous metals market with 14 ring-dealing 
members who participate in the twice-daily important open-outcry sessions. 
The LME settlement prices for metals which are realized in the official 
morning trading sessions are the benchmark reference prices for most of the 
world's physical contracts. 
Outside the open-outcry sessions, LME business takes place over a 24-hour 
period via an inter-office telephone market. 
"We are always interested in any new uses of technology. We will watch this 
with interest," an LME spokeswoman said. 
MG said it intended to develop its website to eventually include real-time 
physical metal prices and premiums. 
MG's system is the latest in a series of Internet commodity trading systems.

Mark:

I write this email to discuss the Energy and Developing Products conference
in Houston on March 6th, 2001.  Attached please find a copy of the latest
agenda for your perusal.  Mark Taylor graciously helped me find speakers for
the conference.  However, I just want to confirm with you your availability
to speak on the Panel Discussion on Recent Events and the Growth of New
Products at 9:30 AM.
 <<spkeragendaEnergy.doc>>
The issues to be discussed include:  Power Price Spikes; Delivery Failures;
OPEC Production Decisions; Emissions Trading; and New and Developing
Products.  Christophe Chassard will also speak on the panel.  This is a
difficult panel to find speakers.  We have invited Steve Bunkin to join
panel and still waiting for his reply.   If he accepts then we will have
just three speakers on the panel.  Christophe said he is comfortable
speaking about OPEC production decisions and to a lesser extent power price
spikes.

Let me know if you are available to speak.  And if so, what topics on panel
you would feel comfortable discussing.

Thanks,
Liz

As we have discussed, I think we probably need someone other than Dan.  I 
don't think there is any need to lay everything out on use of lawyers in 
Canada.  I agree with your comments on the business model for lawyers.  We 
can't ignore that.  Let's generally talk that through with Jim.

Regards,

Mark

	03/07/2001 08:46 AM
		 
		 To: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT

		 Subject: Canadian Counsel

Mark, a few thoughts:

1.  Dan Fournier asked me to go to lunch so he could update me on his "very 
positive meeting" with Jim and you.  I told Dan, politely, that I am very 
tired of talking to the issue and really have nothing more to add.  I hope 
that is OK with you.  To be honest, I am really tired of talking to the issue 
and dealing with Dan Fournier's political maneuvering, but I am also 
concerned that it seems apparent that the result of his meeting with you and 
Jim is that he thinks he is back in the saddle with Enron.  I have lost trust 
and confidence in Dan Fournier and as I mentioned Dan's approach within 
Blakes becomes exclusive and results in inefficient allocation of Blakes 
resources to our files.  He tries to conquer the client and thereby alienates 
the talent within his firm.  I know for a fact, after he has squeezed others 
out on our work and his mismanagement of this issue with Enron, that if Dan 
is back in the saddle, many of his partners will not been keen on doing our 
work under Dan's terms.  I also know that there is a philosophy in Houston to 
commercial people not having say in legal retainers, but I believe that the 
senior commercial people who are responsible for the transactions, 
particularly in a smaller office in a smaller market, have an important place 
in the relationship, and in that regard, I know Fournier has lost the trust 
and confidence of Rob Milnthorp.

2.  Regarding Donahue Ernst and Young, it should be borne in mind that the 
initial contact to doing work at their firm was through Jordan Mintz and 
Morris Clark on the tax side.  I also know Jordan thinks well not just of 
their firm but of the multidisciplinary business model.  I also think that 
Jim needs to understand that the business model is likely not going away, and 
likely to expand in Canada, the US and Europe and is something we likely 
cannot ignore.  Also, the circumstances you will recall for us using DEY 
initially was on regulatory and contracting issues affecting the retail 
market, where the incumbent firms with any experience in the area were all 
conflicted and in an area where Blakes is particularly weak in Calgary.  (We 
first approached Stikemans, which had conflict with Enmax, and Bennett Jones, 
which had a conflict with ATCO.  Other firms which we do not typically use 
but which had experience also had conflicts.  After that, I solicited written 
propsals from both Blakes and DEY and interviewed with them with the retail 
team.)  Frankly, DEY has done good work for us.  E&Y is also very well 
situated on the market development side in Ontario, a leading proponent of 
deregulation of the Ontario market, and worked with us to set up our systems 
in Toronto for market opening.

3.  Should I e-mail to Jim a proposed agenda for our call on the 20th 
outlining the firms we currently use in different capacities in Canada?  
Blakes, Bennett Jones, Stikemans, Oslers, Donahue E&Y, or is a less structurd 
call anticipated?

Peter.


Peter.

It is true that there is no wall -- however, it is geographically separate.  
The equity trading is the end portion of the floor.  There are three hallways 
that go to equity trading, each about 10 feet long.  It would not be possible 
to hear anything said outside of the equity trading area.  Robert Bruce is 
working on updating our policy and procedures in Houston and by copy hereof 
ask him to update you.

Thanks for the enquiry.

I've had discussions with Gary this week and am now working out how soft the 
wall can be in light of that!  I understand from Gary that in Houston the 
Chinese walls are not as hard as I imagined ie no physical wall or separate 
security pass system.  Please confirm. Many thanks

had Kim Kaase (extension 35349) return my call.

Listed below are the next steps:

Review the space plans and give your comments
You mentioned one of your major concerns is size of offices
Provide information regarding any speciality areas such as the number of file 
rooms, the number of conference rooms the department needs, etc.

In summary, the next steps are to determine the requirements for the

Joe Hartsoe, Rick Shapiro, or Jim Steffes can fill you in on the details of 
what FERC did today.  One question you need to think about is how their 
decision on price caps affects any contracts which we may have indexed to 
California's spot market.  The way it reports the market clearing price will 
change fundamentally if prices over 150 will be accepted but not used to 
clear the market for all bids.  So, if we are using this as a reference price 
in our contracts it may trigger the need to look for alternatives.

USA: FACTBOX-FERC details changes for Calif power market.

11/01/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
on Wednesday approved several actions to revamp California's power market 
over the next two years. 
Immediate changes include the following:
* Eliminate requirement that three utilities - Pacific Gas & Electric, San 
Diego Power and SoCal Edison - must sell all of their power to and buy all 
their power from the state Power Exchange (PX). 
* Require market participants to schedule 95 percent of their transactions in 
the day-ahead markets to reduce chronic underscheduling of load and 
generation and over-reliance on the ISO's real-time imbalance market to meet 
supply. FERC also proposed a penalty charge for scheduling deviations in 
excess of 5 percent of hourly load requirements. 
* Temporary modification of the single-price auction so bids above $150 MWh 
cannot set the market clearing price paid to all bidders. 
* Establish independent, non-stakeholder governing boards for the California 
Power Exchange (PX) and Independent System Operator (ISO). 
* Create congestion management design proposal. 
* Establish generation inter-connection procedures. 
* Explore alternatives to the single price auction by the ISO and PX. 
* Develop market rules to ensure sufficient supply is available to meet load 
and reserve requirements. 
FERC also approved changes to protect wholesale customers from unreasonable 
rates during the time it will take to adopt longer-term market remedies. The 
following price mitigation measures will remain in effect until Dec. 31, 
2002: 
* Single-price auctions for all sales in the ISO and PX markets at or below 
$150 MWh. The single price would be used for all load which clears below this 
amount in the auction. 
* If an auction does not clear below the $150 MWh level, suppliers who choose 
to bid above $150 would be paid their price bid. In other words, the highest 
bid of the day, if above $150 per MWh, would no longer be the clearing price 
paid by all. 
* Sellers receiving above $150 per MWh would be required to report their bids 
to FERC on a weekly basis and provide certain cost information to the agency. 
* The ISO and PX would be required to report monthly information on such 
bids, allowing FERC to monitor competitive conditions and assure just and 
reasonable rates. Sellers would be subject to potential refund liability but 
no lower than their marginal or opportunity cost if FERC finds 
non-competitive conditions. The potential refund liability would extend the 
full 24 months it would take to implement the market reforms.

An incredible NETA fact I didn't mention today on our call (but which I think 
you'll find of interest) is that UK power prices in the new balancing market 
this weekend hit an amazing o34,000/MWh (no typo!).

Mark,

The Frontera transaction is making some additional progress and I am 
currently scheduled to fly to Tampa this evening to finalize the deal.  Per 
our conversation, I have revised the risk memo and am forwarding an original 
to you.  Please let me know if you think the memo is worded to strongly or 
otherwise requires some additional revision.  David Portz also sent you 
another risk memo which relates exclusively to the provision of qualified 
scheduling services (which will also be provided to Frontera under the Energy 
Management Services Agreement). 


On another note, I have received several calls from people who have read the 
latest Enron newsletter.  Apparently I am listed as being transferred out of 
ENA.  Is there anything that I should know?  Please advise.

Stuart

First of all, thank you very much for this last push. The list of pending 
issues with the Mexican counterparties has really come down in the last two 
weeks, and we really appreciate your efforts down here...You will find the 
status report on this file, which still needs some work to be done, but I

		 Subject: Details on All Employee Meeting

On Thursday afternoon, March 22, at 2:30PM in the Doubletree La Salle 
Ballroom, we will have an All Employee Meeting to discuss Enron Engineering 
and Operations Services (EEOS).  Mark Frevert and Dan Leff will join Brian 
Stanley, John Gillis, and the two of us for this discussion.  Led by Mark and 
Dan, we have been on a corporate journey to determine the best method to 
provide a resource base for the building , operating, and maintaining of our 
existing and planned major assets. The discussions evolved around two major 
issues. First,  most of the engineering and project management resources were 
concentrated in the former EE &CC, but operational resources were spread 
among several groups.  OEC provided operational support to some, but not all 
Enron assets.  Second, the clear need for both the engineering and 
operational resources was in Wholesale not Retail (EES).  There will be some 
need to help EES bridge into Industrial clients, but this need is minor 
compared to the requirements of Wholesale.  As a benefit of the time Mark and 
Dan plus other Executive Committee Members put into the decision  to form 
EEOS, we believe we are correctly positioned to effectively address Enron's 
major project needs.  Our Thursday meeting is an open forum to discuss these 
and other issues you might have with our new or perhaps more clearly defined 
position.  

We look forward to seeing you on Thursday.

Keith Dodson 
Chief Operating Officer - EEOS

Ken Bean
Vice President - Operational Energy Corp.

Primary.  I think we should give an ultimatum to Cargill.  I could say that 
all Enron trading is to hedge risk too!

Thanks for letting me know.  She seemed to be a wonderful person.  Things are 
going well for me and my family.  We bought a place at Silver Shells in 
Destin recently.  I am hopeful we will get there some during the summers.

Bill, I am thinking I could do it May 14 or May 21, if that works for 
others.  I will confirm next week if those dates work.  Mark

Terry, thanks for your reply.  As our thinking starts to mature, I would like 
to talk to you about what we see in the Japanese markets re energy.  Perhaps, 
we can talk in New York in November at the ISDA board meeting.  Take care.

I think partnering with a lawfirm would be a good idea re documentation.  
However, I am not sure the ISDA board is likely to pick a proposal that 
includes a competitor of the stature of Enron.  I will call ISDA and try to 
get a read on what ISDA wants to do which is not clear at this point.

Regards,

Mark

Mark - 

Attached is the proposed language for a letter explaining the reasons to 
postpone the securitization deal.  Larry Lawyer would like to send this 
letter to the investment banks, potential investors, rating agencies and the 
deal team.  

Please review the statement and give me a call at X33242 with any comments or 
changes.  

I have also attached the final draft of the Q&A.  I appreciated all the help 
from the legal department on this document.  Shari and Janet had several 
comments that I think will be very helpful.

Thanks again

Traci

Kristin:
Kevin is very concerned with this charge.  Why is litigation now being billed 
up front?  Why is there a 50% increase in corporate legal?  Why is there a 
100% increase in corporate secretary?  Why are we billed for the library when 
we use primarily electronic sources?  Could you please work on the answers to 
these questions and get back to me.

Mark - Enron Canada is on the verge of entering into a 3 year fixed price 48 
MW power sale to Ivaco Rolling Mills Limited Partnership and Ivaco Inc.  The 
sale is a back to back transaction with the British Energy supply source.  
The electricity purchase agreement is based off of the industrial one-off 
form that was developed to do back to back deals with the British Energy 
supply source.  That form has been approved by Peter Keohane and previously 
reviewed by Elizabeth Sager.  A copy of the Ivaco agreement is attached.  If 
you would like further information about this transaction please let me know.

Thanks very much and thanks for the card.  Hoping you and your family had a

		 Subject: New Security and Human Rights Policy - Legal Comments

Rob has asked me to collect legal department views on the attached statement 
of principles regarding Security and Human Rights that Enron Corp is 
considering endorsing. These have been worked out over the past several 
months by a task force of the US and UK governments, along with 
representatives of industry (including Enron) and NGOs (including Amesty and 
Human Rights Watch) under the auspices of Secretary fo State Albright and 
Foreign Secretary Cook.  As a result, we really don't  have the ability to 
change the text, which is fixed. 

As you know, Enron is very concerned about human rights issues because of 
their intrinsic value and their community relations impacts.These guidelines 
would be in addition to the Human Rights Policy Statement the Enron board 
adopted last year, which really do not touch on security matters as such. I 
have sent this to each of your since your business units are those that have 
the most extensive operations in the developing countries in which these 
issues are of primary concern.  (I am separately collecting comments/concerns 
from within EES and EECC.)

The Enron effort on this guideline project has been lead by Lauren Goldblatt 
of the Corp. PR group. Lauren has run the attached drafts past Mike Hicks and 
Pete Vandergam at Corp. Security for their views of whether this can be 
implemented by Enron.  We as the legal department have been asked to express 
our view on are the following:

(a) Are there any show stoppers that would argue that Enron should not 
publicly express its "endorsement" of these polices?
(b) If Enron were to express its endorsement of the policy statement, what if 
any material problems do you think your business line might encounter in 
implementing the policy?
(c) Do you see any unintended practical or legal consequences that might 
arise from Enron publicly adopting or endorsing this as policy?

Please take an hour few hours to read through the materials, or have one of 
your lawyers do so. You might need to consult with your operation personnel 
for their practical views as well.   I would be grateful if you could express 
any concerns you may see with the guidelines by November 7 (Wednesday) so 
that I can coordinate comments and get the responses out.   (The deadline for 
Enron and other companies to express their endorsement of the policy has been 
extended from the November 8 deadline expressed in the attached to November 
15. To allow time for Enron to deal with responses, we have been asked to get 
our feed back to Lauren by November 8 (Thursday).)

You cane-mail your comments or phone them to  me at 713-646-6309. If I get 
suffucient expressions of interest for a conference call by Monday, I will 
set up a call in number for Wednesday morning US. 

Thanks, I appreciate your views and comments.

John, Rob and I have talked and   Rob would like you to take the lead on 
this.  Deborah, I need you to work  with  John S. to see how our 
international EES business (Europe, Mexico, etc.) might be   affected by this 
and whether we take this position.  I am sure Rob and JOhn will  have the 
history and expert opinion as to how this should be handled, and my guess is, 
this issue primarily affects EECC at this time.  Maybe one of the Apache 
lawyers can take the lead for the traditional EES business.   Rob will be in 
next week and then going out of town and I will pick up for him then.

Subject: Security and Human Rights

Rob and Vicki:

Over the past few months we have participated in an initiative aimed at 
developing a voluntary set of guidelines governing human rights and security 
arrangements.   I would greatly appreciate your thoughts, review, and sign 
off on the guidelines.  

Should we agree to endorse the principles, we must send a letter to the U.S. 
State Department by November 8, 2000.     I have attached a fact sheet as 
well as the revised principles for your review.   

The principles and signatories will be announced by Madeline Albright and 
Secretary Robin Cook in November. 

Thank you for time and consideration on this.  Please do not hesitate to call 
with any questions.  I can be reached either by cell phone (917) 821-0724 or 
by  voicemail at 212-702-3916.

Best Regards, 


Lauren

		 Subject: Single Master Agreement


As we discussed at the Board meeting last week, the impetus for a single
master agreement will need to come from several fronts, but especially from
within each of your firms. The various trade associations will be most
responsive to the idea if they are hearing strong support for a single
agreement from decision-making levels within member firms. We will
separately continue or commence a dialogue with the trade associations that
sponsor various agreements or are active in the areas of the financial
products that would be covered by such an agreement.

The trade associations we have identified as likely to be important to this
project are the following:

Securities Industry Association (US)
The Bond Market Association (US)
International Securities Market Association (principally Europe)
European Banking Federation (Europe)
The Foreign Exchange Committee (NY, London, Tokyo)
Emerging Markets Traders Association

The following associations may also be helpful to the process:

Australian Financial Markets Association
British Bankers Association
Japan Securities Dealers Association
Canadian Bankers Association
International Primary Markets Association (London-based)
ACI (The Foreign Exchange Association)(Paris-based)_

If your firm is active in any of these organizations, we encourage you to
discuss as soon as possible with your representative within that
organization the need to support the development of a single agreement for
financial products and urge them to express their support to the
associations. If it would be useful to share with them the thoughts in my
memorandum to the board, please feel free to do so. I have attached an
edited version which deletes the last couple of sections on my discussions
with the BMA, the Russo-Carlin group, Ernie Patrikis's letter and possible
approaches for ISDA.

I will try to contact each of you over the course of the next week to get
your feedback. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not
hesitate to email me or call me (212-332-2554)

Bob

Mary:

Spring break for most schools in Houston for 2001 is March 12 through March 
17.  Otherwise, I am open in Feb and Mar at this time.  I think London is a 
better venue for an energy conference than Amsterdam.  Also, I think we will 
eventually want to do an energy trading presentation on Japan --  maybe at 
the update on October 26.

Ragards,

I would like to visit with you on staffing your upcoming 4th Quarter legal 
needs.  I understand that Enron North America may be looking for additional 
outside counsel to help document a number of production payments currently 
under negotiation.  Haynes and Boone has an energy finance team with 
expertise in oil and gas, tax, derivatives and energy finance that is ready 
to help. 

I would like your advice on how Haynes and Boone can best approach your 
production payment group. Please give me a call.

Mark,

I am not sure I follow this but I will attempt to present my interpretation=
=20
of your note.

I am only restrained from trading those items in clause one if I am=20
responsible for trading them at Enron, and "equities" falls under=20
"securities" in clause one.
"Equities" fall under clause one and are therefore not included in clause=
=20
two. Therefore, since I do not trade equities for Enron, I can trade them o=
n=20
my personal account.

Brent Crude futures, I would argue, are "financial instruments," included i=
n=20
clause one. I am not responsible for trading them for Enron. If they fall=
=20
under clause one they are not included in clause two. Does this mean, since=
=20
they are not in clause two and I do not trade them for Enron, I can trade=
=20
them on my personal account?

Perhaps you could give me a call, +44 207 783 4928.

Thank you,

Dave

them, so we worked very hard to complete them as quickly as we could. 

Please forward to me the executed Joint Defense Agreement so that I can

Let me know if you have any questions.

Mark,

 Thanks for looking into the People's to People program for me.    Instead of 
asking Cliff for full funding perhaps it would be "better received" to 
suggest 50% funding?   If it doesn't look like that would work either, would 
it be ok with Enron's policy to go on my own?

 Thanks.  (I hope that I'm not being a nuisance about this Mark, if so, just 
say the word and I'll drop it!)

 Monica

Mark,

Thanks for the help.  I have worked with Anne Koehler a number of times in 
the past; however, since this is specifically Net Works and may be more of an 
acquisition than an investment, I wasn't sure who to contact.  Please find 
attached a brief description of the Altra Gas Pipeline Software Business, 
along with CIBC's Confidentiality Agreement.  I am sure you will have changes 
to the CA, as a result, I will try to identify the appropriate contact at the 
bank.  You may want to give me a call and/or Tom Gros to make sure all of his 
concerns are addressed.

		 Subject: Cuiab? EPE -- Fine

FYI, I received verbal notice today that EPE has been fined in the amount of 
R$2.2 million (approx US$1.1 million) for failure to comply with its IPP 
license -- specifically, the failure to dispatch at 450 MW per the 
instructions of the ONS.  Aneel previously had delivered a notice of 
noncompliance to EPE and our response was delivered to Aneel on Friday, so 
the fine probably crossed our response in the mail.  

This is another salvo in the ongoing dispute as to whether our PPA, which 
pre-dates the new regulatory scheme, is to be treated as an exception or 
whether it needs to be completely renegotiated in order to be able to comply 
with the current regs.  In any event, it is not good news.  I will keep you 
posted as I get more details.

Regards,
 John

Hi Larry:

I think your best shot at Enron would be in paper with Bryan.  I think we got

Hi Mark:

I heard from Ted Bland last week. He said that George still has not tested 
the equipment and Bryan has not met with the COO about hiring yet. 

I am looking forward to an offer coming in this week from a small public 
company that wants me to develop a new business development group and 
increase their sales from $10MM to $50MM over the next couple of  years and 
get the stock price up. 

I am still operating the fitness company but it is quickly coming to an end 
due to running out of money so I am looking forward to finding a new position 
in the next couple of weeks. 

Everyone is settled into school and doing well. What is new with you and your 
family? 

Debbie and I sent you and Susan a gift a month or so ago for having Bryan 
stay with you. Did you receive it? 

I look forward to hearing from you.

Larry

Edison/NA/Enron@Enron
		 Subject: Venezuela EPC Dispute Resolution

Ned, Andy and I have discussed the dispute resolution provisions of the 
possible EPC Contract between Enron LNG Atlantic Limited (EGM affiliate) and 
EE&CC for Project Jose.

Attached is Ned's memo outlining our conclusions at this time. In essence, we 
thought that:

Only upon the parties' mutually agreement would the use of a qualified 
independent expert (arbitrator) subject to AAA rules (note: the current 
language in the draft would need to be changed to clarify that AAA rules 
would apply to the IE's proceedings) be the appropriate mechanism for the 
expeditious handling of a narrow group of technical disputes ("Technical 
Disputes"). Primarily, these would be disputes over the adjustment of the 
contract price for a change order or the date of a milestone or completion 
date due a change order. 
In the interests of an expeditious resolution, the current draft should be 
changed to reflect that the IE's decisions would be final, and 
non-appealable, as contrasted with the current draft where in certain 
instances they can be appealed to the three-arbitrator panel.
The "baseball arbitration" approach required in the current draft should be 
used by the IE for these Technical Disputes only, and would not apply to 
disputes handled by the three-arbitrator Panel. The commercial people on the 
Enron LNG side of the table like baseball arbitration b/c they believe it 
mitigates the possibility of claims inflation by the Contractor in these 
change order price disputes. 
All other disputes under the Contract would be handled by a three-arbitrator 
panel ("Panel") subject to AAA rules, which would also handle all Technical 
Disputes if the parties cannot mutually agree to an IE.
The Dispute Resolution Section of the draft Contract should be refined in 
some areas to provide greater clarity. Andy and Ned are in the process of 
doing this.

If you have any questions before you visit with Vicki or John, please advise 
any of us.

Alan

Subject: Proposed Changes to Business Practices Based on the California
 Energy Crisis

Over the past several months, we have reviewed in detail our trading 
contracts and the companies through which we conduct our trading business in 
California.  In order to reduce Enron's non-market risks ( e.g. legal, credit 
and regulatory) in the volatile commodity markets in California or any " 
future California", we propose the following changes:

1.    Mandatory Uniform Set-Off Provisions in All Trading Contracts for All 
Commodities -- set-off language varies commodity by commodity in trading 
contracts.  Set-off is one of the most critical tools available to Enron in a 
major default situation and it is critical to have set-off language and to 
have it be uniform commodity to commodity so that Enron can get the best 
advantage from set-off and not just the least common denominator.

2.     Master Netting Agreements For Appropriate Counterparties With Multiple 
Masters With Significant Opposite Exposures -- where it is necessary to have 
multiple masters with a counterparty, a "bridge" should be put in place 
between the masters whenever there is significant opposite exposures under 
the two or more masters.

3.     Merge EPMI into ENA -- power trades are done through EPMI.  Merging 
EPMI into ENA and conducting power trades through ENA is much more efficient 
from both a credit and legal point of view.

4.     No Automatic Termination for a Bankruptcy Event -- in the PGE/SCE 
situation, it should be the non-defaulting party's (Enron in this case) 
option to terminate rather than an automatic termination on "inability to pay 
debts as they become due".

Let me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts 
or entities through which we conduct our trading.  I believe these changes 
will (i) improve efficiency, (ii) reduce risks, (iii) develop the opportunity 
to do more business with certain counterparties and (iv) substantially 
improve Enron's position in the next California type market.  The long range 
goal is to conduct as much as possible of the trading business through a 
single entity and a single or limited number of standardized agreements.

Mark,

As a follow-up to our  monday meeting, I want to reiterate our need to have a 
local dispute resolution mechanism for merchant (trading) activities.  My 
suggestion is to automatically allow ICC arbitration (English or Portuguese) 
in Sao Paulo for deals out to 4-5 years and smaller than 200 average 
megawatts, with a case-by-case review for deals of longer maturity or larger 
average capacity.  I appreciate the fact that this requires some discussion 
of company policy, and I am grateful for any help you can give.   I strongly 
believe that we will not be able to prosecute  a successful trading operation 
without a meaningful dispute resolution forum in Sao Paulo.

It was good to see you again, and I look forward to your continuing interest 
in South American trading.

--DMR

Mark,

I am currently negotiating an Option to Obtain an Easement in connection with 
our peaking power plant in Caledonia, Mississippi.  As you know, the 
Caledonia facility is currently scheduled to be sold to Cinergy Capital & 
Trading, Inc.  The anticipated closing date is March 27, 2001 (but this is 
subject to change depending on when we obtain the requisite regulatory 
approval).

One of the things that ENA was seeking to do, prior to deciding to sell the 
plant, was to establish a second interconnection to the Southern Company 
(currently Caledonia is interconnected to TVA).  In pursuit of this second 
interconnection, certain ENA developers were charged with the responsibility 
for obtaining options for easements.  The easements were needed in order to 
run the transmission wires from the plant to the point of the interconnection 
with Southern.  To date, we have obtained all but one of the required options 
(the "Galiano Option").

We are obligated to cooperate with Cinergy from now until the closing date in 
pursuit of the Galiano Option.  Ms. Galiano and her lawyer have insisted upon 
adding an indemnity in the form of easement which requires the grantee 
(Caledonia Power I, LLC) to indemnify the grantor against liabilities arising 
from grantee's use of the easement.  They have adamantly rejected, however, 
my request that the indemnification be limited to actual damages (and that 
special, consequential and punitive damages be waived).  

Cinergy has asked us to execute the Galiano Option without the waiver of 
consequential damages and I am seeking your permission to do so.

I think that this should be acceptable from ENA's perspective for several 
reasons:

1)  It is likely (99%+) that we sell Caledonia Power I, LLC (the proposed 
counterparty to the Galiano Option) in the next several weeks;
2)  The Galiano Option is structured as an option to obtain an easement and 
the waiver of consequential damages issue only arises if the option is 
actually exercised; and 
3)  If for some odd reason the sale doesn't go through, we finally decide to 
complete the second interconnection and we exercise the option for easement, 
we can probably mitigate our risk by procuring additional insurance.

Please let me know, at your earliest possible convenience, if I may proceed 
with the execution of the Galiano Option.  Many thanks.

Stuart

Dear Mark,

Just wanted to let you know that I sent one of our young Japanese analysts 
along to an ISDA committee meeting earlier this week. His name is Takuro 
Shioda and he has been working on the commercial side with Bank of Tokyo 
Mitsubishi, with whom we are currently negotiating an ISDA master.

The ISDA people here are trying generally to get more non-legal 
non-documentary  trading types involved in the Japanese language committees 
because of how valuable this sort of feedback is in terms of practical 
application of the ISDA docs and they have indicated that they would be 
particularly  grateful for help from Enron in this regard.

None of our Japanese traders have any real ISDA experience but I have taken 
this as a first step.  We cant do much more for ISDA on this front at this 
point in time but obviously as we put ISDA masters in place and trade under 
them this situation will change.

Jane

Joe:

I think there are several positive things to point out.  ISDA is opening an 
office in Japan as of April 13.  They have already hired one person and are 
looking for addtional people.  More importantly, Goldman moved one of its top 
traders worldwide, Tom Montag, from London to Tokyo and is generally beefing 
up the resources in Japan.  IBJ has contacted me about energy trading and 
asked for copies of confirms and says there is growing interest in the market 
place.  That's all I can think of for now.

Take care,

Mark

		 Subject: Conflicts Question


Mark:

I am attaching a copy of a brief memo I received from one of my partners in 
our Houston office about a potential representation of a company called 
Centrans, which apparently is a partner with Enron in a Guatemala power 
project.  Centrans apparently plans to sell a piece of its interest to a 
Fund, in which Enron also owns and interest (although I do not know how much).
We would represent Centrans in selling its interest to the Fund.  I am not 
sure, but I do not get the sense from my conversation with my partner that 
Enron plans to take an active role in the Fund purchase.  So, from a 
conflicts analytical standpoint, this would seem to be analogous to LeBoeuf 
representing a buyer in connection with the sale of an asset to a corporation 
in which Enron is a shareholder.

Do you have any concerns with LeBoeuf representing Centrans on this sale?  
Are there any unique facts or circumstances here that you may be aware of 
that could create a potential problem from your standpoint?  I assume this 
transaction would fall within your "world" but, if not, is there somebody 
else that I should check with on this?  We understand that Thelen Reid & 
Priest is representing the Fund.

Thanks, as usual, Mark, for your consideration.  Perhaps you could just reply 
to this e-mail or ask Janette to give me a call if it is ok.

John

John:

I talked with Mark Haedicke this morning regarding the best way to get you 
connected for the Monday morning staff meetings.  He would like you to let 
both him and I know (possibly by the preceding Friday Houston time) at what 
number he can call you to conference you into the meeting each Monday morning.

We discussed getting a bridgeline; however, it is best if Mark calls the 
various participants and adds them in by conference call.  

Thank you.

Bob:  This is something we are working on at Enron.  Is this something ISDA 
has interest in taking a lead on?  I think ISDA could add value by developing 
a standard approach to e-signatures.

		 Subject: E-Signature Protocol

Mark:

Pursuant to our discussion last week, below is a rough draft of a proposal 
for an electronic signature protocol, which could be presented to ISDA for 
further consideration and discussion after we have further discussed:

E-Signature Protocol

Objective: In light of the enactment of the US federal legislation on 
electronic signatures (effective as of 10/1/00), a simple, reliable, and 
enforceable protocol should be established to facilitate the electronic 
execution of Master Agreements (and confirmations where required).  To 
facilitate the wider use of electronic contracts, this protocol could be 
endorsed by ISDA. Hopefully, it would become a standard that others would use 
for all types of contracts. Perhaps, if necessary or helpful, the adoption of 
the protocol could be done electronically by each party unilaterally agreeing 
to abide by it, possibly using the same type of approach ISDA used in 
connection with the introduction of the EMU currency a few years ago.  
Initially, the protocol would be primarily applicable to U.S. counterparties, 
but it could be expanded to non-U.S. counterparties as e-signature laws like 
the new U.S. law are enacted across the globe.

Basic Protocol:  By adopting the protocol, each counterparty would agree that 
the relevant agreement may be electronically signed by complying with the 
following steps:

1) The parties negotiate and agree on a final form the relevant agreement, 
and appoint one of the parties ("First Party") to prepare the document for 
electronic signature;

2) The First Party prepares the final form in the PDF format (e.g., the body 
of the text could not be modified) with the exception of the blank signature 
blocks for each party to be placed on the last page of the agreement;

3) An authorized signatory of the First Party electronically signs the 
agreement (Note: this electronic signature could be accomplished by 
inscribing an electronic handwritten signature or the signatory typing in 
his/her name and title in the blank signature block);

4) The agreement, as electronically signed by the First Party, is sent via 
electronic means (e.g., by e-mail) by the First Party to the other party 
("Second Party");

5) An authorized signatory of the Second Party  electronically signs the 
agreement (Note: this electronic signature could be accomplished by 
impressing an electronic handwritten signature or the signatory typing in 
his/her name and title in the signature block);

6) The agreement, as electronically signed by the Second Party, is sent via 
electronic means (e.g., by e-mail) by the Second Party to the First Party, 
accordingly, creating the fully executed agreement; and

7) Each party would be responsible for maintaining in its own electronic 
archives the agreement as electronically signed by the parties.

Also, the following could be considered: (a) adding to the protocol that each 
party,by adopting the protocol, agrees to be bound by any agreement entered 
into by means of the protocol, and any other appropriate language to enhance 
the enforceability of the "e-signature" process and (b) adding to the 
preprinted form of the Master Agreement, a provision whereby each party 
adopts the electronic signature protocol endorsed by ISDA as in effect from 
time to time.

Mark, I would be happy to discuss this draft proposal with you further at 
your convenience.



Regards, Alan

Mary: 
This is complicated for oil companies.  Mobil Exxon only does hedging.  Shell 
has at least two groups, with one doing mostly hedging and one doing mostly 
trading for profit.  BP Amoco is sort of in between.  It is very clear with 
respect to Cargill and El Paso and Shell -- each should be primary.  The 
companies may be trying to manipulate the rules by having the hedging 
organization send in the application.  
Let me know if you need other info.

This is the response I received from Shell when I requested that they
reapply at the Primary level.

I did tell him that there will be some energy/gas companies in the
Subscriber category who will be asked to move to the Primary category in
2001.  Those were firms that were members before we made the by-law change
to 'solely'.

I am of the thinking that in addition to Cargill, El Paso Energy and TXU
Europe Power, we would also ask BP Amoco and Mobil Exxon to all move to
Primary.  

Any suggestions...

Thanks,
Mary

Mary,
Thanks for your reply. Unfortunately I have to disagree with the Board of
Directors in this case! We are an end user of derivatives purely for hedging
purposes as part of our asset and liability management. This seems to
specifically exclude us from primary membership according to your website
definition. As I see that BP Amoco and Mobil Exxon are subscriber members,
it would seem strange that Shell would be considered in a different light.
Grateful if you could re submit our application for Subscriber Membership on
this basis.
Many thanks!

I forwarded your membership application to our Board of Directors and they
have indicated to me that Shell International Limited would appropriately
fall under our Primary membership category which is for institutions that
act as dealers in derivatives.  The annual dues would be US $25,000.

The Subscriber category is for end-users of derivatives.  

If you are still interested in joining, you can download the Primary
application form from our website (www.isda.org).

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Guys-

Dan Rogers is an absolute beast.  I am very impressed by the amount of 
workload he can handle, his appreciation for commercial objectives and his 
awesome attitude.  He maintains a very good balance between doing what he can 
do and knowing when to delegate stuff to outside counsel; no one I've worked 
with in the legal group has mastered this as well as Dan has.

People usually don't hesitate to complain, thought you may want to hear some 
good stuff too. 

Adios,

Andrew

Marcus and Louise

How are you?  I hope all is well and I wanted to let you know that I will be
in Houston at the end of next week with, probably, a couple of my colleagues
and I wondered if you might have any time to get together.

Depending on schedules, I should be with Alan Jowett who is head of our
energy practice, Stephane Brabant who heads our civil law energy practice in
Paris and Ralf Thaeter who leads the energy practice of Gleiss Lutz, the
German firm with whom we have a formal relationship.

We should be around from late on Wednesday 4th April until late afternoon on
Friday 6th April and it would be splendid if we were able to get some time
with you and, if you thought it appropriate, any of your colleagues who
would be interested to meet us.

Could I trouble you to let me know if there are any times that would suit?

Best wishes

Paul

PS We finished a NETA-related deal opposite an Enron team led by Ali Lloyd
and Paul Simons at about 1.30 am on Tuesday!

Paul

Hi Mark:

Luann Mitchell called me to schedule a trip to Houston on Wednesday 10/18 to 
meet with the paper group.

She has me set to meet with 

Bob Crane 10:30 , Ray Bowen 11:00,  Steven Klein 11:30, and Ed Quinn 12:00. 
Bryan will be out of town but told her that he has spoken with me several 
times and was confident in what these gentleman had to say.

Any thoughts, input, or suggestions?

Larry

there was a lot of extreme weather this year and I am looking to support 
that.  This is background info to support the arguments for standardized 
power contracts,  which are nearly agreed to.  Let me know what there is and

Mark -

I have been charting the progress of the website.  It appears to be moving 
along very well.  We hit a few snags on some of the data base issues, but 
have cleaned them up for now. 

In order to finalize a couple of areas I need to get from you any comments 
you may have on the "Welcome" information I previously forwarded, another 
copy of which I have attached below.  I also need to get from either you or 
Janette the version of the organization chart you want to have initially on 
the site.  

I have a meeting later today with the IT group working on the project.  I 
will give you a further update on the project after that meeting.

Bill, I called Shapiro about this and he said they were interested and would 
cover the meeting you told me about.  I would give Rick a call at this 
point.  Thanks.  Mark

Below are Mark Haedicke's revisions to the announcement.


The purpose of this memo is to share with you the new We are pleased to 
announce organizational changes that have been implemented in to the Enron 
South America legal department in response to the recent reorganization and 
realignment of the principal Enron Wholesale Services business units 
operating in the region, Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets. 

Randy Young, currently General Counsel of ESA, will be assuming new 
responsibilities within Enron.  Replacing him will be John Novak, who will 
become General Counsel of ESA, reporting to Mark Haedicke.  The ESA legal 
department will be responsible for supporting all Enron Americas and Enron 
Global Assets businesses in the region.  Additional legal resources, 
coordinated by Lance Schuler, will be provided from EWS - Legal in Houston to 
support ESA's wholesale activities.  John will also work closely with Bruce 
Lundstrom, General Counsel of EGA, to coordinate legal support with respect

new structure is attached.

We believe This new structure will enable us to continue to provide quality 
legal support across business lines within South America while improving 
coordination and providing additional support from Houston for Enron's 
existing operating businesses, as well as the new business development 
initiatives under way in the region.

John:

Let me know if you are ok with the following memo which would come from you 
and me to  the traders and senior originators:



Effective October 15, 2000, the retention period on tape recordings of trades 
done by telephone will be reduced from four months to one month.  The tapes 
regarding significant transactions may be retained for such longer period as 
approved in writing by both the Head Trader and the General Counsel.  Please 
propose those significant transactions on which you may wish to retain the 
tapes, prior to October 15, 2000, since the tapes on conversations older than 
one month will be destroyed on that date.  If you have any questions, please 
contact Mark Haedicke or Richard Sanders. 


We are still looking at moving to recording only the deal terms -- but that 
is a long term project.

Mark

Mark, I thought you might be interested in the attached note Elizabeth kindly 
sent to me.  I can't emphasize enough the number of significant issues we 
were able to accomplish in Blue Range, which included not just the first 
decision in Canada regarding the categorization of physicals and financials 
as forward contracts (we call them eligible financial contracts) entitled to 
protection under insolvency (which Elizabeth has referred to as the safe 
harbor), but also included:  the first decision in Canada that a shareholders 
claim against management for neglect, although normally an unsecured claim is 
subordinated in insolvency; a decision confirming rights of set-off both 
before and after the insolvency; and at least quadrupling our anticipated 
recovery by making a bid to by Blue Range's assets out of the insolvent 
estate.  Regards, Peter

Just wanted to let you know that all the great work in Blue Range is paying 
off in the US - citing Blue Range, a Houston bankruptcy court correctly 
decided that a gas contract was a forward contract relative to the US safe 
harbor provisions.  If you want a copy of the opinion let me know.

Hope all is well.

Dave and John:

I am rethinking the legal reports.  I am preparing a monthly trading and 
transactional summary, a litigation report and the TOP TEN legal risk 
report.  To me the last two are the most important.  On a conceptual basis, 
is that what you need or want to see?

Seth:

There is a new senior person that was just hired in Japan to be the head of 
the office.  You should find out that person's name and try to meet with that 
person in Japan as soon as you can.  I think Enron should try to steer one of 
the committees to focus on energy regulatory matters in a material way.  I am 
not sure what committtee that would be at this point.  I think you should 
have this conversation with the senior person and I will work on it at the 
board level.  

Let's keep comparing notes.

Mark

Although we have received a programme for this there is no mention of the

		 Subject: New Security and Human Rights Policy - Legal Comments

Rob has asked me to collect legal department views on the attached statement 
of principles regarding Security and Human Rights that Enron Corp is 
considering endorsing. These have been worked out over the past several 
months by a task force of the US and UK governments, along with 
representatives of industry (including Enron) and NGOs (including Amesty and 
Human Rights Watch) under the auspices of Secretary fo State Albright and 
Foreign Secretary Cook.  As a result, we really don't  have the ability to 
change the text, which is fixed. 

As you know, Enron is very concerned about human rights issues because of 
their intrinsic value and their community relations impacts.These guidelines 
would be in addition to the Human Rights Policy Statement the Enron board 
adopted last year, which really do not touch on security matters as such. I 
have sent this to each of your since your business units are those that have 
the most extensive operations in the developing countries in which these 
issues are of primary concern.  (I am separately collecting comments/concerns 
from within EES and EECC.)

The Enron effort on this guideline project has been lead by Lauren Goldblatt 
of the Corp. PR group. Lauren has run the attached drafts past Mike Hicks and 
Pete Vandergam at Corp. Security for their views of whether this can be 
implemented by Enron.  We as the legal department have been asked to express 
our view on are the following:

(a) Are there any show stoppers that would argue that Enron should not 
publicly express its "endorsement" of these polices?
(b) If Enron were to express its endorsement of the policy statement, what if 
any material problems do you think your business line might encounter in 
implementing the policy?
(c) Do you see any unintended practical or legal consequences that might 
arise from Enron publicly adopting or endorsing this as policy?

Please take an hour few hours to read through the materials, or have one of 
your lawyers do so. You might need to consult with your operation personnel 
for their practical views as well.   I would be grateful if you could express 
any concerns you may see with the guidelines by November 7 (Wednesday) so 
that I can coordinate comments and get the responses out.   (The deadline for 
Enron and other companies to express their endorsement of the policy has been 
extended from the November 8 deadline expressed in the attached to November 
15. To allow time for Enron to deal with responses, we have been asked to get 
our feed back to Lauren by November 8 (Thursday).)

You cane-mail your comments or phone them to  me at 713-646-6309. If I get 
suffucient expressions of interest for a conference call by Monday, I will 
set up a call in number for Wednesday morning US. 

Thanks, I appreciate your views and comments.

John, Rob and I have talked and   Rob would like you to take the lead on 
this.  Deborah, I need you to work  with  John S. to see how our 
international EES business (Europe, Mexico, etc.) might be   affected by this 
and whether we take this position.  I am sure Rob and JOhn will  have the 
history and expert opinion as to how this should be handled, and my guess is, 
this issue primarily affects EECC at this time.  Maybe one of the Apache 
lawyers can take the lead for the traditional EES business.   Rob will be in 
next week and then going out of town and I will pick up for him then.

Rob and Vicki:

Over the past few months we have participated in an initiative aimed at 
developing a voluntary set of guidelines governing human rights and security 
arrangements.   I would greatly appreciate your thoughts, review, and sign 
off on the guidelines.  

Should we agree to endorse the principles, we must send a letter to the U.S. 
State Department by November 8, 2000.     I have attached a fact sheet as 
well as the revised principles for your review.   

The principles and signatories will be announced by Madeline Albright and 
Secretary Robin Cook in November. 

Thank you for time and consideration on this.  Please do not hesitate to call 
with any questions.  I can be reached either by cell phone (917) 821-0724 or 
by  voicemail at 212-702-3916.

Best Regards, 


Lauren
