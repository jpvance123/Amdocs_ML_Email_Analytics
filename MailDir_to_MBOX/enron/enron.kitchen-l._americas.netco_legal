I have given Mark Taylor my comments on the financial forms and he will be revising them.  I have met with Van Hooser and Hodge to discuss gas and have spoken with Bradford to get his perspective on gas.  We will be narrowing the menu of forms, revising in respect of certain terms, and studying possible construct changes to assist in credit matters.  Mark mentioned next Tuesday as a target which I will try to meet.  The EOL forms will be completed first.  Any questions, call me.

We are making progress, but it is slow.  Below are listed the contracts or terms on which we need sign off from UBS Warburg.  I telephoned Brian Murtagh today and asked him to come down this week to Houston to help finalize all the forms by the end of the week.  He is coming on Thursday.  We also talked about getting sign off from tax and credit at the same time, so as not to delay things.  He is hopeful that no sign off will be required from Switzerland (re the bank netting issue) at least on an interim basis.

In regard to the counterparties we are going to focus on first -- I need a further prioritization of the list with approximately 160 counterparties that I believe you had prepared.  I think I need the top 50, the second 50 and so on.

I will be out on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday for my operations.  

Regards,

Mark Haedicke

Louise:

I am happy to provide you with the short form GTC today.  However, I believe that an on-line EEI will receive quicker market acceptance than the GTCs and that as a result more counterparties will start trading on-line in a shorter period of time. 

I have attached below a revised version of the on-line EEI for your consideration.

The on-line EEI is a very long document, I agree.  But there are now only 2 pages of Netco changes to the EEI that our counterparties will have to review, as opposed to 8 two column pages of GTCs.  (I have spoken with Elizabeth about how best to ensure quick acceptance of the on-line documentation, and we decided to cut our other changes to the EEI down to the bare bones.)  The EEI is a widely accepted power contract, and I believe that a large number of our counterparties will prefer to trade pursuant to an on-line EEI over a GTC.  (fyi, EPMI has 98 executed EEI contracts.)

Please call me so that we can discuss.  I'd really like a chance to convince you that the EEI is the way to go before we launch with the GTCs.

Thanks,

Leslie

We have determined (Vickers and Tycholiz and Hodge) that no interruptible gas is transacted on line, but certain firm gas descriptions excuse performance on the basis of normal pipeline constraints (without liability).  Therefore, for Phase 1 rollout no EOL interruptible/spot GTC is needed.  In Phase 3 they may consider adding some interruptible products on line.  They do want an over the counter interruptible GTC, which will be prepared.  In any event, all EOL physical gas will be sold online in Phase 1 under the Firm GTC (until masters are signed).  The Phase 1 EOL decision tree will then be if GISB master signed, up to 30 day firm gas under GISB, over 30 under Firm GTC.  If Firm master signed, all gas under Firm master.

Any questions, please call.

All:

	In follow-up to my previous note, enclosed is a revised version of the Gas Master.  I have caught some obvious glitches with some of your help, but your further thoughts would be appreciated.  Also, I am attaching a new marked version which you should be able to open.

Thanks, 

Jeff

Attached are the EOL Firm Gas GTC, EOL Firm Gas GTC with Collateral Support, and a redline of the two.  For those of you who reviewed the last version and provided comments, thank you.  Please take a fresh read as material changes were made to Force Majeure.  Any further comments, please advise.

   

Carol, will you please completely "fresh read" both of them as a check for me.  Thank you.

Please forward to me your final comments by early tomorrow, by e-mail, voice mail or call me at home or in the office (I will come in around 11 or so).

This is not going to work.  Do you want me to control the priority list like we used to do at Enron?  Please let me know.

Attached is the customer priority list.

This is intended to be the "pre-approved" list for companies to be ready on launch day and includes US and Canadian entities in gas and power.

I have most recently been told that individual legal names are not wanted in this list - only group names. If individual legal names are needed, let me know - I can provide the list that way as well.

Note that there are about 25 more names on this list than the list previously supplied to credit. It appears a number of Canadian companies some non-online companies were not included in the original list. This most recent list includes these names and provides an order of priority for them.

I will be sending another list later, which will identify the type of Master Agreement priority for each (ISDA, Physical Gas, Physical Power)

Dave

All:

	Attached you will find a clean and marked version of the Master Firm Gas Purchase/Sale Agreement.  Your thoughts would be appreciated as this is somewhat of a  departure from the previous approach.  I will continue to review as this was thown together fairly quickly and I have not had the opportunity to carefully put all the pieces together.

I attach the following:

1.	Online Firm Gas GTC for NETCO with credit support:

	 ; and

2.	Online Firm Gas GTC for NETCO without credit support:

	 .

As with all our forms, these have changes from the U.S. forms to reflect local laws, industry practice and contracting policies.

I also attach each of these forms as blacklined to the corresponding U.S. form:

	 	 

These new forms are in the new legal database that has been created for NETCO.

My next tasks will be to prepare the following, in the following order of priority:

1.	Online Financial GTC for NETCO with credit support;
2.	Online Financial GTC for NETCO without credit support;
3.	Online Firm Power GTC for NETCO with credit support;
4.	Online Firm Power GTC for NETCO without credit support; and
5.	Offline/Telephone forms of GTCs for each of these products.

We will then focus on updating our Master Agreements for gas, power and financial.

Regards,
Peter

The goal is to finalize the GTCs and all significant trading forms and receive UBS Warburg comments and sign-off by both legal and credit by the end of business on Friday.  To that end, Bryan Murtagh and Sanjev [Credit] are coming down to Houston tomorrow evening for meetings in EB 38C2 starting at 9:00 am on Thursday and 1:00 pm on Friday.  This timing is important in the overall rollout plan.  Peter Keohane is also coming to Houston for the meetings to make parallel changes to the Canadian forms.  

Generally, the plan is to finish the Financial GTCs, the ISDA Schedule and Collateral Support Agreement Paragraph 13 first on Thursday.  Next, we should go to the Physical Gas GTCs, the Enfolio Master and the Adoption Agreement.  Finally, we should proceed to the EEI Master and Collateral Annex.  Also, there should be a discussion of the WSPP and any other Western related issues.

On a separate track, all gas transportation and related gas agreements (most of which are non-negotiable) are being prepared by Suzanne Calcagno, Jeff Hodge, Gerald Nemec and Angela Davis.  These agreements will also require sign-off by legal and credit.  A discussion should be scheduled on Thursday or Friday.  On the power side, ERCOT issues should be discussed, but otherwise the discussion of transmission agreements etc. can wait until next week.  

Please identify all critical path issues to achieve the above-stated goal.  Thanks in advance for all the hard work!

Please advise.  Vickers had told me no "interruptible" in phase 1.  Please note long descriptions on certain firm gas products (constrained points) include an excuse of performance.  This may simply be a terminology issue.

It is currently owned by the Estate, but I assume (Anne, Mark or Mark?) that it would be assigned to NETCO as part of that transaction.  I should add that we will incur some legal expenses in filing applications in foreign jurisdictions (although probably not substantial).  Also, an additional benefit of delaying the filing for ten months is that the US Patent and Trademark Office will make an initial determination as to some elements of patentability (which they do not otherwise do) -- this would give us some indication of whether it is worthwhile pursuing the patent process.

With respect to prosecuting our business method patent application outside the U.S., we may now designate those non-U.S. countries in which we are seeking patent protection, or elect to postpone that process for an additional ten months.
 
If we wish to designate the appropriate countries now, we must file an application in each country in which we want patent protection on or before February 28, 2002.   If we elect to postpone the process, we must file an notice to that effect on or before January 30, 2002.  One benefit of taking the ten-month extension of the process is that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will review our patent application and issue a non-binding written opinion on whether our invention meets certain conditions (novelty, inventiveness, industrial applicability) that are required in order to be patentable.  
 
Please let me know whether we should designate countries now, or file for the extension.  It may be that we want to let the dust settle on the NETCO transaction before making this decision.

I just wanted to say thanks to all of you for your hard work in getting the documentation to the stage it is at today.  I know things have been very difficult but this is a huge step in moving us forward.  Unfortunately I do not see things getting much easier during our start-up months but I really do believe it will all be worth it and hopefully we'll have a lot of fun along the way.

The commercial team was extremely pleased to receive the documentation and has set off to deliver them to our new customers.

Thanks for your late and long hours.

Enclosed are clean and mark revised (hopefully close to final) drafts of the EEI Collateral Annex and Cover Sheet.  Most of the changes were made to add Securities as Eligible Collateral.  This has not yet been done on the Cover Sheet since it is in a special format that I couldn't figure out.  It will be done tomorrow.  Please call or e-mail me with any remaining comments as we need to finalize this as early as possible tomorrow.  Thanks.

An issue has been raised whether masters can be sent out prior to HSR approval.  There is not a problem with more general marketing.  We need to have a meeting with the marketers and the lawyers later in the week to come to conclusion on this issue.  This should not in any way slow down the work on the forms!

Attached are final forms of certain Power Trading documents:

1.  Master Agreement EEI (full blown), with all credit terms left blank, for negotiation with counterparties (CP);

2.  EEI Collateral Annex, including paragraph 10, for use with the Master Agreement EEI;

3.  GTC EEI, Online with credit terms (unilateral right to call for collateral at any time for any reason), for use as the default GTCs Online when dealing with CPs with whom there will be a credit requirement (but could also be used for trades entered into orally assuming we secure the CP consent to the form of agreement, including cover page, prior to entering into trade);

4.  GTC EEI, Online without  credit terms, for use as the default GTCs Online when dealing with CPs with whom there will not be a credit requirement (but could also be used for trades entered into orally assuming we secure the CP consent to the form of agreement, including cover page, prior to entering into trade).

While these documents have been discussed generally with UBS, UBS has not yet had an opportunity to review the actual final version.

100 copies of the first two documents (which will be combined as one for distribution) will be delivered by Genia to Dave shortly.

Please call with any questions/comments.

Enclosed are clean and mark revised (hopefully close to final) drafts of the EEI Collateral Annex and Cover Sheet.  Most of the changes were made to add Securities as Eligible Collateral.  This has not yet been done on the Cover Sheet since it is in a special format that I couldn't figure out.  It will be done tomorrow.  Please call or e-mail me with any remaining comments as we need to finalize this as early as possible tomorrow.  Thanks.

This is a completely new list and is different from the original list verbally signed off by Louise Kitchen on Tuesday.  This change will cause significant additional work prior to the Day 1 launch.  Please resend the list with counterparty legal names which are required for credit approvals and prioritization of contracts.  We will add the new names and begin to review them but I am not certain they are Day 1 priorites.   Many of the new names are non trading counterparties or power customers who I thought were not a Day 1 priority.  The list also is still missing the pipelines which will need to be approved Day 1.

We still need the list of priority contracts required to coordinate credit terms for Legal on Monday.  Please advise ASAP.

Attached is the customer priority list.

This is intended to be the "pre-approved" list for companies to be ready on launch day and includes US and Canadian entities in gas and power.

I have most recently been told that individual legal names are not wanted in this list - only group names. If individual legal names are needed, let me know - I can provide the list that way as well.

Note that there are about 25 more names on this list than the list previously supplied to credit. It appears a number of Canadian companies some non-online companies were not included in the original list. This most recent list includes these names and provides an order of priority for them.

I will be sending another list later, which will identify the type of Master Agreement priority for each (ISDA, Physical Gas, Physical Power)

I have given Mark Taylor my comments on the financial forms and he will be revising them.  I have met with Van Hooser and Hodge to discuss gas and have spoken with Bradford to get his perspective on gas.  We will be narrowing the menu of forms, revising in respect of certain terms, and studying possible construct changes to assist in credit matters.  Mark mentioned next Tuesday as a target which I will try to meet.  The EOL forms will be completed first.  Any questions, call me.

John and Sanjeev:
I am retransmitting the current drafts of the Power and Gas Collateral Annexes that we plan to use.  I am also sending the EEI Master that goes with the Power CSA.  the gas Master has not yet been prepared.  Once we sign off on the ISDA CSA, I plan to make conforming changes to these collateral annexes (mainly to address John's comments to the ISDA CSA) and also add as a form of collateral to each "securities".  Please let me know if any other changes need to be made.  Thanks.

Attached please find the GTCs for power (with and without credit).  Please note that we are actually using the EEI Master Agreement as the on-line contract, as opposed to the traditional GTCs.  We were actually in the process of making this transition on EOL this fall, and Kevin Presto and Tim Belden have endorsed Netco's use of the EEI on-line.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

With respect to prosecuting our business method patent application outside the U.S., we may now designate those non-U.S. countries in which we are seeking patent protection, or elect to postpone that process for an additional ten months.
 
If we wish to designate the appropriate countries now, we must file an application in each country in which we want patent protection on or before February 28, 2002.   If we elect to postpone the process, we must file an notice to that effect on or before January 30, 2002.  One benefit of taking the ten-month extension of the process is that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will review our patent application and issue a non-binding written opinion on whether our invention meets certain conditions (novelty, inventiveness, industrial applicability) that are required in order to be patentable.  
 
Please let me know whether we should designate countries now, or file for the extension.  It may be that we want to let the dust settle on the NETCO transaction before making this decision.

Subject: GTCs, Forms and Agreements


The goal is to finalize the GTCs and all significant trading forms and
receive UBS Warburg comments and sign-off by both legal and credit by
the end of business on Friday.  To that end, Bryan Murtagh and Sanjev
[Credit] are coming down to Houston tomorrow evening for meetings in EB
38C2 starting at 9:00 am on Thursday and 1:00 pm on Friday.  This
timing is important in the overall rollout plan.  Peter Keohane is also
coming to Houston for the meetings to make parallel changes to the
Canadian forms.

Generally, the plan is to finish the Financial GTCs, the ISDA Schedule
and Collateral Support Agreement Paragraph 13 first on Thursday.  Next,
we should go to the Physical Gas GTCs, the Enfolio Master and the
Adoption Agreement.  Finally, we should proceed to the EEI Master and
Collateral Annex.  Also, there should be a discussion of the WSPP and
any other Western related issues.

On a separate track, all gas transportation and related gas agreements
(most of which are non-negotiable) are being prepared by Suzanne
Calcagno, Jeff Hodge, Gerald Nemec and Angela Davis.  These agreements
will also require sign-off by legal and credit.  A discussion should be
scheduled on Thursday or Friday.  On the power side, ERCOT issues
should be discussed, but otherwise the discussion of transmission
agreements etc. can wait until next week.

Please identify all critical path issues to achieve the above-stated
goal.  Thanks in advance for all the hard work!

Attached are clean and marked copies of the online trading GTCs for physical power which I have generally discussed with Bryan Murtagh (UBS). You will note that we have elected to use the EEI form by incorporation as we believe this will be the most marketable approach understanding that different forms will be required for many players, eg WSPP.

I will be doing a final review over the weekend and expect this form to be final by Monday am.  If you have any questions/comments, please let me know.  

By copy of this email to Genia, I would ask for her help in cleaning up the document (sorry, beyond my current skills, hopefully, soon to be broadened) and would ask Leslie to carefully review and provide me any thoughts/comments.  Based upon this document, we will have ready by Monday pm, the long form EEI for regular negotiation.

thanks

Peter, Louise has requested a review of the various forms to be utilized in NETCO.  It is my current understanding that Canada trading will be included.   Therefore, we need you to review the Canadian physical forms.  I have mentioned the matter to Bradford, who will be calling you with Credit concerns and suggestions.

I have given Mark Taylor my comments on the financial forms and he will be revising them.  I have met with Van Hooser and Hodge to discuss gas and have spoken with Bradford to get his perspective on gas.  We will be narrowing the menu of forms, revising in respect of certain terms, and studying possible construct changes to assist in credit matters.  Mark mentioned next Tuesday as a target which I will try to meet.  The EOL forms will be completed first.  Any questions, call me.

All:

	Attached you will find a clean and marked version of the Master Firm Gas Purchase/Sale Agreement.  Your thoughts would be appreciated as this is somewhat of a  departure from the previous approach.  I will continue to review as this was thown together fairly quickly and I have not had the opportunity to carefully put all the pieces together.

Attached hereto are clean and marked copies of the current draft of the template Interim Master Terms Agreement (Financial). This is the form of adoption agreement that may be used where a counterparty prefers to "adopt " the terms of its prior Master with ENA  until such time as a definitive master agreement is entered into with UBS.  The marks indicate the changes made from the draft Mark Taylor sent around last Friday and reflects comments made by Bryan last week.  Please review and call with any comments.  

Jeff and Leslie, please adapt this form as needed to create templates for the gas and power masters.  

Thanks, Anne

Attached for review is the Gas Industry Standards Board Base Contract form, with revised Special Provisions.  This agreement is formatted as "preprinted" subject to customization via the Special Provisions.  I have generally utilized the GTC provisions to customize the Special Provisions.  This agreement is used for interruptible gas and firm gas for a delivery period no greater than 31 days.

Louise and mark:
I have gone as far as I can in drafting a Gas Collateral Annex for the Master Firm Gas Agreement which I understand Jeff Hodge is in the midst of creating.  Once the Gas Master is close to final, I can finalize the Collateral Annex.
