Updates for Today's NetCo regression test at 1:00pm:
=20
NT User Id's
For testing, if you are NT user id that participated in the 'PILOT' group, =
please use your PILOT id.
Otherwise, use the nc_t_xxxx accounts as previous testing.  The NT conversi=
on for all remaining NetCo is expected to take place tonight 02/04.
=20
Global Data
Below is my current understanding of the counterparties used for testing.  =
Contract setup is near complete and we will have the updates when deal entr=
y starts.
=20
1305 UBS Warburg Energy LLC acting as agent for UBS AG, London Branch
11266 UBS Canada Branch (name TBD)

    Storage Service Contract 20000059  (Agency Contract 20000062)=20
    Transportation Contract 20000057
=20
The goals of the test are:
1) regression test a subset of scenarios (ie Physical Gas Sale, Physical Po=
wer Supply, Financial Swap, Intercomapny) now that the Global Data is more =
stable (UBS internal counterparties, profit centers, desks/ books)=20
2) Identify any reference to internal/ external screens that still have 'EN=
RON' reference, or 'EOL' reference
3) Ensure we have the latest price curve data from updates (ie TAGG/ERMS)
4) process new EOL data created for Monday.  To verify mid/ back office, in=
cluding SAP processing.   EOL will also push data from a mock trading sessi=
on for on 2/7 (see below)=20
5) provide the test data scenarios for SAP testing (scheduled Tuesday 1pm).=
  SAP is completing their setup with the new controlling area for NetCo.=20
6) Continue with NT Logins involved with PILOT untill remaining are ported.

Please review the attached user test schedule; I've updated for the name sw=

Test Cases & Global Data
The attached spreadsheet has the current global data and on tab page 2, the=

The global staff is updating the counterparties now/ and contracts to redis=

I'm requesting for the deal entry users to please comment/ revise as to wha=
t specific test cases are needed, and can be omitted.
Unlike previous testing, we will be using real (active) counterparties, and=
 need to test intercompany scenarios (UBS London to UBS Canada).
We would like a subset for Power (ie 4), and a subset for Gas (6-8) that we=
 can perform during this time.

Can the respective Deal Entry groups discuss and send me your feedback toda=

Everyone,=20
=20
The attached document outlines the Netco testing schedule for Monday, Feb 4=
th & Tuesday, Feb 5th.  There have been many decisions/ setup changes from =
the last test, and the majority of global data is now known.  This is the l=
ast week to test and validate before go-live.   =20
=20
The goals of the test are:
1) regression test a subset of scenarios (ie Physical Gas Sale, Physical Po=

The NetCo terminal server ( <http://remoteservices.netco.enron.com>) will b=

We have test scripts for Houston scenarios, but need your participation to =
develop scenarios for your area (ie CAD dollar scenarios).

Your input is needed by Friday noon (ASAP):

ded for processing. =20
       Attachment Doc ' 0204 Global Data Setup requirements.doc' - developm=

The Bridgeline (800-711-8000 Code 3454709) will be open during the testing =

Thanks again for all your support.

FYI - The EOL business is planning a mock trading session tentatively sched=
uled for 2/7 (Thursday). The plan is to use the UBS production systems. The=
 traders will be using the EOL Stack Manager and their own real products. T=
he originators will be hitting the web site using valid counterparty accoun=
ts. It should last about 2 hours (probably 9am-11am).

That's for S (probably S3) but porting to R should be a breeze.

Good Morning,
We wanted to send out some clarification, minor changes, and to thank you again for your participation in the UBS Warburg Energy Pilot Migration, your feedback will greatly assist us in making the transition to the new environment as effective as possible. 
Unfortunately we are still awaiting information from our Corporate Legal staff regarding legally acceptable and appropriate procedures for moving data between the Estate (i.e. current Enron) data shares and UBS Warburg Energy data shares.
For this reason you are not authorized to copy any data from your Estate data shares (your Z:\ drive) following your migration until the formal communication from Legal has been communicated and a procedure for this has been provided. 
Until the formal procedure has been received from Legal and distributed to users, the O:\Estate\O drive, O:\Estate\M drive, P:\Estate\P drive (Portland users) and P:\Estate\I drive (Calgary users) data will not be available to migrated users.  We do expect this policy to be in place some time day or this weekend, which will alleviate these restrictions.
Please be aware that we may be advised to delete any data present on your new H:\ drives after the formal notification from Legal has been distributed.
We greatly apologize for the lack of forewarning regarding this information and apologize for any inconvenience caused. Please contact 3-1411 if any of this information is unclear. 
Thank you for your continued participation in the Migration effort.

Regards,

Dan Dietrich

You should be getting a call from Shaw Cable, today or tomorrow to arrange a
time with you to install the cable modem.
 FYI, I bought a used computer at Computer Outlet, and two months free
internet and installation came with the package.

Let me know if  you don't hear from shaw in the next day or so. Looks like
I'm going to be working downtown starting sometime this week, we should try
to get out for a coffee or bit to eat again.

Cheers, Greg

Cooper,  
 
Here is what we have planned so far. 
 
 
NACAL-POWERFS1
NACAL-SQWS001P
NACAL-SQWS001D
 
These servers are in use now and will stay with UBS
 
The three pixxa boxes will become Estate production servers. 
 
 
Thanks
 
Greg

Greg/Dan, 

now that things are firming up, can you give me a summary of what is happening to all of the servers purchased for trading decision support (i.e., fundamentals).  the ones i had to get zufferli to sign off on purchasing were power-fs1, nacal-sqws001p, nacal-sqws001d and the 3 pizza boxes.  i know there is some shuffling around now, but i'd like to know what the plan is for these in the short term and long term (either estate/ubs share, estate only, or ubs only). 

thanks, 
cooper

Do you have a strong interest in the applied statistics aspects of your field of specialty? Do you want to learn the following:
(1) The key concepts and model fitting methods of modern robust statistics,
(2) Automatic outlier detection ("data mining for outliers") with robust statistics,
(3) Selected hands-on computing exercises using the new S-PLUS Robust Library for robust statistical modeling and outlier detection.

If you answered yes to any of the above questions then this course is for you:


Dates:	March 18-19, 2002
City:	New York, NY
Course:	Robust Statistics and Data Mining for Outliers presented by Doug Martin
(full description: http://www.insightful.com/services/course.asp?CID=23)

This course will give you the ability to routinely carry out robust statistical model fitting and analysis based on basic robustness theory, and quickly compare the results with classical methods using highly informative visual displays.  The robust model fits will reveal the presence of outliers that have substantial distorting influence on the classical model fits, and whose existence are often not at all revealed by the classical fit.

Cooper,
 
As far as I know we will continue to use E-connect.  At some point we will actually split our networks from Estate, and I'd expect that UBS will have a change then.  I'm told that the split is a few months out.
 
Thanks, 
 
Greg

Cooper-- I have been looking at the chassis for the  model we need to develop. it looks like we can expand (piggy back) the model AE  uses for the Snow & water supply forecasts. They only have reports for March  thru to August i.e. the period of the bulk of the runoff from snow and rain. We  would have to add the remainder of the year as well as the power plants. Will  fax ou a sketch of my proposed basic layout.
I have done some checking of the data in the May  2001 report e.g. reservoir volumes and average flows. They use the same data  base as TAU it appears. There are still a number of items in their model we have  to understand. But I think if we have an uninteruppted afternoon with you and  your trusty computer we can at least identify the areas we need to discuss with  John Taggart the AE mastermind of the program.
Will check to see if you have or can get the  necessary access that would be required in the next day or so. Could you devote  a free afternoon next Tuesday or Wednesday?  Stan
Please advise.

Hey Cooper,
 
I would like to get your opinion and approval on a couple of things:
 
1) We'd like to get a development IIS server running, and so would also like to move your development from NETCo's only production IIS server, to this new server.  I believe Greg is setting this up shortly.
 
2) Since the PowerFS1 server is now the production web server for all of NETCo, we'd like to move the IIS administration duties to the IT team, which would most likely mean to me. (I'm assuming you have these duties right now?  If not, maybe you could point me in the right direction)
 
3) Also because of that, we need to move at least one web application on to PowerFS1.(Presenter is the one NETCo web app moving over that is in Production.  Origman will be there shortly as well.)  Since Pavel used MSXML3 with SP1 and would need it on the box, I was wondering what version are you running? (He tells me that multiple versions can be run at the same time, as they are separately named libraries and files).
 
Thanks for your time.
 
Let me know what you think about all of this,

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

Dave Forster

hi everone!
I'm trying to get a feel for who may be interested in a south lake tahoe ski
shindig. I looked into the place we rented 2 (?) years ago (when cooper flew
down from portland via reno on the snowiest day of the year) and it is
available as soon as March 8. Yeah, not that soon (maybe this will give the
sky a chance to bear snow). Between 12 people, 2 nights, a hottub,
fireplace, heavenly company, etc. it would cost about $40/person for the
weekend. Let me know what weekends on/after March 8 would work for you and
how many people including yourself may like to come.

let it snow let it snow let it snow!

I'm going over to ACTC partnership to install the PETE application. Only a
weeks work, but I'll make enough cash to maybe buy some of this networking
hardware. I'm going to check it out now.

Updates for Today's NetCo regression test at 1:00pm:
=20
NT User Id's
For testing, if you are NT user id that participated in the 'PILOT' group, =
please use your PILOT id.
Otherwise, use the nc_t_xxxx accounts as previous testing.  The NT conversi=
on for all remaining NetCo is expected to take place tonight 02/04.
=20
Global Data
Below is my current understanding of the counterparties used for testing.  =
Contract setup is near complete and we will have the updates when deal entr=
y starts.
=20
1305 UBS Warburg Energy LLC acting as agent for UBS AG, London Branch
11266 UBS Canada Branch (name TBD)
=20
54979 Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C.
64245 Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company
65268 Reliant Energy Services, Inc.
3015 Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.
    Storage Service Contract 20000059  (Agency Contract 20000062)=20
    Transportation Contract 20000057

=20
The goals of the test are:
1) regression test a subset of scenarios (ie Physical Gas Sale, Physical Po=
wer Supply, Financial Swap, Intercomapny) now that the Global Data is more =
stable (UBS internal counterparties, profit centers, desks/ books)=20
2) Identify any reference to internal/ external screens that still have 'EN=
RON' reference, or 'EOL' reference
3) Ensure we have the latest price curve data from updates (ie TAGG/ERMS)
4) process new EOL data created for Monday.  To verify mid/ back office, in=
cluding SAP processing.   EOL will also push data from a mock trading sessi=
on for on 2/7 (see below)=20
5) provide the test data scenarios for SAP testing (scheduled Tuesday 1pm).=
  SAP is completing their setup with the new controlling area for NetCo.=20
6) Continue with NT Logins involved with PILOT untill remaining are ported.

User Test Schedule
Please review the attached user test schedule; I've updated for the name sw=

The timeframe for SAP confirmation Tuesday 1pm, and I've moved Gas Settleme=

 pm.

Test Cases & Global Data
The attached spreadsheet has the current global data and on tab page 2, the=
 test cases.  We will still use the detailed test scenarios for entry.
The global staff is updating the counterparties now/ and contracts to redis=
tribute.
=20
I'm requesting for the deal entry users to please comment/ revise as to wha=
t specific test cases are needed, and can be omitted.
Unlike previous testing, we will be using real (active) counterparties, and=
 need to test intercompany scenarios (UBS London to UBS Canada).
We would like a subset for Power (ie 4), and a subset for Gas (6-8) that we=
 can perform during this time.

Can the respective Deal Entry groups discuss and send me your feedback toda=

Everyone,=20
=20
The attached document outlines the Netco testing schedule for Monday, Feb 4=
th & Tuesday, Feb 5th.  There have been many decisions/ setup changes from =
the last test, and the majority of global data is now known.  This is the l=
ast week to test and validate before go-live.   =20
=20
The goals of the test are:
1) regression test a subset of scenarios (ie Physical Gas Sale, Physical Po=
wer Supply, Financial Swap, Intercomapny) now that the Global Data is more =
stable (UBS internal counterparties, profit centers, desks/ books)=20
2) process new EOL data created for Monday.  To verify mid/ back office, in=

on for on 2/7 (see below)=20
3) provide the test data scenarios for SAP testing (scheduled Tuesday 1pm).=
  SAP is completing their setup with the new controlling area for NetCo.=20
4) pilot the (real) NetCo logins, and no longer the nc_t_xxxx logins.  As y=
ou recall, there can be start up menu issues with porting user ids.
=20
Canada/ Portland/ Toronto
The NetCo terminal server ( <http://remoteservices.netco.enron.com>) will b=
e available during this timeframe for your testing.  =20
We have test scripts for Houston scenarios, but need your participation to =
develop scenarios for your area (ie CAD dollar scenarios).
=20
Your input is needed by Friday noon (ASAP):
1) To confirm/ update the test participants on the attached schedule .  Ple=
ase reply with others that will be testing.=20
        Attachment Doc ' 0204 User_Test_ Schedule Netco.doc' -=20
=20
 2) Assist/ provide feedback with what global data setup is required.  Down=
time from previous testing was largely due global data missing that was nee=
ded for processing. =20
       Attachment Doc ' 0204 Global Data Setup requirements.doc' - developm=
ent in progress, update to be provided later today.
=20
The Bridgeline (800-711-8000 Code 3454709) will be open during the testing =
times. We request that all application owners be dialed into the bridgeline=
 to expedite the resolution of any issues that might come up.=20

Thanks again for all your support.

FYI - The EOL business is planning a mock trading session tentatively sched=
uled for 2/7 (Thursday). The plan is to use the UBS production systems. The=
 traders will be using the EOL Stack Manager and their own real products. T=
he originators will be hitting the web site using valid counterparty accoun=
ts. It should last about 2 hours (probably 9am-11am).

I think I'm going to be getting out of here in about 20 min.   I don't think Emmy's done till about 5:30 but I haven't heard from her all day.  Hopefully she's still up for it.  Have you heard from her at all?
Anyway, if you can't get a hold of her after your appointment, give my cell a call for a status check:  617-1858.

Subject:        RE: Friday Festivities 

try having no work to do for two months and then having to stick around and 
"appear" busy...  i know what you mean, in some ways its harder when you're 
not used to not doing things.  i've gotten good at finding things to do 
with my time, but when i first had nothing to do, i was going crazy. 
fridays are always slow around here and i'm guessing its the same there, 
although i don't know cnrl specifcally, oil and gas producer/marketer? 

in terms of what i do, before enron went under, i was the short term 
alberta power trader.  since then, i have been champion internet surfer and 
investigating local coffee shops in an ever-widening circle.  although, 
things are looking up. 

eze is (i think) an earls nickname -- pronounced easy-e.  although, they 
may just call her easy for short.  i'm sure she loves both names very much. 

i have a very important meeting at 5 with my massage therapist and i was 
thinking about stopping by after that.  should i call eze's cell?  or do 
you have a cell #?

   You know what the worst thing in the world is?  Having no work to do on 
   a Friday but being unable to leave for hours.  I've been here for three 
   months and this is the first day where I haven't been busy.  This is a 
   Type A's worst nightmare.  E-mail is my sole consolation. 
   So what do I do, you ask?  I'm in Gas Operations, the marketer's right 
   hand man.  I do logistics, volume and supply/demand analysis, 
   nominations, monitoring of accounts, damage control...you know, more or 
   less hold the company together.  What exactly do you do over there? 
   Everyone always sees Emmy at Banana Republic.  She's a staple there. 
   Where did you get eze from?  I'm sure she loves it.  She never gets very 
   flattering nick names. 
   Well, I'm going to take off for lunch.  What time were you thinking of 
   coming down for drinks? 
   Talk to you soon

     hmm, synapses not jumping - i know the feeling,  i think i have three 
     neurons firing in my brain this morning... 

     i know what you mean about getting soft - when i went home to virginia 
     for 
     christmas, my mom was like "it's cold out, shouldn't you put a jacket 
     on?" 
     and having been toughened by the brutal calgary winters (in addition 
     to 
     being the super tough guy that i am) i did go out --- naked almost 
     every 
     day. 

     let me know when you'er heading over to bass brothers and i'll meet up 
     with 
     you - i have a few things to do but drinks after work should fit in. 

     i ran into eze (aka emily) at banana republic last night - its such a 
     small 
     town! 

     hey, what do you do at cnrl anyway?

        Good morning Cooper! 
        I've been at work for almost an hour and the synapses are still 
     refusing 
        to jump.  So, a short e-mail break is needed. 
        No, I didn't wind up going to see Black Hawk Down.  My parents are 
     in 
        town from Kuwait so I've been spending time with them.  They've 
     gone 
        soft since going over to Kuwait.  I don't thing I've ever seen two 
        colder people in my life. 
        Of COURSE I know Ian Cooke.  I hear he sits right by you at work. 
        You'll have to tell him I say hi. 
        I don't think this weekend is going to be a very exciting one on my 
        part.  My dad's leaving on Sunday so I'll be doing the family thing 
     most 
        of the time.  Emmy said they're thinking of going to Bass Brothers 
        tomorrow and I think I'll try to go for a couple.  You coming? 
        Anyway, I should probably think about working.  Talk to you soon.

Hey Cooper, 
What a great idea! Eze sounds much better than Emily.  I hope it's not to late to change my business cards.  "Eze the auditor" has a nice ring to it. 
Sounds like moving was a good time.  The worst part about moving is having to deal with the stuff still in boxes that you haven't unpacked from your previous move.  Most people throw it away,  but not me.  I, for some reason,  feel like I might need it someday,  yet I have no idea what I have in these mystery boxes.  I'm sure your movers loved the obstacle course to get to your place.  They probably thought it was some kind of joke.  Thanks for the moving stories,  they were entertaining.  I have a visual of your building manager...pure comedy!  So when are you guys having the big house warming/  hot tub party?  It would be a good chance to cash in on some more scooby doo paraphenelia and house warming gifts.  Speaking of Scooby doo,  I'm sure Jai is loving the scooby phone.  I can see him not answering it until after a couple rings just so he can get the whole show. 
How is the whole work out regime coming along??  It sounds like you have a balance in your life.  Work is going well,  because you get to trade again, and your working out.  How does it feel?  I am all about balance in life.  Although it might not seem like it from the little free time I have,  I have a balance. I'm going for runs at all hours of the late night/ early morning....just to keep things intersting!
I'm going to look into wine fest,  and I'll let you know.  Jill and I are trying to get some people together to paint pottery in the evening next week.  We thought it would be a good alternative to going for drinks.  That way we can grab coffee (preferably, from Starbucks) and chill while we creat masterpieces. Anyone who wants to come is welcome.  Doesn't that sound like fun?  I'm already looking foward to it!  I was thinking Tuesday?  You and Jai could make something for your new place!
I leave you with that.....and before I forget,  guess who's buying baby blue pants from banana this week?  We'll be super fly cool cats!!!
eze 
PS - where's my clip art you promised??  Jill isn't at work this week,  so I'm not getting any interesting e-mails from her.

I put in a call to the deloitte systems admin to have your email name 
changed to "Purtzki, Eze".  I hope you don't mind. 
I'm tired from moving.  Enron's moved me in the past and I'm used to just 
pointing and saying "that will go over there", etc.  and i spent all sunday 
night packing up my shit.  ugh.  most of it has been moved which is good. 
i don't think you've ever seen my loft, but to get to it, you have to take 
the elevator up one building and then walk across the roof of another 
building (picture gravel with flagstones that are spaced for janice to walk 
across) and then into the floor of my building.  once the movers saw this, 
I think they almost quit!  it was bad, but they did a great job.  I told 
one of them, "the building i'm moving into will be a breeze compared to 
this one" and he laughed and said "of course, you have the worst apartment 
i've ever moved".  poor guy.  that's the most entertaining tidbit i could 
come up with. 
you should meet the building manager in our new building.  he's a freak, 
but in a professional way.  he's already yelled at jai and i.  he sounds 
russian and says in a thick accent "if you vant to leeve here, you haf to 
obey da rrrulesss".  i hope you read that with a russian accent in your 
head.  he has video cameras set up that feed into his kitchen!  his wife is 
a piece of work as well. 
count me in for the wine fest.  if you pick up some tix, grab me one, or 
let me know where the website is, etc. 
i can't believe you've moved on from tubulars.  while tubulars does seem 
like the next big thing, oil and gas seems like a promising area to study.

Whilst Tindall & Foster  (Enron's Legal Immigration Counsel) will be able to forward most of this required documentation, it would assist with expediting matters if you are able to forward me this information.   My desk location is 3681c.
 
For those of you who have signed the release forms  (copy attached) your details on file  with Tindall & Foster will be forwarded to Fragomen (UBS Immigration  Counsel) shortly.
 
Please utilize me as your contact at this point and not the contact names on the checklist until/unless otherwise notified .
 
Kind Rgds,

To continue getting familiar with Ontario, please review the document OEFC_demandSupp_UBS.ppt on your I:/common/OEFC directory.  It is a presentation we gave to OEFC in the fall.

Here is a spreadsheet with additional information.
 
Some intertie information may vary from source to source.  This is due to the IMO's regular small adjustments to the capacity numbers.

Hi Cooper!

Greetings from NYC, where instead of exploring this
fabulous city, I sit and write cover letters in my mad
dash to get some kind of work...you may be, if not now
soon, in the same position, no?  It is hard to tell
from all the news reports what is like for Enron
employees who have NOT been let go.  I squandered my
savings/reasonable vacation time visiting and helping
my sister with her new baby girl Lindsey in November.
Never before has such an exquisite, vivacious and
clever child lived!

I had no idea that you lived in Calgary. It is such a
beautiful area, as I remember from the one trip there
I took with my family when I was in high school. I
remember especially canoing on a torquoise (sp?) lake
in Banff ( our safety orange life jackets made a
splendid contrast to the water)  and clambering over
dazzling glaciers, later to learn that such activity
is not so safe. I have a friend who live in SF now but
is Quebequois, and wishes to know if you are looking
for friends/ girlfriend. If so, I imagine she has a
long list of buddies in your neck of the woods.

Make Ben respectable? That's quite a project. We are
in fact engaged to marry, and have been since April,
but can't seem to get motivated to plan the actual
event. I'm not much of a girl it seems when it comes
to bridal finery and preparations.

In an odd chance assembly of swatties a few weeks ago
I saw both Jeff Sugg and Nate Reed.  They both seem
not a day changed. Jeff was properly tired from his
theater job, and proceded to get baked and Nate was
enthusiastic to the point of being a bit frenetic.
Shades of Fell Street.

I'm off to yoga class now, the only thing that keeps
me from regressing into a fetal position when looking
for a job.
hope you are healthy and happy.
love elissa

Cooper,

I hope your move on the weekend went well. How are you liking the new digs?

I read the "Powers report" on Enron on the weekend... basically just
checking for my name.... didn't find it. One of the highlights was the fact
that, in one of the many deals with the partnerships, Enron actually bought
put options on Enron stock.

I hope things go well at UBS. My number is 213-6004. I'll probably give you
a shout re: poker sometime in Feb (not sure when, though)

Bill

Jen, 
my flight gets into Oakland at 11 p.m. on Thursday night; we could meet up for drinks... somewhere. in the city or EBay, depending upon who else wants to join in the festivities, I guess. i gotta rise and shine early on Friday morn', tho. 
Tues. morning is also an option -- just prob. more difficult, unless you wanna play hookey from work, and we could meet at Abir's for coffee. 
any other takers for drinks on Feb. 14th ? come on, there must be some lonely hearts out thar'  :-)

Welcome to the UBS Warburg Energy (UBSWE) Data Migration Pilot! We appreciate your acceptance of our request to be a member of the pilot and want to make you aware of some initial changes that will be in effect when you log into the new environment.

You will need to log off of your computer, and back in, to receive the changes that have been made. 

When you logon to your computer, you will use your Enron NT account and password, you will immediately be prompted to change your password (following Enron "password rules")

Once you've changed your password and logged off again you will see the UBSWE splash screen which contains the legal disclaimer for using an UBSWE system (this is similar to the Enron splash screen).

What won't "change"?
Your desktop will look very much the same as it always has
Your email will not be affected

What will "change"?
Your drive mappings to your home and common drives will have changed when you're in the new environment. This will be done automatically, but you should be aware of the following:

When you're in the new environment your H:\ drive will contain some UBSWE data, but will not contain your personal data .... (don't worry!) you will find the contents of your Estate H:\ drive in your UBSWE Z:\ drive.
When you are in the new environment your O:\drive will contain some UBSWE data AND it will contain a directory named M:\Estate and O:\estate which contains links back to all of your M:\and O:\ drive data through the M:\ and O:\ Drive folders
When you are in the new environment your P:\ drive (new local common directory) will contain some USBWE data AND it will contain a directory named P:\Estate which contains a link back to all of your legacy local common (i:\ drive for Calgary users) data through the designated folders.
When you are in the new environment you WILL have access to the applications that you use but these are UBSWE, but  you WILL NOT have access back to the Estate applications. 
	
If you need access to the Estate applications, please contact your local IT support. They will have an "est_" account, with your legacy access rights. Please keep in mind that your "est_" account will only be valid until UBSWE Day 1, and you will have to request an extension of these rights should you need them beyond that date.

If you have any questions, please contact your local IT support team.

If you have specific questions regarding the pilot, please contact me at the numbers listed below. 

Again, we appreciate your assistance in making the UBSWE transition a success!

 
Regards,

Dan Dietrich

Yes, we made it to Bolivia --finally!  All's well, although we're a little sleepy.  Cameron basically slept on the flight from Miami to La Paz.  Hope everyone is doing fine.  We're in a 4-star hotel with 2 bedrooms and 2 full baths and a stocked kitchen.  I'm emailing you from the embassy.  We are "in processing" today.  La Paz is beautiful.  We're still on our Diamox and doing fine.  We miss and love you all!  We have access to a computer at our hotel (Casa Grande) so I hope to be able to email you regularly.  We're going househunting soon!!

Camille, Mike & Cameron

You know what the worst thing in the world is?  Having no work to do on a Friday but being unable to leave for hours.  I've been here for three months and this is the first day where I haven't been busy.  This is a Type A's worst nightmare.  E-mail is my sole consolation.
So what do I do, you ask?  I'm in Gas Operations, the marketer's right hand man.  I do logistics, volume and supply/demand analysis, nominations, monitoring of accounts, damage control...you know, more or less hold the company together.  What exactly do you do over there?
Everyone always sees Emmy at Banana Republic.  She's a staple there.  Where did you get eze from?  I'm sure she loves it.  She never gets very flattering nick names.
Well, I'm going to take off for lunch.  What time were you thinking of coming down for drinks? 
Talk to you soon 
Jill

hmm, synapses not jumping - i know the feeling,  i think i have three 
neurons firing in my brain this morning... 

i know what you mean about getting soft - when i went home to virginia for 
christmas, my mom was like "it's cold out, shouldn't you put a jacket on?" 
and having been toughened by the brutal calgary winters (in addition to 
being the super tough guy that i am) i did go out --- naked almost every 
day. 

let me know when you'er heading over to bass brothers and i'll meet up with 
you - i have a few things to do but drinks after work should fit in. 

i ran into eze (aka emily) at banana republic last night - its such a small 
town! 

hey, what do you do at cnrl anyway?

   Good morning Cooper! 
   I've been at work for almost an hour and the synapses are still refusing 
   to jump.  So, a short e-mail break is needed. 
   No, I didn't wind up going to see Black Hawk Down.  My parents are in 
   town from Kuwait so I've been spending time with them.  They've gone 
   soft since going over to Kuwait.  I don't thing I've ever seen two 
   colder people in my life. 
   Of COURSE I know Ian Cooke.  I hear he sits right by you at work. 
   You'll have to tell him I say hi. 
   I don't think this weekend is going to be a very exciting one on my 
   part.  My dad's leaving on Sunday so I'll be doing the family thing most 
   of the time.  Emmy said they're thinking of going to Bass Brothers 
   tomorrow and I think I'll try to go for a couple.  You coming? 
   Anyway, I should probably think about working.  Talk to you soon. 
   Jill

With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


UBSWenergy Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).		

Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power
Jennifer McQuade (53614) - Power

It appears that the following email may not have been clear.  You have to copy all documents yourself.

This is my cheat sheet if it helps:  

H Drives:
1.  Each person will have to move any data over personally from the old H drive (which is now Z:) drive to their new H drive.  
2. The Z: drive (old H:) will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

O Drives:
1. For the old O or M drives go to O:\ESTATE\ O (or M ? pending location of data) and copy to the new common O.  The Estate O and M will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

Do not delete anything and only copy information which is complies with the policy.  Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply.

Attention: Portland & Calgary-based Outlook Users

The Global Messaging Team is proud to announce that Portland &
Calgary-based Enron employees that have been migrated to Outlook will now
be able to securely access their Enron Email from anywhere on the web. This
means that if you can get on to the Internet, you can access your Enron
Email with Outlook Web Access (OWA) without having to dial in to Enron's
network. Please note that this is not available to those users still on
Lotus Notes but will be available once they are migrated to Outlook.


Once on the Internet, type mail.enron.com in your browser address window
and supply your Enron network logon credentials as username and password.
For example:


  Username: jdoe4


  Password: ********


Once you log in, Outlook Web Access opens your Enron Email mailbox. Outlook
Web Access (OWA) allows you to send and receive mail, perform calendar
tasks and manage your mail and contacts, as well as access your mailbox
folders. At this time, Public Folders are not accessible via OWA.  Please
keep in mind that Outlook Web Access is a browser-based version of what you
might use in the office, so the functionality may be slightly different and
some features of Outlook 2000 may not be available at all. Additionally,
OWA is only supported using Internet Explorer 5.x only and not supported
with Netscape.


Outlook Web Access is the standard Email package for connecting to your
Enron mail from home, whether you are using an Enron-issued home PC, an
Internet connection with your personal home PC, or your ClickAtHome PC. We
will not support the use of the full Outlook installation for home use.


Outlook Web Access for some remote locations and European/APAC Enron sites
is currently being addressed and will be available soon. At this time, OWA
is only available if your mailbox resides on a Houston, Portland or Calgary
mail server.


If you have any questions, please contact your local IT support.

Chris, Richey:

Please look over the IHS data services price list, and let me know what service you will need.  They have put us in a Peer Group 7 so the prices are less then they were previously.

Thank you,

I don't see them but I don't have Corel installed on my computer.  It would probably work in a company who installs more software in their computers than just bare bones.  They even bought systems without cd-roms to serve a dual purpose:  1) lower costs and 2) minimize those pesky disractions so you can focus all your attention on your work.

Barbara,

Attached for your convenience in forwarding material to Jon Koomey at LBNL
are two summary documents describing Optimal and its electric power
solutions, the Final Report on CEC-LBNL-Cal ISO Aempfast Technology
Evaluation Project, and two press releases.

I recommend you also encourage Jon to visit the Optimal web site at
www.otii.com, and to look at materials posted there (e.g., the speech to the
Commonwealth Club.

Thanks!

Cheers,

Rich

Cooper:

My efforts to install the precompiled version of Freeciv on sunone are stalled, but the Windows-only version seems to work well too. The Sun probably is more capable of standalone, unattended operation, but I don't want to build the whole package from source. Yet.

All versions of network Civilization are at www.freeciv.org. Download the precompiled binaries, unpack to the directory of your choice, and launch the executables. If you want to play by yourself, you have to launch the server and then the client. To play with others, you can run the server on any machine, with all others requiring only the client. There are also the metaservers, although server loads vary widely by time of day and week.

I've been running the server on my notebook at 172.17.172.131, but I'm not sure how to set the server to automatically admit new players while a game's in progress. I know that it can be done, because the metaservers are usually configured that way.

Let me know when you've got things installed.

Everyone,

We are in the process of creating new contracts with UBS for all Market Data real-time applications, subscriptions and publications.  Attached is a comprehensive list of all contracts that will be renegotiated under the UBS name for use by the Gas and Power trading entities.  

In order to leverage UBS' significant discounts and avoid duplicate efforts, Danielle Marcinkowski with Market Data will be the initial point of contact when inquiring about the addition or status of applications or publications.  I bring this to your attention because we understand that several groups have initiated discussions with the various vendors over the past few days.  

If you have any questions please feel free to contact me at 713-853-9358 or Danielle at 713-853-7926.  If you think something is missing from the list, please bring it to our attention immediately.  Please pass this word around within your group as appropriate.

Regards,

Chris Behney

Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, "live" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market "News" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. "storm in the gulf").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

Regards,
UBSWenergy.com

Just wanted to check in.  I just talked with Tim, and he seemed to be holding up ok,
in spite of it all.  I hope that you guys are able to salvage something out of all this.

Keep me posted.  Not sure what's next for you, but I'd be happy to talk with you about career options
whenever is convenient.  I'll be in NY next week and the week after, and would be happy
to catch up then.  My mom's phone number is 631 549 9254.
Talk to you soon!

but I did get a game in yesterday but late and I had to go to the police gym

I said I would keep you in the loop on cost with these publications.  Please review the PIRA cost structure and let me know if you will be interested and the amount of users for this publication.  Note price increases for each site.

Dear Danielle,

It was a pleasure talking with you today.  PIRA would be delighted to
restart the relationship it has had with Enron over the course of the last
decade.  As a first step, I have attached an excel file presenting PIRA's
site license pricing matrix, which provides the fees for PIRA's Retainer
Services (oil, gas, electricity), based on different levels of usage.

I have also attached a document listing all of our energy service offerings
and studies, along with the corresponding fees, for you to review.

Please contact me if you have any questions.  I look forward to talking with
you further.

Regards,

Jeff Steele

Julianne, 

Please address Cooper's questions, or forward to the Calgary office.  He's responsible for his own CN tax & has had est CN withholdings from his paychecks (not hypo).

Thanks,

Hi,

I'm responding to an email sent by Tim Callahan on Nov 30 regarding questions on tax equalization.  I also left a voice-message for you.  

I'm in the Calgary office and paid out of the U.S.  I've been operating under the assumption that i 
wouldn't get hit twice on income taxes as there is a "credit" between Canada and the U.S.  However, after doing some reasearch on the IRS website, it seems there may be a cap to the "credit" that is allowable.  Do you know anything about this? or can you point me to someone who might be knowledgeable in such matters?  

thanks,
Cooper Richey

If you are participating in the Bowl Pool, copies of the pool can be picked up in front of the trading reception desk.  

Good Luck!

Dear Enron Assignee,

As Enron Global Employee Services has previously indicated, arrangements
have been made with PricewaterhouseCoopers to continue expat/inpat tax
services for the 2000 and 2001 tax years.

As contact information may be changing over the next few months, please be
sure to provide the updated information to PwC.  We will be distributing
2001 tax data organizers via email and will require an active email
address.

Note - This applies only to assignees who receive tax preparation
assistance as part of the expat/inpat contract.  If you have questions on
authorization status, please contact your HR rep.

Please send you updated contact information to
enron.houston.ias@us.pwcglobal.com

Kind Regards,

The PwC Enron Team
