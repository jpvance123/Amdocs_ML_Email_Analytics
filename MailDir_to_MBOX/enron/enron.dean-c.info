Women Get Top Recruit
The Longhorn women got a commitment Sunday from Tamra Cobbins, a 5-5 combo
guard at Kansas City Schlagle High School.
She chose the Longhorns over Kansas at the end after being recruited by top
schools all over the country.
She is lightning quick, and like the Longhorns' other early guard pledge, 5-7
Nina Norman of Jersey Village, has the passing and ball handling skills to
play the point and the scoring ability to play shooting guard.
The Longhorns also will get visits this weekend from  a top center, Sabrina
Keys, 6-2, of Berkeley, Cal., who has narrowed her choices to UT and Purdue,
and from the nation's top junior prospect, 6-3 center Tiffany Jackson of
Dallas Lincoln.
Keys is a top rebounder who loves crashing the boards. In fact, she said the
reason she isn't considering any Pac 10 schools is  officials in that league
"call too many picky fouls. In the Big 10 and Big 12, they let you play."
The junior class of girls is one of the best in Texas high school history
with lots of top talent, headed by Jackson, 6-5 Kalee Carey of Canyon, 6-0
Emily Niemann of Houston Westbury Christian and 6-2 lefthander Destiny Drew
of Crosby.
Carey's father is a graduate of the UT law school and both Niemann's parents
are Texas' graduates. Both are considering Texas, but both are wide open at
this point.
Carey's AAU team, the West Texas Star Hawks, won the national AAU
16-and-under championship during the summer. She averaged 19 points, 11
rebounds and 8 blocks during the national tourney.
The Star Hawks also defeated a highly touted California team three times in
three meetings. The California team had three Tennessee signees on it.
Niemann averaged 20.1 points, 10.1 rebounds and 2.6 blocks shots last year at
Westbury Christian. She is an outstanding all-around player.

Longhorns Get Pledge from Euless Trinity Defensive Back

Braden Johnson, 6-2, 200, 4.4, a defensive back from Euless Trinity who
came
to one of Texas' three-day summer camps earlier this month, committed to
the
Longhorns Wednesday.
Johnson, a hard-hitting safety who had 42 tackles last season for the 9-2
Trojans, who had one of the top defenses in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, is
moving to quarterback this season.
His father, David, told me his son decided to commit to the Longhorns
because
"the Texas coaches really impressed him with their coaching methods and
with
the classy way they operate. They were very open and very straightforward."
David Johnson said his son also attended a TCU camp this summer and went to
a
Texas A&M camp last summer. He said several schools called his son in May,
the month the NCAA allows schools to make one phone call to each recruit.
He
said calls came from coaches at Notre Dame, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Arkansas,
TCU
and others, but he said his son decided to commit to Texas and get the
recruiting process behind him so he could concentrate on his senior season.
Braden Johnson has strong athletic blood lines. David Johnson was on a
football scholarship at Oklahoma State when he suffered a career-ending
shoulder injury and David has two famous uncles for old-time football fans.
One is Bill Johnson, who had a 20-year career as a player and coach with
the
San Francisco 49ers and who also coached with Paul Brown on the Cleveland
Browns' staff. The other is Gil Johnson, the quarterback on the great SMU
teams that featured Doak Walker and Kyle Rote.
Braden Johnson is a three-sport star. He plays centerfield in baseball and
runs on the 400-meter relay in track. He also is a good student.
Johnson is the fifth high school star to commit to Texas this month. The
others are WR-DB Brian Carter of The Woodlands, and OLs Jonathan Scott of
Dallas Carter, Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village and Will Allen of
Houston Cypress Falls. In addition, Alfio Randall, a super OL recruit a
year
ago, is on track to graduate from Blinn JC in December and he told me he
will
enroll at Texas in January.
All five of the high school prospects who committed did so after attending
one of the Longhorns' summer camps.
Scott and Robinson are on virtually all of the national top 100 lists.
RECRUITING NOTES: The top running back and the top quarterback  in Texas
both
say they would like to commit early and the Longhorns are in strong
contention for both. The RB is Cedric Benson of Midland Lee, who rushed for
3,526 yards and 51 touchdowns in leading Lee to a 16-0 season and it's
second
straight Class 5A state championships. Both those incredible totals are
Class
5A records. The QB is Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch, who threw for
2,500 yards as a sophomore before suffering a broken collarbone last season
that knocked him out of his teams' final five games. He still passed for
1,170 yards. . . The Longhorns already have commitments from two of the 24
members of the "Super Team" in Dave Campbell's Texas Football Magazine.
They
are Scott and Robinson. The only other member of the "Super Team" who has
committed is Madisonville RB David Underwood, the Aggies' No. 1 RB target
who
announced last week that he is going to be a Michigan Wolverine. Allen made
the second team and Carter made the third team. . . There are at least five
super players I have seen who will be big recruiting targets next year.
That's right ? they were so good as sophomores that every school in the
country already knows about them. They are QB Vincent Young, 6-5, 195, 4.5,
of Houston Madison; RB Selvin Young, 5-11, 188, 4.4, of Houston Jersey
Village; DL Marco Martin, 6-4, 290, 4.7, of Mesquite; DE Travis Leitko,
6-5,
250, 4.7, of The Woodlands, and TE-OL Eric Winston, 6-6, 265, 5.0, of
Midland
Lee. Young ran for 2,204 yards last year in a tough district. Young threw
for
1,007 yards and ran for 730 more as a sophomore, also in a tough league.
Martin is so agile that he also plays fullback and so quick that he's a
terrific pass rusher and run stopper. Leitko was a dominating force as a
sophomore last year on The Woodlands' playoff team. Winston is a great
athlete who was one of the stars on Lee's title team as a sophomore. Leitko
and Young came to Texas' summer camp earlier this month.
In the "did-you-know" department: Nebraska was 81-8 in the last seven
football seasons. That makes the Huskers 80-5 against the rest of the world
during that span, but only 1-3 against our Longhorns.

Thank you baby!  You're so sweet!

I just got to school.  I'm gonna study until test time.  I'm also going
to call a few day spa places and set up an appointment for my mom for
mother's day.

I can't believe it's Friday!  The days are all mixed up for me.  Last
week was so wonderful with you.  It feels like I was on a long
vacation.  It was weird taking a shower in my own shower again and going
to sleep in my own bed.

Anyway, have a good day at work.  If I get bored studying, I'll email
you again!

Love you,
Jenn

Longhorns Mangle Aggies, 43-17, with Huge Third Quarter; Await Word on Bowl
Matchup

After a listless offensive performance in the first half, the Longhorns
romped and stomped in the third quarter and wrecked the Aggies "Wrecking
Crew" defense en route to a 43-17 victory Friday in Austin.
The Longhorns had 492 offensive yards and averaged a whopping 8.3 yards per
play. But there was a huge difference in the way the Longhorns played to
start both halves.
Texas ran only 9 plays for just 13 yards in the first quarter, an average o=
f
just under 1.5 yards per play. The Longhorns ran 18 plays for 303 yards in
the third quarter, an average of 16.8 yards per snap.
If not for safety Greg Brown's 10-yard scoring jaunt with an interception o=
f
a Mark Farris' pass on the Aggies' first offensive play, the Longhorns
probably would have trailed at the half.
But that quick touchdown and an overall outstanding half by the Texas defen=
se
allowed the Horns to go in at intermission with a 10-7 lead.
Everything changed in the third quarter. Chris Simms, starting because of a
knee injury to regular QB Major Applewhite, had been throwing east and west
for most of the first half.
But he came out throwing north and south to in the second half  and it
resulted in four touchdowns and 27 points in the third quarter to enable th=
e
Longhorns to put the game out of reach.
Simms hit 16 of 24 passes for 383 yards and three touchdowns, and he was a
perfect 8-for-8 for 233 yards in that pivotal third quarter.
Simms is just a sophomore and he was throwing primarily to those three
tremendous true freshmen all day, and particularly in the third quarter.
B. J. Johnson, Roy Williams and Sloan Thomas combined for 12 catches for 34=
6
yards and 3 TDs. The Horns also scored on their first two possessions in th=
e
fourth quarter, making them 6-for-6 on finishing drives to start the second
half.
The Longhorns won their final six games after a rocky 3-2 start, and they
will land in a major bowl (see page 5 for more on the bowl picture).
Here, briefly, is how the game went:
FIRST QUARTER
Victor Ike ran the kickoff back to the 34, but the Horns went three and out=
.
Kris Stockton hammered a great punt that died at the Aggie 9. On the Aggies=
'
first play, QB Mark Farris threw into the left flat and Texas' safety Greg
Brown picked
it off and strolled into the end zone for a TD. Stockton's kick made it 7-0
with 12:46 left. But the Longhorn offense failed to make a single first dow=
n
in the quarter. The Aggies made only three first downs, but they came late =
in
the quarter and got the Ags to the Texas 22 as the quarter ended. Texas had
only nine plays and 13 total yards in the quarter. The Aggies had 18 plays
for 40 yards.
SECOND QUARTER
Aggie TB Richard Whitaker completed the drive when he broke off tackle and
scored from the 15 on third-and-10 for a 7-7 tie with 13:17 left. A short
kickoff gave Texas the ball at the UT 43. On the second play, Simms found
freshman WR B. J. Johnson coming across for 32 yards to the Aggie 23. On th=
e
next play, Simms hit Johnson again for an apparent touchdown, but a rare
offensive pass interference penalty on Johnson negated it. The penalty set =
UT
back to the 33. Simms connected with TB Hodges Mitchell on an inside screen
to the A&M 17, but that was short of a first down because of the penalty.
Stockton's 34-yard field goal put UT ack on top, 10-7, with 10:43 left. The
Aggies got a 20-yard pass from Farris to WR Chris Taylor and 27 and 10-yard
runs by 260-pound RB Ja'Mar Toombs to get to the Texas 10. But Farris was h=
it
hard by DT Casey Hampton on an option and fumbled, with UT LB Tyrone Jones
recovering at the 9. Simms was sacked at the 3. Then the Horns were penaliz=
ed
half the distance for illegal procedure. On second-and-17, Simms threw long
for freshman WR Roy Williams, who made a miraculous catch on his fingertips
at the 42. Mitchell picked up two first downs with tough, tackle-breaking
runs to get the A&M 37 with just under a minute left in the half. But Simms
was sacked twice in a row to take the team out of field goal range as the
half ended.
THIRD QUARTER
The Aggies took the wind, allowing Texas to receive to start both halves. I=
t
worked in the first half, but it backfired big time in the third quarter. I=
ke
ran the kickooff back to the 29. Mitchell ran for 6 and 7 for a first down =
at
the 42. Simms hit a wide-open Johnson for 18 more to the Aggie 40. That mad=
e
it Roy Williams' time. The freshman phenom lined up wide left, came back on=
 a
reverse and galloped 40 yards for the first UT offensive touchdown.
Stockton's kick gave Texas a 17-7 lead with 13:42 left. The Aggies couldn't
move and Texas, starting from its own 18, went 82 yards for a touchdown to =
go
on top, 24-7, with 7:32 left. The big plays were a 35-yard pass from Simms =
to
Johnson and than a 20-yard touchdown pass to Williams. But the Aggies came
back immediately, with Farris hitting WR Mickey Jones behind UT CB Roderick
Babers for 56 yards and a TD. The kick cut Texas' lead to 24-14 with 5:49
left.  Ivan Williams ran the kickoff back to the UT 44. A holding penalty
pushed the Horns back to the 34. Simms hit Williams for 10 yards, than
connected with the Longhorns' third true freshman WR, Sloan Thomas, on the
sideline and he broke a tackle and galloped 55 yards for another TD.
Stockton's kick gave Texas a 31-14 lead with 4:43 left. The Aggies drove de=
ep
into UT territory again, but had to settle for a 40-yard field goal to cut
the deficit to 31-17 with 2:18 left. Starting from the 25, the Longhorns dr=
ew
a holding penalty to the 15, but Simms hit Williams for 15 to the 30, then
pump faked, allowing Johnson to break open and run under his long pass and
run untouched intothe end zone to complete a 70-yard scoring play. Stockton=
's
kick was blocked, but UT still had a 37-17 lead with 0:41 seconds left.
Longhorn CB Quentin Jammer intercepted Farris' pass at the Texas 48 on the
final play of the quarter. Simms was 8 for 8 for 234 yards and three TDs - =
to
three different true freshman wide receivers.
FOURTH QUARTER
After Jammer's interception, Simms hit Johnson again for 31 yards to set up=
 a
31-yard Stockton field goal and a 40-17 lead with 12:30 left. UT CB Ahmad
Brooks forced a fumble on  the third play after the kickoff, with Babers
recovering at the A&M 33, setting up a 30-yard field goal by Stockton to
complete the scoring at 43-17 with 9:33 left. A&M drove to the Texas 8 in t=
he
final minute of the game, but Farris' third-and-fourth-down passes fell
incomplete.

Longhorn Notes . .

* The Longhorns racked up 303 of their 492 yards total offense that torrid
27-point third quarter, and sophomore QB Chris Simms and true freshman WRs =
B.
J. Johnson, Roy Williams and Sloan Thomas accounted for 274 yards of it.
Simms completed 8 of 8 passes for 234 yards, and Johnson grabbed three of
them for 123 yards and a touchdown, Thomas caught one for 55 yards and a TD
and Williams had three catches for 45 yards and a touchdown. Williams also
went 40 yards to score on an end around.
* Texas is one of only eight teams to win at least nine games during each o=
f
the last three seasons. The others are Florida State, Florida, Miami,
Nebraska, Kansas State, Tennessee and Virginia Tech. The last time Texas ha=
d
three consecutive nine-win seasons was from 1981 through 1983.

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday he is "really excited about the way we finishe=
d
the season with six straight wins in three road games and three home games.=
"
He said the Big 12 "is so hard, with four teams in the top 10 in the Sagari=
n
ratings (Oklahoma, Kansas State, Nebraska and Texas), and a lot of other ve=
ry
good teams."
"A lot of people gave up on this team," he said after the game Saturday.
"They played like a top 10 team today. I'm very proud of them."
"Our freshmen receivers are unbelievable," he said. "They really helped us
today. This was a great win for us, especially against a team as good as
Texas A&M."
He said the good kickoff returns by Victor Ike and Ivan Williams in the thi=
rd
quarter gave Texas good field position and helped launch two of the four
third-quarter touchdowns that broke the game open.
"This is a young football team with some great seniors," he said. "We'll ha=
ve
another good recruiting year and the future is bright."
"We've won nine games three years in a row and we've won four of the last s=
ix
against A&M. I was so disappointed when we lost over there last year becaus=
e
of a poor second half, and we wanted to play a great second half this year.=
"
While he said the Longhorns played like a top 10 team, he said getting ther=
e
is just the start. "I want us to finish in the top 10," he said. "We can do
that if we win our bowl game."
Brown said he doesn't know where the Longhorns are likely to wind up in the
bowl derby, but said he expects it to be a good enough bowl "that we will
have a really tough opponent."
"They've got to understand now how to handle a bowl game because we'll
probably be playing a very good team," he said.
Brown also said he is "very proud of Chris Simms. This is a hard place to b=
e
a quarterback.  There are a lot of opinions about the head coach, the
quarterback and the offensive coordinator each day"
He said Simms' situation to start this season was a lot like the team's
situation. "More expectations were put on this team than it deserved," he
said, "and more expectations were put on Chris, too."
Brown said the Longhorn assistant coaches "will go out recruiting
immediately. That's our top priority right now. We won't know our schedule
until we know the timing of our bowl game."
He said he will meet Monday with the members of his staff who are not on th=
e
road recruiting to decide whether to have any practices this week.
Asked to name some players who have exceeded expectations this season, he
said, "The three freshman receivers (Roy Williams, B. J. Johnson and Sloan
Thomas). We knew they were great prospects, but there was no way we could
have anticipated they would play they way they have."
He also said true freshman DE Kalen Thorn-ton, redshirt freshman S Dakarai
Pearson, redshirt freshman DT Marcus Tubbs, sophomore FB Matt Trissel ("he
had 14 knockdowns at Kansas"), and Simms have all played extremely well dow=
n
the stretch.

Horns 12th in Both Polls

Texas is ranked 12th in both the Associated Press poll and the USA Today/ES=
PN
poll.
Three other Big 12 teams are in the AP top 25 =01) No. 1 Oklahoma, No. 8 Ka=
nsas
State and No. 10 Nebraska.

Injury Update

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday QB Major Applewhite might be ready to play in
the Longhorns' bowl game because he will have several weeks to rest his
injured knee.
But he said sophomore QB Chris Simms has played extremely well in the last
two games. "We have two quarterbacks who are good enough to give us a chanc=
e
to win against anybody," he said.
Brown said safety Lee Jackson (leg injury) WR Artie Ellis (shin) and TE Bro=
ck
Edwards (leg) probably will be able to play in the bowl game.
Edwards' injury left the Horns with converted FB Chad Stevens as the only
healthy scholarship TE.
OG Antwan Kirk-Hughes has been having problems with a shoulder, and it
bothered him during the A&M game, but he is expected to be able to play in
the bowl game.

Recruiting Roundup

The loss to Oklahoma didn't have as much impact on some of the top players as
I thought it would.
I talked to MLB Aaron Harris of North Mesquite, OL Justin Blalock of Plano
East and DE Larry Dibbles of Lancaster after the game.
They are the three of the brightest superstars in the Dallas area who are
strongly considering both Texas and Oklahoma.
Harris, who is the bruising middle backer the Longhorns so desperately need,
said, "It was a great game. Both defenses played great."
Asked if the outcome would have any bearing on his decision, he said, "No, I
just want to go some place where they play great defense, and both teams play
great defense."
He said he also plans to visit Texas A&M, Florida and Florida State.
Blalock said the game was exciting and said he sees a chance to play pretty
early at either school, "and that's one of the main things I'm looking for."
He said he isn't close to making a decision, but still is very interested in
Texas.
Dibbles, the kind of physical and fast defensive end the Longhorns covet,
said, "It was a great game and could have gone either way. The outcome won't
influence my decision one way or the other."
He said he still is looking at Texas and OU, as well as several other schools.
* * * *
Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar, who committed to Texas several months
ago, continues to have an outstanding season. Playing on a team that is not
blessed with outstanding talent or speedy wide receivers, he continues to be
one of the top passers in the Dallas area.
He completed 14 of 26 passes for 225 yards and a touchdown Friday in a 29-20
victory over Winnsboro, with no interceptions. He also scored on a 1-yard run
and had 21 net yards rushing on 7 carries.
Malone is a quarterback who sees the field and looks for the most open
receivers.
That ability was what made Major Applewhite so effective for Texas before
severe injuries to both knees gave Chris Simms the starting job.
I think it is the most important talent a college quarterback needs to be
successful.
It's really pretty simple to understand that a pass to an open receiver is a
lot easier to complete with a lot less risk of interception than a pass
thrown to a covered receiver.
Malone also has a strong arm and very good mobility, to go along with his
outstanding field vision. He is a lot better than most gurus think.
* * * *
The Longhorns, with 15 commitments, probably will take another 11 or 12
recruits.
They can take more than the normal 25 limit in this recruiting year because
DE Chase Pittman will graduate in December and enroll in January, which will
allow him to count against last year, and some other players the Horns are
recruiting also could enroll in January.
The key recruits still on the UT radar screen, in addition to the ones
mentioned earlier, are QB Vincent Young of Houston Madison, RB Albert Hardy
of Galena Park, TE Eric Winston of Midland Lee, WRs Robert Timmons of Flower
Mound Marcus (who might get an offer if he stays out of trouble for the rest
of the year), Biren Ealy of Cypress Falls and Anthony Wright of Klein Forest,
OL Tony Ugoh of Spring Westfield, DEs Brian Pickryl of Jenks, Okla.,and
Travis Leitko of The Woodlands, DTs Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings, Kasey
Studdard of Highlands Ranch, Colo., Marco Martin of Mesquite and Loren Howard
of Scottsdale Saquaro, Ariz., CBs Ricky Wilson of Port Arthur Lincoln and
Jonathan Wade of Shreveport Evangel, Safeties Brodney Pool of Houston
Westbury and Matthew Melton of Tyler and Athletes Eddorian McCullough of
North Garland and DaBryan Blanton of Forney.
Here are the Longhorns' 15 early commitments:
Quarterbacks (1)
Billy Don Malone, 6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7, Paris North Lamar
Tight Ends (1)
David Thomas, 6-3, 210, 4.55, Wolfforth Frenship

Nine of the players - Johnson, Pittman, Smith, Davis, Anderson, Sendlein,
Valdez, Tweedie and Thomas - have been on one or more national top 100 lists.
Davis was on all the lists last year.

Looking to the Future

Much has been made of the youth of the powerful Oklahoma team. The Sooners
should be better next year, but so should the Longhorns.
Oklahoma returns 16 starters - eight on offense and eight on defense. Texas
returns 14 starters - eight offensively and six defensively.
Three of the Longhorn senior starters on defense are linebackers, but the
best UT linebacker is true freshman Derrick Johnson.
Some of the brightest stars on both teams are very young. Freshman DT Tommy
Harris and sophomore DE Jimmy Wilkerson are OU's two best defensive linemen.
Texas' top two tight ends and top four wide receivers also are sophomores.
Another thing to remember is that these games often turn on strange things.
In this one, for example, UT had the upper hand early, but OU QB Nate Hybl
was hurt and Jason White replaced him and led the Sooners to victory.
One thing that won't change is the Sooners' great secondary. If you want to
go deep, you had better throw a great pass, and if you want to avoid costly
turnovers in the passing game, you must use your head and not take foolish
chances.
Texas could have won this game. The Longhorns can win next year's game if
they improve their offense, and it should improve because all of the skill
players will be back.
The UT defense joined the offense in being awful last year. The offense was
awful again this year, but the defense played great. The offense needs to
steal a page from that book.
If Chris Simms, Roy Williams, B. J. Johnson, Sloan Thomas, Bo Scaife, Brock
Edwards and either Cedric Benson or Ivan Williams step it up a few notches
next year, the Longhorns might get back on top in this topsy-turvy series.
Both teams' defenses should be better next year, so the winner will be the
team that can get the best and most error-free offensive performance.
It's up to head coach Mack Brown and his assistants to figure out how to do
that. He wants to win a national championship, so he's going to have to
figure it out because there is no question that there is no tougher league
than the Big 12.
On the bright side, despite the fact that Bob Stoops won a national title in
his second year and is competing for another one this year, most of the great
coaches in the country took a little longer.
Darrell Royal, the Longhorns' great one, won his first national title in his
seventh year. Bobby Bowden won his in his 18th season at Florida State. Tom
Osborne took 22 years to win his first one at Nebraska, then won it all in
three of the next four years.
The Longhorns just need to get a little better, and they have the time and
resources to do it.
Just don't give up on the guys and the coaches. Remember how bad we were when
they got there. We're on the right track if we stay the course.

Injury Report

DE Kalen Thornton (sprained knee) and TB Victor Ike (bruised ribs) are the
only Longhorns who were injured in Saturday's game.
Team trainer Tom McVan said Sunday both players will be examined again Monday
to determine whether they can play against Oklahoma State.
It looks like injured LB Lee Jackson (turf toe) will be redshirted. He is a
fourth-year senior who has another year left he he doesn't play this season.

Longhorn Notes . .

* The Texas defense gave up a season low total of 206 yards to the Oklahoma
offense. The Sooners were averaging 388 yards of total offense per game
before playing Texas
* This game marked the first time Texas failed to score a touchdown since a
27-6 loss to No. 24 Arkansas in the 2000 Cotton Bowl
* The last time Texas failed to score a touchdown against Oklahoma was in
1972, when the Sooners took a 27-0 victory.

CB Griffin Becomes Horns' 11th Commitment; Nordgren Getting Close

CB Cedric Griffin, 6-1, 180, 4.42, of San Antonio Holmes has become the
11th
commitment in the Longhorns' drive toward another nationally ranked
recruiting class.
Griffin is one of the state's top cornerbacks and said the Longhorn coaches
"told me I was the kind of tall, fast cornerback they are looking for." He
is
tall for a cornerback, and he is fast, too, having run a 10.5 100 meters
during the last track season.
He had 41 tackles last season, broke up 14 passes and intercepted three
passes, returning two of them for touchdowns. His coach at Holmes, David
Sanchez, said Griffin "is the best cover corner in the district."
Holmes went 13-2 last season, and Sanchez said Griffin is so talented that
he
will play him at wide receiver at times this season.
Griffin said he also had offers from Texas A&M, Oklahoma, Colorado and
Arkansas, "but I really like Texas' style of play and I knew all along
that's
where I wanted to go."
Griffin said he and his mother will come back to Austin on Aug. 2 to meet
with head coach Mack Brown to make the commitment official. "I've never met
coach Brown in person and he was on vacation," Griffin said, "but coach
(Tim)
Nunez told me coach Brown wants me and that he likes to meet with everyone
to
make it official."
"I'm committed to Texas and Texas is committed to me," Griffin said. "Texas
is where I wanted to go and I am looking forward to playing football and
getting my education at Texas."
Griffin and his mother had visited UT unofficially Tuesday. Griffin said he
met with Nunez, who recruits the San Antonio area, and defensive
coordinator
Carl Reese.
The state's top QB, Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch, told me he is
close
to committing to Texas. He and his parents met Monday with UT offensive
coordinator Greg Davis and assistant coach Bruce Chambers, who recruits the
Dallas area, and Nordgren said, "I had a great time. I love Texas and it
would take something really major to cause me to go anywhere else."
Nordgren said he really likes the Texas offense, loves Austin "and my folks
own a ranch near Blanco, so they could see me play if I come to Texas." He
said he probably will announce his college intentions in about 10 days. "I
am
going to take an unofficial visit to A&M and I'm going to go to a camp at
LSU, and then I think I'll be ready. I love everything about Texas, but I
just have to really make sure because I'm going to be spending the next
five
years of my life at the school I pick."
The Longhorns now have 11 early commitments, including six offensive
linemen.
The OLs are Mike Garcia of Galena Park (who switched from A&M to Texas),
Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter, Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village,
Roman Reeves of Livingston, Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls and Alfio
Randall of Blinn JC.
Scott and Robinson are national top 100 players and Randall was a top 100
player at Houston Yates two years ago. The other four commitments are QB/DB
Kendal Briles of Frenship, MLB Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison, and DBs
Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity and Brian Carter of The Woodlands.
I have seen some more tape on Lebron and the gurus, including me, simply
missed on him. I'm glad the Texas coaches do a better job because he's big,
quick and he hits hard. He's also very good in pass coverage.
* * * *
So far, five members of the first team of Dave Campbell's Texas Football
magazine's Super Team have committed to colleges. Running back David
Underwood of Madisonville committed to Michigan and the other four

- Briles,
Robinson, Scott and Griffin
- commited to UT.
* * * *
FOOTBALL NOTES: There are a lot of rumors that super WR recruit Roy
Williams
has reinjured the shoulder the hurt in the Texas-California All-Star game.
I
talked to his mother at 6 p.m. today (Thursday) and she told me she had
talked to Roy about an hour before I called "and he's doing fine. The
shoulder is still a little sore, but he said it's getting better all the
time." She said Williams will come back to Odessa in about two weeks to get
some more treatment on the shoulder. Because he has not enrolled at UT yet,
Texas cannot pick up his medical expenses. . . With football season more
than
a month away, Longhorn ticket sales have already matched their all-time
sing-season high of 48,000. The record was set last year and it will be
broken Friday. The previous record was 39,743 back in 1977.

Simms Working as First Team QB; Horns Get Pledge from Tyler DB

Sophomore QB Chris Simms worked with the first team during Tuesday's
practice, and, if past practices mean anything, that is a pretty good sign
that he will start Saturday night against Houston.
Simms worked with the first team prior to the opening game and he got the
start. Junior Major Applewhite worked with the first team prior to the
Stanford game and he got the start.
Coach Mack Brown won't say who will start at quarterback, but it doesn't
make
a lot of sense to have your starting QB working with the second team, so it
looks like Simms will get his second start Saturday. Simms is more mobile
than Applewhite, who underwent off-season knee surgery, and he also led the
Horns to their first touchdown Saturday at Stanford, despite only getting
14
snaps to Applewhite's 58. Applewhite led the Longhorns to their other two
touchdowns, but they were both in the fourth quarter.
Brown also said he has told his players and coaches that the Texas fans who
are being super critical of the team on the internet and on radio talk
shows
"are hurt. That's the way we feel, too. Our players are hurt and our
coaches
are hurt. None of us want to lose and it hurts us to go that far and play
that hard and still lose because of mistakes at critical times."
But he said the coaches and players are working hard to get the offense
rolling again and shore up the punting team after Stanford scored a
touchdown
on a blocked punt.
Brown said he was amazed at some critics who said the team was lining its
punter up shorter than usual. "He's 13 yards back, just like every other
team
in the country, and we try to get the punt off in 2.1 seconds or less. He
got
the one that was blocked off in 1.9 seconds, but a kid who blocked it
perfectly on the other 11 punts let his guy come through untouched, and it
got blocked."
The Longhorns may have some other punts blocked, but my sources tell me
Brown
chewed so hard on the kid who let the guy through that he will never make
that same mistake again.
Folks, I guarantee you Brown, his assistants and his players are more upset
than any of you over the happenings at Palo Alto and they are working hard
this week to correct things. Remember, the guy the stadium was named after
was a great coach and he had two perfect seasons in 20 years at Texas.
Bobby
Bowden is a pretty good coach, too, and his perfect season at Florida State
last year was his first one.
TB Hodges Mitchell was lining up deeper than usual against Stanford, and
the
coaches have corrected that. Brown also said backup TB Victor Ike will play
more Saturday than he has been playing, and he said redshirt freshman Kenny
Hayter also might see considerable action. "We're going to play as many as
it
takes," Brown said. "We have to get our running game going better."
He also said LG Derrick Dockery might be able to return to full-time duty
Saturday. He has been able to play on sparingly after being hospitalized
for
an infected cyst. "That would help us a lot," he said. "Derrick is one of
our
top offensive linemen."
Defensive coordinator Carl Reese also said redshirt freshman Dakarai
Pearson
will start at strong safety Saturday in place of Lee Jackson, who  has a
pulled hamstring and will miss the Houston game.
Reese said Pearson has a lot of talent, but he said Jackson's experience
will
be missed.
Reese also said he will look at freshman Nathan Vasher and juniors Ahmad
Brooks and Ervis Hill to replace Pearson in the Longhorns' nickel and dime
packages. He said the team will play with five and six defensive backs a
lot
Saturday "because Houston will throw it about 50 times."
* * * *
ANOTHER RECRUIT COMMITS: Texas has 16 commitments now after getting a
pledge
from Tyler CB Aaron Ross, 6-1, 182, 4.42. Ross had offers from Alabama,
Arkansas, Baylor, LSU, Oklahoma, Texas A&M and others, but said he
committed
to Texas "because I've always been a Longhorrn fan, and I really like the
Texas coaches." He said Darryl Drake and Everett Withers were the two Texas
coaches who recruited him, and he said Withers, the Texas secondary coach,
came to see him play in his second game this season. He is a big, fast
corner
with long arms, but don't look for him to get many interceptions this year
because he hasn't had a pass thrown in his direction all year because he is
so good at tight man-for-man coverage.

Hey Baby,

Today's been soooo crazy.  I haven't had time to get anything done today.

There not much else I can tell you about the project.  If it would help, I
could find out how far offshore the platform is.  El Paso has 2 pipeline
networks offshore Louisiana.  He can pick either one.  It really doesn't
matter to us.  We just want an estimate.

Did you email my mom yet?  I hope so!

Also, I won't be home until kind of late tonight.  My design group has a
meeting at 7 pm.  I probably won't be home until after 9.  I'll try to call
you between 5:30 and 7, okay?  If not, email me.

Love you,
Jenn

Longhorns Find Running Game Just in Time
To Maul OSU in Big 12 Opener; OU Next Foe

The Longhorns ran over, around and through the Oklahoma State Cowboys and
their No. 1-rated rushing defense Saturday en route to a 42-7 victory befor=
e
a sellout crowd in Austin.
The Cowboys, while they hadn't played a good rushing team in their first
three games, had allowed only 91 net yards rushing all season and they real=
ly
do have a pretty salty front seven.
Led by sophomore Kenny Hayter's 122 yards, the Longhorns had 205 net yards
rushing. It was the first time Texas has has 100 net rushing yards in a gam=
e
since the 58-7 thumping of Texas Tech last season.
In the six games they played between Texas Tech and Oklahoma State when the=
y
couldn't reach the century mark in rushing, it's no coincidence that they w=
on
just twice.
But they utilized a new gap-blocking technique  to combat the Cowboys'
stunting defense, and it worked to near perfection because Hayter, who was =
a
little used third-team tailback, turned a lot of little holes into big ones
with his hard running.
While the rebirth of the running game was the big overall story, it didn't
happen until the second half and UT had a shaky 10-7 lead at that point.
Texas still might have lost the game without three crucial earlier
developments =01)  a huge passing play, a great defensive stand after still
another special teams goof and a penalty against the Cowboys that wiped out=
 a
potentially game-turning interception.
The huge passing play, of course, was Major Applewhite's 96-yard pass-and-r=
un
connection with sensational freshman WR Roy Williams six minutes deep into
the second half
The Horns were holding a fragile 10-7 lead at the time, they were facing a
third-and-14 and they had already had so many problems with  their punting
team that UT fans everywhere were simply hoping for a miracle first down.
After all, coaches everywhere say the first five minutes of the second half
is the most crucial period in a tight game, and the first five minutes had
been all Oklahoma State. The Longhorns hadn't even made a first down since
the intermission.
But they got a lot more than that. Williams got past the Cowboy cornerback
who was covering him and Applewhite looked left and drew the safety back
toward the middle.
When he finally looked to the right and heaved the ball, the only question
was whether Williams could catch up to it because there are few people in
college football who can catch the fleet freshman.
He did, catching it on his fingertips and racing untouched the rest of the
way. That 96-yard play gave Texas a 17-7 lead and it was all downhill after
that for the Longhorns.
But that play was a gamebreaker only because the Longhorn defense stopped t=
he
Cowboys cold early in the second quarter when a fake punt lost yardage and
put OSU in possession at the UT 38, and because an interception of a Chris
Simms' pass and a long runback inside the UT 10 was negated by a personal
foul penalty against the Cowboys.
The defensive stand came on the series after a blocked UT punt set up OSU's
only touchdown. The Cowboys were leading, 7-3, and the Longhorns, at that
point, hadn't generated enough offense to indicate they could fall farther
behind.
The disallowed interception was a possible 10-point swing because OSU might
have scored with a first-and-goal inside the UT 10. Instead, the Horns kept
the ball and continued a drive that ended in the field goal that opened the
scoring.

Here, briefly, is how the game went:

FIRST QUARTER
Neither team threatened early, but the Horns dodged a bullet on their secon=
d
possession. They started in good field possession, but Simms threw an
interception that was run back inside the UT 10 before a personal foul
against OSU negated the play and gave Texas a first down at the OSU 29. Tex=
as
couldn't move and Stockton kicked a 45-yard field goal to put the Horns
ahead, 3-0, with 7:00 left. OSU TB Reggie White broke loose for 69 yards to
the UT 11 on the Cowboys' next possession, but the UT defense held and the
Cowboys missed a chip-shot field goal try. Applewhite came in at QB for
Texas. UT led, 3-0, at the end of the quarter, but the Longhorns had only o=
ne
first down =01) on the penalty that negated the long interception return =
=01) and
just 30 yards of total offense compared to 100 for OSU.

SECOND QUARTER
The UT defense stopped OSU and forced a punt. With Applewhite still in at
QB, sophomore RB Kenny Hayter got a first down on two tough runs, then seni=
or
TB Hodges Mitchell took a quick pitch around left end for 18 yards. But
Applewhite was sacked and his third-down pass to freshman WR B. J. Johnson
was dropped. That was unfortunate because it forced Stockton to punt, the
snap was high, a defender got loose up the middle and the kick was blocked.
Stockton covered it at the UT 30, and OSU's White scored in two plays,
galloping 21 yard to the 9, then bursting up the middle untouched for the
score to put OSU ahead, 7-3, with  9:59 left. The next UT drive also came u=
p
short, but, facing fourth and 1 at their own 40, the Horns went with a fake
punt. It was a disaster and Stockton was tackled for a two-yard loss. But t=
he
strong UT defense yielded only two yards in three plays and got the ball ba=
ck
for the offense. On his third try, Applewhite got the Longhorns into the en=
d
zone, driving 80 yards in seven plays. Mitchell got the TD on a 3-yard run,
but the big plays were Applewhite's passes of 15 yards to WR Montrell
Flowers, 14 yards on third-and-9 to Johnson and 36 yards to the 3 to
Williams. Stockton's kick gave Texas a 10-7 lead with 4:23 left. OSU got
close enough to try a field goal as time expired, but Ervis Hill blocked it=
.
UT outgained OSU, 140 to 80, in the period.

THIRD QUARTER
A combination of mishaps, including a sack and a half-the-distance penalty,
left the Longhorns facing a third and 14 from their own 4. Visions of anoth=
er
punting adventure were etched into the brains of Longhorns everywhere, but
Applewhite dropped back and found Williams breaking open between double
coverage just past midfield. He heaved it and the swift freshman caught it =
on
his fingertips and raced untouched into the end zone to complete a 96-yard
touchdown play. Stockton's kick put UT ahead, 17-7, with 9:14 left. Lindsay
and White misfired on a handoff two plays later and  UT LB De'Andre Lewis
recovered for Texas at the 13. Hayter powered to the 1 to set up a
first-and-goal. He tried to go over the top, but the Cowboys stopped him,
then the Horns were penalized back to the 6 for a false start. Hayter got
three yards to the 3 off right tackle, but Applewhite's pass on third down
was knocked down and Stockton's 20-yard field goal gave Texas a 20-7 lead
with 6:03 left. Applewhite hit redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis for 21 yard=
s
and another TD with 2:11 left. A two-point conversion try failed, leaving U=
P
on top, 26-7, heading into the final period.

FOURTH QUARTER
With Hayter making good gains and Applewhite hitting key passes, the
Longhorns drove 58 yards to set up a 36-yard Stockton FG and moved 42 yards
for a touchdown, with Applewhite connecting with Flowers for the final 2
yards, Ivan Williams ran 21 yards for the final score with 13 seconds left.

900 Number Updated Daily

I update my 900 number daily with football and football recruiting news. Th=
e
number is 1-900-288-8839. It costs $1.59 a minute. You must be 18 to call.

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday the Longhorn offense had its best day of the
season against Oklahoma State, the defense did its usual fine job and the
special teams, with one notable exception, were outstanding.
"After reviewing the film, it's clear that it was the best performance we'v=
e
had offensively," he said. "We scored 42 points and we had no turnovers. Th=
e
offensive line had its best performance."
"We were pleased with not only the offensive line, but Roy Williams made so=
me
great blocks, too, and Kenny Hayter made some tough runs."
He also said junior QB Major Applewhite, who underwent off-season knee
surgery, "played like the Major of old. He made very, very few mistakes."
The Major of old was very good. He was the Big 12 Offensive Newcomer of the
Year as a redshirt freshman in 1998 and the Co-Offensive Player of the Year
as a sophomore in 1999.
Applewhite and sophomore Chris Simms have been dividing time at QB, and Sim=
ms
started the OSU game, but gave way to Applewhite late in the first quarter.
Applewhite completed 15 of 28 passes for 291 yards and three touchdowns.
Simms, who returned late in the game, completed 3 of 5 passes for 8 yards.
Brown said the defense "continues to swarm and play really well. Casey
Hampton is amazing and D. D. Lewis had an outstanding day. Quentin Jammer a=
nd
Rod Babers played really well. We had another blocked kick. that's our 12th
in 30 games here. I thought it was Tyrone Jones, but it was Ervis Hill who
blocked the field goal. It's interesting that our two best kick blockers ar=
e
both from Texas City."
The special teams played well, Brown said, except for having another punt
blocked, and he said that is something that simply has to be fixed.
"The two blocked punts this year have been in different areas," he said, "b=
ut
we have to get it fixed. We can't keep getting punts blocked."
He said the UT-OU game was such a big game 15 or 20 years ago "that the
feeling was that the team that won this game had a chance to win the nation=
al
championship." He said he and OU coach Bob Stoops "are trying to get back t=
o
that."
INJURY UPDATE: Brown said SS Lee Jackson suited out against Oklahoma State
and should be ready to play against Oklahoma. He said DT Shaun Rogers
(sprained ankle) is questionable for the OU game. "We should know more abou=
t
Shaun Tuesday," he said. LB O. J. McClintock also missed the OSU game
(bruised knee), but he should be back this week.
BLOCKING, QUARTERBACK NOTES: The big change in the UT running game was
basically one new play - a counter with an off side guard pulling and the
linemen blocking down on the play side. The QB also handed off at least par=
t
of the time on one side and the back veered to the other side for a little
bit of misdirection. . . Major Applewhite's knee has been one of he major (=
no
pun intended) reasons the coaches have tried to use Chris Simms so much in
the early games. Applewhite still isn't 100%, but he's getting closer every
week. In fact, he looked pretty close to 100% Saturday. That's just in time
because the Sooners look pretty potent and the Horns need to have two top
quarterbacks ready to go.

Baseball Recruiting Going Great

The UT  baseball coaches got a commitment last week from right-handed pitch=
er
Donald Lavinski, 6-4, 205, of Class AA state champion Weimar, giving them
pledges from two of the state's big three pitching recruits. They also got =
a
pledge from catcher Curtis Thigpen, 6-0, 175, of Forney.
Round Rock's Joey Guajardo, another right-hander, committed several months
ago. The third member of the big three pitching group is David Purcey, 6-5,
230, a left-hander from Dallas Trinity Christian. He is considering Texas,
A&M and OU.
Purcey was 21-3 at Trinity Christian the last two years and his team won
back-to-back state TAPPS' championships. He also helped his team win a stat=
e
TAPPS' title in basketball last year. He had 123 strikeouts in 75 1/3 innin=
gs
last year.
Lavinski was 14-1 last year with an outstanding 0.70 ERA. His fast ball has
been clocked as high as 93 miles per hour and he is consistently in the 90
mph range. He also has great command of a sinking fast ball and a change up=
.
He struck out 170 batters in 95 innings last year, while issuing about 25
walks and giving up about 40 hits.
He said he also had scholarship offers from Texas A&M, Baylor, Rice, Housto=
n
and Oklahoma State.
Thigpen is an outstanding defensive catcher, but he also wields a potent ba=
t,
bashing opposing pitchers for a .515 batting average last season.
He  also considered Alabama, Baylor and A&M.
Lavinski, Thigpen and Pursey all visited Texas the September 23 weekend,
along with shortstop Michael Holloman, 6-0, 165, of Dallas Jesuit.
Holloman said he is considering Texas and Stanford. He visited Texas earlie=
r
and took his official trip to Stanford last weekend.

Horns Rise in Polls

The Longhorns are No. 11 in this week's Associated Press poll and No. 10 in
the ESPN/USA Today coaches poll. Oklahoma, this week's opponent, is No. 10 =
in
the AP poll and No. 12 in the coaches poll. UT is a 3-point favorite.

Basketball Stars Visit

Kala Bowers, 6-2, of Woodward, Okla., a top national recruit in girls
basketball, took her official visit to Texas last weekend.
She is considering Texas, Colorado, Illinois and Kansas State, and says Tex=
as
and Colorado are her big two.
Heather Schreiber, a versatile 6-2 forward from Windthorst and CoCo Reed, a
5-11 forward from Jersey Village, also came to Austin last weekend. Both
committed to the Longhorns earlier.
Three top juniors also were in Austin on unofficial visits. They are  5-9
point guard Nina Norman of Jersey Village, 5-10 shooting guard Lindsay
Harding of Cypress Fairbanks and 6-1 forward Nichelle Roberts of Spring
Westfield.
Schrieber and Bowers are both rated as top 25 national recruits, and Norman
will be one of the nation's top point guard recruits next season.
Reed and Roberts play on the same high school team and they also play on th=
e
same AAU team, along with Harding.

Scouting Houston
The Longhorns should be able to get back on the winning track Saturday nigh=
t
when they host Houston at 6 p.m. in a game that will be a regional Fox
telecast.
The Cougars won their first game of the season Saturday, defeating Army,
31-30. Army had a chence to win with a 32-yard field goal on the final play
of the game, but UH defensive back Emile White blocked it.
Houston had lost its first two games, 30-27, to Rice in overtime, and 28-13
to LSU.
New Cougar coach Dana Dimel has installed an all-out passing offense and hi=
s
QB, senior Jason McKinley, is fifth in the nation in total offense with 333=
.3
yards per game.
The Cougars are sixth in passing with 346.3 yards per game, and WR Brian
Robinson is among the national leaders with 31 catches for 299 yards.
The Cougars gained 524 yards against Army and ran 92 plays.
Defensively, Houston has struggled.
In losing to Stanford last week, the Longhorns lost all three of the "keys =
to
victory" I cited in my scouting report. They lost the rushing battle, they
didn't put as much pressure on the Stanford QBs as the Cardinal defenders p=
ut
on the Texas signal callers, and they had two turnovers, while Stanford had
none.
The Cougars are far less formidable than Stanford, so Texas should win fair=
ly
easily.
Here are three keys to victory, in my opinion:
1. Do a better job of running the football. That's not a huge order since t=
he
Horns are averaging only 50 yards per game on the ground.
2. Protect the Texas quarterbacks. Stanford got five sacks and had tremendo=
us
pressure on the Texas QBs most of the game.
3. Put a lot of pressure on McKinley. The Texas secondary gives up a lot of
big plays when opposing QBs have time to throw.
Long-Range Outlook
Coach Mack Brown likes to talk about four or five "key games" on the
schedule. He doesn't mean the other games are against patsies, but let's ta=
ke
a look at the teams Texas plays this year.
First, there are six games the Longhorns should win. The opening victory ov=
er
Louisiana-Lafayette was one of those. The others are Houston, Oklahoma Stat=
e,
Missouri, Baylor and Kansas.
If Texas takes care of business in those six games, the other five will be
the key to going 10-1 or 6-5 or somewhere in between this season.
Stanford, as Brown noted, was one of the key games, so Texas is 0-1 in the
big games. The others are Oklahoma, Colorado, Texas Tech and Texas A&M.
Texas needs to win at least three of those to have a chance to finish 9-2 a=
nd
win the Big 12's Southern Division title.

Recruiting Roundup

The Longhorns picked up two more commitments last week, getting LB Lance
McFarland, 6-1, 225, 4.6, of Jefferson early in the week, followed by a
pledge from his teammate, RB Anthony Johnson, 5-11, 195, 4.4, on Friday.
Johnson rushed for more than 200 yards in a loss to defending Class 3A
chamion Texarkana Libery-Eylau earlier this season. He has great power,
outstanding moves and tremendous speed. In other words, he has all the
attributes of an outstanding running back.
He also has confidence. The Longhorns already have a commitment from super
Midland Lee RB Cedric Benson, but Johnson says that doesn't worry him.
"I want to play on a great college team," he said. You're going to have
competition wherever you go if you want to play for a winning program."
His coach, Jerry Bennett, is the brother of Kansas State's defensive
coordinator, and Johnson said the Wildcats finished No. 2 on his list.
The Wildcats also were after McFarland, a hard-nosed tackle with good speed
for a linebacker. He won a "fat-boy" 100 event after his sophomore year wit=
h
an 11.3 clocking. Only players who weighed more than 200 pounds competed.
The two additions give the Longhorns 15 early commitments. It looks more an=
d
more like the Texas coaches will award close to 25 scholarships  because th=
ey
still hope to add four of five defensive linemen, a quarterback, a tight en=
d,
a wide receiver, a linebacker, a safety and at least one cornerback.
Seven of the Longhorns' 15 commitments are offensive linemen. Texas has
signed only three offensive linemen in each of coach Mack Brown's three
previous recruiting classes and he said heading into this recruiting season
that the offensive line was the No. 1 priority.
But he also said the defensive line was a high priority, and that is where
most of the remaining scholarships probably will be awarded.
Here's a list of the Horns' early commitments:
Offensive Line (7)
Jonathan Scott, 6-7, 290, 4.9, Dallas Carter, a national top 25 player.
Abe Robinson, 6-6, 270, 4.9, Jersey Village, a national top 100 player.
Alfio Randall, 6-6, 300, 5.1, Blinn JC, was a national top 100 player two
years ago.
Mike Garcia, 6-5, 280, 5.2, Galena Park, was the Aggies' top early pledge
before switching to UT.
Will Allen, 6-5, 300, 5.2, Cypress Falls, is in his three year as a starter=
.
Roman Reeves, 6-6, 295, 5.2, another of the state's top eight offensive
linemen.
Terrance Young, 6-6, 340, 5.5, Longview, is tremendously strong and had
offers from several top schools before committing to Texas.
Running Back (2)
Cedric Benson, 5-11, 200, 4.5, Midland Lee, the greatest Class 5A rusher an=
d
scorer in state history and a national top 25 player.
Anthony Johnson, 5-11, 195, 4.4, Jefferson, No. 19 on my top 25 list.
Linebacker (2)
Yamil LeBron, 6-2, 240, 4.7, Killeen Ellison, was the middle backer the
Longhorns targeted early.
Lance McFarland, 6-1, 225, 4.6, Jefferson, No. 23 on my top 25 list.
Defensive Back (4)
Cedric Griffin, 6-1, 180, 4.42, San Antonio Holmes, one of the state's top
two cornerbacks.
Kendal Briles, 5-10, 175, 4.5, Wolfforth Frenship, a great option QB who wi=
ll
play safety at Texas.
Braden Johnson, 6-2, 200, 4.5, Euless Trinity, a fine athlete who is playin=
g
QB this season.
Brian Carter, 5-11, 180, 4.5, The Woodlands, a two-way star at WR and CB.
RECRUITING NOTES: Super FB James Buchanon of Sarasota, Fla., plans to take
his official visit to Texas this weekend. . . DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia H=
S
in Placentia, Cal., says he will visit this weekend or the following weeken=
d.
Jakes is playing nose guard this year and said he had two sacks and several
other tackles for losses in Valencia's opening 24-0 victory over Palmdale
Highland. He said Highland is supposed to have a playoff-caliber team "and =
we
really shut them down." Jakes lived in Plano when he was in junior high and
he said he is strongly considering coming to UT. "I really like the way
football is king in Texas," he said. . . Super DT Tommie Harris of Killeen
Ellison and outstanding OL William Winston of Houston Madison both say they
plan to come to the Houston game this weekend on unofficial visits. Harris =
is
the nation's top DT prospect, and Winston is a dominating OL.  . . UT pledg=
e
Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity rallied his team from a 14-3 third-quarter
deficit to a 17-14 victory over Arlington Martin by running 58 and 1 yards
for TDs. . . DE Eric Hall of Clarksville, Tenn., took his official visit to
Texas the Sept. 9 weekend and said he really enjoyed it. He said Texas is h=
is
favorite right now, but said he wants to take some other visits before
committing to anyone. Hall was born in Fort Hood and, like Jakes, says he h=
as
fond memories of Texas football.

Satchell, Richardson Status

Two Longhorn freshmen football players, linebacker Aurmon Satchell and RB
Tyrone Richardson, have been lost to the team for at least this semester.
Satchell and Richardson both said they have some academic issues that need =
to
be resolved before they can return. Both said they hope to be back in Janua=
ry.
Satchell is from Denver Jefferson and Richardson is from Clarksville.

True Orange Observations

Coach Mack Brown is in his third year of what should have been a major
rebuilding job at Texas.
Thanks to the way he and his assistants took charge and changed one of the
nation's worst defenses into one of its best, and thanks to the way they
recruit, the Longhorns are already back among the nation's elite.
I know they lost at Stanford. I didn't like it. The coaches and players
didn't like it either. It bothers them even more than it bothers us.
But Texas hasn't finished among the nation's top 10 in football since 1983,
so we probably all expected too much from this team. The Horns will finish =
in
the top 10 again very soon and probably next year if not this one.
With three great recruiting classes already in school and a fourth in the
making, there are going to be a lot more W's than L's in the weeks and year=
s
ahead.
Let's be grateful for what he and his assistants and players have
accomplished and help them get back on the winning track.

Gustafson's Lawsuit Dismissed

State District Judge J. Scott McCown ruled last week that former Longhorn
baseball coach Cliff Gustafson's lawsuit against UT athletic director DeLos=
s
Dodds has no merit and he dismissed it.
McCown also said Dodds has official immunity from such a lawsuit.
The lawsuit alleged that Dodds falsified an outside income statement by
Gustafson and provided false information to then-UT president Robert Berdah=
l
that Gustfson has violated university rules by maintaining a non-university
bank account for a baseball camp. The suit alleged Dodds' actions forced hi=
m
to resign.
The judge ordered Gustafson to pay Dodds' court costs.

Basketball Recruiting

T. J. Ford, the outstanding point guard at Fort Bend Willowridge, says he h=
ad
a great visit to Texas the Sept. 9 weekend, but isn't ready to commit to
anyone until he looks at some other schools.
UCLA probably is the Horns' main competition for Ford, a super quick 5-11
star who is the state's No. prospect. He  led Willowridge to the state Clas=
s
5A title and a 36-1 record last season.
Coach Rick Barnes only has one more scholarship to award, so UT's recruitin=
g
will be over for this year if Ford commits to the Longhorns.
The Longhorn women are going to get a visit late this month from Kala Bower=
s,
a 6-2 forward from Woodward, Okla.
She is a national top 25 star who plays on a team that has lost only two
games in the last two years.
Coach Jody Conradt already has a pledge from the state's top prospect, 6-2
forward Heather Schreiber of Windthorst.

Kelly to Miss Fall Semester

Senior guard Darren Kelly  will miss the fall semester, Longhorn basketball
coach Rick Barnes announced last week. Kelly hopes to return to game action
for the Longhorns following the fall semester.
"It is going to be difficult not being able to play this fall, but I have
some academic issues that I need to take care of to return to the team,"
Kelly said. "I am going to attempt to take care of that this fall and hope =
to
rejoin the team in December."
Kelly was slated to return for his second season as the team's starting
shooting guard. He earned Big 12 Conference All-Newcomer and All-Bench team
recognition as a junior, averaging 10 points and 3.1 rebounds per game.
He was third on the squad in scoring and second in assists (81) last season=
.
He also was the top three-point shooter on the team and second-best in the
Big 12 (.452), including a .500 mark in league play (25-of-50).
"I'm sad for Darren because he had made such great strides in his game duri=
ng
the latter part of last year and over the summer, and he had really taken a
strong leadership role on this team," Barnes said.
"With the addition of so many new guys this year, there's no question that
his loss in the fall will hurt us. Hopefully he'll be able to return to the
team and give us a big lift heading into Big 12 Conference play."

The State of the Longhorns: Good and Getting Better

My faxes are normally about hot breaking news, but this  one is about the
big
picture, as I see it, on the state of the current Longhorn football team
and
on the recruiting front.
First, let's look at the 2000 season prospects. The Longhorns are better
equipped to handle all comers this year than they have been in a long, long
time. The 2000 Texas defense is the best since 1991, when the defense was
great, but the offense and kicking game were so bad that it resulted in a
losing season and a new coaching staff.
The Longhorn defense won't allow many teams to run the ball at all. The
tackles, linebackers and defensive backs are killers against the run, and
the
young ends are getting better every practice. Sophomore DE Cory Redding is
going to be a great one, and true freshman Kalen Thornton looks like he is
going to be a quick developer on the other side.
The offense has two great quarterbacks in Major Applewhite and Chris Simms,
and, for those who say a two-quarterback system can't work, coach Mack
Brown
is quick to point out that he used a two-QB system twice at North Carolina
and won 11 games one time and 10 the other.
It also has some freshmen wide receivers who don't play like freshmen. Roy
Williams and B. J. Johnson are ready for prime time already, and Sloan
Thomas
is getting there. They are all big and fast. Last year, Texas had one big
wide receiver last year, but he wasn't very fast. Redshirt freshman Artie
Ellis also is big and he's pretty fast, too.
The Longhorns also have some capable running backs and an offensive line
that
definitely is a lot better than it was late last season. The only big cloud
hovering over the offense is the question about whether they will be able
to
grind out yardage when they need to control the clock. I think they will be
able to score and score quite a bit on everybody they play, but they
probably
will have to do it with big plays, rather than 16-play drives.
After attending every practice during 2-a-days, I predict a 10-1 or 11-0
regular season record.
* * * *
Now, let's talk recruiting. I went to San Antonio to see the triple header
in
the Alamodome and am happy to report that Cedric Benson, the great Midland
Lee running back who is the Longhorns' most recent commitment, is even
better
than he was last year.
He's about 10 pounds bigger at around 198, and his coach, John Parchman,
says
he has lowered his time in the 40 from the high 4.5s to a consistent 4.4.
He
looked quicker than last year, and he was fast enough last year to shatter
all the Class 5A rushing and scoring records.
Running behind an all-new offensive line, he carried 14 times for 140
yards,
including a 52-yard scoring run on his third carry of the game. He also had
a
pass reception for 36 yards.
Lee beat a good Victoria Memorial team, 40-12. Memorial is a combination of
the two Class 5A schools in Victoria, one of which went 8-3 last year.
Fred Thrweatt, the 6-2, 300-pound Midland Lee defensive tackle who was a
dominant force in the Class 5A championship game last year, was at it again
Saturday. He was a tremendous run-stopper, who also harassed the Memorial
QBs
when they tried to pass. He says Texas has offered him, and I hope he
accepts
because, next to Killeen's awesome Tommie Harris, he is as good as any I
have
seen in Texas this year. DE Dwight Washington, 6-4, 232, is another Lee
standout who will get a lot of Division I offers. He is an outstanding pass
rusher.
For your future's book, put down QB Chad Schroeder, 6-1, 170, 4.5, of
Austin
Westlake. He's the son of highly successful Westlake coach Ron Schroeder
and
he's only a junior. He has a good arm and really quick feet. But he broke a
collarbone in the Chaps' hard-earned 17-10 victory over a tough San Antonio
MacArthur team in the first game of that tripleheader.
In the second game, which pitted the two undefeated Class 4A champions from
last year, Texas City struck quickly and outlasted Stephenville, 39-33.
* * * *
FOOTBALL  NOTES: The team returns to practice Monday after getting three
days
off to rest the players' tired legs. . . Derrick Curry, a fifth-year senior
reserve defensive tackle, has quit the team.

My next fax will be whenever events warrant.

22. CB Kendrick Muckelroy, Hallsville
23. Ath DaBryan Blanton, Forney
24. WR Robert Timmons, Flower Mound Marcus
25. OL Bret Valdez, Brownwood

Out-of-State Prospects

These out-of-state prospects say they are considering Texas:
DT Lyle Sendlein, 6-4, 260, 4.8, Scottsdale Chaparral (UT, Mich, Cal, USC,
PSU)
DT Kasey Studdard, 6-3, 265, 4.8, Highlands Ranch, Colo (UT, Colo)

FB-LB Brandon Hancock, 6-2, 240, 4.55, Clovis, Cal., West (USC, UCLA, UT,
Mich)
LB Chris Herring, 6-2, 255, 4.5, Batesville, Miss.(Miss, MSU, Fla, Tenn, UT=
)

Recruiting Roundup

CB Edorian McCullough of North Garland ran a wind-aided 9.96 100 meters
Friday night. He is  one of the top junior recruits in the state. He favors
Texas over Oklahoma
WR Marquis Johnson, 6-3 1/2, 195, 4.4, of Centennial HS in Champaign, Ill.,
is one of the top receivers in the country and he is a Texas fan.
I watched him on tape last week and he  has size, speed, great hands and,
best of all, he is fearless when he comes across the middle. He caught 45
passes for 862 yards and 11 TDs last year.
He told me, "I've been a Texas fan since I was a little kid. I like the way
they run their offense."
He has an offer from Illinois, and is considering Michigan and Notre Dame,
but he plans to visit Texas unofficially this summer with his parents.
Don't be surprised if Texas signs several out-of-state players. Three
excellent players listed on the previous page =01) DE Chase Pittman and DTs=
 Lyle
Sendlein and Kasey Studdard =01) have strong Longhorn bloodlines and are
seriously considering UT.
RB Zan Johnson of Winnfield, La., one of the top players in that state, als=
o
has several relatives who are Longhorn grads, including former UT LB Lionel
Johnson. Johnson, Pittman and Sendlein all came to the UT spring game.
Two LB-FB combos =01) Brandon Hancock, 6-2, 240, 4.55, of Clovis, Cal., Wes=
t,
and Chris Herring, 6-2, 255, 4.5, Batesville, Miss., South Panola =01) also=
 are
considering the Longhorns, but are longer shots than the ones mentioned
previously.
Three players who have really zoomed up the recruiting charts since college
coaches started watching their tapes are LB Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar=
,
S Vickiel Vaughn of Plano East and OL Bret Valdez of Brownwood.
I've seen tape now and it's easy to understand why the college coaches like
them.
Smith is extremely quick and hard-hitting, Vaughn is a fast, hard-tackling
ball hawk and Valdez is a devastating blocker with really quick feet in
Brownwood's option attack.
Valdez came to the Texas spring game. Smith also is interested in the Horns=
,
but Vaughn is interested only in out-of-state schools right now.
I have listed other sports instead of schools by three players on my list o=
n
page 4.
At WR, Wardell Starling of Fort Bend Elkins will be a first-round  baseball
draft choice and will get a bonus offer that will almost certainly keep him
from playhing college football.
In the Athlete category, LeKeldrick Bridges of Dallas Hillcrest, and in the
Safeties, Bam Harmon of The Colony, both say they want to play college
basketball, not football.
All three are fine players. I left them on the list, just like I leave the
academic problems on the list, because I think we need to know who the best
prospects are at every position.

UT Drops 2 of 3 to Huskers

The Longhorns played the heck out of fifth-ranked and defending Big 12
baseball champion Nebraska last weekend, but they had trouble holding
late-inning leads until the final game.
Freshman lefthander Justin Simmons scattered eight hits and quelled a
Nebraska threat in the ninth inning to give Texas a 2-1 victory Sunday in t=
he
series finale in Lincoln.
Kalani Napolean made a perfect bunt to squeeze Ben King home from third in
the top of the ninth to break the 1-1 tie and give Texas the victory.
Simmons worked out of a two-out, two-on Husker threat in the bottom of the
ninth.
The game was scoreless until the sixth when Omar Quintanilla doubled and Ma=
tt
Rosenberg singled to give Texas a 1-0 lead. The Huskers tied it in the
seventh.
The Huskers had swept a doubleheader Saturday, 10-8 in 10 innings, and 5-4,
after Friday's opener was rained out.
Texas scored twice in the top of the ninth to take an 8-7 lead in Saturday'=
s
opener, but Nebraska tied it with a single run, then won it in the 10th on
Adam Stern's two-run homer.
Texas ace Albert Montez was in fine form through seven innings and had a 4-=
1
lead in the second game Saturday before Nebraska scored four runs in the
eighth for the winning rally.
The Longhorns fell to 13-5 in the Big 12, while Nebraska is 10-3. Texas is =
in
third place behind the Huskers and Baylor, at 12-3.
UT hosts Missouri in a three-game series this weekend.

Horns Get Great JC Punter; Brown Says Team Will Bounce Back

Trinity Valley JC coach Chuck Langston says his punter, Brian Bradford,
"will
punt in the NFL someday. He's the best one I've ever been around."
That's good because Bradford committed to the Longhorns Sunday night.
Langston, who played and later coached at Oklahoma, said, "He's better than
any of the ones we ever had at OU when I was there. He averages better than
43 yards and he gets tremendous hang time, in the 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 (second)
range, which is really outstanding. He really gets great height and great
distance."
Langston said Bradford "is our team's most valuable player. He's one of the
those guys who  turns the field over. He really changes field position."
Bradford told me he has "always wanted to play for the Longhorns." He was a
full qualifier out of Lufkin High School and said he will transfer to Texas
in January so he can go through spring training with the Longhorns.
He is the Longhorns' 17th commitment, but he can be counted against last
year's class because he will enroll at mid-year.
* * * *
Coach Mack Brown said Monday the Longhorn coaches are "going to look at
personnel across the board" to try to find players who can help get the
team
back on the winning track.
Brown said the 63-14 loss to Oklahoma  was "my worst day as a coach,"  but
he
said he has to get the team playing well in a hurry to have a chance to
beat
Colorado in Boulder Saturday. He also said he expects the team to bounce
back
strongly.
"My job this week is to be hard, be tough, but to give them some hope," he
said. "This is the wrong week to be going to Boulder. They changed
quarterbacks and he (freshman Craig Ochs) played great at A&M. Colorado
also
has the best offensive line we've played this year. It's going to be a big
challenge."
Brown also said the Longhorns need to develop an identity on offense. He
said
he wants to be able to run the ball better, but said the Horns have done
better from the shotgun with four wideouts than with anything else they
have
tried this year.
He also hinted he might quit using his two-quarterback system, but said the
coaches always talk to the players before making any statement to the
press.
The Buffs are a 1-point favorite, and Brown said the Longhorns, who have
"played well in our stadium and played poorly away from it," need to play
their best game of the season to win.
He said DT Shaun Rogers, who has missed the last two games with a sprained
ankle, is much better and probably will be able to play Saturday.
All America DT Casey Hampton said getting Rogers back would really help the
defense. "When Shaun is in there, it makes us a lot better," Hampton said.
Hampton and Rogers draw frequent double-team blocks, which frees the
defensive ends and linebackers to make more plays. With Rogers out, OU was
able to double-team both Hampton and DE Corey Redding at times Saturday by
using a back to help with the block on Redding.
* * * *
The Longhorns' home game with Missouri next week will be an early afternoon
or night game. The TV networks are allowed to wait six days before a game
to
make their selections three times each year, and they exercised one of
those
options on the Texas-Missouri game. That game is one of three vying for two
TV spots, one at 2:30 p.m. and one at 6 p.,m. If  it isn't picked for TV,
it
probably will start at noon or 1 p.m.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: QB Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch  says he probably
will announce his college choice later this week. He said Texas and LSU are
the main contenders, with Colorado and Tennessee also in the mix. "I'm
going
to call all the coaches and talk to them one last time to hear they have to
say," he said. Nordgren has been a strong Texas lean for several weeks, but
he also is very interested in LSU

Kansas Game Set for 1 p.m., No TV; Brown Says Tech Dangerous Foe

The Longhorns' game next week at Kansas has been set for 1 p.m. with no
television. This is the second faraway game this year that has not been
televised. The other one was at Colorado.
Folks, one of the primary reasons that was given for the Longhorns playing
Louisiana-Lafayette with that ridiculous 11 a.m. kickoff back in early
September when it was hot as blazes was that the TV brass appreciated Texas
making an extra effort and would reciprocate down the line.
Well, it hasn't happened. The Baylor-A&M game was shown in place of the
Texas-Colorado game back on Oct. 14. Any big Baylor or A&M fans could make
it
to Waco a lot easier than Longhorn fans could make it to Boulder.
Don't let anyone tell you that UT has any extra pull with the TV guys. When
neither of our two longest Big 12 road trips get picked up by TV, that
tells
you we have zero stroke with the networks.
Last season, 12 of Texas' 14 games were televised. So far this season, 5 of
8 have been televised. We're already worse off than last year with three
regular season games to go.
And don't bank on pay-per-view. The Big 12 contract with ABC doesn't allow
pay-per-view that would conflict with the ABC college telecasts.
* * * *
Coach Mack Brown said Monday the Longhorns are in for a terrific battle in
Lubbock Saturday night. He said the Raiders "run a no-huddle offense. They
might get 90 plays. We'd better have a bunch of guys ready to rush the
passer."
He said the Raiders throw on nearly every down, and he said the UT coaches
will play a lot of people on defense to try to keep fresh pass rushers in
the
game.
He also said the last three games of the season against Texas Tech  and
Kansas on the road and Texas A&M in Austin are all tough games. "I told the
players we could end up 6-5 or we could end up  9-2," he said. "I really
don't know."
Brown said the Longhorns are 5-5 in their last 10 trips to Lubbock. He is
0-1
in his one trip to Lubbock with the Longhorns because the Raiders took a
42-35 victory in 1998, the last time the Horns came to town. But Brown is
1-1
against the Raiders because Texas mauled Tech last year in Austin, 58-7.
Mike Leach, the Tech coach, was offensive coordinator at OU last year, and
Brown said, "Texas Tech runs the same offensive scheme that Oklahoma runs.
That should get our attention."
He said Raider QB Kliff Kingsbury "is one of the top quarterbacks in the
league and in the nation. He is much improved."
* * * *
It will be strength vs. strength when Kingsbury, the most prolific passer
in
Division I, throws against the Texas defense, which is No. 1 in the nation
in
pass efficiency with a very good 82.69 rating. The Longhorns also are 10th
in
passing yardage yielded, giving up just 168 yards per game.
* * * *
FOOTBALL RECRUITING  NOTES: The Longhorns are still at 19 commitments.
Super
safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple says he is pretty sure he will sign with
either Texas or Florida State. Super OL Jami Hightower of Jacksonville says
it is still a three-way race between Texas, A&M and Nebraska. He says he
plans to come to the Texas-A&M game.
* * * *
FOOTBALL NOTES: Roy Williams has caught passes for a UT freshman record 514
yards this year and B. J. Johnson is close behind him with 446. Williams
also
is the leading freshman receiver in the nation in terms of yardage gained.
Lovell Pinkney held the UT freshman record. He had 458 yards as a freshman
in
1992. Johnson needs just 13 yards to pass Pinkney. . . The Longhorns are a
10-point favorite over Texas Tech. . . Only 7 of the players on UT's 44-man
depth chart are seniors.

Barnes Hires New Assistant; Summer Football Camps Start Next Week

Texas basketball coach Rick Barnes announced Tuesday he has hired South=20

assistants.
The 35-year-old Haith, who joined coach Dave Odom's staff at South
Carolina=20
on April 16 after spending the past four seasons under Odom at Atlantic

Conference member Wake Forest, will begin his post at Texas immediately.

Haith assumes the post vacated by Lanier, who left the Texas coaching

While at Wake Forest, Haith was instrumental in leading the Demon Deacons
to=

four consecutive postseason tournament appearances, including an NCAA

"In Frank Haith, we have hired one of the top assistant coaches in the=20
nation,"  Barnes said.  "He came very highly recommended from many of
the=20
high school coaches in the state of Texas and around the nation.  Frank
also=
=20
brings a great deal of familiarity with coaching and recruiting in this
area=
=20
of the country.  There is no question that it is just a matter of time
befor=
e=20
he becomes a head coach at this level."
Prior to joining the staff at Wake Forest, Haith served one year as the=20
associate head coach at Texas A&M (1996-97).  He spent one season
(1995-96)=20
as an assistant coach at Penn State, helping the Nittany Lions to a

overall record.  During the year, Penn State was ranked as high as ninth
in=20
the national polls before placing second in the Big Ten Conference=20
regular-season standings and earning the school's first NCAA Tournament
bid=20
in 31 years.
"I am extremely excited about the opportunity to coach at The University
of=20
Texas," Haith said.  "There were two things that proved to be the key
factor=
s=20
in my decision to come to Austin.  One is the opportunity to work for
Rick=20
Barnes.  And second, having worked in College Station for four years, I
know=
=20
the potential that exists in Austin.  The Texas program is one that can
win=20
the National Championship."
* * * *
ILB Aaron Harris of Mesquite, RB Albert Hardy of Galena Park, DE Travis=20
Leitko of The Woodlands and C Bob Morton of McKinney have at least two
thing=

in common. They are the state's best players at their respective
positions=20
and they have already achieved qualifying scores on the SAT.
Morton is committed to Texas A&M. Hardy favors Texas very strongly, and=20
Harris and Leitko are considering several schools, including UT.
This is a year when many of the top junior recruits have awesome test
scores=
.=20
OL Josiah Vinson of Irving has a 1,500 SAT score and Leitko and Morton are
i=
n=20

Unfortunately, it's also a year when many of the super recruits will wind

Coach Mack Brown and his assistants might seem to be starting a little

 Longhorns Enter Fall Football Workouts
With Lofty Ranking, but Several Problem Areas

Coach Mack Brown, speaking at the annual Big 12 football coaches and media
meeting in Dallas Friday, cited "three primary areas of concern heading into
this season."
He also scoffed at pre-season polls, which have UT high in the top 10,
saying, "The only polls that matter are the ones at the end of the season."
Offensively, he said, "We do not have a tailback who stepped out (during the
spring) and showed he is ready to start."
On defense, Brown said, "Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers were great players at
defensive tackle last year. Casey was a first-round draft choice and Shaun
would have been if he had been healthy. Replacing them  is a real concern."
On special teams, he cited the departure of Kris Stockton, who handled all
the kicking duties last season, and said developing a good kicking game will
be a key to having a succesfful season.
The freshmen report next Monday (August 6) and the varsity on August 9 (a
full practice schedule is on page 3).
My view is that the first two problem areas he mentioned are minor ones
compared to the place-kicking woes.
In the spring, the tailbacks looked solid, if not spectacular, and, with
super recruit Cedric Benson coming in to bolster that spot, it shouldn't be a
lingering problem.
At defensive tackle, sophomore Marcus Tubbs started three games last season
when Rogers' sore ankle limited his availability, and he played extensively
in all 12 games.
Tubbs had 5.5 sacks and 10 other tackles for losses and showed great promise
for the future.
He and most of the other defensive tackles are smaller and quicker than
Hampton and Rogers, which should help the front four show a lot of
improvement in pass rushing.
The tackles this year won't be as good against the run as Hampton and Rogers,
who were run-stoppers deluxe, but they will be pretty good at it, and, lets
face it, the best teams on the UT regular-season schedule are geared to
passing.
So two of the three problem areas Brown cited probably can be handled without
much difficulty.
But let's hope some of the walk-on kickers the UT staff rounded up after the
spring problems surfaced can kick field goals.
If they can't, and if this team is as good as it has a chance to be, Brown
could find himself in the same boat as Florida State coach Bobby Bowden, who
lost a couple of national championships in the 1990s because he didn't have
guys who could make a chip-shot field goal when the game was on the line.
I haven't seen any of the walk-on kickers in action, so I'll report on them
in depth in my next newsletter. They are supposed to be pretty good, and they
will need to be.
Brown said the Longhorns will have more experience this year and that will
help the team.
"We've had a lot of participation in the voluntary workouts this summer,
probably the most we've had," he said. "There is more excitement and maturity
on the team and that's always a positive."
When asked if he thinks there is a lot of pressure on him this year, he said
he wants a job where there is pressure because that means people want to win,
but he said some folks are chronic gripers.
"My wife told me when we first got married 10 years ago that if you look at
the gripers that are negative people, they probably griped about the meal
they had for lunch, they didn't like the last movie they saw, and they're mad
at their wife before they get home. So they're just mad at me."
"I don't worry about those folks. I figure when you're selling 55,000 season
tickets and 66 luxury suites and you've sold out 13 straight at home,
somebody's happy."

I update my 900 number nearly every day with football and football recruiting
news. The number is 1-900-288-8839. It costs $1.59 a minute. You must be 18
or older to call.

My Big 12 Picks

I think this is the year the Big 12's Southern Division really becomes a
dominant force.
So, instead of picking the Southern and Northern Divisions, I'm going to pick
the way I think the Big 12 shapes up, from top to bottom, as a single entity.
Here goes:
1. Texas                7. Texas A&M
2. Oklahoma         8. Iowa State
3. Nebraska         9. Missouri
4. Kansas State     10. Oklahoma State
5. Colorado         11. Kansas
6. Texas Tech           12. Baylor
Obviously, the way I picked them means I think the winner of the
Texas-Oklahoma showdown in Dallas on Oct. 6 will win the whole thing.

Big 12 Coaches Give OU Edge

The Big 12 coaches picked Oklahoma to edge Texas in the South and Nebraska to
nose out Kansas State in the North.
Since they picked Texas last year and the Sooners won the national title,
let's hope what goes around comes around.
The vote was really close in the South, with the Sooners nipping the Horns,
6-5, with Texas coach Mack Brown abstaining.
Brown says he isn't going to get caught up in pre-season hype this year
because it doesn't make sense to try to predict how a team will do when it
hasn't even started practicing.
The media picked a pre-season All-Big 12 Team and it included four Longhorns
on the first team. They are senior OT Mike Williams, sophomore WR Roy
Williams, junior DE Cory Redding and senior CB Quentin Jammer.
Nebraska QB Eric Crouch was chosen the top pre-season offensive player and
Oklahoma LB Rocky Calmus won the defensive honors.

McClintock Undergoes Surgery

DE O. J. McClintock was released from the hospital Saturday after undergoing
emergency surgery Friday to repair what UT trainer Tom McVan said was
"significant damage to muscles and tendons in his right arm."
McClintock, a 6-2, 250-pound junior, said Sunday he suffered some pretty deep
cuts when a relative stumbled and he rammed his hand and arm through a window
trying to grab the relative and keep him from falling.
"I've got to do some rehabilitation for my hand," he said Sunday. "The
doctors told me I could start working out again in three or four weeks and,
if I miss any games, it shouldn't be more than the first one or two."
The Longhorns were already thin at defensive end, and they could be
critically short if McClintock is out for a significant period of time.
"It's very unfortunate that O. J. was injured," said head coach Mack Brown.
"He did a tremendous job making the transition to defensive end (from
linebacker) in the spring and is a guy we have high hopes for this season."
If McClintock's injury is serious enough to cause him to miss part of the
season, it will leave Texas with only senior Jermain Anderson and incoming
freshman Lance McFarland to back up starters Kalen Thornton and Cory Redding.
Another DE, Adam McConathy, was granted a release to transfer earlier. He
said he wanted to go to a school where he has a better chance to log some
playing time.
If the injury does cost McClintock significant playing time, the coaches will
make some moves to provide more depth. Incoming freshman Eric Hall, who had
been ticketed forfullback, would be a good candidate for a switch to
defensive end.

Mack Brown Notes, Quotes. .

Coach Mack Brown, speaking at the Big 12 coaches' meeting in Dallas Friday,
said the Longhorns "can be really, really good but we've got to do a better
job day to day and week to week. We had three games we let get away last
year. Our goal is always to win every game we play."
He also  said the coaches and players "are proud that our team is being
looked at" as one of the best in the country in the pre-season, but then he
said "pre-season rankings mean absolutely nothing. We have to go out and take
care of business."
He also downplayed expectations for heralded running back recruit Cedric
Benson, saying, "We're not sure if freshmen will be involved in major roles
as early as they have."
"Hopefully," he said, "we can let a freshman grow into it instead of just
throwing him out there."
But he also said the coaches plan to play the best players at each position.
If Benson lives up to all the hype and if none of the other tailbacks emerge
quickly, I think he'll play and play a lot early in the season.

Dollars and More Dollars

Texas and Nebraska far outdistance the other teams in the Big 12 when it
comes to raising and spending money.
The Collegiate Financial Service of Madison, Wis., compiles budget total
every year and here are the most recent ones for all 12 conference members:
1. Texas            $42,212,472
2. Nebraska             $41,206,201
3. Oklahoma         $27,463,682
4. Colorado             $27,293,883
5. Texas A&M        $26,091,278
6. Kansas               $22,211,690
7. Kansas State         $20,347,617
8. Texas Tech           $19,981,852
9. Missouri             $19,945,025
10. Oklahoma State      $18,862,474
11. Iowa State          $18,695,912
12. Baylor              $18,553,621

Horns Favored by 13; UT-Houston Game Set for 6 P.M. on Fox TV

The Longhorns are a 13-point favorite over Stanford for their 9:15 p.m.
(Texas time) game Saturday night in Palo Alto. The game will be televised
by
the Fox Network.
The Texas-Houston game in Austin Sept. 23 has been set for a 6 p.m. kickoff
and also will be televised by the Fox Network.
Coach Mack Brown said he is always happy when the Longhorns are on
television. "Our game last week was televised to 27 million people, and the
game Saturday at Stanford will be televised to areas with 48 million
people.
That's a lot of homes, from a recruiting standpoint," he said.
* * * *
Brown said he was pleased with the season-opening 52-10 victory over
Louisiana-Lafayette Saturday, but he also said the Horns need to work to
improve. "If we don't play better at Stanford than we did Saturday, we'll
get
beat," he said.
"We have a lot of work to do this week," he said. "We still have got to
work
a lot on our running game. Our line was very physical in its pass blocking.
We didn't give up a sack and we had great pass protection. We've just got
to
be more physical in our run blocking and our backs have to fight for the
extra yards."
He also said he was concerned because Louisiana-Lafayette hit some long
passes, "and that's Stanford's game. Stanford will beat us to death if we
don't stop the long ball."
"Stanford is averaging 494 yards offensively in two ball games," he said.
"Their quarterback, Randy Fasani, is No. 1 in into offense in the Pac 10
and
his No. 6 nationally. They throw the ball down field. We will get tested
deep
in a hurry."
Brown said Stanford starts eight seniors on defense, and he said OLB Riall
Johnson, 6-3, 240, "led the Pac 10 in sacks last year with 13."  He also
said
DT Willie Howard, 6-4, 298, "is a pre-season All-Pac-10 selection. Both of
them are really good. They will be about as good as anybody we play."
He also noted that Stanford is a fast-starting team. "They've scored 51
points, and 45 of them were in the first half," he said. "We'd better be
ready to play from the opening kickoff."
Brown said the freshmen wide receivers deserve all the accolades they are
getting, but he also said some other young players had good games Saturday.
He said sophomore Cole Pittman and true freshman Kalen Thornton both
"played
very strong games" at defensive end. He also praised senior  RB Hodges
Mitchell and said he was outstanding in pass blocking for the UT
quarterbacks.
He continued promoting the idea that Texas has two first-team quarterbacks,
but there is little doubt that Major Applewhite's outstanding game in
relief
of Chris Simms will have him taking the first snap at Palo Alto.
Brown said there were no injuries in the Louisiana-Lafayette game.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: DE Eric Hall, 6-3, 232, 4-5, of Clarksville, Tenn., took
his official visit to Texas last weekend and said he really enjoyed it. He
said Texas is his favorite right now, but said he wants to take some other
visits before committing to anyone. . .DE Kaelen Jakes, 6-4, 260, 4.8, of
Valencia HS in Placentia, Cal., says he is trying to set up an official
visit
to Texas for the Sept. 23 weekend. Jakes is playing nose guard this year
and
he said he had two sacks and several other tackles for losses in Valencia's
opening 24-0 victory over Palmdale Highland. He said Highland is supposed
to
have a playoff-caliber team "and we really shut them down." Jakes lived in
Plano when he was in junior high and he said he is strongly considering
coming to UT. "I really like the way football is king in Texas," he said. .
.
OL William Winston of Houston Madison said he also plans to come to Austin
for the Houston game, but that will be an unofficial visit. He said he is
considering so many schools that he probably will use his five official
visits to look at out-of-state schools like UCLA, Tennessee, Miami,
Wisconsin
and LSU, and will take unofficial visits to Texas and Texas A&M.
* * * *
IMPORTANT NOTICE: I won't have any more faxes this week because I am
heading
to California early to scout some of the players Texas is recruiting out
there and I won't be back until after the Stanford game.  My next fax
probably will be next Monday, Sept. 18.

UT Favored by 45; Brown Says He'll Name QB Just Before Kickoff

The Longhorns are 45-point favorites over Louisiana-Lafayette for
Saturday's
11:30 a.m. season opener in Austin. For those of you who don't live in
Austin
and who plan to come to the game, this is the hottest summer I have seen in
Austin, with temperatures hitting 105, 106 and 107 with disturbing
regularity, so I would advise you to wear something cool and arrange to
have
plenty of liquids to drink.
The team returned to practice Monday after getting three days off to
recuperate from 2-a-days, and freshman WR Roy Williams made a spectacular
catch of a ball that looked like it was over everyone.
Coach Mack Brown said he won't name a starting quarterback publicly until
the
game starts, and won't even break the news to Major Applewhite and Chris
Simms, the two quarterbacks who are competing for the starting job, until
Saturday morning. "We want to watch them in practice all week," Brown said.
He also said both QBs are working hard and competing for the starting job.
"We have told our team we have two starters," Brown said. "We are just
happy
they are both really good. In making these decisions, we will try to take
care of both of them and do what is best for the team."
All of the injured starters who missed some time last week were back at
practice Monday, but they didn't run with the first team. Brown said, "as
of
today," redshirt freshman Tillman Holloway would start at left guard
because
Derrick Dockery missed most of last week, sophomore Cole Pittman would
start
ahead of Cory Redding at DE because Redding was injured last week, and
Roderick Babers, who is locked in a battle with Ervis Hill, at CB, would
get
the nod because Hill missed some workouts with an injury.
But the game isn't today, and Brown said the players who were hurt will
have
an opportunity this week to regain their starting jobs.
Brown also said he hasn't decided whether to start any true freshmen, and
said he probably won't make a final decision on that until close to game
time, too, "because sometimes you tell a freshman he is going to start, and
he starts hyperventilating."
Whether or not they start, freshman WRs Williams and B. J. Johnson will
play
early and often. They are the most impressive freshmen wide receivers I
have
seen at Texas. Mike Adams and Lovell Pinkney were a very good pair, but
Williams and Johnson look better, and Sloan Thomas and Tony Jeffery, the
other two freshmen WRs, aren't too far behind. Defensive coordinator Carl
Reese also says freshman CB Nathan Vasher and freshman DE Kalen Thornton
will
play Saturday.
RECRUITING NOTES: Greg Barnum, the center from Killeen Ellison who left
Tennesse and considered transferring to Texas, enrolled at Stephen F.
Austin
and says he plans to stay there for the remainder of his career. . . DE
Eric
Hall of Clarksville, Tenn., says he is still planning to take his official
visit to Texas this weekend, and super DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison
heads the list of high school stars who plan to come to the UT game on
unofficial visits. . . Shreveport Evangel's 60-game winning streak ended
Saturday when Marrero Shaw took a 22-19 victory. Evangel QB Brett Rawls,
6-5,
200, completed 19 of 37 passes for 238 yards and three touchdowns in a
losing
effort. Rawls and Matt Nordgren, 6-5, 225, of Dallas Bishop Lynch, are UT's
top QB targets this recruiting season.
BASKETBALL RECRUITING  NOTES: The Longhorn women got a commitment Monday
from
the state's top prospect, Heather Schrieber, a  6-2 forward from
Windthrost,
a small town near Wichita Falls. Schrieber, who had offers from top schools
all over the country after a great summer season in AAU ball, had narrowed
her choices to Texas and Iowa State, and she visited the Cyclones last
weekend, then came home and called the Texas coaches to say she wants to
play
for the Longhorns. "I just really like Texas," she said. Joel Nelson of
Flower Mound, who coached her in AAU play this summer, said, "Heather is a
great player. She can bring the ball down court, she hit 46% of her
three-pointers for us and she was the best player on an AAU team that
finished fourth in the country. She could play guard, forward or center at
the college level and be very good at any of those positions. I know teams
like Texas Tech, Arkansas, Iowa State and several others wanted her, too. I
think she's the best player in the state." He said she averaged 18 points,
13
rebounds and 6 assists in a 60-game AAU season against top players from 4A
and 5A schools.
My next fax will be whenever events warrant.

Horns Get 2 Top Recruits

The Longhorns have 14 commitments after getting pledges from two top 100
national recruits since my last newsletter.
As expected, DE Chase Pittman, 6-5, 263, 4.7, of national powerhouse
Shreveport Evangel, committed to Texas during ceremonies at his church on
Sunday, September 16.
The other national top 100 pledge the Horns got recently was from LB Garnet
Smith, 6-3, 221, 4.54, of Arlington Lamar,  who first committed to Oklahoma
Monday, Sept. 17, then switched to Texas two days later and said he is solid
for the Longhorns.
The Longhorns are close to getting a commitment from Tyler DB Matthew Melton,
5-11, 190, 4.43, who is being highly recruited because he is big enoough to
play safety, fast enough to play corner, and, unlike many of the state's
other top DBs, is a full qualifier.
Tyler is 4-0 this season and is one of the state's top teams. Melton missed
one game with a sprained ankle, but he had 21 tackles and one interception in
the other two games prior to their game Saturday.
"I'm very close to committing to Texas," he said. "I'll probably do it in the
next month."
Pittman chose Texas over LSU at the end, but he was recruited by top schools
from all over the country.
He is the brother of Cole Pittman, the sophomore Longhorn DT who was killed
in a vehicle accident in February while returning to Texas for spring
football practice.
I went to Lufkin Friday night to watch Evangel play Lufkin, one of the top
teams in Texas. In last week's USA Today rankings, Lufkin, led by QB Reggie
McNeal, an A&M pledge, was rated No 4 in the country, and Evangel, led by
sophomore QB John David Booty, 6-3, 185, 4.5, and Pittman, was rated No. 20.
Evangel defeated Lufkin, 33-17, primarily because of Booty's throwing and a
stout defense led by Pittman. But Booty isn't the only stud sophomore on the
Evangel team.
DE Chris Bowers, 6-2, 230, 4.6, is a budding star on the side opposite
Pittman.
Lufkin ran away from Pittman's right DE spot all night, but he still had, by
my count, a sack, three QB pressures and eight tackles.
McNeal is a 10.3 sprinter, but Pittman twice came from the  far side to run
him out of bounds. He has outstanding speed and quickness and is on many
national top 100 teams.
Lufkin has an underclassman who will be a big man in recruiting circles next
year. He is TE-WR-QB Terrance Parks, 6-4, 220, 4.6. With McNeal struggling
early in the game, he moved to QB and brought Lufkin back from a 19-0
deficit. He, not McNeal, was named the Panthers' offensive player of the game.
Texas also is trying to sign Jonathan Wade, a 5-11, 170-pound cornerback at
Evangel. He has committed to Tennessee, but took an official visit to Texas
the weekend of the North Carolina game. He is the top sprinter in Louisiana.
With a 1,200-plus SAT, Smith said UT's academic superiority over OU was a big
factor.
Despite his early commitment to OU, Smith said. "I'm sure now. I am solid on
this. I definitely know where I want to go and it is Texas."
Smith said, "I want to go where I will be happy, and I feel like I will be
happy in Austin. The Texas people have said nothing but nice things to me,
even when I was committed to Oklahoma, but the OU people haven't been that
nice."
He also said he had never realized how much difference there is in the two
schools academically until he looked at an academic rating of colleges.
"Oklahoma just can't compare to Texas academically," he said.
Smith  said his head coach and several of his assistant coaches are Oklahoma
graduates and have been "pushing me to go to Oklahoma."
Smith is the closest thing out there this year to sensational UT freshman LB
Derrick Johnson.
If Smith's commitment holds up, look for Johnson and Smith to be outstanding
outside backers, one on the weakside and one on the strongside, for years to
come at UT.

Game Quotes . .
"We had some unfortunate things happen to us right at the end of the first
half, and then we had the good drive to start the second half and fumbled
inside the Texas' 25 when we had a chance to retake the lead. We had our
chances, but we weren't able to execute."
- Houston head coach Dana Dimel
* * * *
"Gosh, we really missed a lot of tackles. We just didn't play well at all on
defense. I may have them out there practicing tomorrow (Sunday). That's how
concerned I am. We have to tackle better than that to do the things we want
to do this year."
- Texas defensive coordinator Carl Reese
* * * *
"Houston played some good football early in the game, but we just had to keep
fighting. On the long one, I just faked in and cut outside and I was wide
open and Chris (Simms) dropped it right in there."
- UT WR B. J. Johnson, who had a 92-yard TD reception and 124 yards on four
catches
* * * *
"I got some great blocking and I just tried to run hard on every carry. It
felt great to go over 100 yards. I felt like we were able to pound on them
and wear them down in the second half. We also were able to get a lot of
balance on offense."
- Longhorn RB Ivan Williams, who became the first UT back to gain 100 yards
rushing this year with 19 carries for 104 yards and a touchdown
* * * *
"Those 10 points in the last eight seconds of the first half really gave us a
lift. I love to play smash-mouth football with a big back and that's whaqt we
had tonight with Ivan (Williams)."
- Texas' senior OT Mike Williams
* * * *
"We had to fight through a lot of adversity in the first half, but we took
the lead and the momentum back when we scored twice at the end of the first
half. I think this was the best offensive game we've had this year."
- UT QB Chris Simms, who passed for 311 yards and three touchdowns
* * * *
"Their receivers made some phenomenal catches and they all have some great
moves to go with their speed. We busted some coverages, and you can't do that
and survive against receivers like Texas has."
- Houston CB Jason Parker
* * * *
"That was a crucial mistake on my part. I was trying to get through the pile
and get the first down and somebody's helmet hit the ball and it popped out.
We hit some big plays on their defense, but they came up with a big hit on
that one."

plunge inside the Texas' 30 on Houston's last chance to take the lead again

Scouting Texas Tech

The Longhorns open Big 12 play Saturday at 6 p.m. in Austin against a
dangerous Texas Tech team that is 2-0 after opening with a 42-30 triumph over
News Mexico  and then hammering North Texas, 42-14, Saturday.
QB Kliff Kingsbury is the Big 12's leading passer with 65 completions in 95
attemps (68.4%) for 650 yards, an average of 325 per game. He has thrown 5 TD
passes with two interceptions.
UT QB Chris Simms has completed 54 of 103 passes (52.4%) for 660 yards, an
average of 220 a game. He has had five touchdown passes and allowed one
interception.
The Raiders also have a better running game than they did last year, with TB
Ricky Williams averaging 4.5 yards a carry and 74.5 yards per game.
  Williams also is Kingsbury's favorite target, leading the Big 12 with an
average of 10 receptions and 95 yards per game receiving.
Texas coach Mack Brown said the Longhorn defense has to put pressure on
Kingsbury and has to tackle better than it did against Houston.
At 5-8 and 195 pounds and with blazing speed and outstanding moves, Williams
has proven he is a difficult man to corral. How the UT defense copes with his
dual threat will be a major key in determing who wins the game.
Kingsbury's other favorite target is speedy redshirt freshman Nehemia Glover,
who is averaging 5.5 catches for 63.5 yards per game.
Tech head coach Mike Leach loves the short passing game. He was the offensive
coordinator at Oklahoma in 1999 before taking the Tech job, so the Longhorns'
next two opponents run very similar offenses.
How the Longhorns defend against Tech will provide an advance hint about how
they will do against the Sooners.
To win, the Longhorns must:
1. Tackle much better than against Houston.
2. Defend against misdirection much better than they have all season.
3. Win or get a push in the turnover battle.
4. Be able to run and pass effectively.
The Raiders have only four returning starters on defense, but one of them is
strong safety Kevin Curtis, one of the Big 12's top players.

Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):

DE Chase Pittman, 6-5, 265, 4.7, Shreveport Evangel (UT, LSU)

Recruiting Roundup

The Longhorns still have 12 commitments, and I think they will get another
one Sunday when outstanding DE Chase Pittman attends church services at
Shreveport Evangel.
It is a tradition at Evangel that recruits announce their college plans to
the congregation.
Pittman might commit to LSU instead of Texas, but I think he is going to be a
Longhorn.
He and his parents were in Austin over the weekend and participated in
pre-game ceremonies honoring the memory of his brother, Cole, who was killed
in a traffic accident in February while returning to UT for spring football
practice.
He visited LSU the previous week and has narrowed his choices to the
Longhorns and Bayou Bengals.
While Pittman was not on an official visit (he and his parents paid their own
way), his teammate, speedy DB Jonathan Wade, 5-11, 185, 4.3, was on an
official visit.
Wade, a 10.3 sprinter, committed to Tennessee several weeks ago, but he must
be having second thoughts. He says he remains firmly committede to the
Volunteers, but you know what I have always said about kids who keep on
visiting after they commit.
In case you are a new subscriber, I say that is akin to keeping on dating
after you become engaged, which makes marriage rather doubtful.
WR Marquis Johnson of Champaign, Ill., has not made it to a Texas game, as he
had planned to do, but he says the Longhorns still are his No. 1 choice.
He does say he has changed his mind about committing early and wants to look
around a little.
LB Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar is the closest thing I've seen  this year
to super Longhorn freshman Derrick Johnson.
He told me Sunday he probably will announce his college choice right after he
attends the Texas-Oklahoma game.
He leans the Longhorns' way pretty strongly, but I think he might swing the
other way if the Sooners win that game.
"I really like Texas, but I want to see how those teams look when they play
each other," he said.
If the Longhorns can sign Smith and Aaron Harris, the stud middle backer at
North Mesquite, they will be a lot better at linebacker in future years when
they team with the young guys already on campus.

Part 2 of 3 Parts

Spring Football Notes . .

QB Chris Simms completed 11 of 15 passes for 174 yards and a touchdown to
highlight UT's annual Orange-White game before a crowd school officials
estimated at 31,000
Coach Mack Brown had the first team offenses and defenses square off agains=
t
each other for the first time in the Orange-White game.
The only touchdown the first-team defense gave up was a 53-yard Simms pass =
to
WR Roy Williams, who had a step on CB Quentin Jammer.
Simms also led the offense to a field goal.
QB Major Applewhite, operating behind an offensive line patched with
walk-ons, led the second team to one touchdown against the second-team
defense, on a fade route to WR Sloan Thomas in the end zone.
My vote for most improved offensive player this spring is split three ways
because Simms, sophomore TE Brock Edwards and senior tackle Mike Williams a=
re
all much improved over last year. On defense, I think it's a two-way tie
between DT Marcus Tubbs and CB/safety Nathan Vasher.
I think the Longhorns will have the best group of WRs, TEs and DBs in the B=
ig
12. They will have the best passing QB in the Big 12, too, if Simms continu=
es
to improve. They also will have one of the two or three best pass-blocking
lines in the league if they stay healthy.

Maroon-Hued Journalists Abound

I should have commented on this earlier, but better late than never.
Kevin Sherrington of the Dallas News wrote a love-in column about Texas A&M
coach R. C. Slocum right after national signing day, and both Slocum and
Sherrington used the opportunity to throw a few rocks at Texas coach Mack
Brown and the Longhorns
I'm going to quote a couple of excerpts from the column, with my comments
about them. Here's the first one:
"Such is R.C. Slocum's life these days. Never had a losing season at Texas
A&M. Won more games than any coach in school history. Run a clean program h=
is
dozen years as head coach."
Clean program? No question it's cleaner than it used to be, but Sherrington
must have a really short memory. Remember those no-show jobs?
Then Sherrington and Slocum got into recruiting, and both took some shots a=
t
Brown and UT. Here's what they said in the column:
"Of course, rankings come with caveats, too, Slocum reminded. After four
years of enrolling the country's top recruiting classes, he asked, 'shouldn=
't
a school have the most talented team in the country? Shouldn't expectations
go way up?' "
" 'Wouldn't that be accurate?' Slocum asked."
"In other words, you're up, Mr. Brown."
First of all, Brown hasn't had "four years of enrolling the country's top
recruiting classes." He's had three of them, and the third class hasn't eve=
n
enrolled yet. The other two were freshmen and sophomores last year and they
are the heart and soul of the team.
Brown's first signees at Texas weren't in the class of the others, which
certainly were highly ranked classes.
His first great class will be starting its third year this season and it is
ready to boost the Longhorns back into national prominence.
The Aggies, on the other hand, went 11-3 in 1998, 8-4 in 1999 and 7-4 in
2000. Sounds like a downward spiral to me. I wonder if Aggies' expectations
are "way up?"
Second, the last time I looked, Texas and Texas A&M had played three times
since Brown arrived to find Slocum firmly entrenched at A&M with his progra=
m
already well established.
Enheriting a 4-7 team, Brown has produced three consecutive nine-win season=
s
and, while I know it sounds far-fetched after reading the remarks of
Sherrington and Slocum, he has a 2-1 edge over Slocum and his Aggies.
The lone Aggie victory over Brown was in 1999 at A&M by a razor-thin 20-16
margin when UT QB Major Applewhite, the Big 12 Co-Offensive Player of the
Year, was too sick to play.
I know you play with what you have and I am not saying that Aggie victory
shouldn't count, but what I am saying is that any outsider reading the colu=
mn
would think the Aggies must be hammering us every year.
While I'm on the subject of biased reporting, I thought it was interesting
that the Houston Chronicle published a three-column bylined story on the
Texas A&M spring game, which drew 6,000 fans. The paper did not staff the U=
T
spring game and did not run one line on an event that was attended by 31,00=
0
fans.
The UT Sports Information Department distributed a lengthy story on the
spring game and many papers used all or part of it, but the Chronicle simpl=
y
ignored the entire event.
The Chronicle has one sports columnist, devout Aggie John Lopez, who doesn'=
t
even try to get his facts straight when writing, about Texas.
Remember his column on how UT basketball guard Darren Kelly wanted to go to
A&M, but didn't have the grades.
Kelly was a full qualifier out of high school and, in fact, started his
college career at a Division I school before switching to a JC.
When he missed a semester at Texas for academic problems, it was because ma=
ny
of his hours at the small JC he attended did not transfer and he was short =
on
hours toward his degree. It wan't because he was failing any courses.
But Lopez was more interested in making excuses for the dismal Aggie
basketball team than he was in getting the facts straight.
If you get as irritated as I do with columnists who continue to glorify the
Aggies and ignore or put down the Longhorns, let the sports editors and/or
their bosses know about it.

An Early Look at the Schedule

Trying to predict football games in April that are several months away is a
dangerous business, so I'm going to just look at the schedule and talk abou=
t
the likely odds on all the games.
The Longhorns probably will be at least 15-point favorites over five of the=
ir
foes. They are the home games against New Mexico State and Kansas and the
road games against Houston, Oklahoma State and Baylor.
Texas also will be favored, probably by  at least 10 points, in the home g
ames against North Carolina and Texas Tech and the game at Missouri.
That leaves the Oct. 6 date in Dallas against defending national champion
Oklahoma, the Oct. 20 home game against Colorado and the Nov. 23 visit to A=
&M
as the ones that would appear to be the most dangerous.
I think Colorado will be a dangerous team if RB Marcus Houston stays health=
y,
and A&M is always dangerous in College Station.
But there is no question that the Sooners are the most dangerous looking fo=
e
on the schedule.
I won't predict Texas will win every game, but I will predict if the
Longhorns average 100 yards rushing against OU, Colorado and A&M, we'll all
be smiling heading into the post season.

Conradt Gives Up AD Title

Jody Conradt, UT women's basketball coach since 1976 and women's athletic
director since 1992, is going back to coaching full time and giving up the =
AD
post
"I have appreciated the opportunity to serve the university, but my heart a=
nd
my passion are about coaching women's athletics," she said.
Conradt, 59, said she thinks her basketball program is making "significant
progress" toward returning to the national spotlight and said she wants to
devote full time to that job.
Chris Plonsky, 43, a senior associate athletic director in the men's
department, will serve as women's athletic director on an interim basis and
will get a new title: senior associate athletic director for men's and
women's athletics.
Patricia Ohlendorf, UT vice president for institutional relations and legal
affairs, oversees both athletic departments. She said she will chair a smal=
l
committee that will study the men's and women's athletic departments to
determine their future course.
The study probably will take about two  months to complete, and all signs
point to a recommendation to combine the two departments.
Only five Division I universities have separate athletic departments for me=
n
and women. The others are Tennessee, Arkansas, Minnesota and Wisconsin.
In recent years, the two departments have combined to operate together in
several areas at Texas, such as sports medicine, strength and conditioning,
fund-raising and development, marketing, ticket operations and media
relations.
Sources close to the situation at UT say combining the two departments and
having one director to oversee both would save more than $1 million a year.
The sources also say UT President Larry Faulkner, who will make the ultimat=
e
call, favors combining the two departments.
In this day of increasing expenses and tight budgets, it would make a lot o=
f
sense to join the other 11 schools in the Big 12 and the vast majority of t=
he
other Division I schools in combining the two departments under one athleti=
c
director.
It would eliminate a lot of duplication and save a lot of money.

Jamboree on TV in Austin

The Longhorns Spring Football Jamboree, highlighted by the Orange-White gam=
e,
will be telecast by time Warner Cable Monday and Tuesday on Austin Cable
Channel 62.
Fox  Sports and Time Warner Cable are teaming up to bring Austin cable
viewers the tape-delay broadcast of the March 31 jamboree and scrimmage.
It will be telecast Monday (April 9) at 9 p.m. and Tuesday (April 10) at 7
p.m.

Umpire Boycott Silly

The three Austin-area umpires who are boycotting non-conference baseball
games at Texas' Disch-Falk Field because of what they term insulting person=
al
attacks by Longhorns assistant coaches are being silly.
David Wiley, Tim Henderson and Wade Ford say they won't call Texas'
non-conference games the rest of the season because they are unhappy with t=
he
way they have been treated by UT assistants Frank Anderson and Tommy Harmon=
.
"Tim, Wade and I have just decided it might be better for all parties
involved if we worked elsewhere this year because the professional climate
has deteriorated all year, such that we felt it would be better for us to
extract ourselves from that situation," Wiley said.
Henderson and Wade were assigned before the season to work some Big 12 game=
s
at Disch-Falk and said they will honor that commitment.
The reason the boycott is silly is that umpires have the ultimate weapon in
disputes with coaches. They can eject them, and that would be a far more
reasonable approach than what Wiley, Henderson and Ford have chosen to do.
A few ejections will make any coach see the light, even if he is in the
right, because umpires have dictatorial power over coaches.
It's also strange that Wiley is talking about it to reporters. The Big 12 h=
as
a strict gag rule on all Big 12 coaches, and Wiley knows he can say anythin=
g
he wants to without fear of contradiction from the other parties involved.

Baby,

You're so sweet for emailing me and saying such sweet things!  Do you know
that you brightened up my day?

I only have about 30 hours of school left.  I did okay on my test.  I should
have studied a little more, but I just didn't feel like it.  I'm feeling
comfortable about my project due tomorrow.  I find out tomorrow if I have to
take my optional final because I get my grade pre-final.  I don't know if I
should take the final if I have a B in the class.  I guess I'll figure it
out!

I slept a lot last night - almost 7.5 hours.  So, I feel more up to the
challenge of the next 2 days.  I'm also not as cranky!

I'm gonna send out a lot of the announcements today.  Mom emailed me the
rest of the addresses today, so I'll either do the rest tonight or tomorrow.

I'm going to tell Mom that I'm going to Houston this weekend.  I decided
that I should tell her since I may sign a lease next week.

Anyway, I've gotta continue on my project!

Love you,
Jenn

 Defense, Vasher-Led Special Teams Bail Out
Anemic Offense in 44-14 Win Over Tar Heels

The Longhorns have two-thirds of an outstanding team  as they showed Saturday
before another sellout home crowd in a 44-14 rout of North Carolina.
Coach Mack Brown's defense and special teams, led by Nathan Vasher's
school-record punt returns, were simply too much for Brown's old team.
But be thankful it wasn't a powerhouse across the line of scrimmage Saturday.
The Tar Heels might have the second-best defense the Longhorns will see this
year, but their offense is as bad as their defense is good.
The Texas offense, after two games, simply isn't hitting on all cylinders.
There are way too many three-and-outs and way too many drives that end almost
as soon as they start.
To stay in the top 5, or even in the top 10, the Longhorns must develop an
offense that moves the ball on most possessions, even when it fails to score.
An offense like that pays huge dividends in two ways. First, it helps win the
all-important field position battle. Second, it gives a team's defense time
to rest.
But this game, while it was a nail-biter for a half, turned into a runaway
primarily because of the tough UT defense, Vasher, DE Cory Redding and the
find of the year - freshman walk-on kicker Dusty Mangum.
The Longhorn defense held North Carolina to 211 yards total offense and
Redding scored the game's first touchdown on a 22-yard pass interception
return that included an awesome dive into the end zone to avoid two tacklers.
Vasher broke a 96-game Longhorn drought in touchdown punt returns, set up
another easy TD with a 59-yard punt return to the Tar Heel 5 and  kept the
crowd on its feet regularly with exciting punt returns. He also gift-wrapped
a touchdown for North Carolina when he bobbled a bouncing punt at the UT 17.
Mangum, the gritty young kicker from Mesquite, booted a 49-yard field goal
into the wind on the last play of the first half to send the Longhorns into
the dressing room with a 20-14 lead and some momentum.
He later kicked a 51-yarder and a 36-yarder and is perfect this season on
eight extra points and five field goals. Not bad for a walk-on.
Coach Brown said after the game a 30-point victory is to be enjoyed not
critiqued, but the Longhorns need to use this open date to figure out a way
to run the ball better and be more consistent on offense. A bunch of
three-and-outs in a row will get them beat pretty soon if they don't.

Here, briefly, is how the game went

First Quarter
Texas won the toss and deferred. Just like last week, that decision paid off
because most of the first quarter was played in North Carolina territory.
After an exchange of punts, Tar Heel QB Ronald Curry's pass in the right flat
was intercepted at the 22 by Redding, who ran it back to about the 5 and then
leaped over two would-be tacklers into the end zone. Mangum kicked the extra
point to give UT a 7-0 lead with 10:04 left. The Longhorn defense forced
another quick punt and Vasher got loose on a 59-yard punt return to the 5. He
almost scored but lost his balance tip-tooeing down the sideline after
leaping over one Tar Heel. An offside penalty moved it inside the 3. TB
Victor Ike ran to the 1, then QB Chris Simms scored. Mangum kicked the extra
point for a 14-0 lead with 6:45 left. The Longhorns had no first downs at
this point. After the kickoff,  Curry led the Tar Heels on an impressive
77-yard scoring drive to cut the deficit to 14-7 with 3:44 left. The Lo
nghorns ran only nine plays and had just 17 yards offensively in the quarter,
while North Carolina ran 23 plays and had 105 yards offensively.

Second Quarter
Vasher tried to scoop up a low bouncing punt at the UT 17 early in the period
and North Carolina scored in two plays to tie at 14-14 with 12:40 left. He
came right back with a 31-yard return to the Tar Heel 18. Three plays later
the Longhorns were on the 19, facing fourth-and-11, so Mangum kicked a
36-yard field goal for a 17-14 lead with 5:48 left. Simms led the Horns on a
51-yard drive in the final 45 seconds, connecting on four passes for 46 yards
to set up Mangum's clutch 49-yard FG into the wind on the final play for a
20-14 lead at the half. The Longhorns had 122 offensive yards in the period
to the Tar Heels' 54.

Third Quarter
UT went 3-and-out to start the second half, and the Tar Heels went deep on
their first play after the punt, but CB Quentin Jammer, after being burned on
a couple of long passes in the first half, made a lunging interection at the
UT 14. After an exchange of punts, UT put together its only long TD drive,
going 89 yards in 12 plays to take a 26-14 lead with 2:25 left. Simms tried
to pass for the two-point conversion, but it failed. RB Ivan Williams had a
31-yard run and Simms completed four passes for 31 yards. Freshman RB Cedric
Benson got the score on a 7-yard run. Texas had 121 offensive yards in the
quarter and the Longhorn defense gave the Tar Heels fits, allowing them to
run only seven plays for minus 5 yards.

Fourth Quarter
Mangum's 51-yard field goal to start the fourth quarter gave Texas a 29-14
lead. Then the UT kickoff team forced the Tar Heels to start their next
possession at the NC 5. Curry tried to pass on first down and DT Maurice
Gordon sacked him in the end zone for a safety and a 31-14 lead just 27
seconds deep in the quarter. Vasher's 44-yard punt return for a touchdown
with 9:06 left put UT on top, 38-14. Longhorn LB Reed Boyd's interception at
the North Carolina 14 set up TB Brett Robin's 12-yard TD run with 36 seconds
left, then backup QB Major Applewhite took a knee on the extra-point play,
leaving the score at 44-14 to honor Cole Pittman, the UT player who was
killed in a vehicle accident in February.

Pittman Ceremony

The Longhorns gave Cole Pittman's family an honorary T-Ring before the game
Saturday. In a tradition started nearly 50 years ago by Darrell Royal,
T-Rings are presented to every Longhorn football player who graduates.
Pittman was killed in an automobile accident last February while returning to
UT for spring football practice. He was a junior defensive tackle.
When the Longhorns scored late in the game to reach the 44-point plateau,
redshirt freshman quarterback Chance Mock, who was Pittman's best friend on
the team, told coach Mack Brown the score matched Pittman's jersey number.
Texas did not try to kick the extra point after the score, electing to take a
knee to preserve the final score in Pittman's honor.

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday he wants the Longhorn offense to develop more
consistency, but he also said he isn't worried about much of anything when
his team posts a 44-14 win.
"We're stressing the team, not individuals and stats, this year," he said.
"I'm not into statistics, how much we run it,  or how much we throw it."
"I'm not as concerned about all that as I am about is time of possession, the
number of plays we have as compared to them, the kicking game and turnovers."
But he said, "We haven't had as many explosive runs or passes as I would like
to see."
The UT staff defines explosive plays as runs of 12 yards or more and passes
of 16 yards or more.
In two games this season, both lop-sided victories, the Longhorns have run
the ball 80 times and they have had only six runs of 12 yards or more. They
have thrown 75 passes and have completed six of 16 yards or more.
Brown said the Longhorns have been very conservative offensively and have
forced the run in situations where the defensive formation normally would
cause a pass to be called.
"We're still not clicking on offense all the time," he said, but said one
reason "is we're forcing the run some now in situations that we probably
won't later in the year."
He said he wants the team to be able to run the ball when it wants to run it
at times because a solid running game is necessary to pick up short-yardage
first downs, keep some pressure off the quarterback and run the clock to
protect a lead late in the game.
But, as a whole, Brown said he was very happy with the victory over his
former school.
"After studying the film, I'm really pleased about almost everything. There
are still a lot of things we can improve but nearly everything was positive."
"The special teams were very exciting and really helped us win the game, but
(the fumbled punt) gave them a touchdown," he said. "We've got some things to
work on."
Brown said the offense "had 326 yards against them and they were giving up
only 255 yards a game against Oklahoma and Maryland. The Carolina defensive
line is very good. I think they have six or seven pro prospects on their
defense."
True freshmen LB Derrick Johnson led the team in tackles and had two sacks,
and Brown said he "has the ability to play as good as anybody in the country.
He's tall, he's fast and he likes to hit. I think he's got a chance to be
really special."

Sooners Still Outlaws

I normally don't write a lot about the other teams in the Big 12 unless I am
previewing their games with Texas.
But the University of Oklahoma issued an interesting press release about 10
days ago. Here's how it went, in part:
"Lynn McGruder, who began his college football career at Tennessee, is
enrolled at Oklahoma, University of Oklahoma athletic officials said today.
According to head football coach Bob Stoops, McGruder has yet to join the
football program."
"Stoops said that McGruder is not practicing or participating in any football
team activities and will not be until a past off-the-field incident is
resolved."
"OU expects its student-athletes to represent the best values of the
university both on and off the field," Stoops said. "We have set very high
standards of excellence, and we are not going to compromise them in any way."
"Our process of evaluating Lynn McGruder has included intensive conversations
with him and members of his family and those who worked with him in previous
athletic programs."
"While we have not yet made a final decision about whether or not he will
ultimately be allowed to participate in our football program," Stoops
continued, "we believe in looking at the whole character and background of a
person in deciding whether or not he deserves a second chance.  We recognize
that it is only human to make an isolated mistake and the important thing is
whether or not we learn from that mistake.  If we end up deciding that he
will join our football program, we will hold him very strictly to the highest
standards of behavior.  Not a single deviation from that standard will be
tolerated."
That's what the press release said, and, coming from OU, I guess I shouldn't
be that surprised.
McGruder was kicked off the Tennessee team after he was charged with felony
possession of marijuana with the intent to sell and deliver.
The charge said there were marijuana plants, a scale and other things the
police report described as drug-related material in his room.
Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer sometimes gives scholarships to kids other
schools won't touch.
 Do you remember the offensive lineman a couple of years ago who was charged
with raping a student at Florida while he was on a recruiting visit to the
school? Florida dropped him, but Fulmer signed him.
In other words, when Fulmer boots a kid for character reasons, you know
something is really wrong.
The odd thing about Stoops taking him is that, if convicted, he might do some
serious prison time.
Stoops didn't say whether McGruder is on scholarship, but I think he would
have stressed that he was walking on if that was the case.
I wonder what parents of top recruits will think of Stoops' decision.
Perhaps he can tell them that, if their sons come to Oklahoma and want to buy
some dope, at least they won't have to leave the athletic dorm to get it.
We shouldn't be surprised. After all, the original Sooners were the crooks
who cheated on the land rush back in 1899. They didn't participate in the
rush, but hid out along the way and grabbed choice pieces of property.
That's kind of like the marathon runners who get caught hitching a car ride
part of the way.
Of course those runners get disqualified and don't get the race named after
them they way the Sooners did. Oklahoma is, after all, the Sooner State.

Corrections

* I wrote in a recent newsletter that the University Interscholastic League
(UIL), the governing body for high school sports in Texas, had a rule against
recruits taking paid visits to colleges while they had eligibility remaining.
That rule was repealed five years ago and there is no such rule now.
* I wrote in my last issue that Victor Ike and Ivan Williams ran behind the
first-team line and Cedric Benson ran behind the defensive line. That should
have been the second-team line.

Longhorns Bury Cougars, 53-26,Get Ready
For Tough Big 12 Opener Against Texas Tech

Texas was a 31-point favorite at Houston Saturday night, but the Cougars were
primed for an upset until a Longhorn stampede in the final eight seconds of
the first half and the first few minutes of the second half buried their
chances.
The Longhorns took a 53-26 victory to run their record to 3-0  heading into a
tough Big 12 opener against Texas Tech this week, but they were fighting for
their lives in the first half and early in the second half before blowing the
game open.
QB Chris Simms passed for 311 yards and three touchdowns, WR B. J. Johnson
had four catches for 124 yards and a TD and RB Ivan Williams rushed for 103
yards and two more scores to spark the prolific Longhorn offense.
But the Longhorns needed their best offensive showing of the year because the
usually reliable UT defense had its worst game of the season.
The statistics in this game were like some of those in the old run-and-shoot
days. Texas averaged 7 yards per snap, and Houston was right behind at 6.9
yards per play.
The defensive play was so spotty that defensive coordinator Carl Reese
threatened to make his players practice Sunday.
The defense did have some sparking moments, stopping Houston on two crucial
fourth-down plays, and setting up a Longhorn touchdown with Nathan Vasher's
pass interception deep in Houston territory.
But it also gave up lots of big plays and allowed the Cougars to run and pass
far too effectively for most of the game.
The main culprit was missed tackles, but the Longhorn defenders also were
victimized repeatedly by misdirection plays, which is not a good sign with
two unbeaten teams - Texas Tech and Oklahoma - coming up in the next two
weeks. Both teams love misdirection plays and, after watching the way the
Horns played Saturday night, they will be finding even more misdirection
plays to use.
Here, briefly, is how the game went
First Quarter
The Longhorns scored on their first two possessions, driving 56 yards after
the kickoff to set up  a 41-yard field goal by freshman walkon Dusty Mangum
for a 3-0 lead with 9:52 left then hitting a big one with Simms and Johnson
combining on a 92-yard pass-and-run play. Mangum's kick made it 10-0 with
7:47 left. Houston came back with a 60-yard scoring drive to cut the
Longhorns' lead to 10-7 at the end of the quarter. Simms barely overthrew
wide-open WR Roy Williams on a near-miss for what would have been another UT
touchdown.
Second Quarter
Texas couldn't move on its first drive and Simms threw an interception on the
second. The Cougars drove 53 yards after the interception, taking a 14-10
lead on a deflected three-yard pass with just 1:19 left. The Horns came back
with a quick 60-yard scoring drive. Simms completed passes of 20 yards to WR
Tony Jeffery and 14 to Williams before hitting Jeffery for the final 17 yards
and, with Mangum's kick, a 17-14 lead with just eight seconds left. The
Cougars couldn't handle a bouncing kickoff and the Horns recovered at the 30
with four seconds left. Mangum kicked a 47-yard field goal on the last play.
At the half, Texas had 265 yards offensively and the Cougars had 197. The
Longhorns had the lone turnover, however, and that led to one UH score.
Third Quarter
Houston started the half with a drive deep into Texas' territory, but QB
Kelly Robertson fumbled on a fourth-down plunge and Texas recovered at the
27, then drove 73 yards for a TD to take a two-touchdown lead on Ivan
Williams' 1-yard run at 26-14 with 8:50 left. A two-point conversion try faile
d. The Cougars gambled again on fourth down on their next possession.
Compounding the problem, they were on their own 44. DE Cory Redding slammed
Robertson to the turf for no gain, and the Horns covered that distance in
seven plays, with Williams again scoring from the 1. Mangum's kick made it
33-14 with 1:59 left. Vasher's interception on UH's next possession again
gave the offense a short field at the Houston 25. Ivan Williams carried twice
for 19 yards and Simms hit Roy Williams for 5 yards to reach the UH 1 as the
quarter ended.
Fourth Quarter
Simms hit TE Brock Edwards with a 1-yard scoring pass on the first play of
the quarter and Mangum's kick gave Texas a 40-14 lead. Mangum missed a
36-yard field goal on UT's next possession. It was his first miss as a
Longhorn after seven
straight successful field goals. Moments later, UH WR Brandon Middleton got
away from the Longhorn defenders and was in the clear by 15 yards when
Robertson floated a pass to him. He loped the rest of the way to complate an
80-yard scoring play, and drew an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for
taunting his pursuers. Houston's try for a 2-point conversion failed, leaving
UT on top, 40-20, with 9:53 left. DE Kalen Thornton sacked Robertson at the
UH 14 on the Cougars' next possession, forcing a fumble. LB De'Andre Lewis
covered the fumble and backup QB Major Applewhite hit TE Bo Scaife for three
yards and a touchdown three plays later. Mangum's kick gave Texas a 47-20
lead with 5:21 left. Houston came right back with a 4-play, 75-yard drive to
score again, leaving Texas ahead, 47-26. On the Horns' last possession,
freshman TB Cedric Benson carried four times for 33 yards, including a 2-yard
TD plunge to run the final score to 53-26.

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown wanted some explosive offensive plays and he got them in
spades Saturday night in Houston.
But so did the Houston Cougars, which made the 31-point favorite Longhorns
sweat for quite a while before pulling away.
Last week, he was worried about the dearth of big offensive plays. This week,
he's tickled with his offensive production and worried sick about his defense.
"We got complacent on defense," he said. "We just stood there at times.
Offensively, we played really, really well. We had good balance between the
run and pass, we had 11 big plays, five in the passing game and six in the
running game."
"But the negative part is they (Houston) had nine big plays. It's a good
thing we had great offensive production because we would not have without it
because our defense did not play well enough to play anybody left on our
schedule."
"We've got to get better than that defensively to have a chance to beat Tech
this weekend. We've got to get right to work on improving defensively."
On the positive said, Brown said, "We are excited to be 3-0. It equals our
best start since 1994. Houston played about as good as they can play, and
they played as hard as they could possibly play."
"I thought the momentum changer was scoring 10 points in the final 10 seconds
of the first half to go up 20-14," he said. "then we totally dominated the
third quarter, scoring on every possession."
The Longhorns only had two possessions in the third quarter and they scored
touchdowns on each of them.
There was another momentum changer early in the third quarter when Houston
took the second-half kickoff and drove to the UT 26. Facing a
fourth-and-inches and trailing 20-14, the Cougars went for it.
QB Kelly Robertson tried a sneak and he might have made it, but a Longhorn
got a helmet on the ball and it shot back to the 27, where the Horns
recovered. Texas promptly drove for another TD and a 12-point lead and the
rout was on.
"That was a big play, too," Brown said. "The defense did have some stops, and
that was a key one."
But he said he said the Longhorns' overall performance defensively was just
unacceptable.
"We tackled very, very poorly," he said. "I think our defense has just been
bragged on so much, and we shut them out last year, that I don't know if our
guys showed them much respect."
Getting back to the good news, Brown said the team didn't suffer any serious
injuries and he was glad to get TEs Bo Scaife and Brock Edwards more involved
in the offense.
He noted that both have played very little because of injuries, and he said
both are very talented players who need to be involved in the Longhorns
offense to make it more effective.

Game Notes . .

* The Longhorns did not have a three-and-out possession Saturday night. They
only punted twice in 14 possessions and they made at least one first down
before each punt. In their 14 possessions, they had seven touchdowns, two
field goals, a missed field goal, a fumble, an interception  and the two
punts.
* The 92-yard touchdown on QB Chris Simms' throw to WR B. J. Johnson was the
sixth play of 90 yards or more in UT history. It was the fourth longest pass
play in Longhorn history.
* The Texas offense scored on five consecutive possessions stretching from
the end of the first half (TD, FG) through the entire third quarter (3 TD).
In the second half Texas scored on five of its seven possessions (5 TDs) and
advanced into Houston territory on all seven possessions.

Flowers Has to Give Up Football; McFadden Quits Team

WR Montrell Flowers has had to give up football and backup kicker Matt
McFadden has quit the team.
Head coach Mack Brown said Flowers suffered kidney injuries when he took a
hard hit in the North Carolina game.
He said doctors discovered Flowers only has one kidney and advised him to
give up football.
Brown said he will get a medical scholarship, which won't count against the
85-man limit, and will concentrate on track, where he has two years of
eligiblity left.
"Montrell's injury is really unfortunate," Brown said. "He is a nice kid who
was playing his best football and providing much needed veteran leadership
for us."
Brown also announced that backup kicker Matt McFadden of Coppell has quit the
team to "concentrate on personal matters."
The personal matters are a grand jury indictment against him in Dallas County
on a felony charge of taking and distributing nude photographs of a
17-year-old Coppell girl.
McFadden, a redshirt freshman at Texas, was expected to be the starting place
kicker at Texas this season, but he had a disappointing spring and the
coaches brought in four freshmen walk-on kickers in August.
One of them, Dusty Mangum of  Mesquite, beat him out.

 Horns Land Strong-Armed QB, Swift Athlete as 5th, 6th Commitments

 Texas is up to six commitments already after getting pledges Monday from
 QB
 Billy Don Malone, 6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7, of Paris North Lamar, and RB/Athlete
 Clint Haney, 5-11, 190, 4.27 (that 4.27 was clocked at the A&M Nike camp).

 Both athletes play in Class 4A.
 Malone and Haney both attended the UT mini-camp Sunday, then got offers
 Monday from the Longhorns due to the ridiculous new NCAA rule
 interpretation
 (same old rule, new legal interpretation) that doesn't allow kids to
 commit
 at summer camps. Normally, both would have been offered by coach Mack
 Brown
 at the conclusion of their mini-camp sessions.
 Malone said he chose Texas over Tennessee, Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa State,

 TCU and SMU. He said ISU, TCU and SMU had offered, and North Lamar head
 coach
 Tom Felty said Tennessee, Arkansas and Colorado coaches had told him they
 were preparing to offer his prize pupil.
 Haney said he picked the Longhorns over Texas Tech and Colorado (offers)
 and
 several other schools who  were recruiting him.
 Malone, who has been All-District at quarterback and free safety and in
 basketball as a sophomore and junior, was the district's sophomore of the
 year in both sports.
 "He has a great arm," Felty said, "but what really makes him special is
 the
 way he sees the entire field. He can find his second and third receivers
 and
 he never just locks onto one guy. He's also a very physical player. That's

 what makes him such a fine free safety, and it also helps him at
 quarterback
 because he will hang in there until the last split second to get a
 completion
 even when he knows he's going to get decked."
 There have been some questions about Malone's speed, but Felty said, "We
 play
 in a district with a lot of fast players and I've never seen him caught
 from
 behind. He ran for 405 net yards rushing and four touchdowns, and he had
 more
 than that, but all quarterbacks get sacked and that brought his total
 down.
 He's a threat running or passing."
 His passing is what attracted the Longhorns. Playing for a young 6-4 team,
 he
 completed 106 of 202 passes (52.4%) for 15 touchdowns and had seven
 interceptions.
 Felty said Malone "really loves to play football. He even loves practice.
 Sometimes I have the second-team quarterback working and I see him over
 playing receiver for the scout team. He's ready to practice and ready to
 play
 every day."
 Malone said he is happy to be a Longhorn. "It's a dream come true," he
 said.
 "My coach told me he thought they were going to offer and I was hoping
 they
 would because I really want to play for the Longhorns."
 Asked what he thinks are his strong suits, he said, "I think I have a good

 arm and pretty good speed, but I think mental attitude is really important

 and I play hard and play to win all of the time."
 Haney, who rushed 266 times for 1,665 yards (6.25 yards per carry) and 19
 touchdowns, also was a big threat as a receiver, catching 9 passes for 205

 yards and four touchdowns for the 11-2 Ramgers. He said when he committed,

 "Coach Brown said they were recruiting me as a football player. He told me

 they want fast, athletic kids and they would find a spot for me after I
 get
 there."
 That spot could be running back, but it probably will be wide receiver or
 defensive back.
 Smithson Valley defeated San Marcos in the Class 4A playoffs last year,
 and
 Haney said San Marcos' defensive tackle Earl Anderson, another UT pledge,
 "is
 really fast to be so big. I broke about a 40-yard touchdown run in that
 game
 and he was right behind me most of the way. I'm glad we're going to be on
 the
 same side at Texas."
 Asked why he picked the Longhorns, he said, "Texas has great facilities
 and
 great coaches and it's a first-class academic institution." With a 93.4
 grade
 average and a qualifying test score already, he said the way the Longhorn
 coaches stressed academics along with athletics was a big factor in his
 decision."
 The Longhorns' other commitments are from OL Brett Valdez of Brownwood, DT

 Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale, Arizona, and DT Sonny Davis, who signed with
 Texas last year, but is having to go to a junior college in Mississippi
 because he failed to qualify academically. Davis said he did so well in
 his
 first year in the JC that he has a chance to graduate in time to enroll at

 Texas next January and go through spring practice.

Beltran Qualifies, but Sonny Davis Headed to Junior College

RB Sneezy Beltran of Abilene told me today (Monday) he made a qualifying
score of 18 on the ACT, but the mother of DT Sonny Davis of Austin Lanier
told me her son did not qualify and is heading to Gulf Coast JC in
Mississippi to play football for the next two years.
Beltran is a good student who almost qualified on his first try at the ACT,
but he said he operates best under pressure and he proved it by waiting
until
the last possible date to take it again. He is a full qualifier now and
gives
the Longhorns 19 incoming scholarship recruits.
Texas actually has 22 freshmen who have never redshirted on scholarship,
but
three of them (DT Stevie Lee and S Phillip Geiggar, both of Shreveport
Evangel, and FB Tyrone Richardson of Clarksville) enrolled last January, so
only 19 scholarship freshmen will be reporting next month for the first
time.
In addition to Davis, the Longhorns lost DT Marcel Moses of Texas City to
Kilgore JC. Both Davis and Moses say they plan to come back to UT in two
years after they graduate from junior college.
Lee looked like a future star in spring training, but Texas really needs to
sign some more defensive tackles because All-American Casey Hampton and
All-Big 12 Shaun Rogers are both heading into their senior seasons. The
defensive tackle position in the Texas high school ranks is a true good
news,
bad news story this year. The good news is that Tommie Harris of Killeen
Ellison is as good a DT prospect as there is in the country and he is a
strong Texas lean. The bad news is that there is no one else even close to
him in the entire state. So, if the Horns get Harris, they will have snared
a
great DT, but, if they don't, they sure will need to get one who can play
as
a true freshman the following year.
RB Cedric Benson  of Midland Lee, who ran for a Class 5A record 3,526 yards
and another record 51 touchdowns last season in leading the Rebels to their
second straight State Championship, had to cancel his unofficial visit to
Texas last weekend. He and his mother had planned to fly to Austin
Saturday,
but they were flying standby and got bumped by the holiday traffic. He said
he will come to Austin later this month or in early Augusut to meet with
the
Texas coaches.
He is a long-time UT fan who says he wants to commit to a college this
summer
so he can concentrate on his upcoming senior season. He told me might
commit
to the Longhorns when he takes his unofficial visit.
* * * *
The Longhorns' chances at getting C Greg Barnum of Killeen Ellison are not
as
bright as they were earlier. He likes Texas, but don't believe those
internet
rumors that he has been accepted by the UT admissions office. Barnum was
supposed to be the anchor of Tennessee's offensive line this season, but he
quit the team several weeks ago.
Vol  coach Phil Fulmer has refused to release him. Under Fulmer, the Vols
have one of the worst graduation rates in the college ranks. Barnum was a
good high school student, but few Vol players could meet the academic
requirements to transfer to Texas, and that might be a stumbling block for
Barnum. (If I read this on the internet, I can't be as frank on academic
matters in future e-mails!!!)
* * * *
Texas has 10 early commitments, including QB/DB Kendal Briles of Frenship,
MLB Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison, OLs Mike Garcia of Galena Park (who
switched from A&M to Texas), Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter, Abe Robinson
of
Houston Jersey Village, Roman Reeves of Livingston, Will Allen of Houston
Cypress Falls and Alfio Randall of Blinn JC and DBs Braden Johnson of
Euless
Trinity and Brian Carter of The Woodlands.
* * * *
The UT n baseball coaches have signed left-handed pitcher Brantley Jordan,
6-0, 190, of Texarkana JC and formerly of Round Rock McNeil. Jordan was
11-0
last season with a 1.1 ERA in conference play and a 2-4 ERA overall. He has
a
90 mph fast ball and a very good curve ball to go along with excellent
control.
* * * *
Long-time UT tennis coach Dave Snyder has retired. Let's hope the UT brass
will hire his former top assistant, Dwayne Hultquist, to succeed him.
Hultquist, currently the head tennis coach at Florida State, is a great
recruiter who can do great things at Texas if he gets the chance.

Mitchell, Simms-to-Williams Combination
Way Too Much For Jayhawks; Aggies Next

Kansas came out smoking in damp, freezing Lawrence Saturday, taking a 14-0
lead over Texas before the sparse crowd had time to  settle down, but the
Longhorns came storming back for an easy 51-16  victory.
Senior TB Hodges Mitchell broke the UT and Big 12 records for all-purpose
yardage in a single game. He had 264 yards rushing, 23 yards in receptions
and 88 yards in punt returns for 375 total yards. He also scored two
touchdowns.
But sophomore QB Chris Simms, subbing for the injured Major Applewhite, and
sensational freshman WR Roy Williams also were huge offensive guns for the
Longhorns.
Simms passed for 240 yards and two touchdowns and Williams caught four of h=
is
passes for 180 yards and both touchdowns =01) all in the first half. Willia=
ms
also added a 35-yard touchdown on a new play =01) an end around.
Williams, a true freshman, already held the season record in reception
yardage and in touchdowns for freshmen.
Kansas coach Terry Allen said his defense was able to hold Mitchell's
production down early, "but then we had to double-cover Williams and that
opened some running lanes."
When this UT offense is clicking, it's hard for a defense to stop because
Mitchell just needs a little crease to be productive and he gets those
creases regularly when Williams draws double coverage.
It takes a brave =01) or foolhardy =01) coach to consistently single cover
Williams, a 6-3, 210-pounder with awesome speed and leaping ability.
The victory gave Texas an-2 season record and 6-1 Big 12 mark, heading into
an open week and then the big regular season finale the day after
Thanksgiving against Texas A&M.
The Longhorns have won five games in a row after a 3-2 start.
Here, briefly, is how the game went:
FIRST QUARTER
The Longhorns started fearfully slow offensively and defensively. Texas got
the ball first, couldn't make a first down and punted quickly. Kansas score=
d
in three plays, with WR Derick Mills going the final 29 yards on a reverse =
to
give the Jayhawks a 7-0 lead with 12:45 left. On the fourth play after the
kickoff, Simms' pass in the left flat was picked off and returned 43 yards
for a touchdown by KU CB Andrew Davison. That put the Jayhawks on top, 14-0=
,
with 10:11 left. The Longhorns finally got something going on their third
possession, driving from their own 32 to a first down at the Kansas 4, but
they stalled and Kris Stockton kicked a 19-yard field goal to cut the defic=
it
to 14-3 with 4:50 left. Longhorn LB De'Andre Lewis pounced on a Kansas fumb=
le
four plays later to set the Longhorn s up at the Jayhawk 38. Simms hit
Williams behind Davison for a touchdown on the first play to cut the Kansas=
'
lead to 14-9 with 3:06 left. The Longhorns decided to go for a 2-point
conversion, but it backfired when Simms, under pressure, threw into the end
zone and Kansas safety Carl Nesmith picked it off and returned it 100-plus
yards for two point for the Jayhawks and a 16-9 lead. Huge Longhorn OT
Leonard Davis showed a lot of heart on that play, chasing Nesmith all the w=
ay
down the sideline. But that was the last highlight for the Jayhawks. They h=
ad
to punt from their own 10 and the punter shanked it to the KU 35. With the
Jayhawks now aware of Williams and his long-distance threat, Mitchell ran f=
or
5, then 21 more and then 14 for the TD. Stockton's kick tied it at 16-16 wi=
th
55 seconds left.
SECOND QUARTER
The Texas defense forced the Jayhawks to punt quickly and Williams got behi=
nd
Davison again on the first play and Simms hit him for a 65-yard touchdown
play. Stockton's kick put UT on top for the first time, 23-16, only 28
seconds deep in the quarter. Mitchell set up the Horns' next touchdown with=
 a
25-yard punt return to the Kansas 40. Simms scrambled for four yards, then
hit Williams again to the Jayhawk 2. Mitchell scored on the next play for a
30-16 left with 11 second left in the half. Texas had a 381-131 edge in
yardage and a 15-4 advantage in first downs.
THIRD QUARTER
Kansas had a good drive to open the second half, but redshirt freshman safe=
ty
Dakarai Pearson stopped it with an interception at the UT 47. Later in the
period, Williams scored on a 35-yard end around to give Texas a 37-16 lead
with 4:22 left. Mitchell's 27-yard punt return to the Texas 44 got the
Longhorns started on their next drive. Simms picked up nine yards on a
scramble, then Mitchell ran for 14, 14 more than then 19 for another TD to
run the score to 44-16 with 2:08 left.
FOURTH QUARTER
Backup TB Victor Ike scored the final touchdown on a 2-yard run with 9:54
left. Backup QB Beau Trahan, one of the team's top special teams players,
relieved Simms and played most of the quarter.

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday the Longhorns are a much better football team
than they were early this season.
He said the team's five-game winning streak is something they worked very
hard to achieve.
"I am very proud of our team over the past five weeks," he said. "To win
three conference games on the road, including back-to-back away contests,
against teams that all had something to prove, shows me that our team is no=
t
only tough, but is gaining more confidence.
"As a result, they are also earning back some of their national respect," h=
e
said.
Brown said playing 10 straight weeks worked a real hardship on the team, an=
d
he said the open date this week is very welcome.
He said the regular season finale against Texas A&M on Nov. 24, the Friday
after Thanksgiving, will be a tough one.
"We will use this week to prepare for Texas A&M, which I think has been
underrated all year," he said. "Ja'Mar Toombs is one of the best tailbacks =
in
the country and Robert Ferguson is one of the top receivers."
"It also looks to me as if they have improved their offense with quarterbac=
k
Mark Farris taking the helm, and defensively they are the same great team
that they have always been. We will have our hands full in two weeks."
But he said the Longhorns have improved so much that they have a chance to
close strong if they keep working hard.
He also said sophomore QB Chris Simms, subbing for the injured Major
Applewhite, "gets better every time he gets to play."
"I was pleased with the way he came back after his rough start," Brown said=
.
"He showed the ability to scramble and make plays."
"He also displayed good leadership in the huddle, Brown said. "We should ha=
ve
thrown the ball more in the second half, but we still wanted to  be physica=
l
and use the running game as much as possible."
Brown said the victory at Kansas was a big one because it was the second
straight tough road trip and the players really kept their focus.
"Overall, we felt that it was a very good win for us. We were able to play
everybody that we took on the trip and came out of the game very well."
"Offensively, we won the field position battle with our kicking game, Roy
Williams played great, and we were obviously pleased to have 61 plays in th=
e
running game produce about 400 yards."
"In fact," he said, "we have felt good about our running game over the last
five weeks as Hodges (Mitchell) has established himself as one of the best
running backs in the country."
"In terms of the quarterback position, we only threw the ball three times i=
n
the second half, but I thought Chris Simms got better as the game went on. =
He
hit big plays in the passing game and kept moving the chains for us."
"Defensively," Brown said, "we didn't let Kansas score again after their
first drive, so we also played very well on that side of the ball."
Brown said he knew the Longhorns had hit the jackpot when they signed WRs
Williams, B. J. Johnson and Sloan Thomas last February, but he said the
freshmen receivers are even better than he thought.
"I have been very impressed with the maturity of Roy , Sloan and B.J.," he
said. "Yesterday was a day that young players could have been flat because =
of
the cold weather and lack of a big crowd. I have been amazed all year with
how these freshmen play as if they are older. The young players have compet=
ed
and showed a lot of maturity, which is hard to do at that age."
Brown said he has been telling the team it needs to keep winning to have a
shot at a good bowl game.
"We try to have a theme each week," he said, "and our theme last week was t=
o
put ourselves in position to go to the best bowl possible."
"Regardless of what bowl it is, we know we do not get to choose," he said. =
"I
went through the bowls available to our team last week, which was the only
time this year that we have mentioned bowls."
"I also showed our players the records of each team in the league, and told
them that it is critical for them to beat Kansas," he said, adding that eac=
h
win improves the bowl picture for the team.

Horns Climb to 14th in AP

Texas is ranked 14th in this week's Associated Press poll.
Five Big 12 teams are in the top 25, headed by top-ranked Oklahoma, the onl=
y
team remaining with a perfect record.
Other Big 12 teams ranked are Kansas State at No. 9, Nebraska at No. 10 and
Texas A&M at No. 21.
One cautionary note should be injected here. There is a very good reason wh=
y
Texas has not finished in the AP's top 10 since 1983.
It is the fact that every time the Longhorns got close to the top 10 or
actually got in the top 10, the unthinkable happened and they lost and went
tumbling down the rankings.
You have to go back no farther than the start of this season. The Horns
opened at No. 7, and in the second week of the season, they ventured out to
Palo Alto and got upset by Stanford. They haven't been close to the top 10
since =01) until now.
If they beat the Aggies and win their bowl game, they will break that 17-ye=
ar
drought, but that's a big "if."

A Clutch Freshman

True freshman WR Roy Williams has been Mr. Clutch for the Longhorns. He is
averaging 47.6 yards per catch on his seven touchdown receptions.
In addition, five of his TD grabs came when the Horns were behind or tied a=
nd
the other two came when UT held either a 3-point or 7-point lead.

Basketball Team Opens

The Longhorn men's basketball team opens its season tonight (Monday) when i=
t
hosts Navy at 7 p.m. in the Erwin Center in the opening round of the
Preseason NIT.
Texas won its two pre-season exhibition games leading up to the start of th=
e
regular season, showing a surprisingly strong inside game without departed
big men Chris Mihm and Gabe Muoneke.
Freshman forward James Thomas was a big factor in both exhibition games. He
had 21 points and nine rebounds in the 84-67 victory over EA Sports
California All-Stars Wednesday after getting 25 points and nine boards in t=
he
92-81 triumph overTeam Ezybonds of Australia last Sunday.
Junior forward Chris Owens had 20 points and seven rebounds against the
California team and 27 points and 14 rebounds against Ezybonds.
Junior swingman Maurice Evans, a transfer from Wichita State, had15 points,
seven rebounds and three blocks against EA Sports, and freshman Brian
Boddicker had 10 points and eight boards in just 19 minutes.
Junior transfer point guard Fredie Williams scored five points, three steal=
s
and nine assists against only three turnovers.

Lee Will Get Medical Redshirt

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday freshman DT Stevie Lee won't play against Texa=
s
A&M because the broken bone in his foot has not allowed him to begin
practicing.
That means Lee will get a medical redshirt and will be a redshirt freshman
next year.
He was injured in the third game and anyone who suffers a season-ending
injury prior to the fourth game is eligible for a medical redshirt year.
INJURY NOTES: Brown said starting QB Major Applewhite is questionable for t=
he
Aggie game. He suffered a knee sprain against Texas Tech and  missed the
Kansas game.
Brown said safety Lee Jackson's leg injury is much better and he probably
will play against A&M.
WR Artie Ellis (shin) and TE Brock Edwards (leg) are both questionable for
the Aggie game.
Edwards' injury left the Horns with converted FB Chad Stevens as the only
healthy scholarship TE at Kansas.
DT Shaun Rogers played without reinjuring his ankle and should be closer to
100% for the Aggie game than he has been since early this season.
OG Antwan Kirk-Hughes has been having problems with a shoulder, and it
bothered him during the Kansas game, but the week off should give him a
chance to be ready for the Aggie game.

Scouting Texas A&M

The Longhorns finally get a week off after playing 10 consecutive games, an=
d
they need to try to get  rested and get some people well for their annual
shoot-out with traditional rival Texas A&M on Nov. 24, the day after
Thanksgiving.
The game has a 2:30 p.m. kickoff and will be televised nationally by ABC.
Texas is ranked No. 14 in the AP poll and A&M is No. 21.
The Longhorns are 8-2 and the Aggies are 7-3 heading into the game, and Tex=
as
is also a game ahead in the race for second place in the Big 12 South, with=
 a
6-1 record to A&M's 5-2.
The Aggies, like the Longhorns, had a slow start this season. They opened
with a 24-10 loss at Notre Dame, before winning three straight, over Wyomin=
g,
51-3, UTEP, 45-17, and Texas Tech, 33-15.
But then they were upset at home by previously winless Colorado, 26-19.
Much like the debacle in Dallas caused Texas to bear down and start playing
better, the loss to Colorado seemed to bring out the best in A&M.
Since that disappointing loss, they have defeated Baylor, 24-0, Iowa State,
30-7, and Northern Division leader Kansas State, 26-10, before losing to
top-ranked Oklahoma Saturday by a razor-thin 35-31 margin.
Mark Farris, a 25-year-old sophomore who gave pro baseball a whirl before
winning the A&M QB job, has put some life into the Aggies' offense.
He is a very cool, and very accurate passer and he has some outstanding
receivers. Huge TB/FB Ja'Mar Toombs also is an effective weapon.
But it is on defense where the Aggies win or lose most games. The Longhorns=
'
outstanding defense actually has better statistics overall, but the Aggies
are No. 6 in the country in scoring defense, giving up an average of only
13.1 points per game.
There are four keys to a UT victory, two on offense, one on defense and one
on special teams.
Offensively, they must be balanced and they can't lose the turnover battle,
and they surely can't stand any touchdowns by the Aggie defense.
Defensively, they have to shut down the Aggie running game and pressure
Farris.
On special teams, the Aggies are good at blocking punts and the Longhorns
have had some blocked. That's a no-no if the Horns want to win this one.
Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):

Big 12 Roundup

Barring some monumental upsets, Oklahoma and Kansas State will meet in Kans=
as
City in early December in the Big 12 Championship Game.
The top-ranked Sooners survived their toughest test of the year by rallying
to beat Texas A&M, 35-31, in College Station.
The Sooners would have to lose their last two games against Texas Tech and
Oklahoma State and Texas would have to beat Texas A&M for OU to miss the
title game.
All K-State has to do is beat 2-7 Missouri Saturday to secure its berth in
Kansas City.

Part 2 - True Orange

Texas Loses to LSU in World Series, Plays FSU Tonight

The Texas baseball made a huge leap from fourth in the Big 12 to no worse
than a tie for seventh in the country and it could be even better than that
by the time you read this newsletter.
The Longhorns won their way into the College Baseball Series in Omaha by
winning a sub-regional, then a super regional in the last two weeks.
No. 2 seed LSU, which won four national titles in the 1990s, burst the No. =
7
seed Longhorns' bubble, at least temporarily, with a 13-5 thumping Saturday
night in the first round of the World Series.
That threw Texas into the loser's bracket and the Horns were to play Florid=
a
State, a 6-4 loser to Southern Cal Saturday, in an elimination game at 6
p.m.
tonight (Monday).
If the Longhorns lose, their season is over. If they win, they will play th=
e
loser of the winner's bracket game between LSU and USC. If they win that
game, then they would have to beat the unbeaten team twice to win their
division and set up a championship game against the winner of the other
four-team bracket.
That is a tall order because it means the Longhorns would have to win win
five straight games to capture their fifth national title.
But, whatever happens tonight or later in the tournament, coach Augie
Garrido
and his Longhorns are back in Omaha for the first time since 1993 and UT
baseball is back on track.
They did it by snapping out of a late-season slump that saw them get shut
out
three times in their last six regular season games, then go 1-2 in the Big
12
Tournament.
Because of their slow finish, they were sent to a tough sub-regional in
Tempe, Arizona, where the host team, powerful Arizona State, was a big
favorite to advance.
The Longhorns opened by beating Creighton, 5-4, but then they fell to ASU,
3-1, to drop into the loser's bracket. It was a waste of an outstanding
pitching performance by Beau Hale, who held the powerful Sun Devils at bay
for most of the day.
The Horns had to come back and play again that same day, May 27, and
freshman
Ray Clark saved the season by pitching a three-hitter in an 11-1 romp past
Miami of Ohio. It was an amazing performance by a true freshman and it also
was a breakout game for the Longhorn hitters, who had snoozed through most
of
May.
That meant Texas had to beat ASU on the Sun Devils' home field twice on May
28 after playing two games on May 27 to advance.
But Clark's complete game gave Texas a chance because it kept the Horns fro=
m
depleting their pitching staff before even getting to the final day.
Phil Seibel, who missed almost the entire season with a sore arm, allowed
just five hits and one earned run in 6 1/3 innings and Ben Emond drove in
two
runs and scored two more to power Texas to a 6-4 win in the first game.
Freshman Ryan Hubele hit a three-run homer and Beau Hale put down a threat
in
the ninth to give the Horns the championship game by a 9-7 score.
Hubele was the tourney MVP after hitting .529 and batting in six runs.
Second
baseman Tommy Nicholson, shortstop Todd West, outfielder Matt Rosenberg and
pitchers Hale and Seibel made the All-Tournament team.
The championship in Tempe earned the Horns a host spot in a super regional
against Penn State.  Texas won the opener, 7-3, behind the pitching of D. J=
.
Jones, then mauled the Lions, 10-0, behind Hale's three-hit, 12-strikeout
performance.
By the time most of you read this, the Longhorns' season might be over, so
let's look to the future.
Most of the key pitchers on this team will be gone next year, but a few of
them will return, and Garrido and his staff have signed some great arms to
replace the guys who are leaving.
They also have signed some big sticks that should enable the Horns to start
winning a few slugfests.
They have rounded up an outstanding 26-man recruiting class that gives them
an excellent chance of being able to reload instead of undertaking a
complete
rebuilding job next baseball season.
They had a 25-man class that was really good, but they added No. 26 last
weekend and that really was the frosting on the cake because he is Ben King=
,
a slugging, hard-throwing lefthander from Grapevine who is leaving Alabama
and coming to Texas after an outstanding freshman season.
After getting the Longhorns into the College Baseball World Series this
year,
nothing would be sweeter than doing it again next year, and this group of
recruits just might help them accomplish that feat.
Of the 26 recruits, only two great prospects seem likely to sign. They are
catcher Scott Heard of Rancho Bernardo High School in suburban San Diego an=
d
first baseman Jason Stokes of Coppell.
Heard, 6-2, 190, hit .303 last season with 10 homers, but he is more famous
for his defensive prowess. The pro scouts think he is the best overall
catching prospect in several years, and that prompted the Texas Rangers to
draft him in the first round.
Stokes, 6-5, 235, is an incredible power hitter who batted .567 and blasted
25 home runs last season and was chosen by the Florida Marlins with the
first
pick in the draft's second round.
Both are expected to receive offers that will be very difficult to pass up.
Both families say negotiations with their pro teams are in the early stages=
.
They also say, contrary to published reports, that no firm offers have been
made.
Let's take a quick look at the other 24 UT recruits. Most of them signed in
the early period, but this is an up-to-date look at how they performed in
the
just-completed baseball season.

Late Transfer Bonus Baby (1)
Ben King, 6-1, 195, will be eligible next season as a sophomore because you
don't have to sit out a year in baseball when you transfer. He was one of
the
state's top recruits last year and picked Alabama over Texas. He was an
honorable mention freshman All-America at Alabama after hitting 13 home run=
s
and batting .294 as a designated hitter. But King was a dominating pitcher
in
high school and he wants to pitch, too. He only pitched  four innings at
Alabama, and that, in a nutshell, is why he will be a Longhorn next season.
As a lefty with good control and a 91-mile-an-hour fastball, he'll get to
pitch more than that at Texas in 2001. The Horns can use that powerful bat,
too. With the low scholarship limits in baseball (11.7 total, chopped into
various sizes), pitcher-hitter combos give double value.

Pitchers (10)
Albert Montes, 6-2, 205, is a righthanded pitcher from El Paso who was the
ace of the National JC World Series champs from Grayson JC in Denison. He
went 11-3 and Grayson coach Tim Tadlock said, "Albert Montes should have
been
the MVP of the national tournament. He won the opening game for us, then
came
back to win two other games. He has a fastball in the 90s to go along with =
a
good curve, but the thing that makes him so good is that he changes his arm
angles a lot and gives the batters a lot of different looks. He's a real
bulldog on the mound." Montes pitched the championship game on two days'
rest
and gave up three hits and one run while striking out 13. He was the
national
tourney's Most Valuable Pitcher in 1999 and 2000 and won the title game bot=
h
times.
Justin Simmons, 6-3, 200, is a lefty with great control who led Duncanville
to the Class 5A State Tournament for the third straight year. He had a
losing
outing against The Woodlands in the state semifinals, but wound up 12-3 for
the year. In 94 innings, he gave up 75 hits, walked 19 and struck out 126.
He
has three pitches he can throw for strikes on a consistent basis =01) a
changeup, a curve and a moving 85-mph fastball. In addition to being the
dominant pitcher in the Dallas area, he also was one of the leading hitters
with a .479 average and eight home runs. He plays first base when he isn't
on
the mound.
Tim McGough, 5-11, 170, is a righthander from Fort Worth Nolan who went 7-0
last season with a 0.48 ERA. He pitched a 7-0 shutout against Houston St.
Pius in the State TAPPS semi-finals and struck out 78 batters in 40 innings=
,
while walking only eight batters. He has been clocked as high as 94 mph, an=
d
consistently throws in the 90-92 range, and he also has an outstanding curv=
e
ball. He also averaged 14 points a game as the shooting guard on the Nolan
basketball team.
Bankston McMath, 5-11, 165, is from Corsicana and he played the last two
years at Navarro JC. He is a righthander who was the team's closer last
season. He notched 10 saves and averaged two strikeouts per inning. He has =
a
consistent 93 mph fast ball, and has been clocked as high as 96. He also
played shortstop for Navarro and batted .300 with five home runs.
Chris Neuman, 6-2, 190, is a lefthanded pitcher-slugger who could be the
comeback kid of the year. As a junior, he had a live fastball in the low
90s,
struck out 91 in 42 innings and had an 0.83 ERA. But he hurt his shoulder
late in the season and had arthroscopic surgery. He did not pitch his senio=
r
year, but hit .485 with six home runs. His father, Harvey, told me the
doctors think his shoulder is fine now and he should be able to resume
pitching at Texas with no ill effects from the surgery. If he does recover
completely, a lefthander with good control and a live 90-mph fastball is a
thing of beauty when he plays for you and a terror to behold when he plays
for the other team.
Gerrit Simpson, 6-3, 195, is a righthanded pitcher-first baseman from
Claremore, Okla., who played the last two years at Connors JC in Oklahoma.
He
was 8-2 as a pitcher last season who averaged more than 1 1/2 strikeouts pe=
r
inning and allowed only two walks per game. His fast ball is consistent
around 90 and has been clocked as high as 93. He also has a good curve ball=
.
He hit .400, too.
Derek Denman, 6-3, 225, is a righthander from Euless Trinity who was the
closer on Grayson's JC title team. He had eight saves. In addition to a liv=
e
fastball that ranges from 88 to 91 miles per hour, he also has a very good
curve and an improving slider to go along with excellent control.
Derrick Grigsby, 6-0, 195, is a righthander who led Marshall deep into the
Class 5A state playoffs. He went 11-1 with a 1.5 ERA and pitched a 2-0
shutout against the eventual state finalist team from The Woodlands in the
state playoffs, but the Mavericks lost the other two games in the series.
"Yeah, they beat us twice by one run," Grigsby told me. "That really hurt."
His fast ball has been clocked as high as 93 miles per hour and he is
consistently in the 89-90 mph range.
Eugene Espineli, 6-4, 170, is a lefthander who went 10-2 with a 1.90 ERA fo=
r
Katy Taylor. He struck out 110 and walked only 22 in 75 innings. His best
pitches are a changeup and a fastball in the mid 80s.
John Zamora, 6-3, 205, is a native of Campbell, Cal., who played the last
two
seasons at Cabrillo JC in California. He is a righthander who has a good
slide and a fastball in the low 90s. Despite playing with a fractured thumb
on his throwing hand last season, he still posted a 6-4 record with a 2.5
ERA. He was drafted after his freshman year in JC, but was not drafted this
year. He signed with Texas last month, turning down offers from LSU, USC an=
d
others.

Catchers (1)
Ben Anderson, 5-9, 180, is from Temalpais High School in Mill Valley, Cal.
He
hit .550 with 4 homers last season and has fine defensive skills.

Infielders (6)
Tim Moss, 5-11, 170, is a three-sport star who played second base and
shortstop at Lancaster. He hit .450 as a junior, but began working as a
switch hitter this season and hit .390 with five home runs. He was such an
outstanding point guard that he also received some basketball scholarship
offers and he ran a 10.6 100 meters for the track team. He has been clocked
at 6.4 in the 60.
Chase Lambin, 6-2, 185, is from Houston Cypress Falls and he played third
base the last two years for the two-time national JC champion Grayson team.
He batted .370 and blasted 11 homers last season.
Wayne Stone, 6-1, 185, is a second and third baseman from Riverside JC in
California. He originally is from Rialto JC. He hit .395 with four home run=
s
last season.
Omar Quintanilla, 5-9, 175, is a power-hitting shortston-second baseman fro=
m
el Paso Socorro. He hit .548 and belted 14 home runs as a senior.
Cooper Vittitow, 6-0, 180, played at Lubbock Monterey and has been playing
second and third base at Hill JC in Hillsboro for the last two years. He hi=
t
.345 with six home runs last season.
Kasey Baker, 5-9, 170, played second and third base for Houston Langham
Creek
and batted .295 with six home runs last season. He has tremendous defensive
skills.
Outfielders (6)
Vincent Sinisi, 6-1, 190, led The Woodlands to the Class 5A State
Championship game. He pitched the 11-1 semifinal victory over Duncanville,
running his record to 9-2 this season, but he is first and foremost a
hitter.
Despite a nagging sprained ankle that had his batting average lagging below
.300 early in the season, he went on a hitting tear in the late season and
playoffs and raised the average to .400 while hitting 10 home runs.
Gerald Napoleon, 5-9, 175, is from Aurora, Colo, and he played at New Mexic=
o
JC in Hobbs for the last two seasons. He hit .477 and blasted nine home
runs,
and he also is an oustanding defensive centerfielder who has excellent
speed.
He signed last month.
Jake Duncan, 6-0, 180, batted .461 and hit 11 homers for Marshall's powerfu=
l
team and was named co-MVP in the district. His father, Doug, an Marshall
physician, was the catcher on UT's 1975 National Championship team. Jake's
younger brother, Zach, a pitcher-outfielder, was the district's Sophomore o=
f
the Year.
Eric Sultemeier, 6-2, 180, is a fleet outfielder from New Braunfels. He hit
.417 with nine homers last season. He was the MVP in his district in
baseball
the last two years and was the Co-MVP in football last season after making
second-team All-State as a wide receiver. He was drafted by Cincinnati in
the
14th round.
Stephen Ripper, 6-5, 210, was on the outfielders on the Houston Bellaire
team
that went 66-4 during the last two seasons, winning state in 1999 with one
of
the best hitting teams I ever saw. He hit .413 with six home runs last
season.
Cody Roy Andre', 6-1, 195, is a native of Greely, Colo., who played the las=
t
two seasons at Seward County JC in Liberal, Kan. He hit .401 with 15 homers
as a freshman, and batted .313 with six home runs as a sophomore.

Carlisle Honored

Duke Carlisle, who led the Longhorns to their first National Championship i=
n
1963 and followed it up by throwing  two long touchdown passes in a 28-6
victory over No. 2 Navy in the 1964 Cotton Bowl, has been selected to the
Southwestern Bell Cotton Bowl Hall of Fame.
Ironically, Roger Staubach, who won the 1963 Heisman Trophy and was the Nav=
y
quarterback, also was inducted into the Cotton Bowl Hall of Fame with
Carlisle.
The Longhorns took the No. 1 ranking in 1963 when they trounced top-ranked
Oklahoma, 28-7, and they held the top spot for the remainder of the season.
Carlisle played when freshmen were ineligible, but he still played in the
Cotton Bowl eight times =01) three times against powerful Oklahoma teams, t=
wice
against SMU and three times as the SWC champ. He had a 7-1 record, with the
only loss being to LSU in the 1963 Cotton Bowl Classic.
Carlisle was recruited out of Athens. He now lives in McComb, Miss.
He is the fourth Longhorn legend chosen for the Hall of Fame, joining his
coach, Darrell Royal, and two other Texas quarterbacks =01) Bobby Layne and
James Street.

Longhorns Facing Last Breather Before Tough Stretch Run

The Longhorns need to use Saturday's game with Baylor to jump start their
offense because the Bears might be the worst team in the Big 12, but the
Horns finish the regular season with risky road trips to Texas Tech and
Kansas and then a home game with Texas A&M.
A slow start offensively in any of those last three game could be fatal,
just
like it was against Stanford and Oklahoma. The offense finally scored an
offensive touchdown in the first quarter Saturday, and it was their first
in
the first quarter since the Texas Tech game last year.
Let's hope they get out to a fast start Saturday and it carries over into
the
last three games.
* * * *
Freshman TE Brock Edwards is a talented young man who should be able to
step
up and do the job now that the team's top two tight ends (Bo Scaife and
Mike
Jones) are injured, UT tight end coach Tim Brewster said Tuesday.
"We're going to expect him to step up and play well," Brewster said. "We're
not going to put any limitations on him because he's a freshman. We've told
all the freshmen who have been playing that they aren't freshmen anymore.
We'll try to do everything we would normally do with the tight end."
Coach Mack Brown said Edwards, who was a tailback his senior year in high
school, has worked hard to improve his blocking. "He's doing much better
with
hjis blocking" Brown said. "That was his problem early, because he hadn't
done it before, but he's picking it up pretty good."
Brown said Jones is out this week and for the forseeable future. He said FB
Chad Stevens worked at TE Tuesday and will continue to practice at both
positions.
With Edwards starting at TE, the Longhorns will have true freshmen starting
at their three primary pass-catching positions because Roy Williams and B.
J.
Johnson are the starting WRs. Another true freshman WR, Sloan Thomas,
caught
two touchdown passes against Missouri.
DT Marcus Tubbs appeared to be recovered from his sore shoulder, and
starting
DT Shaun Rogers said his sprained ankle is feeling much better. He was
moving
better than he has since he injured it four weeks ago.
OG Antwan Kirk-Hughes probably will start Saturday and play until and
unless
his shoulder injury flares up again, offensive coordinator Greg Davis said.
Brown also said WR Artie Ellis is questionable for the Baylor game with a
sore shin.
* * * *
Former Auburn Heisman Trophy winner and former pro star Bo Jackson talked
to
the team after practice Tuesday. Brown said Jackson told the players to
make
the most of their days playing for the Longhorns because they will always
be
known as Texas Longhorns. He said Jackson still identifies with Auburn more
than the NFL.
* * * *
FOOTBALL RECRUITING  NOTES: Fullback James Buchanon of Sarasota, Fla.,
picked
Florida State over Texas and Boston College Tuesday. The decision was
expected. . . Folks, in talking to the top recruits who are still out
there,
I think DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia HS in Placentia, Cal., is the only
out-of-state prospect left who  is a strong Longhorn lean. I also think
there
is a good chance Jakes, Galena Park North Shore's dynamic duo of TE James
Moses and DE Jonathan Jackson and Waco's super linebacker Derrick Johnson
are
all future Longhorns. I hope Tommie Harris is, too, but that one is still
up
in the air.
* * * *
FOOTBALL NOTES: Some of the freshmen who are being redshirted are
impressing
the first-team guys with their work on the  scout team. Six who draw
consistent praise from the starters are LB Austin Sendlein, QB Chance Mock,
TB Sneezy Beltran, FB Will Matthews, WR Tony Jeffery and OT Lionel Garr.
* * * *
My next fax will be whenever events warrant. Please note that is Fax No.
101.
I don't start a new series until Dec. 1, so it looks like I will be doing
about 110 to 120 during this 12-month series. I promise at least 99 and I
have never done less than 104. I do them when I think they are needed and a
lot have been needed this year.
* * * *
The True Orange Fax Service includes  at  least  99 faxes  a year and costs
$99 ($79 by E-Mail). The True Orange Newsletter includes  26 newsletters

Applewhite Works Out, But Brown Says  Simms Will Start

QB Major Applewhite worked out Tuesday without any obvious problems with
his
sprained knee, but coach Mack Brown said backup QB Chris Simms will start
Friday against Texas A&M.
"If it (the knee) doesn't swell, he has a chance to be available to play if

we need him to win," Brown said, adding that the trainers will check
Applewhite's knee after each practice to see if there is any swelling.
"Major did everything today," he said. "He dropped back, he sprinted out,
and
I was surprised at how well he was moving."
But Brown said Simms will start and Applewhite will be held in reserve in
case he is needed.
"The doctors said Major is between questionable and probable," Brown said.
He
said he isn't sure what that means, but it probably means he can play in a
pinch ? and that means if the coaches feel Simms isn't getting the job done

and the team is in danger of losing the game.
"Chris will start the game for us," Brown said, "and if Major is healthy
enough to go, we will use him to win the ball game if necessary."
Brown said  safety Lee Jackson and TE Brock Edwards, both battling leg
injuries, won't be able to play against A&M.
Brown also encouraged all fans to meet the team two hours before the game
Friday. The team will arrive at the south end of Royal Memorial Stadium at
12:30 p.m. Brown said the team will need a lot of fan support to wind
Friday
and remain unbeaten this year at home.
Defensive coordinator  Carl Reese said he will use a lot of defensive
formations against A&M, but he said the traditional 4-3 probably will be
used
most of the time because of the Aggies' strong running game.
"They really like to use their power running game," he said, "and that's
something we have to stop. They can throw the ball much better than in the
past, but we need to make them one-dimensional."
* * * *
THE WEATHER: The weather forecast for Friday afternoon calls for
temperatures
in the high 50s, some thunderstorms and possibly some gusting winds.
* * * *
Senior OT Leonard Davis was the only Longhorn chosen for the Football
Writers
Association of America's All-America team. WR Roy Williams and DE Kalen T
hornton were chosen to the Rivals.com True Freshman All-America team and
WR B. J. Johnson made honorable mention. Williams was chosen as the
offensive
player of the year.
* * * *
FOOTBALL RECRUITING NOTES: I missed a Longhorn who committed to A&M in my
fax/e-mail last night. CB Roderick Babers said he committed to A&M "for
about
two hours, and then Mack Brown talked me out of it."  The others who
committed to A&M before switching to Texas are QB Major Applewhite, OT
Leonard Davis and backup TB Victor Ike. Another Longhorn who came close to
being an Aggie is redshirt freshman QB Chance Mock, who was all set to
commit
to A&M last year before taking a trip to Texas "just to be sure." He said
Texas would have "to blow me away" to keep him from committing to A&M. When

he got back home and committed to Texas, he had a simple explanation. "They

blew me away," he said. . . DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison and S
Dewayne
Brandon of Temple, two of the state's top players, both plan to come to the

game Friday. Many other top players would have attended, but they are on
playoff teams and have games to play Friday or Saturday. . . Here's my very

early top dozen Texas' recruits for next year: QB Reggie McNeal, 6-3, 180,
4.5, Lufkin; WR J. T. Perry, 6-1, 180, 4.4, Allen; DTs Rodrique Wright,
6-5,
300, 5.0, Alief Hastings; Earl Anderson,  6-4, 270, 4.9, San Marcos, and
Marco Martin, 6-4, 290, 4.7, Mesquite; DE Travis Leitko, 6-5, 255, 4.7, The

Woodlands; LBs Marvin Byrdsong, 6-3, 240, 4.5, Longview; Andy Matakis, 6-3,

220, 4.55, Corpus Christi Flower Bluff, and Archie McDaniel, 6-3, 225, 4.7,

Bay City; S Michael Cuba, 6-3, 190, Taylor, and Athletes Vincent Young,
6-5,
200, 4.5, Houston Madison, and Broderick Thomas, 6-0, 190, 4.5, Longview.

Applewhite Has Knee Sprain, Won't Play at Kansas & He's Iffy for Aggies

Coach Mack Brown said Monday the MRI on QB Major Applewhite's knee showed a
strained PCL (posterior cruciate ligament) in his right knee that will
sideline him for the Kansas game and possibly for the Texas A&M game, too.
"It's a sprained ligament," Brown said. "It won't require surgery, but he
is
out for this week and he's questionable for A&M."
Brown said he is slightly optimistic because "I've had five kinee
operations
and I never was moving around  as good as Major was Saturday night after
the
game."
But he said sophomore Chris Simms is the starting QB and will be backed up
by
Beau Trahan, with WR Courtnee Garcia, a former high school QB, also getting
some snaps at QB just in case any additional injuries occur at the
position.
Brown said he has no plans to play freshman Chance Mock, who is
redshirting,
because he said Mock runs the opposing teams' offenses for the scout team
against the Longhorn defense and hasn't worked with the first or second
team
offenses all year.
"We think he is going to be a very good player, but we still plan to
redshirt
him this year," Brown said.
I talked to a couple of friends who are outstanding knee surgeons and both
said Applewhite will have a hard time returning in time for the A&M game.
They said he would have a very difficult time backing up with a sprained
PCL.
Brown said it will be important for the offense to be two-dimensional
against
Kansas  so all the pressure for moving the offense does not fall on Simms.
Freshman DT Stevie Lee (broken bone in foot) won't be able to play Saturday
at Kansas, Brown said, adding that it looks like Lee, who was injured in
the
third game, will not be able to play again this year and will be eligible
for
a medical redshirt that will give him four more years of eligibility. If a
player is injured prior to the fourth game, he is eligible for a medical
redshirt if he is unable to return later in the season.
Brown said backup CB Ervis Hill has a separated shoulder and is out for the
rest of the season. He also said backup WR Artie Ellis is still having
problems with a sore shin and won't play Saturday.
Redshirt freshman DT Ryan Haywood underwent shoulder surgery last week and
Brown said the doctors said it went well.
* * * *
The Longhorns are starting true freshmen at their three primary recever
positions, and Brown said all three of them are playing well. WRs Roy
Williams and B. J. Johnson have been starting for several weeks and they
already rank first (Williams) and second (Johnson) on the list of Longhorn
freshmen receivers in yardage for a season. TE Brock Edwards moved up when
Mike Jones hurt his knee, and Brown said Edwards, who got his second start
Saturday at Texas Tech, "played really, really well. His blocking is much
better and he made two outstanding catches." Williams has 544 yards in
receptions this season and Johnson has 496. The previous freshman high was
set by Lovell Pinkney, who had 458 receiving yards as a freshman in 1992.
* * * *
Brown said the Longhorns have been playing much better during their
four-game
winning streak, and he cited three primary reasons. "The Oklahoma game got
our attention, we simplified our offense and Major got well," he said. He
said Applewhite had started looking like his old self in recent weeks.
"Seven
months out of a knee operation is not a long time," he said, citing the
time
between the surgery on Applewhite's left knee and the start of two-a-days.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: Super DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison plans to come
to
the A&M game the day after Thanksgiving. . . I'm not sure how soon it will
happen, but I will be very surprised if super LB Derrick Johnson of Waco or
super safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple wind up anywhere else but in Austin.

 Round Rock Westwood Wide Receiver Becomes 7th Commitment

 Wide receiver Dustin Miksch, 6-0, 165, 4.4, of Round Rock Westwood said
 Thursday he called UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis and committed to
 the
 Longhorns. He is Texas' seventh early committment.
 Miksch ran a 4.35 40 at the Texas A&M Nike camp and followed that with a
 4.4
 at the Texas camp that ended Wednesday. "I won the fastest man contest at
 both camps," he said. He also ran a 10.53 100 meters last track season.
 Miksch, the son of former Longhorn WR Donnie Miksch, a 1977-78 letterman
 from
 Needville, said Purdue, Nebraska, A&M, Notre Dame and Oklahoma were all
 recruiting him. He said Purdue and Nebraska coaches had invited him to
 their
 summer camps. "I'll have to call both of them and tell them I won't be
 coming
 to their camps," he said.
 He caught 46 passes for 676 yards and five touchdowns for the 4-6 Warriors

 last season.
 Houston Madison's Donald Burgs, one of the state's top cornerback
 recruits,
 also attended the UT camp that ended Wednesday. He had  been a strong
 Texas
 lean earlier, but he know says he is wide open and probably won't commit
 to
 anyone this summer.
 Burgs praised Miksch when I talked to him Wednesday night. When I asked
 him
 if anyone at the camp really impressed him, he said, "There was a wide
 receiver from Round Rock named Dustin something who was really good. He
 was
 hard to cover and he has really good speed. He has good hands, too."
 The Longhorn coaches can't comment on recruits, but Burgs wasn't the only
 one
 Miksch impressed because the Texas coaches usually try to sign larger wide

 receivers.
 "I've been a Longhorn fan all my life," Miksch said. "I've always gone to
 the
 games and it gives me the chills when the players run through that smoke
 before the game. This was an easy choice for me when Texas offered a
 scholarship. This is where I've always wanted to play."
 Texas  got commitments Monday from QB Billy Don Malone, 6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7,
 of
 Paris North Lamar, and RB/Athlete Clint Haney, 5-11, 190, 4.27 of Smithson

 Valley.
 Malone and Haney both attended the UT mini-camp Sunday, then got offers
 Monday from the Longhorns due to the new NCAA rule interpretation that
 doesn't allow kids to commit at summer camps. Normally, both would have
 been
 offered by coach Mack Brown at the conclusion of their mini-camp sessions.
 The Longhorns' other commitments are from DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos,
 OL
 Brett Valdez of Brownwood, DT Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale, Arizona, and DT

 Sonny Davis, who signed with Texas last year, but is having to go to a
 junior
 college in Mississippi because he failed to qualify academically.
 Speaking of academically qualifying, only two of the Longhorns' February
 signees are still in limbo after CB Aaron Ross of Tyler qualified earlier
 this week. The two who are still trying to make it academically are RB
 Anthony Johnson of Jefferson and LB Yamil LeBron of Killeen Ellison.
 (Editor's Note: I don't put out as much  academic information as I did in
 earlier years because (a) it is not a good subject for internet bulletin
 boards, and (b) it tends to irritate the high school coaches. So, please
 use
 this information judiciously.)
 Super RB Cedric Benson says the only way he will sign a pro baseball
 contract
 is if he gets an offer that lets him play college football, like Ricky
 Williams did when he was at Texas. The Midland Lee star has a chance to
 solve the Longhorns' problems at running back, and he says he is raring to

 get that chance.
 * * * *
 BASKETBALL NOTES: Ed Kohtala, who has been an assistant to UT head
 baskeball
 coach Rick Barnes since he arrived at Texas three seasons ago, has been
 named
 head coach at Alma College in Alma, Michigan. Barnes is expected to name a

 replacement in the next couple of weeks.
 *  * * *
 CATCH 22: A guy who made an internet post some time back accusing me by
 name
 of trying to kill Texas' football recruiting, put a post on an internet
 bul
 letin board yesterday saying Texas needs to recruit a quarterback this
 time around because the Horns didn't get one last year. That's his
 sarcastic
 way of ridiculing Matt Nordgren, UT's QB signee last February. Classy
 posts
 like that are sure to help Texas recruiting (sarcasm intended). I don't
 post
 on the internet, but those of you who do ought to use good judgment since
 stupid posts like that don't exactly help our image.

 Earl Anderson Commits to Horns; Lyle Sendlein Poised to Come Aboard

 Earl Anderson of San Marcos, the quickest big DT I've seen this year, says
 he
 has committed to Texas unofficially and will make it official Sunday when
 he
 comes to the Longhorns' first mini-camp.
 Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale Chaparral, another big DT prospect who is so
 fast
 he plays middle linebacker at his school, told me he also plans to commit
 at
 Sunday's camp "if they offer me a  scholarship." Don't worry, Lyle, your
 scholarship will be waiting for you.
 When Anderson and Sendlein commit officially on Sunday, it will give the
 Longhorns the lead in early recruiting in the Big 12 and start them on the

 way to a fourth straight top five national recruiting class.
 Anderson is the highest ranked Texas blue-chipper to pick a college. He is

 No. 3 on my 25-man "difference-maker" list, and Texas also has a
 commitment
 from OL Bret Valdez of Brownwood, who is No. 23 on that list. Sendlein is
 the
 top recruit in Arizona and, if he lived in Texas, he would be high in my
 top
 25.
 Anderson, who says he has grown an inch to 6-4 and now weighs 275, told me

 can still break 4.8 in the 40 on most days. "I ran a 4.78 the last time I
 was
 clocked," he said. "I want to stay below 4.8, so I'm watching my weight
 now."
 I was the first guy to give him a high ranking after seeing his incredible

 quickness last season.
 He said he picked Texas over Texas A&M, Florida State and others because
 UT
 "has the great combination of athletics and academics that I want and it's
 so
 close that my parents won't have to spend a lot of money traveling around
 to
 see me play."
 Besides that, he said, "I've always been a Longhorn fan."
 Sendlein comes from such a Longhorn family that his UT linebacker brother
 is
 named Austin. Their father, Robin, was a great linebacker at Texas and
 also
 played in the NFL for many years. He said he is 6-5, 275, and can run the
 40
 in 4.85. His Scottsdale team has gone 14-0 two straight years and his
 prowess
 as a defender is one of the main reasons for the team's success.
 Sendlein was being recruited by all the top schools in the Pac 10, plus
 Notre
 Dame, Nebraska, Michigan and Penn State.
 Coach Mack Brown said one of the Longhorns' top recruiting goals this year

 was to sign several top defensive linemen, and, while he can't comment on
 individual recruits,  Anderson and Sendlein are top-notch defensive line
 prospects.
 Another great defensive line prospect, Chase Pittman of Shreveport
 Evangel,
 came in at 6-4 1/2 and 261 and ran a 4.8 40 at a Nike camp at LSU
 recently,
 and he also bench pressed 185 pounds 36 times. No one else at the camp was

 able to bench press 185 pounds more than 22 times. Pittman bench pressed
 440
 pounds, a tremendous achievement for a high school junior, at a recent
 charity fund raising event at Evangel.
 He is the younger brother of Cole Pittman, the former UT defensive linemen

 who was killed in a tragic auto accident earlier this year while returning
 to
 Texas for spring training. He is considering Texas, LSU and Oklahoma.
 CB Donald Burgs of Houston Madison plans to come to the second UT
 mini-camp
 on June 10, and there is a good chance he will commit to the Longhorns. He
 is
 a big Texas fan who is No. 15 on my "difference-maker" list.

 FOOTBALL NOTES: A columnist for the Sporting News has picked Texas No. 1.
 I
 like his sentiments and I think the Longhorns will be one of the nation's
 elite teams this season, but it's tough to go all the way when you have to

 win your division of the Big 12, beat a team like Nebraska or Kansas State
 in
 the league championship game and then tame someone like Florida State or
 Miami in the Rose Bowl. Texas could do it, but so could several other
 teams.
 Darrell Royal won three national titles at Texas, but I always thought his

 1964 team might have been his best one. Bear Bryant probably thought so,
 too,
 because it beat his national championship Alabama team and Joe Namath in
 the
 Orange Bowl, but a one-point loss at Arkansas kept the Horns from
 repeating
 as national champs. The point of that flashback is that a team can be
 very, v
 ery good and still not win the national title.

Jerry Scarbrough's True Orange
The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful

Volume 10, No. 20, August 7, 2000

Strong Defense, Promising Offense, Favorable Schedule Propel Horns to No. 7
in First AP Poll

Coach Mack Brown says the Longhorns don't rate a top 10 ranking in the wake
of their three-game slide to end 1999, but the Associated Press pre-season
pollsters say the Horns are No. 7.
Brown and his staff have simply done such and outstanding  job of assemblin=
g
talent and building a solid foundation to be overlooked in the pre-season
voting.
The Longhorns haven't finished in the AP top 10 since 1983, but there are
four big reasons why they should end that 17-year drought this season.
First, the talent base is young, but it is outstanding. Brown's first group
of recruits will be juniors or redshirt sophomores this year and many of th=
em
have been playing =01) and playing well =01) since they were true freshmen.
Second, the defense was No. 6 in the nation last season, and it will be eve=
n
stingier this year.
Third, the offense will be a lot more consistent throughout this season
because there are so many more weapons at its disposal.
And last but certainly not least is the schedule.
Brown had to play Northern Division powers Nebraska (pre-season No. 1) and
Kansas State (pre-season No. 8) in 1998 and 1999. He went 2-2 against them =
in
the regular season, winning twice against Nebraska and losing two to K-Stat=
e.
The 2000 Longhorn schedule is no cakewalk. It includes a road game at No. 2=
4
Colorado, the annual Dallas grudge match with No. 19 Oklahoma and some othe=
r
dangerous dates.
But the early line has Texas favored in each of its 11 regular season games=
,
and that's something no Longhorn teams has had in its favor in at least 30
years.
As good as the Horns should be this year, next season should be their year =
to
really romp and stomp. Why? Because they have only five senior starters and
Brown will have four straight awesome recruiting classes ready to roll.
But this season can be a very good one, too. In addition to the high nation=
al
ranking in the pre-season polls, the Longhorns are heavy favorites to win t=
he
Southern Division of the Big 12 and set up a championship game with Nebrask=
a,
the Northern Division favorite and pre-season choice to win the national
title.
My theory is that the defense will be the best one Brown and his outstandin=
g
defensive coordinator, Carl Reese, have put on the field at Texas. That
should give the young offense time to reload before playing the really big
guys on the schedule.
With the Longhorns first three games against teams that will throw 50 passe=
s
a game (Louisiana-Lafayette, Stanford and Houston) even Reese's young
defensive ends won't be a liability because they are lightning fast pass
rushers, even if their run-stopping techniques do leave a little to be
desired.
Most of the other teams the Horns play during the regular season also are
pass-oriented because Oklahoma and Texas Tech are 50-pass teams, Missouri
probably will be and Oklahoma State, Colorado and Baylor probably will thro=
w
40 or more passes in most games.
I also think sophomore TE Bo Scaife and redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis wi=
th
a little help from dimunitive  sophomore WR Courtnee Garcia, will be able t=
o
slow down a lot of those blitzes that terrorized the Texas offense at the e=
nd
of last season by allowing 15 sacks in the final two games against Nebraska
and Arkansas.
The Longhorns have an embarrassment of riches at quarterback where co-Big 1=
2
Offensive Player of the Year Major Applewhite appears to healthy again afte=
r
knee surgery, but still might lose his job to immensely talented sophomore
Chris Simms.
Ditto at running back where senior Hodges Mitchell made the All-Big 12 team
last year and is being challenged by big, fast redshirt freshman Ivan
Williams, with sophomores Kenny Hayter and Victor Ike also in mix.
I can remember many past season when the Longhorns started and sometimes ev=
en
won with a starting tailback who wasn't as good as any of this group, and
neither the Longhorns nor anyone else in this area has ever had two QBs as
talented as Applewhite and Simms.
If we assume Scaife, Ellis and Garcia can fill the hole left by the
graduation of the team's top three receivers long enough for the talented
wide receiver recruits to start getting comfortable with the offense, then
the only real problem left is the offensive line.
I know it had problems in those final 10 quarters of the season, and I've
explained in detail in past issues while it wasn't all the linemen's fault,
but all of those guys are a year older now and should be a lot better this
year.
The only spot in the offensive line that really concerns me is right tackle=
.
The O-line did a good job during the first 11 games last year because UT wa=
s
No. 2 in the league in total offense until the receivers started getting
hurt, thus opening the door to more all-out blitzes.
The Longhorns even moved the ball well in the two losses in those first 11
games, but the problem at right tackle was exposed in one of those losses
when Kansas State forced six Texas turnovers by applying fearsome pressure
around the Horns' right side on virtually every pass play.
When Simms, a left-hander, is in the game, the right tackle will have to
protect his blind side.
Either Mike Williams or Cory Quye, who both started at times last year, mus=
t
step up this season, or the coaches might do what they have done to fix
problems in other areas =01) move someone from another position. Fullback t=
o
linebacker De'Andre Lewis and linebacker to fullback Matt Trissel are two
prime examples of moves that are paying dividends.
The prime candidate for a move could be guard Derrick Dockery, who coach
Brown called "the best freshman offensive lineman I've ever coached" last
year. With his quick feet, he would be an outside speed rusher's worst
nightmare.
That could open the door at guard to redshirt freshman Tillman Holloway, wh=
o
is the grandson of Longhorn legendary lineman Bud McFadin. Holloway is
talented and, like his grandfather was nearly 50 years ago, is a fierce
competitor. The offensive line could use another player whose competitive
juices run at a fever pitch.
One big problem for blitzers, even if the problems at right tackle persist,
will be Scaife. Nebraska and Arkansas were so good at delaying the Longhorn
receivers at the line of scrimmage that they often brought eight and
sometimes even  nine pass rushers.
If anyone ever brings nine this season, the other two defenders will try to
chuck the two wide receivers, and Scaife probably will score a touchdown if
Applewhite or Simms has a split second to toss him a short pass because the=
re
are few defenders who can run him down.
If they bring eight guys, Ellis is 6-4 and Scaife is 6-3, and both are fast=
er
than Kwame Cavil, the team's ace receiver last season. Cavil was a great
receiver, but, at 6-2, he was the only tall target among the key receiving
corps last season.
Tall receivers are able to take advantage of short cornerbacks in all-out
blitz situations. Remember that third-and-long pass the tall Arkansas
receiver caught over the short Texas cornerback after the Horns' two obviou=
s
safeties didn't count? That was the difference in that game.
So, my contention is that blitzing is not going to work as well against UT =
as
it did late last season.
The Big 12 had five teams in the AP's pre-season top 25, headed by No. 1
Nebraska. Texas followed at No. 7, one step ahead of No. 8 Kansas State.
Oklahoma was rated at No. 19 and Colorado came in at No. 24.
After facing lots of ranked teams in his first two years at Texas, Brown wi=
ll
face only two top 25 teams during the regular season this year.
Other than the big games against the Sooners and Buffaloes, the most
dangerous games for Texas during the regular season probably will be Texas
Tech in Lubbock, Stanford in Palo Alto and Texas A&M in Austin.

Freshmen Report Sunday

The freshmen report to campus next Sunday, August 13.
The freshmen will practice Monday through Wednesday, August 14-16, at Frank
Denius Fields (corner of 26th and Red River).
The veterans will report on August 16.
UT's first full-team practice is slated for Friday, August 18, at Whitaker
Field (51st and Guadalupe). The team will continue to practice at Whitaker
Field until school starts, at which time the practices will return to Deniu=
s.
All preseason practices are open to the public. Coach Mack Brown has not
released a full practice schedule, but, in the past, his morning practices
started around 8:30 and his evening practices began around 5 p.m.

Brown's Observations

Coach Mack Brown was upbeat about the Longhorns prospects at the Big 12 med=
ia
meetings in Kansas City last week, but he also said the team has to get
better in every area.
Here are some of the highlights of his comments:
On last season
"We did not start like we wanted to last year and we did not finish well, b=
ut
we had a real good football team during the interim, from game two through
game eleven."
On overall needs
"We need to continue to work to develop depth on our team. The Big 12 is a
physical league and it gets hot in Austin, so we have to be at least two de=
ep
at every position. We played 14 games last season and we got tired. We have
to develop more depth, so we can play more people and not wear down during
the season."
On the offense
"We need to continue to work to run the ball better and we have to be more
patient in games when we're playing against great defenses. We don't have t=
o
score every time, but we do have to make some plays and take care of the ba=
ll
better. We don't want to put our defense in bad situations."
On the defense
"We've got a really good defense, but we feel like we gave up too many big
plays at the end of the season. We've got to work on getting better at
cutting down on the big plays and we need to get a better pass rush out of
our front four so we don't have to blitz all the time."
On special teams
"We told your team it's not against the rules to return punts or kickoffs.
We've got to do a better job in those areas, and we're working on it. Our n=
et
punting needs to be better and we need to do a better job in punt-blocking
situations."
On the pressure to win at Texas
"I got more pressure at North Carolina in my last year being 8-0 and then
losing to Florida State than I got after the three losses as the end of las=
t
year. We lost those three games at the end and didn't look very good in som=
e
of them and I didn't do a good job in some of them, but I've gotten more
support from the university and our fans than anywhere else I've ever
coached. The fans want us to win every game, and I want expectations to be
high. If you're at Texas, you want to win the national championship and you
need to have a goal to win the national championship and you need to have a
dream to win the national championship."
On the No. 7 ranking in the pre-season AP poll
"Expectations are high, but that's a good thing. The only reason we're rank=
ed
that high is because we're Texas. We're not as good as the expectations and
the ranking right now, but we hope to grow into it."

12 Early Commitments Have Texas Among Nation's Elite

The early recruiting blitz coach Mack Brown and his staff have worked to ne=
ar
perfection in reeling in three nationally ranked recruiting classes in
succession is paying off again.
Texas is up to 12 early commitments now, and appears headed for another top=
 5
national class after getting CB Cedric Griffin, 6-1, 180, 4.42, of San
Antonio Holmes and OL Terrance Young, 6-6, 340, 5.5, of Longview, both in
July.
The Longhorn coaches can't comment on their recruits until they sign in
February, but Griffin, the top prospect in San Antonio, said the UT coaches
told him they wanted him "because they said I had the size, speed and
athletic ability they were looking for in their cornerbacks."
He had 41 tackles last season, broke up 14 passes and had three
interceptions, two of which he returned for touchdowns.
Holmes' coach, David Sanchez, said Griffin "is the best cover corner in the
district. We went 13-2 last year and reached the state Class 5A semi-finals=
,
and his ability to take the other team's best receiver out of the game was =
a
big reason."
Griffin, who has run a 10.5 100 meters, said he had offers from Texas A&M,
Oklahoma, Colorado and Arkansas before he got a scholarship offer from Texa=
s
on an unofficial visit on July 18, and he said he didn't waste any time
taking the UT offer.
"I knew all along that Texas is where I wanted to go," he said. "I really
like Texas' style of play and I was really impressed with the way the Texas
coaches stress academics as well as athletics.
Young also had plenty of offers =01) Miami, UCLA, Notre Dame, Arkansas, Tex=
as
A&M, LSU and Mississippi State =01) before he drove to Austin on July 29 wi=
th
his parents, met with Brown and assistant coaches Darryl Drake and Tim Nune=
z
and committed. Drake recruits East Texas and Nunez is the offensive line
coach.
Like Griffin, he said the Longhorn offer was the one he was waiting on. "I
really like Texas," he said.
"They have great coaches and great kids, and they are going to do some grea=
t
things in the next few years. I want to be a part of that."
Young, who already is a full qualifier with fine grades and and a 980 SAT a=
nd
21 ACT score, said the Texas coaches told him they like the way he gets a
quick jump on the defensive linemen and then maintains his blocks.
For those of you who are concerned about that 5.5 time in the 40, don't wor=
ry
about it. Young has a very quick start for a big offensive lineman and is
adept at picking off speed rushers from the outside of his offensive tackle
spot.
How fast an offensive lineman gets started is a lot more important than his
40 time, and Young gets started in a hurry.
Longview coach Pat Collins, who coached an NCAA Division II national title
team at Northeast Louisiana before getting back into the high school coachi=
ng
ranks, said, "The Longhorns got a great football player and a great young m=
an
with an outstanding family."
Collins said Young "Is one of the best high school prospects I have seen or
coached. he has worked really hard this summer and has excellent mobility a=
nd
agility."
Seven of the Longhorns' 12 commitments are offensive linemen. Texas has
signed only three offensive linemen in each of Brown's three previous
recruiting classes and he said heading into this recruiting season that the
offensive line was the No. 1 priority.
Since this is the best group of offensive linemen since I started doing thi=
s
back in 1990, he couldn't have picked a better year to clean up on the big
guys.
Here's a list of the Horns' early commitments:

Offensive Line (7)
Jonathan Scott, 6-7, 290, 4.9, Dallas Carter, a national top 100 player.
Abe Robinson, 6-6, 270, 4.9, Jersey Village, another national top 100 playe=
r.
Alfio Randall, 6-6, 300, 5.1, Blinn JC, was a national top 100 player two
years ago.
Mike Garcia, 6-5, 280, 5.2, Galena Park, broke the Aggies' hearts by changi=
ng
his early commitment to Texas.
Will Allen, 6-5, 300, 5.2, Cypress Falls, is another highly recruited star.
Roman Reeves, 6-6, 295, 5.2, another of the state's top eight offensive
linemen.
Terrance Young, 6-6, 340, 5.5, Longview.

Linebacker (1)
Yamil LeBron, 6-2, 240, 4.7, Killeen Ellison, was the middle backer the
Longhorns targeted early.

Defensive Back (4)
Cedric Griffin, 6-1, 180, 4.42, San Antonio Holmes, one of the state's top
two cornerbacks.
Kendal Briles, 5-10, 175, 4.5, Wolfforth Frenship, a great option QB who wi=
ll
play safety at Texas.
Braden Johnson, 6-2, 200, 4.5, Euless Trinity, a fine athlete who will play
QB this season.
Brian Carter, 5-11, 180, 4.5, The Woodlands, a two-way star at WR and CB.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: Matt Nordgren, the Dallas Bishop Lynch star who is easily
the state's top QB prospect, is still a big Texas fan, but he isn't through
looking around. He and his parents took an unofficial visit to Texas A&M
Saturday, and he and his father will fly to Colorado this weekend for anoth=
er
unofficial visit. Nordgren said he liked A&M and had a good time, "but Texa=
s
is still No. 1. I really like the Longhorns." I'm pretty sure he'll commit =
to
Texas later this month. . . While things are still looking bright for the
state's best QB, it's no quite that rosy for the top RB, Cedric Benson of
Midland Lee. He has been a Texas fan and has talked about committing early =
to
the Longhorns, but now he says he doesn't want to commit this summer and
wants to wait take some official visits to other top programs before making
his choice. . . The Longhorn signees made good showings in the Texas High
School All-Star Game in Houston last week. QB Chance Mock of The Woodlands
led the North to a 17-13 victory by throwing two touchdown passes and was
named the MVP, an honor his father, Mike, won back in 1974 as a star QB fro=
m
Longview. The Mocks are the first father-son duo in Texas history to win MV=
P
awards in the North-South game. Matt McFadden of Coppell kicked off deep,
booted a field goal and even punted, something he didn't do in high school.
Tony Jeffery of Klein Forest, playing WR, and Nathan Vasher of Texarkana,
playing WR and CB, showed superb athletic ability for the North. C Tre Bate=
s
of Fort Bend Austin and T Lionel Garr of Diboll did a good job of blocking,
and DT Sonny Davis of Austin Lanier, another UT signee who is headed to
junior college, looked great. If you watched the game, you know why Davis w=
as
so heralded. Packing about 30 excess pounds on his normal 6-1, 310-pound
frame, he still was the quickest big man on either team. Let's hope he gets
his JC degree, sheds those excess pounds to get even quicker and returns to
Texas in two years. RB Sneezy Beltran of Abilene was more tentative than he
had been in his games at Abilene, but I have seen enough tape of his exploi=
ts
to know he is the real deal. . . So far, six members of the first team on
Dave Campbell's Texas Football magazine's Super Team have committed to
colleges. Running back David Underwood of Madisonville committed to Michiga=
n
and the other five =01) Briles, Robinson, Scott, Young and Griffin =01) com=
mited to
UT. . . The nation's top FB, James Buchanan, 6-2, 240, 4.7, of Sarasota,
Fla., Cardinal Mooney, ranks UT in his top three with Florida State and
Miami, and one of the top DEs in the nation, Shaun Cody, 6-5, 255, 4.6, of
Los Altos High in Hacienda Heights, Cal., who had 29 sacks last season, say=
s
he will visit Texas. . . Look for the Horns to sign between 22 and 25
recruits.

Brown Says Applewhite, Freshmen WRs Will Start at Colorado

The quarterback shuffle is over and the blue-chip freshmen wide receivers
are
ready for prime time, coach Mack Brown said Tuesday in announcing Major
Applewhite as the starting quarterback against Colorado and Roy Williams
and
B. J. Johnson as the starting wide receivers.
Brown said sophomore Chris Simms probably will play, too, but he said
Applewhite will be the starter.
He also said Hodges Mitchell will continue to start at tailback, but said
he
and sophomore Kenny Hayter will alternate.
"When you play as poorly across the board as we did Saturday, you need to
make some changes to try to improve what you are doing," he said.
Brown said the team also showed a lot of spark in its first workout since
the
devastating loss to Oklahoma Saturday. "They have a lot of pride," he said,
"
and they are not pleased with the way they played in Dallas."
The Longhorns might have four starting wide receivers because they worked a
lot on the shotgun formation with four wideouts Tuesday. That has been the
team's most productive formation because the Horns haven't been able to run
the ball consistently and that formation gives the quarterbacks more time
to
pass.
Brown also  said DT Shaun Rogers, who has missed the last two games with a
sprained ankle, will be able to play. He still isn't participating in
contact
drills, but Brown said he should be available to play at least part of the
game.
With Williams and Johnson moving into the starting lineup, the Horns now
have
three true freshmen starting because Kalen Thornton has been starting at
defensive end for the last two games.
Brown said he wanted to address the offensive changes Tuesday, and said he
will announce any defensive changes on Wednesday. The defense had been
playing well all year, but it had a bad day against Oklahoma.
* * * *
Texas won its first four games against Colorado, but has lost six straight
to
the Buffs since 1989. Brown was asked why he thinks Texas has had trouble
with Colorado in recent years. Noting that Colorado won a national title in
1990, Brown said, "They probably were just bettter than we were in some of
those years."
Texas has not played Colorado since Brown came to Texas.
The Buffaloes are a 1-point favorite over the Longhorns this year.
* * * *
BUFFALO NOTES: Colorado coach Gary Barnett, noting the 63-14 whipping
Oklahoma put on the Longhorns, said he asked his players Monday "How would
you like to be in that (Texas) meeting room today?" He said one of his
players replied, "Coach, we were in that meeting room a week ago." Kansas
State had handed the Buffs their fourth straight loss the previous week. .
.
Colorado is one of only four schools to ever win six straight games against
Texas. The others are Oklahoma, Texas A&M and Southern Methodist. If
Colorado
wins Saturday, the Buffaloes will be the only school to ever beat the
Longhorns seven straight imes.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTE: QB Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch  told me tonight
he
might take until Monday to make his decision on a college choice. He said
it
will probably be either Texas or LSU, with Colorado and Tennessee also
still
in the running.

Quan Cosby Signs 5-Year Pact with Angels, Gives Up Football

Quan Cosby of Mart, one of the Longhorns' prize recruits, signed a
five-year
baseball contract with the California Angels and said his football playing
days are over.
It came as a shock to the Longhorn coaches and to me and most other
Longhorns. You just don't expect a sixth-round draft choice to get enough
money to give up football. But Cosby told me he got close to first-round
money. "I told them what it would take for me to give up football, and
that's
what they came up with," he said.
Cosby, a fleet wide receiver who was expected to see action at Texas this
season, said baseball is "easier on the body, so I probably will be able to
play baseball longer than I could have played football."
Asked if he might return to Texas to play football if his baseball career
doesn't work out as planned, he said, "That's a possibility, but I'm
figuring
on playing baseball for a long time."
Texas A&M QB Marki Farris is an example of a player who tried pro baseball,
then returned to play college football after several years.
Cosby declined to say how much he signed for, but did say it included
tuition
and fees to attend Texas for four years to get his degree.
UT head coach Mack Brown said, "The reason a young man comes to college is
to
better his life and we gave Quan an opportunity to do that. If he feels it
is
better for him to play professional baseball, then we are excited for him.
We're disappointed short-term that he will not be coming to Texas this
fall,
but if he ever decides he wants to give up baseball and come to college
we'd
be happy to have him."
* * * *
Cosby's decision to go the pro baseball route probably will mean the
Longhorns will try to sign three wide receivers this year. They had homed
in
on Marquis Johnson of Champaign, Illinois, and Anthony Wright of Klein
Forest, but they probably will step up their efforts on Xavier McQuire of
Dallas Carter and DaBryan Blanton of Forney. Blanton is a running back at
Forney, but his slight build and blazing speed (20.37 fully automatic 200
meters at the state meet) will see him move to wide receiver or cornerback
at
the next level.
McQuire was at the Texas summer camp that ended today (Wednesday) and he
said
he had a good time, but was still considering several schools.
DE Dontriel Coates, 6-3, 270, 4.8, of Anahuac, attended the Texas mini-camp
Sunday and is being recruited by the Longhorns. He says his big three are
Kentucky, Texas and Arkansas. On tape, he looks like a fine outside pass
rusher. Like DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos, a Longhorn pledge, he has an
explosive start.
The Longhorns didn't appear to get any additional commitments Wednesday,
but
that could change Thursday when all the kids get home. I told you in my
last
e-mail/fax about the new NCAA rule interpretation that prohibits coaches
taking commitments at summer camps.
Texas has four early commitments. In addition to Anderson, they are DT Lyle
Sendlein of Scottsdale, Arizona, DT  Sonny Davis, who is attending junior
college in Mississippi after graduating from Austin Lanier, and  OL Brett
Valdez of Brownwood.
* * * *
Marc Pittman, father of Cole Pittman, the UT defensive tackle who was
killed
in an automobile accident in February, was at the Longhorn practice
Wednesday
with his other son, DE Chase Pittman, a top 100 national recruit, plus
several other Shreveport Evangel stars, including John David Booty, a  6-2,
195-pound quarterback who might be the nation's top sophomore prospect, and
another outstanding sophomore, DE Chris Bowers, 6-3, 232. He also brought
two
top defensive backs who are being highly recruited from Evangel. They are
Jonathan Wade, 5-10, 175, 4.3 (he ran a 10.25 100 meters in April), and
Chad
Johnson, 5-11, 185, 4.4.
* * * *
BASEBALL NOTES: James Sweeney, the outstanding catcher Texas signed, has
inked a pro contract, and  Vincent Sinisi, the top slugger the Horns signed
a
year ago, has transferred to Rice after redshirting this year at Texas
because of persistent problems with a rib injury.

Longhorns Will Face Pac-10 Tri-Champion
Oregon in Culligan Holiday Bowl December 29

The 12th-ranked Longhorns, who haven't finished in the AP top 10 since 1983=
,
can wipe out 17 years of frustration on Dec. 29 in San Diego by beating No.=
 8
Oregon in the Culligan Holiday Bowl.
While that's easy to say, it will be much harder to accomplish. The Ducks
went 9-2 overall and tied BCS-bowl teams Washington and Oregon State for th=
e
Pac 10 championship with a 7-1 record. Texas has the same overall and leagu=
e
record at 9-2 and 6-1.
The Holiday Bowl game starts at 7:30 p.m. Texas time and will be nationally
televised by ESPN.
Now, before I get back to the matchup, let me urge all Longhorn fans to buy
tickets and attend this game.
Why? Because one major criteria for getting one of the eight elite BCS bowl
bids is fan loyalty. The Longhorn team forgot to show up for the Cotton Bow=
l
last year and so did Longhorn fans, who didn't fill their ticket quota.
Bowl folks notice things like that. Coach Mack Brown has Texas poised for a
long run at top 10 status and our fans need to be in the top 10, too, to he=
lp
the team land good bowl games.
So please buy some tickets (the information  is on page 2) and take a few
days to enjoy San Diego. It will help the Longhorns in this bowl game and i=
t
will help them get in future ones.
That's it with the sermon. Let's get back to the bowl matchup.
Brown called the game "an exciting matchup and a great challenge for both
programs."
"Both teams are very well respected state institutions with a great deal of
pride and tradition," Brown said. He also called Oregon's coach, Mike
Bellotti, "a personal friend," and said "he has done a great job of buildin=
g"
that program.
Bellotti boats a 48-22 record in six season at Oregon and has taken the Duc=
ks
to bowl games in five of his six years at the helm.
Oregon has lost only eight games in the last three years, going 8-3 in 1998=
,
9-3 in 1999 and 9-2 in 2000.
Oregon was picked to finish in the middle of the pack in the Pac 10 after
racking up nine wins in 1999 with a senior-laden team.
But Bellotti rebuilt his offense around strong-armed junior QB Joey
Harrington, 6-4, 210, and junior college transfer RB Maurice Morris, 6-0,
205, and found competent replacements for eight lost defensive starters to
produce a surprisingly good team that lost only two games all season.
Harrington completed 195 of 375 passes (52%) and the Ducks ranked 25th
nationally in passing with 257.7 yards per game.
Harrington threw 20 touchdown passes while being intercepted 13 times.
Morris filled the void at running back by averaging 100.5 yards a game. He
ran for 1,106 yards and eight touchdowns.
Senior WR Marshaun Tucker, 5-10, 185, was the team's leading receiver with =
50
receptions for 871 yards and six touchdowns. Sophomore WR Keenon Howry, a
5-10, 165-pound speedster, is another outstanding receiver.
Defensively, tackles Jason Nikolao, 6-2, 300, and Jed Boice, 6-4, 295, end
Saul Patu, 6-3, 265, and LB Matt Smith, 6-4, 247, are the team leaders.
The Ducks' defensive philosophy is to "stop the run and don't get beat deep
on pass plays."
Let's hope they don't make that work in the Holiday Bowl because the Horns
live on beating people deep on pass plays, and they also like to run the
football.
The Ducks beat Rose Bowl representative Washington, 23-16, during the regul=
ar
season and were undefeated in the Pac 10 until the final week of the regula=
r
season when they lost to arch-rival Oregon State, 23-13.
Their only other loss was in their second game to then No. 4-ranked
Wisconsin, 27-23.
Their other victories were over Nevada, 36-7; Idaho, 42-13; UCLA, 29-10; US=
C,
28-17; Arizona, 14-10, Arizona State, 56-55; Washington State, 27-24, and
California, 25-17.
The wins over Arizona State and Washington State were in overtime.
The Longhorns have won six games in a row after a 3-2 start and they can be=
at
the Ducks and make it seven in a row if they can win four key battles.
To win, the Longhorns have to be able to run the ball better than the Ducks=
,
they have to get a fast start offensively, they must win the turnover battl=
e
and they have to get another great effort from their outstanding defense.
Against Texas A&M, the Longhorns got a terrible start offensively and faile=
d
to even make a first down in the first quarter.
But they were able to keep the early lead because safety Greg Brown scored =
on
a 10-yard pass interception on the Aggies' first offensive plays.
They probably won't be able to count on scoring a quick defensive touchdown
against Oregon, which is why getting a fast start offensively is one of the
main keys to the game's outcome.
Here's how the teams compared statistically at the end of the regular seaso=
n
(national rank in parenthesis):

Coaches Waiting for a Few Top Recruits to Come Aboard

Coach Mack Brown and his assistant coaches already have enough top recruits
to assure them of their third straight top 10 class, and it could challenge
for the top spot again if things fall right.
Texas has 19 commitments already (the list is on page 4), and the Horns
probably will sign six or seven more players.
The Longhorns will challenge for the No. 1 spot again if most of them come
from a group of nine top national recruits that includes DT Tommie Harris o=
f
Killeen Ellison, LB Derrick Johnson of Waco, OL Jami Hightower of
Jacksonville, S Derrick Johnson of Temple, Ath Quan Cosby of Mart, DE
Jonathan Jackson and TE James Moses, both of Galena Park North Shore, OL
William Winston of Houston Madison and DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia, Cal.
The good news in this recruiting season is that Texas has cleaned up in eve=
ry
critical area except the defensive line. That makes the bad news pretty
obvious: if Texas doesn't sign both Harris and Jakes, the class will come u=
p
short in the big guys up front in the defensive line.
But even that cloud has a silver lining. This was the year of the offensive
lineman in Texas. Next year will be the year of the defensive lineman. Ther=
e a
re more good ones than I have seen in several years.
The Longhorns cleaned up on offensive linemen this year and they should be
able to clean up on defensive linemen next year.
I have already seen four junior defensive tackles who are better than anybo=
dy
except Harris in this year's senior class.
I spotted one of them, Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings, the first week of
the season when I went to Houston to watch the Galena Park North
Shore-Hastings game.
I was there primarily to look at Jackson and Moses, but Wright was the most
dominant player on the field. At 6-5 and 315 pounds, he was able  to stuff
the run and he showed the quickness and upper body strength to get off bloc=
ks
quickly and rush the passer.
Mesquite's Marco Martin, 6-4, 285, 4.7, is generally regarded as the state'=
s
top defensive line prospect next recruiting season. He is so quick he doubl=
es
as a running back.
But Wright is the most physical defensive tackle I have seen in the junior
ranks. Suffice it to say that both Wright and Martin will be top national
recruits next year.
Wright's 40 time is in the 5.0 to 5.1 range, but he has as much quickness
over 10 to 15 yards, the key distance for defensive tackles, as any of the
guys who might outrun him in a 40.
The other two top junior DTs I have seen this year are Earl Anderson, 6-4,
275, 4.9, of San Marcos, and Patrick Lee, 6-4, 295, 5.0, Dallas Carter.
The Longhorns will have great shots at Wright, Anderson and Lee, who all li=
st
Texas among their favorites. They also will be in the hunt for Martin.
While I have only seen them on tape, there are several other junior DTs who
will be highly recruited next year.
They include Damon Brown, 6-4, 260, 4.9, of Houston Washington; Tully
Jontzen, 6-3, 270, 4.9, of Keller; Jarre Rhodes, 6-4, 260, 4.9, of Dallas
Lincoln, and David Johnson, 6-3, 270, 5.0, of Aldine Nimitz.
Since the Longhorns are down to recruiting a handful of players to complete
this year's recruiting class, let's look for a moment at some of the other
top juniors who will be the "difference makers" next year.
There are two junior QBs college coaches everywhere know about. They are
Reggie McNeal, 6-3, 180, 4.6, of Lufkin, and Vincent Young, 6-5, 200, 4.5, =
of
Houston Madison. McNeal is Arkansas' No. 1 recruiting target in Texas next
year.
Both are outstanding runners who also have strong arms.
TE Eric Winston, 6-6, 270, 5.0, is the second best player at Midland Lee,
behind super senior RB Cedric Benson, who is committed to Texas. Winston is=
 a
devastating blocker who probably will move to the offensive line in college=
.
He is a strong A&M lean and has been to the Aggies' summer camp.
Travis Leitko, 6-5, 255, 4.7, of The Woodlands, is an outstanding defensive
end. If he was a senior this year, he would have colleges from everywhere
clamoring for his signature.
At LB, Marvin Byrdsong, 6-3, 240, 4.5, of Longview; Andy Matakis, 6-3, 225,
4.6, of Corpus Christi Flower Bluff and Archie McDaniel, 6-3, 225, 4.7, of
Bay City, are already established stars.
L'Tydrick Riley, 6-4, 215, 4.5, of Crockett, who also plays QB very well,
Kendrick Muckelroy, 6-0, 190, 4.4, of Hallsville, and Michael Cuba, 6-3, 19=
0,
4.5, of Taylor, are great safety prospects as juniors.
Now let's get back to this year's recruits.
I thought Benson and Midland Lee might be in trouble Saturday against
defensive powerhouse Duncanville, which hadn't allowed any team to score mo=
re
than 17 points all year.
Benson, the Energizer Bunny of the high school running backs, carried 35
times for 200 yards and four touchdowns and scored another TD on a 51-yard
screen pass to pace the Rebels to a 44-9 victory.
Benson now ranks No. 5 among all the high school running backs in Texas
history in yardage gained with 8,076. He is the only Class 5A rusher in Cla=
ss
5A in the top 20.
Kenneth Hall, the Class B terror at Sugar Land from 1950 through 1953, hold=
s
the record at 11,232 yards. He was an amazing runner, but he never ran
against the kind of defenses Benson faces every week.
Benson has led Midland Lee to back-to-back state champsionships, but he los=
t
most of his supporting cast after last season and the Rebels looked
vulnerable this season, losing two early-season games.
But his rebuilt line is getting better every week and Duncanville coach Bob
Alpert, who has been coaching at the 5A level in Texas for many years, firs=
t
in the Houston area and now in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, has seen an=
d
played against a lot of great running backs, but he says Benson is in a cla=
ss
by himself.
"He's the best high school running back I've seen, and he's by far the best
one that one of my teams has had to try to stop," Alpert said.
What makes Benson so special?
"It doesn't take a rocket scientist," Alpert said. "He's got great vision,
he's really quick through the hole, he can get something if there isn't muc=
h
there, he's hard to bring down and he has great, really great balance. He's
also got really good speed, and he runs as hard on his 30th carry as he doe=
s
on his first one."
And, of course, the high school coach to end all  high school coaches, the
legendary Gordon Wood, long retired after winning state titles galore at
Stamford and Brownwood, put his stamp of approval on Benson after his junio=
r
year, saying, "Benson is the best all-around high school running back I've
ever seen."
I've moved Benson to the top spot on my "difference maker" list on the
previous page. With endorsements from guys like Wood and Alpert, he's
obviously an awesome prospect.
By the way, an interesting and fairly obscure note on Wood's career is that
he's the guy who ended the Breckinridge dynasty in Texas.
If you remember Chuck Moser and his mighty Abilene Eagle dynasty and its
multi-year winning streak in the 1950s, there is a connection to Breckinrid=
ge
there, too.
The reason Abilene won all those games in a row was that the Eagles quit
playing Breckinridge. That long winning streak started the week after
Breckinridge thumped Abilene by three touchdowns. I think the score was
34-13, and it was a whipping.
But the team Breckinridge really had the hex on was Brownwood. The Lions ha=
d
never beaten Breckinridge and it was a really sore topic of conversation
around Brownwood.
Back in those days, Class 4A was the big school class. Abilene was Class 4A
and Breckinridge was Class 3A. Both teams won state regularly.
But Breckinridge fell down to Class 2A one year, and fell into Stamford's
district. Wood's Stamford team beat the Buckaroos that year en route to
another state title.
Folks in Brownwood noticed that the little 2A school was 1-0 against the te=
am
it had never beaten and they hired Wood, hoping he could do the same thing
for them.
Did he ever. Brownwood started beating Breckinridge every year and winning
state titles almost every year. The Buckaroos still have some good teams, b=
ut
they are in Class 3A now and happy they don't play the Class 4A Lions now,
even with Wood long retired.
Pardon me for drifting back so far, but I grew up in West Texas when it had
the best football played, and teams like Abilene and Breckinridge got
everyone's attention before giving way to Gordon Wood and his powerhouse Br
ownwood teams.
* * * *
So far, eight members of  Dave Campbell's Texas Football magazine's 24-man
Super Team have committed to colleges, and the Longhorns have six of them.
Benson is the only high school player ever to grace the cover of the state'=
s
top football magazine and he is joined on the Super Team by fellow UT
commitments Frenship QB Kendal Briles, San Antonio Holmes CB Cedric Griffin=
,
and OLs Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter, Terrance Young of Longview and Abe
Robinson of Jersey Village.
The other Super Team  players who have committed are Madisonville RB David
Underwood, who says he will sign with Michigan, and Lancaster WR Armon
Dorrough, who has given his pledge to Texas Tech.
Briles threw three touchdown passes and ran for a fourth score to lead
Frenship to a 42-6 victory over Fort Worth Wyatt in the Class 4A regional
finals Saturday.
Briles, who led Stephenville to the Class 4A state title last year, is
threatening to do the same thing at Frenship. He needs just two more
victories to accomplish that rare and possibly unprecedented feat.
If UT has a shaky commitment, it would be Briles. He was recruited by Texas
as an athlete, probably a safety, and he says he still thinks about going
somewhere like Nebraska to get a shot at playing QB.
* * * *
There is always a chance that lightning will strike and the Longhorns will
get a commitment from some blue chipper from out of the blue.
If it happens, it probably will be DT Marquise Hill, 6-7, 300, 5.0, of New
Orleans De La Salle.
Michigan has a big lead over LSU, but he says he probably will take a trip =
to
Texas just to be sure.
He's a long, long shot, but if he does take the trip to Texas, it could
happen. Brown and his staff don't miss on many guys who take official visit=
s.
The 56-visit limit rule isn't one that UT coaches even consider. They
normally bring in about 32 kids, offer about 28 of them and sign about 25 o=
f
them.
* * * *
Look for all of the UT commitments except DE Eric Hall of Tennessee, who ha=
s
already visited, and possibly Benson and Briles, who might be playing for
repeat state championships that weekend, to take their official visits to
Texas the Dec. 15 weekend to attend the Texas football banquet. Most of the
other players Texas is recruiting also will take their visits that weekend.

Scouting Missouri

Texas hosts Missouri Saturday at 1:30 p.m. in a game that will not be
televised.
The Tigers have been an unpredictable team this year, playing Nebraska and
Michigan State tough, and getting blown out by Kansas last week.
Missouri opened the season with a 50-20 win over Western Illinois, lost to
Clemson, 62-9, then played Michigan State down to the wire before losing,
13-10. The Tigers played Nebraska tough the next week before losing, 42-24,
then whipped Oklahoma State, 24-10, and lost to Kansas, 38-17.
Longhorn coach Mack Brown said he watched part of the Nebraska-Missouri gam=
e
"and I thought they had a chance to beat Nebraska in Lincoln while I was
watching it."
TB Zain Gilmore, a 6-1, 222-pound junior is the Tigers' top rusher. He is
averaging 55.3 yards per game rushing and has scored six touchdowns.
Freshman QB Darius Outlaw, 6-4, 193, is filling in for injured starter Kirk
Farmer and has completed 38 of 76 passes for 489 yards and three touchdowns=
.
But he also has been picked off seven times.
Defensively, the Tigers are led by All-Big 12 DE Justin Smith, a 6-5,
265-pound terror.
Coach Larry Smith has five offensive and six defensive starters back from a
4-7 team a year ago.
This is a game the Longhorns will be favored to win by at least 15 points,
and it is one they should win handily if they come out ready to play.

Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):

Texas                               Missouri
Offense
(98)     93.3        Rushing Avg.          (78) 120.7
(12)   292.3         Passing Avg.          (58) 210.5

(18)   34.7              Scoring Avg           (71)   22.3

Big 12 Roundup

Oklahoma showed it is ready to challenge for the top spot in the Big 12 las=
t
week by going to Manhattan and handing No. 2 Kansas State a 41-31 whipping.
The Sooners are firmly in the driver's seat in the Big 12 Southern Division=
,
while top-ranked Nebraska and Kansas State will meet later this season to
determine the Northern Division champion.
Conventional wisdom holds that two league losses eliminate a team from
championship competition.
If that is the case, then half the teams in each division have already been
eliminated, leaving Oklahoma, Texas and Texas A&M as the teams in the
Southern Division with legitimate title hopes and top-ranked Nebraska, Kans=
as
State and Iowa State as the teams witha chance to win the Northern Division
championship.
At least one of the contenders will fall by the wayside this week when Texa=
s
A&M travels to Ames to take on surprising Iowa State.
Other interesting games this week include Colorado at Kansas, Texas Tech at
Kansas State and Missouri at Texas.

Recruiting Roundup

There have been a lot of people who have been saying the disaster in Dallas
will damage UT recruiting.
But the week between the disaster and the victory over Colorado was one of
the best of this recruiting season for the Longhorns.
The Texas coaches got commitments last week from a great JC punter, the
state's best QB and one of the top DE/LB prospects in the country.
The latest Longhorn pledge is DE/LB Eric Hall  of Clarksville, Tenn. He
actually plays quarterback and safety at Clarksville, but Texas, Nebraska,
Tennessee and Texas A&M were all recruiting him primarily as a defensive en=
d.
He said he picked Texas because he was born in Texas and has always had a
fondness for the state and for its state university. "I really enjoyed my
official visit to Texas," he said. "I just decided it was the place for me.=
"
Hall was the 19th commitment for the Longhorns. who also had picked up
pledges last week from QB Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch and punter
Brian Bradford of  Trinity Valley JC.
Nordgren is easily the top pro-type passer in Texas and Bradford has been
rated as the nation's top JC punter by at least one recruiting service.
Nordgren  chose Texas over LSU, Tennessee and Colorado. He also was recruit=
ed
by most of the top programs, but had narrowed his choices to those four
schools. He told me had had 21 scholarship offers.
"It was really a close call between Texas and LSU," he said, "but I decided=
 I
wanted to play for the Longhorns."
Nordgren is a 4.0 student who also is a 6-6 high-jumper and 39.5 intermedia=
te
hurdler in track. He also starts for the basketball team.
=01&It came down to a great list of schools," Nordgren said, "but I felt at=
 home
at the UT campus. It=01,s a football program that I know I can help lead to=
 a
national championship."
Trinity Valley JC coach Chuck Langston says Bradford, "will punt in the NFL
someday. He's the best one I've ever been around."
Langston, who played and later coached at Oklahoma, said, "He's better than
any of the ones we ever had at OU when I was there. He averages better than
43 yards and he gets tremendous hang time, in the 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 (second)
range, which is really outstanding. He really gets great height and great
distance."
Langston said Bradford "is our team's MVP. He's one of the those guys who
turns the field over. He really changes field position."
Bradford told me he has "always wanted to play for the Longhorns." He was a
full qualifier out of Lufkin High School and said he will transfer to Texas
in January so he can go through spring training with the Longhorns.
Bradford can be counted against last year's class because he will enroll at
mid-year.
What I really like about Bradford is his emphasis on hang time. "I
concentrate on kicking it high," he said. "I'd rather have a 40-yarder with
no return than a 55-yarder that might be returned."
It obviously works out because he is averaging 43+ yards per kick, and stil=
l
getting close to five seconds hang time.
Here's a list of the Horns' 19 early commitments:
Offensive Line (7)
Jonathan Scott, 6-7, 290, 4.9, Dallas Carter
Abe Robinson, 6-6, 270, 4.9, Jersey Village
Alfio Randall, 6-6, 300, 5.1, Blinn JC
Mike Garcia, 6-5, 280, 5.2, Galena Park
Will Allen, 6-5, 300, 5.2, Cypress Falls
Roman Reeves, 6-6, 295, 5.2, Livingston
Terrance Young, 6-6, 340, 5.5, Longview
Quarterback (1)
Matt Nordgren, 6-5, 225, 4.6, Dallas B. Lynch
Running Back (2)
Cedric Benson, 5-11, 200, 4.5, Midland Lee
Anthony Johnson, 5-11, 195, 4.4, Jefferson
Defensive End (1)
Eric Hall, 6-2, 240, 4.5, Clarksville, Tenn.
Linebacker (2)
Yamil LeBron, 6-2, 240, 4.7, Killeen Ellison
Lance McFarland, 6-1, 225, 4.6, Jefferson
Defensive Back (5)
Cedric Griffin, 6-1, 180, 4.4, San Antonio Holmes
Aaron Ross, 6-1, 182, 4.42, Tyler
Kendal Briles, 5-10, 175, 4.5, Wolfforth Frenship
Braden Johnson, 6-2, 200, 4.5, Euless Trinity
Brian Carter, 5-11, 180, 4.5, The Woodlands
Punter (1)
Brian Bradford, 6-1, 205, Trinity Valley JC
* * * *
The Longhorns, with 19 commitments already, will give at least three more
and, if things fall right at the end, as many as six additional ones.
There are five players =01) LB Derrick Johnson of Waco, S Dewayne Brandon o=
f
Temple, DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia, Cal., and DE Jonathan Jackson and TE
James Moses, both of Galena Park North Shore =01) who strongly favor Texas.
But all of them are highly recruited national prospects and I would be mild=
ly
surprised if the Horns signed all five of them.
Then there are four great players the Horns are still recruiting very hard =
=01)
DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison, FB James Buchanon of Cardinal Mooney H=
S
in Sarasota, Fla., and OLs William Winston of Houston Madison and Jami
Hightower of Jacksonville.
Texas has a pretty good shot at Harris, but the other three are not leaning
UT's way at this time.
Harris had a great junior year. I saw him play and he was awesome. But he h=
as
a sprained ankle that has hampered his performance this year.
When the ankle was well last summer, he ran a 4.78 40 weighing close to 270
pounds. He's still a super prospect and one the Horns need desperately.

UT Basketball Women Start Practice

The Texas women's basketball team  had its first practice Saturday, and
coach Jody Conradt said she is so pleased with her recruiting class that
three or four of the newcomers will challenge for starting jobs.
The Longhorns are coming off last year's 21-13 season, a second-place finis=

Jakes Becomes Horns' 20th Pledge, More Expected Soon

DL Kaelen Jakes, 6-5, 260, 4.8, of Valencia, California, became Texas' 20th
commitment Thursday morning. He said he called UT assistant coach Tim
Brewster early Thursday and told him he wanted to play for the Longhorns.
Jakes is one of the top defensive line prospects in California. He played
nose guard most of last season, but played end for the final few games. He
had 60 solo tackles and 14 sacks. In the game I saw on tape, he was playing
nose guard and he had seven solo tackles and two sacks while being
consistently double-teamed.
He told me he doesn't care whether he plays defensive end or defensive
tackle. "I just want to play," he said. "I thought all along I probably
would
wind up at Texas and, after looking at everything, I think Texas is the
place
for me."
He said he had scholarship offers from Colorado, Miami, USC, UCLA, Oregon,
Oregon State "and just about everybody else in the Pac 10."
He narrowed it down to Texas and California, cancelling a scheduled trip to
Miami, then got an in-house visit from Washington coach Rick Neuheisel
Tuesday night  from Longhorn head coach Mack Brown  and Brewster Wednesday
morning before picking the Longhorns.
Jakes lived in Plano during his junior high years and said he really
enjoyed
his time in Texas.
"I think Texas is building something special," he said, "and I want to be a
part of it."
James fills an urgent need for Texas. The Longhorns need to sign some
defensive linemen and he and Tommy Harris, the big DT at Killeen Ellison,
are
the only top ones who have been seriously considering Texas. Harris, the
nation's top DT prospect, has been leaning toward OU recently, but he was a
heavy Texas lean earlier, so there is always a chance he will change again
until he signs with someone in February.
* * * *
WR Montrell Jones, 6-2, 185, 4.4, a national top 100 prospect from
Louisville, Ky., Male, says he is seriously considering Texas after backing
off an earlier commitment to Kentuckiy.
The Longhorns don't need a wide receiver this year unless they can sign a
great one. Jones is a great one with good height, great speed and very good
moves to go along with great hands.
The only other out-of-state prospects who have expressed any interest in
Texas lately  are TE Marcus Spears of  Baton Rouge Southern Lab, DT
Marquise
Hill of New Orleans De La Salle and  RB Eric Shelton of Lexington, Ky.,
Bryan
Station. The two Louisiana stars say they probably will visit Texas and
Shelton says he might visit the Longhorns.
* * * *
FOOTBALL NOTES: The Longhorns are 6-point favorites over Oregon for their
Dec. 29 Culligan Holiday Bowl clash in San Diego . . . Look for LB Aurmon
Satchell of Denver Jefferson, who signed with Texas last February, but ran
into some academic problems with the NCAA's National Clearinghouse, to
return
to Texas and enroll next  month for the spring semester. That would enable
him to go through spring practice and it also would keep him from counting
against the 25-man limit for the enrolling scholarship players next fall.
With 20 commitments already, that is very important. . . TE Brock Edwards
and
S Lee Jackson both appear to be recovered from the injuries that knocked
them
out of the last two games last year. They should be ready for the bowl game
unless they suffer a setback when practice resumes next week. . . When
Arizona hired former UT coach John Mackovic, the first thing that came to
my
mind was how Mackovic basically threw in the towel after the 66-3 UCLA loss
in his final 4-7 season coming on the heels of a 10-2 year that had given
the
Horns a top 10 pre-season ranking. Fast forward to this season. Mack
Brown's
Longhorns were a pre-season top 10 team, but OU mauled them, 63-14. Brown
said he was embarrassed to be the Longhorn coach and he really went to work
to bring the team back from that debacle. What he got was six straight
wins,
a bowl game and a team that can crack the top 10 in the final poll for the
first time in 17 years if it wins its bowl game. That's why he's worth the
big bucks and the other quy wasn't.

Part 2 of 3

3 Big Horns Drafted High

All-American OT Leonard Davis was the second player chosen in the NFL draft
Friday and Longhorn All-American teammate DT Casey Hampton also went in the
first round.
Arizona picked Davis after the Atlanta Falcons traded up to get the first
choice and took Virginia Tech QB Michael Vick.
Hampton was chosen by the Pittsburgh Steelers with the 19th pick in the fir=
st
round.
The Horns' other outstanding DT, Shaun Rogers, was picked in the second rou=
nd
by the Detroit Lions. He was the 61st pick overall.
The last time Texas had three players chosen in the first round was in 1982=
.
Texas coach Mack Brown noted that all three players were recruited by forme=
r
coach John Mackovic and his staff, and said he is hoping it starts a trend
that sees several Longhorns being drafted every year.
There might be a little fall off next year, but Longhorns should be very
popular with NFL teams on a regular basis beginning in 2003.
Football Notes, Observations . .
UT QB Chris Simms says he is 100% sure he will stay at Texas for his senior
year.
There had been some speculation that Simms might turn pro after this season=
,
but he said he will stick around for his senior year.
Things to watch for this season that should make a big positive difference
include:
* More weapons to pick up those short-yardage plays to keep drives alive,
like a bigger, stronger running back, a more experienced offensive line and
don't forget great targets in TEs Bo Scaife and Brock Edwards from a two-TE
set.
* More misdirection plays, particularly reverses and quick pitches to the
outside.
* More short passes to frustrate the pass rushers and to give the Horns'
swift and elusive receivers chances to turn short passes into long gains.
Bears Maul Longhorns
The UT baseball players looked great Friday night in whipping Baylor in
Austin, but they looked lost when they went to Waco for the final two games
of their series Saturday and Sunday.
Gerritt Simpson scattered six singles and struck out 10 Friday night to giv=
e
the Horns a 5-1 triumph in the first game of the crucial series.
Ryan Brooks had three hits to pace the offense.
But the Bears got to apply the "mercy rule" twice in Waco, throttling the
Horns 14-4 in seven innings and 16-6 in eight innings.
Texas made seven errors in the two games in Waco and that, coupled with
spotty pitching and very little hitting, turned the two games into routs.
Nebraska (15-4)  is running away with the regular season championship, and
Baylor (14-7) and Texas (16-8) are tied for second place. Texas Tech is
fourth (14-9) and OSU is fifth (12-9).

Offensive Coordinator Interview
Offensive coordinator Greg Davis says there are two areas he always focuses
on in spring practice.
The first is replacing the seniors, and the second  "is schematics, what we
did last season and what changes we need to make, what we should try to do
better."
All-American LT Leonard Davis and All-Big 12 RB Hodges Mitchell were the on=
ly
senior starters on last year's offense, and he said he feels a lot better a=
bo
ut replacing Davis than he does about replacing Mitchell.
"Robbie Doane had a real good spring at left tackle," Davis said. "We also
worked Derrick Dockery some at left tackle because we've got three really
good guards. Alfeo Randall (incoming JC transfer) also is a left tackle.
Considering all the possibilities, I think we'll be okay at left tackle."
"But I don't think we solved anything this spring at tailback," he said. "A=
ll
five guys did some good things, and we could play all five of them, but we
wanted somebody to step up and nobody did."
The five tailbacks are juniors Victor Ike and Kenny Hayter, sophomores Bret=
t
Robin and Ivan Williams and redshirt freshman Sneezy Beltran.
Head coach Mack Brown said Robin had the best spring, but he said none of t=
he
five played at the level the Longhorns need their tailback to reach.
Davis concurred, saying, "We're going into the pre-season practices with an
unsettled situation at tailback."
"Obviously, we're going to find out what the youngster can do when he gets
here," he added.
The youngster, of course, needs no identification. He is Cedric Benson, the
super recruit who is finishing his senior year at Midland Lee after leading
the Rebels to three straight state 5A championships.
As for a changing some things in the overall scheme, Davis said, "We wanted
to add more misdirection this spring and we worked on that. It's an area
where we think we can add some things that will help us."
He said more work needs to be done on the reverses shovel passes and quick
dashes to the outside. "Those things are not greased yet," he said, but I'm
glad we got to throw a lot of those things at them. It gives us some more
avenues to attack."
Davis also said the coaches worked hard this spring on developing a running
game to pick up short-yardage situations.
"We're not going to be a team that says we have to run for a certain amount
of yardage," he said. "We want to do whatever it takes to win the game, but
there are times when you have to be able to run the ball in short yardage,
particularly for first downs, on the goal line and in the fourth quarter wh=
en
we're trying to protect a lead."
Other than the uncertainty at tailback, Davis liked what he saw this spring=
.
"Our linemen had a good spring," he said. "Mike Williams at right tackle ha=
d
a great spring. I think Mike will be an outstanding right tackle this seaso=
n.
"Derrick Dockery had a really good spring at right guard," Davis said, "Mat=
t
Anderson had a good spring at center and Jason Glynn got a lot of snaps
behind Matt. I'm really pleased with Jason Glynn's development."
Davis said the line will be much better when guards Antwan Kirk-Hughes and
Tillman Holloway, who both missed the spring rehabilitating injuries, retur=
n
for pre-season practice.
"Tight end will be a really solid position," he said. "Bo Scaife was able t=
o
get back into things (after knee surgery) and he had a really solid spring.
Brock Edwards is a good young tight end and we'll get Mike Jones (knee
surgery) back for the season."
"Our young wide receivers are just going to get better and better," Davis
said. "Roy Williams, B. J. Johnson and Sloan Thomas all played really well =
as
true freshmen and now they're a year older and more experienced."
He also said walk-on Kyle Shanahan, redshirt freshman Tony Jeffery and seni=
or
Montrell Flowers also will see a lot of action.
Shanahan is the son of the Denver Broncos' head coach and was a starter on =
a
scholarship at Duke before deciding to transfer and walk on at Texas becaus=
e
he wants to be a coach and felt this was the best place to learn the trade.
After sitting out last season, Shanahan is a junior and he catches the ball
as well as anybody on the team.
"This is a really solid group, with very good players and quality depth,"
Davis said. "We're really pleased with our wide receivers."
"At quarterback," he said, "you would be hard pressed to find anybody who h=
as
two like we do."
They are junior starter Chris Simms and senior Major Applewhite, who
shattered most of Texas' passing records before severe injuries to both kne=
es
sidelined him gave Simms a chance to win the job.
Davis also said he is very pleased with the development of redshirt freshma=
n
QB Chance Mock.
"Chance Mock is really talented," Davis said. "He has really good skills."
Mock has outstanding speed for a quarterback and a strong arm. He also has =
a
very quick release.
"He needs to get some experience, but he has all the tools," Davis said.
So, looking at everything, how good can this Longhorn offense be?
"I think this group has a chance to be really good," he said. "We have a lo=
t
of talented players. We just need to solidify the running game, and we're
working on that."

UT Hires Volleyball Coach

Jerritt Elliott, 32, former interim head women's volleyball coach at the
University of Southern California, is the new head women's volleyball coach
at Texas.
He was the interim coach at USC for two years while former UT and current U=
SC
coach Mick Haley was coaching the U. S. Olympic Team.
Elliott replaces Jim Moore, who resigned.
A highly personable coach who is an outstanding recruiter, Elliott had the
top-rated recruiting classes in the nation both years he was at USC.
Last season, he led USC to its first final four appearance in 15 years and =
to
USC's first-ever share of the Pac-10 title.
USC also finished the year ranked No. 4 nationally by both the AVCA and
Volleyball Magazine.
USC compiled a 50-12 record under Elliott in these two years, going 29-3 la=
st
fall en route to the NCAA Final Four, and 21-9 in 1999.
In both years, Elliott was honored as the Pac-10 Conference Coach of the Ye=
ar
and was the 2000 Pacific Region Coach of the Year.
Elliott spent the last six years at USC (1995-2001), the last two years as
interim head coach and a four-year term prior to that as assistant coach.
Elliott accepted the interim head position in 1999 and 2000 in the absence =
of
Haley, who was serving as the USA National Team head coach through the  200=
0
Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
Elliott also was named the USA Junior National Team Head Coach for the summ=
er
of 2001, but will relinquish that role with USA Volleyball due to his
appointment at UT.
"It is with tremendous pleasure that I accept the University of Texas
volleyball  head coach position," he said. "I am extremely enthusiastic abo=
ut
coming to Texas, which is considered one of the prominent volleyball progra=
ms
in the country."

Galena Park OL Switches from Aggies to Longhorns

Galena Park OL Mike Garcia, 6-3, 280, 5.2, who had committed to Texas A&M
several weeks ago, switched his pledge to Texas Monday and his coach, Mike
Coker, said the switch is final. "It's a done deal," Coker said.
Coker said Garcia and his mother visited the Texas campus last week on an
unofficial visit and met with some of the Texas coaches.
"He's a little embarrassed about the whole situation," Coker said, "but he
said he felt it was something he had to do."  Coker said he discussed the
situation with coaches at Texas and A&M before announcing Garcia's change
of
heart. Garcia was the highest rated of the Aggies' three early commitments.
Coker said Garcia "felt very comfortable with Mack Brown, his staff and the
atmosphere at the University of Texas."
Garcia  is the seventh high school player to commit to Texas this month. In
addition, Alfio Randall, a star OT at Blinn JC, says he will come to Texas
in
January after he graduates from Blinn.
The other high school players who have committed to Texas are OLs Jonathan
Scott of Dallas Carter, Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village, Roman
Reeves
of Livingston and Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls and DBs Braden
Johnson
of Euless Trinity and Brian Carter of The Woodlands.
Scott and Robinson are on all of the early national top 100 recruiting
lists.
With six top offensive linemen already committed, counting Randall, the
Longhorns are on the way to signing an awesome group  to fill their
greatest
need in this recruiting class. Top offensive and defensive linemen have
been
in short supply in Texas since Brown arrived, but this year's offensive
line
class is very deep in talented players.
The Longhorns  are still in strong contention for two other top offensive
linemen

-  Jami Hightower of Jacksonville and William Winston of Houston
Madison. Hightower drove to Nebraska for an unofficial weekend visit and,
after the 14-hour return trip, said today he had a great time and said
Nebraska, Texas and A&M are his big three. Winston also likes A&M and
Texas,
but is considering several out-of-state schools.
* * * *
BARNUM UPDATE: Greg Barnum, the great center prospect who left Tennessee
after his freshman year, took a tour of the Texas campus last week and he
liked what he saw.  Vol coach Phil Fulmer has refused to give Barnum a
release so far, which would force him to pay his own way for a year if he
comes to Texas as things now stand. But Barnum's attorney has written a
letter to Tennessee officials demanding a release. NCAA rules require
colleges and their recruits to honor the letter of intent recruits sign for
one year. But the rules give the college coach a big advantage after the
first year in that he can refuse to renew the scholarship or, as in
Barnum's
case, refuse to allow the kid to get an immediate scholarship at another
school. The NCAA has some rules that probably violate the U. S.
Constitution,
and this would seem to be one of them. Back when colleges gave kids
four-year
scholarships, it might have been fair to give coaches the right to deny an
outright release to unhappy recruits, but when the rules were changed to
give
one-year scholarships that were renewable every year, the coach's power was
left unchanged. I don't think the NCAA or Tennessee will want to see this
come to court, so, if I was a gambling man, I would be willing to bet a
fair
amount that young Mr. Barnum gets his release if he keeps pushing. If he
comes to Texas, he will have to sit out a year, then will have three years
of
eligibility left.
* * * *
BASEBALL NOTES: The pros are still working to sign several current
Longhorns
and UT recruits, but  only three juniors
- second baseman Tommy Nicholson,
relief ace Charlie Thames and shortstop Todd West
- have signed so far.

BASKETBALL RECRUITING NOTES: Guard Carlos Hurt of Alief Elsik has committed
to Louisville. The Longhorns were recruiting him, but their primary target
for their lone remaining scholarship is still 5-11 T. J. Ford,  who led
Fort
Bend Willowridge win the Class 5A state title.  Ford, one of the nation's
top
point guards, is strongly considering the Longhorns. Texas already has a
commitment from 6-10 center Chris Wright of Redwater.

Mitchell, Stockton, Defense Lead Longhorns
Past Raiders; Applewhite Hurts Other Knee

It was a game of surges, weather wise and on the football field, Saturday
night in Lubbock and Texas triumphed, 29-17, because the Longhorns had two
surges and Texas Tech had only one.
The Longhorns dominated the first quarter  an d most of the second in cold,
rainy, sold-out Jones Stadium, coming out smoking offensively for the first
time all season.
Midway through the second quarter, Texas was ahead, 16-0, and seemingly on
the way to an easy win. But Texas Tech scored 10 points before intermission=
,
then scored again early in the second half to take a 17-16 lead.
Despite losing QB Major Applewhite to a knee injury (the right one, not the
surgically repaired left one), the Longhorns roared back to score the game'=
s
final 13 points to claim the victory and stay alive in the Big 12 title cha=
se.
Coach Mack Brown said an MRI was done on Applewhite's knee Sunday and he
hopes to know the results sometime Monday. He said he is hoping it is just =
a
sprain.
The Longhorn heroes were plentiful. Offensively, the entire line played
great, TB Hodges Mitchell was tremendous and Kris Stockton booted five fiel=
d
goals and narrowly missed on a 55-yard attempt late in the first half.
Mitchell had 45 carries for 229 yards and scored both Longhorn touchdowns. =
He
also caught six passes for 38 yards.
Defensively, the Horns forced five turnovers, which the offense converted
into 20 points, and shut the Raider offense out for the final 25 minutes.
The victory gave Texas a 7-2 season record and 5-1 Big 12 mark, while Tech
fell to 6-4 overall and  2-4 in the Big 12.
If Texas A&M upsets Oklahoma this weekend, the Longhorns can tie the Sooner=
s
for the Big 12 South title by beating Kansas and A&M to close the regular
season.
By virtue of their win over the Horns, the Sooners would represent the Sout=
h
in the title game, but the tie and a 9-2 record would land the Longhorns in=
 a
top bowl game.
The Longhorns have won four games in a row after a slow start this season.
Here, briefly, is how the game went:
FIRST QUARTER
The Longhorns moved the ball all over the field in the first quarter and to=
ok
a 10-0 lead. They got the ball first and drove 69 yards to the Tech 5, with
Mitchell getting all of the yardage on six tough runs behind good blocking
and a 1-yard pass reception. But the drive stalled and Stockton kicked a
23-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead with 11:08 left. Tech went three plays an=
d
out, and Mitchell led another Longhorn drive that went 62 yards for a
touchdown and a 10-0 lead with 6:18 left. He carried four times for 35 yard=
s,
including a 5-yard burst over right tackle for the TD. Applewhite also hit
freshman TE Brock Edwards for 18 yards during the drive. With the aid of tw=
o
penalties against UT, the Raiders drove to the Texas' 11, and QB Kliff
Kingsbury hit WR Tim Baker at the 5, but Baker fumbled and the Horns
recovered and were on the move again when the quarter ended.
SECOND QUARTER
The  drive that started at the Texas 5 stalled at the TT 30, but Stockton's
47-yard field goal gave UT a 13-0 leadwith 12:54 left. UT safety Greg Brown=
's
interception of a long Kingsbury pass killed Tech's next effort, but Texas
couldn't move and punted for the first time. Kingsbury, operating out of th=
e
shotgun, bobbled a low snap and UT CB Ahmad Brooks fell on the loose ball a=
t
the Raiders' 16. The Horns picked up a first down at the 4, but Mitchell wa=
s
stopped for no gain and two passes were incomplete, so Stockton kicked a
22-yard field goal for a 16-0 lead with 9:06 left. But the Raiders came rig=
ht
back and Kingsbury hit WR Carlos Francis for a 39-yard touchdown strike tha=
t
cut the UT lead to 16-7 with 7:34 remaining. Texas had to punt   and Tech,
aided by a pass interference penalty, drove to the UT 11 before settling fo=
r
a 28-yard field goal to cut the deficit to 16-10 with 5:34 left. Applewhite
was sacked and fumbled on UT's next possession, giving the Raiders great
field position at the Texas 33. But the Longhorn defense held and a 49-yard
field goal try fell short. UT drove to the Tech 38, but Stockton's 55-yard
field goal try  just missed to the left in the final 30 seconds of the half=
.
THIRD QUARTER
Tech got the ball to start the half, but couldn't mount a drive. But
Applewhite's  pass was picked off by Tech DB John Norman, who ran it back t=
o
the UT 14. Kingsbury got 13 yards on a QB draw, which was the longest Raide=
r
run of the game, and Ricky Williams went over the top for the final yard. T=
he
extra point put Tech on top, 17-16, with 10:35 left. But that lead was shor=
t
lived. Starting from their 25, the Longhorns drove to the Tech 18 before
Applewhite was sacked on a third-down play. He came up limping and never
returned to the game. Stockton booted a 36-yard field goal to put Texas bac=
k
on top, 19-17, with 6:07 left. The Raiders went three plays and out and so
did the Longhorns, but Stockton's punt was fumbled at the Tech 18 and Micha=
el
Ungar recovered for the Horns. Behind great blocking, Mitchell ran for 8,
then for the final 10 and the TD that gave Texas a little breathing room at
26-17, with 2:07 left. The Raiders were driving as the quarter ended.
FOURTH QUARTER
DE Cole Pittman sacked Kingsbury on the first play of the quarter and CB
Roderick Babers intercepted Kingsbury's pass two plays later and ran it bac=
k
23 yards to the Tech 45. Mitchell carried fiv e times fror 25 yards and
Simms, under a big rush, found Johnson for 9 yards. But a penalty set the
Horns back and Stockton came in to boot his fifth field goal, a 32-yarder, =
to
put the Horns on top, 29-17, with 9:54 left. The Raiders killed most of the
clock with a long drive that came up empty. They drove from their own 20 to
the UT 33 so slowly and laboriously that the clock ran from 9:54 to 4:01 by
the time their fourth-down pass sailed incomplete. The drive would have end=
ed
much earlier, but for two strange penalties against the Horns. One was a la=
te
offside call after UT recovered a fumble and the other was a personal foul =
on
UT DE Cory Redding after he sacked Kingsbury. The officials said the foul w=
as
a blow to the head, but Redding didn't appear to hit him in the head. At an=
y
rate, after the fourth-down play failed, Mitchell carried six straight time=
s
for 28 yards and two first downs to run out the rest of the clock.

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday QB Major Applewhite's knee injury Saturday nig=
ht
does not appear to be as serious as the one he suffered in the Cotton Bowl
game against Arkansas.
The injury to Applewhite's left knee in the Cotton Bowl required surgery to
repair a torn ACL (anterier cruciate ligament.
Brown said the injury to his right knee Saturday in Lubbock might be just a
sprain. "I'm not a doctor, so I don't know," he said. "We're having an MRI
done today, and we'll know more tomorrow."
But Applewhite had to be taken off the field on a stretcher in the Cotton
Bowl and he was standing on the sideline with Brown at the end of the Texas
Tech game.
"We were standing on the sideline at the end of the game," Brown said. "He
walked off the field with me. He was upbeat and excited about the game. It
sure didn't look like what happened to him in the Arkansas game."
He said Chris Simms played well in relief and he said the fact that Simms
played as much as he did early this season is a big plus if Applewhite's
injury turns out to be serious.
"Chris progresses every time he walks out on the field," Brown said. "He pu=
t
a tremendous amount of pressure on himself early in the season. I felt like
last night was the most comfortable he has been."
"There is no doubt in our minds that Chris is more ready to play now than h=
e
was at the first of the season," Brown said.
Simms threw only two passes and he completed both of them. As he said, "my
main job was pitching to Hodges left and pitching to Hodges right."
With Hodges Mitchell rushing for 229 yards and 45 carries (both career high=
s)
and the line opening huge holes, that was the Longhorn offense for most of
the night.
Brown also said he probably wouldn't take the redshirt off freshman QB Chan=
ce
Mock if Applewhite's injury is serious. "We'll talk about that. I'd think
right now we'd play Beau Trahan."
Brown said freshman TE Brock Edwards "played really well," and he said DT
Casey Hampton, DEs Cory Redding and Kalen Thornton, LB De'Andre Lewis and D=
Bs
Quentin Jammer, Rod Babers and Greg Brown played well, too. He said LB Tyro=
ne
Jones "had by far his best game."
He also said the offensive line "played great and Hodges did a great job of
picking his holes. We've shown the ability in the last four games to throw =
it
or run it. We couldn't do that earlier in the year."
Brown said the five Tech turnovers were a great credit to the UT defense, a=
nd
he said, "I'm really proud of the offense to, with four minutes left, take =
it
and drive it on the ground and run out the clock. I've alway said you need =
to
be able to run the ball in the fourth quarter to win."

Owens, Thomas Lead Horns

Junior 6-9 forward Chris Owens had 27 points and 14 rebounds and 6-8 freshm=
an
forward James Thomas had 25 points and nine rebounds to lead the Longhorn
basketball team to a 92-81 exhibition victory over Team Ezybonds of Austral=
ia
before 2,305 fans at the Frank Erwin Center Sunday night.
"I think, for the most part, we played hard tonight," Texas coach Rick Barn=
es
said.  "I think our guys realize that with being such a young team, you hav=
e
to go through some growing pains.  Our defense was not good tonight.  We go=
t
hurt in transition defense and by dribble penetration, so we'll obviously
have to work on those things."
Owens scored his 27 points on 11-of-22 shooting in just 28 minutes of work,
while Thomas went 10-of-16 from the floor. Junior swingman Maurice Evans
added 13 points on 5-of-13 shooting, while junior point guard Fredie Willia=
ms
had five points, seven assists andseven steals.
Texas concludes its exhibition season with a home game against EA Sports
California All-Stars Wednesday at 7 p.m. at the Erwin Center.
The Longhorns open the 2000-01 regular season when they host Navy on Monday=
,
Nov 13 in the opening round of the Preseason NIT at 7 p.m. at the Erwin
Center.

Dillard, Freshmen Sparkle

Sophomore guard Tai Dillard led six Longhorn players in double figures with=
 a
team-high 16 points, plus seven assists and eight steals to pace the Texas
women's basketball team to a 91-56 victory over Spartak-Moscow in exhibitio=
n
game action at the Center Thursday night.
Texas never trailed in the contest, jumping out to a 12-0 lead in the first
2:56 of the game.  UT was aided  by seven Spartak-Moscow turnovers in that
span.
Spartak-Moscow, which opened a two-week exhibition swing through the states
of Texas and Louisiana against the Longhorns, committed 36 turnovers, 19 of
which came in the first half. Texas had 22 steals in the game, while
Spartak-Moscow had 13.
Joining Dillard in double-figure scoring were sophomore guard Alisha Sare,
who had 13 points and hit three 3-pointers, and freshman forward Annissa
Hastings and junior forward Tracy Cook, who each added 12 points. Senior
guard JoRuth Woods finished with 11 points, while freshman forward Stacy
Stephens scored 10 points..
"We'll need to spend some time looking at the videotape of this game, becau=
se
everything that could happen in a basketball game happened here tonight,"
said Texas head coach Jody Conradt. "I think we started strong, pushing the
ball up the floor which was good, but then the game was too easy at the
start, and we got into a lull."

Injury Update

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday reserve CB Ervis Hill suffered a separated
shoulder and will miss the Kansas game, but he said OG Antwan Kirk-Hughes
played most of the Texas Tech game without having any shoulder problems.
Kirk-Hughes' shoulder had been popping out, but Brown said he was encourage=
d
that he went through an entire game without problems.
He also said DT Shaun Rogers played without reinjuring his ankle.
Redshirt freshman DT Ryan Haywood underwent shoulder surgery Wednesday and =
is
out for the remainder of the season.
Brown said Haywood had a high school shoulder injury that flared up again
this year.
He said the surgery should eliminate the problem, and he said Haywood might
be available for part or possibly all of spring practice.

Roy Williams Leads Outstanding Freshman Class in Workouts
The heralded Longhorn freshman class had its first two workouts Monday, and
several players looked very good, but big, fast WR Roy Williams was almost
too impressive to believe.
He's big, at about 6-3 or maybe 6-4 and a little over 200 pounds (we should
get official heights and weights Tuesday) and he is fast (10.03 100 meters
last track season) and no one could cover him Monday. He caught so many
long
passes I lost count.
Pitty poor Nathan Vasher, the lone scholarship DB among the freshmen. He
had
to try to cover Williams, B. J. Johnson, Sloan Thomas and Tony Jeffery, the
best group of freshman wide receivers in the country. As soon as he got
through with one and got a little breather, it was on to the next one.
Vasher
actually did a good job most of the time on everybody except Williams, who
was just too big and too strong for him to handle. Vasher does a good job
of
man coverage, getting right with the wide receiver and staying with him on
most occasions.
Also pity poor QB Chance Mock, who probably threw more passes Monday than
he
did in his whole career at The Woodlands. He showed great accuracy and
touch
on long and short passes, and offensive coordinator Greg Davis,
complimented
him for having "a quick release." But I'll bet his arm is sore Tuesday.
Coach Mack Brown said he doesn't normally want to play freshmen,
particularly
early in the season, but he said it is easier for wide receivers to play
early than for most other players.
"Take our two freshmen defensive ends, Kalen Thornon and Adam Doiron,"
Brown
said. "They are very good prospects, but they have never lined up against
anybody like Leonard Davis, and that's what they'll start doing when the
veterans show up. Their learning curve goes up pretty drastically, and they
probably will need some time to cope with that."
But he said it's a different story with wide receivers. "If a receiver can
run, jump, catch and do something after he catches it, Brown said, "we can
make the offense simpler for him,"
Darryl Drake, the wide receiver coach, phrased it another way, saying, "If
a
guy is 6-3 or 6-4, can run close to a 10-flat hundred meters and high jump
seven feet (Williams did all that last year at Odessa Permian), we'll just
tell him to run down the field and, if anybody can keep up with him,
they're
probably short cornerbacks and he can outjump them for the ball. We'll
coach
him next year, but he can get by with the speed and jumping ability this
year." Drake was only partially kidding.
When Williams has to try to get off the line against big-time correrbacks
like Quentin Jammer and Roderick Babers, the two UT starters, it will be
harder, but Brown said all the receivers are going to get a lot of work
against bump-and-run coverage. He also said he expects at least two of them
to play a lot early in the season;
Thomas, Johnson and Jeffery also had some good plays. Thomas made one great
catch of a high ball that appeared to be out of his reach.
One UT assistant coach told me today he has never seen back-to-back classes
as outstanding as the two the Longhorns have put together the last two
years.
The freshmen will have their final workouts as a group Tuesday. The varsity
reports Wednesday and the first full team workouts will be Friday.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: The news got as little better today on the state's best
quarterback, Matt Nordgren, 6-5, 217, 4.62, of Dallas Bishop Lynch. He
visited Colorado unofficially last weekend and came back very impressed and
saying he wants to delay his decision on picking a college.
But he told me today the Longhorn coaches are recruiting two quarterbacks
(Bret Rawls of Louisiana powerhouse Shreveport Evangel is the other one)
"and
they gave us both a deadline of October 15 and told us to look around and
be
sure what we want to do. I think that is a real sign of class," he said.
"I'll probably take some official visits before that, maybe to Colorado,
Kansas, LSU and Tennessee, and then I'll take an official visit to Texas. I
still say Texas will be hard to beat, but I just want to be real sure
before
I make a decision."

Longhorns Get Huge Longview Offensive Lineman as 12th Commitment
Terrance Young, 6-6, 340, 5.5, of Longview, another star in the outstanding
class of offensive line recruits in the state this year, came to Texas
Saturday with his parents and committed to the Longhorns. He is Texas' 12th
commitment, and that group includes seven offensive linemen.
Young , who already is a full qualifier with a 980 SAT and 21 ACT score,
said
he also had scholarship offers from Miami, UCLA, Notre Dame, Arkansas,
Texas
A&M, LSU, Mississippi State and several other schools. But he said he has
been a Texas fan for some time and decided to commit when he was offered a
scholarship by Coach Mack Brown Saturday.
He said he met with Brown and assistant coaches Darryl Drake and Tim Nunez.
Drake recruits the Longview area and Nunez is the offensive line coach.
When asked what he feels his strong points are as an offensive lineman,
Young
said he has worked hard to get quicker and feels he has a quick initial
charge. He said the Texas coaches told him they like the way he makes quick
contact and holds his blocks.
"I really like Texas," he said. "They have great coaches and great kids and
they are going to do some great things in the next few years and I want to
be
part of it."
Longview coach Pat Collins, who coached an NCAA Division II national title
team at Northeast Louisiana a few years ago, has seen some top football
players and he says Young "is one of the best high school prospects I have
seen or coached. He has worked really hard this summer and has excellent
mobility and agility. He's a great prospect and a great kid who has really
supportive parents."
For those of you who are disturbed by Young's 40 time, don't worry about
it.
He has a very quick start for such a big man and was adept at picking off
speed rushers from his offensive tackle spot as a junior. Collins told me
he
is moving Young to guard "because he is a really physical blocker and I
want
to us to be able to run inside better. He can help the team more at guard,
but he could play guard or tackle in college."
The state's top QB prospect, Matt Nordgren, 6-5, 217, 4.62, of Dallas
Bishop
Lynch, was scheduled to go to Texas A&M this weekend for an unofficial
visit
with his coach, Gary Oliver, a former Aggie receiver.
But I talked to Nordgren today (Sunday) and he told he didn't get to go to
A&M because Oliver wasn't able to go. He said he planned to take a quick
trip
to Colorado, "but I didn't go to either place. I don't think I'm going to
be
able to go to Colorado now, because coach Oliver and I probably will go to
A&M next weekend and then we'll be starting two-a-days."
Asked if he is getting close to a decision, Nordgren said, "I really like
Texas and I don't think that is going to change. I don't think anyone is
going to beat Texas."
I will be very surprised if he doesn't commit to Texas immediately after
returning from his A&M visit.
Texas' 12 early commitments  include seven offensive linemen. In addition
to
Young, the OLs are Mike Garcia of Galena Park (who switched from A&M to
Texas), Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter, Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey
Village, Roman Reeves of Livingston, Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls
and
Alfio Randall of Blinn JC.
Scott and Robinson are national top 100 players and Randall was a top 100
player at Houston Yates two years ago. The other pledges are QB/DB Kendal
Briles of Frenship, MLB Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison, and DBs Cedric
Griffin of San Antonio Holmes, Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity and Brian
Carter of The Woodlands.
* * * **
RECRUITING NOTES: Incoming UT QB Chance Mock of The Woodlands is impressing
everyone at the workouts for the North-South High School All-Star Game. It
will be at Rice Stadium Tuesday night and Mock has been looking great
rolling
out and throwing on the run. I have seen him throw the ball about 80 yards,
and he threw it with some zip, too, so there is no question about his arm
strength. Athlete Tony Jeffery of Klein Forest has already been impressing
the UT defensive backs in voluntary summer workouts and he also is looking
great at WR and DB in the North-South workouts.

I'm sorry that you didn't sleep well.  I hope it wasn't because I called
you last night-although I'm sure that it didn't help.  It rained really
hard here too, but I was so tired that it didn't wake me up much.

It'll be nice to see you on Saturday.  I probably will party on Friday
too!  I can't wait!

3 and a half more days.....

Love you,
Jenn

The newsletter and e-mail/fax service for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful

Volume 11, No. 18, June 18, 2001

 Most Football Forecasters Rank Longhorns
High Nationally, See OU Game as Key to Season

Most of the good national football magazines are out and so is the one that
serves as an every-year staple for fans in Texas - Dave Campbell's Texas
Football - and all of them agree on two things:
1. The Longhorns are going to be very good this 2001 season, with coach Mack
Brown's most talented team at Texas poised to claim its place among the
nation's elite once again.
2. Defending national champion Oklahoma is going to be very good, too, so
mark October 6 on your calendar and plan to be in Dallas on that date for the
clash of Big 12 South titans.
With apologies to the other Big 12 South teams, I think the Longhorns and the
Sooners will be so far above their division rivals that the winner of that
October 6 Dallas showdown will win the Southern Division and have a chance
for national honors.
The Longhorns have other dangerous games, and so do the Sooners, but it's
hard to see either of them stumbling more than once when they aren't playing
each other, so look for the Cotton Bowl winner to emerge as a big player on
the national scene.
Of course, as Longhorn fans know exceeedingly well, to their chagrin, bad
things happen quite often through the course of a season.
Remember Stanford last year and North Carolina State the year before? Of
course you do. We all do. They are sad memories for all Longhorns.
But Brown's teams have also won great victories - over Nebraska twice in
three tries, Oklahoma twice in three years and A&M twice in three seasons,
plus a decisive Cotton Bowl victory over Mississippi State and Jackie
Sherrill.
Brown's first team at Texas went 9-3 after a 1-2 start and Ricky Williams won
the Heisman Trophy. Coming on the heels of a 4-7 team that ended the John
Mackovic era, it was an impressive start  for the Brown era.
His second team at Texas was rolling along at 9-2 when its wide receivers
started getting nicked and then the best one (Kwame Cavil) got suspended. It
lost its final three games to wind up 9-5, but it was a very good team until
those last three  games.
When you only have three good wide receivers and two of them get hurt and the
third one misses the bowl game, it's tough to operate successfully when you
are primarily a passing team.
Some fans were disappointed in that 1999 team, and it is understandably
disheartening to lose three games to close the season, but those 1999
Longhorns did some very good things like handing Nebraska its only loss,
rallying from a 17-0 deficit to beat Bob Stoops' first Oklahoma team and
hammering Stanford, 69-17. That Stanford team went on to win the Pac 10 and
earn a Rose Bowl berth.
Brown's third team at Texas was last year's unit, which finished 9-3.
Frankly, when I saw superb young TE Bo Scaife go down with a season-ending
knee injury during two-a-days, I would have settled for 7-4.
The Longhorns had only three scholarship tight ends and the other two also
suffered injuries that ended their seasons.
And that wasn't all. DT Shaun Rogers missed some games and was never at full
speed after an early season injury. Ditto for both starting guards - Antwan
Kirk-Hughes and Derrick Dockery.
Then there was the so-called quarterback controversy. It really wasn't that
much of a controversy because Major Applewhite simply didn't look like the
same great quarterback after his knee injury and Chris Simms simply didn't
have enough experience to play well early in the year.
I think the coaches were just trying to find one quarterback who could play
at a winning level, not playing some game with their quarterbacks.
Neither quarterback played as well last season as the pre-injury Applewhite,
but Simms did improve as the season progressed and he is the unquestioned No.
1 guy heading into this season.
There were two reasons for this brief review of Mack Brown's three seasons at
Texas.
The first was to say three nine-win seasons in a row with the kind of
problems that hit the team in 1999 and 2000 are pretty remarkable and all
Longhorn fans should be thanking their lucky stars every day that the leaders
of a school that would hire John Mackovic would get smart enough to hire Mack
Brown the next time around.
The second was to say that injuries, while always a point of concern,
shouldn't be quite as worrisome this season because the superb recruiting
classes Brown and his staff have signed will be three deep this season. He
actually will have four classes on campus, but he got a late start his first
year and his first class was good, but not great. The last three have been
great.
There are some questions to be answered, particularly at running back, but
there are talented players at virtually every position, and that is something
now many college teams can say.
The receiving corps, including the wide receivers and tight ends, will be the
best in the Big 12 and maybe in the country and the secondary might be the
best in the Big 12, too, although Oklahoma fans and coaches would dispute
that.
If Simms is the best passer in the league, as all the football magazines
attest, and if Cedric Benson is as good as we all think, look out everyone
because the Longhorns will be for real.
Don't worry about all that talk about our defensive tackles. The Big 12 is a
passing league and these tackles are quick to the passer.
But you should worry some about the place kicking. Unless one of the
returnees gets better or one of the walk-ons steps up, the same thing that
knocked Bobby Bowden out of a couple of national titles at Florida State
could jump up and bite the Longhorns.

Benson Will Mix Football, Baseball; Cosby Drops Football

Two super Longhorn recruits have signed pro baseball contracts, but only one
of them - and it is not Cedric Benson - is giving up college football to
concentrate on professional football.
Benson, who led Midland Lee to three straight Class 5A state titles,  signed
with the Los Angeles Dodgers, but he signed a contract like the one Ricky
Williams signed out of high school.
It lets him play college football and use pro baseball as a highly paid
summer job.
"I want to play college football at Texas," Benson said. "Someday I want to
play both sports professionally, but I want to play college football first."
But Mart's Quan Cosby, a nationally recruited athlete who was ticketed to
play wide receiver at Texas, signed a five-year baseball contract with the
California Angels and said his football playing days are over.
It came as a shock to the Longhorn coaches and to me and most other
Longhorns. You just don't expect a sixth-round draft choice to get enough
money to give up football.
But Cosby told me he got close to first-round money. "I told them what it
would take for me to give up football, and that's what they came up with," he
said, but he declined to give a hint about his signing bonus.
Cosby said baseball is "easier on the body, so I probably will be able to
play baseball longer than I could have played football."
Asked if he might return to Texas to play football if his baseball career
doesn't work out as planned, he said, "That's a possibility, but I'm figuring
on playing baseball for a long time."

Scaife Injures Knee, Out for Season; Roy Williams Tears Up Varsity DBs

Sophomore TE Bo Scaife, the guy I figured the offense could least afford to
lose because of his blitz-breaking capabilities, tore the ACL in his left
knee during the Longhorns' first varsity workout Friday morning and he will
be out for the season.
Scaife, a sure-handed tight end with great speed, had surgery on his right
knee as a senior in high school. He was slowed by that injury last season,
but regained his speed by the spring and was sensational in spring drills.
Coach Mack Brown said Scaife will undergo surgery and will miss the entire
season. The only good news is that he can use this season as a redshirt
season, since he did play some last season. That means he will have three
years of eligibility remaining, beginning in 2001.
"Now, he will have had them both fixed, they'll be stronger and maybe he
can
have three good years," Brown said.
Brown said Mike Jones, the starter last season at tight end, is a
sure-handed
receiver and outstanding blockers, but he said the Horns will miss Scaife's
speed. He said freshman Brock Edwards, who also has speed, but not as much
as
Scaife, will get a lot of work, starting Saturday, to see if he can help
take
up some of the slack left by Scaife's injury. He also said walk-on TE
Cullen
Loeffler has shown some good things and also will get a chance to see if he
can contribute.
This was a major blow to the Texas offense, but there is some good news.
The
Longhorns probably have their best secondary since 1991, but freshman WR
Roy
Williams, 6-3, 208, long-armed and fast, fast, fast, treated the starting
cornerbacks and safeties like cannon fodder in the morning workout,
catching
two long touchdown passes and tight-roping the sideline for two other big
catches. He dropped only one pass all day, and it was when he ran over an
obstacle. The team worked primarily on putting in some running plays in the
afternoon workout, so the DBs were spared another dose of Williams in the
afternoon.
All of the heralded freshmen WRs are looking good, but Williams is looking
sensational. I can see why some veteran West Texas football watchers say he
is the greatest prospect ever to come out of Odessa Permian. There just
aren't a lot of people his size who can run 100 meters in 10.03, high jump
seven feet and broad jump a state record 26-5.
Even defensive coordinator Carl Reese was impressed by Williams. "I tell
you
what, he didn't look like a freshman to me," Reese said. "He looked pretty
good out there."
Sloan Thomas, B. J. Johnson and Tony Jeffery are the other three freshmen
WRs, and they all had their moments Friday. Thomas made some acrobatic
catches on balls that appeared to be overthrown, Johnson and Jeffery, a
high
school QB star who is making the switch to WR, both used their quickness to
get off the line of scrimmage and make some impressive grabs.
The Longhorns are loaded at QB, with All-Big 12 Major Applewhite battling
budding star Chris Simms for the starting job. Both looked very sharp
throwing
long and short Friday, but freshman CB Nathan Vasher and backup linebacker
O. J. McClintock picked off two of Simms' passes and both might have scored
if it had been in a game-type scrimmage.
Applewhite, who underwent off-season knee surgery, appeared to be back to
normal. He showed as much mobility as he has ever had in rolling right or
left, and his passes were on target. Simms also had a good day, except for
the two interceptions.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES:  Don't be surprised if the official visit for DE Eric
Hall
of Clarksville, Tenn., is moved from the scheduled Sept. 9 date. Hall has a
game Friday night, Sept. 8, and UT's game on Saturday, Sept. 9, starts at
11:30 a.m. UT can have a jet plane waiting for Hall after his game and it
can
fly him to Austin, but his parents want to come on his visit to Austin,
too.
But NCAA rues don't allow schools to transport parents. So, the parents
would
have to fly commercially, which means they would either have to leave
before
his high school game that Friday, or come in Saturday, in which case they
would be too late for the Texas' season opener against Louisiana-
Lafayette.
. . The early emphasis in Texas recruiting has been on offensive linemen.
Look for the late emphasis to be on signing five or six defensive linemen,
including some big ends who might grow into tackles.

No TV for Buffs; Brown Says Horns Need Best Game to Win Saturday

The Texas-Colorado game in Boulder on October 14 has been set for 2:30 p.m.
Austin time, and 1:30 Colorado time and it will not be televised. There is
no
possibility of a pay-per-view live telecast because that would  conflict
with
the ABC Big 12 telecast and the Big 12's contract with ABC does not allow
such conflicts.
Incredibly, one of the games that was chosen over Texas-Colorado was Texas
A&M-Baylor.
* * * *
Coach Mack Brown said Monday the Longhorns "have to play better than we've
played so far this year to have a chance to win" Saturday's big game with
unbeaten Oklahoma.
"Josh Heupel is as good a quarterback as there is in the country," Brown
said. "They are running the ball much better this year, and they have a lot
of talent on both sides of the ball."
Heupel lit up the Texas defense for 17 points in the first quarter last
year,
but the Longhorns came back for a 38-28 victory. "I went to get a drink of
water and when I got back we were down by 17 last year," Brown quipped.
Brown said SS Lee Jackson should be able to play Saturday, but he said DT
Shaun Rogers is still questionable because of the sprained ankle he
sustained
in the victory over Houston. The Horns will return to practice Tuesday and
Brown said he'll know a lot more about the chances of Rogers being able to
play after he sees what he can do Tuesday.
Brown said Hodges Mitchell will continue to start at tailback, but he  said
sophomore Kenny Hayter played well in gaining 122 yards against Oklahoma
State and will get a lot of playing time.
Hayter is a 215-pound power runner and Brown said "big backs wear the other
team down." Hayter made most of his yards against OSU in the second half,
and
Brown said he hopes the Horns will be able to run with some success
Saturday.
He didn't say who would start at quarterback, but he did say Major
Applewhite
is "looking more like the old Major every week." Applewhite underwent knee
surgery in January and Brown said Applewhite seems to be gaining more
confidence in the knee. "He made some plays off-schedule Saturday," Brown
said, adding that he will need to make some more off-schedule plays
Saturday
to give the Longhorns a chance to win.
Brown said Applewhite's quick recovery has been a surprise. "I wasn't even
sure he would be able to play until mid-season," he said.
He also said the Longhorns are much deeper in the secondary than they have
been, and he said that will help a lot against Oklahoma because of the
Sooners' league-leading passing attack. He said cornerbacks Quentin Jammer
and Roderick Babers "have really improved our secondary." He also noted
that
defensive coordinator Carl Reese can use Ahmad Brooks and Ervis Hill, last
year's starting cornerbacks, in his nickel and dime packages on obvious
passing downs. Of course, against Oklahoma, any down can be an obvious
passing down.
Brown also said the Longhorn fans were a big factor in the team's comeback
win last year against OU. "They stayed positive when we fell behind," he
said.

RECRUITING NOTES: QB Brent Rawls, 6-5, 195, 4.7, of Shreveport Evangel,
said
he really enjoyed his official visit to Texas last weekend, but he said he
wants to take an official visit to Florida State the Oct. 14 weekend before
making a decision. He also has taken an official visit to Purdue and the
Boilermakers are very much in the picture because Rawls says they don't
have
as many young quarterbacks as Texas. . . DE Kevin Everett of  Port Arthur
Jefferson came to the game OSU game on an unofficial visit, and said he had
a
great time.  But he said he wants to make some official visits before
committing to anyone. . . QB Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch says he
would like to come to a Texas practice this week or next week. He visited
LSU
last weekend and had a great time, but he still says the Longhorns are his
No. 1 choice. He might commit to Texas when he comes to the team practice.
Nordgren is the best QB prospect in Texas and Rawls is the top one in
Louisiana, so the Horns just need to be sure they get one of them. . .
Super
LB Derrick Johnson of Waco had an incredible 30 tackles Friday night in his
team's loss to powerful Tyler John Tyler.

Scouting Kansas

The Longhorns have another long road trip this week, traveling to Lawrence =
to
take on Kansas at 1 p.m. Saturday. The game will not be televised.
The Jayhawks are 4-5. They lost to SMU, 31-17, to open the season, then bea=
t
Alabama-Birmingham, 23-20, and Southern Illinois, 42-0, before falling to
Oklahoma, 34-16, and Kansas State, 52-13.
Then they defeated Missouri, 38-17, and Colorado, 23-15, before dropping a
45-39 game to Texas Tech and then getting hammered by Nebraska, 56-17.
The Jayhawks have a unique offense. QB Dylen Smith is one of the rare
quarterbacks who feels just as comfortable running the option or dropping
back into a four-wide receiver set. He is 6-1, 190, and fast and shifty.
Texas coach Mack Brown says Smith "is a really athletic quarterback who has=
 a
great arm and who can make plays" with his arm or his quick feet.
He also says RB David Winbush, 5-7, 180, "is the leading rusher in Kansas
history, and that's a school that has had Gale Sayers and John Riggins" of
Chicago Bears and Washington Redskins fame, respectively.
WR Harrison Hill is one of the best in the league.
Defensively, nose tackle Nate Dwyer, 6-3, 300, is the anchor in the middle =
of
the line, and LBs Chaz Murphy, 6-3, 252, and Andrew LeClair, 6-6, 245, are
big run stoppers.
The Jayhawks are giving up more yards than they are gaining, which is never=
 a
good sign, but they have been impressive at times, particularly when they a=
re
playing at home.
The Longhorns are a 13-point favorite, but this is a dangerous road game
because Kansas has to beat Texas and then Iowa State next week to qualify f=
or
a bowl game.
To win the Horns need to start quickly, like they did in Lubbock, and the
defense needs to pressure Smith and keep Winbush under control.
If Major Applewhite's knee injury turns out to be serious, they also need t=
o
have a balanced offense to keep all the pressure from falling on Chris Simm=
s'
inexperienced shoulders. They also need to score more touchdowns than field
goals when they get inside the 10.
Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):
Texas                             Kansas
Offense
(80)   121.7         Rushing Avg.          (39) 163.1
(15)   289.0         Passing Avg.          (78) 194.9

(12)     36.8        Scoring Avg           (64)   25.3

(20)   180.7         Passing Avg.          (39) 201.9
(5)   272.7       Total Def. Avg.        (56) 362.7

Big 12 Roundup

Nebraska visits Kansas State in a game that will decide the Northern Divisi=
on
crown Saturday, while top-ranked Oklahoma travels to Texas A&M in a huge ga=
me
in the Southern Division.
The winner of the Nebraska-Kansas State game is a virtual lock to represent
the North in the Big 12 championship game.
If Oklahoma beats A&M, the Sooners also will be assured of a spot in the
title game. But if the Aggies pull an upset, then a three-way tie would exi=
st
in the South if Texas beats Kansas.

Recruiting Roundup

OL Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter created quite a stir last week when he
was quoted in the Dallas News as saying he remains committed to Texas, but
might take a visit or two just to be sure of his commitment.
Texas coach Mack Brown generally sees a commitment as being binding on both
parties. He tells recruits when they are ready to commit that UT will
guarantee them scholarships, and they are supposed to guarantee they will
honor their commitments and refrain from visiting other schools.
Scott has talked off an on about visiting other schools, but he hasn't set =
up
any visits yet. I'll keep you posted if he does.
* * * *
QB-Athlete Kendal Briles of Wollforth Frenship, another UT pledge, says
Nebraska continues to recruit him, but he says he is solid for the Longhorn=
s.
* * * *
Central Texas normally doesn't have very many top recruits, but four of bes=
t
in the state and in the nation his year are in Central Texas and three of
them play in District 13-5A, which stretches from Waco in the north to
Georgetown in the south.
Those four recruits will go a long ways toward determining whether the
Longhorns have a great recruiting class or just a very good one.
The 13-5A players are DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison, LB Derrick Johns=
on
of Waco and DB Dewayne Brandon of Temple.
The other top prospect is QB-Athlete Quan Cosby of Mart, who led his team t=
o
a 15-0 record and a Class 2A state title last year.
Texas is recruiting all four of them and has the lead with Johnson, Brandon
and Cosby. Harris has favored Texas when he lists a preference, but he has
been more noncommital about his college choice recently.
Texas has a good chance to get all four of them and that would really put t=
he
icing on an already outstanding recruiting class.
Student Sports magazine currently has UT ranked No. 2 behind Michigan in th=
e=20
national recruiting rankings.
If the Horns get three or four of those Central Texans I mentioned earlier,
they will have a great shot at the top spot.
And for those of you who have expressed concern that the Longhorns' two-los=
s
season could pose a problem, Michigan has three losses already. A 7-2 seaso=
n
at this point is a very good year to sell to recruits.
I still expect the Longhorns to sign 25 or 26 kids. With 19 already
committed, that leaves room for only six or seven more players.
* * * *
In addition to the obvious recruiting targets I have been writing about
recently, there are two super prospects in Louisiana who are talking about
taking official visits to Texas the weekend of the Texas-Texas A&M game.
They are DT Marquise Hill, 6-7, 290, 5.1, of New Orleans De La Salle and TE
Marcus Spears, 6-5, 270, 4.75, of Baton Rouge Southern Lab.
The two Louisiana prospects and DL Kaelen Jakes, 6-4, 265, 4.75, of Valenci=
a,
Cal., are the only out-of-state prospects on the Longhorn radar screen at
this time. UT has a very good shot at Jakes. Hill and Spears are long shots=
.

Lee Jackson Out Indefinitely; OSU Game Set for ABC-TV at 11 a.m.

Longhorn strong safety Lee Jackson has a pulled hamstring and will miss
Saturday's 6 p.m. game with Houston, coach Mack Brown said Monday. He said
Jackson is out indefinitely.
Brown said Jackson was the Longhorns best blitzer from the secondary. He
said
redshirt freshman Dakarai Pearson or senior Joe Walker will take his place.
He also said free safety Greg Brown could play strong safety and he could
move Pearson or Walker to strong safety.
"Our safeties are pretty interchangeable," he said.
Brown also defended the Longhorn offensive line, saying it was responsible
for only one of the five sacks Stanford rang up. He said one was caused by
a
running back failing to pick up the blitz and the other three were due to
some missed communications between QB Major Applewhite and his receivers.
"Believe it or not, the protection has been much better with the offensive
line," he said.
He said WR Montrell Flowers was chosen as the best offensive player against
Stanford, while DT Casey Hampton took defensive honors and punt returner
Hodges Mitchell was the top special teams performe.
Brown said Houston will be much like Stanford when it comes to throwing
long
pass after long pass.
He also said the team will practice Tuesday night to give the players as
much
rest as possible after the hard road trip to California. He said night
games
that far away are really tiring because of the long flight home immediately
after the game.
He also said that was the primary reason he wanted the Hawaii game to be
cancelled. "You need to have an open date after a game that far away," he
said.
* * * *
ABC-TV has picked the Texas-Oklahoma State game Sept. 30 in Austin for a
regional telecast. The time has been set for 11 a.m.
* * * *
FOOTBALL NOTES: Texas leads the Big 12 in passing offense with 366.5 yards
per game, but the Longhorns are dead last in rushing yardage at 50 yards
per
game. Even lowly Baylor, 11th in the league, is averaging 81.5 yards per
game
rushing. . . Texas leads its series with Houston, 13-7-2, and has won the
last four matches between the two teams. . . The Longhorns are 11-2 at home
since Mack Brown became the head coach. . . Brown hasn't named a starting
QB
for the Houston game, but it probably will be Major Applewhite. He started
the Stanford game and guided the team on 14 of its 18 possessions.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: Texas now has 15 commitments, after picking up pledges
from
LB Lance McFarland and RB Anthony Johnson, both of Jefferson, last week.
Johnson ran for more than 200 yards in a losing effort against defending
Class 3A champ Texarkana Liberty-Eylau, and he is one of the top backs I
have
seen on tape this year. McFarland is a hard-nosed tackler with good speed
who
could play inside or outside linebacker . . . LB Derrick Johnson of Waco is
about as good a linebacker as I have seen in Texas recently. He is 6-3 or
6-4
and weighs around 210 and he can really run. He has the frame to carry 230
pounds without losing any speed. He says Texas is still his No. 1 choice,
but
he also says he probably will take all five official visits before making a
decision. Other schools in contention are A&M, FSU, Oklahoma and UCLA, but
he
says, "I'd like to play pretty close to home so my friends and family could
see me play." That bodes well for Texas and Texas A&M. . . FB James
Buchanon
of Sarasota, Fla., says he is coming to the Texas-Houston game and will
take
his official visit to Texas this weekend. DE Eric Hall of Clarksville,
Tenn.,
is the only other recruit who has taken an official visit to Texas so far
this year.

We had a quiet, uneventful fourth.? We helped my parents move to Humble over 
the weekend and then came home Monday afternoon.? This weekend we're headed 
to Dallas to see friends.? Bryan, Brackhahn, Tom Kimpel, Jenn Price, and some 
of our friends are going to the Metallica concert on Sunday.? 

If we don't see y'all this summer, then we'll have to get together for the 
first football game on September 9th. 

Take care and tell Jenn we said hello.

--Monica, Bryan, & Tori

Monica, 
Just wanted to say hi.? Jenn moved to Houston last Thursday.? We were busy 
getting her apartment set up over the holiday weekend, but she still has a 
long way to go.? She started her new job today at Conoco.? We went to watch 
fireworks last night in downtown Houston.? It was pretty cool.? They had 
the Beach Boys there.? It looks like she may be buying a new car soon. 
Hers is not doing so well.? In fact, she is borrowing my Celica right now. 
I hope y'all had a good Fourth, and tell Bryan we said hi. 

Clint

Game Quotes . .

"Texas has great team speed. That return guy (Nathan Vasher) was spectacular,
just spectacular. He was the back-breaker for us. There is no doubt about it
- he was the difference in the ball game in my opinion. We were in the game
and had some momentum, and then he started running those punts back down our
throat. Mack Brown has done a great job at Texas. They really have some
outstanding athletes."
- North Carolina head coach John Bunting
* * * *
"It seemed like everyone was hitting their blocks on my returns, so usually I
just had to try to make one guy miss. It was a lot of fun. Now, I just have
to get back to work to try to get better."
- UT safety/punt returner Nathan Vasher
* * * *
"It's great to put (freshman LB Derrick Johnson) in pass-rush situations
because he's got some shake and bake the Good Lord gave him. He's still
learning what to do, and by mid-season I think he'll really make a mark. He's
already made a little bit of a mark in my mind."
- Texas defensive coordinator Carl Reese
* * * *
"I just read the quarterback's eyes. When I got the ball, I ran as hard as I
could and then I jumped as high as I could. I was not going to be denied. I
wanted that touchdown."
- UT DE Cory Redding, talking about his 22-yard interception return for the
game's first score
* * * *
"I was really excited about getting to play against him (heralded North
Carolina DE Julius Peppers). He's got a great first step and he's really
fast. He's got real long arms, too, which helps him on  his pass rush. I felt
like I did pretty good. I know I gave it all I had and played as hard as I
could on every play. I got some help from other guys a lot of the time."
- Longhorn OT Robbie Doane, who was primarily responsible for holding Peppers
without a tackle or a sack
* * * *
"I questioned myself a little on that one just before the half. It was 49
yards and going into the wind, but I marked off my steps, took a deep breath
and told myself to kick right through the ball and drive it. I was really
excited when it went in. It gave the team a lift."
- Texas true freshman walk-on kicker Dusty Mangum, who booted a 49-yard field
goal into the wind on the last play of the first half to give Texas a 20-14
lead at intermission.
* * * *
"Our defense was unbelievable. They kept us in the game and then the special
teams kind of drove the dagger in their heart. Nathan Vasher is great. He got
the whole team and everybody in the stands excited."
- UT QB Chris Simms

Scouting Houston

The Longhorns have an open date this week, and then they hit the road for the
first time this year and travel to Houston to play the Cougars at 8 p.m. on
September 22 in tiny Robertson Stadium.
The Cougars lost to cross-town rival Rice, 21-14, in their season opener and
had their open date last week. Things won't get any easier for them this week
because they travel to Athens to play the Georgia Bulldogs.
The Owls controlled the ball and the clock against Houston, rolling up 354
yards with their wishbone attack.
So, if the Longhorns are ever going to get their running game going, they
won't have a better opportunity all season.
Against Rice, Houston had only 199 yards offensively, and 192 of that was
through the air. So it looks like the Cougars can't run and can't stop the
run.
QB Kelly Robertson is UH's main offensive threat and his top target is WR
Brian Robinson, while the defense is led by CB Jason Parker.
The Cougars went 3-8 a year ago in coach Dana Dimel's first year. They have
eight returning starters on offense and six on defense.

Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):
Texas                       Houston

(45)   165               Rushing Avg.        (115)     7

Longhorn Notes . .

 Sophomore Nathan Vasher broke Johnny Johnson's school record for single-game
punt return yardage with 153 yards on eight returns. Johnson gained 131 yards
against Boston College in 1977. Vasher's 44-yard touchdown return in the
fourth quarter broke a long dry spell. It was the first for the Longhorns
since Mike Adams ran one back in 1993, a mere 98 games ago. ... Backup
quarterback Major Applewhite got into the game late in the fourth quarter,
but he added to his list of records with two pass attempts to overtake Peter
Gardere in the category. Applewhite has now thrown 1,025 passes, and holds or
is tied for 41 school records.. . . North Carolina had only 52 net yards and
made only two first downs in the second half, both in the fourth quarter. . .
The Tar Heels dominated time of possession in the first half, holding the
ball for 18:02 compared to the Longhorns 11;58, but Texas had the ball for
more than 20 minutes of the 30-minute second half (20:08 to 9:52).

Big 12 Roundup

Nebraska thumped Notre Dame, 27-10, at home, and Kansas State whipped USC,
10-6, on the road  in top intersectional games involving Big 12 teams last
week.
It was a great week overall for the Big 12 because league teams won 11 games,
with Kansas losing to UCLA for the only blemish.

Baseball Team Gets 2 Pledges

 The Longhorn baseball team got commitments Sunday from two of the state's
top players.
Andrew Casares, 6-3, 217, a switch-hitting outfielder who batted .431 and hit
eight home runs as a junior at Corpus Christi Carroll, chose Texas over Rice,
Houston, Oklahoma State and others. Carroll went 29-4 last season.
He also led the Ohio Thunder, an AAU team, in hitting last summer with a .424
average and five home runs.
J. Brent Cox, 6-3, 195, a right-handed pitcher who went 9-2 last year as a
junior at Bay City, picked the Horns over Arizona State, Miami, Rice,
Nebraska, Baylor and others.
Cox has an outstanding slider, a fast ball in the 88-90 mph range and fine
control. He gave up an average of four hits and two walks per game while
striking out about 10 per game.

Basketball Recruiting

One of the top basketball recruits in the nation is  Brad Buckman, a 6-8
power forward at Austin Westlake, and he is strongly considering the Longhorns
.
His father, Brent, played on two national championship golf teams (1971 &
1972) at Texas with Ben Crenshaw and Tom Kite. His mother, Tammy, also is a
Texas grad.
Buckman, who had a great summer in AAU basketball, has narrowed his choices
to Texas, Kansas, UCLA and North Carolina.
Buckman is ranked as a national top 50 recruit.
There also are three nationally-ranked guards in Texas this year, but the
Longhorns lost out on all three of them.
The best of the bunch, Bracey Wright of  The Colony, picked Indiana last
week, Brian Hopkins of  Dallas Lincoln chose SMU over Texas Wednesday, and
Daniel Horton of Cedar Hill picked Michigan several weeks ago.

Part 2 of 3

Horns Heading for Another Top Recruiting Class

Texas has an even dozen commitments, after getting a pledge from DT Tully
Janszen, 6-4, 245, 4.78, of Keller on August 2
He picked Texas over Oklahoma. He had considered only Texas, OU and A&M, and
had offers from all three.
The Longhorns, who have had three straight top five national recruiting
classes, are on track to make it four in a row.
They already have pledges from six recruits who have been on one or more
national top 100 lists, including three other DT prospects - Sonny Davis of
Gulf Coast JC in Mississippi and formerly of Austin Lanier, Earl Anderson of
San Marcos and Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale Chaparral, the two-time defending
Arizona state champion.
The other UT commitments who have been on some top national lists are OLs
Brett Valdez of Brownwood and Neale Tweedie of Allen and TE David Thomas of
Wolfford Frenship (a complete list of all the Longhorn pledges is on page 7).
Janszen said the Longhorn coaches told him they want him to play DT, and he
said they told him they like his quickness and aggressiveness.
He said when he called Texas head coach Mack Brown to tell him he wanted to
play for the Longhorns. "He seemed real happy to hear from me."
While Brown can't talk about specific recruits until they sign, he has said
he wants defensive linemen who can really run because of all the spread
offenses that are the vogue in the Big 12.
Janszen has great explosion at the line of scrimmage and is very fast for a
DT.
He said he picked Texas because "I liked the way I was treated by the coaches
and players. They are like a big family."
After informally visiting all three of his finalists, he said UT was an easy
choice. "The players and coaches are so much friendlier than at other places.
I really felt at home there."
He alo said his sister lives at New Braunfels, which is between Austin and
San Antonio.  "Her husband is a coach at Converse Judson," he said. "It will
be good to have family that close."
Janszen said he had 10 sacks and about 15 other tackles for losses last year.
He has a 3.0 GPA on a 4.0 scale and has a 22 ACT score, which is well above
the qualifying score.
* * * *
When I quoted Marquis Johnson's mother in my last issue as saying he made it
to Texas, but never got to Austin, it turns out she didn't know the whole
story.
Johnson, a national top 100 receiver from Champaign, Ill., visited with a
friend in the Dallas area and told me they drove to Austin one weekend and
looked around, but said his mother didn't know that when I talked to her.
"The coaches didn't know I was coming that day and they weren't around," he
said, "but we looked around a lot and I really liked what I saw. Austin is a
nice town and I've always been a fan of the University of Texas football
team."
Johnson told me he is very close to committing to Texas and probably will
take his official visit the August 31 weekend and see the Horns' September 1
opener against New Mexico State.
He said there is a good chance he will commit during his visit.
Out-of-state recruits can take official visits during football season. Texas
recruits have to wait until their seasons are over or, under UIL rules, they
would lose their eligibility to finish their high school football season.
Johnson is a great prospect because he is big and fast and doesn't mind
making the tough catch in traffic. He also has great hands and seldom misses
a catchable ball.
"I like to make the catch and get out of trouble as quick as I can," he said,
"but I don't mind taking a hit, too. It's a challenge to hang on to the ball
when someone is hitting on you."
There are three big-time recruits I think the Longhorns are almost certain to
sign. They are Johnson, DT Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch, Colo., and DT
Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings.
Wright is the top defensive tackle prospect in the country and the best
player in Texas. Studdard is one of the top players in Colorado and Johnson
is one of the top recruits in Illinois.
Texas also leads with several other top players, including LB Aaron Harris of
North Mesquite and DT Marco Martin of Mesquite. Harris is the state's top
inside linebacker.
DE Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel, the younger brother of Cole Pittman,
the sophomore DT at UT who was tragically killed in an automobile accident in
February, has narrowed his choices to Texas and LSU.
The Longhorns have dedicated their second game, against North Carolina, to
Cole Pittman, and the Pittman family will be in attendance. I expect Chase
Pittman to announce his college choice very quicly after that.
Pittman and another nationally recruited DE, Bryan Pickryl of Jenks, Okla.,
both plan to graduate in December and enroll in college in January so they
can go through spring training.
Pickryl hasn't narrowed his choices to two teams, but he has a big three of
UCLA, Texas and Missouri and the Longhorns are at least tied with UCLA for
the lead at this point.
Oklahoma can't be counted out, but he took an unofficial visit to OU about 10
days ago, and came home saying the Sooners still hadn't moved into his top
three.
His grandmother and two uncles live in Austin, but his father graduated from
UCLA.
He's also an excellent student who wants to go to a very good academic
school, which probably is a major reason Texas, UCLA and Missouri rank ahead
of OU.
* * * *
My list of the top 25 players in Texas includes three players (No. 3 DT Earl
Anderson, No. 17 LB Brian Robison and No. 23 OL Brett Valdez) who are already
committed to Texas.
The Longhorns also are in strong contention for No. 1 DT Wright, No. 3 DE
Travis Leitko of The Woodlands, No. 6 RB Albert Hardy of Galena Park, No. 7
DE Larry Dibbles of Lancaster, No. 8 Ath Edorian McCullough of North Garland,
No. 9 LB Harris, No. 11 LB Garnett Smith of Arlington Lamar, No. 14 OL Justin
Blalock of Plano East, No. 15 DT Martin, No. 16 CB Ricky Wilson of Port
Arthur Lincoln, No. 21 DE Dontriel Coates of Anahuac and No. 22 Ath DaBryan
Blanton of Carrollton Turner.
Wright and Hardy both attended UT practices last week.
There are some other guys in my top 25 who are interested in UT, including
No. 2 QB Vincent Young of Houston Madison, and No. 19 WR Robert Timmons of
Flower Mound Marcus, but Young seems to be leaning toward going out of state
and Timmons drew a three-game suspension from his coach last week for
unidentified transgressions.
There are some other great players in the group who have serious academic
deficiencies.
* * * *
FB-LB Brandon Hancock of Clovis, Cal., has committed to USC. As I noted in my
last newsletter, he said he enjoyed his unofficial visit to Texas, but was
almost certain he would sign with a California school.
A national top 100 prospect in California who has expressed some interest in
Texas is QB Trent Edwards, 6-4, 185, 4.7, of Los Gatos, who completed an
incredible 78% of his passes last year for 2,529 yards and 29 TDs. Stanford
leads, however.

Texas' Early Commitments

These are the 12 recruits who already have committed to Texas:
1. OL Brett Valdez, 6-4, 310, 5.2, Brownwood
2. DT Sonny Davis, 6-1, 320, 5.0, Austin Lanier  and Gulf Coast, Miss., JC
3. DT Earl Anderson, 6-3, 265, 4.8, San Marcos
4. DT Lyle Sendlein, 6-4, 260, 4.8, Scottsdale Chaparral
5. Ath Clint Haney, 5-11, 185, 4.27, Smithson Valley
6. QB Billy Don Malone, 6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7, Paris North Lamar
7. WR Dustin Miksch, 6-0, 167, 4.35, Round Rock Westwood
8. TE David Thomas, 6-3, 210, 4.55, Wolfforth Frenship
9. LB Marcus Myers, 6-3, 220, 4.5 Pflugerville Connally
10. OL Neale Tweedie, 6-5, 255, 4.9, Allen
11. LB Brian Robison, 6-3, 243, 4.6, Splendora
12. DT Tully Jantzen, 6-4, 255, 4.8, Keller
Robison was named the outstanding male performer at the AAU Junior Olympics
in Norfolk, Va. He broke his own national AAU Junior Olympic record by
winning the discus with a 202-7 throw and was second in the shot and sixth in
the javelin.
FUTURE RECRUITING NOTE: John David Booty, 6-3, 185, 4.56, will be the
starting QB in the Shreveport Evangel's famed passing offense this year, and,
as a sophomore, he's already being featured in national sports magazines and
compared favorably with past Evangel QBs like Brock Berlin. He has been a
visitor at Longhorn practices and mentions Texas as one of his favorite
schools. I know he won't be a senior for a long time, but write his name in
your futures book if you have one because he'll be the top recruit in the
country in two years unless he gets hurt. He already has a powerful arm,
quick release, great accuracy and real speed for a QB and was the top signal
caller at the Nike camp in Baton Rouge.

Longhorn Notes . .
* Although the team isn't in full pads yet, the one-on-one drills between
offensive and defensive linemen get pretty fierce at times. DT Marcus Tubbs,
DE Kalen Thornton and DT Maurice Gordon have been very impressive getting
around and through the blockers, and OTs Mike Williams and Alfio Randall have
been the best at keeping the rushers at bay in the drills I've watched.
* The Longhorn defense is going to be less predictable this season. The team
has been working on zone blitzes and other innovative schemes and even has
defensive ends dropping off into pass coverage at times. "We want to disguise
what we are doing and try to confuse the quarterback and make him hold on to
the ball longer, which gives us a better chance to get to him," said head
coach Mack Brown.
* Senior WR Montrell Flowers has been one of the stars of the early
practices. He got behind the secondary and caught two long touchdown passes
from QB Chris Simms in the Saturday and Sunday workouts. The early battles
between the receivers and the secondary have been exciting to watch.
* Brown says TE Bo Scaife appears to be completely recovered from his knee
surgeries. "Bo's a valuable part of this football teamm when he is healthy,"
he said, "and he's looking great. He's in the best shape he's been in and he
knows he's well now. He can help us a lot this season.

Part 2 of 3

Seniors Honored

The Longhorns honored their senior football players Saturday in their final
game at Royal Memorial Stadium.
QB Major Applewhite drew two tremendous ovations, one when he entered the
game in the fourth quarter and another when he was relieved by redshirt
freshman Chance Mock.
Applewhite hold most UT passing records, but lost his starting job to Chris
Simms after severe injuries to both knees limited his mobility.
Nine senior starters - three on offense and six one defense - also were
honored.
The offensive senior starters are tackle Mike Williams, guard Antwan
Kirk-Hughes and center Matt Anderson.
The defensive senior starters are tackle Maurice Gordon, linebackers De'Andre
Lewis, Everick Rawls and Tyrone Jones, cornerback Quentin Jammer and safety
Ahmad Brooks.
Other scholarship seniors include tight end Mike Jones, cornerback Ervis
Hill, defensive ends Jermain Anderson and Marcus Wilkins and defensive tackle
Corey Bradford.
Senior walk-ons include defensive back Nathan Kaspar, wide receiver Marcus
Walther, running back Kyle Hunt, offensive lineman Robbie Nethercutt and
defensive ends Travis Slagle and Chris Stroup.

Game Quotes . .

"They are right up there with the best teams we've played. They are extremely
gifted defensively and they run well. They are without a doubt the best
secondary we have played this season."
- Kansas interim head coach Tom Hayes, who became acting head coach last
Monday when Terry Allen was fired. The Jayhawks schedule has been voted the
toughest in the country
* * * *
"I thought it was a great team game. The offense got 600 yards and the
defense held the other team to 60. I wish they were all like that. Our kids
played really hard and I'm proud of them."
- Texas defensive coordinator Carl Reese
* * * *
"I'm just really pleased overall and I'm glad Cedric (Benson) finally had a
long run so you will quit asking him about it."
- UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis, who was picking up on a comment by
Benson that he was glad to pop a long one so people would quit asking him
what was wrong
* * * *
"As a kid, this is what you dream about. My dreams are falling into place. If
I continue to work hard, 1,000 yards will come. I have a great offensive
line, a great fullback, a great quarterback and great coaches. With all that,
what can't be done?"
 - Longhorn RB Cedric Benson, talking about his  chances of becoming the
first UT freshman to rush for 1,000 yards
* * * *
"He's probably running full speed at three steps. He hits the line of
scrimmage at full speed. He attacks the line of scrimmage and he usually
falls forward. He's one of the quickest guys I've ever seen. I don't think it
takes him long to go from zero to 60."
 - Texas running back coach Bruce Chambers, talking about Benson
* * * *
"We never gave up. I felt the offensive line played hard the whole game.
Unfortunately, that doesn't always translate into wins. Texas has an
extremely talented defense and they came out and showed us exactly that
today."
- Kansas offensive tackle Justin Hartwig
* * * *
"He's the best I've ever gone against. Size, speed, he has it all. I've never
seen a guy that big who can run that fast."
- Kansas cornerback Andrew Davidson, talking about trying to cover Roy
Williams
* * * *
"I thought that if we kept them from scoring for the rest of the first half,
holding the score to 21-0, then maybe we could come back, but Texas kept
making big plays and the next thing you know it was 59-0. Their skill players
are unbelievable.."
- Kansas defensive lineman  Brock Teddleton

Scouting Texas A&M

Texas and Texas A&M both have open dates this week to get ready for their
annual showdown the Friday after Thanksgiving.
It's in College Station this year and it has an 11 a.m. kickoff and will be
televised by ABC.
In case you have forgotten, they had an early kickoff in College Station two
years ago and the Longhorns, with a sick quarterback and two injured wide
receivers, got beat, 20-16.
There were some other factors, but suffice it to say the Longhorns won't stay
in College Station the night before the game this year.
Texas is 9-1 overall and 6-1 in the Big 12, while A&M is 7-3 overall and 4-3
in the Big 12.
The Aggies have had offensive problems all year and the situation has
mushroomed in the last two games when they were shut out by Texas Tech and
then held to five first downs by Oklahoma in a 31-10 loss Saturday.
Both teams have solid defenses, but UT has an edge in all four major
defensive categories, as you can see in the statistical rankings below.
But the Longhorns also have one of the nation's most potent offenses and that
should negate the Aggies' home field advantage.
To win this one, the Longhorns need to stay with their balanced offensive
attack, connect on some big plays and, above all, don't turn the ball over
and give the Aggies a short field.
This Aggie team has had difficulty making drives, and hasn't scored an
offensive touchdown in its last two games. It won't have much luck against
the strong Longhorn defense.
The keys here are simple:
1. Win the turnover battle.
2. Don't accept any food or drink from strangers.
I'm usually a little more serious about trips to Collie Station, but this
Aggie team's best offense is its defense, and that won't be enough on Nov. 23.
If you followed the news about the melee in Lubbock after Tech's 12-0 victory
over A&M, these two thoughts come to mind:
1. Only Aggies would go all the way to Lubbock to fight each other.
2. Only Aggies would sit in the stands at a hostile field and wait 30 minutes
for the other team's fans to tear down the goal posts.
Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):

Four Named to Honor Hall

Three former University of Texas standout female student-athletes and one
distinguished former coach were honored Friday by induction  as members of
the second class of the UT Women's Athletics Hall of Honor.
The four inductees were:
* Nell Fortner, a volleyball and basketball standout from 1977-81, who
starred on UT's 1981 Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women
(AIAW) national championship volleyball team and is a nationally-renowned
basketball coach at the college, USA Basketball and WNBA levels.
She coached the gold-medalist 2000 U.S. Olympic basketball team before
assuming her current role as general manager and head coach of the WNBA's
Indiana Fever.
* Joan Pennington Dyer, an  AIAW national swimming champion and former
national swimmer of the year, who swam from UT from 1978-80 and from 1982-84.
* Retha Swindell, All-American basketball standout from 1975-79,  who is the
only player in Longhorn history to surpass the 1,500 mark in both career
points and rebounds and who went on to play professional basketball.
* Pat Weis was the first Longhorn women's golf coach who served in that role
from 1974-93 and coached UT to six top 10 finishes at the AIAW National
Championships and coached numerous Longhorn golfers to both All-America and
National Player of the Year honors.

Recruiting Roundup

The big Longhorn recruiting weekend this year will be Dec. 15-17 and will b=
e
built around the annual football banquet.
Nearly all of the 19 recruits who have already committed to Texas have chos=
en
that weekend to visit, and so have most of the players the Longhorns are
still recruiting.
The list of players the Longhorns are still seriously recruiting is
continuing to shrink.
At this point, there are 10 recruits left on the board who (a) have offers =
or
will get offers if they check out okay academically, and (b) are strongly
considering the Longhorns.
They are DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison, LB Derrick Johnson of Waco, D=
L
Kaelen Jakes of Valencia, Cal.; TE James Moses and DE Jonathan Jackson, bot=
h
of Galena Park North Shore; OL Jamie Hightower of Jacksonville, OL William
Winston of Houston Madison, safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple, athlete Quan
Cosby of Mart and DT Paul Broussard of Blinn JC.
Most of the remaining six or seven scholarships will go to the players in
that group.
Johnson, Jakes, Moses, Jackson and Brandon all list Texas No. 1 at this
point, and it is possible the Longhorns will get all five of them.
Winston also says Texas is tops with him right now, but he also wants to lo=
ok
at several out-of-state schools.
Harris is the remaining recruit who is No. 1 on my wish list, for two
excellent reasons. First, he is the top DT prospect in the country. Second,
he is the only top DT who is considering the Longhorns.
But Oklahoma is making a big run at him, and he is listening. He also is
being heavily recruited by Florida State and he plans to visit the Seminole=
s
this weekend.
Harris earlier listed Texas No. 1, but now says the Sooners and Seminoles a=
re
his top two teams.
He plans to visit Texas the Dec. 15 weekend, and has another trip set up to
Texas A&M the Dec. 8 weekend.
There actually is another top DT who is interested in Texas =01) Broussard =
=01) but
he has many academic hurdles to clear.
Jakes has already visited Texas, and the other nine players in that 10-man
grouping all say they plan to visit Texas the Dec. 15 weekend unless their
teams are still in the high school playoffs.
Their teams will have to be really good to be still in the playoffs at that
point because that will be the weekend of the state semifinals in some
classes and the finals in other classes.
There are some other great prospects who are  long shots, but are still in
the picture. They are headed by DT Marquise Hill, 6-6, 300, 5.0, of New
Orleans De La Salle, and DE Justin Tomerlin, 6-7, 260, of San Clemente, Cal=
.
Tomerlin has been committed to Florida State for several weeks, but now say=
s
he wants to visit several other schools, including Texas. He says he still =
is
committed to FSU. I'm not sure he will visit, but, if he does, there is a
chance.
Hill says he will take an official visit to  Texas the Thanksgiving weekend
and will attend the Texas-A&M game.
Hill has already visited LSU and plans to visit Michigan the Dec. 1 weekend=
,
Georgia the Dec. 8 weekend and Georgia Tech the Dec. 15 weekend.
He said his big three are Michigan, LSU and Texas.

Here's a list of the Horns' 19 early commitments:
Offensive Line (7)
Jonathan Scott, 6-7, 290, 4.9, Dallas Carter
Abe Robinson, 6-6, 270, 4.9, Jersey Village

The Bowl Picture

If the Longhorns defeat Texas A&M on the Friday after Thanksgiving, they wi=
ll
wind up in the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, the Holiday Bowl in San Diego or the
Alamo Bowl in San Antonio.
Those three bowls get the top three picks from the Big 12, in that order,
after the BCS takes the league champion.
Conventional wisdom holds that Texas and the Cotton Bowl won't hook up agai=
n
because the Longhorns have already played there on two consecutive New Year=
's
Days.
But don't be too sure. The Cotton Bowl brass likes the Longhorns and Texas
coach Mack Brown loves New Year's Day bowls.
If that doesn't come to pass, then it will be either the Holiday or Alamo
bowl for the Longhorns.
What if Texas loses to Texas A&M? I hate to consider the unthinkable, and I
won't until and unless that happens.
But if it does, we'll all need to do some research on the Insight.com Bowl,
the Independence Bowl and maybe the Gallery.furniture.com Bowl.

UT Women Impressive

Sophomore guard Tai Dillard scored a career-high 17 points and led three
Longhorns in double-figure scoring as Texas captured a 71-47 victory over
Tulane Sunday at the Erwin center in the second round of the 2000 Preseason
Women's National Invitation Tournament (WNIT).
With the win, Texas (2-0) advances to the Preseason WNIT semifinal and
championship rounds next Sunday and Monday, at a site to be determined.
Texas joins No. 9 Louisiana Tech and No. 15 Virginia in the four-team
semifinals. No. 4 Purdue hosts Georgetown today (Monday) in the final game =
to
determine the fourth semifinalist.
The Preseason WNIT semifinal pairings will be: Texas versus the
Purdue-Georgetown winner, and Louisiana Tech versus Virginia.
The Preason WNIT committee has announced that if Purdue defeats Georgetown,
then the Boilermakers will serve as the host school for the Preseason WNIT
semifinals Sunday and third-place and championship games Monday in West
Lafayette, Indiana.
If Georgetown upsets Purdue, then the Preseason WNIT semifinals and
championship round will be hosted by Texas at the Erwin Center. The site an=
d
times will be announced late Monday.
Joining Dillard in double-figure scoring were junior forward Tracy Cook, wh=
o
tallied 12 points and senior guard JoRuth Woods, who chipped in with 11
points.
Woods added a team-high seven rebounds and had five assists, which tied her
best career night total.
Texas shot 43.5 percent from the floor (27-of-62), while the Green Wave (1-=
1)
hit 41.3 percent of their shots (19-for-46).
Texas shot 50% from the field in the first half en route to a 36-22 lead in
the win over Tulane.
Tulane turned the ball over 26 times, while UT committed 15 turnovers.
The Horns also held an advantage in steals (14 to nine), while Tulane
out-rebounded Texas, 38-37. UT also scored 27 points off turnovers to
Tulane's 10.
Texas had advanced to the WNIT second round with Friday's 72-47 win over
Wichita State, while Tulane bested Grambling State, 92-64, in the first
round.
Woods had 16 points and Cook  added 14 points in the victory over Wichita
State in the season opener for both squads.
The Longhorns, who never trailed in the game, were aided by an outstanding
22-for-26 effort from the free throw line, as they hit 84.6 percent of thei=
r
foul shots.
The Longhorns also shot 53.3 percent from the floor and outscored the
Shockers 34-14 in the paint.
Wichita State was held to a 29.2 percent shooting performance, as the
Shockers hit just 14 of 48  shots. WSU also turned the ball over 27 times,
while UT committed 21 turnovers.
Also scoring in double figures against Wichita State were Dillard, who had =
13
points, and freshman forward Stacy Stephens, who had 13 points, a game-high
eight rebounds and had a game-high seven steals in her first game as a
Longhorn.
In both their games, the Longhorns have shown much better quickness and
athleticism as a team than they showed last season.
"This was a good first outing for us," Conradt said. "We wanted to have a
strong effort on the defensive end of the floor, and we succeeded."
"We are starting and playing a lot of young people" she said, "and at this
point in time I think we have the athletic ability, the quickness and the
depth to play solid defense and press."
"Success starts with defense, and we were really good again today on "D","
Conradt added. "We came out with excellent intensity on defense, and it
helped that we started off shooting strongly."
"As we look ahead to the WNIT semifinals and if Purdue wins against
Georgetown, then we'll be playing on the road in West Lafayette," Conradt
said.
"If we do go on the road, I think we all welcome the opportunity to see how
we stack up against a top 10 team, and how we handle the pressure of being
away from Austin."

True Orange Observations

I think it is time for the Texas Athletic Department to do some major soul
searching about the way it treats Longhorn football fans.
This season has set a modern day record for callous treatment of some of th=
e
most loyal fans in all of college football.
First, there was that unconscionable 11 a.m. kickoff of the
Lousiana-Lafayette game in early
September and then another 11 a.m. kickoff for the Oklahoma game.
I know some older Longhorn fans who had to miss the Louisiana-Lafayette gam=
e
because their doctors told them it would be hazardous to their health to
attend because they would be exposed to a potentially deadly combination of
extreme heat and three to four solid hours of blazing sunlight beaming down
on them.
Both those games were on TV and that is always the excuse UT athletic
officials come up with when kickoff times are inconvenient.
Most of us go along with things like that because nearly all of our games a=
re
televised. Last season, 12 of the 14 were on TV.
But three games this season aren't being televised and two of them =01)
Colorado and Kansas =01) are the longest road trips the Longhorns have in B=
ig 12
Conference play.
The game in Colorado was nixed to allow Texas A&M at Baylor to be televised=
,
and the Kansas game this Saturday won't be televised so the Iowa State at
Colorado game can be aired.
I know the TV folks don't worry about fan inconvenience, but UT athletic
officials certainly should and one thing they should include in the deal if
they decide to inconvenience their fans with 11 a.m. kickoffs in early
September heat is assurance that the two longest road trips on the conferen=
ce
schedule won't be nixed for TV.
One subscriber who couldn't attend the La-La game because of his doctor's
orders told me Athletic Director Deloss Dodds should sit outside in the hea=
t
with the regular fans and he wouldn't ever have another 11 a.m. kickoff for=
 a
Sept. 9 game.
I think most fans are willing to accept some inconvenience, but I think the=
y
expect some sort of a trade off.
In other words, if we need to have some early games for TV, then we should
get preference on the TV for the faraway games, especially when they go up
against the likes of A&M at Baylor and Iowa State at Colorado.
It wouldn't have been a hard sell. But apparently no one in the UT Athletic
Department thought enough of the fans to ask for a quid pro quo.
Let's hope they do next year. After all, it takes pretty loyal fans to sell
out big stadiums Saturday after Saturday when their team hasn't finished in
the top 10 in 17 long years.

Horns Sign Fine Baseball Class

Texas baseball coach Augie Garrido has signed 12 of the top high school
players in Texas and throughout the country.
"Through the hard work of recruiting coordinator Tommy Harmon, Frank Anders=
on
and the entire baseball staff, we have once again been able to sign a
tremendous recruiting class for next season," Garrido said.
"This group includes some of the top prospects in the state and will help u=
s
maintain this program's tradition of excellence," he added.
The signees included right-handed pitchers Luis Cortez of Sinton, Joey
Guajardo of Round Rock and Donald Levinski of Weimar.
Cortez, who ranks fifth in his class academically, posted a 0.82 ERA last
season and averaged two strikeouts per inning en route to being named the
District 30-3A Junior of the Year.
Guajardo went 11-2 on the mound for Round Rock High School during the 2000
campaign and was chosen Central Texas Player of the Year after boasting a
0.91 ERA, recording 172 strikeouts over 85 innings of work and pitching fou=
r
no-hitters.
Levinski led Weimar to the Class AA State Championship last year and earned
All-State accolades after registering a 14-1 record, an 0.70 ERA and 170
strikeouts over 95 innings of work.
Joining that trio is shortstop Michael Hollimon of Dallas Jesuit who batted
.373 last year with seven triples and was rated the 10th best prospect at
this year's Area Code Games, plus two right-handed pitcherswho also double =
as
shortstops. They are Kole Strayhorn of Shawnee, Okla., who posted an 8-1
record with a 0.97 ERA and 99 strikeouts over 60 innings, and Huston Street
of Austin Westlake, who not only earned second team All-Centex honors as a
pitcher with a 6-1 record and a 1.27 ERA last season, but is also the son o=
f
legendary UT pitcher and quarterback James Street.
"Our focus with this recruiting class was to add depth in the middle infiel=
d,
behind the plate and on the mound," Harmon said.  "With the players that we
have signed for next year, we believe that we have accomplished that goal."
UT also signed top catchers James Sweeney of Houston Bellaire,  one of the
best defensive catchers in the country, and Curtis Thigpen of Forney, who
batted .515 last season for Forney High School and is also regarded as an
outstanding defensive backstop and outfielder.
Other signees were Seth Johnston of Boerne, who hit .507 and was an
All-District shortstop;  for middle infielder Ryan Olivo of Grapevine, who
earned All-District honors after batting .450;   J.D. Reininger of Smithson
Valley, who earned All-District, All-City and All-State accolades while
pitching and playing both first and third base;  and right-hander Chas Tayl=
or
of Austin Westlake

Conradt Inks Super Class

Texas women's basketball coach Jody Conradt has signed the best player in=
=20
Texas, the best player in Oklahoma a member of Canada's Junior National Tea=
m,
and she also got the signature of a versatile guard-forward from Houston.
Joining the Longhorns next year will be 6-2 forward Kala Bowers of Woodward=
,
Oklahoma, a USA Today and Street & Smith All-American who is rated as the
16th best player in the nation by  the Rivals.com Top 100 recruiting servic=
e;
6-2 forward Heather Schreiber of Windthorst, an AAU All-American and
three-time First Team All-State performer rated as the No. 1 player in Texa=
s
by the Texas Girls Basketball Report and the Texas Hoops recruiting service=
;
6-2 forward Jody Bell of Chestermere High School in Alberta, Canada, a memb=
er
of the 2000 Canadian Junior National Team, and 5-11 All-State guard Colenci=
a
"Coco" Reed of Houston Jersey Village, ranked as the 18th best player in
Texas by Texas Hoops.
Bowers was one of only four high school players invited to the 2000 USA
Basketball Junior National Team Trials.
She averaged 16 points, 7.4 rebounds, three assists and three blocks per ga=
me
as a junior last year as she led Woodward to the Oklahoma state championshi=
p
game. Woodward won the state crown her sophomore year, and has lost  just t=
wo
games over the last two seasons, going 53-2.
Bowers had scholarship offers from more than a dozen top schools. She
narrowed it down to Colorado and Texas before picking the Longhorns. Illino=
is
and Kansas State were other schools she strongly considered.
Schreiber was named an AAU All-American this past summer while leading her
Texas AAU 17-Under squad to a third-place finish at the AAU National
Championships while averaging 21 points 13 rebounds and five assists per ga=
me.
An outstanding three-sport All-State athlete in basketball, volleyball and
track & field, Schreiber averaged 24.4 points, 10 rebounds, 5.2 steals, 4
assists and 3.4 blocks per game for Texas' 1A power Windthorst as a junior.
As a junior, Schreiber  shot 62 percent from the floor and 45 percent from
three-point range. A star on the volleyball court, she has led Windthorst t=
o
three consecutive Texas state championships while being named State
Tournament MVP as a freshman, sophomore and junior.
On the track, Schreiber has cleared 5-10 in the high jump. She won the stat=
e
high jump crown as a sophomore and was runnerup in the high jump as a
freshman and junior and state runnerup in the long jump as a junior.
She had offered from many top schools, but committed to Texas very early in
the recruiting process.
Bell, a versatile 6-2 wing/post, was a starter on the 2000 Canadian Junior
National Team, which competed this past summer in the Tournament of the
Americas in Argentina, placing fifth.
Bell started four of the five games in the tournament. She has led
Chestermere High School to a No. 1 ranking in the province.
Named the province of 1998-99 Alberta 3A Rookie of the Year as a sophomore,
she led Chestermere to the 1999 AAA Provincial Championship.
Last season, Chestermere spent the year ranked No. 1 or No. 2 in the
province. In 83 games during her two-year high school career, Bell has
registered 1,303 points for a 15.7 ppg career scoring average, and is on pa=
ce
to set the school scoring record.
Entering her senior season, she holds career averages of 10.2 rebounds, 2.2
assists, 3.2 steals and 2.4 blocks per game.
She had offers from colleges all over Canada and the northern part of the
United States, but decided she wanted to head for warmer weather for her
college career and her other finalist was Arizona State.
Reed was All-State, All-District and All-Conference last season. She also i=
s
rated 112th nationally in the Reebok All-Star Report.
She helped lead Jersey Village into the 2000 Texas state playoffs, and her
playoff highlights included 21 points in a 63-39 win over Austin Bowie and =
22
points in a 66-57 quarterfinal loss to Austin's Westlake High School
"These four players will immediately raise the talent level of our program,
just as the class of 2000 signees has done," Conradt said.
"I am extremely pleased with our signings, and the talent level coming into
our program is the result of tremendous work done by our entire coaching
staff," she said.
"Each one of these players are considered among the very best players comin=
g
out of their respective states and, in Jody's case, in all of Canada,"
Conradt said.
"All four can play a variety of positions.  All four are mobile, athletic
players, all from winning programs, and they all  just love basketball," sh=
e
said.

Barnes Signs Fine Pair

Heralded point guard T.J. Ford, 5-11, 165, of Sugar Land Willowridge, and
center Chris Wright, 6-10, 235, of Redwater, signed basketball letters of
intent with Texas last Wednesday, the first day of the fall signing period.
Coach Rick Barnes said Bob Gibbons' All-Star  Report  rates Ford as the
nation's top point guard recruit and picks Wright as the No. 25 center
prospect in the country.
Ford averaged 10 points, 9 assists, 5 rebounds and 4 steals per game as a
junior in leading Willowridge to the Class 5A state title.
Wright averaged 20.6 points, 13 rebounds and 7 blocks per game as a junior.
I saw Ford play both games at the State Tournament last season and he is as
quick as any player  I have seen. He can run faster dribbling the ball than
most players can run without the ball.
He also has amazing court vision and can drill lightning-quick passes.
While he is a good shooter and can dunk the ball with ease, he appears to b=
e
much more interested in setting a teammate up with an easy basket.
"With the signing of  T.J. and Chris, we feel like we are continuing to
elevate our program," Barnes said. "We are extremely pleased, as both T.J.
and Chris are not only very talented on the basketball floor, but also
outstanding young men."
Ford is the top high school prospect in the state, according to Mike
Kunstadt's Texas Hoops. He lead his team to a 36-1 overall record and the
Class 5A state title last season.
He is tabbed the 17th-best overall prospect  in the nation by Clark Francis=
'
Hoop Scoop, the 22nd-best prospect by ESPN.com and the 28th-best prospect b=
y
Dave Telep's Rivals100.com.
"T.J. is one of the most unselfish players I have seen in all my years of
recruiting," Barnes said.  "He truly does not care if he scores a point. He
really loves distributing the basketball."
"T.J. is excellent at understanding how to manage the game on both ends of
the court," Barnes said. " Longhorn fans everywhere are going to fall in lo=
ve
with this kid."
Wright is a versatile player who can play center or forward. He was a virtu=
al
unknown until Barnes and his assistants discovered him last year, invited h=
im
for an official visit, offered him a scholarship and got a commitment.
After he committed to Texas, other schools discovered him, too, and he
started showing up on recruiting lists because he is a big guy who can run,
handle the ball and is very athletic, too.
"Chris is a guy who we really stumbled upon early," Barnes said.  "He is ve=
ry
athletic, he has a  tremendous work ethic and he has the ability to play
several positions on the floor.  I'm not sure anyone understands just how
good Chris can be."
With these two signings, Texas has no remaining scholarships to award for t=
he
current season.


Two Volleyball Aces Ink with UT

Texas volleyball coach Jim Moore has signed Austin Westlake star Bethany
Howden and club All-American LaTonya Coates of Bangor, Mich.
"We worked tremendously hard in the recruiting process this year and the
result is the signing of these two fine young ladies," Moore said.
"In terms of talent on the court, this is the best class we've signed since
I've been here," Moore said. "It continues our goal of signing volleyball
players with tremendous athleticism."
Howden is a 6-2 middle blocker who recently completed her senior season. A
three-year starter, she led the Chaps to a 101-21 combined record and
back-to-back UIL District Championships.
She led Westlake in kills (303), hitting percentage (.470) and aces (27)
while ranking second in blocks (109) this season.
She was tabbed the District 14-5A Newcomer of the year as a sophomore, and
was First Team All-District and Second Team Austin American Statesman
All-Centex honors as a junior.
On the club scene, Howden is a member of Austin Juniors and recently teamed
with current Longhorn freshman Kathy Hahn to lead the 18 Navy squad to a
perfect 15-0 record in the 2000 Tour of Texas circuit. She helped 18 Navy c=
ap
the season by finishing tops among all Texas teams (14th) at the 2000 Junio=
r
Olympics.
She also has great Longhorn bloodlines. Her father, Lynn, was an outstandin=
g
basketball player at Texas from 1969 through 1972. He is 6-6 and her mother=
,
also a UT grad, is 5-11.
"Bethany Howden not only has great athleticism and superior leaping ability=
,
but also has the makeup to step in and start right away," Moore said.
Coates is a 5-10 outside hitter. She is coached by her mother, Dorothy
Coates, at Bangor Public High School. Coates, a three-year starter on the
varsity squad, enters her senior season with her eyes on a third straight
All-State certificate from the Detroit Free Press.
On the club level, Coates has earned two All-America honors in leading USA
Michigan to a pair of National Championships, including the 2000 Under-17
crown in Louisville, Ky., for which she was named Tournament MVP.
She also made the All-Tournament Team at the 1999 Under-16 Championships in
New Orleans.
Coates also is one of Michigan's top softball pitchers, needing only 129
strikeouts to break the state record of 1,508, and has earned a pair of
All-Conference honors in basketball, having led her varsity team in scoring
and assists during both her freshman and sophomore seasons.
"La Tonya is probably the best all-around player we've had since Demetria
Sance," Moore said. "She is the complete package in that she has tremendous
leaping ability, solid natural offensive instincts and is a good ball-contr=
ol
player."

1999) and is a two-time South Hills Scholastic High Honor Roll member.
"With Osterman and the solid group of athletes we are surrounding her with,=
 I
feel we have one of the top classes nationally for next year," Clark said.
"We are pleased that we were able to recruit the offense we will need to
surround Osterman's phenomenal pitching, as we graduate five seniors at the
end of the upcoming 2001 season."
"This class, combined with this year's newcomers, provide the stability,
talent and enthusiasm we need for the future," she said.

The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful

Volume 12, No. 2, October 22, 2001

 Longhorn Defense Stifles Buffs; Simms, Benson Spark Offensive Fireworks in
41-7 Romp

The Texas defense forced four turnovers and totoally shut down Colorado's
offense in the second half to lead the No. 9 Longhorns to a 41-7 victory over
No. 14 Colorado in Austin.
The offense also had a great day, with QB Chris Simms throwing for 234 yards
and three touchdowns and true freshman RB Cedric Benson getting 100 yards for
the second straight Saturday. He also scored two touchdowns and caught three
passes for 59 yards.
Benson had the day's biggest offensive play. It came with the Longhorns
leading 17-7 and facing second-and-20 at their own 5 just before the the
half. The Horns were going into a stout wind and Colorado was threatening to
get the ball back in great field position.
But Simms dropped back and, just before he was hit, flipped a shovel pass to
Benson, who caught it, put an awesome move on two Buff defenders and sped 40
yards to launch the Longhorns on an 85-yard scoring drive that broke the game
open.
The UT defense forced four Buffalo turnovers - three fumbles and a pass
interception - and held the potent Colorado offense to just two first downs
and 45 net offensive yards in the second half.
The three fumbles Colorado lost all came in the first half and cost the Buffs
a first-and-goal at the UT 4 with Texas ahead only 7-0, and set up short
Longhorn scoring drives for the field goal that made it 10-0 and the
touchdown that gave Texas a 17-7 lead.
Colorado's starting QB, Craig Ochs, did not play because of a concussion he
suffered in the victory over Texas A&M last week. His replacement, Bobby
Pesavento, is a better passer, but Ochs is a much better runner and his
absence caused the Buffaloes to change their offensive strategy to include
more passing and less double tight end power running. The Longhorn defense
also had something to do with that.
Here, briefly, is how the game went
First Quarter
Texas won the toss and deferred. Colorado took the ball and the Longhorn
defense stuffed the Buffs' power running game and forced a quick punt.
Starting at their own 40 after a short punt into the stiff wind, the Horns
scored quickly. Benson ran for 5, then Simms hit TE Bo Scaife for 7. A wide
receiver reverse was beautifully blocked, allowing B. J. Johnson to gallop 35
yards to the Buffalo 13. Benson carried three times for a first down at the
3, then Simms, after a fake to Benson going right, rolled left and hit WR Roy
Williams for the TD. Dusty Mangum's kick gave UT a 7-0 lead with 9:09 left.
On the first play after the kickoff Pesavento hit two big passes to the UT
21. Then he threw into a crowd at the Longhorn 10, but WR Derek McCoy
wrestled it away from three Horns and bulled to the four before fumbling.
Freshman LB Derrick Johnson recovered for Texas. The Horns couldn't move and
a short punt gave the Buffs the ball at their own 48. Colorado went to its
power running game and rolled to a first down at the UT 15 before the
Longhorn defense stiffened and forced a 29-yard field goal try that was wide.
CU led in first downs, 6-4, and in total offense, 126-82, but the Longhorns
led, 7-0, because they scored on their only foray deep into Buff territory,
while the Buffaloes'  fumble at the 4 and missed chip-shot FG killed both
their scoring chances.
Second Quarter
DE Kalen Thornton forced a fumble that was recovered by UT CB Roderick Babers
at the CU 21. The Horns drove to the 4 before Mangum kicked a 21-yard field
goal for a 10-0 lead with 11:47 left. UT's kickoff into the wind went out of
bounds, giving Colorado good field position at the 35 and the Buffs got their
running game going and swept in for the TD in just seven plays to cut the
lead to 10-7 with 8:32 left. UT drove into Buff territory, but Simms was
sacked to kill the threat. The third Colorado fumble of the half set the
Horns up at the Buff 35 and they capitalized, but they they had to score two
TDs to get credit for one. First, Simms hit Williams in the end zone and
Williams got a foot down in bounds, but the official waved it off. Benson got
the TD on a 12-yard run and Mangum's kick gave UT a 17-7 lead with 3:22 left.
A quick defensive stop gave the Horns another possession at their 15 with
2:08 left. Simms was sacked at the 5 on the first play, but Benson took a
shovel pass, juked two defenders off their feet at about the 10 and scampered
40 yards down the sideline. Simms passed to WR B. J. Johnson for 22 and to
Williams for 29 before Benson scored from the 4 with 1:10 left for a 24-7
lead. Texas led in first downs, 8-4, and in total offense, 144-118 in the
quarter.
Third Quarter
Texas couldn't move into the wind and had to punt. Colorado drove to the
Texas 32 and went for it on a fourth-and-2, but the Longhorn defense held
Brown to a 1-yard gain to end that drive. The Longhorn offense then drove 69
yards in 7 plays for another TD, with the payoff coming on a 24-yard pass
from Simms to WR Sloan Thomas. Mangum's kick gave Texas a 31-7 lead with 6:47
left. The UT defense stifled Colorado's next effort and Nathan Vasher ran the
Buffalo punt back 44 yards to the CU 18, setting up a 34-yard Mangum FG for a
34-7 lead with 3:53 left. Texas led in first downs, 7-2, and in total
offense, 101-35, in the quarter.
Fourth Quarter
Simms found Thomas all alone in the end zone  for 29 yards and the game's f
inal score on the Horns' first possession in the quarter. Major Applewhite
and Chance Mock took over at QB after that. The Longhorn defense did not
allow Colorado a single first down in the period and the Buffs had only 10
plays for 10 net yards.

older to call.

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday studying the films of the Longhorns 41-7 victory
over Colorado Saturday "proved what we felt all along - our guys played
really well and really hard all day."
He also said Colorado "is a much better team than yesterday's score would
indicate. That was just a game that got out of hand because of turnovers."
He said he was very pleased with the shovel passes, wide receiver reverses
and other misdirection plays the Horns used very successfully Saturday.
"If you are moving the ball, they usually work," he said. "We've talked about
needing a little more misdirection. All of them are things we need to run
because it makes our regular plays work better."
He had said last week wanted to "use more traps, run more gaps and counter
gaps," saying it slowed defensive pursuit and created more doubt in the minds
of defenders.
After using a lot of them against the Buffaloes, he said they will remain a
part of the UT offense.
Colorado came into the game on a five-game winning streak and with a powerful
running game that ranked No. 13 nationally at 224.7 yards a game and a strong
rushing defense that was No. 15 nationally, allowing only 91.8 yards.
That had allowed the Buffs to dominate time of possession against their foes.
They were averaging about 36 minutes a game, compared to about 24 minutes for
their opponents.
But Texas dominated the time of possession, 33:33 to 26:27, held the
Buffaloes to 124 net rushing yards, 100 yards below their average, and rushed
on the Buff defenders for 161 yards, about 70 more than they had been
allowing.
Brown said the Longhorn defense did an outstanding job against the CU power
runners, and he said the Texas' offense was successful because it was able to
"stay two dimensional."
But he said the early UT lead, helped along by the Colorado turnovers,
"forced them to try to play catch-up, and playing catch-up is not their game."
"I think Colorado is really good," he said. "We've played so well at home,
and our crowd gives us a big advantage at home. I think Colorado will win a
bunch more football games this year."
Longhorn true freshman RB Cedric Benson picked up 100 yards rushing on 23
carries and scored two touchdowns in his second start.
It marked the first time all season a running back has hit the Colorado
defense for 100 yards.
"That's a credit to our balance, our offensive line and to Cedric," Brown
said. "He's a fine running back who has great vision and who almost always
falls forward. He's getting better every week."
Brown said he and his assistant coaches talk constantly to their players
about the need to show up ready to play every week, and he also said it's way
too early to worry about the BCS bowl situation "because there are a lot of
football games still to be played before that comes into play."
"We talked to our team after Florida lost to Auburn about how you can't
control anything except what you do. Anybody can beat anybody."{
"Our guys understand the only thing they can do is be the best football team
they can be and be ready to play Missouri this Saturday. What we've got to do
is try to win four more football games and see where that takes us."

Longhorn Notes, Quotes . .
They say football is a game of inches and UT QB Chris Simms will buy into
that, particularly after executiing the shovel pass to freshman RB Cedric
Benson just before the half that went for 40 yards and helped break the game
open.
"I was nervous dropping back," Simms said. "I was in the end zone and saw the
defensive  end coming, and I didn't know if our tackle got a good piece of
him, and I'm thinking, 'Gosh, I have to get it out.' Cedric's still turning
around, and I kind of threw it just as I was about to get hit and hoped he
could catch it."
"Cedric just got turned around and he caught it and then made an unbelievable
move down the sideline."
As for Benson, he says college football is a little more complicated than he
thought it would be.
"In high school, it was basically run left, run right," he said. "Here, I'm
learning how to block, how to fake better and how to run better routes."
Simms said Benson "is going to be great. He runs so hard on every play, and
the thing I like about him is every time I drop back to pass and he protects
for me, he turns around after his block and goes, 'Did I do okay?' "
"I say, 'I didn't get hit, did I?' You did okay."

Four Longhorn Substitutes Leaving Team; UT Will Sign at Least 22

Three Longhorn reserves

- sophomore CB Kendrick Turner, sophomore LB Jamal
Joyner and redshirt freshman DB Antonio Moore
- have quit the football team
and will transfer to other schools, and a fourth backup
- redshirt freshman
FB Jason Barron
- will miss the 2000 season for academic reasons.
Barron said he will work to improve his grades and return to the team, but
I
would be surprised if he comes back because he is far down on the fullback
chart and the Longhorns probably will sign at least 22 players in February.
With 80 players on scholarship and only 13 seniors, they will need to have
some more players leave next year to stay within the NCAA's 85-scholarship
limit.
None of the departures came as a surprise and Turner was the only one of
the
quartet who would have seen any meaningful action this season if he had
stayed. Joyner was on suspension. He was the last to leave of the four
players who were suspended prior to the Cotton Bowl game.
Brown wished all of the young men well, and gave the three who are
transferring unconditional releases.
* * * *
Eric Hall, 6-3, 235, 4.5, the outstanding DE prospect from Clarksville,
Tenn., told me today he is going to take his official visit to Texas the
Sept. 9 weekend and will see the season-opening game against
Louisiana-Lafayette. He said he strongly favors Texas, and the only other
schools he is considering are Nebraska and Tennessee.
"I see myself going to Texas," he said. "I was born in Texas (Fort Hood)
and
I really like the state."
Another top out-of-state DE who is strongly considering Texas is Kaelen
Jakes,  6-4, 265, 4.8 of Valencia, Cal. He lived in Texas for  four years
and
said he is considering the Horns, along with USC, UCLA, Arizona and
Nebraska.
He said his team doesn't keep invidual stats, but estimated he had "between
15
and 18 sacks last season." He said he played DE, DT and NG for Valencia
last
year.
* * * *
DT Tommie Harris of Killen Ellison is the top DL in Texas this year and is
one of the top players in the country. He says he favors Texas over Florida
State and others. Harris has been working out in Houston with a personal
trainer this summer. UT center signee Trey Bates works out with the same
trainer. Stockar McDougle, a former Oklahoma Sooner OL who now is in the
NFL,
is Harris' cousin, and is paying for the personal trainer for Harris.
* * * *
Texas has 11 early commitments, including six offensive linemen. The OLs
are
Mike Garcia of Galena Park (who switched from A&M to Texas), Jonathan Scott
of Dallas Carter, Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village, Roman Reeves of
Livingston, Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls and Alfio Randall of Blinn
JC.
Scott and Robinson are national top 100 players and Randall was a top 100
player at Houston Yates two years ago. The other pledges are QB/DB Kendal
Briles of Frenship, MLB Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison, and DBs Cedric
Griffin of San Antonio Holmes, Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity and Brian
Carter of The Woodlands.
Ten players who signed with Texas are slated to play in the annual
North-South High School Football All-Star game at Rice Stadium next Tuesday
at 7 p.m. Scheduled to play for the North are QBs Chance Mock of The
Woodlands and Tony Jeffery of Klein Forest, WRs Roy Williams of Odessa
Permian, B. J. Johnson of South Grand Prairie and Nathan Vasher of
Texarkana
and kicker Matt McFadden of Coppell.
Scheduled to play for the South are OT Lionel Garr of Diboll, C Trey Bates
of
Fort Bend Elkins and DTs Sonny Davis of Austin Lanier and Marcel Moses of
Texas City. Davis and Moses failed to qualify academically and are headed
to
the JC ranks. Johnson has a sprained ankle that will keep him out of the
game.
* * * *
FOOTBALL NOTES: The Longhorn DBs are extremely impressed with Sloan Thomas
and Tony Jeffery, who are two of the outstanding incoming freshman wide
receiver prospects. They said Thomas is a big, physical receiver with great
speed, and they say Jeffery is very hard to cover because he has such great
moves and quickness. The players have been working out against each other
during voluntary summer drills.
* * * *
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL RECRUITING: CoCo Reed, a 5-11 forward from Houston
Jersey
Village, has committed to play for the Texas women. She averaged 19 points
as
a junior and averaged 23 points in AAU play this summer. She lives with 5-6
junior point guard Nina Norman, who will be one of the nation's top
prospects
next year. Reed also was recruited by Duke, LSU, Rutgers, Florida and
Maryland, among others.
The Longhorn women's top incoming freshmen
- 6-1 Stacy Stephens of Winnsboro
and 6-2 Annissa Hastings of San Antonio Sam Houston
- were named to the AAU
All-American Team Saturday at the conclusion of the National AAU Tournament
in Clarksville, Tenn.

Texas Women Sign Center

UT women's basketball coach Jody Conradt already had a lot of tall recruits
in her nationally ranked recruiting class, but she didn't have a true cente=
r
until last week when she won a long battle to sign 6-2 Spring Westfield
center Mercedes Williams.
Williams averaged 16 points, 7.8 rebounds and 3.7 steals per game in leadin=
g
Westfield to a 33-3 record and a berth in the state Class 5A finals.
She was on the All-State team and was the Houston Chronicle's Player of the
Year.
She is a strong physical presence in the paint and relishes the tough play
around the basket. She will provide much needed depth behind Stacy Stephens
and Annissa Hastings at center for the Longhorns.
"With the addition of Mercedes, we now have five newcomers who immediately
raise the overall talent level of our program," Conradt said, adding that a=
ll
five players "are considered among the very best players coming out of thei=
r
respective states."
The other four signees are:
* 6-2 forward Kala Bowers of Woodward, Okla., the Oklahoma Player of the Ye=
ar
* 6-2 Heather Schreiber of Windthorst,  the top player in Texas and a Parad=
e
All-American
* 5-11 guard-forward Coco Reed of Houston Jersey Village
* Canadian Junior National team player Jody Bell, a 6-2 forward from
Chestermere High School  in Alberta.
The Longhorns had a top 10 recruiting class nationally before signing
Williams.

Women's Tennis in Sweet 16

The No. 13-ranked Texas women's tennis team beat No. 19 TCU, 4-1, Sunday in
Austin in the second round of the NCAA regional playoffs.
Texas, 21-8, advances to the NCAA round of 16 and will play No. 2 Duke
Thursday in Stone Mountain, Ga.
The Longhorns played Duke earlier this season, losing 4-3 in Austin.
TCU finished 21-4.

Men's Tennis Team Falls to LSU

The No. 22-ranked Longhorn men's tennis team fell to LSU, 4-2, Sunday in
Baton Rouge in the second round of the NCAA playoffs.
The Longhorns end the season 18-6, while LSU advances to the Round of 16.

Longhorn Golfers in Regional

The No. 5-ranked Longhorn golf team will compete in the NCAA Central Region=
al
Championships in Stillwater Oklahoma Thursday through Saturday.
Texas finished third in the Maxwell Invitational in Ardmore, Okla., last
weekend, shooting a 16-over par 853 to finish five strokes behind tourney
champ Tulsa.

UT Basketball Recruits Honored

Texas basketball coach Rick Barnes' two recruits both ranked among the
nation's elite players at their positions.
Good national basketball ratings are hard to find, but Student Sports
Magazine recently came out with a ranking of the top 25 players at each
position for a national top 125 overall.
Point guard T. J. Ford, 5-11, of Fort Bend Willowridge, ranked No. 8 at his
position and 6-10 center Chris Wright of Redwater ranked No. 25 among the b=
ig
guys in the middle.
Most rating services had Ford much higher, but it is a great tribute to
Wright's potential that he made the list of the top 25 centers because he
missed almost all of his senior year with a torn ACL that required surgery.
Ford's 39-0 Willowridge team also was ranked No. 2 in the nation by Student
Sports, and the Eagles were the top-ranked public school team.
Mouth of Wilson, Va., which gives scholarships and recruits all over the
nation, was ranked No. 1, but the Warriors are an all-star team with player=
s
from several states and countries.
Ford also made the magazine's 10-man first team senior All-American list,
which was surprising since he was rated only No. 8 in the point-guard
category.
I suppose they have two gurus with different views of the point guards. I g=
o
along with the one who rated Ford as one of the top two point guards becaus=
e
every other rating service I saw had him as one of the top two or three poi=
nt
guards in the nation.

Evans Testing Pro Waters

Junior Longhorns swingman Maurice Evans, 6-5, 220, has declared himself
eligible for June 27 NBA draft.
Evans, who led the Horns in scoring last year with a 15.6 average, has not
hired an agent and can return to Texas for his senior season if he doesn't
elect to turn pro.
While Evans is a fine college player, he lacks great dribbling skills at th=
is
point and probably won't be drafted. He could benefit from another year und=
er
coach Rick Barnes' tutelage.

Horns Recruiting Top JC Guard

The Longhorns are in the running for a top junior college combo guard.
Terrell Ross, 6-4, a point guard with fine shooting skills at Allegany JC i=
n=20
Meadville, Md, visited UT three weeks ago and has narrowed his picks to
Texas, Mississippi State and Michigan State.
Tuesday is the deadline for signing letters of intent in basketball, so he
will sign with someone right away or his recruiting will drag on until he
shows up on a college campus to start classes.
He led Allegany to a 31-3 record and the National JC championship game.
He averaged only 8.9 points a game for a loaded team that features four oth=
er
Division I signees, but he hit 60% of his shots from the field and 74.3% of
his free throws. He also is an outstanding defensive player and rebounder.

An All-American and Southwest Conference  diving champion in 1940 for the
Longhorns, Chapman returned as the program's head coach in 1951 and guided =
UT
to three SWC titles and 15 runner-up conference finishes over his 20-year
tenure.
A native of California, Chapman also served for several years on the NCAA
Swimming Rules Committee and was named the Team USA diving coach for the 19=
64
Olympic games in Tokyo - which he did not attend due to a heart ailment.
Among his pupils, which included 23 All-Americans and 78 individual
conference champions, was the late David "Skippy" Browning, who was a
three-time SWC diving champion and two-time NCAA Champion on both the
one-meter and three-meter boards, and also became the Longhorns' first
Olympian diver and gold medalist during the 1952 Olympic Games in Helsinki.

Texas women's swimming co-head coaches Jill Sterkel and Mike Walker have
signed seven top prospects. Two transfers also are joining the team.

class accomplishes each of these goals and also gives us even more. They ar=
e
great swimmers who have wonderful attitudes and strong work ethics."

from a friend in Austin....
The uncut version.

i went to both the am and the pm practices yesterday, and let me
re-re-re-iterate that we have a great group of receivers and that the stud
dog bad ass mofo of the group is roy williams.  he is physically way beyond
not only vasher and the walkon CBs trying to cover him, but the rest of the
college ranks.  ahmad brooks was standing by him in street clothes, and
there ain't a chance he could stop roy.  roy flies past people and gets way
the fuck up there and takes the ball out of the clouds.  he's a fucking
randy moss, but you know what?  he's bigger than randy moss and as fast as
randy moss and probably has as good a vertical as randy moss:

Moss
height: 6'4"
weight:  198 lbs.
40 speed: 4.3
vertical: ?

Roy
height: 6'5"
weight: 210 lbs.
40 speed: 4.3
100 speed: 10.38
high jump: 6'10"
long jump: 24'

we may just have the next superhuman WR on our team.  pray for no injuries.
i'm going to the pm practice today, too.  got a hard-on just thinking about
roy.  probably will see a few NFL GMs there.

and the other WRs are spectacular, too.  sloan is 6'2" and does well at
establishing and holding position vs. the cover man.  BJ is 6'1" and has
really soft hands.  i watched BJ, vasher and jeffrey field 12-15 punts each
at 60 yds with a cross wind in the pm session.  vasher and jeffrey had
technical problems and bobbled or dropped almost half.  BJ never bobbled or
dropped one.  as soon as it's close, he just sucks it in and takes off.  and
that's how he catches balls on the crossing routes.  vacuum hands.

it's going to be unfuckingreal a year or two down the road when these guys
have experience and simms gets to throw to them on the field three at a
time.  you can't doubleteam them all.

put simply, i think the days of our using white 5'7" WRs are over.

Inside Texas Fax Service    Vol. 7, No. 12 Monday, Aug. 28, 2000

Insidetx, Inc, 2900 W. Anderson 20-194, Austin TX 78757, $85.50 for 110
faxes ($69 by email), 512-249-8916, http://www.InsideTexas.com

It's hard to remember a running back in the state of Texas who has entered
his senior season with more incredible publicity than Midland Lee's Cedric
Benson, who committed to Texas Thursday night, ending months of sometimes
frenzied speculation about his plans and the plans of the Texas coaching
staff with regard to him. Just as an example, he's on the cover of Dave
Campbell's all by himself, a first for a high-schooler in the 41 year
history of that venerable magazine, and he's got high school coaches
showering him with praise, some calling him the best high school running
back they've ever seen. Which is why after talking to him I came away so
impressed by his maturity and seeming level-headedness about the whole
thing. He answered my questions in a thoughtful and articulate manner and
seemed pretty unfazed by the hype. This is a young man who cares as much
about his performance in the classroom as on the field, and he appears to
be doing a helluva job in both. In short, Benson looks like exactly the
type of player and person with whom Mack Brown wants to build his program.
I caught up with Cedric last Saturday afternoon, after his Lee team had
traveled 12 hours round-trip by bus to El Paso for a Friday scrimmage.

So what was it about the Longhorns that made you decide to finally commit
to them?

Benson: They're doing a great job of recruiting, both offensively and
defensively. They've recruited great quarterbacks and receivers so I feel
like all they need is a great running back and we'll be pretty balanced.
Here at Lee, that's how we've been the last couple of years which has
enabled us to win state championships, and I feel like with a balanced
offense, nobody will be able to stop us.

Were you keeping up with the job Texas has been doing recruiting offensive
lineman this summer, and did that play any role in your decision?

Benson: Yeah, definitely.

Obviously you've been the subject of a huge amount of publicity what with
being on the cover of Dave Campbell's and having various high school
coaches calling you the best high school back they've ever seen. How have
you reacted to that?

Benson: I take it as a big compliment, when you get coaches at a high level
saying that you are a great athlete, it's just a great compliment, but it's
my job not to let it go to my head. I've still got a lot of work to do here
at Lee, both school-wise and football-wise before I go off to school.

Speaking of Lee -- back to back state titles, that's amazing. Do you think
you've got a team this season that can make it a three-peat?

Benson: Yeah, with a lot of dedication and hard work, we can do it again.

Do you have any personal goals for yourself this season?

Benson: My main goal is just to win, and I want to make straight A's, I've
been thinking about that a lot.

So you don't get too caught up in the rushing titles and the touchdown
records and so forth?

Benson: No, because those come along with winning, you know? If I get out
there and work real hard and the team works real hard and we win, then I
will maybe come out of the game with 150 yards or 200 yards rushing and
three or four touchdowns, so that just comes along with winning.

How would you describe your running style, what are you're strengths?

Benson: I don't really think I could compare myself to anybody else. I'm a
pretty balanced act: I can run, my strength is good, I can catch, and I
have good vision.

Are you featured much out of the backfield at Lee?

Benson: Yeah, we do a lot of roll-out passes and a lot of screen passes.

So have the Texas coaches talked to you about how they see you fitting into
their offensive scheme?

Benson: No, not really, and I didn't really question them about it, either,
because I'm pretty sure they are focused on what they've gotta do right
now, but we'll talk more about football later.

What are your physical numbers right now?

Benson: I'm probably around 5-11, 6-0 right now and about 198 pounds. I run
a 4.3 on the track and a 4.4 on grass.

So you are done with recruiting and are solid for Texas?

Benson: Yeah I am. I'm glad to get it all over with and just be a kid again
for my last year.

Finally, is there anything you'd like to tell the Texas fans out there
about yourself as you head into your senior season and beyond that at UT?

Benson: I just want them to know they'll be getting a great guy and a hard
football player. Pearle

Practice notes: After a lackluster scrimmage performance Saturday at DKR,
the Texas offense returned to the field Monday morning with a renewed
vigor. For probably the first time all fall, the offensive players made
more noise than their defensive counterparts, hooting and hollering after
every big offensive play. Brett Robin and B.J. Johnson provided the biggest
scream-inducing plays, Robin with a barreling draw play run that left Greg
Brown flat on his back and Johnson with a catch-and-run TD from Major where
he out-leapt and then out-ran defender Nathan Vasher. "After reevaluating
the scrimmage and our staff meeting yesterday, we felt like that there was
more intensity on defense than there was on offense," Mack Brown said. "The
offense, though, came out today and fought back and had some intensity." .
. . Carl Reese said after practice that he expects Kalen Thornton to see
action at RDE in the opener vs. Louisiana-Lafayette. The D-coordinator said
he's pleased with the play of Jermain Anderson as the starter at the
position but the coaches plan to keep him fresh (which Reese says keeps him
effective) by rotating players in, including Cole Pittman and Thornton. . .
. Speaking of Pittman, he saw a lot of work today at LDE because Cory
Redding sat out with a sore knee and sore shoulder. Brown said Redding
would miss Wednesday's final scrimmage and possibly return for Thursday's
workout. Derrick Dockery has an infected cyst on, as Brown put it, "his
rear end" and missed Monday's workouts. The coach said Dockery is running a
fever and is feeling very sick and probably won't be back until next week.
Tillman Holloway took the first-team snaps at LG in Dockery's place. Ervis
Hill did not practice again today because of his sore knee. The Texas
doctors believe there is not any serious damage to the knee, but he will
miss the scrimmage Wednesday before possibly returning Thursday. Courtnee
Garcia (hamstring pull) participated in pass drills for the first time
since last week, but still didn't practice full speed. Ross

from the state's best offensive lineman, Jonathan Scott, 6-7, 295, 4.9, of
Dallas Carter, and another top o-line prospect in Will Allen, 6-5, 280, 5.2=
,
of Houston Cypress Falls.
Scott is on all the  national top 100 lists and turned down offers from 17
other schools such as Florida State, Michigan and Tennessee  to pick the
Longhorns.
Scott's father, Ray, a former tight end with the New York Jets, said
Jonathan
"was very impressed with coach Brown and all the coaches and he told me he
felt like the players were just one big family."
Scott also said his son "wants to get a degree from Texas because he wants
to
live in Texas after he graduates."
Scott committed last Wednesday at the conclusion of UT's first full 3 1/2
day
summer camp. It was the third straight summer he came to a Texas camp. "I
just like everything about Texas," Scott said, adding that the coaches told
him they want to work him at the key left tackle spot.
Allen, who already had scholarship offers from Arkansas, Duke, Tulsa and
South Carolina, also committed at the camp Wednesday, but didn't make it
public until Thursday.
He has been a starter since his sophomore year.
Allen said he came to the camp hoping to get a scholarship offer and was
eager to accept it when it was offered.
"I knew this was where I wanted to go if the opportunity presented itself,"
he said. "I like all the coaches and players at Texas, and the facilities
are
great. I feel like I can get a great education at Texas and just feel reall=
y
comfortable with my decision to commit early."
Allen had taken unofficial visits to Texas, Texas A&M, Notre Dame, LSU and
Baylor prior to coming to the Texas camp, and he said, "Texas has great
facilities, it's one of the top academic schools and it has an outstanding
football program with great coaches and kids. I just felt like it fit in
better here than anywhere else."
Both Scott and Allen are honor students who already are full qualifiers.
Another UT camp is underway right now, and there is good chance the
Longhorns
will get some more early commitments within the next several days.
Shane Simms of Tomball, another of the state's top offensive line prospects=
,
is attending this week's camp, and he wants to come to Texas, so he is
likely
to commit if he gets an offer.
The Longhorns have zeroed in on two nationally recruited quarterbacks =01) =
Matt
Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch and Bret Rawls of Shreveport Evangel =01) a=
nd
offered scholarships to each of them when they attended UT camps last week.
Both are 6-5, and both are strong-armed passers with good mobility. Rawls
weighs about 200 pounds and Nordgren weighs 225.
The Longhorns will sign at least one quarterback, and it is hard to get two
top ones in the same class, so they probably are ready to take a commit fro=
m
either Nordgren or Rawls and call it quits on quarterback recruiting this
year.
Nordgren, who had been looking primarily at Stanford and other out-of-state
schools, said he is still wide open, but he said Texas and Texas A&M have
moved to the top of his list right now.
Asked if there is a leader, he said, "I'm still pretty open, but I like the
two big Texas schools. They both have outstanding coaching staffs."
He said the Longhorn coaches "told me I was the No. 1 quarterback for them
in
the state. I had an hour meeting with the coaches when I got there, and the=
n
I had another meeting with coach Brown after the camp was over."
The Longhorns also appear to be homing in on an in-state running back, and
he
is Anthony Johnson, a 5-11, 196-pounder with 4.4 speed from Jefferson.
Johnson told me he was coming to Austin last Saturday to talk to the UT
coaches. He said they had invited him to come for an unofficial visit.
On tape, the thing that is most impressive about him is his speed at the
point of attack. He gets through a hole as quickly as anyone I have seen
this
year. He has a great combination of speed and power and he should be a
210-pounder after a year on a good college weight program.
The Longhorns probably will sign about 20 recruits, and 10 or 11 of them
will
be linemen if the coaches can get the ones they want.
Texas loaded up on speedy skill players in the last class, but this class
will be a true class of beef, with six or seven offensive linemn and four o=
r
five defensive linemen if things break right.
If linemen do get 10 or 11 of the scholarships, look for the Horns to take
one quarterback, one or two running backs, one tight end, one or two wide
receivers, one or two linebackers and two or three defensive backs.
We've already looked at the quarterback situation and the in-state running
back picture. There are several out-of-state blue-chip running backs who ar=
e
interested in Texas, but they are long shots.
One of the running backs might be a fullback if the Horns can sign a great
one like 6-2, 240-pound James Buchanan of Sarasota, Fla. He says he might
visit Texas, but FSU is the leader right now, so he is a long shot for the
Longhorns.
The tight end Texas is after is James Moses, 6-3, 225, 4.7, of Galena Park
North Shore. He is the best one in Texas and one of the best in the nation.
He told me he might come to a Texas camp, and he said he likes the Longhorn=
s
and the way they use their tight end.
The Longhorns are recruiting at least six wide receivers to try to fill two
spots. They are Armon Dorrough of Lancaster, Brandon Jones of Liberty-Eylau=
,
Bennie Brazell of Houston Westbury, Thomson Omboga of Grand Prairie, Keith
Mills of Garland and Lynzell Jackson of Union HS in Tempe, Arizona.
All of them are speedsters and all of them have some interest in Texas. The
Longhorns loaded up on wide receivers last year, but they have two senior
wide receivers and would like to sign two recruits to replace them.
Derrick Johnson of Waco is the linebacker of choice for Texas and everyone
else. He is a great prospect with size and speed. He came to the Texas
mini-camp last week, and he says the Longhorns are slightly ahead of Florid=
a
State and Texas A&M.
Jonathon Jackson of Galena Park North Shore is another linebacker who is
rising on the charts. He is supposed to come to one of the Texas camps, and
he likes Texas and Penn State.
If the Longhorns can get Johnson and Jackson, they will have hit it big at
linebacker.
In the defensive backfield, safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple is the main
man.
He's 6-3, weighs 198 and he ran a 4.46 40 at the Austin Nike camp.
He likes Texas, but Nebraska and Florida State are in the hunt, too, along
with Texas A&M.
Texas wants to sign two cornerbacks, and there are some very good ones who
are interested, including Moses Harris of Dallas Carter, Cedric Griffin of
San Antonio Holmes, Dee Durham of Mansfield and Roger Ross of Denver
Jefferson.
That brings us back to the lines. There are more really top-notch offensive
linemen in Texas than I have seen since in the 10 years I have been doing
this, and, luckily for the Longhorns, that is their area of greatest need.
Texas has had depth problems in the offensive linemen ever since Brown and
his staff arrived. This is the year they should be able to sign as many top
prospects as they need.
With Scott and Allen already committed, there are four or five spots still
open.
One of those will be filled by Alfio Randall, if he graduates from Blinn JC
and becomes academically eligible. He signed with Texas out of Houston
Yates,
but failed to qualify and went to Blinn. He is on track to graduate in
December and he says he will enroll in Texas in January.
Another possibility is Greg Barnum, a former Killeen Ellison star who was
being boomed for All-America honors as a sophomore center at Tennessee
before
he abruptly quit the team last month, citing homesickness.
But Phil Fulmer, the Tennessee coach, won't grant Barnum a release to atten=
d
a Division I school. That means he will have to pay his own way during the
year he is sitting out at his new school =01) if he picks another Division =
I
school.
If he picks Stephen F. Austin, where his former coach at Killeen Ellison no=
w
coaches, he can go on scholarship immediately.
I talked to Barnum Sunday night and he said he was going to drive to Austin
Monday "to just look around at UT. I know the coaches can't talk to me
(because he doesn't have a release), but I just want to come over there and
look around."
He said he has already visited Stephen F. Austin and probably will make up
his mind later this month about the course he will take.
"I'd like to go a big state school, but I'd also like to have a scholarship
right away," Barnum said. "I can't get a release from Tennessee, so I'll
have
to decide what I want to do."
He said he will try to get some student loans and grants if he enrolls at U=
T
as a non-scholarship student for the first year.
Under NCAA rules, he will have to sit out a transfer year at his new school=
,
then will have three years of eligibility remaining.
Other offensive line prospects Texas is recruiting include Simms, Abe
Robinson of Houston Jersey Village and Roman Reeves of Livingston (who all
came to UT camps this summer), plus Jami Hightower of Jacksonville, Ben
Wilkerson of Hemphill and William Winston of Houston Madison.
Hightower, Wilkerson and Robinson join Scott on many of the national top 10=
0
lists.
Texas has a good shot at all of the offensive linemen I mentioned except
Wilkerson, and the Horns are on his radar screen now after being absent
throughout the year.
The supply of offensive linemen is so plentiful that I think the UT coaches
can sign five, six or seven very good ones, depending on how many they thin=
k
they need.
The picture isn't as rosy on the defensive side of the ball. DT Tommie
Harris
of Killeen Ellison is a great prospect, and DT Thomas Derricks of Dallas
Jesuit is very good. Harris is strongly considering Texas, but Derricks has
no interest in the Longhorns at this point.
They are the only sure-fire top tackles I have found in the state at this
point.
There are some big ends who might grow into tackles. For example, Simeon
Jones of Houston Jones is 6-3 and 240, but he has just turned 16, too. He's
a
year younger than most of the guys being recruited, so he might get a lot
bigger.
There also are some out-of-state tackles who have a little interest in
Texas,
including Marcus Spears, 6-5, 275, 4.8, of Baton Rouge Southern Lab, and
Marquise Hill, 6-7, 280, 4.9, of New Orleans DeLaSalle.
Some other tackles who could emerge as seniors include Sharod McGowan of
Waco
and Jeremy Calahan of Pflugerville. They both looked great at times as
juniors and could become top prospects with more consistent performances as
seniors.
The picture is brighter at end. Kevin Everett of Port Arthur Jefferson,
Jones, McKenzie Tilmon of Irving MacArthur, Jamie Jackson of Andrews and
Colin Allred of Dallas Hillcrest are very good in-state prospects, and the
Horns are in on two out-of-state DEs who were born in Texas  =01) Eric Hall=
,
6-3, 232, 4.5, of Clarksville, Tenn., and Kaelen Jakes, 6-4, 240, 4.75, of
Valencia, Cal.

Longhorns Fifth in NCAA Golf

The young Longhorn men's golf team finished in fifth place at the NCAA
Championships in Opelika, Ala.
Texas started the final round in second place just three shots off the lead=
,
the Longhorns finished with a four-day total of 1125 (-27).
Oklahoma State captured the national team title after defeating Georgia Tec=
h
on the first hole of a playoff. Both OSU and Georgia Tech posted four-round
scores of 1116 (-36), breaking the NCAA Championship record for team score.
Arizona recorded a final-round 274 (-14) to place third at 1118, while
Houston registered a final-round 272 (-16) to finish in fourth place at
1122.
After scoring just one over-par round in the first three days of the
tournament, Texas was forced to count three over-par scores on the final
day.
Sophomore David Gossett posted a four-over-par 76 in the final round to sli=
p
into a tie for third place in the individual standings. Gossett posted a
four-day total of 275 (-13).
Freshman J.J. Wall tied for 20th at 283 (-5). Sophomore John Klauk  tied fo=
r
34th at 286 (-2). Sophomore Matt Brost tied for 53rd at 291 (+3). Sophomore
Russell Surber  finished in a tie for 68th at 295 (+7).
"I'm really proud of our effort as a team," said third-year head coach John
Fields. "Although we did not play at the same level which we did during the
first three days, placing fifth in the nation with four sophomores and one
freshman is a great achievement for our program."
The fifth-place showing marked the best performance by Texas since the Horn=
s
placed third in 1995. It also marked the best performance by a
Fields-coached
squad, as his New Mexico team tied for sixth in 1996.

Women 3rd in NCAA Golf

The Texas women's golf team finished third at the NCAA Championships in
Sunriver, Oregon.
The Longhorns, who finished ninth in last year's NCAA Championships,
finished
two strokes behind second place Stanford (301-298-297-300=3D1196, +44) and =
23
shots behind first place Arizona (299-285-281-310=3D1175, +23).
The third-place showing is Texas' best finish at the NCAAs since Kelli
Kuehne
led UT to a third-place mark in 1996. It is UT's 11th overall and third
straight top-10 finish at the NCAA Championships, dating back to 1982.
"I'm so proud of this team," said Texas head coach Susan Watkins.
"We put forth a lot of effort today and everyone on the team made an impact
over the last four days," Watkins said. "I can't ask for anything more from
this team."
"We accomplished our goal that we set at the beginning of the season, which
was to finish in the top five at the NCAA Championships."
"Our hard work paid off in the end and I'm pleased that I was able to coach
this group of players all year long," Watkins said. "Everyone did a
wonderful
job."
Sophomore Kristin Dufour was Texas' top finisher at the NCAAs, posting a
72-hole score of 13-over par 301 (74-77-73-77) to tie for 25th place
overall.
Freshman Jessica Reese finished with a 14-over par 302 (75-78-75-74) to tie
for 29th place, while sophomore Randi Meadows tied for 34th at 15-over par
(74-76-71-82=3D303).
"Our hard work paid off in the end and I'm pleased that I was able to coach

Juniors Suzanne Sowers  and Laura Blessey rounded out Texas' play with
scores
of 16-over par 304 (73-83-72-76) and 21-over par 309 (78-77-78-76) to tie
for
41st and 68th place.
Arizona's Jenna Daniels won the individual crown with a one-under par 287.

Football Notes . .

Leonard Davis, UT's outstanding offensive tackle, suffered an ankle injury
last week. It is believed to be a sprain.
Further tests will be conducted this week. If it is a sprain, he should be
able to recover in time for the start of football practice in early July. I=
f
the injury turns out to be more severe, it could cause him to miss some of
the pre-season practices.
* * * *
The off-season conditioning workouts are going great and some of the
offensive linemen appear to be dropping some pounds.
Junior Mike Williams and senior Cory Quye, the two veterans who will battle
for the right tackle slot, both look more fit than I have ever seen them.
Williams still needs to drop a few more pounds so he can have the quickness
to pick up speedy outside pass rushers, but he is making progress. Quye
looks
like he is ready to start the season right now.
* * * *
Most of the key incoming freshmen are in Austin for the summer.
QB Chance Mock arrived last weekend and he looks like he has been following
strength and conditioning mentor Mad Dog Madden's recommendations.
He appears to be about 6-2 210 or 215 pounds. He looks like he could play
linebacker. That's what happened to his dad, Mike, a great QB prospect from
Longview more than 25 years ago.
Mike signed with Texas Tech and was moved to linebacker, where he starred a=
t
Tech and earned some playing time in the NFL
But that won't happen with Chance Mock. He is a Michael Vick-type
quarterback, with a great arm, quick feet and a sturdy body.
And even if he could play linebacker, the Longhorns don't have enough bodie=
s
at quarterback to even give that a thought.

LA TIMES HAS UT #1 AND ON THE CUSP OF ANOTHER DYNASTY

Big Talent and Soft Schedule Have Him Hooked on 'Horns
CHRIS DUFRESNE , Times Staff Writer
AUSTIN, Texas -- They haven't cleared ground yet for the presidential
helipad, but it's starting to feel a bit like the days when coach Darrell K.
Royal roamed the sidelines and Lyndon Baines Johnson literally dropped into
Texas Memorial Stadium.
"We always knew when he was coming, because we could hear the helicopter,"
Royal says of LBJ. "The Texas band would play 'Hail to the Chief.' He loved
that."
At 76, Royal can't shoot his age anymore, but he still shoots a pretty good
breeze.
He is standing next to his cart at the Barton Creek Golf Club, regaling
visitors with tall Texas tales.
"When we were really jelly-rolling it, it was an exciting time," Royal says.

Then, like time, Texas football slipped away.
It has been 24 years since Royal retired and 30 years since he coached the
last of three national championship teams in 1970.
Royal didn't figure to last long enough to see the revival, let alone be a
part of it.
But after a quarter-century of being a football plain state, Texas has gone
retro.
Royal has been summoned back from the pasture he had been put out to, Texan
George W. Bush is 272 electoral votes short of reclaiming the White House,
and Longhorn football may be on the cusp of another dynasty.
Pay no mind to the Associated Press' preseason poll or the coaches' annual
weather-vane tally.
Texas is No. 1.
Yeah, we know--Texas Coach Mack Brown can't believe it either.
"We're in the top 10 in most polls and we lost our last three games?" Brown
says.
Don't bother us with details, Mack, it's time to toot your Longhorns.
We say this knowing Texas may actually be a year away. There are holes to
fill at wide receiver and a quarterback controversy brewing between Major
Applewhite and Chris Simms.
But, cosmically, this is the year Bush and Texas can go over the top
together.
The Longhorns have 18 starters returning from last year's 9-5 team and are
still sock-sorting through three of the best recruiting loads in history.
In two years, Brown has shaken Texas football to its core, not to mention
just about every hand in the state.
The schedule is softer than those box springs over in Sealy. In a
controversial move, Texas backed out of a season-opening game at
much-improved Hawaii and instead will play host to Louisiana Lafayette.
Texas also misses Kansas State and Nebraska in Big 12 Conference play, faces
upstart Oklahoma in Dallas on Oct. 7 and gets archrival Texas A&M on Nov. 24
in Austin.
If the Longhorns can sidestep a couple of potholes--at Stanford on Sept. 16,
at Colorado on Oct. 14--they could be 11-0 headed into a potential Dec. 2
Big 12 title game showdown against powerhouse Nebraska.
Brown faced a similar scenario three years ago at North Carolina, when his
Tar Heels needed only a home victory against Florida State to reach the
title game.
"We had everything there except we weren't ready to win the game," Brown
says.
Florida State scorched the Tar Heels at Chapel Hill and North Carolina
finished 11-1, No. 4 in the final coaches' poll.
The difference this time is that Texas may be the one team not intimidated
by Nebraska. The Longhorns handed the Cornhuskers their only loss last year
and thumped Nebraska two years ago in Lincoln.
In the 1996 Big 12 title game, of course, John Mackovic's Texas team stunned
No. 3 Nebraska, 37-27, in one of the decade's greatest games.
"Our kids like that game," Brown says. "They respect them, but are not
intimidated. They want to be in that game." So what happened, Bevo?
There is no good excuse for Texas football ever going sour.
It's like Napa Valley not being able to produce grapes.
Texas has been a football hotbed for 100 years. It is the state's collegiate
football program, with unparalleled interest, talent and funding.
Fred Akers, who succeeded Royal, had his moments but never seemed to get the
right bounce. A heart-wrenching, 10-9 Cotton Bowl loss to Georgia in the
1983 season-ender cost Texas the national title.
Then came the Texas flu-step.
Texas went 36-34-1 from 1984 through 1989 under Akers and David McWilliams,
and 41-28-2 in six years under Mackovic in the 1990s.
Texas hasn't been ranked No. 1 in the AP since Oct. 9, 1984.
Bill Little, an athletic department publicity man since 1965, has witnessed
first-hand the fall from grace.
"'Anger is one thing," Little says, "but when it was apathy, that's when I
thought we'd never get it back."
Some blame the decline on rampant cheating that pervaded the Southwest
Conference in the 1980s (Texas emerged relatively unscathed).
"We were in a world then when people played by a different set of rules,"
DeLoss Dodds, the school's athletic director since 1981, says. "We just
weren't getting the players. And we let our facilities slip."
Though he turned out to be the wrong coach, Mackovic at least deserves
credit for spearheading a five-year, $90-million makeover that has left
Texas with jaw-dropping facilities.
Something else was missing all those years, though.
Someone, actually.
Darrell Royal.
For reasons that remain clouded, Texas pushed Royal aside in 1976--he was
not even allowed on the search committee that led to Akers' hiring.
What did Royal contribute? In 20 years, his Texas teams won 11 SWC titles
and national championships in 1963, 1969 and 1970.
In 1968, he and his staff developed the "Wishbone" offense, a
quadruple-threat run offense that propelled Texas to 30 wins in a row and
consecutive national titles.
It was Royal who, one summer, taught the Wishbone to Alabama's Bear Bryant.
But an old cowboy was allowed to fade into the sunset.
"I really don't like to talk about what happened in between," Royal says of
the dark years. "I'd rather stay current. It might not come out right." It
didn't take Brown long to turn over tables.
One of his first acts after replacing Mackovic in 1997 was restoring Royal
to the royal court.
During an early Texas practice in the Brown regime, Royal asked the new
coach if it was OK to talk to one of his players.
"I said, 'Yeah, you can talk to him,' " Brown says. " 'The stadium's named
after you, you can do whatever you want.' "
Brown, in turn, extracted from Royal the nuances and politics of Texas
football.
When Brown asked, "Will you help me with the Texas tradition?" the old
coach's face turned a Royal flush.
"I knew we had something special then," Royal says. "He knew where his
priorities were."
Royal told Brown to keep his nose out of state politics.
He instructed Brown about dealing with Texas fans: "Whether you like it or
not, they need to think you like it."
He told Brown that Texas was like no other football creature.
"The good news is people really care at Texas," Royal told Brown. "The bad
news is that people really care about Texas."
Royal won't forget Brown's entrance on the Texas stage.
Before addressing the media at his introductory news conference, Brown
stopped in the hallway and called Eddie Joseph, executive vice president of
the state's High School Coaches' Assn.
"In a sense, that was more the nuts and bolts of the football program rather
than the press conference," Royal says.
Brown has since thrown up a recruiting wall around Texas. He has either
visited or written all 1,200 of Texas' prep coaches.
"He's absolutely the best P.R. guy I've ever run across," Royal says.
This year, Brown turned down 700 speaking engagements and transformed the
school's football athletic complex into a monument to Texas football.
Instead of Muzak, athletic department elevators chime "The Eyes of Texas Are
Upon You," the school's fabled fight song.
Former Texas Heisman trophy winner Earl Campbell watches home games seated
in one of six real saddles perched in the players' private lounge in Texas
Memorial Stadium.
Mack's idea.
Texas has sold 50,000 season tickets this year, despite not playing
Oklahoma, Kansas State or Nebraska at home.
"It's coming, it's around the corner," DeLoss says of Texas' return to
glory. "And it's the real thing." There's nothing like a quarterback
controversy to screw up a potential dynasty.
In Austin, it's the talk of Sixth Street's rooftop eateries.
Applewhite or Simms? Simms or Applewhite?
"I was in a gas station," Simms said, "And I go to pay the guy and he says,
'You're that Simms kid, right? You going to beat out Applewhite?' "
Hey, what better place than a gas station to pump for information?
Simms, the sophomore son of former New York Giant quarterback Phil Simms, is
Texas' most heralded recruit since Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams.
The 1998 USA Today high school player of the year, Simms reneged on a
commitment to Tennessee and instead chose Texas.
Simms says Tennessee wanted to redshirt him; he wanted to play right away.
But as a true freshman last year, Simms could not displace the sophomore
Applewhite, who set 10 single-season school records while throwing for 3,357
yards and 21 touchdowns.
Simms threw 36 passes in seven games.
Now what?
Applewhite tore the ligaments in his left knee during the Cotton Bowl, an
injury he guessed could be used for an excuse to usher in the Simms era.
"The college game is a business," Applewhite says.
But Applewhite made it his business to get his left knee back to 100%, which
he say it is.
How does Brown have the race handicapped?
"Both parents like their son better than they like the other parents' son,"
he says.
Brown says both quarterbacks will play. He faced a similar quandary at North
Carolina, when he successfully platooned Chris Keldorf and Oscar Davenport.
But Simms, a 6-foot-5 sophomore, is already antsy, knowing he probably would
have been starting this year had he gone to Tennessee.
"Yep," Simms says. "That's the choice I made, and I live with it. But I'm
happy here, beyond belief."
Simms knows quarterback controversies; he's still bitter about Scott Brunner
beating his dad out for the Giants' starting job in 1980.
"[Bill] Parcells chickened out," Chris says of the Giants' former coach.
Simms is guessing one man is going to end up with the job.
"I can't see it going through the season," he says of the platoon system. "I
don't think it could work. It creates too much turmoil for the team."
Simms and Applewhite appear to be good friends and both insist they will not
let this become a wedge issue on a team.
"There is not going to be any 'Chris' camps, because I won't let that
happen," Simms says.
Applewhite says the quarterbacks can't do it alone.
"It'll take a lot more than Chris Simms and I to handle it right," he says.
"There are a lot of friends involved, loyalties."
Brown says this story will be played out peacefully.
"I'm not going to let a pouting quarterback ruin our season," he says.
Applewhite notes that no Texas quarterback since 1990 has started and
finished the same season.
Darrell Royal hasn't taken sides on the quarterback issue, but has offered
Brown a bit of general advice.
Brown: "Darrell says that if you got it you make it. If you don't got it,
you won't make it. And if you don't know what 'it' is, you haven't got a
chance.
"Our theme for this year is 'it.' "

Spring Shows UT Has Fine Passing Offense,
Defense, but Questions Persist Elsewhere

The Longhorns wrapped up spring football practice last week and the best news
I can give you after watching all 15 practices is that the passing offense
and defense should both be very good this season.
The run defense probably won't be as good as last year's rock-solid group,
but it will be a faster group that should be good against the run and much
improved at rushing passers.
The running offense still looks spotty, but coach Mack Brown says it is
improved and will look much better in the fall when injured offensive guards
Antwan Kirk-Hughes and Tillman Holloway return.
When they return, by the way, look for the team's other fine guard, Derrick
Dockery, to move to left tackle.
The one huge problem that surfaced in the spring was in the kicking game. JC
transfer Brian Bradford and redshirt freshman Justin Smith both did a good
job of punting, but the place-kickers had a tough spring.
Redshirt freshman Matt McFadden showed fair consistency on field goals up to
35 yards, but struggled mightily on the longer ones.
Brown expressed concern about the kicking and said three walk-ons will be
reporting in August and will get chances to win the job.
So, looking at the big picture, I see the last year of the softer schedule
(no Nebraska or Kansas State) as one in which the Longhorns will have a
passing game that will strike terror into opposing teams' hearts, and a pass
defense that should be one of the best around, too.
But UT teams don't usually win big games unless they can run fairly well (13
yards at Stanford, minus 7 against Oklahoma and 54 in the Oregon game in the
Holiday Bowl). Those were the three games the team lost.
Brown says one of the tailbacks needs to jump out of the pack and give the
team a go-to guy. If one of them doesn't do it, look for super recruit Cedric
Benson to be a factor very quickly.
Brown doesn't like to talk about Benson because he doesn't want him to put
any extra pressure on him.
But Benson is a guy who thrives on pressure. Fifteen touchdowns in three
Class 5A championship games shows how pressure affects him.
Hopefully, he will do for the running game what true freshmen WRs Roy
Williams, B. J. Johnson and Sloan Thomas did for the passing game last season.
With junior QB Chris Simms and five or six outstanding WRs to go with two
extremely gifted TEs, the Longhorns should have at great passing attack.
If Simms continues to make progress in looking away from his target, Texas
will have a great passing attack. He hit 56% of his passes and averaged 16
yards per completion last year, but he had only eight touchdowns and four of
his seven interceptions were run back all the way.
He was much better this spring about concealing his intended target.
I think he will continue to improve and, if he does, the passing game will be
so potent that it will make it easier to run.
The other key to getting the running game jump-started is getting better run
blocking from the line.
The line worked more on run blocking this spring than it has in previous
springs under Brown, and he thinks that will pay off with a better running
attack when the season starts.
I'll make a prediction right now that if the Horns can run for 100 yards in
every regular-season game, they won't lose any of them.
Brown says he isn't concerned about the yardage, but is concerned about the
ability to pick up short yardage on third downs and about being able to run
the ball in the fourth quarter to protect a lead.
I'll second that. The Longhorns don't have to run for 100 yards if they can
run it successfully when they really need to run it.
Many teams, and particularly teams in the Big 12, are stacking the line of
scrimmage to force teams to throw.
After Simms and Company show how they can stretch a defense, I don't think
many teams will want to force Texas to throw.
The defense, meanwhile, is much faster than last season. Strong safety Lee
Jackson is primarily a strongside linebacker now, and converted cornerbacks
Ahmad Brooks and Nathan Vasher are two of the top three safeties.
Former outside linebacker O. J. McClintock is a pass-rushing defensive end,
and defensive end Maurice Gordon is at defensive tackle.
Sophomore Marcus Tubbs had a strong spring at DT, and Lee, if he returns
healthy in the fall, should team with sophomore Adam Doiron, the other spring
starter, to give the Horns three good tackles.
Gordon is already an outstanding pass-rushing tackle, and Brown said he will
try to bulk up a little in the off season to be better at handling the run,
too.
Starting DEs Kalen Thornton and Cory Redding return, as do all three LBs and
three of the four DBs.
Against Oklahoma, the best team the Horns will face in the regular season,
this type of lighter, faster defensive unit should have a better chance to
succeed.
It should be better against the passing teams and it might be almost as good
against the running teams.
The Achilles heel could be the place-kicking unless McFadden, walk-on Dylan
Becker or one of the three incoming walk-ons takes charge.

my projected depth chart because the coaches didn't release one):

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown had to juggle spring football practice this year because of
the tragic death of Cole Pittman and a series of thunderstorms, but he says
it was  "the most physical and successful spring in our four years here."
"One of our main goals was to be tougher, more physical," he said after
spring practice concluded last Wednesday. "We worked harder, we had our ones
go against our ones more and we worked on being tougher and on getting better
every day.
"We didn't have a bad practice," he said. "They worked hard every day, and
that's when you get better. We did get better."
Brown said he was very pleased with the progress the team made during the 15
spring workouts but said there are still some problems heading into the
off-season program and fall workouts.
"We still have some unanswered questions such as developing depth along the
defensive line and we need a tailback to step forward," he said.
He said "Victor Ike would start at tailback if we played tomorrow and Brett
Robin would be second team."
"Our running game has improved, we've continued to improve our protections
and our throwing and catching with our receivers is getting better," he added.
While he isn't pleased with the production at tailback, he said the running
game will be better this season because of improvement in the offensive line.
"Mike Williams at tackle and Derrick Dockery at guard played as well as any
offensive linemen have played in the spring since we got here" he said.
"Even though we lost two great defensive players in Casey Hampton and Shaun
Rogers and an outstanding safety in Greg Brown, our defense has continued to
improve and has better team speed than last year," Brown said.
He said strong senior leadership gives the team a chance "to be really
successful on defense next season."
Sophomore OG Tillman Holloway and redshirt freshman DT Stevie Lee were the
only Longhorns who suffered serious injuries in the spring.
Holloway sprained a knee during the first week of workouts,and Lee had
surgery on the same foot that sidelined him for the last 10 games of the 2000
season, which qualified him for a medical redshirt season.
Seniors Antwan Kirk-Hughes (shoulder) and Mike Jones (knee) missed the entire
spring season while recovering from offseason surgery and sophomore tight end
Artie Ellis sat out with a stress fracture in his leg.
"We were able to get through the spring without any significant injuries that
would keep someone from missing time in the fall," Brown said. "All the guys
who missed this spring because of injuries last fall should be back to full
strength when we start up again in August."
He said he was tremendously pleased with progress of sophomore TE Bo Scaife,
who returned after missing the entire 2000 season with a knee injury.
Scaife tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during the first
pre-season practice last August.
"I was really pleased with Bo's improvement toward the end of the spring,"
Brown said. "We held him out of the majority of contact drills, but the more
he played, the more you could tell he was getting physically ready to play.
"He should come back with great confidence in the fall after having a solid
month of practice this spring."
He also said one big spring goal was to develop more depth, and he said the
team made good progress in that area.
With Lee out with his foot injury, it left the team really thin at DT, but
moving Gordon over helped a lot.
"If Stevie hadn't been injured, we probably wouldn't have moved Maurice from
end to tackle," Brown said.
"Maurice looks really good at tackle and, when Stevie comes back, we'll have
a lot better depth there."
"The program is growing at the pace we'd hoped it would when we came here
three years ago," Brown said.
"Each year we have developed more depth and experience and from top to bottom
have become an improved team with a better grasp of our overall program.
"Last year, we played more players across the board than we had in our first
two years and that is what saved our season in the end.
"We had so many players injured that it took a lot of guys stepping up for us
to be successful."

Part 2

Recruiting Roundup

I started my last recruiting article raving about UT WR recruit Roy William=
s
of Odessa Permian, and I'm going to do it again this time because he broke
the state record in the broad jump Saturday without even warming up.
Williams, who had a previous best leap of 24-4, soared 25-6, on his first
jump in the State Class 5A Track Meet and that broke the nine-year-old
record
of 25-4 1/2 and wound up winning by more than a foot.
He did prove to be mortal later in the meet by finishing second in the high
jump at 6-10 and third in the 100 meters in 10.48. In the high jump, he tie=
d
for the winning height, but had to settle for second  due to more misses at
lower heights than the winner.
But those other guys high jumping, broad jumping and sprinting were dwarfed
by Williams' big 6-3, 205-pound frame. He is a rare talent and Horn fans ar=
e
going to be very, very glad he signed with UT.
* * * *
Now, let's talk about this season's top recruits.
With the departure of redshirt freshman QB Adam Hall, who has decided to
transfer, the Longhorns really need to sign a top QB this year. Sophomore
Chris Simms, junior Major Applewhite and incoming recruit Chance Mock will
be
the only scholarship QBs this season.
This is not a great year for QBs in Texas, and the Longhorns have been
looking outside the state, primarily in Louisiana, to try to find one.
That's always risky because LSU usually cherry picks the top players in the
Bayou State.
There might be some hope this year, however, because there are three QBs in
Louisiana who are being highly recruited, and even LSU coaches can't talk
three Lousiana QBs into signing in the same year.
Perrin Rittiner of New Orleans Jesuit probably is the top passer in
Louisiana, but Dayne Ashley of Jena threw for 39 touchdowns last year.
Ashley
also came to the Nike camp at Texas May 7.
Ronnie Prude of Shreveport Fair Park is a great runner-passer combo QB who
could play another position in college if things don't work out at QB.
All three have some interest in Texas, and a top Midwestern QB, Travis
Jackson of Olathe South HS in Kansas, also came to the Austin Nike camp and
was impressive.
There are two good passing QBs in Texas, but Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop
Lynch is looking exclusively at out-of-state schools and Mike Pankratz of
Katy Taylor doesn't have Texas in his top three.
The Longhorns also are looking at a lot of out-of-state running backs,
headed
by two big, fast super prospects =01) Eric Shelton of Lexington, Ky., Bryan
Station and Jabari Davis of Tucker, Ga.
Both Shelton and Davis have some interest in Texas. In fact, Davis is known
as "Little Earl" because folks in Georgia say his running style reminds the=
m
of Earl Campbell.
On his highlight film, Davis includes tape of Campbell running for the
Houston Oilers and Ricky Williams running for the Longhorns, so he
definitely
has some knowledge and admiration for the power-runners of the past at UT.
While we're on the subject of out-of-state recruiting, big Florida FB James
Bu
chanan, a tremendous blocker and power runner, says he wants to visit UT,
and
DE Eric Hall of Clarksville, Tenn., is a top prospect who was born in Fort
Hood and is interested in returning to Texas.
I listed all the top out-of-state prospects I've seen on tape who say there
are interested in Texas on page 4 and this page, but the ones I wrote about
are the main ones at this point.
It would be nice if the Horns could get one of the big DTs I listed from
Louisiana, but they don't seem that serious about Texas at this point.
The coaches will find some more top out-of-state prospects during this
months' evaluation period, but they are going to be able to fill most of
their needs without leaving Texas.
* * * *
Sophomore center Greg Barnum has lost his appeal to get an unconditional
release from Tennessee.
Vol coach Phil Fulmer told Barnum he would release him only to a Division
1-AA school, such as Stephen F. Austin, but Barnum wanted an unconditional
release and appealed to a faculty committee, which turned him down last
week=3D

Longhorns Will Wrap Up Spring Football Drills Wednesday

The Longhorns worked out in shorts Monday, and coach Mack Brown said the
tea=
m=20
will practice Tuesday at? 4 p.m. and then scrimmage Wednesday, probably at
5=
=20
p.m., to wrap up what he termed "our best spring? since we've been here."
Brown said the Tuesday practice will be at the Denius Fields and the=20
Wednesday scrimmage will be at Royal Memorial Stadium. He said he would=20
announce a time for the scrimmage at Tuesday's practice.
NCAA rules require that three of the 15 spring practices be in shorts,
and=20
Brown said that was the reason the team practiced in shorts Monday. "We=20
practiced in shorts the first two days, and we had to get a third day in=20
shorts," he said.
The Horns worked primarily on their passing game because it's hard to do
muc=
h=20
on the running game in shorts. QB Chris Simms continued to look very
sharp,=20
and sophomore TEs Bo Scaife and Brock Edwards both made several
outstanding=20
catches. Everyone knows about the Longhorns' fine WRs, but there won't be
a=20
better pair of TEs in the Big 12 than Scaife and Edwards. There might not
be=
=20
a better pair in the country.
Brown said the Longhorns will have more speed on defense this season
than=20
they have had since he got here. "Everything we're doing is trying to get
th=
e=20
fastest guys on the field," he said, noting that former LB O. J.
McClintock=20
is doing a good job of pass rushing at DE, and former DE Maurice Gordon
is=20
doing the same at DT.=20
"In each case, those moves were made to increase our speed," he said.
* * * *
If you saved the class chart in my March 12 newsletter, take a look at
the=20
players in each class and see how many top hands you see. I did that
today=20
and I counted nine fine players in the sophomore class, plus three others
wh=
o=20
might be fine players, too. No other class has more than five, although
the=20
12 redshirted freshmen might produce more than that.
I'm not going to identify the guys who I think are really good in each
class=
=20
because then it would be obvious which starters I don't think are really=20
good. I try to avoid being overly critical of any of the kids,? so I
would=20
suggest you look at the class chart, too, and see how you think the
various=20
classes rank.
One other important thing to note is that senior CB Quentin Jammer is an=20
outstanding player who is projected to be the first defensive back picked
in=
=20
the next NFL draft. But he has a very hard time covering either of the=20
Longhorns' pair of star sophomore wide receivers (Roy Williams and B. J.=20
Johnson) on a consistent basis.
Opposing teams usually double cover Williams, which means Johnson and
the=20
tight ends draw single coverage. That is going to make the Longhorns'
passin=
g=20
game more potent than ever this season.
Scaife is regaining the form he showed last spring before injuring his
knee=20
during the pre-season workouts. If he hadn't missed last season, I think
the=
=20
Longhorns would have gone 11-1. Obviously, he wouldn't have made that
much=20
difference in the 63-14 loss to Oklahoma, but I think he would have made
a=20
big difference in the narrow losses to Stanford and Oregon. The
Longhorns=20
were building their passing offense around him before his injury, and he=20
would have helped buy time for the true freshmen wide receivers to begin=20
helping out.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: The Longhorns are leading for a great wide receiver=20
prospect from Champaign, Illinois. He is Marquis Johnson, 6-3, 190, 4.4.
UT=20
assistant Tim Brewster, an Illinois graduate, is handling the

Johnson says he already has an offer from Illinois, but he says Texas

Horns Get Super Wide Receiver

Marquis Johnson, 6-3, 200, 4.48, of Centennial High School in Champaign,
Illinois, the big, fast, tough wide receiver the Longhorns have been
recruiting for months, committed to UT Sunday.
Johnson, a national top 100 prospect and one of the top wide receivers in the
country, took his official visit to Texas this weekend and said he committed
to UT head coach Mack Brown before returning home.
Texas assistant coach Tim Brewster did an outstanding recruiting job with
Johnson, who listed Texas No. 1 throughout the recruiting process.
Johnson said he picked the Longhorns because "I love their offense. They
really run a pro-type offense. It's a dream offense for a wide receiver."
Johnson is the 15th early commitment for Texas and is the ninth one who is
listed on one or more national top 100 teams.
The other eight recruits who have been listed on top national teams are DE
Chase Pittman, 6-5, 263, 4.7, of Shreveport Evangel; LB Garnett Smith, 6-3,
221, 4.54, of Arlington Lamar, DTs Sonny Davis, 6-1, 320, 5.0, of Gulf Coast
JC in Mississippi and formerly of Austin Lanier, Earl Anderson, 6-4, 270,
4.8, of San Marcos, Lyle Sendlein, 6-4,  260, 4.8, of Scottsdale Chaparral,
the two-time defending Class 4A champion in Arizona;  OLs  Brett Valdez, 6-4,
310, 5.1, of  Brownwood and Neale Tweedie, 6-5, 260, 4.9, of Allen;  and TE
David Thomas, 6-3, 210, 4.6, of Wolfforth Frenship;
Davis made all of the top national lists last year.
The other Longhorn pledges are DT  Tully Janszen, 6-4, 255, 4.78, of Keller;
LBs Brian Robison, 6-3, 245, 4.6, of Splendora and Marcus Myers, 6-3, 220,
4.5, of Pflugerville Connally;   WR Dustin Miksch, 6-0, 165, 4.4, of Round
Rock Westwood;  QB Billy Don Malone, 6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7, of  Paris North
Lamar, and  RB/Ath Clint Haney, 5-11, 190, 4.27 of Smithson Valley.
DB Matthew Melton of Tyler John Tyler had planned to come to Texas on an
unofficial visit last weekend, but was not able to make it. He told me he is
planning to commit to Texas soon.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: Super QB Vincent Young, 6-5, 200, 4.4, of Houston Madison
says his top two teams right now are Texas and Miami. Young is one of the
nation's top quarterback prospects. He also is an outstanding basketball
player, but wants to concentrate on football in college. . . The
Texas-Oklahoma game Saturday will be a big factor in deciding where several
top recruits go, including OL Justin Blalock of Plano East, DE Larry Dibbles
of Lancaster, LB Aaron Harris of North Mesquite and DE Bryan Pickryl of
Jenks, Oklahoma. All of them are national top 100 recruits. . . I have moved
Lufkin QB Reggie McNeal to the Athlete category on my Blue Chip list on page
2. He is a great athlete with tremendous speed. I saw him play when Lufkin
hosted Shreveport Evangel and think he is one of the state's top prospects,
but might wind up at wide receiver or defensive back in college. I usually
don't explain moves like this, but he is an Aggie commitment and many of the
A&M gurus always move Longhorn signees down in their rankings when they
commit to Texas. I still have McNeal ranked very high, but have changed his
projected position. . . WR Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus has played
very little high school football because of transfers and disciplinary
problems, but he is a great athlete who would be on all the national lists if
he had played as much as the other top guys. He is very interested in Texas
and other top schools, but many of them are waiting to see how he fares for
the rest of the season - on the field and in the citizenship area - before
pulling the trigger on an offer. . . RB Selvin Young of Jersey Village is
opening some eyes again this season. He was sensational in rushing for more
than 2,000 yards as a sophomore, but was hampered by an ankle injury
throughout his junior year.

Horns No. 5 in Polls

Texas stayed at the No. 5 in both major national polls this week and Oklahoma
remained No. 3, setting up a big battle Saturday in Dallas.

Key Statistics

Tech's outstanding RB Ricky Williams had a 31-yard run for the Raiders' only
score, but he had four other carries for just 11 yards and he had nine pass
receptions for only 15 yards. The Longhorns accomplished that with a swarming
defense that usually had one linebacker with just one assignment - tackle
Williams.

Scouting Oklahoma

The Longhorns will find out just how far they have progressed this season
when they meet the ultimate measuring stick - Oklahoma - Saturday in Dallas.
The game is at 2:30 p.m. and will televised over most of the nation by ABC.
Oklahoma, the defending national champion, gleefully provided the lowest ebb
in the Longhorns' season last year with a 63-14 drubbing.
Texas rebounded from that debacle and went on to a 9-3 season But this is the
year the Longhorns have been working toward since the arrival of coach Mack
Brown and his staff.
For the first time, they have three straight outstanding recruiting classes
and their play so far this season indicates the really might finish in the
top 10 nationally for the first time since 1983.
Saturday's game with OU will either solidly entrench the Longhorns in the
upper part of the top 10, or it will send them plummeting, at least
temporarily, once again.
The Sooners won a big one last week, edging powerful Kansas State, 38-37, in
Norman.
OU QB Nate Hybl has completed 79 of 138 passes (57.25%) for 946 yards and six
touchdowns, with six interceptions. He is averaging 236.5 yards a game
through the air.
RB Quentin Griffin and WR Antwone Savage are the other two members of the
Sooners' big three offensively. The Sooners are running more this year and
Griffin is averaging 92 yards per game rushing. He also is one of Hybl's
favorite pass receivers.
Savage, who turned an ankle late in the K-State game, had two long scoring
plays against the Wildcats' tough defense and he also threw a touchdown pass
on a trick play.
Defensively, the Sooners are very solid and very opportunistic. LB Rocky
Calmus is adept at scoring defensive touchdowns.
To win, the Longhorns must:
1. Get another good, balanced performance from the offense.
2. Play outstanding defense and keep the Sooners guessing on offense.
3. Avoid giving Oklahoma any defensive touchdowns.
4. Play four tough quarters.
Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):

1. Texas is still recruiting Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch, Colorado. I
listed him in my out-of-state prospects, but inadvertantly omitted him in the
article when I was writing about guys UT is still recruiting.

2. Marquis Johnson did make it to Austin, but didn't meet with any coaches. I
talked to him mother last night and she said he never got to Austin, but I
checked with Marquis today and he said he drove to Austin and looked around
and like what he saw, but did not meet with any coaches.

Horns Snare 10 Early Commitments; Several Other Top Prospects Leaning UT's =
Way

Coach Mack Brown and his staff have signed the best recruiting class in the
Big 12 the last two years and they are well on their way to making it three
in a row.
The Longhorns have 10 early commitments, including two national top 100
prospects and a junior college star who was a national top 100 prospect two
years ago.
And all three of those headliners are offensive linemen, which is an area
where the Longhorns needed to strike it rich this time around after signing
only three of the big guys in their last class, which was loaded with skill
position players.
The national top 100 prepsters are Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter, and Abe
Robinson of Jersey Village. The JC star is Alfio Randall, 6-6, 300, 5.1, of
Blinn JC. Randall was one of the nation's top prospects at Houston Yates an=
d
signed with Texas in February of 1999 before failing to qualify academicall=
y
and heading to Blinn.
Randall, who says he will graduate in December, plans to enroll at Texas ne=
xt
January.
For a team that listed the offensive line as its greatest need heading into
this recruiting season, that trio is a great way to start.
But the Longhorns also have pledges from three other offensive linemen who
were highly recruited, including one from Mike Garcia of Galena Park, who h=
ad
committed to Texas A&M and was the Aggies' prize early pledge before visiti=
ng
UT and deciding to switch to the Horns.
The other two offensive line recruits are Roman Reeves of Livingston and Wi=
ll
Allen of Cypress Falls.
The offensive line class of recruits in Texas this year is the best I have
seen since I started doing this 10 years ago. There are at least 10 offensi=
ve
linemen who are top notch, and all five of the UT pledges come from that
group.
The other recruits who have committed to the Longhorns are middle linebacke=
r
Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison, safety Kendal Briles of Frenship and
defensive backs Brian Carter of The Woodlands and Braden Johnson of Euless
Trinity.
Here's a little information on each of the Horns' early commitments:
Offensive Line (6)
Jonathan Scott, 6-7, 290, 4.9, Dallas Carter, has more than 25 scholarship
offers and more are coming in all the time, despite the fact that he was th=
e
Longhorns' first commitment, back on June 7 at Texas' first summer camp. He
has the great first step that makes all the difference in trying to cut off
an outside speed rusher. He is on all the national top 100 lists and is as
good an offensive tackle prospect as there is in the country.
Abe Robinson, 6-6, 270, 4.9, Jersey Village, is a tight end who projects as
an offensive lineman in college. He is one of the state's top prospects and
is on most of the national top 100 lists. Robinson is a power blocker with
quick feet. He had offers from 12 other schools, including Florida State,
when he committed to Texas on June 13.
Alfio Randall, 6-6, 300, 5.1, Blinn JC, was one of the first players to
commit to Texas in 1998 and has never wavered. He says he will graduate fro=
m
Blinn in December and enroll at UT in January so he can go through spring
practice next year. He was the state's top offensive line prospect at Houst=
on
Yates his senior year because of his quick feet and punishing blocking styl=
e.
Mike Garcia, 6-5, 280, 5.2, Galena Park, was an early A&M commitment before
he and his mother took an unofficial trip to Austin. He is as aggressive as
any offensive line prospect in Texas. A nice guy off the field, he holds
blocks and punishes defenders. He specializes in the pancake block.
Will Allen, 6-5, 300, 5.2, Cypress Falls, was the Longhorns' second
commitment. Like Scott, he committed after the first full summer camp at UT=
.
A three-year starter at Cy Falls, he is a very physical player who has the
quickness and strength to play guard or tackle.
Roman Reeves, 6-6, 295, 5.2, Livingston, is as impressive a physical specim=
en
as any of the UT recruits. He has the ability to dominate his opponents and
the quickness to head them off.
Linebacker (1)
Yamil LeBron, 6-2, 240, 4.7, Killeen Ellison, apparently was the middle
linebacker UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese wanted all along. He said
Reese told him at the Longhorns' summer camp that he liked his size, speed
and ferocity and wanted him to play middle linebacker. He is a tough run
stopper who also has the speed to cover backs on pass plays.
Defensive Back (3)
Kendal Briles, 5-10, 175, 4.5, Wolfforth Frenship, was the Class 4A offensi=
ve
player of the year last season after leading Stephenville to the  state
championship. Playing QB, he completed 207 of 356 passes for 3,115 yards an=
d
28 TDs and ran for 1,331 yards and 16 more scores. That adds up to 4,446
yards and 44 touchdowns. Nebraska wanted him as an option QB, but he opted
for a career as a safety at Texas. His father, Art Briles, was his coach at
Stephenville and now is on the coaching staff at Texas Tech.
Braden Johnson, 6-2, 200, 4.5, Euless Trinity, is a talented athlete who wi=
ll
move to QB for the Trojans this year after making All-District as a
hard-hitting safety last year. He is a centerfielder in baseball and runs o=
n
the school's 400-meter relay team. He has a big frame and could be a
candidate to become an outside linebacker in the future.
Brian Carter, 5-11, 180, 4.5, The Woodlands, was a two-way star last season=
,
catching 35 passes for 340 yards and four TDs, then switching over to defen=
se
and intercepting three passes. He was one of UT freshman QB Chance Mock's t=
op
targets at The Woodlands last season.
All of the recruits who have committed to Texas except Randall and Garcia
came to one of the UT summer camps.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: The state's top QB prospect, Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bish=
op
Lynch, was in Austin today (Monday) visiting with UT offensive coordinator
Greg Davis. His family owns a ranch near Blanco and Nordgren really likes t=
he
Horns. The only other top QB prospect who is strongly considering Texas is
Bret Rawls of Shreveport Evangel, but the Horns only plan to take one QB an=
d
Rawls is such a good baseball prospect that it would be risky making him th=
e
only QB recruit. One big plus is that Nordgren wants to commit early. He ha=
s
been to several camps alread, including one at Texas, and wants to visit
several more before making a decision. But if he does commit early and does
commit to Texas, the Longhorns can forget about recruiting QBs. If he commi=
ts
early to someone else, then it will be on Plan B, whether that is Rawls or =
a
sleeper like Tye Gunn of La Grange, a strong-armed kid who is big and fast
and only gets to throw five or six times a game for the run-oriented
Leopards. . . The Longhorns probably will sign about 20 to 22 recruits. Wit=
h
six offensive linemen, three defensive backs and one linebacker already
committed, the remainder probably will go to one QB, one or two RBs, zero o=
r
one FB, zero or one TE, one or two WRs, one or two more OLs, three or four
DLs, one or two LBs and two or three DBs. . . At RB, record-setting Cedric
Benson of two-time state champ Midland Lee plans to take an unofficial visi=
t
to Texas in late July or early August. He is a long-time Longhorn fan who
says he might commit on his visit. . . The most important report left on th=
e
board is DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison. Why? There are two reasons.
First, he is a great prospect, probably as good a defensive line recruit as
there is in the country. Second, he is the only great DT prospect who is
strongly considering Texas and the Horns need to sign a top DT or two. Thom=
as
Derricks of Dallas Jesuit is a good DT, but he has no interest in Texas.
After that, the list includes several promising young DTs who need to have
big senior years to become top prospects. Texas is chasing two Louisiana
stars =01) Marcus Spears of Baton Rouge Southern Lab and Marquise Hill of N=
ew
Orleans De La Salle =01) but they have not show any major interest so far. =
The
UT coaches want to sign two DEs and two DTs, but they might opt for three D=
Es
because there are more top DEs. . . The top prospects remaining who I think
are at least 50-50 shots to sign with Texas are Nordgren, Benson, Harris, O=
L
Jami Hightower of Jacksonville, DEs Kevin Everett of Port Arthur Jefferson
and Eric Hall of Clarksville, Tenn., LB-DE Lance McFarland of Jefferson, LB
Derrick Johnson of Waco, CB Cedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes, safety
Dewayne Brandon of Temple and CB-Athlete Quan Cosby of Mart.

900 Number Updated Often

I update my 900 number at least three times a week  with recruiting and oth=
er
football news.  The number is 1-900-288-8839. It costs $1.59 a minute. You
must be 18 to call.

Coach's Corner

Defensive coordinator Carl Reese is always a great interview because (a) he
is an expert at his craft and (b) he is good at putting complex defensive
schemes in terms we can all understand.
I interviewed him recently about his defense and his expectations for the
2000 season. With most of the guys returning from  a defense that was one o=
f
the nation's best in 1999, he is upbeat, but he wants and expects to see
major improvements in several areas.
Here are the highlights of our conversation:
Q: "Coach, you lost both your defensive ends. At the end of the spring, you
seemed pretty happy about the way Cory Redding was playing, but you said yo=
u
thought the guys on the other side were a lot better pass rushers than run
stoppers. The way the 2000 schedule shapes up, it looks like most of the
teams Texas plays are better passing teams than running teams, so do you
think it could be an advantage to have a better pass rush, even if one side
isn't as strong against the run?
A: "We were looking at the schedule the other day and it looks like about
half the teams we play next fall are going to be four wide-outs who throw t=
he
ball a bunch.And our ends can come of the edge better than they have. That
could help us against some teams like Stanford, Oklahoma and Texas Tech,
three teams that are going to let it go (pass a lot) from the beginning. Bu=
t
I worry about that cotton-picking run because I don't want to let teams be
two-dimensional. I like to start, with any defense, by being stroing agains=
t
the run."
Q: "You have already had some outstanding defenses at Texas. Do you think
this year's defense will be your best one at Texas?
A: "From a talent standpoint, it could be. The secondary has more depth tha=
n
its had. Of course, the guys still have to come through. We have got to get=
 a
great year out of Quentin Jammer at cornerback, but, going into the season,
we have the deepest secondary we've had. We're a little thin at linebacker,
but we know what we have there and they can all run. We know what we have a=
t
tackle with Casey (Hampton) and Shawn (Rogers), and we've got some backups.
The glaring weakness is at end, particularly against the run. We want to ha=
ve
the complete package at end =01) guys who can stop the run and rush the pas=
ser.
Cory Redding still had to work on the run some, but as far as giving an
all-out effort, he does, and he'll improve as he gets some more experience.
He is our best end against the run, but we want him to get better. We need
some of the other guys to step up on the other side, and maybe one or two o=
f
them will. If they do, this could be a pretty good defense."
Q: Stevie Lee really looked good at tackle this spring, in my opinions,
particularly considering the fact that he was playing high school football
last fall, then graduated early  and enrolled in January. What do you think
about him and his chances of helping you this fall?
A: "I think Stevie Lee is going to be a real football player. And you're
right =01) he should have been walking the halls of his high school in the
spring. What I really like about him is that we would work him against the
first-team offense, and some of those first-team offensive linemen would
knock him back. But the next play, he would come right back. He learns fast
and he competes hard. We play to play him quite a bit. From what he and
(redshirt freshman Marcus) Tubbs showed this spring, they will be the backu=
ps
to Casey and Shawn at the start of fall practice. We have some other player=
s
who could move up, too, and there will be some competition because the guys
who are the top backups this year will have the best chance to take it over
the next season when Casey and Shawn are gone."
Q: "What do you think is the key to having a better defense this year?"
A: "The secondary will be the key. They have the best chance to step up.
That's the key, overall. They improved last year and played good at times,
but we still didn't have a great defense because we gave up big plays too
often to be a great defense. We're going to stress this year that we can't
give up big plays because you can't be a great defense if you do that."
Q: "What is you definition of a big play?"
A: "Any pass over 20 yards and any run over 12 yards is a big play. If we c=
an
stop giving those up, we'll be better than we have been."
Q: "Every time anybody talks about the strength of the Texas' defense, it
centers around your two tackles. How important are they, and what do you
expect from them this season?"
A: "Both Casey and Shawn are strong, physical guys. When they go all out,
they can dominate. They really work well together, too. It is really
important that we be sure they give us a great year. They have proved they
can be great  run stoppers, but we're going to try to push them into being
good pass rush guys, too. Their reall challenge now is to go out and produc=
e
again as run stoppers and get better on the pass rush. They need to work to=
=20
improve. I haven't been satisfied with the endurance part of it, as far as
they are concerned. If I'm sitting there in their shoes, I'm looking to be
just as strong against the run and get better on the pass rush."
Q: "Speaking of young players, Dakarai Pearson and Phillip Geiggar, your tw=
o
freshmen at safety, made some big plays in the spring. Do you think they ca=
n
help you this season?"
A: "That Dakarai just improved so much this spring. Everytime I turned on a
practice film, I saw some improvement. He just got better every day. He als=
o
has some leadership capabilities. I think we are going to get a lot of big
plays out of him, and we might get some this year. He's going to be a real
good strong safety if he keeps working at it. Phillip has a lot of the same
qualities. You know, Dakarai has been in the system longer (he's a redshirt
freshman) and Phillip should have been walking those same high school halls
with Stevie Lee. He's going to be a really good one, too, if he keeps
improving. He just needs some experience. He's probably going to get some
kick returns and punt returns this year, and he'll probably get to play som=
e
at safety, too."
Q: "Is one of them more suited to strong safety and one more suited to free
safety?"
A: "Those kids are interchangeable. The strong safety calls the defenses an=
d
goes to pass strength, so Dakarai probably would play there this year becau=
se
Phillip hasn't been here as long, but, as they both get more experience, th=
ey
both can play either one."

Applewhite OK; Simms Growing

Record-setting Texas QB Major Applewhite's surgically repaired knee is fine
and he will be ready to do battle with heralded sophomore Chris Simms for t=
he
starting job when pre-season football practice begins next month.
Simms, meanwhile, has been hitting the weights and is now packing 223 pound=
s
on his 6-5 frame, up from 208 last season.
The UT coaches have said all along they plan to play two quarterbacks this
season, and no one in the country has a better pair to alternate.
Both are throwing the ball extremely well and both appear to be capable of
leading the Longhorns in defense of their Big 12 Southern Division crown.
If there is going to be a quarterback controversy at Texas, it's sure nice =
to
know both of them are outstanding quarterbacks.
Some of Texas' conference rivals probably will have a quarterback
controversy, too, but it will be over whether any of the contenders are goo=
d
enough to lead the team to a title. The Longhorns have two
championship-calibre quarterbacks.

Snyder Retires as Tennis Coach

Long-time UT tennis coach Dave Snyder has retired. Snyder did a great job f=
or
the Longhorns and let's all wish him well in retirement.
Let's also hope the Longhorns will hire his former top assistant, Dwayne
Hultquist, to succeed him.
Hultquist, currently the head tennis coach at Florida State, is an
outstanding recruiter who can do great things at Texas if he gets the chanc=
e.
Hultquist, who just completed his first year as the head coach at FSU, got
the Seminoles into the NCAA Tournament for the first time in several years.
He is one of the top candidates for the job, which probably will be filled
within the next 10 days.

Injury Update

Junior DE O. J. McClintock suffered slashed muscles and tendons in his right
arm in a household accident and underwent surgery the week before practice
started. He is expected to miss three or four games.
Junior WR Kyle Shanahan, a walk-on who is being counted on provide some key
receptions, suffered a puncture wound in his thigh while trying to leap over
a fence just a few days before practice started. Coach Brown says he might be
back before the opener.
Senior LB Tyrone Jones (bruised shoulder), freshman CB Cedric Griffin
(sprained ankle) and freshman safety Rufus Harris (sore quad) are expected
back at practice this week.
Sophomore CB Monti Collier (strained hamstring) and freshman RB Anthony
Johnson (stress fracture in foot) are out indefinitely.
On the plus side, redshirt freshman DT Stevie Lee seems to be completely
recovered after his off-season foot surgery.

Two Veterans Missing

Sophomore TE Artie Ellis and senior LB Jon Wyndham are not on the team this
year. Ellis, who is trying to recover from a persistent shin injury, says he
will return in January. Wyndham never redshirted, so he has another year of
eligibility, but he probably won't be back.

Projected 2001 Longhorn Football Roster By Class, Position

This is a  list of  scholarship football players by class (eligibility) for
the 2001 season. Players in  bold are returning starters. Some positions list
more than one starter because a starter was injured and another player took
his place. At tight end for example, I list three starters because Bo Scaife
was due to start until he was hurt, then Mike Jones started until he was
injured and then
Brock Edwards started. Freshman running back Cedric Benson is not counted in
the scholarship total because he is a professional baseball player and is not
eligible for a football scholarship. Sophomore tight end Artie Ellis is not
in school this semester and is not on the list, but he is due to return for
the spring semester.

UT Recruit Stars in AAU

Heather Schrieber, the 6-3 Windthorst star who will be a freshman at Texas
this year, led her AAU team to the championship of the national Basketball
Coaches' Association tournament and was named the tourney MVP after averaging
29 points a game in the tourney.
The Longhorn women are off to a good start in this year's recruiting with a
pledge from point guard Nina Norman, a  5-8 star at Jersey Village who is
ranked as a national top 50 player.
Two other players Texas was recruiting have committed to other schools. Guard
Chelsi Welch, who led Plainview to the state Class 4A title last year, picked
Oklahoma, and Lindsey Harding, a  5-7 guard from Cypress Falls, who also is a
national top 50 player, chose Duke.

Volume 11, No. 20, August 13, 2001

 Horns Happy About No. 5 Pre-Season Ranking,
But Coaches, Players Say They Have to Earn It

Coach Mack Brown and the Longhorn players are happy about their No. 5 ranking
in The Associated Press' pre-season poll because they say it shows respect
for the program.
But they also say it means nothing unless they prove they deserve it.
"We can embrace the pre-season predictions because they show respect for the
University of Texas," Brown said Saturday, following the first full-team
practice, "but, starting today, I've got to do a better job of putting it
behind us."
"It's really a beauty contest," he said. " It's a farce that sells papers and
hypes the season, but it means absolutely nothing."
"What's important is today's practice and tonight's practice, and what's
important tomorrow will be tomorrow's practice. We've got to take care of our
business on the field every day."
History certainly supports Brown's feeling. The Longhorns haven't finished in
the top 10 since 1983, but they've been there in the pre-season several times.
And, while it is painful to recall, Oklahoma was  ranked No. 19 in the
pre-season poll a year ago, well below Nebraska, Kansas State and Texas, and
we all know the Sooners went 13-0, beat all three of those teams handily and
won the national title.
This pre-season poll had Florida No. 1, Miami No. 2, OU No. 3, Nebraska No. 4
and Texas No. 5.
Brown said it was nice to have three big 12 teams in the top 12 because it
"shows respect for our conference," but he also said, "it will be very
difficult for us to have three teams in the top five when the season ends."
That's definitely true because Oklahoma plays Nebraska and Texas, and whoever
wins the South title will have to play Nebraska or whoever whip the Huskers
in the Big 12's Northern Division.
The good news for the Longhorns is that Oklahoma is the only pre-season team
in the top 25 on the regular season schedule.
That is countered by a double dose of bad news.
First, the AP writers and the Big 12 coaches ranked the Sooners over the
Longhorns, and they are pretty familiar with both teams.
Second, if the Longhorns beat the Sooners, they will have two killer
post-season games, one against a powerful and probably undefeated team from
the Northern Division and, if they win that one, a Rose Bowl date against
someone like Florida or Miami for the national title.
But the Horns' best chance to get there is to take it one step at a time, and
the coaches and players are saying that's what they are going to do.
"It's one thing for people to pick us, but it's up to us to do it on the
field," said senior LB De'Andre Lewis. "We control our destiny and we have to
work hard and take care of business day-to-day and game-to-game."
"If we work hard every day and show up ready to play hard every game, the
other stuff will take care of itself."
Junior QB Chris Simms echoed those sentiments, saying, "This team is more
experienced now. We know we have to do it on the field and the stuff in the
papers and in the polls won't mean anything unless we do it on the field."
For those of you who want to know how the Longhorns are rated in everyone's
pre-season articles, I haven't seen all of them, but I have seen the major
ones and Texas is ranked No. 1 by the Sporting News, No. 3 by Lindy's and
ESPN, No. 4 by Sports Illustrated, No. 5 by the AP, No. 6 by USA Today/ESPN
(the coaches' poll) and Street & Smith, No. 8 by Football Diges and No. 15 by
Athlon.
And, like Mack Brown, I'll tell you it means absolutely nothing. Last year is
proof of that.
Some people also say Texas' schedule will keep the Horns out of the national
title game, even if they win all their games, because it doesn't include
enough tough teams.
That talk means nothing, too. Any team that wins a Big 12 division title,
then wins the league championship game and is undefeated, will be in the Rose
Bowl on Jan. 3.
Now that we've covered the what-if's, let's look at what is happening with
the Longhorns as they begin preparations to live up to those lofty pre-season
rankings.
The highly ranked freshman class had four workouts last week before the first
full team workouts started Saturday.
The freshmen weren't in full pads, but it was clear from watching the limited
contact that was allowed that DT Kaelen Jakes of Valencia, Cal., DE Eric Hall
of Clarksville, Tenn., LB Derrick Johnson of Waco, RB Cedric Benson of
Midland Lee, and several of the great group of offensive line recruits are as
big and fast and talented as advertised.
Players can't really dominate until they don full pads, which will happen
Wednesday, but Benson, while working with the freshmen Tuesday and Wednesday,
and then with the full team Saturday and Sunday, simply explodes after taking
a handoff.
High school coaches and players who faced him always said he had great speed
and power and moves, but they said the one thing that set him apart from
other great backs was the way he accelerated into the hole.
He hasn't lost any of that acceleration, and, even without getting an
opportunity to work in pads, he was running with the third team in practice
Saturday and Sunday, behind junior Victor Ike and sophomore Brett Robin.
Ike worked very hard during the off season and is sporting more muscles than
ever before. He doesn't seem to have lost any of his great speed.
Let's look at the team on a position-by-position basis, based on the limited
practices so far:

OFFENSE

Quarterback
Simms is clearly  No. 1. There is no quarterback controversy like there was
last season when Simms lacked experience and Major Applewhite wasn't fully
recovered from knee surgery. Applewhite underwent surgery on his other knee
last season and the severe knee injuries have eroded some of his once lethal
talents. He is No. 2 Redshirt freshman Chance Mock is big and fast and has a
strong arm and the coaches will make sure he plays this season. Freshman Matt
Nordgren is very big, has good speed and a strong arm, and he will redshirt
unless disaster strikes. The Sporting News not only picked UT to win the
national crown, it picked Simms to win the Heisman Trophy. He threw more
interceptions than touchdowns last season and he has to get better at looking
off receivers or he'll have more interception problems this season. In the
three practices he had Saturday and Sunday, he still seemed to home in on his
intended receiver very early. His progress in that problem area, in my
opinion, will determine whether Texas can compete for conference and national
honors.

Running Back
Ike's main asset is blinding speed, and the coaches want him to show more
consistent power. Robin's main asset is his steadiness. He runs every play
perfectly and gives great effort. Will Ike's speed and Robin's dependability
hold off Benson? I doubt it. We won't know for sure until the team starts
some serious contact, but, unless he gets hurt, Benson will play a lot in the
Sept. 1 opener against New Mexico State and I think he will be either be
starting or splitting time with the starter before mid-season. Junior Kenny
Hayter and sophomore Ivan Williams also are in contention, but Brown said
Sunday they both need to cut down on fumbling to have a chance to play.

Fullback
Junior Matt Trissel is the returning starter, but redshirt freshman Will
Matthews is bigger and faster and will push him for the top job. Junior Chad
Stevens is a good blocker and receiver and also will play, particularly on
passing downs.

Wide Receiver
Sophomores Roy Williams and B. J. Johnson starred last season as true
freshmen and will be even better this year if they stay healthy. Sophomore
Sloan Thomas also looked very good as a true freshman. Junior walk-on Kyle
Shanahan suffered a cut in his leg jumping over a fence, but should be back
in time for the first game. He is an outstanding receiver. Senior Montrell
Flowers also will play a lot. Redshirt freshman Tony Jeffery also will get
some playing time. All of them are dangerous. This position is loaded.

Tight End
Sophomore Bo Scaife has remarkable speed and receiving skills for a tight end
and he appears to be completely recovered from knee surgery. Sophomore Brock
Edwards is much bigger and also has very good speed. He started some games as
a true freshman last year. Senior Mike Jones is the best blocker of the group
and is sure handed, but he lacks the speed of Scaife and Edwards.

Left Tackle
Junior Robbie Doane held the job throughout the spring, but is getting a big
challenge from JC transfer Alfio Randall.

Left Guard
Junior Derrick Dockery and sophomore Tillman Holloway both started at times
last year and both are very talented. The Horns usually don't substitute much
in the offensive line, but coach Brown says both Dockery and Holloway will
play a lot.

Center
Senior Matt Anderson is the returning started and clear No. 1 center. Junior
Beau Baker is working at center and guard, and redshirt freshman Jason Glenn
is a talented newcomer who will push for playing time.

Right Guard
Senior Antwan Kirk-Hughes is one of the top offensive linemen around when his
shoulder is healthy, and Brown says it appears to be sound and ready for the
season. The loser of the Dockery-Holloway battle at left guard probably will
be the backup at both guard slots.

Right Tackle
Senior Mike Williams is the returning starter and one of the top tackles in
the country. He will be backed by talented redshirt freshman Lionel Garr.

DEFENSE

Left End
Junior Cory Redding led the team in sacks last season with 6.5 and is bigger
and stronger this year. Junior O. J. McClintock was his backup, but he
suffered severe cuts to his right hand and arm in a household accident and
the coaches are trying linebackers Reed Boyd and Marcus Wilkins at end until
he recovers. Brown said McClintock probably will miss the first three or four
games.

Left Tackle
Sophomores Adam Doiron and redshirt freshman Stevie Lee are battling for the
starting job. Both have talent and both played well last year as true
freshmen. Lee got a medical hardship because he broke a bone in his foot in
the second game, so he is again a freshman.

Right Tackle
Sophomore Marcus Tubbs played well last year standing in for injured senior
star Shaun Rogers, and he has been looking great in the early one-on-one
drills. Maurice Gordon, an end last year, was a great pass rusher in the
spring after moving inside and looks like he is ready to be a prime-time
player, particularly against passing teams.

Right End
Sophomore Kalen Thornton started the final nine games last year as a true
freshman and looks like he is ready to emerge as one of the top ends in the
Big 12. He was a freshman All-American last year. Senior Jermian Anderson is
his backup and is a good pass rusher.

Strongside Linebacker
Senior Lee Jackson, a former starting strong safety, is the starter and is a
sure tackler with the speed to blitz or cover tight ends or backs on pass
plays. He is backed by former starter Tyrone Jones, another senior.

Middle Linebacker
Senior De'Andre Lewis is a big, fast linebacker who has been a starter since
his redshirt freshman year. He is backed by redshirt freshman Austin
Sendlein, a tough run stopper.

Weakside Linebacker
Senior Everick Rawls has started since his sophomore year. He is a good run
stopper withe speed to blitz and help on pass coverage. With Boyd and Wilkins
helping at end, speedy true freshman Derrick Johnson will have an opportunity
to earn playing time.

Left Cornerback
Senior Quentin Jammer is rated by the pro scouts as the nation's top
cornerback prospect. He is big and fast, and, true to his name, is very good
at jamming receivers at the line of scrimmage. Senior Ervis Hill is a fine
backup.

Right Cornerback
Junior Roderick Babers started last year and is a strong cover corner with
excellent speed. Sophomore Nathan Vasher, who also is contending for a
starting safety job, is his backup.

Strong Safety
Vasher and fellow sophomore Dakarai Pearson are battle for the starting job.
Both are very talented.

Free Safety
Again, it is Vasher competing with senior Ahmad Brooks for the starting job.
Both are former cornerbacks with good speed and coverage skills.

SPECIAL TEAMS

Punter
Junior college transfer Brian Bradford is running ahead of redshirt freshman
Justin Smith. Both kick for good distance and get good hang time, but Bradfor
has been more consistent.

Placekicker
Two freshmen walk-ons - David Pino of Wichita Falls Rider and Dusty Mangum of
Mesquite - have both been impressive in the first week of drills. Both have
been accurate consistently up to 40 yards and both have had some success at
longer distances. Pino had scholarship offers from Nebraska and Tennessee and
actually committed to the Cornhuskers at one point before deciding to walk on
at Texas. If one of the walk-on freshmen can solidify this position, it will
really help the team's chances in close games.

SUMMARY
The Longhorn receiving corps, including the tight ends, is unequalled in the
country in terms of quality and quantity. The defensive backfield is very
good and will be one of the nation's best. At quarterback and in the
defensive line, the Longhorns are very talented. The offensive line is a
strong pass-blocking unit and is working on getting better at run blocking.
The linebackers, as a group, are solid. The question marks are at running
back and place kicker, and talented freshmen could answer both those needs.
This should be Mack Brown's best team at Texas.

Applewhite, Freshmen Receivers Lead Horns
To 52-10 Opening Win; UT No. 5 in AP Poll

The Longhorns opened their season at home Saturday by falling behind a
45-point underdog Louisiana-Lafayette team, but Major Applewhite came off t=
he
bench to spark a 31-point second quarter that paved the way for a 52-10
victory and a No. 5 ranking in the latest Associated Press Poll.
Heralded sophomore Chris Simms got the starting nod at quarterback over
Applewhite, who underwent off-season knee surgery after earning Big 12
Offensive Player of the Year honors in 1999.
But Simms had a rocky start, and when his sideline pass was intercepted and
returned for a touchdown that gave the Ragin' Cajuns a shocking 10-0 lead
with 1:27 left in the first quarter, the coaches turned to Applewhite to tr=
y
to pump some life into the dormant Longhorn offense.
And he delivered big time. He led the Longhorns to seven straight scores =
=01)
six touchdowns and a field goal =01) before retiring for the day and lettin=
g
Simms handle the mop-up duties.
For the day, Applewhite was 18 of 26 for 315 yards and four touchdowns =01)=
 and
that was in less than two quarters. He came in for the final 1:27 of the
first quarter, played all the second quarter and then left for keeps just
4:51 deep into the third quarter with the Longhorns on top, 45-10.
Coach Mack Brown still says the team has two first-team quarterbacks and he
still says he won't name a starter for the Stanford game, but there is litt=
le
doubt that the quarterback controversy is over and Applewhite is the starti=
ng
quarterback once again.
These coaches grade on performance and his scoring percentage Saturday was
perfect =01) seven possessions, seven scores that turned a 10-0 hole into a
45-10 romp when he left the game.
True freshmen wide receiver Roy Williams also had a big day. He caught six
passes for 105 yards, including a super one-handed grab for 40 yards to get
the Longhorns off their two-yard line.
Heading into this game, the Longhorns had four big questions, and three of
them got positive answers.
Unfortunately, the one that didn't get the positive answer was the key one.
Here are the questions, and the answers, at least for the short term:
1. Will the offensive line do a better job of blocking?
This is the one that didn't get the positive answer. It actually did a good
job of pass protecting, but the Longhorns couldn't run the football against=
 a
bad team that has small defensive linemen.
Unless the line improves and the Horns can run with some success, the good
defensive linemen will do just what our defensive linemen do against the
Oklahoma's of the world, which is pin their ears back and harass the
quarterback on every play.
2. Will those young wide receivers be able to pick up the slack for Kwame
Cavil, Ryan Nunez and Jeremy Jones, last year's big three?
Yes! Yes! Yes! Williams, B. J. Johnson and Sloan Thomas, the three heralded
true freshmen, combined to catch 11 passes for 182 yards, and another gjuy
seeing his first action, redshirt freshman Artie Ellis, tacked on four more
catches for 38 more yards and two touchdowns. As Darrell Royal used to say,
"if a dog will bite, he'll bite as a pup." These pups have big teeth and th=
ey
know how to use them.
3. Will the special teams be better?
They were Saturday. Brown said the kicking game "was the best since we've
been here," and that tells the story. Kris Stockton punted for a 48-yard
average, the kickoffs went team, and the Longhorn punt and kickoff returner=
s
got some positive yardage.
4. Will the young defensive ends be able to fill in for four-year starter
Aaron Humphrey and Cedric Woodard, a three-starter, first at tackle, then a=
t
end?
Sophomores Cole Pittman and Cory Redding, who was still bothered by a knee
sprain, and true freshman Kalen Thornton all played well, and junior Jermai=
n
Anderson, who is swift but undersized, did a good job of rushing the passer=
.
This is a Longhorn team with a lot going for it in terms of talent, coachin=
g
and a more favorable schedule, but the lack of a dependable running game
could prove fatal against a team that can pressure the quarterbacks.
Here, briefly, is how the game went:

FIRST QUARTER
With the temperature at 85 and rising, the Longhorns won the toss and
deferred The Cajuns ran the deep kickoff back to the 19, then drove 77 yard=
s
in 15 plays, using up nearly half of the first quarter, before stalling at
the Longhorn 4 and settling for a field goal to take a 3-0 lead with 7:55
left. Simms, getting the start over Applewhite at quarterback, led the Horn=
s
on a 40-yard drive that ended when Kris Stockton was wide on a 52-yard fiel=
d
goal try. The Cajuns couldn't move and had to punt, but Simms' third-down
pass was picked off by Terrance Hunter at the UT 43 and he dashed in for th=
e
score to give the 45-point underdog Cajuns a 10-0 lead with 1:27 left. Vict=
or
Ike ran the kickoff back to the 46 and Applewhite came in and  hit TB Hodge=
s
Mitchell for 17 yards, then found Williams twice, for 9 and 24 yards, to
reach the Cajun 4 as the quarter ended.

SECOND QUARTER
Mitchell darted over right tackle for four yards and the touchdown on the
first play of the quarter to get UT back in the game at 10-7. On the Horns'
remaining four possessions in the half, Applewhite swiftly moved them 80 an=
d
98 yards for touchdowns, nine yards for a field goal and 28 yards for a
touchdown after a Joe Walker interception. That 31-point explosion put Texa=
s
comfortably on top at 31-10 at intermission. In that decisive second quarte=
r,
Texas had 290 yards offensively and Louisiana had 77.

THIRD QUARTER
Ivan Williams ran the kickoff back to the UT 45 and Applewhite took Texas o=
n
two more quick scoring jaunts, first zipping 55 yards in five plays and the=
n
going 58 yards in four plays for two more TDs to push score to 45-10 and gi=
ve
him a perfect seven scores in seven tries. Simms relieved him at that point
and hit three straight passes to lead Texas to its final touchdown with 6:5=
3
left in the quarter. Neither team threatened serious for the remainder of t=
he
quarter.

FOURTH QUARTER
The Longhorns went back to trying to run the ball in the final quarter,
without much success. The Cajuns did have one late drive that got to the
Texas 16 before stalling, but that was the last serious drive by either tea=
m.

True Orange Observations

It was feast or famine for the Longhorns in the running game. Here's the ne=
t
gain on each running play in chronological order:
0, 12, 0, 11, 5, 3, 0, 4, 1, 9, 1, minus 1, 0, 0,28, 7, 0, minus 4, 2, 7, 1=
,
minus 5, 4, 2.
That is the primary reason Texas had the ball only 21:19 and Louisiana had =
it
38:41.
Most of the successful runs were draw plays. There were very few times when
normal running plays made any yardage.
In a 52-10 romp past an overmatched opponent, this is no big deal. But it
could cost the team two or three games down the line unless the regular
running plays start being more productive on a consistent basis.

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown says the Longhorns had to quit trying to run the ball
Saturday because Louisiana-Lafayette had "guys lined up in  every gap and
they blitzed on every play."
He said he really wanted to establish a running game early, but it was much
more sensible to go to an all-out passing attack because of the defense the
Ragin' Cajuns were playing.
Brown said, " I was surprised Major (Applewhite) was able to play as well a=
s
he did the first time back after knee surgery."
"Major played really well," he said. "The protection was great. The momentu=
m
really changed when we put Major in, but we also changed our offense and
starting putting four wide receivers out on every play."
He said Applewhite and Chris Simms, who started the game and played the fir=
st
two series before giving way to Applewhite, "are both starting quarterbacks=
.
"Chris had the great spring and he had an outstanding fall, but it wasn't
that Major got beaten out. We just think we have two starting quarterbacks.=
"
He also said, "You just as well not ask me about next week's starter becaus=
e
I'm not going to say."
I didn't know who it would be in the opener, but I'm betting on Applewhite =
to
get the nod Saturday night in Palo Alto against the dangerous Stanford
Cardinal because of his outstanding relief duty.
Brown said he was pleasantly surprised with the  way his young receivers
performed. "It's been a long time since I've seen freshmen play with
composure like that," he said.
Roy Williams became the first UT freshman ever to pick up a 100-yard
receiving game in his first start. He grabbed six passes for 105 yards,
including a spectacular one-handed catch on a 40-yarder from Applewhite.
"Roy really played well," Brown said. "One of the catches he made was
phenomenal."
Two other true freshman wide receivers =01) B. J. Johnson and Sloan Thomas =
=01)
also had outstanding debuts.
"B. J. made some great catches," Brown said, "and Sloan comes in, makes a
catch on the sideline, then makes two guys miss."
"I'm really pleased with the way the freshmen played," Brown said. "They ke=
pt
their poise and helped us win the game."
Artie Ellis, a redshirt freshman, also had a good day, catching four passes
for 38 yards, including two touchdowns.
Ellis was a smashing success during spring practice and was expected to mak=
e
a big impact this year because of his 6-4, 210-pound frame and good speed a=
nd
his ability to catch the ball in a crowd.
The four freshmen receivers accounted for 15 of the Longhorns' 25 reception=
s
and 220 of their 403 passing yards.
Little-used fifth-year senior Brandon Healy also made up for lost time, wit=
h
four catches, two of them for touchdowns, for a total of 88 yards.
Getting back to the quarterback duel, Brown said both players are handling
the situation well and "the team has confidence in both of them to get the
job done."
"We have to keep both of these quarterbacks upbeat," Brown said. "We'll nee=
d
both of them to accomplish the goals we have set."
He said he and offensive coordinator Greg Davis "talked to the guys long an=
d
hard about playing two quarterbacks."
"We will always talk to the players about the quarterback situation before
anyone else," he said. "We're not going to throw one in or out because of a
fan poll."
At his Sunday press conference, Brown said he was very pleased with the
team's first-down efficiency, offensively and defensively, and was happy
with the special teams' play.
Looking at the lack of run production, he said, "When you score 52 points,
it's not important, but, for the season, it is important."
He said the Longhorns will work hard on improving their running game this
week. "We have to do a better job on running the football," he said.
This was the fourth straight game in which the Horns had less than 100 yard=
s
rushing, but they lost the other three to end last season, so this time it
wasn't fatal.
Brown said Louisiana-Lafayette deserves a lot of credit for playing hard an=
d
he said Cajun QB Derek Dyer "played really great."
"But I thought our team was focused," he said. "Louisiana had nothing to
lose, but he had a lot to lose and nothing to gain."
He said all aspects of the kicking game pleased him Saturday. "The kicking
game was the best since we've been here," he said.


15 Freshmen Play

Fifteen freshmen played in Saturday's opening game.
Eight of them were true freshmen and seven were redshirt freshmen.
The eight true freshmen were WRs Roy Williams, B. J. Johnson and Sloan
Thomas, TE Brock Edwards, DE Kalen Thornton, DT Stevie Lee, CB Nathan Vashe=
r
and S Phillip Geiggar.
Williams, Johnson, Thornton and Lee played very early in the game.
The seven redshirt freshmen were WR Artie Ellis, RB Ivan Williams, FB Brett
Robin, OG Tillman Holloway, DT Marcus Tubbs, MLB Reed Boyd and S Dakarai
Pearson.
Holloway started due to weakened condition of Derrick Dockery, who was
hospitalized last week with an infected cyst.
Pearson also started because he is the nickel back and defensive coordinato=
r
Carl Reese came out with a five-defensive-back formation to start the game.
Ellis and Boyd also saw a lot of early action.
Inexperience at wide receiver was expected to be a problem for the Longhorn=
s
this season, but the trio of big, fast freshmen and Ellis combined Saturday
to show it as a team strength.
"Those guys don't play like freshmen," Applewhite said.

Scouting Stanford

The Longhorns face their first major test Saturday night when they play
defending Pac 10 champion Stanford in Palo Alto.
The game will start at 9:15 Texas time and will be televised by the Fox
Network.
Texas clobbered Stanford, 69-17, last year in Austin, and the Cardinal will
be trying to turn the tables this year.
Stanford went 8-4 overall last season and won the Pac 10 with a 7-1 record.
But all four of the seniors they lost on offense were first-team All-Pac-10
players. They included QB Todd Husak and WR Troy Walters, the league's
all-time leading receiver, plus two veteran offensive linemen
Six defensive starters return from last year, including four linemen. But
only one linebacker and one defensive back who started a year ago are on ha=
nd.
Stanford opened the season with a 24-10 victory over Washington State, and
the Cardinal defense did not allow an offensive touchdown, but then the
Cardinal fell to San Jose State, 40-27, Saturday night.
San Jose State beat Stanford with a powerful running game. Spartan TB Deonc=
e
Whitaker gained 254 yards on 21 carries, scoring on runs of 5 and 65 yards
and setting up two other TDs with long runs.
Stanford QB Randy Fasani threw for 361 yards and four touchdowns in the
offensive slugfest.
If the Longhorns are going to have a running game anytime soon, this will b=
e
their best chance to do it.
Texas probably will be at least a 10-point favorite, but this could be a
dangerous game unless the Longhorns tackle better than they did last week a=
nd
force a few turnovers.
The Horns also need to get their running game going or it will be one of
those four-hour, 100-pass shootouts.
Here are the three keys to victory, in my opinion:
1. Win the rushing battle. That doesn't sound like a big order against the
pass-happy Cardinal, but the Longhorns haven't had a 100-yard rushing game =
in
their last four outings.
2. Put a lot of pressure on Fasani and do a good job of protecting the Texa=
s
quarterbacks.
3. Take care of the ball. Texas needs to win the turnover battle.
I think this is a dangerous road trip, but I'll go out on a limb and pick t=
he
Longhorns to win by a 42-28 score. I think Texas will pressure Fasani and
take care of the ball. Hopefully, the Horns can run the ball, too, but two
out of three should be good enough.

Colorado fell to USC, 17-14.

Brown Says No True Freshman Likely to Start, But Several Will Play Early

Coach Mack Brown put the Longhorns through a tough 90-minute practice
Wednesday in the team's final full-scale workout before Saturday's 11:30
a.m.
opening game with Louisiana-Lafayette in Royal Memorial Stadium.
In answer to a question, he said, "We are not likely to start a (true)
freshman, but several of them will get into the game pretty quickly." WRs
Roy
Williams and B. J. Johnson, DE Kalen Thornton, DT Stevie Lee and CB Nathan
Vasher are the freshmen who are most likely to see quick action.
Brown said redshirt freshman Tillman Holloway probably will start at left
guard, but he said Derrick Dockery, who had been starting before missing
some
practice because of a large cyst, will play a lot, too.
Defensive coordinator Carl Reese said sophomore DE Cole Pittman "has been
playing really well. If he keeps playing like he has, we'll probably move
him
over to the other end as the starter and have Jermain Anderson be a swing
guy
who can substitute at either end.
Pittman has been backing up Cory Redding at right end. He might start at
right end Saturday because Redding also has missed some practice with a
knee
sprain. But Reese said Redding and Pittman "are my two best ends right now,
so  I might move Pittman. I'm still not happy with the end play, but we'll
keep working on it." Texas has nine defensive starters back, but the two
regulars who graduated were DEs Aaron Hmphrey and Cedric Woodard.
Brown said he is pleased with the team leadership on defense, and he said
the
offense "seems to be developing more leadership." He also said he is
pleased
with the way the team has worked in the record heat in Austin (110 on
Monday
and 112 on Tuesday, the two hottest days on record). "They have worked
really
hard," he said. "We've cut some of the workouts a little short because of
the
heat, but they are in fine shape."
It was a little cooler in Austin Wednesday, with the high around 100, and
it
is supposed to be in the mid-to-low 90s at kickoff time Saturday.
Brown also said the team is healthy with TE Bo Scaife and WR Jamel Thompson
the only players expected to miss the game. Scaife is out for the season
after undergoing knee surgery in late August, and Thompson will miss most
or
all of the season after undergoing knee surgery following spring practice.
Brown won't name his  QB. He says he doesn't even know yet. Most observers
think it will be Chris Simms, but I think it's 50-50 between Simms and
Major
Applewhite.

RECRUITING NOTES: I'm going to Houston Friday to see Galena Park North
Shore's game with Alief Hastings. North Shore has the state's top TE, James
Moses, and one of the top LBs, Jonathan Jackson. Both are strongly
considering Texas. I usually go to half of one game and then go to half of
another game, but with that 11:30 a.m. UT kickoff Saturday morning, I'll
probably just watch half of that game, then head back to Austin. I saw
North
Shore play last year, but I want to see how Moses and Jackson look as
seniors. I'll report on it in my next newsletter. . . The state's top
safety,
Dewayne Brandon of Temple, won't get much sleep Friday night either. His
team
is going to Brownwood for a game Friday night. He's going to get home about
1
or 2 o'clock in the morning, then says he will get up in time to make it to
Austin to the Texas game. "I want to see the Longhorns play," he said.
Asked
what schools he is considering, he said, "Texas, Florida State, Nebraska,
Michigan and Colorado are the main ones." . . . The state's top DT, Tommie
Harris of Killeen Ellison, also plans to come to the game, and DE Eric Hall
of Clarksville, Tenn., is coming Saturday for his official visit.
* * * *
BASEBALL RECRUITING  NOTES: The Longhorn  baseball coaches already have
commitments from four top baseball players. They are catcher Jack Sweeney,
6-2, 200, of powerhouse Houston Bellaire and three hard-throwing
right-handed
pitchers

-  Joey Guajardo, 6-0, 190, who threw three no-hitters as a junior
at Round Rock, and  Austin Westlake aces  Chaz Taylor, 6-3, 180, and,
Huston
Street, 5-11, 180. Street, who was 6-1, with a 1.27 ERA last season,  is
the
son of former UT football and baseball star James Street. Taylor pitched a
two-hitter this summer against the Dallas Mustangs, a powerful team that
included seven college players or signees, including Jason Stokes of
Coppell.
He struck Stokes out twice in that game. Stokes, a UT signee, signed a $2
million pro contract last week. Sweeney started 10 games as a freshman at
Bellaire and has been a starter ever since. He is the best defensive
catcher
in the country and also wields a powerful bat.

Dear Subscribers,

The trouble with having two computers is that I have the same things on both
of them, but I forgot to move my updated Blue Chip list over to the one I
used to send today's newsletter. That is an outdated list. Sorry about that.
You can discard that list because it is about two or three weeks old. The
list below is the bona fide, up to date, real Blue Chip list:

Practice Cut Short by Lightning; Haywood Undergoes Surgery
The Longhorns cut their practice short by about an hour Wednesday because
of
a thunderstorm with intermittent lightning that swept through Austin during
the late afternoon.
But coach Mack Brown said the team had a good workout, and he said the
coaches are working with the offense to try to iron out the wrinkles that
have caused the team to struggle in the first quarter this season.
He said the offense has been improving steadily since QB Major Applewhite
took back the starting job and the freshmen wide receivers began starting,
and he said the coaches have been telling the players a slow start could
prove fatal to the team's chances of winning Saturday night at Texas Tech.
* * * *
Longhorn athletic officials inquired about the possibility of moving the
time
of the Kansas game next week in Lawrence to make it available for pay per
view, but the move failed and it will be played as scheduled at 1 p.m. with
no TV.
Three Big 12 Conference games will be on TV on that date ? Oklahoma at
Texas
A&M (noon, ABC), Iowa State at Colorado (2:30, Big 12 network) and Nebraska
at Kansas State (6 p.m., FOX).
Can you believe TV nixed our game with Colorado to show A&M at Baylor and
is
now nixing out game at Kansas to show Iowa State at Colorado? There must be
more TV sets in Iowa and Colorado than I realized.
* * * *
INJURY UPDATE: Redshirt freshman DT Ryan Haywood underwent shoulder surgery
Wednesday and is out for the remainder of the season. Brown said Haywood
had
a high school shoulder injury that flared up again this year. He said the
surgery should eliminate the problem, and he said Haywood might be
available
for part or possibly all of spring practice. Brown also said true freshman
DT
Stevie Lee, who underwent surgery several weeks ago to repair a broken bone
in his foot, still can't run, and he said Lee might not be able to play
again
this year. If he doesn't play again, he will be eligible for a medical
redshirt year, which would leave him with four remaining years of
eligibility. Brown also said S Lee Jackson (quad) and WR Artie Ellis (shin)
will miss the Texas Tech game. He said LB O. J. McClintock, who underwent
arthroscopic knee surgery about a month ago, was able to work out Tuesday
and
Wednesday and probably will be able to play some at Lubbock. He said DT
Shaun
Rogers (ankle) and OG Antwan Kirk-Hughes (shoulder) probably will be able
to
play some at Tech, but he said neither is close to being 100%.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: OL Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter created quite a stir
earlier this week when he was quoted in the Dallas News as saying he
remains
committed to Texas, but might take a visit or two just to be sure of his
commitment. Brown generally sees a commitment as being binding on both
parties. He tells recruits when they are ready to commit that UT will
guarantee them scholarships, and they are supposed to guarantee they will
honor their commitments and refrain from visiting other schools. Scott has
talked off an on about visiting other schools, but he hasn't set up any
visits yet. I'll keep you posted if he does. . . Central Texas normally
doesn't have very many top recruits, but four of best in the state and in
the
nation his year are in Central Texas and three of them play in District
13-5A, which stretches from Waco in the north to Georgetown in the south.
They are DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison, LB Derrick Johnson  of Waco
and
DB Dewayne Brandon of Temple. The other top prospect is QB-Athlete Quan
Cosby
of Mart, who led his team to a 15-0 record and a Class 2A state title last
year. Texas is recruiting all four of them and has the lead with Johnson,
Brandon and Cosby. Harris has favored Texas when he lists a preference, but
he has been more noncommital about his college choice recently. I think,
Texas has a great chance to get all four of them and that would really put
t
he icing on an already outstanding recruiting class. Student Sports
magazine
currently has UT ranked No. 2 behind Michigan in the national recruiting
rankings.

Part 2

The Pre-Season Blue Chips

Here's my updated list of the top Texas football recruits. The ones in bold
type are my Fabulous 40. I have significantly upgraded kids who are drawing
heavy recruiting efforts from top Division I programs because the top D-1
coaches are the final judges of who's who in recruiting. They know more abo=
ut
it than anyone else. The ones who don't won't be around very long.

(Note to E-Mail Subscribers: I have put **** at each position category to
separate the Fabulous 40 players from the rest)

Basketball Team in Early NIT

The Texas basketball team will host Navy on Nov. 13 in the first round of t=
he
Preseason National Invitation Tournament. The starting time will be announc=
ed
later.
The winner of the Texas-Navy game will advance to play the winner of the
Mississippi State-California first-round contest in the second round on Nov=
.
15. The site for the second-round game has not been determined, but it will
start at 7 p.m. and will be televised nationally by ESPN2.
The field also includes four other teams who advanced to play in last
season's NCAA Tournament (Duke, Temple, Indiana and Pepperdine) and six
squads which played in last season's postseason NIT (New Mexico, California=
,
Princeton, Villanova, Marquette and Delaware).
The other teams selected for the 16th Preseason NIT are Fairfield,
Mississippi State, George Mason, Navy and South Alabama.
The semifinals and finals will again be played at Madison Square Garden in
New York City. The semifinal round is Nov. 22, with both games televised
nationally by ESPN. The third-place game and championship game are Nov. 24.
The championship game will also be televised nationally by ESPN. No game
times for the semifinals or finals have been announced.
This is Texas' third appearance in the Preseason NIT. The Longhorns lost at
Iowa State in the first round of the 1988 NIT and finished in fourth place
with a 2-2 record during the 1991 Preseason NIT.
The Longhorns concluded the 1999-2000 season with an overall mark of 24-9 a=
nd
advanced to the second round of the NCAA Tournament. They had a final AP
ranking of No. 15, which was the highest post-season ranking ever at UT.

Barnum Hopes Fade

The Longhorns' hopes of getting Greg Barnum, the great center prospect who
left Tennessee after his freshman year, are fading.
Vol coach Phil Fulmer has refused to give Barnum a release, which would for=
ce
him to pay his own way for a year if he comes to Texas as things now stand.
Since he would be a walkon, it also would require him to meet UT's transfer
guidelines for regular students.
As a regular student transer applicant with one year of college behind him,
he would have to have 24 hours of C grades or above to transfer to UT.
Under Fulmer, Tennessee football players have the worst graduation rate of
any of the major NCAA Division I powers.
Barnum was a good high school student who might have 24 hours of C or above
grades at Tennessee. If he does, he would certainly have been one of the to=
p
student-athletes on the Tennessee team.

UT Baseball Players Sign

The pros have signed three UT baseball juniors  =01) second baseman Tommy
Nicholson, relief ace Charlie Thames and shortstop Todd West =01) plus a to=
p
recruit in catcher Scott Heard of Rancho Bernardo, Cal.
Junior pitcher Phil Seibel is still negotiating with the pros, but has not
signed so far.

Basketball Recruiting

Guard Carlos Hurt of Alief Elsik has committed to Louisville.
The Longhorns were recruiting him, but their primary target for their only
remaining scholarship is 5-11 T. J. Ford,  who led Fort Bend Willowridge to
the Class 5A state title.
Ford, one of the nation's top point guards, is strongly considering the
Longhorns. But teams like Kentucky and Duke are also under strong
consideration.
Maurice Williams, a 6-1 point guard at Murrah High School in Jackson, Miss.=
,
also is considering Texas.
Williams and Ford are both rated among the top four point guards in the
country.
Texas already has a commitment from 6-10 center Chris Wright of Redwater.
With only two seniors on the team, coach Rick Barnes has only one more
scholarship to give unless some underclassmen leave the team.

Aldrich Makes Olympic Team

UT track and volleyball star Erin Aldrich made the U. S. Olympic Team Sunda=
y,
finishing second in the high jump with a 6-3 leap at the Olympic Trials in
California.
Aldrich was a senior last season, but she gave the Longhorns some good
publicity at the trials, wearing her UT track uniform.

How About Those Odds?

It's been so long since Texas has been a pre-season favorite in every
regular-season game that I frankly can't remember it. It probably was back =
in
the glory days of Darrell Royal.
But there is an early line from the Imperial Palace in Las Vegas that alrea=
dy
has posted early odds on three of the Longhorns' key games.
The Imperial Palace has the Longhorns favored by 7 points against Oklahoma =
in
Dallas, by 6 points against Colorado in Boulder and by 9.5 points against t=
he
Aggies in Austin.
I thought the Boulder game might be the only one this season where the Horn=
s
would rate as a pre-season underdog. I also thought the game against the
Sooners in Dallas was the second toughest game on the schedule, and the Agg=
ie
game was in the running for the third toughest test.
So, if Texas is a pre-season favorite in those three big games, I think I c=
an
guarantee you that when the Imperial Palace publishes the odds for the
remaining Longhorn games, UT will be favored in each of them.
That, of course, doesn't mean Texas will go undefeated, but I always prefer
to be favored and that's what the Longhorns will be heading into the season
in all 11 of its games.
If they stumble early, all that will change, so let's hope they don't stumb=
le
early =01) or at all.

The 90's - A Mixed Bag for Texas and Nebraska

The Longhorn football team has had a lot of success historically, but the
1990s weren't all that great.
Nebraska fans might disagree, however. The Huskers went 108-16-1 in the 90s=
.
That was the second highest win total ever recorded in a decade. Florida
State went 109-13-1 in the 90s to set the record.
But Nebraska went 1-3 against Texas in the 90s. If the Cornhuskers had won
any of those three games they lost to the Horns, they would have tied FSU f=
or=20
the most wins in a decade. If they had won two of them, they would hold the
record.

Baseball Recruit Shines

Vincent Sinisi, one of the Longhorns' prize baseball signees, led The
Woodlands to the Class 5A State Championship last month. He pitched a six-h=
it
11-1 victory over powerful Duncanville in the simfinals, then, after a
four-day rain delay, hit a two-out double in the sixth inning to score the
winning run over Corpus Chrisi Moody in a 3-2 championship game.
Speaking of baseball, the Longhorns have signed another lefthanded pitcher.
He is Brantley Jordan, 6-0, 190, of Texarkana JC and formerly of Round Rock=
.
He was 11-0 last season and he has two great pitches =01) a 90 mph fastball=
 and
a hard-breaking curve. He was a freshman at Texarkana, so he has three year=
s
of eligibility remaining.

Part 3 of 3

Horns Compete at NCAA Track

University of Texas senior Chris Hercules finished second in the triple jump
and sophomore Moushaumi Robinson placed third in the 400 meters and helped
UT's 1,600-meter relay finish second at the 2001 NCAA Outdoor Track and Field
Championships in Eugene, Oregon in early June.
 The Texas women finished 10th in the team standings with 25 points,
extending their streak of top-10 finishes under head coach Beverly Kearney to
eight consecutive years.
The Longhorn men finished 15th with 19 points, marking the program's sixth
top-15 finish in head coach Bubba Thornton's six-year tenure.
In the meet's final event, Robinson anchored UT's 1,600-meter relay to a
runner-up finish for the second consecutive year in 3:30.36. She was joined
on the relay by freshman Alyssa Aiken, senior Angel Patterson and freshman
Raasin McIntosh.
Senior Nicole Hoxie and sophomore Jermaine Cooper both picked up their first
individual All-America honors in their respective hurdle events.
Hoxie closed her Longhorn career by finishing sixth in the 100-meter hurdles
in 13.08, marking her fourth All-America performance overall.
In the 110-meter hurdles, Cooper picked up his first All-America certificate
by finishing fourth in 13.97.
Sophomore Erin Sims picked up her first All-America honor by finishing
seventh in the 1,500-meter final. Sims ran 4:22.98.
Patterson finished third in the 400-meter hurdles in 56.45.
The Texas men scored in the 400-meter relay for the first time since 1988
with their seventh-place effort. The crew of junior Amar Johnson, senior
Lawrence Armstrong, junior Michael Franklin  and junior Nathanael Esprit ran
a 40.05.
Freshman Dylan Armstrong broke his school record and became the first
Longhorn ever to earn All-America honors in the hammer throw when he finished
fifth with a toss of 227-11, topping his prior record of 227-4 set at the
Clyde Littlefield Texas Relays on April 5. He now owns the top five throws in
school history.
Thornton and Kearney both say they expect their teams to be better next year.
Both say they are awaiting some signed letters of intent, but say they have
some recruits who will help their teams.
Thornton also has an outstanding transfer in Tre Gardner, a sprinter-long
jumper who started out at Baylor.

Basketball Star Evans Turns Pro

Junior Longhorns swingman Maurice Evans, 6-5, 220, has hired an agent, thus
forfeiting his senior year of college eligibility.
Evans  led the Horns in scoring last year with a 15.6 average.
He said he is ready to give the NBA a try.

Barnes Hires Top Recruiter

Longhorn basketball coach Rick Barnes has hired South Carolina assistant
coach Frank Haith, 35, as his top assistant.
Haith has a reputation as an outstanding recruiter.
Haith, who went with coach Dave Odom to South Carolina in April after
assisting Odom for the last four years at Wake Forest, takes the job vacated
by Rob Lanier, who resigned to become head coach at Siena College.
While at Wake Forest, Haith was instrumental in leading the Demon Deacons to
four consecutive post-season tournament appearances, including an NCAA bert
last season.
He also was instrumental in helping Wake Forest sign one of the nation's Top
10 recruiting classes during the 1999-2000 campaign.
"In Frank Haith, we have hired one of the top assistant coaches in the
nation," Barnes said.
"He came very highly recommended from many of the high school coaches in the
state of Texas and around the nation. Frank also brings a great deal of
familiarity with coaching and recruiting in this area of the country. There
is no question that it is just a matter of time before he becomes a head
coach at this level."
Prior to joining the staff at Wake Forest, Haith served one year as the
associate head coach at Texas A&M (1996-97). He spent one season (1995-96) as
an assistant coach at Penn State, helping the Nittany Lions to a 21-7 overall
record.
But Barnes is still coach hunting because Ed Kohtala, who has been one of his
assistants  since he arrived at Texas three seasons ago, has been named head
coach at Alma College in Alma, Michigan. He is expected to name a replacement
in the next couple of weeks.

Assistant Golf Coach Named

UT head golf coach Susan Watkins has hired Shannon Fisher, a former TCU star,
as one of her assistant coaches
Fisher was a four-year letterwinner at TCU (1995-1999), where she led the
Horned Frogs to two appearances at the NCAA Championships in 1997 and 1999.
She is currently ranked 18th on TCU's Top 20 career scoring list with a
scoring average of 77.90 in 127 rounds played.
For the past year, Fisher, a native of Austin, has taught golf professionally
at the Austin Golf Club, where she served as the office manager and assistant
golf professional.
In 1999, she earned exempt status to compete on the SBC Futures Professional
Golf Tour.
"Shannon brings a new dynamic to our team," said Watkins, who led the
Longhorns to consecutive third-place showings at the last two NCAA
Championships. "She is a great teacher of the game and has a strong knowledge
of the top players in Texas."

Stephens Vying for Star Team

UT sophomore-to-be Stacy Stephens is one of 30 top players aged
19-and-younger competing at the USA Basketball Women's Junior National Team
Trials in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
Following the four-day trials, which end Monday, 12 players will be selected
for the 2001 USA Women's Junior World Championship Team.
Stephens, a 6-1, center-forward, was the first Longhorn freshman in 20 years
- and only the second rookie ever - to lead the 20-13  Longhorn squad in
both scoring (11 ppg) and rebounding (9.4 rpg).
In Big 12 Conference action, she averaged 10.9 points and 10.3 rebounds per
league game and was one of only three league players to average a
double-double in both scoring and rebounding.
In addition to her All-Big 12 honors, Stephens was named to the 2000-01
Women's Basketball News Service National All-Freshman Second Team and was
tabbed the Big 12 Freshman of the Year by both the Dallas Morning News and
the Austin American Statesman.
RECRUITING NOTES: The Longhorns are having their elite summer camp this
weekend and Chelsi Welch, the 5-9 sharpshooter who led Plainview to the state
Class 4A championship last spring, says she plans to come to the camp. One of
the state's top underclass players, 6-3 Tiffany Jackson, a junior to be at
Dallas Lincoln, also says she will be there. Four out-of-state girls who
range from 6-3 to 6-4 1/2, also are scheduled to attend. UT's biggest need in
its next recruiting class is a shooting guard and a big center.

A "Must Read" For All UT Exes!
The Burnt Orange Coffin
(Los Muertos No Hablan)
By Bill Holchak  BJ '49
It's recruit signing day, and the greatest high school player in the history
of Texas football is scheduled to make his official commitment to play for
the Burnt Orange. But the expected celebration at the UT  Ex-Students Center
in Austin turns into a wake when it is learned that the boy and his father
have been found murdered at their remote ranch home near the
headwaters of the Frio and Nueces Rivers in south Texas. Millionaire
playboy/detective Bill Chak volunteers his services without charge to his
alma mater to solve the mystery, and finds out that the trail soon leads far
beyond the borders of the Lone Star State.

Horns Sign Top JC Guard

Texas basketball coach Rick Barnes has signed 6-4 point guard Terrell Ross of
Allegany  JC in Cumberland, Maryland. Ross will have two years of eligibility
with the Longhorns.
"Terrell is a versatile player with good size who can help our backcourt play
in many ways," Barnes said.  "He handles the ball and sees the floor well,
can score and defend, and is a good worker."
"The most attractive thing about Terrell is that he comes from one of the
most storied junior college programs in the nation and received great
coaching while at Allegany," Barnes said.
Ross was the starting point guard for two years under coach Bob Kirk at
Allegany and he averaged 9.3 points, 7.7 assists and 6.3 rebounds per game
while earning first-team NJCAA (National Junior College Athletic Association)
Division I All-America and first-team All-Region XX honors during his
sophomore season.
He led the Trojans to a 32-3 record and a runner-up finish at the NJCAA
Division I Championship last season.
Ross converted 52.2% of his field goals, 33.8% (20-of-59) from three-point
range and he hit 74.3% (81-of-109) from the free throw line as a sophomore.
He joins fall signees T. J. Ford of Fort Bend Willowridge and Chris Wright of
Redwater. Ford is a 5-11 point guard and Wright is a 6-10 center.

Nordgren, State's Top QB, Picks Texas over LSU

Dallas Bishop Lynch QB Matt Nordgren, 6-5, 222, 4.6, is the Longhorns' 18th
commitment, and he said he came aboard this week to show his support for
the
UT coaches and to express his confidence in their ability.
Nordgren, the state's top quarterback prospect and one of the top 10
passers
in the country, chose Texas over LSU, Tennessee and Colorado. He also was
recruited by most of the top programs, but had narrowed his choices to
those
four schools. He told me had had 21 scholarship offers.
"It was really a close call between Texas and LSU," he said, "but I decided
I
wanted to play for the Longhorns."
He called me late Wednesday night to give me the news, but asked me to hold
it until around noon today.
He and Bishop Lynch coach Gary Oliver are going to announce Nordgren's
decision to sign with Texas at a pep rally at Bishop Lynch at 7 p.m. today.
Bishop Lynch is 6-0 and plays defending state TAPPs champion Houston Stake
Jesuit, also 6-0, this Friday.
"I just wnated to get it out of the way before our game and I wanted to let
the Texas coaches know," he said.
Oliver, who is a former wide receiver at Texas A&M, said Nordgren checked
out
a lot of schools before making his decision. "He is an outstanding
quarterback and an outstanding young man," Oliver said.
Nordgren is a 4.0 student who also is a 6-6 high-jumper and 39.5
intermediate
hurdler in track. He also starts for the basketball team.
"It came down to a great list of schools," Nordgren said, "but I felt at
home
at the UT campus. It's a football program that I know I can help lead to a
national championship."
* * * *
Redshirt freshman Dakarai Pearson will start at  safety Saturday, and Lee
Jackson will back up Pearson and fellow safety Greg Brown.
Defensive coordinator Carl Reese said freshman cornerback Nathan Vasher
will
be his nickel back Saturday.
DT Shaun Rogers practiced Wednesday and coach Mack Brown and Reese said
they
hope his sore ankle will allow him to play 15 to 20 plays Saturday.
Redshirt
freshman Marcus Tubbs will continue to start at right DT.
Brown also said sophomore LB O. J. McClintock under arthroscopic surger on
his right knee Tuesday and "he'll be out two to four weeks. It went well,
and
they think he'll have a quick rehab."
Brown also said true freshman Adam Doiron, who has not played this year,
probably  will play at DT at Colorado. Doiron, a high school DE, has been
working at DT, recently, and Brown said he is making good progress.
"With Shaun Rogers and Stevie Lee both out, we're a little thin at
defensive
tackle," Brown said. "We'll probably take the redshirt year away and play
Doiron Saturday.
He also said another true freshman who hasn't seen action, LB Austin
Sendlein, might have to play Saturday if any more linebackers are injured.
Brown said the team realizes it has a lot of work to do to get ready for
Colorado.

Football Practice Roundup

Coach Mack Brown put the Longhorns through a different kind of two-a-day
workouts this year and he and the players both think it is the way to go in
the future.
With the wave of football-related deaths hitting the pros, the colleges and
the high schools, he decided to only have one workout on days when the team
worked during the hottest time of the day.
A typical week of practice included 8:30 a.m. and 7 p.m. workouts on Monday,
Wednesday and Friday, and 3 p.m. workouts on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.
Brown said it kept the players fresher (and safer) and he also said they will
be better prepared to start the season.
"They handled the heat really well, and worked hard in every practice," he
said. "We've had some problems early in the season since I've been here, and
I think this kind of schedule gives us a better chance to be stronger at the
start of the season."
Brown had three game-type scrimmages during the pre-season work.
The final one went about 90 minutes last Wednesday night before about 4,000
fans and the first-team offense and first-team defense were dominant.
"The ones were dominant," Brown said, "and that's the way you want it. We ran
the ball well and threw it and caught it well, and we played good defense for
the most part."
The first-team defense had five QB sacks, with LBs Tyrone Jones and Everick
Rawls, DEs Kalen Thornton and Cory Redding and DT Maurice Gordon getting one
each.
Gordon got most of the first-team snaps at DT opposite Marcus Tubbs.
Brown said Tubbs has won a starting job, but the other DT spot is still up
for grabs.
Freshman Stevie Lee also looked good working with the second team at DT and
going against the first-team line. He appears to be recovered from off-season
foot surgery. He is a run stopped deluxe who is getting better at rushing the
passer.
Freshman RB Cedric Benson, running primarily with the second team, had his
best scrimmage. He gained 75 yards on 13 carries.
His was very impressive on a four-play 26-yard drive with the second team
against a mixture of first-and-second-team defenders.
He carried the ball four straight times, getting 6 and then 5 to set up a
first down at the 15, then bolting 14 yards on a draw play, breaking several
tackles along the way. He scored easily on the next play from the 1.
Benson seems to have better vision and be quicker through holes than the
other Longhorn backs. It also takes great penetration by the defense to keep
the heralded freshman from making positive yardage.
The Longhorns worked primarily on the running game in the final scrimmage.
Brown has said several times that UT must run the ball better in big games
and he said after the scrimmage he is encouraged by the way the backs are
running and the linement are blocking.
He was asked after the scrimmage why TE Bo Scaife has not been involved more
in the passing game. "We know Bo can catch and make things happen after he
catches it," Brown said. "We've been working Bo more on runs because he needs
to work on his blocking. That's the area where he needs to improve."
Brown also said at least three freshmen will play in the opener Sept. 1
against New Mexico State - Benson, outside linebacker Derrick Johnson and
walk-on kicker Dusty Mangum.
Asked why they are assured of playing, Brown laughed and said, "Cedric is
really, really productive. Derrick is 6-5, 215 and he runs really fast. Dusty
has been doing a good job in an area that was a problem for us in the
spring."
He also said Mangum will be the place-kicker and also might kick off.

Baseball Prospects Promising

The Longhorn baseball team begins fall workouts in September with most of its
top performers returning, plus a great group of new players.
Iowa State dropped baseball after last season and the Longhorns got the
Cyclones' ace pitcher, Alan Bomar, a hard-throwing right-hander who was one
of the top hurlers in the Big 12 last year.
They also signed two other pitchers who will compete for starting jobs. They
are Brad Halsey, a left-hander from Hill County JC who throws in the lows
90s, and Jesin Merrle, a right-hander from Navarro JC with a fine assortment
of pitches.
Five pitchers who saw a lot of action last year also return. They are Ray
Clark, Ryan France, Justin Simmons, Eugene Espineli and Bradley Jordan.
Ryan Hubele returns at catcher and Jeff Ontiveros will be at first base. Both
hit with power.
Speedy Timmy Moss is back at second base and prize freshman Michael Holliman
of Dallas Jesuit, who turned down a pro offer of more than $1 million to come
to Texas, probably will be at shortstop.
Omar Quintinilla, who suffered severe facial injuries in a collision with a
teammate last season, was having a great year at bat when the season-ending
injury occurred.
He played shortstop last year as a freshman, but will move to third base and
will add some pop to the batting lineup.
Another top middle infielder is Brandon Fahey, of Duncanville and Grayson
County JC. He is an outstanding hitter who could be the designated hitter if
he doesn't win a starting job.
Starting outfielders Ben King, Kaloni Napolean and Matt Rosenberg all return,
along with Eric Sultemeir, who played a lot as a freshman last season.
The Horns also added a top centerfielder in Joe Ferin of Westark JC. He was
All-Big 12 as a freshman at Iowa State in 1999 before transferring to Westark
for the 2000 season.
He has outstanding speed and is a fine hitter.
The Longhorns made it to the regional finals last year. With Quintinilla
returning healthy and the other returning starters, plus the influx of new
talent, this team has the potential to be much better.

Soccer Team Starts Strong

The Texas women's soccer team completed a 6-0-1 wing of Europe last week with
a 3-2 victory over Saestrum, the Dutch  League Champion, in Zeist, Utrecht,
NL.
The UT team, ranked No. 18 nationally, had three shutouts in the seven
matches and outscored their opponents by a 32-6 margin.
Leading the Longhornsoffensively in Europe were freshmen Kelly Wilson of
Odessa Permian and Kristen Teter of Kingwood, who finished the trip ranked 
first and second on the club,  respectively, in points scored with 14 and 12.
Wilson led the Horns with five goals and she and Teter tied for the team lead
in  assists with four.
Teter and sophomore Kylee Wosnuk of Folsom, California, tied for second on
the squad with four goals each during UT's European trip.
Up next, head coach Chris Petrucelli and theLonghorns officially kick off the
2001 campaign at 7 p.m. Friday at  Mike A. Myers Stadium and Soccer Field
against consensus No. 1 and  defending national champion North Carolina.
Tickets for individual matches are on sale through UTTM at (512) 477-6060 or
1-800-982-BEVO, while season tickets may be purchased by calling (512)
471-3333.

Freshmen Finish Strong; Varsity Reports Wednesday

The Longhorn freshmen practiced twice Tuesday, wrapping up their four
workouts as a group. The varsity players report Wednesday and the next
workout will involve the full team and will be Friday at 9 a.m. at Whitaker
Field (51st and Guadalupe).
Coach Mack Brown said he is very pleased with the freshmen, and he said at
least half of them probably will play this season.
He also released the official heights and weights on the freshmen. Here
they
are:
Trey Bates, 6-5, 285; Sneezy Beltran, 5-10, 205; Adam Doiron, 6-4, 260;
Brock
Edwards, 6-5, 265; Lionel Garr, 6-7, 335; Jason Glynn, 6-2, 275; Tony
Jeffery, 6-2, 170; B. J. Johnson, 6-1, 190; Will Matthews, 6-3, 235; Matt
McFadden, 5-11, 180; Chance Mock, 6-2, 205; Aurmon Satchell, 6-3, 220;
Austin
Sendlein, 6-3, 240; Justin Smith, 6-5, 185; Rashad Thomnas, 6-2, 235; Sloan
Thomas, 6-2, 195; Kalen Thornton, 6-3, 270; Nathan Vasher, 5-11, 170; Roy
Williams, 6-5, 210.
A couple of those heights and weights don't pass the eyeball test. Rashad
Thomas looks quite bit bigger than 235, and Roy Williams and Brock Edwards
appear to be closer to 6-3 or 6-4 than 6-5.
Johnson and Williams, the top receiving duo in the country last season
(both
were rated in the top 10 players overall by some services), both appeared
to
be fully recovered from injuries that hampered their workouts this simmer.
Johnson had a sprained ankle and Williams suffered a slight shoulder
separation in the Texas-California Shrine All-Star game.
Brown said Johnson appeared a little tentative in Monday's two workouts,
but
"he was going full speed today. I think he is totally well. And Roy
Williams'
shoulder isn't bothering him, either. Both of them appear to be totally
well."
TE Edwards, MLB Sendlein and DEs Doiron and Thornton are extremely quick
for
such big specimens.
Brown said QB Major Applewhite, who underwent knee surgery in the off
season,
has been cleared for contact and will work out with the rest of the team
Friday. he said WR Jamel Thompson, who suffered a knee injury in the spring
that required surgery, is the only player expected to miss the opening
practices. Thompson, a fifth-year senior backup, probably will get lost in
the shuffle if he does make it back by mid-season, because the heralded
freshmen WRs appear to be as good as advertised.
* * * *
FOOTBALL NOTES: Look for the Longhorns' base defense to be a nickel package
next season. Defensive coordinator Carl Reese said he plans to play a lot
of
nickel (five DBs) and dime (six DBs) this season. He said most of the teams
Texas plays are going to try to spread the field and play four wide
receivers
a lot. He said he will play four cornerbacks and two safeties when that
happens, with the four down linemen and middle linebacker also staying in
the
game. Reese likes MLB De'Andre Lewis and WLB Everick Rawls , but he said
unless Tyrone Jones or Marcus Wilkins steps up at SLB, "we'll be a little
more of a nickle team, because the SAM (strongside linebacker) is the one
who
comes out when we put another cornerback in." Reese also said he will use a
dime package when teams line up with four wideouts. He said the four
cornerbacks will play man for man against the wide receivers and the two
safeties "will line up in the box (close to the line of scrimmage)."
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: Bret Rawls, the 6-5, 195-pound former wide receiver who
will succeed superstar Brock Berlin as the QB in the high octane Shreveport
Evangel offense, seems to be leaning Texas' way after earlier appearing to
be
a lock for LSU. He says he really likes the Texas offense. Since the
Longhorns only plan to take one QB and they are in one two very good ones

-
Rawls and Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch
- the scholarship appears
likely to go to the first one who says he is ready to commit.  Both came to
Texas summer camp. The Longhorns still have 12 early commitments.

No shame on me, I did try to e-mail you!  Glad things are going good for
you.  Smart move with the girlfriend, you both need your own space.
I'm busy as ever!  Can't remember if I told you, I'm the CAD Manager now.  I
like it okay, it's just hard to juggle those full-time responsibilities and
go to school three nights a week too.  Only 2 weeks left though and I'm
finished until fall.  I wish I was finished for good, but that will take a
few years.

It was good to hear from you!
Keep in touch!
when are coming to town?

Take care!
Melissa

Melissa,

I have changed jobs.  I now work for Enron.  My new email address is
clint.dean@enron.com.  I left my old job on March 31, so if you've tried to
get a hold of me, that's why I haven't responded.  If you haven't tried to
get a hold of me, then shame on you.  Anyway, things seem to be going good.
My girlfriend is graduating in May and moving to Houston to start her new
job at Conoco.  No, we will not be living together.  We figured we ought to
ease into things, since we haven't lived in the same city for awhile.
Besides, she needs to be out on her own for a little while.  Remember that
car I had when you last saw me at Amy's wedding, well I was able to pay it
off the other day.  I'm feeling pretty cool now.  That's about it from
here.

Clint

Longhorns Get Pledge from Killeen Ellison Linebacker

Yamil LaBron, 6-2, 240, 4.7, a middle linebacker from Killeen Ellison,
announced his commitment to Texas Monday, giving the Longhorns nine early
commitments. The Horns had pulled a big surprise earlier Monday, getting
Mike
Garcia, a big offensive lineman from Galena Park, to switch from A&M to
Texas.
LaBron and  Garcia were the seventh and  eighth high school players to
commit
to Texas this month. In addition, Alfio Randall, a star OT at Blinn JC,
says
he will come to Texas in January after he graduates from Blinn.
The other high school players who have committed to Texas are OLs Jonathan
Scott of Dallas Carter, Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village, Roman
Reeves
of Livingston and Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls and DBs Braden
Johnson
of Euless Trinity and Brian Carter of The Woodlands.
"I went to the Texas camp two weeks ago and they offered me a scholarship,"
LaBron said Monday night. "I verbally committed to them when I met with the
coaches with my dad. I'm waiting for my mom to come home from Puerto Rico
so
she can talk to them, too. To tell you the truth, I'm going there anyway.
I'm
going to be a Longhorn."
* * * *
I talked to Chris Hill, Roy Williams' mother, tonight and she said the
shoulder injury Roy suffered on the opening kickoff of the Texas-California
All-Star game Saturday night, involves stretched ligaments and she said the
doctors say it will heal on it own. California won the game, 29-27, on a
53-yard FG on the final play.
"He's in a lot of pain," she said. "It's very sore. We took him to a
specialist and the examination showed stretched ligaments in the shoulder.
The specialist said it should heal on its own in a few weeks."
She also said the doctor said he should be fully recovered by the time the
freshmen report at Texas in mid-August.
Williams, a great wide receiver prospect from Odessa Permian,is one of the
top Longhorn recruits. He is 6-3, weighs 208 pounds and he ran a 10.03 100
meters last track season. He also high jumped 7-0 and he set a state record
in the broad jump at the state meet with a  25-6 leap.
Sloan Thomas of Klein, another of the outstanding WR recruits Texas signed
in
February, caught five passes in the second half and was one of the key
players who led the Texas team's comeback from a 26-7 deficit. He caught
one
touchdown pass and set up two others with outstanding catches in heavy
traffic. On the two great catches in traffic, he was behind the secondary,
but had to come back because the balls were underthrown. He ran a 10.38 100
meters his junior year and, like Williams, has a great combination of size
and speed. He is 6-2 and weighs almost 200 pounds.
DE Kalen Thornton of Dallas St. Mark's, another UT signee, split time at
end
and tackle and was outstanding at both. He had two sacks and consistently
put
pressure on the California quarterbacks.
C Jason Glynn and DT Sonny Davis, the other two UT signees who played in
the
game, also looked good when they got to play. Glynn opened some good holes
on
the late scoring drive that put Texas ahead, 27-26, with just 17 seconds
left. Davis appeared to be carrying a little excess weight, but he was able
to push the Cal blockers back into the backfield at times.
This was the second straight year California has won the game in the final
seconds.
B. J. Johnson, the nation's No. 1 WR recruit and another Texas signee,
sprained an ankle a week before the game and was not able to play. He said
the ankle sprain is mild and won't hamper his ability to be in good shape
for
the start of workouts at UT in less than seven weeks.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: DT Tommie Harris, LeBron's teammate at Killeen Ellison,
says Texas and Florida State are his top two teams right now, followed by
A&M,
Miami and UCLA. Harris  probably is the nation's top DT recruit, and he is
a
good friend of Greg Barnum, the center who quit the Tennessee team several
weeks ago and is considering transferring to Texas to continue his football
career.

Brown Says Horns Were Overrated in Early Season, But Now Playing Well

Coach Mack Brown said Wednesday the Longhorns were ranked too high to start
the season and didn't begin playing well until after the big loss to
Oklahoma, but he says they now have a good team and have a chance to go to
a
good bowl game.
Texas, now ranked No. 14, was No. 7 to start the season. "We were way too
over-rated in the pre-season," he said. "Alabama was third and their coach
got fired and they've won three games. The pre-season polls are way
overrated."
He said he didn't feel like the Longhorns played as a team early in the
season. "but the last five weeks, we have played as a team. We have matured
as a team."
The Longhorns will practice again  Thursday, then take off Friday, Saturday
and Sunday before returning to work Monday in preparation for the Friday
game
against A&M.
* * * *
Brown said the players who were unable to practice Tuesday weren't able to
practice Wednesday. He said safety Greg Brown and TE Brock Edwards, both
battling leg injuries, are questionable for the Texas A&M game. He said QB
Major Applewhite is continuing to rehabilitate his knee sprain, and will be
re-evaluated Monday by the doctors.
Asked if he thinks Applewhite will be able to play against A&M, he said, "I
really don't have any idea until the doctors look at him Monday."
* * * *
Defensive coordinator Carl Reese said said it will be important for the UT
defense to get off to a fast start against Texas A&M. "We have been playing
pretty well, but we've given up too many early drives," he said. " We need
to
get a good start against Texas A&M because we can't afford to give them
anything early."
He said the Aggies present a problem because they have the ability to run
and
throw. "We'll set out to stop the run because that's what we do," he said.
"You have to stop the run, but we'll also have to be very aware that they
can
hurt us with the pass, too."
Reese also said he is pleased with the depth he has on defense this year.
He
said his backup linemen, linebackers and defensive backs have all been
playing at a high level.
* * * *
DT Shaun Rogers, who has been slowed the last month by a badly sprained
ankle, said it is feeling much better. "It's better than it has been since
I
injured it," he said.
* * * *
FOOTBALL RECRUITING NOTES: Super DT Tommy Harris of Killeen Ellison has
changed his mind again and says he will take an official visit to Texas in
January. He said he had talked with the Texas coaches and has decided to
take
an official visit. His teammate, LB Yamil Lebron, a UT pledge, also says he
does not plan to take any visits to other schools. He had been quoted
earlier
as saying he would visit Oklahoma with Harris, but he said he is a firm
commitment to Texas and won't be traveling with Harris. . . Super LB
Derrick
Johnson of Waco says Texas is No. 1 with him. Johnson is as good an outside
linebacker prospect as I have seen in Texas in several years. He has
defensive back speed and a linebacker frame at about 6-3 or 6-4 and 205
pounds.
* * * *
BASKETBALL NOTES: The Longhorns scored the last six points to come from
behind and defeat California, 57-54, in the second round of the Preseason
NIT
in a real defensive struggle in Austin. The victory propels the Horns into
the semifinals of the tournament and they will play next Wednesday in New
York's famed Madison Square Garden, probably against Duke. . . Defending
Class 5A champ Fort Bend Willowridge opened its season Tuesday with an
83-53
win over Hastings and point guard T. J. Ford, a UT signee, had 14 points
and
dominated the game with his pin-point passes. . . Super 6-7 sophomore
Kendrick Perkins had 18 points, 15 rebounds and seven blocked shots to lead
Beaumont Ozen to a 79-52 win over Heritage Christian.

B. J. Johnson Has Big Day; Brown, Reese Like Backup Linebackers

B. J. Johnson joined Roy Williams as a freshman wide receiver sensation
Monday, making one truly sensational catch between veterans DBs Ervis Hill
and Joe Walker and making several other dazzling catches and moves.
Johnson and Williams were both ranked among the nation's top five wide
receiver recruits last year, and both have shown they certainly deserve all
the attention that came their way.
Johnson's great catch was on a long pass from QB Major Applewhite that he
managed to take away from the two defensive backs. He appears to be fully
recovered from a bad ankle sprain that hampered his summer workouts, and
he,
like Williams, looks ready to do some damage as early as the Sept. 9 opener
against Louisiana-Lafayette.
Freshman TE Brock Edwards also continues to improve on a daily basis and he
shows enough speed that the coaches hope he can fill the role they had
envisioned for sophomore Bo Scaife, who suffered a season-ending knee
injury
the first day of practice.
* * * *
Coach Mack Brown said he really likes the way backup linebackers Reed Boyd
and O. J. McClintock are playing this fall, and he said he thinks they will
be able to give starters De'Andre Lewis and Everick Rawls a rest during the
season. "We'd like to get about 20 plays a game from them, and that would
let
D. D. and Everick  rest."
Brown said he intends to play backups a lot more this season than he has in
the past. "We have more depth at more positions this year," he said. "You
need to rest your starters at times, and we think we have enough quality
depth to do that."
Defensive coordinator Carl Reese also said he likes the way Boyd and
McClintock are playing. He said they are particularly good as pass
defenders.
McClintock has had three interceptions during the first week of practice,
and
Boyd has knocked down several passes. He also praised the way Cole Pitttman
has played at DE since moving from DT. He said Pittman and Maurice Gordon
at
pushing starter Jermain Anderson.
* * * *
One-on-one blocking drills between the fullbacks and linebackers Monday
showed clearly why Matt Trissel is the starting fullback and Brett Robin is
running No. 2. They are head and shoulders above the other fullbacks at
stopping a hard-charging linebacker. Freshman Will Matthews also excels at
times, but he lacks consistency. He looks like a budding fullback star,
however.
* * * *
The Longhorns' practice schedule has changed slightly, so here is for the
remainder of the open practices (all practices are at Whitaker Field at
51st
and Guadalupe unless other noted):
Tuesday, Aug. 22, 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. (the 5 p.m. practice will be the first
one in full pads)
Wednesday, Aug. 23, 9 a.m. and a 5 p.m. scrimmage at Royal Memorial Stadium
Thursday, Aug. 24, 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.
Friday, Aug. 25, 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.
Saturday, Aug. 26, 9 a.m. scrimmage at Royal Memorial Stadium, 5 p.m.
practice at Whitaker
Sunday, Aug. 27, Fan Appreciation Day at 2 p.m. at Royal Memorial Stadium
Monday, Aug. 28, 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.
Tuesday, Aug. 29, 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.
Wednesday, Aug. 30, scrimmage at 6 p.m. at Royal Memorial Stadium (first
day
of classes)
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: College coaches can start calling players once per week
on
September 1, but they can't go to any games to scout players until October
1.
Look for one of their first stops in October to be at Shreveport Evangel,
where Bret Rawls, a transplanted wide receiver, gets his first start at
quarterback. Rawls was sensational at several summer camps, including the
one
at UT, but all the college coaches are going to want to see how he performs
in games. Rawls already is on several national 100 lists based on his
athletic ability and the way he performed in those summer camps. He likes
the
Longhorns.

Roy Williams Stars Again; Brown Says Scaife Upbeat

This may sound like a repeat of an earlier fax, but freshman WR Roy
Williams
caught so many long passes Saturday that I lost count. Williams is so big
and
fast and smooth that he makes difficult catches look surprisingly easy.
I talked to one veteran Longhorn coach who told me Williams is easily the
best freshman wide receiver he has ever coached or seen. "He's kind of a
combination of Mike Williams and Lovell Pinkney," the coach said. "He's
even
faster than Mike, he's nearly as tall as Lovell and he catches the ball
better than either of them."
Freshmen receivers normally need some time to adjust to the way DBs jam
them
at the line of scrimmage, but Williams just runs through jams, then outruns
or outjumps whichever veteran DB has the misfortune to be trying to cover
him.
Coach Mack Brown said some of the veteran defensive backs came out to watch
the freshmen practice before the varsity checked in and saw Williams
running
wild, and some of the other freshman WRs looking very good, too. "Some of
those defensive guys said things were going to change when they get with
us,"
Brown said, then added with a chuckle, "but it hasn't changed much. They
(the
freshmen WRs) still look pretty good."
Sloan Thomas, B. J. Johnson and Tony Jeffery are the other three freshmen
WRs, and they also are making strong bids for playing time, but there is no
question that, right now, Williams is the brightest of the young star
receivers.
In addition to outstanding size, speed and body control, he makes quick
adjustment while the ball is in the air to get in just the right position
to
make the catch. If you haven't been to a Longhorn practice, you should come
to one just to see Williams in action.
Brown said there is a very good chance that all four of the freshmen WRs
will
play this year. "The thing we are going to try to do is win," he said. "If
they can help us win, they'll play, and they are looking pretty good right
now."
* * * *
Brown said sophomore TE Bo Scaife is reasonably upbeat about the
season-ending knee injury he suffered Friday about one hour deep into the
first varsity practice. "He said it was great that he played last year, so
he
can count this as his redshirt year," Brown said.
Brown also said the doctors said the injury is not as severe as the one
Scaife suffered to his other knee in high school.
* * * *
FOOTBALL NOTES: Kris Stockton is the starting punter and place kicker right
now. . . Brown said the team goal is to average 38 yards in net punting
this
season, which would be about nine yards better than the average last
season.
. . QB Major Applewhite still isn't showing any ill effects of off-season
knee surgery. . . Backup LB O. J. McClintock has intercepted two passes
during the two days of varsity practices. . . Freshman Stevie Lee and
redshirt freshman Marcus Tubbs are backing up star senior DTs Casey Hampton
and Shaun Rogers, and defensive coordinator Carl Reese says he expects big
things out of the two youngsters this season. . . Brown said Chad Stevens,
a
former tight end, will stay at fullback "because we're going to move our
fullback up to a tight end spot at times to have a two-tight-end look."
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: The Longhorns' 12 early commitments include two players
who
are on almost all of the national top 100 lists

- OLs Jonathan Scott of
Dallas Carter and Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village
- and another who
was on all the lists two years ago
- OL Alfio Randall of Blinn JC. UT also is
in great shape with  five other players who are on most national top 100
lists
- QB Brett Rawls of Shreveport Evangel, RB Cedric Benson of Midland, DT
Tommie Harris of Killeen Elllison, LB Derrick Johnson of Waco and S DeWayne
Brandon of Temple. DE Eric Hall of Clarksville, Tenn., is on several
national
top 100 lists, and he is a strong Texas lean.

Part 2 of 3 Parts

Recruiting Enters New Phase Saturday

College coaches get to start calling recruits again Saturday after a layoff
of more than three months, and that usually means good things will start to
happen again  for the Longhorns.
Coach Mack Brown and his staff have revolutionized recruiting in Texas with
the their early commitment blitz, and it worked again this year with an even
dozen early pleges by August 2, including six who have been mentioned on one
or more national top 100 lists.
There haven't been any new ones since DT Tully Janszen of Keller picked Texas
over Oklahoma and Texas A&M back on August 2.
Under NCAA rules, college coaches get to call each recruit one time in May,
then they get to start calling them once a week on September 1, which is this
Saturday.
Those weekly calls probably will produce at least one or two more commitments
in September.
WR Marquis Johnson of Champaign, Ill., had planned to come to New Mexico
State season opener, and he had said there was a good chance he would commit
on his visit.
He still strongly favors the Longhorns, but wants to take his official visit
before committing.
One important thing to note here is that out-of-state kids can take official
visits during the football season. Texas kids cannot take official visits
because the University Interscholastic League, the governing body for high
school sports in Texas, has ruled that any player who takes an expense-paid
trip prior to the conclusion of football season loses his eligibility for
that season.
That means the only kids making official visits to Texas and other in-state
schools in September, October or early November will be from other states.
The Longhorns will have a lot of fine high school prospects as their guests
at the New Mexico State game, but they will be in Austin unofficially, which
means UT can give them a ticket and they have to pay for everything else,
including their transportation, food and lodging.
Here are the Longhorns' 12 early commitments:
Quarterbacks (1)
Billy Don Malone, 6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7, Paris North Lamar
Tight Ends (1)
David Thomas, 6-3, 210, 4.55, Wolfforth Frenship
Wide Receivers (1)
Dustin Miksch, 6-0, 167, 4.35, Round Rock Westwood
Offensive Linemen (2)
Brett Valdez, 6-4, 310, 5.2, Brownwood
Neale Tweedie, 6-5, 255, 4.9, Allen
Defensive Linemen (4)
Sonny Davis, 6-1, 320, 5.0, Austin Lanier  and Gulf Coast, Miss., JC
Earl Anderson, 6-3, 265, 4.8, San Marcos
Lyle Sendlein, 6-4, 260, 4.8, Scottsdale Chaparral
Tully Jantzen, 6-4, 255, 4.8, Keller
Linebackers (2)
Brian Robison, 6-3, 243, 4.6, Splendora
Marcus Myers, 6-3, 220, 4.5 Pflugerville Connally
Athletes (1)
Clint Haney, 5-11, 185, 4.27, Smithson Valley
* * * *
The Longhorns probably won't get another quarterback. Vincent Young, the
great prospect at  Houston Madison, says he is going to go out of state.
The only running back still on the UT radar screen is Albert Hardy of Galena
Park, the state's top back.
At tight end, Texas is still trying to get Eric Winston of Midland Lee, but
he comes from Aggie stock and is a long shot.
The Longhorns hope to get two more wide receivers, headed by Marquis Johnson
and then probably Biren Ealy of Cypress Falls.
Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus is the state's most talented wideout,
but he is serving a three-week suspension to start the season and he played
only two games last year because of eligibility problems arising from
switching schools.
A wild card here is DaBryan Blanton, the small but lightning fast running
back from Forney.  He could be a wide receiver in college. Texas is
recruiting him.
Texas is still recruiting two offensive line prospects and probably will try
to sign both Justin Blalock of Plano East and Tony Ugoh of Spring Westfield.
The defensive line crop is loaded this year, and Texas is trying to sign DEs
Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel, Bryan Pickryl of Jenks, Okla., Travis
Leitko of The Woodlands, Larry Dibbles of Lancaster and Dontriel Coates of
Anahuac.
The Horns won't get all of them, of course, but they hope to get several of
them.
The North Carolina game on Sept. 8 has been dedicated to the memory of Cole
Pittman, Chase Pittman's brother who was killed in a tragic automobile
accident while returning to UT in February. He was a promising sophomore DT.
The situation at DT is much like the one at DE. Roderique Wright of Alief
Hastings, Marco Martin of Mesquite, Joseph Edwards of Dayton, Tuaren Brown of
Katy Cinco Ranch, Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch, Colo., and Loren Howard
of Scottsdale, Ariz., are all being recruited, and, hopefully, at least two
or three of them will sign with Texas.
At linebacker, outstanding middle backer Aaron Harris of Mesquite and speedy
outside backers Garnett Smith of Arlington Lamar and Glenn Jackson of
Carrollton Turner are the main hopes.
Texas probably will try to sign one or two defensive backs and the top one
who is considering the Horns is Ricky Wilson of Port Arthur Lincoln.
Speedy Edorian McCullough of North Garland would be a fine cornerback, but he
wants to be a running back. He likes Oklahoma and Texas.
RECRUITING NOTES: LeKeldrick Bridges of Dallas Hillcrest, one of the state's
top athletes, has given up football to concentrate on basketball, so he will
be disappearing from all the football prospect lists, including mine. . . The
strength of the this year's recruiting class statewide is in the defensive
line. There are more outstanding defensive linemen in the state than in any
other year since I've been doing this.

Injury Update

Senior starting LB Lee Jackson has a turf toe and probably will miss the
opener, with Tyrone Jones replacing him. Jackson is expected back for the
second game, but toe injuries sometimes are tough to shake off.
Junior DE O. J. McClintock is out indefinitely after suffering severe hand
and arm cuts in a household accident. The coaches hope he'll be back by
mid-season.
Junior WR Kyle Shanahan, a walk-on who is one of the Longhorns top four
receivers, is still recovering from a puncture wound in his leg. He tried to
jump a fence and didn't make it. He will miss the opener, but might be back
for the second game.

Horns on Short List
Five Longhorn football players - senior OT Mike Williams, junior DE Cory
Redding, senior CB Quentin Jammer, senior MLB De'Andre Lewis and junior QB
Chris Simms - have been named to the watch lists for three of the nation's
most prestigious post-season awards.
Williams and Redding were named to the Rotary Lombardi Award Watch List,
Jammer was tabbed for the Jim Thorpe Award Watch List. Lewis was selected for
the Dick Butkus Award Watch List and Simms was chosen to the Davey O'Brien
National Quarterback Award Watch List.
Established in 1970, the Lombardi Award honors the nation's outstanding
linemanwho best exemplifies the character and discipline of  Vince Lombardi,
the legendary head coach of the Green Bay Packers.
Established in 1986, the Thorpe Award honors the nation's outstanding
defensive back. The award is named after the legendary Jim Thorpe, who was a
first-team Walter Camp Football Foundation All-American in 1911 and '12.
Thorpe also won gold medals in the pentathlon and decathlon at the 1912
Summer Olympics, played professional baseball and was elected the first
president of what would later become the National Football League in 1920.
The Butkus Award goes to the nation's top linebacker and is named for former
University of Illinois and NFL Hall of Famer Dick Butkus.
Simms was named as one of 30 candidates for the O'Brien award.
The O'Brien Award is named in honor of the late Davey O'Brien, the
All-American and Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback for TCU in the late 1930s.

Hayter Will Transfer

Junior RB Kenny Hayter plans to transfer to another school to try to get more
playing time. he has been granted a release.
With backup DE Adam McConathy transferring earlier and two freshmen, CB Adam
Ross of Tyler and LB Yamil LeBron of Killeen Ellison, failing to enroll for
academic reasons, the Longhorns are down to 79 scholarship players.
Ross was practicing with the team last week when it was determined that he
had problems with the NCAA Clearinghouse. He plans to return in January.
LeBron says he will attend junior college and then return to Texas.

Horns Bound for Holiday Bowl to Face Oregon or Oregon State

The Longhorns accepted a bid Wednesday to play in the Friday, Dec. 29,
Culligan Holiday Bowl in San Diego, and their opponent will be either
Oregon
or Oregon State. Both Oregon teams shared the Pac 10 title with Washington,

which is playing Purdue in the Rose Bowl.
Oregon State, 10-1, will be the Longhorns' opponent unless the Beavers get
a
berth in one of the BCS bowls, probably the Fiesta. If OSU gets a Fiesta
bid,
then Texas would play Oregon, 9-2.
The Holiday Bowl kickoff will be at 7:30 p.m. Texas time.
Longhorn fans can purchase tickets by calling the UT Ticket Office at
1-800-982-BEVO or local fans can call 471-3333. If anyone wants to buy
tickets in person, the ticket office is located on the first floor in
Bellmont Hall.
Coach Mack Brown said the Longhorns are "excited about accepting this
invitation" and he said they are also excited about playing either of the
Oregon teams, because both are ranked in the top 10.
Brown also said the game should help Texas' recruiting efforts in
California
and throughout the Pac 10 area because of its location and he also said it
should help recruiting nationally because it is "a nationally televised
(ESPN) game that does not compete with any other game that evening."
Brown said the Longhorns will resume practice on Dec. 13, but he said some
of
the coaches will work with some of  the players next week. Most of the
coaches are on the road recruiting this week and many of them will be out
again next week.
"Recruiting is our top priority right now," Brown said.
* * * *
Offensive coordinator Greg Davis said QB Major Applewhite should be close
to
100% by Dec. 29, but neither he nor Brown would indicate whether Applewhite

will get his starting job back or if the nod will go to sophomore Chris
Simms, who was sensational in leading the Longhorns to a 43-17 win over
arch-rival Texas A&M last Friday.
My crystal ball tells me it will be Simms because (a) he had a great game
in
his last outing, and (b) he is completely healthy, while there will be some

questions about Applewhite's sore knee until he actually takes a lick on
it.
I also think the coaches would feel more comfortable with the idea of
Applewhite relieving Simms if Simms had problems than they would be with
Simms handling the pinch-hitting role.
* * * *
FOOTBALL NOTES: Brown said he will use the bowl practices to take a closer
look at several of the freshman who have been redshirted. He said he
usually
watches them during the season, but said so many of the freshmen were
playing
regularly that the coaches were spending an abnormal amount of time getting

them ready, which  prevented him from seeing as much of the redshirts as he

would have liked. He said FB Will Matthews and TB Sneezy Beltran are two
freshmen he wants to take a good look at to see if they can help the team
next year.
Both Matthews and Beltran have been very impressive on the scout team, and
Brown is looking for a TB to replace senior Hodges Mitchell and he also
wants
to give Matthews a  shot at competing with FB Matt Trissel.
* * * *
FOOTBALL RECRUITING NOTES: The private schools in Texas generally aren't
the
ones who produce top talent for the colleges, but two  freshmen, TE Brock
Edwards of Fort Worth Christian and DE Kalen Thornton of Dallas St. Marks,
started several games for Texas this year. There are some top seniors at
the
private schools again this year, headed by DT Thomas Derricks of Dallas
Jesuit. There also is a junior QB at Midland Christian who will be hearing
from some of the top colleges next year. He is Jamie Beeghley, 6-2, 190,
4.55. He led Midland Christian to the state title last week and hit 14 of
19
passes for 195 yards and ran for 112 more yards in the championship game
victory over Fort Worth Christian. . . This year was the year of the
offensive linemen, which was great for the Longhorns because they needed to

sign five or six really good ones and they already have  been assured of
filling that need. Next year probably will be the year of the defensive
linemen, and that is very good for Texas because the Horns need to sign a
bunch of them. I've already seen four or five who would be top recruits
this
year if they were seniors. I mentioned several of them in my last
e-mail/fax
and I'll write more about them in my next newsletter.
* * * *
My next e-mail/fax will be whenever events warrant.

Big 12 Roundup

Top five powers Oklahoma and Texas square off in Dallas Saturday in the Big
12 Conference headliner this week, but two other big games also are on tap.
Kansas State, a one-point loser to Oklahoma last week, hosts dangerous
Colorado, and Iowa State travels to Nebraska in a battle of unbeaten teams.
The Texas-Oklahoma scrap will go a long way toward deciding the Southern
Division winner.
In the Northern Division, perennial power Kansas State must defeat Colorado
to keep its title hopes alive.

Buckman Down to Horns, Heels
Brad Buckman, the 6-8 Austin Westlake forward who is ranked among the
nation's top 50 basketball recruits, took his official visit to UT last
weekend.
He visited North Carolina and Kansas earlier, and his mother told me those
are the only three schools he has been considering.
She also said he has eliminated Kansas and probably will choose between Texas
and North Carolina in the next couple of weeks.

Junior Basketball Classes Loaded

While there are several top senior stars in the boys' and girls' ranks this
year, there are four junior girls and two junior boys who are ranked among
the nation's top players already.
In fact, Beaumont Ozen's 6-11 Kendrick Perkins was picked as the No. 3
recruit in the country, regardless of class, on one national list, and some
people think 6-10 Ndudi Ebi of Houston Westbury Christian, is just as good.
The Longhorns are recruiting both of them, along with about everybody else in
the country.
The nation's top junior girl is 6-3 center Tiffany Jackson of Dallas Lincoln.
Kalee Carey, a 6-5 center at Class 4A power Canyon; Destiny Drew, a 6-2
center-forward at Corsby, and Emily Niemann, a 6-1 forward at Houston
Westbury Christian, also are drawing a lot of national attention.
Carey's father is a graduate of the UT Law School and Niemann's parents are
both Texas grads.
All four girls are considering Texas, but they also are being recruited by
many other top schools.

THE BURNT ORANGE COFFIN - Los Muertos No Hablan
by Bill Holchak - BJ '49
UT alumni are stunned to learn that the greatest  football recruit in Texas
history and his father have been murdered on their remote hill country ranch.
 But the Longhorns triumph in the end when a UT-educated detective tracks
down the killers - a group of international terrorists - and sends them to
their graves.

Star Nazareth Guard Picks UT

All-State guard Stephanie Thiel of Class A State Champion Nazareth, has
committed to the Texas women's basketball team.
Thiel, a 5-9 sharpshooter who averaged 21.1 points, 4.3 steals and 4.3
assists for the Swifts last season, was the Class A State Tournament MVP.
I saw her play in the state meet and she is an outstanding shooter and ball
handler.
Nazareth went 33-4 last year and its only losses were to larger schools.
She also played on the 2000 Nazareth team that also won a state title.
When I asked her why she chose the Longhorns and what other schools she
considered, she said, "I really had my heart set on going to Texas and didn't
really consider anyone else."
She is the third outstanding high school girl to commit to sign with Texas in
the early signing period next month.
Point guard Nina Norman, 5-7, of Jersey Village, committed several months
ago, and combo guard Tamra Cobbins, 5-5, of Kansas City, committed last week.
Sabrina Keys, a 6-2 center from Berkeley, Cal., had told me last week she
would visit Texas during the weekend, but she reaffirmed an earlier
commitment to Purdue and canceled the trip to Texas
LaToya Davis, a 6-2 center-forward from South Houston, is still considering
Texas, along with Texas Tech.

UT-OU Set for 11 A.M. ABC Kickoff; Brown Laments Injured Tackles

The Texas-Oklahoma game in Dallas has been selected for an ABC telecast and
will begin at 11 a.m. on October 7. I told you several weeks ago I thought
that would happen, and now it is official. It won't go to the entire
nation,
but it will go to more than just a normal regional. It is what they call a
"split national game," which means that game and another game will divide
the
nation's viewing, presumably on close to a 50-50 basis.
If you can't make the game and want to watch it on TV, I would suggest you
call your cable company to see if they are carrying the UT-OU game. If you
are in the lower half of the country, the chances are pretty good that it
will be on in your area.
* * * *
Coach Mack Brown said at his Monday news conference freshman WR Roy
Williams
"should be ready to play this week and all the others are questionable."
Williams suffered a bruised arm early in the game, and Brown said he is
feeling good enough to practice when the team resumes drills on Tuesday.
But he said DT Shawn Rogers, who suffered a sprained ankle, is among those
who are questionable, along with two other DTs, Stevie Lee (foot) and Ryan
Haywood (shoulder). "We are really thin at defensive tackle," he said.
With 230-pound Reggie White of Oklahoma State averaging 5.4 yards per carry
and 127.3 yards per game (No. 2 in the Big 12, No. 11 in the nation),
primarily running between the tackles, Brown said the list of limping
tackles
is a major concern.
He said when Rogers teams with All-American Casey Hampton at the tackles,
the
Longhorns are very hard to run against. "They are the best, as a pair, that
I've been around," he said. "They are the best we've coached or played
against."
Redshirt freshman Marcus Tubbs played well in Rogers' place, Brown said,
"but
we need to get Shawn back." He also said Rogers is good enough that he
could
miss most of the practices this week and still be able to play at a high
level if his ankle permits it.
Brown said Hampton and Tubbs are the starters, with little used substitute
Miguel McKay the only healthy DT in reserve. He said he is hoping Lee's
foot
improves enough to allow him to play, but said the coaches are "going to
talk
to some of the kids" to see who might want to help out at tackle. He said
sophomore Cole Pittman, a former DT, and true freshman Kalen Thornton are
both 270-pound DEs who could pinch hit at tackle.
"Reggie White will be a big test for us, especially if Shawn can't play,"
he
said.

RECRUITING NOTES: Two national blue-chippers took their official visits to
Texas last weekend. FB James Buchanan of Sarasota, Fla., Cardinal Mooney,
got
home late Sunday night and DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia HS in Placentia,
Cal.,
got home Monday morning. Buchanan said he met with coach Brown for about an
hour and he said Brown told him he needs to know as soon as possible what
his
plans are "so I could let them know if they needed to look somewhere else
for
a fullback." He said he really enjoyed his visit, and said he was
pleasantly
surprised to find that the UT business school is ranked No. 5 in the
country.
"I had a really good time," he said. "The players and coaches were really
down to earth, but I want to visit Florida (on Oct. 6) and I want to get
back
to Florida State again before I decide anything." He said Texas "is right
up
there. I really like the Longhorns." Jakes, who lived in Plano when he was
in
junior high, said he had "forgotten how friendly people are in Texas and
how
much they like their football." He said he had a great time, but also wants
to take another visit or two before deciding anything. The Longhorns have
16
commitments and probably will sign 22 to 25 players.
* * * *
BASEBALL RECRUITING: The Longhorn baseball team  got a commitment Monday
from
Donald Lavinski, 6-4, 205, a hard-throwing righthanded pitcher from Class
2A
state champ Weimar. He was 14-1 last season and averaged almost two
strikeouts per inning. He has good control and walked only 25 batters in 95
innings. He has been clocked as high as 93 miles per hour. He had an 0.70
ERA. He visited Texas last weekend.

Part 2

Ford Looks Good in First Outing

Heralded freshman point guard T. J. Ford looked as good as advertised
Wednesday night in the Longhorn basketball team's annual intrasquad scrimmage.
Senior guard Fredie Williams, sophomore guard Royal Ivey and sophomore
swingman Brandon Mouton had 19 points each to lead the scoring, but Ford had
16 points and nailed a three-pointer with five seconds left to knot the score
at 75-75. Coach Rick Barnes called it a draw at that point.
The Longhorns, who tied for last in the Big 12 Conference in field goal
percentage during the 2000-01 season (.412), shot well.  Both teams connected
on better than 50 percent of their field goal attempts and three-point field
goal attempts during the scrimmage.
"Coming into the season, we knew we had to get better with our field goal
percentage," Barnes said.  "I look at the stat sheet and I know we can shoot
even better than we did tonight.  I think we are a better driving team this
year, and that penetration will help our shooting.  I was pleased with
tonight, and I really like the chemistry on this team."
The Orange team was led by Mouton and Ford, plus senior forward Chris Owens,
who scored 17 points. Ford's 16 points included four of six treys, plus eight
assists and just three turnovers.
Williams and Ivey led the White squad.  Sophomore center James Thomas had 15
points and a game-high 10 rebounds, while sophomore forward Brian Boddicker
scored 15 points (4-of-6 threes) and had seven boards.
A trio of Longhorns did not suit up for the scrimmage due to injuries,
including junior guard Terrell Ross (foot, ankle), freshman swingman Sydmill
Harris (achilles) and freshman forward/center Chris Wright (knee). Wright is
expected to redshirt this season to rehabilitate his knee. The other two
should return this season.
Texas is slated to play two home exhibition games at the Erwin Center
(Wednesday, Nov. 7 vs. Alaska Anchorage, 7 p.m.; and Tuesday, Nov. 13 vs. EA
Sports All-Stars, 7 p.m.).

Newcomers Star for Women

Freshman center-forward Mercedes Williams and sophomore guard Kaira White
scored 12 points each to lead the White to a 61-36 win over the Orange in the
annual Texas women's basketball scrimmage Tuesday.
Senior guard Asha Hill had 11 points, including a game-high three
three-pointers, and senior forward Dana Godfrey  finished with 10 points.
Sophomore center Stacy Stephens had nine rebounds to lead both teams in that
department and she also scored seven points for the White.
Senior forward Tracy Cook led the Orange team with 10 points and freshman
forward Jody Bell added seven points and six rebounds.
The White squad held a 37-30 edge in rebounding and shot 45% from the floor,
hitting 22 of 49 shots, while the Orange squad hit at a 33.3 percent clip
(16-for-48).
"It was a little shaky out there at first, but that's to be expected," coach
Jody Conradt said. "You could easily tell who the returnees were by their
solid presence on the court, whereas the freshmen looked a little tentative
and uptight."
"We are looking for our identity right now. We do want to run with the ball,
but we've got to work on pushing the ball up the court quicker, getting the
outlet passes released quicker and taking the ball out of bounds as fast as
possible."

Game Quotes . .

"We played a very talented team that is well coached and is on a roll in the
BCS mix. It hurts when you throw an interception, have a punt return, a kick
return and a bad snap that all lead to eventual touchdowns and realize your
spotting Texas 28 points.
- Baylor head coach Kevin Steele
* * * *
"Early in the ball game, the defense did what it was supposed to do. It
stopped Baylor when it had to. Then the offense did what it was supposed to
do. It started scoring touchdowns. It got a little sloppy after that, but
overall, I thought we did a good job."
- Texas defensive coordinator Carl Reese
* * * *
"In most cases today, the run was outnumbered. We knew it would be hard, but
Cedric (Benson) did a good job for us, and we were able to get good matchups
in the passing game because they had to play Roy (Williams) and B. J.
(Johnson) and Sloan (Thomas) one on one. We ran two backs more than we have
in other games to try to get more blocking."
- UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis
* * * *
"I might have gained 108 yards today, but it didn't come easy. The offensive
line did a great job today. Baylor played tough all day long. I feel like the
offense is starting to get into a rhythm. Hopefully we can keep stepping it
up more each week. I'm happy with the win. Every team in the Big 12 has
talent and winning on the road isn't easy."
 - Longhorn freshman RB Cedric Benson
* * * *
"It's really competitive out there and we did a lot of things right, but we
made too many mistakes to beat a team as good as Texas."
- Baylor wide receiver Reggie Newhouse
* * * *
"I thought we were going to make more big plays, and I got a little impatient
at times. Overall, I thought the offense played well and moved the ball and
scored some points."
- UT quarterback Chris Simms
* * * *
"My eyes lit up when I saw that man-for-man coverage. We've got the mentality
that nobody can cover us man for man. I respect them for trying it. We
haven't seen a lot of manh coverage this year."
- Longhorn wide receiver Roy Williams, who had six catches for 147 yards and
a touchdown
* * * *
"It was just like being at home. I wanted everyone to know I can compete with
the older guys, and that's hard to do when you're a freshman."
- Texas freshman linebacker Derrick Johnson, talking about coming back to
Waco, where he starred for the Waco Lions, for the first time as a college
player

Scouting Kansas

Texas will host Kansas at 11:30 a.m. Saturday in the Longhorns' final home
game of the season. It will not be televised.
Texas is 8-1 overall and 5-1 in the Big 12. Kansas is 2-6 overall and 1-5 in
the Big 12. As if the Jayhawks didn't have enough problems, head coach Terry
Allen got the axe Sunday and one of his assistants was named interim coach.
Kansas opened the season with a 24-10 win over Southwest Missouri, then fell
to UCLA, 41-17. The Jayhawks lost at Colorado, 27-16, before upsetting Texas
Tech in Lubbock, 34-31.
Then they lost to Oklahoma, 38-10, fell to Missouri in three overtimes,
38-34, lost to Kansas State, 40-6, and fell to Nebraska, 44-7.
A pair of Texans lead the Jayhawk offense. RB Reggie Duncan of Killeen is
their top rusher, averaging 73.5 yards per game, and QB Mario Kinsey of Waco
is averaging 106.2 yards per game in total offense.
Kinsey is a scrambler who has 190 net rushing yards this season, despite a
lot of sacks.
This Kansas team has had its moments, headed by the upset of Texas Tech in
Lubbock, but it has too little offense (109th in the country) and too little
defense (90th in the nation) to compete with Texas unless the Longhorns mess
up royally.
Look for freshman RB Cedric Benson to have a good day against a run defense
that gives up 236.3 yards a game and for QB Chris Simms and his receivers to
light up the scoreboard, too.

Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):
Texas                    Kansas
Offense
(51)     164.7       Rushing Avg.         (91)   118.3
(39)     240.6       Passing Avg.         (96)   161.6
(40)     405.3      Total Off. Avg.     (109)  279.9
(5)        39.2      Scoring Avg         (100)    18.5
Defense
(10)       86.2      Rushing Avg.       (111)   236.3
(8)       165.8      Passing Avg.         (27)   186
(3)       252       Total Def. Avg.       (90)   422.3
(5)        13.1  Opp. Scoring Avg       (102)     34.5
Longhorn Notes . .
* Texas improved to 31-0 when outrushing its opponent in the Mack Brown era.
Conversely, the Longhorns are 4-12 when outrushed by their opponents under
Brown.
* Freshman RB Cedric Benson had 108 rushing yards, giving him 682this season
and moving him  into fifth on the UT freshman list. He is the eighth player
in UT history - and the first freshman - to rush for 100 yards in four
straight games. Benson also tied Earl Campbell's freshman record for 100-yard
games in a season (4). He ran for two scores, giving him seven rushing TDs
this season. That places him fourth on the UT freshman list, one shy of the
record of eight shared by Ricky Williams, Butch Hadnot and Graylon Wyatt.

Note to E-Mail Subscribers:

I published a roster in the mail version of my newsletter. If you have the UT
media guide (the big, back-breaking thing) or if you went to the first game
and got a program, you already have it. I have a lot of out-of-state
subscribers and I always try to publish the roster so they can tell who is
who when they watch it on television.

But I had to use a copy. It isn't in my computer, so I can't e-mail it to
you. If you don't have the media guide and didn't come to the first game,
then you probably will want it.

I can fax it to you if send me a fax no. or I can mail you a copy if you will
send me a self-addressed envelope.

Football Notes . .
Dan Smith, the junior college transfer who handled the kickoff duties against
New Mexico State, is from Charles City, Iowa, and Waldforf JC in Iowa. He was
booting them out of the end zone in pre-game drills, but tailed off slightly
in the game. The coaches like his leg strength and the height he gets on his
kicks. He wears No. 33.
* * * *
The guy who used to wear No. 33 is junior RB Kenny Hayter. He has transferred
to TCU and will have two season to play after sitting out this year to
establish his eligibility.
* * * *
Freshman walk-on kicker Dusty Mangum of Mesquite was named the Big 12
Conference Special Teams Player of the Week after setting a UT freshman debut
scoring record for a kicker with 11 points. He was 2-for-2 on field goals and
5-for-5 on extra points. His two field goals also tied Jeff Ward's 1983
freshman debut record in that category.
* * * *
True freshmen who played Saturday, in addition to Mangum, were RB Cedric
Benson, LBs Derrick Johnson and Aurmon Satchell and WR Brian Carter. Satchell
enrolled in January after signing last year. Coach Mack Brown said unless a
rash of injuries changes his plans, all of the other freshmen except possibly
one defensive back will redshirt.
* * * *
The Longhorns have won nine straight games in Royal Memorial Stadium. That is
their longest home winning streak since 1984.
* * * *
The coaches named OLs Mike Williams and Antwan Kirk-Hughes the outstanding
offensive players, LB Everick Rawls, CB Rod Babers and DE Kalen Thornton the
outstanding defensive performers and safety Phillip Geiggar the top special
team player in the season opener.

Tyrone Richardson Only Horn Missing After Reporting Date

The Texas veterans, 58 scholarship players strong, checked in on time
Wednesday, with freshman RB Tyrone Richardson the only absentee.
Richardson,
who enrolled in January and went through spring practice, said, "I have
some
academic issues I need to take care of to return to the team." He said he
hopes to be back in January.
Coach Mack Brown said he is excited about the heralded freshman class and
about the returning players. "I am really looking forward to meshing the
two
groups together," he said. "This is a very exciting time for everyone
involved with Texas football."
Brown said the Longhorns don't deserve their No. 7 national ranking heading
into the season, but he said the team has a chance to improve enough to
deserve the high ranking later this year.
He has cited the loss of all the starters at wide receiver and defensive
end
as two of the main reasons he thinks the team doesn't deserve a top-10
ranking right now. That talented freshmen class includes the best three
wide
receivers I've seen in Texas (Roy Willliams, B. J. Johnson and Sloan
Thomas)
in the 10 years I've been doing this, plus another outstanding prospect who
is a former quarterback (Tony Jeffery). It also includes Adam Doiron and
Kalen Thornton, two big, quick defensive ends who have a lot of potential.
Brown said it is rare for true freshmen to be play a major role on a good
team before mid-season, but some of the veteran defensive backs who came
out
to watch the freshman receivers Tuesday afternoon said they don't think it
will take Williams, Johnson, Thomas and Jeffery that long.
Starting free safety Greg Brown said, "They are really good players. They
are
big and they have great speed. I think they have a chance to help us a
lot."
Starting cornerback Rod Babers, never one to shy away from a challenge,
said
he plans to welcome the rookies by showing them a big-time hit at the line
of
scrimmage, but he, too, said he was impressed. "They are really fast and
they
all catch the ball pretty good," he said. "They have good height, too."
Until the youngsters start knocking heads with the varsity, nothing is
certain, but the early betting would be on at least two of the young wide
receivers to play major roles on the 2000 Longhorn team.
* * * *
Some of you have asked me to break down the current list of commitments and
the prospects for adding more commitments on a position-by-position basis.
It's a little to early to do any guessing about future commitments at wide
receiver and defensive back because the coaches probably will wait to see a
few high school games before deciding which WRs and DBs to go after. But
here's the way it looks to me at the other spots (national top 100 players
are underlined):
QB - (no commitment) Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch and Bret Rawls of
Shreveport Evangel, the highest rated QBs in their respective states, are
the
two main prospects. UT should get one of them.
RB - (no commitment) Cedric Benson of Midland Lee and Anthony Johnson of
Jefferson are the two most likely future Longhorns, but Jabari Davis of
Tucker, Ga., and Eric Shelton of Lexington, Ky., are two superstars who say
they plan to visit UT. James Buchanon of Sarasota, Fla., is the only
fullback
UT is recruiting.
TE - (no commitment)  James Moses of Galena Park North Shore is the only
tight end on the UT horizon.
OL - (7 commitments) Texas has commitments from Jonathan Scott of Dallas
Carter, Abe Robinson of Jersey Village, Matt Garcia of Galena Park, Will
Allen of Cypress Falls, Roman Reeves of Livingston, Terrance Young of
Longview and Alfio Randall of Blinn JC. The Longhorns will sign one or two
more, if they can get Jamie Hightower of Jacksonville, William Winston of
Houston Madison or Ben Wilkerson of Hemphill.
DE - (no commitments) The coaches want to sign about five defensive linemen
and at least three of them probably will be ends. The ones UT has the best
shots at are Eric Hall of Clarksville, Tenn., Kaelen Jakes of Valencia,
Cal.,
and Kevin Everett of Port Arthur Jefferson. Shaun Cody of Los Altos HS in
Hacienda Heights, Cal., who had an incredible 33 sacks last year, also says
he will visit Texas.
DT - (no commitments) Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison and Paul Broussard
of
Blinn JC are the main hopes.
LB - (1 commitment) Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison is the only middle
backer
UT will take. Derrick Johnson of Waco, Jonathan Jackson of Galena Park
North
Shore and Lance McFarland of Jefferson are other possibilities. Jackson and
McFarland also have big frames and could wind up at defensive end.

August
18.

Horns Have Final Public Scrimmage Before Huge Crowd
Coach Mack Brown put the Longhorns through a short, but spirited scrimmage
Wednesday night in Royal Memorial Stadium before an enthusiastic crowd UT
officials estimated at about 7,500.
With the first-team defense sitting out most of the scrimmage, the offenses
dominated most of the way. Chris Simms hit 5 of 8 passes for 144 yards,
including a 5-yard touchdown pass to freshman sensation Roy Williams, who
had
set up the score with a great catch of a  50-yard Simms' throw, and a
67-yard
TD pass to WR Montrell Flowers off a fake reverse.
The first-team offense also scored on a two-yard run by TB Victor Ike,
after
starting TB Hodges Mitchell set it up with a 50-yard gallop.
But QB Major Applewhite led the second-team offense to two touchdowns,
hitting 10 of 13 for 173 yards, including scoring tosses of 70 yards to the
other sensational freshman WR, B. J. Johnson, and 15 yards to senior
Brandon
Healy. Applewhite's TD pass to Johnson was a short screen up the middle and
Johnson just ran away from all the pursuit. Starting safety Greg Brown
intercepted one of Applewhite's throws on the second-team's first
possession.
Brown still wouldn't give any hint about who will be his starting QB in the
season opener next week, but did say both QBs played well. Brown also said,
"I was really pleased with the wide receivers. I thought they made some
steps
in running better routes and making the tough catches."
He also said Ike is clearly the No. 2 TB behind Mitchell at this point.
Redshirt freshman Ivan Williams had a great spring, but has not been
dominating during the current practices. He also has had some nagging
injuries. Brown said Ike, the fastest of the tailbacks, has been doing well
in practice. "Victor has been doing the best since he's been here," Brown
said. "He is doing much better without the ball (blocking) than he has in
the
past."
* * * *
Defensive coordinator Carl Reese, who has nine starters back, says he is
feeling better about his new defensive ends. "I've got four guys I think
can
play," Reese said. "Cory Redding and Jermain Anderson are the starters, and
Kaelen Thornton has really been doing a good job. He just keeps getting
better, so he'll be the first backup for Anderson, and Cole Pittman has had
three solid scrimmages in a row, so  he'll be the guy behind Redding. I
think
all four of them will play a lot, and they're the four main ones right
now."
Thornton, a true freshman, is one of the larger DEs at about 6-3, 270, but
Reese  said he is "pretty quick out there. He gets a good rush from the
edge,
and that's what we like. He also is learning to do a better job against the
run."
He said Pittman, who was moved over from tackle to provide better run
support, "has been doing a good job against the run, and he's a pretty good
pass rusher, too. I think we'll be okay with those four guys as soon as
they
get a little more experience."
* * * *
Brown said the team will have one more open practice and it will be
Thursday
at 3:30 at Denius Field. Then he plans to give the team three days off to
try
to let the players recover from the grueling two-a-day workouts. The team
will go back to work Monday to get ready for the Saturday opener at 11:30
a.m. against Louisiana-Lafayette.
* * * *
INJURY UPDATE: Brown said OT Mike Williams suffered a twisted leg in the
scrimmage, but he said he didn't think it was serious.
* * * *
RECRUITING  NOTES: The Longhorns still have 13 commitments. DE Eric Hall,
6-3, 225, 4.5, of Clarksville, Tenn., who will take his official visit to
Texas the Sept, 9 weekend, rushed 10 times for 102 yards and completed 5 of
7
passes for 106 yards and two TDs to lead his team to a 34-0 victory over
Springfield  Friday in the season opener for both teams. He plays QB and
safety, but said he didn't play any defense after the first half. . . DT
Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison, says Texas is still his top team, and he
said he will come to the Louisiana-Lafayette game Dec. 9. "I really like
what
Mack Brown has been doing since he came to Texas," Harris said.

Recruiting Roundup
Tyler DB Matt Melton, 5-11, 190, 4.43, committed to Texas last week  "because
I knew I wanted to stay in state and, after visiting A&M and Texas
(unofficially), I just like Texas better."
He said he visited UT unofficially because he wants to take his official
visit the December 14 weekend to attend the Longhorn football banquet.
Melton, who has 40 tackles and two interceptions so far this year, said he
had offers "from about 15 or 16 schools, including Texas, A&M, Purdue, TCU,
Baylor and West Virginia."
He is the 16th recruit to commit to Texas. He is a member of my Fabulous 50.
The other recruits who have committed to Texas include nine recruits who are
listed on one or more national top 100 teams.
They are WR Marquis Johnson, 6-3, 200, 4.48, of Centennial High School in
Champaign, Illinois;  DE Chase Pittman, 6-5, 263, 4.7, of Shreveport Evangel;
LB Garnet Smith, 6-3, 221, 4.54, of Arlington Lamar, DTs Sonny Davis, 6-1,
320, 5.0, of Gulf Coast JC in Mississippi and formerly of Austin Lanier, Earl
Anderson, 6-4, 270, 4.8, of San Marcos, Lyle Sendlein, 6-4,  260, 4.8, of
Scottsdale Chaparral, the two-time defending Class 4A champion in Arizona;
OLs  Brett Valdez, 6-4, 310, 5.1, of  Brownwood and Neale Tweedie, 6-5, 260,
4.9, of Allen;  and TE David Thomas, 6-3, 210, 4.6, of Wolfforth Frenship.
Davis made all of the top national lists last year.
The other Longhorn pledges are DT Tully Janszen, 6-4, 255, 4.78, of Keller;
LBs Brian Robison, 6-3, 245, 4.6, of Splendora and Marcus Myers, 6-3, 220,
4.5, of Pflugerville Connally;   WR Dustin Miksch, 6-0, 165, 4.4, of Round
Rock Westwood;  QB Billy Don Malone, 6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7, of  Paris North
Lamar, and  RB/Ath Clint Haney, 5-11, 190, 4.27 of Smithson Valley.
* * * *
Michael Williams, the big and fast linebacker from Lindale I wrote about it
my last issue, went to the Oklahoma-Baylor game Saturday and committed to the
Sooners.
When I talked to him Sunday night, he called it "a soft commitment," and
said, "I'm still going to visit Texas on December 14 and I might visit
Minnesota and Texas Tech, too."
I think he's in about the same boat as Garnet Smith, the Arlington Lamar
linebacker who is committed to Texas.
Both say they are committed, but both want to look around a little bit to see
if they find anything better.
I always compare it to being engaged and dating other people, which makes
getting married somewhat iffy.
Williams probably will wind up at OU and Smith probably will wind up at
Texas, but both cases will bear watching right up to and through signing day
in February.

Several top national recruits were in Austin for the Texas-Colorado game,
including DE Bryan Pickryl of Jenks, Oklahoma, who was there on his official
visit.
He wasn't expected back at home until Monday, so I wasn't able to talk to him
after his visit, but before his visit he told me he has narrowed his choices
to Oklahoma, Texas and Missouri.
Top Texas players who were at the game included RB Albert Hardy of Galena
Park, MLB Aaron Harris of North Mesquite, DE Travis Leitko of The Woodlands
and WR Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus.
Players already committed to UT who were there included Smith, Anderson,
Thomas, Janszen, Myers and Miksch.
This Longhorn recruiting class is already ranked No. 5 in the country by a
couple of national recruiting services.
The ranking will improve dramatically if the Horns hold what they have and
add a few top national recruits like DT Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings, QB
Vincent Young of Houston Madison, DE Larry Dibbles of Lancaster, and some of
the players who attended the game Saturday, like Pickryl, Hardy, Harris,
Leitko and Timmons.
The Horns won't get all of those guys, but they
(continued on page 6)

Recruiting . . (continued from page 3)
will get several of them and their chances are very good with Wright,
Dibbles, Harris, Hardy and Timmons, if he walks the straight and narrow path
for the rest of the season.
They also are close to 50-50 with Pickryl, Young, and Leitko.
If Williams does follow through on his plans to visit Texas the Dec. 14
weekend, his pledge to OU might turn out to be really soft.
Of course, the same could be said of Smith's commitment to Texas, if he
follows through on his announced plans to take other visits.
* * * *
Texas has pledges from five players on my 25-man "difference maker" list,
including No. 4 DT Anderson, No. 11 LB Smith, No. 17 LB Brian Robison of
Splendora, No. 23 OL Brett Valdez of Brownwood and No. 24 QB Billy Don Malone
of Paris North Lamar.
The Horns have a pretty good shot at everyone in the top seven on that list -
No. 1 DT  Wright, No. 2 QB Young, No. 3 DE Dibbles, No. 5 DE Leitko, No. 6 RB
Hardy and No. 7 LB Harris .
They won't get all of that group, but they might get most of them.
* * * *
I think the Longhorns will sign at least four  players from the eight-member
group of superstars that includes Wright, Dibbles, Harris, Hardy, Pickryl,
Young, Lietko and Timmons.
If they do, this class will rank very high nationally, probably in the top 3.
That would give the Longhorns four straight super classes heading into next
season and, for the first time, the oldest group of that foursome would be
seniors or juniors who have redshirted.
* * * *
The Longhorns, with 16 commitments already, have a couple of shaky ones in
Smith, who plans to take other visits, and one player who has an uphill
battle to qualify.
They can take more than the normal 25 limit in a single year because Pittman
plans to graduate from Shreveport Evangel in December and enroll at Texas in
January, which will let him count against last year's total.
Pickryl also plans to graduate early, so he also could be counted back to
last year if he signs with Texas.
I expect the Longhorns to take commitments from another 10 to 12 recruits.
The number will be on the low side if Smith stays solid and Pickryl goes
alsewhere, but it will rise if Smith strays and Pickryl comes aboard.
* * * *
Sonny Davis suffered a torn ACL in a recent game at Gulf Coast JC in
Mississippi and is due to undergo knee surgery this week.
His mother told me he still hopes to graduate early and enroll at Texas in
January. The surgery probably would knock him out of most or all of the
contact work, but should allow him to be fully recovered by the start of next
season.

Game Quotes . .
"We played poorly. We turned the ball over and could not overcome the
adversity we created for ourselves. I give Texas a lot of credit. They have
good players who are well coached. I feel bad that we didn't give them a
better game."
- Colorado head coach Gary Barnett
* * * *
"We did not want to be one dimensional. We knew it wouldn't be easy to run on
Colorado, but we knew we had to keep at it. I thought the offensive line did
a good job and Cedric (Benson) did a great job."
- Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis
* * * *
"We worked all week against two tight ends and I think in this game they ran
two tight ends maybe four times. They did a great job of coming and doing
exactly what we weren't planning on. But our guys did a pretty good job of
improvising."
- UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese
* * * *
"We forced some turnovers today, and when you got most of the turnovers, you
usually win the game."
- UT linebacker De'Andre Lewis
* * * *
"Sloan Thomas is probably the most underrated wide receiver in the country."
- Longhorn QB Chris Simms, talking about the backup wide receiver who has
scored two touchdowns in each of the last two games
* * * *
"We did self destruct a little bit, but I don't want to take anything away
from Texas. They came out ready to play on both sides of the ball, as well as
on special teams. We made a lot of mistakes today and they had us on our
heels throughout the second half."
- Colorado linebacker Joey Johnson
* * * *
"He's an unbelievable running back. He runs hard and that move he put on to
break that long gain on the shovel pass at the end of the first half was
unbelievable."
- Simms, talking about Longhorn freshman running back Cedric Benson
* * * *
"They beat us in every phase of the game. I don't think it was one particular
thing. We had some turnovers and they put together some long drives. They
also did a nice job in the punt return game."
- Buff linebacker Robbie Robinson
* * * *
"We can't keep our defense on the field that long. We let the defense down.
We self-destructed and Texas took advantage of everything."
- Colorado running back Cortlen Johnson
* * * *
"We not only won, but we dominated, and Colorado is a good football team."
- UT head coach Mack Brown

First BCS Standings Due Today

The first Bowl Championship Series standings are going to be released today
(Monday) and the Longhorns should rank just about seventh, which,
coincidentally, is where they are in both major polls this week.
What that mean is that Texas has a very good chance to land one of the four
major BCS bowl spots if they take care of business and win their final four
games to finish the regular season at 10-1.
Upsets have thinned the ranks of unbeaten teams in the last two weeks,
leaving only eight teams in major college football with perfect records.
They are No. 1 Miami, No. 2 Oklahoma, No. 3 Nebraska, No. 4 UCLA, No. 5
Virginia Tech, No. 10 Maryland, No. 14 Washington State and No. 16 Brigham
Young.
At least two of those teams will lose in the near future because Oklahoma and
Nebraska clash this week and Washington State and UCLA meet in early November.
The top two teams in the final BCS standings will play for the national title
in the Rose Bowl on January 3.
Texas coach Mack Brown and his Longhorns hope to be in that game, but their
chances are somewhere between very slim and none because Oklahoma would have
to lose twice in the regular season for that to happen and then the Horns
would have to beat the Big 12 North winner, probably Nebraska.
But, by winning out and finishing 10-1, the Longhorns would have a great
chance to play in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans in the post-season.

 Horns Rip Bears; Passing Game Clicks, Benson Has 108 Yards, 2 TDs on Stacked
Defense

QB Chris Simms and his receivers had a great day against Baylor's man-for-man
coverage Saturday and freshman RB Cedric Benson ran for 108 yards and two
touchdowns. in a 49-10 rout.
The Bears were determined to deny the Longhorns a running game and they
stacked the line and dared Simms to pass.
He did, hitting 15 of 29 passes for 271 yards and two touchdowns, but the
Bears' strategy backfired against the run, too, because of Benson's fierce
running and the line's strong blocking.
With starting guard Antwan-Kirk Hughes out with a sprained ankle, the Horns
were already running low on guards when Tillman Holloway went down with a
neck and shoulder injury.
But Beau Baker, who has worked at both guard and center, came in and played
so well the Longhorns didn't miss a beat.
The victory ran UT's record to 8-1 overall and 5-1 in the Big 12, while
Baylor fell to 2-6 and 0-6.
Longhorn coach Mack Brown saluted the Bears for their effort. "They really
played hard and they  played well," he said. "We just had better players."
"Baylor's defenses is one of the better defenses in the league," he said.
The Longhorns' kick returnees had a field day. Nathan Vasher had 173 yards on
seven punt returns, including a 60-yarder that set up the second touchdown,
another for 44 yards deep into Bear territory and another for 24 yards that
set up another touchdown.
He also had a pass interception deep in Baylor territory that set up a short
TD drive.
Victor Ike only got to return one kickoff, but he did it in fine style,
bolting 60 yards to the Baylor 37 to give the Horns a short field for their
fifth touchdown drive.
Sophomore WR Roy Williams had his best day of the season with six receptions
for 147 yards, including a 36-yarder for the first score.
Here, briefly, is how the game went
First Quarter
Texas won the toss and deferred. Baylor's Bobby Hart gave the Bears an early
chance, bobbling a UT punt, then picking it up and returning it 42 yards to
the Texas 43. The Longhorn defense held. Then Simms hit WR Sloan Thomas, but
Thomas bobbled it right into the hands of Bear DB Derrick Cash. That set
Baylor up at the Texas 38. The UT defense held again, with LB Tyrone Jones
leaping high and blocking Baylor's attempted 43-yard field goal. After the
blocked FG, UT drove 69 yards in six plays to take the lead. Simms connected
with Williams for 36 yards and the TD. Benson carried twice for 10 yards and
also caught a 15-yard shovel pass. Dusty Mangum's kick gave the Horns a 7-0
lead with 4:24 left. Baylor couldn't move and punter. Vasher ran the 55-yard
punt back 60 yards to the BU 28. Simms connected with Thomas for 17 yards,
then Benson carried twice for 10 yards before Simms got the touchdown on a
1-yard sneak. Mangum's kick gave Texas a 14-0 lead with 2:16 left.
Second Quarter
The Bears sacked Simms at the UT early in the period, giving them possession
at the Longhorn 48 after Brian Bradford's strong 43-yard punt. QB Josh Zachry
hit passes for 15 and 18 yards, then scored from the 10 on a QB draw to cut
the UT lead to 14-7 with 12:29 left. Midway through the quarter, the
Longhorns drove 84 yards in four plays for their third TD. Simms connected
with Thomas for the final 31 yards, after a 46-yarder to Williams set it up.
Mangum's give put UT on top, 21-7, with 5:18 left. On Texas' next possession,
Simms hit Williams for 34 yards, but Mangum's 5-yard field goal try failed.
Vasher's interception three plays later set the Horns up at the Bear 23.
Simms connected with WR B. J. Johnson for 21 yards, then RB Brett Robin
scored the TD. Mangum's kick made it 28-7 with 52 seconds left. Zachry hit
four passes for 49 yards to get the Bears to the UT 11 and Adam Stiles kicked
a 28-yard field goal on the final play to cut the UT lead to 28-10.
Third Quarter
Ike returned the kickoff 60 yards to the Baylor 37. Benson churned for 13
over right tackle, then Simms found Williams, who made a great catch at the
4. Benson got the TD on a 3-yard run. Mangum's kick put Texas head, 35-10,
with 12:04 left. Vasher's 24-yard punt return to the Baylor 43 had the Horns
on the move again as the quarter ended.
Fourth Quarter
Benson finished the drive with a 6-yard run. Mangum's kick made it 42-10 with
13:48 left. On the Bears' next possession, QB Davon Vinson was in the shotgun
when the ball was snapped over his head. UT safety Dakarai Pearson recovered
in the end zone. Mangum's kick made it 49-10 with 12:58 left.

Texas, The BCS & The Bowls

 Coach Mack Brown talked last week to John Swafford, a top BCS official, and
Swafford said the BCS rule prohibiting three teams being selected for the
four BCS bowls from one league takes precedence over the BCS rule that the
top four teams in the final BCS poll have to be chosen.
That really simplifies things when figuring out how UT can qualify for a BCS
bowl.
First, the Longhorns have to win the rest of their games. Second, Texas has
to finish in the top four in the final BCS poll on Dec. 9. Third, the
Longhorns have to be ahead Nebraska or Oklahoma in the final BCS poll.
Brown said the Longhorns just have to keep winning and see where they wind
up.
I think there is a fair chance Oklahoma will lose to Texas Tech in Lubbock.
The Sooners were never great shakes on offense this year and their offensive
unit is pretty banged up.
If Tech does upset the Sooners, that would drop them out of the top four and
clear the way for the Longhorns as long as they keep winning.
The Sooners also might fall out of the top four if they win the rest of their
regular season games and lose to Nebraska in the Big 12 Championship Game.
One thing that would be fatal to the Longhorns chances of landing a BCS bowl
berth would be for OU to win out, then beat Nebraska in the title game. With
one loss each and those losses to each other, both teams would  stay ahead of
the Longhorns in the BCS ranking.
Texas was fifth in last week's poll while Nebraska was No. 1, Oklahoma was
No. 2. Miami was No. 3, Michigan was No. 4, Stanford was No. 6, Tennessee was
No. 7, Florida was No. 8, UCLA was No. 9,  Oregon was No. 10, Washington was
No. 11 and Washington State was No. 12.
No. 4 Michigan, No. 6 Stanford and No. 9 UCLA all lost Saturday, giving them
two losses each and effectively knocking them out of the BCS bowls.
Some of the teams below the Horns will move up because their schedules are
stronger and they might pass Texas until and unless they lose again.
Which brings us back to my original premise: if the Longhorns win out, they
are in good shape if Oklahoma loses another regular season game and maybe
even if OU loses to Nebraska again.
If the Horns win out and still finish below Nebraska and Oklahoma in the BCS
poll or if they fail to finish in the top four, look for them to wind up in
the Cotton Bowl.
But I'm optimistic. If they win out, I think they will be in the Sugar Bowl,
one of the four BCS bowls. Some of the other top teams will lose again, and
one of them might be the Sooners in Lubbock.

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings are
so confusing that he has told his team to "keep working to be the best team
it can be because good things usually happen for the best team."
"What we do every Sunday is we meet with the team," he said. " We go over the
film and talk about the good and the bad, and then I take time to go over the
BCS."
Noting that five undefeated teams lost the previous weekend and three top 10
teams - Michigan, Stanford and UCLA - lost for the second time Saturday,
Brown said teams just have to concentrate on the only thing they control -
winning.
"We want to play as good as we can play every week," he said. "That's the
only thing we can control. I've asked them to try to play to a standard, to
try to get better on every play."
He also said he has told them not to worry about the BCS because it will all
work out for them if they keep winning their games.
He also said that is one reason for the 11:30 a.m. kickoff Saturday for the
final home game against Kansas.
"They're kids and they are going to watch some scores," he said. "That's one
reason I wanted the early kickoff. There aren't many scores to watch at 11:30
a.m."
Brown said the team "played a complete game" in the win over Baylor.
He said sophomore safety Dakarai Pearson was chosen as the defensive player
of the game after scoring a touchdown with a fumble recovery and leading the
team in tackles with nine.
Sophomore WR Roy Williams was picked as the top offensive performer after
catching six passes for 147 yards and a touchdown, and another sophomore,
Nathan Vasher, was picked as the top special teams performer after returning
seven punts for 173 yards.
Brown also said QB Chris Simms has shown a lot of improvement in recent weeks
and true freshman RB Cedric Benson "continues to play well and seems to
improve every week."
INJURY NOTE: Brown said he hopes injured offensive guards Antwan Kirk-Hughes,
who has missed the last two games with a sprained ankle, and Tillman
Holloway, who suffered a shoulder and neck injury during the Baylor game,
will be able to play this week. He also said Beau Baker "played really well"
at guard after Holloway's injury.

Horns Fifth in Both Polls

Texas is fifth in both major football polls this week.
Miami is No. 1 and Nebraska is No. 2 in both polls, while Oklahoma is No. 3
and Florida No. 4 in the Associated Press poll and their positions are
reversed in the USA Today/CNN poll.

Freshmen Score 3 TDs in Saturday Scrimmage

The Longhorns scored four touchdowns in their Saturday scrimmage, and three
of them were scored by true freshmen. And, no, Roy Williams was not one of
the TD makers. Williams has been the freshman star of the early practices,
but fellow freshmen B. J. Johnson, Nathan Vasher and Sloan Thomas showed
Saturday they are ready for prime time, too.
Chris Simms connected with senior Brandon Healy for a 63-yard pass-and-run
play to open the scoring, but then the freshmen took over. Major Applewhite
found Johnson just breaking past CB Quentin Jammer for a 75-yard
pass-and-run
touchdown against the first-team defense. It was the first touchdown the
second-team has scored against the defensive starters in their two
scrimmages.
Johnson made a great catch in traffic, then turned on the speed to complete
the long scoring play.
Vasher, however, had the longest scoring jaunt of the day, bolting 79 yards
on a punt return. He made a couple of great moves to get started, then used
his speed to outrun the pursuit.
Beau Trahan, who was moved from safety to quarterback last week, threw a
beautiful pass to Thomas for a 15-yard scoring play.
Simms again took all the snaps for the first team and Applewhite, last
year's
co-Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year, again worked with the second team.
Brown said no decision has been made on which QB will be the starter in the
season opener, but he did say no significance should be given to the fact
the
Simms has worked with the first team throughout the first two scrimmages.
He
said the coaches know what Applewhite can do with the first team, and they
want to see what Simms can do with the first team.
Simms, leading the starters against the second-team defense, had only
slightly better statistics than Applewhite, who went against the defensive
starters all day. Simms completed 7 of 17 passes for 142 yards, with the
63-yard touchdown pass to Healy. He also gave up an interception by backup
linebacker O. J. McClintock. Applewhite completed 6 of 18 passes for 119
yards, including the TD pass to Johnson. He also allowed a pick by walk-on
defensive back Chad Davis.
Backup TBs Victor Ike and Ivan Williams led the rushers with 34 and 25
yards,
respectively. Ike had seven carries and Williams had five.
The first-team defense, which was No. 6 in the nation last year in yardage
allowed, has been very stingy against the run throughout the fall drills.
Healy led the receivers with four catches for 102 yards, but Johnson was
close behind with two grabs for 94 yards.
Coach Mack Brown thanked the approximately 2,000 Longhorn fans who attended
the 9:30 a.m. scrimmage, and he said the players were tired, but still gave
a
great effort.
He said Williams hurt his shoulder, but it was not serious and did not
prevent him from going back in the game. He also said Vasher showed "great
quickness" on his scoring punt return, and said he will "probably be used
on
some punt returns this year."
The first-team offense scored on its first possession against the
second-team
defense when Simms found Healy open all alone down the middle, but the
second-team defenders held the starters without another score. The
second-team defense is much more talented this year than it was last year,
and defensive coordinator Carl Reese said that will allow him to rest the
starters more and keep his players fresher.
Fan appreciation day begins at 2 p.m. Sunday at Royal Memorial Stadium.
Brown
urged all Longhorn fans to show up. Players and coaches will be available
for
autographs.

RECRUITING  NOTE: Getting a commitment from Midland Lee running back Cedric
Benson, Texas Football Magazine's first high school cover boy, is going to
help the Longhorns snare some more top players. It may not help with
running
backs, but it always helps to get a super star at a skill position. Since
Benson rushed for 3,526 yards and scored 51 touchdowns in Class 5A last
year,
he definitely qualifies as a  super star.

 Brown Says Longhorns Should Be Very Good
Offensively with Chance for Stout Defense, Too

Coach Mack Brown says the Longhorns will head into the football season with
just one problem on offense and fewer than expected on defense if his young
tackles come through.
In an interview with coach Brown last week, I asked him how the Longhorns
compare with his best teams at North Carolina.
In a nutshell, he said Texas is better offensively than those North Carolina
teams, but is not quite as imposing defensively
His last two teams at North Carolina lost only to Florida State, posting the
best two-year record ever for the Tar Heels, and finishing in the top 10
twice, something Texas hasn't accomplished once in nearly two decades.
"Our offensive line is better here," he said. "We have two quarterbacks who
can play. We had that at North Carolina, too, but our upside is better here.
Our receivers at North Carolina were very good, but the ones we have now can
be the best we've had."
He said North Carolina's fullback and tight end  from his last team there are
still playing in the NFL, but he also noted that UT TE's Bo Scaife and Brock
Edwards, who are only sophomores in eligibility, have NFL potential, too.
He said one big plus offensively at UT is the depth the incoming freshmen
will provide in the line.
"We had good offensive linemen at North Carolina, but we had trouble finding
good ones in numbers," he said.
"We didn't have good numbers here and had to force some guys to play too
early," he said, "but that got them ready to play and now we have  good
experience and good numbers and we hope we can start redshirting our freshmen
offensive linemen. We need to get to that point."
Hesaid the only problem he sees offensively this season is at tailback, and
that isn't as big a problem as it seems because all five of the returnees
competing for the job are competent players and several of them have the
ability to step it up.
And if they don't step it up, there is a young fellow coming to two-a-days in
August who has everyone excited. I've written enough about Cedric Benson that
I won't go through it all again, but he is something special.
If you doubt it, just remember this: Three state championship games in Class
5A at Midland Lee, with five touchdowns in each game. No one else has ever
come close to doing that once in Class 5A much less three times.
Defensively, Brown has high expectations and that's only natural because 10
of the starters and 5 of the backups on his 1997 North Carolina team were NFL
draft picks. Three of his defensive linemen went in the first round.
But he says the Longhorns have some talent on defense and could be very good
if his young tackles come through.
The departures of two-time All-American Casey Hampton and his equally
formidable sidekick Shaun Rogers left a giant hole in the middle of the
Longhorn defense.
They were the run-stoppers deluxe who led a unit that ranked 12th nationally
in rushing defense, yielding 94 yards a game last year.
Eight starters return from a Longhorn defense that also ranked seventh in the
nation in total defense, yielding only 278.3 yards per game.
Brown also said Rogers, who missed several games with a badly sprained ankle
was never close to 100% last year after being injured early in the season.
"Shaun was one of the best players of his size I have seen at rushing the
passer," he said. "When we lost him, it really hurt our pass rush."
I have speculated in previous issues that the Longhorns probably will have a
better pass rush from their front four this season because sophomore-to-be
Marcus Tubbs got 5.5 sacks, second on the team last year, while standing in
for Rogers, and because the defensive ends are a year older and there is more
speed at tackle than before.
Brown said the coaches are counting on a better pass rush from their linemen
"Cory Redding and Kalen Thornton have the potential to be as good as anybody
at defense end," he said. "We have high expectations for them.'
At tackle, he said Tubbs "weighs 285 and he can run. He's got a great upside.
He's a young guy who has played well already and should just get better and
better. We're excited about him."
Brown also said the move of Maurice Gordon from end to tackle "looks like a
good one. He runs a 4.6 and he looked really good this spring. We just need
him to keep on working hard and he'll be a  good one. He's already a good
pass rusher, and he's working on getting stronger to stop the run.
While Gordon is a pass-rushing whiz, the likely starter at tackle opposite
Tubbs is redshirt freshman Stevie Lee if he is able to recover fully from
foot surgery.
Lee played well last year in spots as a true freshman, but was injured early
and was able to get a medical redshirt year, which means he is a freshman
again this year.
If Lee is healthy, Brown said the key for him is off-season conditioning
work. "Stevie can play at about 300 pounds, but he doesn't need to play at
330," he said.
"In this league, everybody spreads people out, forcing the front four to make
off-schedule plays. You can't just be a run stopper anymore. You've got to be
quick enough to make adjustments.
"We're emphasizing speed and quickness," he added. "That's why we made some
moves in the spring, like moving Maurice Gordon to tackle, O. J. McClintock
to end (from linebacker) and Lee Jackson to linebacker (from safety)."
Brown also said sophomore Adam Doiron, who also played well in relief last
season as a true freshman, has a bright future at tackle.
"He needs to get get stronger," Brown said. He's real smart and real tough.
He just needs to get more experience and use the off-season program to get
stronger."
He likes his secondary, saying, "I feel like we are in real good shape with
our secondary. We have guys who have the ability to cover and the speed to
make up ground. We also are two deep in the secondary for the first time
since we've been here."
The area where he wants to see the most improvement on defense is a
linebacker, where all three starters return.
"We have asked our linebackers to step it up," he said. "They have played
really well for us, but we want them to just take an extra step to get even
better."
The Longhorns had troubles with their place kicking in the spring, and Brown
said the returnees and three walk-ons will compete for the starting job when
two-a-days begin in early August.
Summing up, he said the Longhorns' strengths are at quarterback, wide
receiver, tight end, the offensive line, the defensive ends and the secondary.
He said defensive tackle will be a strong position, too, if Lee returns
healthy and all the young players continue to improve.
When asked to comment on the most pleasant surprises from spring training,
Brown said, "Bo Scaife returning and looking like he is ready to play is one.
Kyle Shanahan (a walk-on wide receiver) did some really good things. Derrick
Dockery finally being healthy again was a big positive development."
He said all of the "spin-down" moves the coaches made on defense this spring
are "looking good at this point. We wanted to improve our speed on defense,
and these moves have helped us accomplish that."
Asked about the biggest disappointment in the spring drills, he said, "It was
nobody emerging at tailback. They all played good, but, after Ricky Williams
and Hodges Mitchell, our expectations are very high."
True Orange Observations
Look for the Longhorns to use more one-back formations this season. Why? The
back-up wide receivers and tight ends are more dangerous than the fullbacks.
WR Sloan Thomas and TE Brock Edwards would start and star for many teams, but
they are backups at Texas.
Also, look for a lot more misdirection plays and other plays designed to make
the offense less predictable than it was last season.
* * * *
With coach Mack Brown's first great class of recruits heading into their
third seasons, and two other great classes following it, this is the season
the Longhorns should be able to finish in the top 10 for the first time since
1983.
For those of you who seem to get a little impatient at times, it is worth
noting that the Longhorns have finished in the top 20 just seven times since
1983 and three of those seven times were in Brown's first three years here -
15th in 1998, 21st in 1999 and 12th in 2000.
This Longhorn team probably will start out about fifth or sixth in the
country and it should be able to stay in the top 10 unless some wheels fall
off.
The great thing about the way Brown has built this program is that he and his
assistants recruit great prospects every year, and develop them.
I think this year will start a long string of years for UT  to be contending
for high national honors.
The only way you can win the highest national honor - a national championship
- is to get to the championship game.
Since only two teams get to the championship game, some very deserving teams
are left out. Miami and Washington, for example, were certainly deserving
last year, but unbeaten Oklahoma and once-beaten Florida State got the nod.
So, having an outstanding team doesn't guarantee a berth in the national
title game.
I won't predict the Longhorns will wind up in the Rose Bowl playing for the
national title this year, but I will predict that Brown will have us playing
in a national championship game very soon.
Teams in the Big 12 and SEC have the extra burden of having to play a
post-season game for their conference titles, which means they have to play
two godzillas back to back to be No. 1.
But great teams can do it and Texas will be a great team in the very near
future. It might not be this year, but it could be if things break the
Longhorns' way.

Scouting Colorado

Colorado, playing the toughest schedule in the country, was winless in four
games before storming into College Station and ending the Aggies' 22-game
home winning streak, 26-19, last week.
And the Buffaloes get to play the host this week when Texas comes to
mile-high Boulder for a 2:30 p.m. game Saturday. It will not be televised.
"That sure got my attention," said Texas coach Mack Brown. "College Station
is a tough place for the visiting team."
Colorado coach Gary Barnett has had a tough year up to last week. The
Buffaloes opened the season with a 28-24 loss to Colorado State, then fell =
to
Southern Cal, 17-14. Next up was Washington and the Huskies prevailed, also
by a 17-14 score. Powerful Kansas State pulled away in the second half for =
a
44-21 victory.
After the K-State loss, Barnett threatened to strip the Buffalo decals off
his players' helmets if they didn't start playing better.
Barnett went with true freshman QB Craig Ochs  all the way against A&M, and
he came through big, hitting 15 of 25 passes for 239 yards and one touchdow=
n
and running 18 yards for another touchdown.
Sensational freshman RB Marcus Houston is out with an injury, but Cortlen
Johnson dented the tough Aggie defense for 99 yards and a touchdown Saturda=
y.
WRs Javon Green and Roman Hollowell are swift and productive and TE Daniel
Graham also is a threat.
Defensively, the Buffs are led by a trio of returning linebacker starters,
headed by Jashon Sykes.
The Buffs return five offensive and six defensive starters from a team that
went 7-5 last year in Barnett's first season at the helm.
For the Longhorns to win, the defense has to prove the Oklahoma game was a
one-time disaster and go back to playing smash-mouth defense. It also has t=
o
pressure Ochs into some freshman mistakes.
Offensively, the Horns have to come out with their best shots early. They
haven't scored an offensive TD all year and haven't moved the ball at all i=
n
some of their first quarters this season. Unless the offense plays better
than it has been playing, it will be tough to win this game.
Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):

Big 12 Roundup

Oklahoma travels to Manhattan Saturday to play Kansas State in a battle of
top 10 undefeated powers.
Texas also visits Colorado in a game that will have a major bearing on the
races in both divisions because both teams already have one league loss.
Oklahoma is the only team in the Southern Division without a league loss,
while Kansas State and Nebraska are the unbeaten teams in the North.

Recruiting Roundup

Texas still has 16 commitments and the Longhorns plan to sign 22 to 25
players, with several of the remaining spots going to defensive linemen.
Tommie Harris, the great DT from Killeen Ellison, is the No. 1 guy on UT's
wish list, with Kaelen Jakes of Valencia HS in Placentia, Cal., the only
other big defensive lineman who is seriously considering the Horns.
This is a bad year for the big guys in the middle, so Harris and Jakes are =
as
important as anyone remaining on the Longhorns' wish list.
Here's a list of the Horns' 16 early commitments:
Offensive Line (7)
Jonathan Scott, 6-7, 290, 4.9, Dallas Carter
Abe Robinson, 6-6, 270, 4.9, Jersey Village
Alfio Randall, 6-6, 300, 5.1, Blinn JC
Mike Garcia, 6-5, 280, 5.2, Galena Park
Will Allen, 6-5, 300, 5.2, Cypress Falls
Roman Reeves, 6-6, 295, 5.2, Livingston
Terrance Young, 6-6, 340, 5.5, Longview
Running Back (2)
Cedric Benson, 5-11, 200, 4.5, Midland Lee
Anthony Johnson, 5-11, 195, 4.4, Jefferson
Linebacker (2)
Yamil LeBron, 6-2, 240, 4.7, Killeen Ellison
Lance McFarland, 6-1, 225, 4.6, Jefferson
Defensive Back (5)
Cedric Griffin, 6-1, 180, 4.4, San Antonio Holmes

Brian Carter, 5-11, 180, 4.5, The Woodlands
As you can see, the Longhorns are almost through recruiting offensive
linemen, running backs, linebackers and defensive backs.
They want to sign one QB, one TE, one or two WRs, Waco's great LB Derrick
Johnson (who had 30 tackles in his team's loss to power Tyler John Tyler
about 10 days ago) super safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple and any other gre=
at
prospect who wants to come.
They should be able to get a QB and TE, and they might get one WR, but
probably won't be able to get two.
They lead for both Johnson and Brandon.
If things fall like they appear to be developing, there will be at least fo=
ur
spots left for defensive linemen, and possibly more, depending on whether t=
he
coaches will sign 25 players.
But right now, it doesn't look like Texas will be able to sign a lot of top
defensive linemen because the only ones who are leaning the Longhorns' way
are Jakes, DE Eric Hall of Clarksville, Tenn., DE Kevin Everett of Port
Arthur Jefferson (who might be better suited to playing TE).
Harris appears to be wide open.
If the Horns don't fill all their defensive line needs this recruiting
season, they should be able to next year because there is a much better gro=
up
of the big guys who are juniors this year.
RECRUITING NOTES: QB Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch visited the Texas
practice Thursday and spent a lot of time after practice talking to head
coach Mack Brown and offensive coordinator Greg Davis, but he said he isn't
ready to commit and wants to look around some more . . . The other QB Texas
is recruiting, Brent Rawls of Shreveport Evangel, visits Florida State this
weekend and says he might be ready to make a decision by next week. He also
has visited Texas and Purdue, and Purdue appears to have a slight lead base=
d
on his belief that he would have a chance to play quicker with the
Boilermakers. . . LB/DE Jonathan Jackson of Galena Park North Shore is bein=
g
recruited by most colleges, including UT, as a defensive end. Colleges are
wanting DEs with great speed as outside pass rusher and Jackson ran a 4.56 =
at
a summer camp. That is very fast for a 6-3, 230-pounder.

Olympic Gold

Current and former University of Texas  student-athletes and coaches

UT Women Get 2 More Stars

College basketball coaches love always try to recruit players with height,
quickness, ball-handling ability and a good shooting eye.
The trouble is that few players have all of those abilities.
But coach Jody Conradt, who already had two outstanding recruits with all
four of those traits, landed two more last week for the Texas women's
basketball team.
Kala Bowers of Woodward, Okla., and Jody Bell of Chestermere High School in
Calgary, Alberta, Canada, two 6-2 stars who are so versatile that they have
played point guard at times, are the latest additions to Conradt's recruiti=
ng
class.
Bowers is a national top 25 player who was one of just four high school
underclassmen to be invited to try out for the 2000 junior national team
She also considered Colorado, North Carolina, Stanford and Nebraska. She
averaged 15.8 points and 7.4 rebounds last season.
Her high school is 53-2 for the last two seasons, winning one Oklahoma stat=
e
title and finishing as the runner-up to the state champion the other season=
.
"Last year, our point guard got hurt, so Kala played point guard for us,"
Woodward coach Kim Kramer said. "She's so versatile she can play any
position."
Bell averaged 14.5 points and 11.4 rebounds for Chestermere High School in
Calgary. She was a member of the Canadian junior national team.
She considered only warm-weather schools and wound up  picking Texas over
Arizona State.
Chestermere coach Brian Utley said Bell "is a 6-2 player who can handle the
ball like a guard, run the floor and shoot the three. She's an inside/outsi=
de
player with skills you normally don't see in a girl her size."
"She has great all-around skills," he said. "Texas got an outstanding playe=
r.
She really enjoyed her campus visit to Texas and really liked coach Conradt=
.
She said there were too many good things about Texas for her to go anywhere
else."
Conradt also has commitments from forward Heather Schreiber, 6-2, of
Windthorst, the state's hottest prospect, and 5-11 forward CoCo Reed of
Houston Jersey Village.
Like Bowers and Bell, they  are fine ball handlers and shooters.
Schrieber and Bowers are both on at least one national top 25 list. Schrieb=
er
has led her volleyball team to three straight state championships and alrea=
dy
has been the state tourney MVP three times, with her senior season still
remaining.

Longhorns Overcome Slow Start, Blast Bears;
Last Three Games Pose Major Challenge

The Longhorns spotted Baylor an early 7-0 lead before a sellout crowd in
Austin Saturday, then stormed back for a 48-14 win to run their season reco=
rd
to 6-2 and their Big 12 mark to 4-1.
But  road trips to Texas Tech and Kansas are next on the agenda  and then a
home game against Texas A&M wraps up the regular season.
All three opponents are dangerous and the Longhorn offense and defense will
need to start their motors running a lot quicker or things could get rough
down the stretch.
But this was Baylor, a team that had been blanked for three straight games.
Even a slow start isn't fatal against the Bears.
Louisiana-Lafayette and Baylor are the two weakest teams the Horns have
faced, and UT trailed  La-La 10-0 before coasting to an easy win.
Let's hope higher quality opponents motivate the Texas players to start
competing better from the opening kickoff.
Texas' offense gave Baylor a short field with an early fumble, and it took
the Bears less than two minutes to notch their first October TD this year.
But the offense warmed up and QB Major Applewhite threw for 297 yards and t=
wo
touchdowns and even scored on a quarterback sneak.
The Bears chose to double cover sensational freshman WR Roy Williams, and h=
is
classmate and buddy, B. J. Johnson, made them pay by hauling in nine passes
for 162 yards and a TD, the best single game ever by a UT  freshman.
But it was the Longhorn defense that set the tone for this game. After that
early lapse, the Texas defense allowed Baylor's offense only one more net
yard for the remainder of this first half and forced two turnovers that led
to 10 Texas points.
Capitalizing on the short field created by the outstanding defensive effort=
,
the Longhorns kicked two early field goals, then blew the game open with a
25-point second quarter.
The Longhorn defenders forced five Baylor turnovers, including four
interceptions =01) two by CB Quentin Jammer and one each by SS Greg Brown a=
nd
backup FS Phillip Geiggar.
The defense also held Baylor to 134 net yards =01) 77 passing and 57 rushin=
g,
while the UT offense amassed 473 yards total offense =01) 383 passing and 9=
0
rushing.
The defense forced Baylor into 11 possessions of three downs or less. The
Bears only had 16 possessions.
Here, briefly, is how the game went:
FIRST QUARTER
Baylor won the toss and deferred. The Longhorns, like they have all year,
struggled out of the starting gate. They made two first downs, but then
blitzing Baylor DB Gary Baxter blindsided UT QB Major Applewhite and knocke=
d
the ball loose. The Bears recovered at the UT 35 and scored in five plays,
with QB Guy Tomcheck hitting WR Martin Dossett for the final 18 yards. That
put Baylor ahead, 7-0, with 11:37 left. Applewhite hit freshman TE Brock
Edwards for 32 yards on the Horns' next possession to set up a 44-yard fiel=
d
goal by Kris Stockton that cut the Baylor lead to 7-3 with 8:15 left.
Starting from their own 34, the Longhorns drove to the Baylor 8 later in th=
e
quarter, primarily on the strength of a 45-yard pass from Applewhite to
freshman WR B. J. Johnson, but the drive stalled and Stockton kicked a
27-yard field goal to get the Horns back within one point at 7-6, with 1:52
left. A bungled Baylor screen pass gave the Horns great field position in t=
he
final minute of the quarter when RB Darrell Bush was ambushed by DE Cory
Redding and fumbled, with LB Everick Rawls recovering for a 14-yard loss at
the Baylor 13. TB Hodges Mitchell carried three straight times for nine
yards, bringing up a fourth-and-1 at the Bear 4 as the quarter ended.
Although they trailed, the Horns had 153 net yards offensively while Baylor
had 16.
SECOND QUARTER
Stockton kicked a 22-yard field goal on the first play of the quarter to
give the Horns a lead they would never relinquish at 9-7. Baylor went
three-plays-and-out two straight times, and, after the second one, the
Longhorns finally found the end zone. Applewhite hit Johnson for 9, Brandon
Healy for 16, Mitchell for 16 more and then Montrell Flowers for the final =
5
yards and the TD. Stockton's kick gave Texas a 16-7 lead with 8:59 left.
After an exchange of punt, UT safety Greg Brown intercepted Tomcheck's pass
at the Bear 21 and returned it to the 17. Applewhite hit Johnson to the 1,
then sneaked in for the TD. Stockton's kick made it 23-7 with 5:23 left.
After another quick Baylor punt, the Longhorns struck again. Applewhite hit
freshman WR Roy Williams for 18, found Mitchell for 25 more and then hit
Johnson for 14 yards and the TD. Texas went for two points and Applewhite
connected with Mitchell to make it 31-7 with 2:55 left. At the half, Texas
had 283 yards offensively to the Bears' 36.
THIRD QUARTER
Baylor got the ball first and drove to the Texas 21, but a 15-yard penalty
and then sacks on successive plays by CB Quentin Jammer and redshirt freshm=
an
DT Marcus Tubbs pushed the Bears back to near midfield and forced a punt.
Neither team mounted another drive until late in the period when Jammer got
his second interception and ran it back to the Baylor 46. A pass interferen=
ce
penalty and an Applewhite pass to Johnson set up a 31-yard Stockton FG to
make it 34-7 with 3:15 left. The Longhorns had 340 yards at this point to
Baylor's 91.
FOURTH QUARTER
Chris Simms relieved Applewhite at QB and had the Longhorns on the march at
the Baylor 20 before his pass into the right flat was picked off by Bear CB
Eric Giddens, who ran it back 72 yards for Baylor's final touchdown to cut
the UT lead to 34-14, with 11:14 left. Backup TBs Victor Ike and Kenny Hayt=
er
alternated short runs and Simms went 3-for-3 for 24 yards before Hayter got
another UT touchdown on a one-yard plunge. Stockton's kick gave Texas a 41-=
14
lead with 6:11 left. The Longhorn backups scored again on their next
possession driving 72 yards in eight plays, with Simms hitting freshman WR
Sloan Thomas for 45 yards and Ike getting the final 10 yards for the
touchdown on a fourth-down play. Stockton's kick brought the final score to
48-14 with 2:04 left.

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday the Longhorns "played really well" defensively
against Baylor, but "we just weren't in sync" on offense.
After viewing the game tapes, he said the Longhorns are facing a tough fina=
l
three regular season games and will have to play much better to have a chan=
ce
to win.
"For us to win the next three weeks, we need to be more balanced," Brown
said. "We need to be able to run the ball."
He also said the Longhorns are more physical than they were early in the
year, but he said they need to be more physical, particularly in being able
to run the ball.
"Baylor put a lot of guys around the line of scrimmage and made it harder f=
or
us to run the ball," he said. "But we still should have been more physical
and we should have been able to run the ball."
"The best thing we did offensively was pass protect," he said. "The offensi=
ve
line did a tremendous job of picking up all the blitzes."
He also praised tackles Leonard  Davis and Mike Williams, saying they are
playing extremely well.
Running the ball successfully, he said, "is an attitude. When you take
linemen the size of ours and keep pounding, they (the opposing linemen) get
tired."
"Our staff has taken the position that we're going to make the run work,
regardless of how many are stacked in there," he said. " We'll just hang in
there and keep working at it."
Brown said the coaches decided to play freshman DT Adam Doiron because Shau=
n
Rogers is still hampered by a sprained ankle, Ryan Haywood is out for the
year with a shoulder injury and Stevie Lee might be out for the year with a=
n
ankle injury.
Asked how Doiron played, he said, "He played really well. He was in there f=
or
13 plays and he had four tackles, and he got in the right place on just abo=
ut
every play. I think he has a chance to be a real good player."
Brown said Doiron "has wanted to play all year. We'll get a minimum of five
games from him. Sometimes you have to play some freshmen when you have
injuries. It was at about this time last year that we started playing Bo
Scaife."
Playing Scaife from mid-season on last year worked out well because he
suffered a torn ACL during two-a-day workouts.
He was lost for this season, which will be counted as his redshirt year,
making him a sophomore in eligibility again next season.
True freshman TE Brock Edwards got his first start because Mike Jones is ou=
t
for the year with a torn ACL. Brown said, "I thought Brock did a really goo=
d
job for his first game to start. He dropped his first ball, but then made a
great catch in the corner and ran well after he caught it."
Brown said redshirt freshman DT Marcus Tubbs "played his best game."
Tubbs has been starting while Shaun Rogers has been limited with a sprained
ankle. He had a sack and three tackles for losses Saturday.

Doiron Ninth True Freshman to Play

Defensive tackle Adam Doiron played Saturday against Baylor and he is the
ninth true freshman to see action this year.
Four true freshmen are starting. They are tight end Brock Edwards, defensiv=
e
end Kalen Thorn-ton and wide receivers Roy Williams and B. J. Johnson.
CB Nathan Vasher has started when the Longhorns open with a nickel defense
(five defensive backs).
Other true freshman who have played are defensive tackle Stevie Lee, safety
Phillip Geiggar and wide receive Sloan Thomas.
Coach Mack Brown said he probably will redshirt the remainder of the freshm=
an
class.
Fullback Will Matthews has been impressive on the scout team and probably
would have played this season, but he was bothered by severe headaches duri=
ng
the early drills and that set him back.
Other freshmen who are redshirting, but who are drawing praise from the
starters for their work on the scout teams are QB Chance Mock, RB Sneezy
Beltran, WR Tony Jeffery, OT Lionel Garr and LB Austin Sendlein.
The current UT freshman class was rated as high as No. 4 in the country by
the various recruiting services, and it came on the heels of a 1999 class
that was a runaway choice as the best class in the country.
The 1999 class was headed by Cory Redding and Chris Simms, the USA Today
defensive and offensive players of the year.
That was a great class and it is living up to its press clippings.
Redding is starting, TE Bo Scaife was to start before his knee injury, OGs
Derrick Dockery and Tillman Holloway have started, CB Roderick Babers is a
starter and so is safety Dakarai Pearson. DT Marcus Tubbs also has started.
But I think the current freshman class is even better, with four players
starting as true freshmen and several more playing key roles.
Williams already holds the yardage record for Longhorn freshmen receivers,
and Johnson is third and holds the freshman single game yardage record.
They are the two best freshmen wide receivers I have ever seen, and Thomas
and Jeffery make it a great foursome because they are outstanding receivers=
,
too.
The Longhorns will be a lot better next year than they are this year becaus=
e
all of those top freshmen and sophomores will be a year older and will have
one more year of experience.
But just think how good they will be when those two classes are juniors and
seniors and are backed up by the outstanding class the coaches are recruiti=
ng
right now and the one they will get next year.

Injury Update

Offensive guard Antwan Kirk-Hughes was held out of the Baylor game to give
his sore shoulder a rest, and he probably will be able to play at Texas Tec=
h
Saturday.
The knee injury TE Mike Jones suffered turned out to be a torn ACL, so he
will undergo surgery and will be out for the rest of the season.
That leaves freshman Brock Edwards as the only healthy tight end. Fullback =
Cha
d Stevens, a former tight end, has been working at both positions.
Safety Lee Jackson suffered a leg injury in the Baylor game and is
questionable for Saturday.
Freshman defensive tackle Stevie Lee, who underwent foot surgery to repair =
a
broken bone about a month ago, is due to be examined again this week to see
if he can return this season.
Lee is eligible for a medical redshirt year if he is unable to play again
this season.
Redshirt freshman wide receiver Artie Ellis is having problems with the sam=
e
shin injury that hampered him during spring practice. He had a stress
fracture then, and the same shin is sore again. He is not expected to play =
at
Tech.
Others who are likely to miss the Tech game are  outside linebacker O. J.
McClintock (sprained knee) and defensive tackle Ryan Haywood (shoulder
injury.)

Brown Says Offensive Line Much Improved, Cites Other Problems Heading into
2-a-Days

Coach Mack Brown says he and his assistant coaches have thoroughly reviewed
the tapes of the Longhorns 15 spring practices and have concluded it was a
very productive period.
The offensive line has received much of the blame for the late-season
Longhorn swoon last year, but Brown says the offensive linemen, as a group,
showed a lot more maturity and perseverance in the spring.
"I think the offensive line improved a lot," he told me in an interview las=
t
week.
Asked what he thought prompted the improvement, he said, "The embarrassment
they felt leaving the Cotton Bowl and the fact that they have been together=
 a
year more."
While he didn't elaborate on the maturity question, it is worth noting that
four of the five offensive linemen who started in the spring have never
redshirted.
The reason they never redshirted is the lack of  depth in the offensive lin=
e
when they got here, which forced Brown to play most of the linemen when the=
y
were true freshmen.
At Nebraska, which has been the top program in the Big 12 year in and year
out, all offensive linemen redshirt and most of them don't start until thei=
r
fourth year when they are redshirt juniors.
Applying that yardstick to the Texas' offensive line, none of the four spri=
ng
starters would have started last year, and only senior LT Leonard Davis and
junior center Matt Anderson would start this year because they are entering
their fourth seasons.
There are exceptions, even at Nebraska, because their center last season wa=
s
a third-year sophomore, but the Huskers =01) and the other teams who seem t=
o
always be in the hunt for the national championship =01) go mostly with
fourth-and-fifth-year players (redshirted juniors and seniors) in their
offensive lines.
The five offensive line starters at Nebraska this spring already have 18
seasons in the Husker program under their belts. The Longhorns' five spring
starters have 11.
The Longhorns should be able to able to overcome their youth to some extent
because four of the spring starters =01) Davis, Anderson, junior RG Antwan
Kirk-Hughes and junior RT Mike Williams =01) all started last season, and
sophomore LG Derrick Dockery played often and well last year as a true
freshman.
That means they know what it takes to win and have the experience to help
them do it.
Brown did say he thinks the Longhorns can redshirt their offensive line
recruits this year "if we can avoid injuries." That bodes well for the futu=
re.
But, when the Horns start 2-a-days in early August, Brown said there are fo=
ur
problem areas where major improvements must be made for the Longhorns to be
able to compete at the highest level =01) and only one of them directly inv=
olves
the offensive line.
"First, he said, "we need to do a better job of net punting."
"Second, we need to do a better job returning punts and kickoffs."
"Third, we need to do a better job of making four-yard plays consistently o=
n
offense. That will help with ball control and will help take the pressure o=
ff
our passing game."
"Fourth, we need to do better job of getting a good pass rush out of our
front four."
The Longhorns made a lot of progress in the spring in each of those areas,
but Brown said they have to keep working hard in each area to get even bett=
er.
Former walk-on Ryan Long, who handled the punting last season, and Kris
Stockton, the Horns' regular place kicker, both worked hard on punting duri=
ng
the spring and both were able to get good heighth and good distance on most
of their kicks.
But look for incoming freshman punter Justin Smith to get a chance to win t=
he
starting job.
Even more improvement was shown in the spring in the other three areas.
CB Ahmad Brooks showed promise as a punt returner in the spring and redshir=
t
freshman RB Ivan Williams looked very good as a kickoff returner.
They should enable the Horns to be  better in both kick return areas if the=
y
improve as much during 2-a-days as they did in the 15 spring practices.
Williams also is the main hope of showing improvement in problem area No. 3=
 =01)
doing a better job of making consistent four-yard gains. He is a 235-pounde=
r
with speed and power and he can catch the ball, too.
One important thing to remember about big running backs, in addition to the
obvious characteristics, is the fact that offensive linemen tend to block
better for them because they want to get out of their way.
If you ever played in the offensive line at any level and had a big running
back step on the back of your legs because you didn't get out of his way,
you'll know why they make an extra effort to get a good block when they kno=
w
a 235-pounder is coming through their area.
While the coaches saw some things they liked in those first three areas, No=
.
4 =01) getting a better pash rush out of the front four =01) was a big-time=
 winner
the spring and should get even better during the pre-season practices.
Why? For starters, the best pair of tackles in all of college football retu=
rn
in seniors Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers. Hampton is a returning
All-American and Rogers is rated even higher by the pro scouts.
Rogers is a great pass rusher and Hampton, the team's best run stopper, is =
a
good one.
And sophomore end Cory Redding is a future All-American who is an outstandi=
ng
pass rusher, and, while the coaches aren't satisfied the play of the guys a=
t
the other end, all three of them =01) Jermain Anderson, Maurice Gordon and =
Adam
McConathy =01) are very good at rushing the passer. Their problem is holdin=
g up
against the run.
So, while the Longhorns have work to do to reach the playing level the
coaches demand, they have a very good chance to do a lot better in all of t=
he
categories Brown mentioned except net punting, and they should be able to
show some improvement there because it isn't too hard to improve on a 29-ya=
rd
net punting average that ranked 111th of 114 teams playing Division I
football.
Here's what Brown had to say on several other subjects:
Do you expect Major Applewhite to be ready to go full speed when practice
starts in early August? Doctors usually say it takes about nine months and =
he
was operated on in mid-January, so he'll only have about seven months until
practice starts.
"I don't know," he said. "I've been around long enough, and I've had five o=
f
them (knee operations) myself, to know that sometimes you seem to be ahead =
of
schedule and then things seem to go a little slower. There are still some
questions and concerns there and we'll just have to wait and see."
After studying the film of the 15 spring practices, who were your most
pleasant surprises?
"There were a lot of pleasant surprises. Beau Baker had a good spring and i=
s
challenging Matt Anderson at center. We expected (redshirt freshman) Artie
Ellis to be pretty good, but he really jumped out and showed he has the
potential to help at wide receiver."
"Ivan Williams probably came farther than anybody. Matt Trissel had a good =
spr
ing at fullback. Leonard Davis had his best spring, by far (at offensive
tackle)."
"On defense, Jermain Anderson came back at 228 pounds and in good health an=
d
he looked good at end. We're working to get him a little bigger. D. D. Lewi=
s
had by far his best spring (at middle linebacker) and Reed Boyd, backing hi=
m
up, had a great spring, too."
"Quentin Jammer had a real good spring until he got hurt, but he looked
really good at corner. Dakarai Pearson looked real good at free safety."
"It wasn't any surprise, but those two defensive tackles are real good,"
"What's your biggest concern about having to play 11 straight games without
an open date?
"We're going to have to play a lot of people. We felt like we got worn down
last year at the end of the season, and we've worked to build better depth =
so
we can play more people. We're going to do that to try to keep our people
fresher."
Let's talk about the chances of some of those heralded freshman wide
receivers helping out early.
"Well, a guy can play there quicker. It's less physical than most of the
other positions. The main thing will be learning how to handle the
bump-and-ran coverage. We're telling them to come in ready to compete for
playing time."

Hall Will Transfer

Redshirt freshman QB Adam Hall has asked for and has been granted an
unconditional release and plans to transfer to another school this summer.
Hall, an Austin Westlake product, was the backup to sophomore Chris Simms
during spring practice while junior Major Applewhite was recovering from
major knee surgery.
He had a very good spring, and was really adept at throwing on the run.
His departure will leave the Longhorns with just three scholarship
quarterbacks this season =01) Applewhite, Simms and incoming freshman Chanc=
e
Mock of The Woodlands.
And that is based on the assumption that Applewhite's knee will be strong
enough to allow him to be ready at the start of the season.
"It was a difficult decision, but one that I think is the best for me at th=
is
time," Hall said. "The biggest factor was that I want to have a chance to b=
e
a starter in the near future."
"I love all of my teammates and appreciate everything the coaches and staff
have done for me, but I think I will have a better opportunity to play soon=
er
at another school."
"Obviously we are disappointed because we felt that Adam had a good spring
and we have been very pleased with his progress," Brown said.
"We wish him the very best and appreciate everything he has done for the
University of Texas and its football program."

Revisiting the Offense

After looking at the statistics of all of last season's game, I feel much
better about the Texas offense.
Through the first 11 games last season, UT was averaging 448 yards a game a=
nd
had the league's second-ranked offense. Texas also had been outgained only
once, in the  win over Nebraska.
But QB Major Applewhite was healthy and WRs Kwame Cavil and Ryan Nunez were
teaming up to outgain 1998's dynamic duo of Wane McGarity and Cavil. Jeremy
Jones was also providing quality time at WR.
Against good defenses, they were the straws that stirred the Longhorn offen=
se.
When the offensive meltdown occurred in the last three games, injuries to
Nunez and Jones, Applewhite's illness before the A&M game and Cavil's
suspension before the Arkansas game kept them from ever being being all
together again.
Fear of those potent weapons had kept teams from blitzing effectively, but,
with one or more of those weapons missing in each of last three games, team=
s
were able to blitz too many people to block without fear of getting burned
deep.
I doubt Texas could have beaten Nebraska a second time in one year, but I'd
like to have played A&M and Arkansas with everybody healthy.
It's true that those receivers are gone, but TE Bo Scaife and a bigger,
faster corps of WRs will make all-out blitzing much more dangerous for othe=
r
teams. Look for a return to those 400-plus-yard offensive averages in 2000.

The Pre-Season Blue Chips

Here's my revised list of the top Texas football recruits. The ones in bold
type are my early Fabulous 40. I decided to run the list again this month
because there are so many changes in the wake of the Nike camps and early
college scouting. I also trimmed the list from 100 to 80 because I wanted t=

limit it to kids who are being heavily recruited by Division I schools.
(Note to E-Mail Subscribers: I have put four asterisks (****) between the F=

Mihm Turns Pro; Barnes Cupboard Far from Bare

All-America center Chris Mihm announced Friday he is passing up his senior
season at Texas to follow his life-long dream of playing in the NBA.
"It was a tough choice because I love the program at UT, but I believe I'm
doing what makes the most sense," Mihm said.
Mihm, who led the Longhorns in scoring, rebounding and blocked shots last
season, is projected as a top five pick in the NBA draft next month.
If  Mihm had returned for his senior season, the Longhorns probably would
have been a pre-season top 10 team, but coach Rick Barnes' cupboard if far
from bare and they should be a top 20 team without him.
Among the six returning lettermen are 6-8 junior forward Chris Owens, a pow=
er
in the paint, and 6-3 senior guard Darren Kelly, a sharpshooter and strong
defender.
Other lettermen include sophomore forward William Wyatt, sophomore guard/fo=
rwa
rd Chris Ogden, sophomore guard Roosevelt Brown and senior guard Chris
McColpin.
But Barnes' ace in the hole is transfer guard Maurice Evans, a 6-5 junior
dynamo who practiced with the team last season after averaging 22.6 points =
a
game as a sophomore at Wichita State.
Evans has been very impressive in practice and he, like Mihm, has big-time
NBA potential. Barnes' offense is not as wide open as Wichita State's, but
look for Evans to average 16 or 17 points a game and be one of the team's b=
ig
guns, offensively and defensively, next season.
Barnes also has six recruits coming in, including heralded JC point guard
Freddie Williams, plus four national top 100 recruits in 6-9 forward Brian
Boddicker of Duncanville, 6-8 forward James Thomas of Hargrave Military
Academy in Chatham, Virginia, 6-5 swingman Brandon Mouton of Lafayette, La.=
,
and 6-10, 255-pound center
Jason Klotz of Houston Klein Forest.
Guard Lawrence Williams announced plans to transfer two weeks ago and Barne=
s
filled the scholarship by signing Royal Ivey, a 6-3, 175-pound guard from
Blair Academy, a prep school in Blairstown, N. J.
Joe Montegna, Ivey's coach at Blair, said the Longhorns picked up a real ge=
m.
"He averaged 20 points, 5 rebounds and 6 assists for us," Montegna said.
"He's a fine offensive player who is a true combo guard, but he's much bett=
er
on defense."
He's the best defensive player, by far, that I've ever coached, and I've
coached in the college ranks," Montegna said.

Missouri Game Set for 1:30, No TV; Baylor Game Gets TV at 11:30

After doing some on-air promos on the Texas-Missouri game, ABC opted
instead
to televise the Texas A&M-Iowa State game, so the Saturday game in Austin
between Texas and Missouri will start at 1:30 p.m. and will NOT  be
televised.
The Baylor game in Austin the following week will be televised by the Fox
Network and will begin at 11:30 a.m.
No pay per view will be available on Texas-Missouri because ABC's contract
with the Big 12 prohibits members of the Big 12 from televising a game in
the
same time frame with the ABC network game. Texas set the time at 1:30 p.m.,
which would conflict with the telecast of the A&M-Iowa State game.
The next road game is at Texas Tech on Nov. 4, and it should be televised,
but we won't know for sure until next Monday (the infamous 12-day window
the
networks require).
* * * *
Coach Mack Brown said Monday he thinks the Longhorns will fare better now
that the coaches have simplified the offense and settled on a starting
quarterback.
"When I was at North Carolina and used two quarterbacks, we had more
experienced people around them," he said. "I think we just need to simplify
as much as we can and just let them play."
He said that was the game plan at Colorado and he said that is the way the
coaches will prepare the team for the Missouri game.
Brown said he also thinks the two-back offense is better for Texas for
several reasons. He said having two backs behind the quarterback improves
the
pass protection. When teams rush eight defenders, he  said the five
linemen,
the tight end and one running back have one more rusher than there are
blockers. When two backs are there, he said there are enough people to
block
everyone, even in a maximum blitz. Oklahoma kept two backs in early against
Texas to protect Josh Heupel from the Texas rush. It obviously worked
pretty
well for the Sooners, and it worked for the Longhorns Saturday in Boulder.
It also is a better power-running formation because of the extra blocker,
he
said, adding that success in the running game causes the other team's
safeties to creep up to help stop the run. He said that causes "one-on-one
coverage on the wide receivers and also lets the tight end slip out
easier."
He said the Longhorns' running success at Colorado was a major reason for
all
the long completions to wide receivers and to TE Mike Jones having such
success.
"When you can run and pass, it creates some problems for the defense," he
said. "We plan to keep working on being able to do both."
True freshman WR B. J. Johnson went along with the simplification idea,
while
having some fun with the rerporters on hand. Johnson said when he first got
to Texas and "heard the coaches talking about cover 6 . . . I didn't even
know they had six coverages.
When someone asked him if he knew all the defensive coverages now, he said,
"I don't even know all the plays, to tell you to truth. You should see our
playbook."
He was asked if life was simpler back when he first starting playing
football. "In pee-wee ball, we might have had 10 plays, and they all
worked,"
he said. Everybody, including B. J., laughed.
* * * *
BASKETBALL RECRUITING: T. J. Ford, the 5-11, 160-pound point guard at
defending state 5A champion Fort Bend Willowridge, has made his college
choice, but he won't reveal it until a  5:45 p.m. Wednesday press
conference
at Harlem Elementary School in Baytown. The Longhorns have a great shot,
but
he also has taken visits to Louisville, Memphis State and Houston and could
wind up picking one of them. The Longhorns have only two scholarships to
award this year and Chris Wright, a  6-10 center at Redwater, committed
last
year. So, if Ford comes aboard, the Longhorns would sign Wright and Ford on
November  8, the first day of the early signing period, and that would wrap
up their class.

Hey Baby,

I dont know if this email looks like it's from me.  Anyway, I'm REALLY
tired.  I got probably about 6.5 hours of sleep but I guess it wasn't
enough.  It's gonna be a long week - okay 4 days.  I'm sorry about
waking you up last night.  I'm meeting Jen Garcia at 1 to work on the
project, but I should be home around 6.

Have fun working out tonight!  I will call you when I get home, but I
will try to email you again!

Love you,
Jenn

By the way-did you email my mom?

Are you sure that the bruise is from me? I don't understand how there
can be a bruise.  And why is showing up today?  If it's really my fault,
I'm sorry.  My point wasn't to hurt you.  I'm going to study now....

Love you,

No What-Iffing in This One =01) Sooners Turn
Longhorns Every Which Way but Loose

The Longhorns had their worst day during the Mack Brown era Saturday in
Dallas and they picked a bad time to do it because unbeaten Oklahoma scored
on its first six possessions, and, for good measure, ran a pass back for a
touchdown, too, en route to a 63-14 victory.
The Sooners dominated the Longhorns offensively, defensively and on special
teams. They even won the halftime, when a Billy Sims-led relay team beat an
Eric Metcalf-led relay team.
QB Josh Huepel passed the Longhorns to death and 5-7, 193-pound sophomore R=
B
Quentin Griffin broke Oklahoma's school scoring record =01) and Longhorn fa=
ns'
hearts =01) with six touchdowns.
In short, it just wasn't a good day to be a Texas fan =01) in the cold, dam=
p
Cotton Bowl or anywhere.
The loss dropped Texas to 4-2 for the season and 1-1 in the Big 12 and gave
the Sooners a big boost in their drive toward national and Big 12 honors.
It also made this Saturday's game with Colorado in Boulder the biggest game
of the year. This is a season on the brink. It could go up or down. Remembe=
r
that 66-3 debacle with UCLA that started the slide in John Mackovic's last
year?
Brown is made of sterner stuff and I think he can get this team back on
track. But he has to do it in a hurry.
One thing Longhorn fans need to be very thankful about is that Heupel is a
senior. He was absolutely awesome Saturday and he probably will be the best
all-around quarterback the Longhorns will face this year.
Here, even more briefly than usual, is how the game went:
FIRST QUARTER
Oklahoma won  the toss and deferred. Texas took the ball and the Sooners go=
t
the wind. A false-start penalty on the game's second snap doomed that drive
and forced a quick punt into the wind. Kris Stockton got a good roll on the
low kick to the OU 43. Heupel hit four of five passes to cover the 57 yards
in six plays to give OU a 7-0 lead with 11:37 left. TB Hodges Mitchell made=
 a
great run after catching Applewhite's third-down pass to pick up a UT first
down =01) but it was the only one in the first quarter.  On their second tr=
y,
the Sooners went 77 yards in 11 plays and ran the score to 14-0 with 3:30
left. A  holding penalty on the kickoff forced Texas to start frrom its 8.
Another three-and-out series and punt out of the end zone gave the Sooners =
a
short field at the UT 43. They were on the move again at the UT 29 when the
period ended.
SECOND QUARTER
The UT defense got a great leaping interception in the end zone from CB
Quentin Jammer, but it was disallowed and he was called for pass interferen=
ce
instead, giving OU a first down at the 2. They scored on the next play for =
a
21-0 lead with 14:24 left. Starting QB Major Applewhite almost connected wi=
th
freshman WR Roy Williams for a 45-yard completion, but the officials ruled =
he
lost the ball on the way down and it was ruled incomplete. The Horns couldn=
't
make a first down and J. T. Thatcher ran Stockton's punt back 53 yards to t=
he
UT 11. A personal foul on the runback set them back to the 26, but they
scored in two plays for a 28-0 lead with 12:40 remaining. Chris Simms came =
in
at quarterback and hit Williams for a first down, but a delay-of-game penal=
ty
negated it and Simms' next pass was intercepted by OU LB Rocky Calmus, who
returned it for still another OU touchdown and a 35-0 lead with 11:30
remaining. That brought Applewhite back in and he hit WR Montrell Flowers f=
or
a nice gain on first down, but an illegal motion penalty forced a punt. The
Sooners scored again, giving them a 42-0 lead with 4:43 left. At this point=
,
OU's offense had been so dominant that it had faced only seven first downs
all day and had converted all of them. Texas offense, meanwhile, had one
first down. The UT offense finally came to life, driving 80 yards in seven
plays to leave OU on top, 42-7, with 3:00 left. Mitchell got the TD from
seven yards out on a pass from Applewhite. The Sooners were driving again
when the half ended. It was their only drive in the first half that did not
result in a TD. At the half, OU led in first downs, 18-5, in rushing yardag=
e,
110-13, and in passing yardage, 182-106.
THIRD QUARTER
Texas finally forced OU to punt quickly to start the second half, but
Applewhite, under a big rush, threw an interception that was run back to th=
e
UT 24. OU scored in two plays for a 49-7 lead just 1:07 deep. Simms came ba=
ck
in at QB and played the rest of the way. OU again drove deep into Texas
territory, but freshman DE Kalen Thornton's sack of Heupel forced the Soone=
rs
to try a field goal and it went wide.  The Sooner's next TD came after a
fumble by WR Montrell Flowers at the UT 17. That made the score 56-7 with
1:26 left. Then Victor Ike, probably the swiftest of all the Longhorns, got
loose on the kickoff and Sooner DB Michael Thompson caught him from behind =
at
the OU 17. It was an 81-yard return. But the Horns lost four yards on two
plays and were facing third-and-4 at the OU 21 when the quarter ended.
FOURTH QUARTER
A pass interference penalty against OU gave Texas a first down at the  6.
Mitchell got five yards, then backup TB Kenny Hayter took an outside toss f=
or
the TD to make it 56-14 with 14:09 left. OU came right back for its final T=
D,
driving 73 yards, primarily on runs by Griffin.

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday he accepts the blame for the big loss to
Oklahoma, and he said the Longhorns have to bounce back because they still
have a season to play and a lot of goals to accomplish if they play up to
their capabilities.
"After reviewing the film, I still stand by what I said yesterday," Brown
said. "They outcoached us, they outhustled us, they outplayed us. They
totally dominated the game, and when that happens, it comes back to me. It'=
s
my fault."
But he said the team still has a chance to repeat as the Big 12 South
champion. "Last year, we were 1-1 (in the Big 12) at this point. We're at t=
he
same spot as we were last season."
Asked if he thinks the team has a chance to rebound and win the title again=
,
he said, "no question about that. We're far from out of anything. We just h=
ad
a poor, poor performance yesterday in a game that was very important for us
and our fans. For me to just throw out the season because of that would be
totally asinine."
He noted that Oklahoma, after it's loss to Texas last year, beat Texas A&M,
51-6, the following week, and Stanford, after giving up 69 points to Texas
last year, won the Pac 10 championship and Rose Bowl berth.
"There is a lot of anger after a loss like this by our fans," he said. "Wha=
t
I will do this week is not look at the paper, I won't watch TV or listen to
the radio. I'll be working hard all week trying to get us back on track."
He said he thought the Longhorns were ready to give a good performance
against the Sooners, but he said, after three straight losses to Texas, the
Oklahoma players might have just been hungrier.
"Our seniors had a chance to beat Oklahoma four straight times," he said.
"Some of them were crying. Most of our younger players were in shock."
He said a loss like this one forces coaches to re-evaluate everything. "We'=
ll
definitely go back and look very closely at everything we're doing. We'll t=
ry
to simplify things."
He said some of the Longhorn players played well, but he said most of them
"played hard, but didn't play well."
"The defense had been playing so well for us," he said. "It didn't even loo=
k
like the same defense. Part of it was (OU QB Josh) Heupel. He played great.=
"
"We had a lot of mental mistakes," Brown said. "We just played poorly and w=
ho
knows why we played that poorly? You guys will start looking at the things =
we
should change. The fans will start looking at the things we should change.
I've got to look at things that I think will work. I've got to get them bac=
k
on track."
Asked if he thinks there is a chance the team could fall apart because of t=
he
loss to the Sooners, Brown said, "This team won't fall apart. It's a very
young team with a lot of heart, a lot of class. We'll go back to work to fi=
x
things, simplify things."
He said the key thing is for him to be truthful with his players this week
about the things they did wrong, the things they did right and the goals th=
e
team still can accomplish.
"This is a bad week to be going to Boulder," he said, noting that Colorado
upset A&M in College Station last week. "We won't ever forget this (OU) gam=
e,
but we still have goals to accomplish. We're still in the race for the
championship in our conference."
"The players are embarrassed and I know I'm embarrassed, but we've got to
pull back together and get back to work. We've got to go back and make sure
we are fundamentally sound."



10th Anniversary

This is the final issue of my 10th year of publishing True Orange. Next wee=
k
will be the first issue of my 11th year. While this is not a happy occasion
because of the football game, my first issue was after a Texas win over OU
and UT is 7-3-1 against the Sooners since True Orange began.
Thanks to all of you for your continued support.

True Orange Observations

This was one of those games where a team has to  figure out what went wrong=
,
try to correct it, and then forget it because a game like this can be a
cancer that ruins a season. Remember UCLA, 66-3, and 1997?
Mack Brown won't ask for my suggestions on this, and I'm sure he can figure
it out for himself, but if I were in his shoes, here is what I would do rig=
ht
now:
1. Give a royal chewing out to my players, my assistants and myself, becaus=
e
this game was an embarrassment to all Longhorns. Then I would say there are=
 a
lot of games left to play and this game needs to be put on the shelf and th=
e
Colorado game should be the start of a new season for a team with a lot of
goals left to accomplish.
2. Figure out the few things that have worked on offense and build future
game plans around them. By the same token, I'd figure out the plays that
haven't worked and quit using them. The two up-the-gut plays the Horns used
on their first two plays Saturday for zero yards have been unproductive all
year. Texas rarely has a running play outside the tackles, but the sweeps
usually work when they are tried. I'd also ditch that sideline pass that
travels 30 yards for a potential 1-yard gain =01) or an interception for a =
TD =01)
and start throwing downfield more often. To open the game against Oklahoma
State, the Longhorns had a four-yard run and two pass completions on their
first three plays and didn't pick up a first down.
3. Pick a QB and go with him. Each QB has to be nervous, knowing that if he
throws an interception, he'll be jerked.
4. Quit being so predictable on offense. Example: when the Horns line up in=
 a
two-back offense and the tailback goes in motion, Texas has passed or been
sacked trying to pass 100% of the time this season. There has been one run =
by
a UT fullback all year =01) Brett Robin's touchdown in mop-up duty against =
OSU.
That formation invites an all-out blitz.
5. If the run isn't going to be a big part of the offense, go to the shotgu=
n
with four wideouts as the basic formation. It gives the quarterback a bette=
r
chance to complete his passes, as OU QB Josh Heupel demonstrated to near
perfection Saturday.
Game Notes . .
* Oklahoma QB Josh Heupel, one of the nation's top passers, had 34 net yard=
s
rushing Saturday, which was more than the 20 yards gained by the Longhorns'
leading ground gainer, TB Hodges Mitchell.
* This was the second most one-sided game in the series, trailing only the
50-0 Oklahoma victory in in 1908. Texas leads the series, 55-35-5.
* The Sooners 534 yards and 28 first downs are both school records against
the Longhorns.
* This was the fifth most one-sided defeat in Texas history. The bottom 10
are:
1.  1904    at Chicago      68-0
2.  1997    UCLA            66-3
3.  1988    Houston     66-15
4.  1908    at Oklahoma 50-0
5.  2000    Oklahoma        63-14
6.  1901    at Kirksville   48-0
7.  1956    at TCU          46-0
8.  1906    at Vanderbilt   45-0
9.  1956    Oklahoma        45-0
10. 1991    Miami           46-3

Baseball Team Starts Practice

The Longhorn baseball begins fall practice Wednesday with 12 lettermen back
from last year's team that qualified for the College World Series.
The team will practice through Oct. 27, and the annual Fall World Series wi=
ll
be played from Oct. 25 through Oct. 27.
All the practices will be open at Disch-Falk Field, and all the practices
will be in the afternoon, but exact times have not been announced.
Coach Augie Garrido and his assistants corraled the nation's fifth-rated
recruiting class last year, and there are several pitchers in the new class
who should be able to help the team this year.

Scouting Missouri

Texas will play at Missouri Saturday in a game that will start at 1 p.m. and,
despite prior announcements, will not be televised - not even on a pay per
view basis.
The Longhorns, ranked No. 7 in both polls, are 6-1, while the Tigers are
unranked at 3-3.
Missouri opened the season with a 20-13 loss to Bowling Green, then thumped
Southwest Texas, 40-6, before getting mauled by Nebraska, 36-3.
Then the Tigers beat Oklahoma State, 41-38, in a triple overtime, before
losing to Iowa State, 20-14, and then outscoring Kansas 38-34.
Tiger QB Kirk Farmer has had a hot hand in recent weeks, and he kept both
teams in the game last week, blistering Kansas with 246 yards and three
touchdowns passing, plus another 82 rushing yards. But he also had two
interceptions run back for touchdowns.
Farmer, a 6-5, 210-pound junior, has completed 73 of 147 passes for 804 yards
and 8 touchdowns, but he was very productive in the Tigers' three most recent
games.
He also is a slippery runner who is a great scrambler.
WR Justin Gage, a 6-5, 205-pound junior, is one of the nation's most
productive pass receivers. He has caught 45 passes for 518 yards and 3 TDs
and ranks second in the Big 12 in receptions per game with a 7.5 average.
RB Zack Abron, a 5-10, 230-pound sophomore,  is the main threat on the
ground. He has rushed 94 times for 453 yards and 5 TDs. That's an average of
4.8 yards per carry.
New coach Gary Pinkel inherited eight offensive and six defensive starters
from a 3-8 team, and he has shifted players around, particularly on defense,
to try to get more speed on the field.
I had to use Big 8 statistics in my team comparisons this week because the
NCAA defensive statistics and rankings were not available at press time.
As you can see from the statistics below, the Longhorns appear to be far
superior to the Tigers.
This is a game the Longhorns should win and will win if they:
1. Avoid costly turnovers
2. Keep on running the ball to provide more offensive balance
3. Get their usual great defensive game.

Here's how the teams compare statistically (Big 12 rank in parenthesis):
Texas                    Missouri
Offense
(5)     165.9        Rushing Avg.          (6)   165
(2)     237.1        Passing Avg.          (8)   176.2
(4)     403     Total Off. Avg.        (8)   341.2

Big 12 Roundup

The Big 12 is down to two teams with perfect records and one of those will
fall Saturday when Nebraska plays host to Oklahoma.
Both unbeaten powerhouses struggled in their games last week, undoubtedly
because their thoughts kept drifting to the big showdown in Lincoln.
Iowa State travels to Texas A&M in another key conference game because both
clubs are 3-1 in league play.

Buckman Close to Decision

Brad Buckman, the 6-8 Austin Westlake forward who is the object of the big
recruiting battle between Texas and North Carolina, is very close to making
his choice.
In fact, two North Carolina internet sites claim he has already made it and
the Tar Heels are the winners.
Buckman isn't saying. He says he has always been a Texas fan, but really
likes North Carolina and the ACC because basketball is so important in that
area.

Top Women Visit

Center LaToya Davis, 6-2, of Houston South Houston, took her official visit
to Texas last weekend after visiting Texas Tech the previous week.
Davis, the state's top uncommitted player, has narrowed her choices to those
two schools and is expected to make her decision this week.
Three top juniors also took unofficial visits to Texas the same weekend. They
are Kalee Carey, 6-5, of Canyon, 6-1 Destiny Drew of Crosby and 6-0 Emily
Niemann of Houston Westbury Christian.


UT Men, Women Picked 5th

The Longhorns aren't getting alot of respect in basketball.
The Texas men and women were both picked to finish fifth in a poll of Big 12
coaches last week.
The men's coaches picked 6-8 Chris Owens to the All-Big 12 first team and
tabbed 5-11 freshman point guard T. J. Ford as co-newcomer of the year.
The women's coaches didn't name any Longhorns to their honor teams, which
probably was a mistake because the Longhorn women were headed toward a very
good season last year when a rash of injuries destroyed their chances.
With an outstanding group of incoming recruits, the Longhorn women will have
much more depth this year.

Turnover Troubles

Texas is 6-1 and Colorado is 5-2. You knew that, didn't you?
But did you know that in the two games Colorado lost, the Buffaloes suffered
nine turnovers (five against Fresno State and four against Texas) and did not
cause a single one?
 And did you know that in the game the Longhorns lost they gave up four
turnovers against Oklahoma without gaining a single one?
What that statistic proves is that going 0-13 in turnovers is a really
sure-fire formula for going 0-3 in games.

UT Has 7 Commitments, Including At Least 3 Super Blues

The Longhorns are leading the Big 12 in recruiting for the fourth straight
year after racking up seven commitments in May and June.
Headlining the commitments are two players who are on one or more national
top 100s this year and a junior college star who was on virtually all of the
national top 100s last year.
The current top national 100 guys are DTs Earl Anderson, 6-3, 265, 4.8, of
San Marcos, and Lyle Sendlein, 6-4, 260, 4.8, of Scottsdale, Ariz., Chaparral.
Anderson, who is as explosive at the line of scrimmage of any tackle I have
seen this year, committed on May 28, and Sendlein, who is so quick he plays
middle linebacker on a team that is 28-0 the last two seasons, committed on
June 2.
The junior college star is DT Sonny Davis, 6-1, 325, 5.0, formerly of Austin
Lanier and currently of Gulf Coast JC in Mississippi. He signed with Texas
last year, but failed to qualify academically and enrolled in a JC. He says
he is ahead of schedule academically and hopes to be able to graduate in
December and enroll at Texas in January so he can go through spring training
Coach Mack Brown said signing defensive linemen was his No. 1 priority in
this year's recruiting class, and this trio gives him a great start toward
accomplishing that goal.
The Longhorns' first commitment was from outstanding run blocker Brett
Valdez, 6-4, 310, 5.2, of Brownwood on April 7.
The commitments since my last newsletter are athlete Clint Haney, 5-11, 185,
4.27 (Nike camp time at A&M), of Smithson Valley, and QB Billy Don Malone,
6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7,of Paris North Lamar, both on June 11, and WR Dustin
Miksch, 6-0, 167, 4.35 (Nike camp time at A&M), of Round Rock Westwood on
June 14.
While the more recent commitments are not as heralded as the earlier ones,
they obviously were impressive at UT's summer camps. Donald Burgs, the
outstanding cornerback from Houston Madison, told me last Wednesday night
that Miksch was the best wide receiver at the camp that ended earlier that day
.
The following day, Miksch committed to the Longhorns.
It also didn't hurt that Miksch ran a 4.35 40 at the A&M Nike camp and a 4.4
at the UT camp and Haney ran a 4.27 40 at the same Nike camp and a 4.4 at the
Texas camp.
Malone is not as much of a sleeper as the other two. He's a two-time Class 4A
All-District quarterback and safety, and he was the sophomore of the year in
the district both offensively and defensively.
He has receivers who can catch the ball, but they don't dazzle anyone with
their speed. When defensive backs aren't worried about receivers' speed, they
cover them as tightly as they can, knowing that if they lose a step, it will
be easy to get it back.
That makes the quarterback's job a lot harder and can lead to more
interceptions. But Malone completed 106 of 202 passes (52.4%) for 1,649 yards
and 15 touchdowns for a 6-4 team. He had seven interceptions. He also ran for
405 yards and four touchdowns.
Malone said he chose Texas over Tennessee, Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa State,
TCU and SMU. He said ISU, TCU and SMU had offered, and North Lamar head coach
Tom Felty said Tennessee, Arkansas and Colorado coaches had told him they
were preparing to offer.
"He has a great arm," Felty said, "but what really makes him special is the
way he sees the entire field. He can find his second and third receivers and
he never just locks onto one guy."
"He's also a very physical player," Felty said.  "That's what makes him such
a fine free safety, and it also helps him at quarterback because he will hang
in there until the last split second to get a completion even when he knows
he's going to get decked."
Haney said he picked the Longhorns over Texas Tech and Colorado (offers) and
several other schools who  were recruiting him.
He rushed 266 times for 1,665 yards (6.25 yards per carry) and 19 touchdowns,
and also was a big threat as a receiver, catching 9 passes for 205 yards and
four touchdowns for the 11-2 Rangers.
He said when he committed, "Coach Brown said they were recruiting me as a
football player. He told me they want fast, athletic kids and they would find
a spot for me after I get there."
That spot probably will be wide receiver or defensive back.
Smithson Valley defeated San Marcos in the Class 4A playoffs last year, and
Haney said San Marcos' defensive tackle Earl Anderson, another UT pledge, "is
really fast to be so big. I broke about a 40-yard touchdown run in that game
and he was right behind me most of the way. I'm glad we're going to be on the
same side at Texas."
In addition to those fast 40 times Miksch ran at the summer camps, he also
blazed to  a 10.53 100 meters last track season.
Miksch, the son of former Longhorn WR Ronnie Miksch, a 1977-78 letterman from
Needville, said Purdue, Nebraska, A&M, Notre Dame and Oklahoma were all
recruiting him.
He said Purdue and Nebraska coaches had invited him to their summer camps.
"I'll have to call both of them and tell them I won't be coming to their
camps," he said.
He caught 46 passes for 676 yards and five touchdowns for the 4-6 Warriors
last season.
When Anderson and Sendlein committed earlier, along with Davis' recommitment,
it gave the Longhorns a fine start toward a great defensive line class.
All three are physical players who have great quickness to go with their size
and athleticism. They also all play very hard all the time.
Anderson is the highest ranked Texas blue-chipper to pick a college. He is
No. 3 on my 25-man "difference-maker" list. Sendlein is the top recruit in
Arizona and, if he lived in Texas, he would be high in my top 25. Davis was
No. 5 on my "difference maker" list last year.
Anderson, who says he has grown an inch to 6-4 and now weighs 275, told me
can still break 4.8 in the 40 on most days.
"I ran a  4.78 the last time I was clocked," he said. "I want to stay below
4.8, so I'm watching my weight now." I was the first guy to give him a high
ranking after seeing his incredible quickness last season.
He said he picked Texas over Texas A&M, Florida State and others because UT
"has the great combination of athletics and academics that I want and it's so
close that my parents won't have to spend a lot of money traveling around to
see me play."
Besides that, he said, "I've always been a Longhorn fan."
Sendlein comes from such a Longhorn family that his UT linebacker brother is
named Austin. Their father, Robin, was a great linebacker at Texas and also
played in the NFL for many years.
Sendlein said he is 6-5, 275, and can run the 40 in 4.8. His Scottsdale team
has gone 14-0 two straight years and his prowess as a defender is one of the
main reasons for the team's success.
Sendlein was being recruited by all the top schools in the Pac 10, plus Notre
Dame, Nebraska, Michigan and Penn State.
* * * *
Another great defensive line prospect, Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel,
came in at 6-4 1/2 and 261 and ran a 4.8 40 at a Nike camp at LSU recently,
and he also bench pressed 185 pounds 36 times. No one else at the camp was
able to bench press 185 pounds more than 22 times. Pittman bench pressed 440
pounds, a tremendous achievement for a high school junior, at a recent
charity fund raising event at Evangel.
He is the younger brother of Cole Pittman, the former UT defensive linemen
who was killed in a tragic auto accident earlier this year while returning to
Texas for spring training. He is considering Texas and LSU.
Chase and his father, Marc Pittman, came to one of the Longhorn camp sessions
on June 6, and several other Evangel stars accompanied them, including John
David Booty, a  6-2, 195-pound quarterback who might be the nation's top
sophomore prospect, and another outstanding sophomore, DE Chris Bowers, 6-3,
232, 4.6. He also brought two top Evangel defensive backs who are being
highly recruited from Evangel. They are Jonathan Wade, 5-10, 175, 4.3 (he ran
a 10.25 100 meters in April), and Chad Johnson, 5-11, 185, 4.4.

RECRUITING NOTES: Trivia Question - The speed-rushing DE Longhorn coaches and
their cohors everywhere want to sign lives 550 miles or so northeast of
Austin, but his grandmother and two uncles live in Austin and he took an u
nofficial visit to Austin recently. Who is he? If you guessed Bryan Pickryl,
6-5, 230, 4.5, of Jenks (suburban Tulsa), Oklahoma, you are a certified
recruiting junkie. Pickryl has lived in Oklahoma all his life, but his father
is a UCLA grad and he says his top two schools right now are Texas and UCLA.
Look for the Sooners to be a big player here, but they will have to hurry
because he is planning to graduate in December and enroll in the college of
his choice in January. He's the top player in Oklahoma and one of the truly
great outside pass rushers in the country. . . My list on page 4 has quite a
few new names because the May evaluations by college coaches produced some
new top prospects. . . The Longhorns might sign as many as six or seven
defensive linemen and as many as four  offensive linemen in this recruiting
class because the talent base is so strong in both areas. The top offensive
line prospects the Horns are hustling are Justin Blaylock of Plano East, Tony
Ugoh of Spring Westfield and Neale Tweedie of Allen. The top defensive line
hopes include tackles Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings, Kasey Studdard of
Highlands Ranch, Colo., Marco Martin of Mesquite and Joseph Edwards of Dayton
and the top ends, in addition to Pittman and Pickryl, are Travis Leitko of
The Woodlands, Larry Dibbles of Lancaster and Dontriel Coates of Anahuac.
Coates has only played football the last two seasons, but he has great
quickness and intensity.

Baseball Roundup

Shorstop Omar Quintanilla  and pitcher Justin Simmons have been named to
Collegiate Baseball's Louisville Slugger Freshmen All-American Team.
This marks the first time Texas has had two freshman All-Amercians in the
same year.
The Longhorns were seeded third in the NCAA sub regional at Stanford in late
May. They upset No. 2 seed Long Beach State, 11-2, then stunned top-seeded
Stanford, 4-3, in the winner's bracket finale, but Stanford came back out of
the loser's bracket to beat Texas twice on May 27.
The Cardinal won the first game, 10-9, in 10 innings, then took the nightcap,
4-3. Sophomore Longhorn pitcher Ray Clark took a 3-1 lead into the eighth
inning in the second game, but sloppy fielding and mental miscues gave
Stanford three extra outs and the Cardinal scored three times.
Stanford went on to win a regional and made the finals of the College World
Series last week before losing to Miami.
The Longhorns will lose Gerrit Simpson and Albert Montes, their top two
pitchers. Both were drafted and plan to sign. They also lost one of their top
recruits, Houston Bellaire catcher James Sweeney, to the pros.
Vincent Sinisi, the slugger from The Woodlands who was the Horns' top signee
last year, has transferred to Rice. He has had persistent problems with a rib
injury.

Brown Says Offense Much Improved, Defense Very Solid

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday the Longhorns' offense should be much better
this season, and he said the defense should be his best since coming to
Texas.
Brown said the players showed up in great shape and have shown a lot of
enthusiasm in all of the early practices. He also said thd depth,
offensively
and defensively, will be better than it has been.
The offensive line is the main question mark, and Brown said flatly, "The
offensive line is much improved. There is a lot more cohesiveness. Most of
the guys were starting for the first time last year and they are much more
sure of what they need to do now that they have more experience."
He said guard Antwan Kirk-Hughes is the most improved offensive linemen,
but
he also said, "We feel like all five (offensive line starters) will be
quality
players."
The team appears to be thinner at guard than tackle on offense, but the
coaches have moved backup tackle Robbie Doane to guard. That is a sure sign
that they like the work of massive true freshman Lionel Garr at offensive
tackle. They want to have four tackles and four guards. With Leonard Davis
and Mike Williams starting at tackle and Cory Quye and Garr backing them up
and Kirk-Hughes and Derrick Dockery starting at guard and Doane and Tillman
Holloway backing them up, they get their desired two-deep. Broad also said
junior squadman Corey Bradford has been looking good at tackle. At center,
starter Matt Anderson is getting a strong challenge from Beau Baker.
Brown also has said a lot of true freshmen will play this year. "If we
think
they can help us win, they'll play," he said following a two-hour practice
session Sunday Morning. True freshman WR Roy Williams and redshirt freshman
WR Artie Ellis, both in the 6-3, 6-4 range, had outstanding practices.
Looking at the 21 freshmen, it appears likely that 14 will play. They are
Garr, WRs Roy Williams, B. J. Johnson, Sloan Thomas and Tony Jeffery, TE
Brock Edwards, DEs Adam Doiron and Kalen Thonton, DT Stevie Lee, CB Nathan
Vasher, LB Austin Sendlein, safety Phillip Geiggar, punter Justin Smith and
kicker Matt McFadden.  Brown has said he wants to use the two kickers, at
least in back-up roles, so they will have a little experience when they
take
over the two jobs next year.
TE Bo Scaife's season-ending knee injury has the coaches putting Edwards on
the fast track to get him ready to play quickly. TE coach Tim Brewster says
Edwards is picking up things very quickly. Brown said, "The thing  that Bo
gave us was great speed down the field. Brock Edwards looks pretty fast,
too,
and he's ahead of where Bo was last year because of Bo's knee." Scaife came
to Texas after undergoing surgery on his other knee.
The true freshmen who probably won't play, barring a rash of injuries at
their positions, are QB Chance Mock, RB Sneezy Beltran, FB Will Matthews,
OLs
Trey Bates and Jason Glynn,  and LBs Austin Sendlein and Rashad Thomas.
Mock,
as the third quarterback behind Chris Simms and Major Applewhite, will be
trained to be ready to play, but Brown said he hopes to redshirt him. He
has
been looking very good. Beltran and Matthews also look good, but the Horns
are deep at their positions. Brown also has said he hopes to redshirt some
offensive linemen, and Bates and Glynn are the likely candidates.
* * * *
Correction: Oh boy, when I mess up, I mess up. In last night's fax, I
quoted
a Texas coach as comparing Roy Williams favorably with Lovell Pinkney and
Mike Williams. Obviously, I meant Lovell Pinkney and Mike Adams. Sorry
about
that. Got my Mike's mixed up.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: Texas continues to lead for the state's best DT, Tommie
Harris of Killeen Ellison; best LB Derrick Johnson of Waco; best safety,
Dewayne Brandon of Temple; best RB Cedric Benson of Midland Lee; best QB
Matt
Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch, and best TE, James Moses of Galena Park
North Shore, , , The high school football season starts next week, and, for
the first time in several years, I will be able to scout five of the
state's
top players without driving very far. They are Harris, Johnson, Brandon, CB
Cedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes (a UT commitment) and QB/Athlete Quan
Cosby of Mart.

My next fax will be Monday, August 21.

Brownwood Lineman Becomes First Longhorn Pledge for New Class

The Longhorns, after wrapping up a top five national recruiting class last=20
month, got started on another bumper crop Tuesday when outstanding Brownwood=
=20
junior OL Bret Valdez. 6-4, 310, 5.1, confirmed he has committed to the UT=20
coaches.
Valdez, one of the state's great run blockers, said he went to the UT spring=
=20
game March 31 and really liked what he saw. He said the Texas coaches offere=
d=20
him a scholarship ?at the spring game.
"They told me I was the first offensive lineman they have offered this year"=
=20
he said. "I competed in the Texas Relays (he throws the shot and discus) las=
t=20
weekend, and, after I was through competing, I went over to the coaches'=20
offices and talked to coach (Mack) Brown and coaches (Tim) Nunez and (Mike)=20
Tolleson and told them I was ready to commit."
He said he also was being recruited by about 20 other schools including=20
Florida State, Texas A&M, Oklahoma, Alabama and Notre Dame. "The first time=20
they can come see us is in May and Florida State, A&M, OU, Notre Dame and=20
Alabama coaches had all told my coach they were going to come down and see m=
e=20
then."
But he said he is firmly committed to the Longhorns and will tell any other=20
coaches who contact him that he is not interested.
"Texas has really been recruiting well every year and I think they have a=20
great shot at winning a national championship in the next year or two," he=20
said. "I like the way they emphasize academics, too."
He plays tackle in Brownwood's option offense, but said he probably will be=20
tried at guard at Texas.
"I think I'll have a good chance to start after a redshirt year," he said.
The Longhorns probably will sign only three offensive line prospects next=20
February, and the coaches have not offered scholarships to any other to=20
offensive line prospects I have been talking to, so they must consider Valde=
z=20
to be the state's top OL prospect.
Brownwood went 11-2 last year, and Valdez was the team's top run blocker. He=
=20
has thrown the shot 53 feet and discus 162-7.
On tape, Valdez is a very aggressive blocker who has an explosive start that=
=20
allows him to make quick contact and then he simply drives his guy backward.=
=20
He has the quickest start of any of the big offensive line prospects I have=20
seen this year.
One of the best things about him is that he is only 16 and won't turn 17=20
until June 15, but he already benches 320 and squats 600.

RECRUITING NOTES: The Longhorns start their summer camps in just seven weeks=

UT Gets Heralded Point Guard; Horn FB Team Battling Bruises

T. J. Ford, the 5-11, 165-pound point guard who was recruited by schools
all
over the country, picked Texas Wednesday, saying he wants to play
basketball
for coach Rick Barnes and the Longhorns.
Ford, who led Fort Bend Willowridge to a 36-1 season and the state Class 5A
Championship last year,  probably is the most heralded basketball recruit
in
Longhorn history. He is rated as one of the nation's top 25 players and is
one of the top two or three point guards.
He had offers from schools all over the nation, but wound up deciding
between
Texas, Louisville, Memphis State and Houston.
I saw Ford at the State Basketball Tournament last year. He is as quick as
any player I have seen. He can run faster dribbling the ball than anyone I
have seen at the high school level. He can dunk the ball easily, too. He
averaged 9.1 points, 9.3 assists, 5-1, rebounds and 4.8 steals for
Willowridge last season.
He is great at everything except shooting, and that won't bother Barnes,
who
likes point guards who are more interested in distributing the ball than in
their shooting opportunities. Distributing the ball is what Ford does as
well
as any point guard in the country.
He had a press conference Wednesday  to announce his decision to play
basketball for the Longhorns.
"I'm excited to have a chance to play for coach Barnes and the Longhorns,"
he
said. "I just felt like Texas was the best place for me. I have a great
relationship with coach Barnes and the other Texas coaches and I'm looking
forward to it."
But first, Ford said he hopes he can help Willowridge win another state
title. "We have four guys back who started last year," he said. The team
lost
6-8 center Ivan McFarlin, who signed with Oklahoma State, but Ford said the
Eagles have another good inside player to replace him.
The Longhorns have only two scholarships to award this year and Chris
Wright,
a  6-10 center at Redwater, committed last year.  So, unless some
underclassman leaves the team, Ford's commitment wraps up recruiting. Both
Ford and Wright plan to sign on Nov. 8, the first day of the early signing
period.
* * * *
The Longhorns finally got in a full-scale practice Wednesday after being
driven indoors by lightning Tuesday..
Coach Mack Brown said he and the other coaches have stressed to the team
this
week the importance of playing good games back to back.
"We've proved we can play well after a loss," he said. "We need to prove we
can play well after a win. We've been a team that never knows who's going
to
show up, and we need to start showing up every week."
Brown said he told the players they can beat everybody left on the schedule
or lose to everybody left on the schedule, depending on how hard they work
and how hard they play.
He said injuries are a problem, particularly at defensive tackle. "Casey
Hampton is the only one who is healthy," he said. "Shaun Rogers will play,
but his ankle is still sore. Ryan Haywood has a sore shoulder and Stevie
Lee
is still out with his foot injury."
He said he still hopes to redshirt Adam Doiron, but said, "We might have to
play him this week. We're really thin at defensive tackle. Doiron is a true
freshman from Duncan, Okla.
* * * *
The Longhorns are a 21-point favorite over Missouri.
* * * *
QB Chris Simms said Tuesday he might redshirt next season, but said he has
no
plans to transfer after losing the starting job to Major Applewhite. Simms
played last year as a true freshman and he could have two years left after
Applewhite graduates if he redshirts next season. If  he redshirts, current
freshman QB Chance Mock would back up Applewhite.
* * * *
FOOTBALL RECRUITING  NOTES: With 19 early commitments, the Longhorns
probably
will sign six to eight more prospects. They can take at least 26 players
because punter Brian Bradford of Trinity Valley JC will enroll in January
and
can be counted against last year's class total. . . TE James Moses and DE
Jonathan Jackson, the two Galena Park North Shore stars the Horns are
recruiting, say they plan to come to the Missouri game this weekend.

True Orange, Part 2

Recruiting Roundup

RB Cedric Benson of Midland Lee and OL Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter are =
UT
commitments who are on USA-Today's Top 25 national players.
Two other UT pledges =01) OL Abe Robinson of Jersey Village and QB-Athlete
Kendal Briles of Frenship =01) are on some national top 100 lists.
Benson, running behind an all-new offensive line, is still racking up
impressive numbers. He had 14 carries for 140 yards and a TD, plus a 38-yar=
d
reception, in the defending state champions' 40-12 victory over a good
Victoria team in the season opener, then scored four touchdowns on just nin=
e
carries, good for 142 yards, in a 40-7 romp past Longview.
His four TDs came on runs of 19, 4, 85 and 4 yards. For the year, he has 23=
,
carries, 282 yards and five touchdowns. Behind an inexperienced OL, he is
averaging 12.3 yards per carry and a touchdown every 4.6 carries.
Terrance Young, the huge Longview OL who also has committed to UT, said it
was a long way to go for a high school football game, but he said it was
worth it just to see Benson run.
"I heard he was the best running back in the nation and he is awesome," You=
ng
said. " Blocking for him is going to be a lot of fun. He is an awesome
player."
Benson won't have the monster year he had last year, at his present pace,
simply because he isn't carrying the ball as much.
Lee coach John Parchman, trying for a third consecutive state title, is
working on a more diversified attack to try to spread things out a little
more. When you lose as many seniors as he did, you have to improvise.
Briles, the Class 4A Offensive Player of the Year while leading Stephenvill=
e
to the state title in 1999, is at a new 4A school, Wolfforth Frenship near
Lubbock, because his dad, former Stephenville coach Art Briles, is on the
coaching staff at Texas Tech.
But don't worry about him requiring any time to get adjusted. Frenship open=
ed
its season Friday and Briles passed for 279 yards and four touchdowns and r=
an
for 105 more yards and two more tallies in a 47-20 conquest of Canyon, an
11-3 playoff team last year.
I went to Houston to scout some players last weekend. Galena Park North Sho=
re
beat Alief Hastings Friday night in Galena Park, where it actually rained.
It's been so dry in Austin lately that I enjoyed getting wet.
North Shore TE James Moses and DE/LB Jonathan Jackson both looked good, but=
 a
guy who really caught my eye was Hastings' DT Rodrique Wright, a junior who
is listed in the program as 6-5, 324. If he is No. 61, as the program state=
s,
he looks about 6-4, 270, but he is a fine player. He stuffs the run, and he
has great quickness to chase  the passer. Look for him to be a big-time
recruit next year.
Aldine played Madison in a battle of Class 5A Houston powers. Aldine won, b=
ut
the most impressive players in the game were Madison OL William Winston and
his team's junior QB, Vincent Young.
Winston has the quickest feet of any 330-pounder I've seen this year.
Aldine's Lawrence Hooper is a highly recruited DE. Some people think he's t=
he
best one in the state, but Winston definitely won their individual battle. =
At
6-6, 330, he is big enough to overpower most opponents, and he is incredibl=
y
quick at sliding out to pick up speed rushers. He is still considering Texa=
s,
A&M and a lot of other people, and he is a prize.
Young is 6-5, 190, and he runs a sub-4.5 40. He has a powerful arm, but
Aldine is a ground-oriented team and he is outstanding on the option. He wi=
ll
be one of the state's top 10 recruits next year.
Selvin Young, the great Jersey Village junior running back who topped the
2,200-yard rushing mark as a sophomore, is still bothered by the badly
sprained ankle he suffered at the end of last season, and he saw only limit=
ed
action in his team's opener.
* * * *
Eric Hall, the fine defensive end from Clarksville, Tenn., took his officia=
l
visit to Texas last weekend, and his mother said he had a great time.
He didn't get home in time for me to talk to him before going to press, but
he told me before he came that Texas was his No. 1 choice, and his mother
said he told her the visit went even better than he expected.
Other high school stars who came to the game Saturday included three of the
state's top 10 players =01) DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellis, OL Jami High=
tower
of Jacksonville and S Dewayne Brandon of Temple.
Harris said he had a great time at UT. "It was great seeing all those peopl=
e
in the stands," he said. "I can really see myself as a Longhorn. I couldn't
believe some of the plays Roy Williams made. They tell you that you can pla=
y
as a freshman if you're good enough, and he proved that's true."
But he said he wants to take some official visits before making committing =
to
anyone.
Brandon also said Texas is his top choice.
Hightower says it's a three-team race between Texas, A&M and Nebraska "and
nobody is out front. I want to take official visits to all three of them
before making up my mind."
Killeen Ellison MLB Yamil Lebron and San Antonio Holmes CB Cedric Griffin,
two other UT commitments, also were at the game.
* * * *
The Horns have 13 total commitments. They haven't added anyone since my
August issue.

he

Out-of-State Prospects

Texas is recruiting several out-of-state players. Here are the ones who are
seriously considering UT:
Quarterback
Bret Rawls, 6-5, 200, 4.7, Shreveport Evangel (LSU, UT, FSU, Tenn)
Running Back
Jabari Davis, 5-11, 224, 4.5, Tucker, Ga. (Tenn, Ga, UT, Neb, Ala)

UT)

Recruiting: Proof Is in the Pudding

I've been covering recruiting since 1990, and there definitely is a
correlation between recruiting success and success on the field.
But Dave Campbell's Texas Football Magazine has been around a lot longer th=
an
that, and subscriber Grant Erwin of Dallas went back to 1983, the year befo=
re
the Aggies finally started having success against Texas after decades of
being hammered, and compiled the results.
The magazine ranks recruiting classes in June of the following year, so it =
is
able to study every other ranking in detail before coming up with its own
list of top recruits. That should give it a great degree of accuracy.
Here is what the study showed:

DCTF Recruiting Rankings in the Southwest Conference, plus results of UT-A&=
M
game:
**83: A&M #1, Texas #3  UT won, 45-13
**84: A&M #1, Texas #4  A&M won, 37-12
**85: A&M #2, Texas #3  A&M won, 42-10
**86: A&M #1, Texas #5  A&M won, 16-3
**87: A&M #1, Texas #4  A&M won, 20-13

89: Texas #1, A&M #2        A&M won, 21-10

**99: Texas #1, A&M #2  A&M won, 20-16
**00: Texas #1, A&M #2
** Indicates recruiting battle won by a wide margin, according to Dave
Campbell's rating system.

A&M put together several outstanding classes in a row in the early 1980's,
and kept it going, with the exception of 1989, until Texas started having
good recruiting success again in 1993.
It's no coincidence that the Aggies, who had never  won more than three in =
a=20
row against the Longhorns (and that was way back in 1909-10-11), won five i=
n
a row and nine times in 10 years during their recruiting dominance over the
Longhorns.
Team with superior talent rarely lose to less talented teams, and that is w=
hy
the Aggies enjoyed their decade in the sun.
But look at those recent classes. All the strange happenings at A&M last
season delayed the inevitable, in my opinion, and, if those recruiting
rankings continue to prove as accurate a crystal ball as they have in the
last two decades, the Longhorns' supremacy in recruiting should make this
first decade of the new century a great one for UT in this long series, whi=
ch
the Horns already lead, 67-34-5.

Four Baseball Stars Commit

The Longhorn  baseball coaches already have commitments from four top
baseball players.
They are catcher Jack Sweeney, 6-2, 200, of powerhouse Houston Bellaire and
three hard-throwing right-handed pitchers =01)  Joey Guajardo, 6-0, 190, wh=
o
threw three no-hitters as a junior at Round Rock, and  Austin Westlake aces
Chaz Taylor, 6-3, 180, and, Huston Street, 5-11, 180.
Street, who was 6-1 with a 1.27 ERA last season,  is the son of former UT
football and baseball star James Street.
Taylor pitched a two-hitter this summer against the Dallas Mustangs, a
powerful team that included seven college players or signees, including Jas=
on
Stokes of Coppell. He struck Stokes out twice in that game. Stokes, a UT
signee, signed a $2 million pro contract last week.
Sweeney started 10 games as a freshman at Bellaire and has been a starter
ever since. He is the best defensive catcher in the country and also wields=
 a
powerful bat.

Basketball Recruiting

The weekend of the first Longhorn football game also was a huge recruiting
weekend for both Texas basketball teams.
T. J. Ford, the 5-11 point guard who led Fort Bend Willowridge to the Class
5A State Championship last season, took his official visit to UT.
He said he enjoyed the trip. "I really like the coaches and the players and
there are a lot of things to do at UT and in Austin," he said.
He said he plans to visit Cincinnati and possibly Louisville and Houston
before making a decision.
Ford is one of the top three point guards in the country.
The Longhorn women had two top recruits in town for official visits. They a=
re
6-2 forward Jody Bell of Chestermere HS in Calgary, Canada, and 5-11 guard
Lauren Selmon of Norman, Okla. Selmon is the daughter of former OU and pro
football star Dewey Selmon.

Football Videos Available

Host Communications is offering its season video package against this year.
You can get a video each week with the complete UT football game on it, plu=
s
some of coach Mack Brown's pre-game, half-time and post-game comments to th=
e
team and media, and the Longhorn radio team's play-by-play when you sign up=
.
It's $250 for the 11-game package, and, if UT makes the Big 12 championship
game, that one is included, too.
To order the package, you can call 512-478-1833 and ask for Extension 10.
I get this package and it's a great way to watch each game because all the
huddles and the time between plays are eliminated. I can watch the entire
game, with coach Brown's comments, in less than an hour.

UT Women Set Schedule

The Longhorn women's basketball schedule features 27 regular season games,
highlighted by UT's hosting of the elite Four in the Fall doubleheader
basketball tournament (Saturday, Dec. 9) which will  be televised nationall=

High School Sub Notice

Big 12 Conference is directing all member universities to notify publishers

continue to publicly urge you to buy library subscriptions.
I'm not sure the conference could make that stick if anybody wanted to put =
it
to the legal test, but she told me all the other school publications in the

Pittman Fund Drive Lagging

Longhorns need to get busy or the plans at Shreveport Evangel to build the
Cole Pittman Memorial Field House are going down the drain.
Every UT fan I have talked to thinks the Longhorn football player was an
outstanding young man from an outstanding family and sincerely mourns his
passing.
If you feel that way and want to help preserve his memory and, while you are
at, help UT's image a lot at Shreveport Evangel, please mail a contribution,
large or small, today to the Cole Pittman Memorial Fund, 22023-1 Mossy Oaks,
Spring, Texas 77389.
If you can afford a big contribution, that's great. It's going to take some
big ones to get it done.
If you can't, how about sending $44? Cole's number at Texas was 44 and it
takes big ones and little ones to make this happen.
When a young man or woman dies, we all mourn for a while and then move on.
But the Pittman family can't ever truly move on. Parents who have to bury
their children are always haunted by it.
It won't make their pain go away if Longhorns are instrumental in seeing
those field house plans come true, but I guarantee you it will help ease it
because the Pittmans will know that UT people cared enough to help keep Cole
Pittman's memory alive.

Game Quotes . .

"Texas has a very good football team. They have great  speed on defense. They
have the great lateral movement and we tried to run at them and they did a
good job there as well. We had bad field position all night, but their
defense had something to do with that. They do a great job with the special
teams. They did a good job getting down the field and making the play."
- New Mexico State head coach Tony Samuel
* * * *
"We  started off slow, but they had played a game and we hadn't. It took a
while for us to get going and we have a lot of things to work on. I was
pleased with the way we ran the ball in the second half. They threw some
blitzes at us that they hadn't used before, so we made a conscious decision
to go with more three-step (drops instead of the normal 5-step drops). If
they are coming after us, we know they have to play man for man. We also
decided to force the run, even if they had nine in the box. We want to be
able to run it when we want to, regardless of the defensive lineup."
- UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis
* * * *
"We came out and played hard and really got with it in the first half. We
made some mistakes in the third quarter, but those are things we can go back
and coach next week. We thought we would see more option, but we ran them
down early and they got away from it."
- Texas defensive coordinator Carl Reese
* * * *
"They played hard and threw a lot of different things against us. I talked to
Montrell (Flowers) after that second touchdown and he goes, 'Man, I got two
touchdown passes tonight and I only got two all of last year.' He did a great
job for us tonight."
- UT QB Chris Simms
* * * *
"I'm happy on my overall performance tonight, but I am even more happy that
the team has gotten the season off to a good start with a win. The passes
were perfect all night. They just came right to me. I have to give all of the
credit to Chris Simms. He was on target the whole time, which made my job
easier. All I had to do is catch it and run."
- Longhorn senior WR Montrell Flowers
* * * *
"Oh, it felt good. It was fun. I enjoyed it. With the guys we have up front,
it's fun to run the ball. It was great scoring my first college touchdown. It
probably won't hit me until I get out of this room. I had so much excitement
and energy running through me tonight. I really enjoyed this game. I loved
carrying the ball, the crowd and everything about tonight.  I was not really
nervous. I had three quarters to sit down and relax, so I think that helped
me out by not going in too early."
- Texas true freshman RB Cedric Benson

Scouting North Carolina

Longhorn coach Mack Brown had great success at North Carolina before coming
to Texas following an 11-1 season with the Tar Heels in 1997.
Carolina's football fortunes have waned since Brown's departure, but nothing
would make the Tar Heels happier than putting a licking on their former coach
when they come to Austin Saturday for an 11 a.m. game.
At 0-2, with a 41-27 loss at Oklahoma and a 23-7 league defeat at the hands
of Maryland already in the books, Carolina is a 22-point underdog.
The Tar Heels have an outstanding defensive front four, headed by Julius
Peppers, a 6-6, 290-pound end who Brown said "might be the nation's top
defensive player."
Ironically, he recruited Peppers for the Tar Heels before leaving for Texas.
Joey Evans, 6-4, 264, is the other defensive end, and he also is being eyed
by NFL scouts.
But so far this season, the Tar Heel defense hasn't had a chance because the
offense has committed eight turnovers in the two losses.
TB Willie Parker, a swift 200-pounder, had a 77-yard touchdown run against
Maryland.
At QB, Ronald Curry is quick and elusive, but is getting a battle from
freshman Darian Durant, a redshirt freshman who has relieved Curry in both
early season losses.
Durant has completed 22 of 40 passes for 249 yards and two touchdowns, with
two interceptions. He has a QB efficiency rating of 113.79.
Curry has completed 11 of 25 passes for 135 yards with no touchdowns and two
interceptions. He has a QB efficiency rating of 70.54.
I expect Durant, a 5-11, 225-pounder with good speed and a strong arm, to be
the quarterback at Texas unless Curry gets off to a really quick start.
Brown said the eight turnovers have killed North Carolina in the two losses.
"They will quit turning the ball over at some point, and then they will be
hard to handle," he said.
Let's hope they keep on turning it over Saturday.
The Longhorns need to come out ready to play because the Tar Heels certainly
will.
This game has been dedicated to the memory of Cole Pittman, the young
Longhorn defensive tackle who was tragically killed in an automobile accident
in February.

Late, Great Rally Comes Up Short at Stanford;
Texas Falls From No. 5 to No. 15 After Loss

The Longhorns couldn't run, couldn't protect the quarterback, got a punt
blocked for a Stanford touchdown, and still almost won the game against the
defending Pac 10 champion Cardinals.
But they didn't. Stanford won a 27-24 verdict with a late touchdown that
negated a 15-point fourth-quarter Texas rally.
Coach Mack Brown praised the Longhorns' fight, and they did fight, and he
said the team can build on the loss because it showed the young players the=
y
have a chance to win tough games on the road.
"We tried," he said. "This one was tough because of the mistakes we made. W=
e
came back and had a chance to win it with those two big fourth quarter
drives. We just came up a little short."
Brown said the team has to work hard to improve. He didn't single out the
offensive line as a unit that needs to improve, but, while the receivers
dropped some ball, the quarterbacks missed some open receivers and the
defense bent more than it should, the one constant negative this year has
been an inability to run the football.
After playing two teams who are not very good at stopping the run, the
Longhorns are last in the Big 12 and No. 112 of 114 Division I football tea=
ms
in average rushing yardage per game at 50. In two games, they have 100 net
rushing yards.
The Longhorns actually ran the ball better against Stanford than they did
against a weak Louisiana-Lafayette team in their opening 52-10 win, but the
Cardinal defenders had five sacks to cut into the net figure.
I have been predicting a very good season, and Brown has been saying the te=
am
has some problems and must get better to accomplish its goals. He's right a=
nd
I'm wrong. Let's just hope he and his assistant coaches can work out the
problems in the offense in time to let the team accomplish its goals.
The victory gave Stanford, a 14-point underdog, a 2-1 record, while the
Longhorns fell to 1-1.
Here, briefly, is how the game went:
FIRST QUARTER
Stanford won the toss and took the ball. After an exchange of punts, Stanfo=
rd
drove to midfield, but backup DE Maurice Gordon sacked QB Randy Fasani and
Fasani suffered an injured ankle and had to leave the game. He was replaced
by sophomore Chris Lewis. A face-mask penalty on a bad Stanford punt negate=
d
that punt and gave Stanford a first down at the 47 and the Cardinal took
advantage of that Longhorn miscue, scoring in four plays with Lewis hitting
WR Luke Powell behind Quentin Jammer for the final 37 yards to put Stanford
ahead, 6-0, with 6:06 left in the quarter. DE Cory Redding blocked the extr=
a
point. Ivan Williams ran the kickoff back to the 22. Texas drove to the
Stanford 43 before stalling. Kris Stockton got off a great punt that kicked
out of bounds at the Stanford 2. A fumbled snap pushed Stanford inside the =
2,
then Redding and DT Casey Hampton led a surge that trapped FB Casey Moore i=
n
the end zone for a safety with 1:14 left, leaving Stanford on top, 6-2. Chr=
is
Simms came in at QB for Texas and the Horns were at midfield as the period
ended.
SECOND QUARTER
Simms hit freshman WR Roy Williams down the middle for a 37-yard touchdown
strike on the third play of the quarter. Williams broke an attempted tackle
by CB Ryan Fernandez at the 21 and strolled in for the score. Stockton's ki=
ck
put Texas on top, 9-6, with 13:59 left. Applewhite relieved Simms midway
through the period. Neither team threatened again until Stanford drove 67
yards, primarily on two big pass plays, to take a 13-9 left with 4:49 left.
Neither team threatened again before intermission.
THIRD QUARTER
Texas got the ball first, but failed to make a first down and had to punt. =
A
horde of Stanford defenders poured through and blocked it and backup FB Emo=
ry
Brock covered it in the end zone for a touchdown, putting Stanford up, 20-9=
,
just one minute deep into the second half. The rest of the quarter was a
defensive struggle, with each team making only one first down.
FOURTH QUARTER
Applewhite hit WR Montrell Flowers for 19 yards on the second play of the
fourth quarter to revive the long dormant UT offense and get the Horns
started on a drive that enabled them to get into Stanford territory for the
first time in the second half, but a holding penalty and then a sack pushed
the Horns back and killed the drive. With 9:39 left and Longhorn fans
everywhere beginning to despair, Texas, starting from its own 29, got back =
in
the game on one huge play. Applewhite found freshman WR B. J. Johnson behin=
d
all the defenders and hit him for a 71-yard scoring strike. The Horns decid=
ed
to go for a 2-point conversion and, after a pass interference penaty put th=
e
ball on the 1, Mitchell went over the top to get the two-pointer and cut th=
e
Stanford lead to 20-17 with 9:29 left. The Texas defense, again forced
Stanford to punt quickly. Mitchell returned the punt to the Texas 41.
Applewhite hit TE Mike Jones for 25 yards to the Stanford 34, but, under a
big blitz, he was intercepted at the Stanford 4 with 7:46 left. Stanford
punted with 6:42 left, and Mitchell made a great punt return, dashing 48
yards to the Cardinal 18, but a holding penalty on the return pushed the
Horns back to the 38. Backup TB Victor Ike was stopped for no gain and
Applewhite threw an incomplete pass and to bring up third-and-10. Ike raced
down the left sideline and caught Applewhite's long throw just behind a
Stanford defender and sprinted in for the TD, putting Texas ahead, 24-20,
with 5:44 left. Stanford got a good kickoff return to the Cardinal 46, but
couldn't move and had to punt, giving Texas a chance to run the clock out
with 5:44 left. A couple of first downs would have done it, but two
false-start penalties left the Horns in a hole. They made 19 yards in three
plays, but faced a fourth-and-1 at their own 29 and had to punt. Stanford,
held in check throughout the second half by the Longhorn defense, started i=
ts
drive with 1:55 left. The Cardinal scored in five plays, with Lewis hitting
WR DeRonnie Phipps for 30 yards to the Texas 29. The Longhorns were called
for roughing the passer and a penalty to the 15 was tacked on. After an
incompletion, Lewis found Pitts again and he barreled over for the winning =
TD
with 1:12 left. Texas had enough time to come back, but the Stanford defens=
e,
which already had three sacks, got two more in that final minute to finish
off the Longhorns.
Notes . .
* The Longhorns haven't rushed for 100 net yards in their last five games.
They are 1-4 in those games, with the lone victory being the season opener
against Louisiana-Lafayette.
* The Texas' defense allowed Stanford only one first down in the third
quarter and only two in the fourth quarter, until the Cardinal's winning
drive in the final two minutes.
* Texas had 18 possessions. Three of them resulted in touchdown, two ended
with pass interceptions, 12 ended with punts and the one at the end of the
game ended on downs after Applewhite was sacked twice.
* Texas' three touchdown plays accounted for 149 of the Longhorns 343 total
net yards. It was a feast-or-famine kind of game for the UT offense, which
only three other plays that gained more than 12 yards.

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown was tired Sunday afternoon for his weekly post-game news
conference. The team plane left Palo Alto at 3 a.m. Texas time and got back
to Austin around 7 a.m.
But he was fairly upbeat. "You always hate to lose," he said, "but if you
have to lose, you ought to lose early. If you're going to lose, it ought to
be out of conference."
He said the only thing the lose really costs the Longhorns is a chance at
going undefeated, "and we're not a national championship caliber team, in m=
y
opinion."
He said the Horns can still accomplish a lot. "Look at Stanford last year,"
he said. "You never want to lose a game, but Stanford wins the Pac 10 last
year after they leave here with an embarrassing loss."
Brown said nothing went the Longhorns' way in Palo Alto. "It was a night th=
at
nothing worked for us, but the positive thing is that we still had a chance
to win."
No one asked him about his starting quarterback because he says he has two
starters, but it appears Major Applewhite is back in the saddle. He started
Saturday night and was the quarterback on 14 of UT's 18 possessions.
Sophomore Phil Simms got the other four possessions.
He can't comment on officiating without getting in trouble with the Big 12
office, but there were a lot of penalties against the Longhorns that came a=
t
crucial times, like the flagrant face-mask call that negated Stanford's pun=
t
on a fourth-and-25 and gave the Cardinal an automatic first down en route t=
o
their first touchdown. The Longhorns also had two false start penalties whe=
n
they were trying to run out the clock with a 24-20 lead. They gained 19 yar=
ds
on their three plays that stood up, but that left a yard short and they had
to run.Then there was a roughing-the-passer penalty on Stanford's winning
drive in the final two minutes.
While Brown couldn't comment after the game, he had several animated
discussions with the officials during the action.
Without commenting on the officiating, he said, "They got a holding call on
an incomplete pass on third down on one touchdown. The face mask penalty le=
d
to a score. There was a late hit call on the quarterback on their last
(scoring) drive. Those things just abolutely kill because just about every
one led to points for them."
Brown said the Longhorns didn't use their shotgun formation with four
wideouts more because "we weren't throwing the ball and catching it very
well. That's something we would have done more if we had done better at it.=
"
"We didn't have a good night throwing the ball overall," he said. "We had
some drops, we had some passes that missed and we had some young receivers
who were playing on the road for the first time. Montrell Flowers was the g=
uy
who played the best among the wide receivers, and he's the most experienced=
.
It was a combination of errors on our passing game. We were just not smooth=
."
Brown was asked about the team's performance in specific area that have
caused problems in the past and have gotten special attention, like the
offensive line and the special teams.
He said, "After looking at the tape, the offensive line played better than =
we
thought. The blitzes were our big problem. It looked worse than it was. I
feel like we've made some progress with our offensive line. We've got to ke=
ep
working on that. I think the special teams have improved a lot. We had some
kickoff returns and Hodges (Mitchell) had the good punt return, but we had =
a
blocked punt for a touchdown. We had to punt a lot, but that blocked punt
really bothers me. We can't have one, no matter how many times we have to
punt. That's the part they have to focus on."
He said Texas has to bounce back quickly from the long, tiring road trip,
coupled with the loss.
"Our guys are totally exhausted. We got back at 7 a.m. (Sunday). That's why
we didn't go to Hawaii =01) because we knew it would be a hard game and a l=
ong
trip."
"Our team played really hard. This was tough because we played so hard, but
had too many mistakes. But our kids fought all the way. That's what we have
to build on. We've got another game Saturday."
"Houston is not going to care about our loss," he said. "It'll probably
excite them. We can sit around and mope or we can get ready to play again.
This was a little eye opener for us to get better and move forward."
He said players and coaches can't get as up or down as fans because they kn=
ow
they have to get ready to play another game and can't dwell on a win or a
loss until the season is over.
"That's the least of my worries," he said. "They really tried. When you
really try and you can come back on the road and have a chance to win, that=
's
something that's a positive to build on."
He said this game will help the team later on because it was a game the Hor=
ns
could have won on the road against a good team.
"We just made too many mistakes," he said. "That's something we can correct=
.
If we had a team that didn't care, that it didn't both to lose, that's the
worst thing that can happen to you as a coach, but that's not the problem."
After the game Saturday night, Brown said most of the players were so upset
they were crying.
"We can build on this," he said. "We have a really young football team. We'=
ll
come back and get better. We can correct the mistakes."
"We took a big step in these big games by just hanging in there and hanging
in there. As long as they'll fight, you can coach them, and they fought all
the way. It was mistakes that cost them, not their effort, and that can be
fixed. We made three or four mistakes that probably cost us the game."
Brown said the bottom line is "we're a young team and we will get better."
INJURY UPDATE: Brown said safety Lee Jackson has a strained hamstring and
linebacker Marcus Wilkins has a sore groin. He said those appeared to be th=
e
only injuries sustained in the Stanford game and both players are expected =
to
be back at practice by the middle of the week.

Part 2

Scouting Baylor

Texas hosts Baylor at 11:30 a.m. Saturday in a game that will be televised =
by
the Fox Network.
The Bears (25) have really struggled this season. Their only victories are
over North Texas State, 20-7, and South Florida, 28-13.
They have been shut out in their last three games, falling to Texas Tech,
28-0; A&M, 24-0, and Nebraska, 59-0. Their other losses were to Minnesota,
34-9, and Iowa State, 31-17.
The Bears had counted on former UT QB Greg Cicero to give them a good passi=
ng
attack, but he went down with a season-ending injury and they have had one =
of
the least productive offenses in the country.
There are 114 teams playing Division I football and Baylor ranks 104th in
rushing, 94th in passing, 111th in total offense and 110th in scoring.
The Baylor defense is a little better, but not much.
The Longhorns should be able to name their score in this one, even if they =
do
show up a little flat.
Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):
Texas                                       Baylor
Offense
(88)   110.3         Rushing Avg.        (104)   85.3
(12)   290.9         Passing Avg.          (94) 159.1
(35)   401.2        Total Off. Avg.      (111) 244.4    (10)
36.3                Scoring Avg      (110)   10.6

Defense

(19)   181.0         Passing Avg.          (48) 202.3
(14)   288.7        Total Def. Avg.      (102) 426.2
(29)     19.0    Opp. Scoring Avg          (78)   28.0

UT's Bowl Outlook

The Longhorns have to win their four remaining regular season games to have=
 a
chance to defend their Big 12 Southern Division title, and, unless Oklahoma
loses twice, starting Saturday against Nebraska, that wouldn't get them int=
o
the league title game.
But a 9-2 regular would guarantee them a good bowl game.
The Big 12 champion is guaranteed a spot in one of the big four BCS bowls,
and the runnerup could wind up in one of the BCS bowls, too.
The Cotton Bowl gets the second pick, the Holiday Bowl in San Diego gets
third choice and the Alamo Bowl gets the fourth pick.
By winning out, Texas would be likely to wind up in either the Holiday Bowl
or the Alamo Bowl.
If the Big 12 lands two teams in the BCS bowls, a 9-2 Texas probably would
wind up in San Diego.
If only one Big 12 lands in the BCS bowls, San Antonio is a more likely
stopping spot for the bowl season.
If the Horns don't go 9-2, they still will qualify for a bowl by beating
Baylor Saturday and they will will go bowling somewhere.

Big 12 Roundup
The big game this week is in Norman where top-ranked and unbeaten Nebraska
takes on undefeated and third-ranked Oklahoma.
Kansas State travels to Texas A&M in another big game that will trim the li=
st
of contenders for the two division titles to four.
The Wildcats and Aggies already have one loss in conference plays and a
second would be fatal to their title hopes.

Recruiting Roundup

The Longhorns actually went through an entire week without getting a
commitment, so they are still at 19, with a few slots left to fill.
One player who would fit one of those remaining spots very nicely =01) safe=
ty
Dewayne Brandon of Temple =01) was one of the recruits who came to the
Texas-Missouri game Saturday.
The only other top recruits at the game were three who already are committe=
d
to Texas =01) CB Aaron Ross of Tyler John Tyler, WR/DB Brian Carter of the =
The
Woodlands and DB/LB Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity.
Ross and his Tyler Lions are having a fine season. They are 5-1 overall and
2-0 in their district. Ross is playing running back and wide receiver, in
addition to the defensive backfield.
He has scored one touchdown as a receiver and three as a running back.
He said only five passes have been thrown his way all year. "I intercepted
one of them, one was completed and I knocked the other three down," he said=
.
The Longhorns will give five to seven more scholarships, and most of them
will be filled from a group of nine players.
They are Brandon, LB Derrick Johnson of Waco, DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia,
Cal., and DE Jonathan Jackson and TE James Moses, both of Galena Park North
Shore; DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison, Athlete Joseph Addai of Houston
Sharpstown and OLs William Winston of Houston Madison and Jami Hightower of
Jacksonville.
Super DT Paul Broussard of Blinn JC is another possibility, but he has some
academic hurdles to clear.
The Longhorns are in good shape with Brandon, Johnson, Jakes, Jackson and
Moses.
They have as good a chance as anyone with Harris, but the trouble there is
that the Killeen Ellison star has a lengthy list of schools he is
considering, and he recently added Oklahoma to the mix and says he is wide
open.
FB James Buchanon of Cardinal Mooney HS in Sarasota, Fla., is still
considering Texas, but he is a long shot.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: Galena Park North Shore is 7-0 and Jackson and Moses are
having great years. Moses doesn't get a lot of passes thrown his way, but h=
e
has very good hands, good speed and he is a tremendous blocker. Jackson, wh=
o
switched from linebacker to defensive end this year, is an outstanding pass=
 ru
sher, due to his 4.56 40 speed and big frame. Jackson's early college
favorites give a strong indication he'll be playing in Texas or Florida. Hi=
s
top five are Texas, A&M, FSU, Miami and Florida, but I'll be surprised if
both these blue-chippers don't join former teammate Cory Redding at Texas .=
 .
. Midland Lee star Cedric Benson isn't getting as many carries as he did la=
st
season and he's running behind an all new and undersized line, but he's sti=
ll
lethal when he gets a chance. He hit Abilene Cooper for 335 yards and five
touchdowns on 36 carries Friday night in Midland in a key District 4-5A gam=
e.
He's a Longhorn commitment and he's on everybody's national top 100 list. H=
e
won't have the great statistics he had on last year's 15-0 state title team=
,
but he looks even bigger and faster this year.

Top Girls Basketball Stars Visit

Coach Jody Conradt has already corraled a great recruiting class for her
Longhorn women's basketball team, but things could get even better because
she got visits last weekend from the nation's top junior and one of the
state's top three seniors.
The top junior is 6-2 guard/forward Ann Strother of Highlands Ranch,
Colorado, and the top three Texas star is Niki Newton, a 6-1 forward from
Crowley.
Strother is visiting several schools unofficially this year to decide which
schools she wants to seriously consider next year.
Contadt already has commitments from two national top 50 players =01)  6-2
Heather Schreiber of Windthorst and 6-2 Kala Bowers of Woodward, Okla. They
are the top prospects in their respective states.
Schreiber is rated as the nation's No. 26 prospect and Bowers is ranked No.
41 by the All Star Girls Report, a national rating service.

Horns Back in AP Rankings

The Longhorns regained the top 25 in the Associated Press rankings this wee=
k,
coming in at No. 22. They are No. 20 in the coaches' poll.
That hasn't always been good news in recent years. It seems like every time
the Horns get a good ranking, they get beat.
Is it complacency or overconfidence or just the fact they lose to a better
team? I'm not sure, but I do know that's why they haven't finished in the t=
op
10 since 1983. They've been in the top 10 several times, but they haven't
been able to stay there.

Kick Returns Picking Up

Coach Mack Brown's announced goal of improving the kick return teams this
season is paying big dividends.
Victor Ike is No. 2 in the country in kickoff returns, averaging 30.5 yards
on 11 returns, and Hodges Mitchell is No. 25 nationally in punt returns,
averaging 12.3 yards on 25 tries.

Unbeaten List Shrinking

Only five Division 1 teams still have perfect records and the list will
shrink by at least one this weekend when No. 1 Nebraska (7-0) and No. 3
Oklahoma (6-0) meet.
The other teams with perfect records are No. 2 Virginia Tech (7-0), No. 5
Clemson (8-0) and No. 11 Texas Christian (6-0).

4 True Freshmen Will Start

Tight end Brock Edwards will start against Baylor Saturday, giving the
Longhorns four true freshmen in the starting lineup.
Edwards joins defensive end Kalen Thornton, who has started the last four
games and wide receivers Roy Williams and B. J. Johnson, who have started t=
he
last two games.
Edwards was pressed into the starting lineup when Mike Jones, the team's
starting tight end, suffered a lick on his knee early in the Missouri game.
Coach Mack Brown said Edwards "did a good job" against Missouri.
Two other redshirt freshmen have been starting. Marcus Tubbs has been worki=
ng
as the starter at defensive tackle while Shaun Rogers works his way back fr=
om
an ankle sprain, and Dakarai Pearson has won the starting free safety
position.
Rogers is getting better each week and might reclaim his starting job this
week.
Barring any late changes, the Longhorns will start two seniors (TB Hodges
Mitchell and OT Leonard Davis), four juniors (QB Major Applewhite, LT Mike
Williams, RG Antwan Kirk-Hughes and C Matt Anderson), two sophomores (LG
Derrick Dockery and FB Matt Trissel) and the three true freshmen (Williams,
Johnson and Edwards) on offense Saturday.
Defensively, they will start three seniors (tackles Rogers and Casey Hampto=
n
and SS Greg Brown), four juniors (LBs Everick Rawls, D. D. Lewis and Everic=
k
Rawls and CB Quentin Jammer), two sophomores (DE Cory Redding and CB Roderi=
ck
Babers), one redshirt freshman (Pearson) and one true freshman (Thornton).
Baseball Stars Commit to UT

The Longhorn baseball team got commitments from two more top recruits last
week, including a right-handed pitcher who has been clocked as high as 96 m=
ph
with his fast ball.
The pitcher is Kole Strayhorn, 6-1, 185, of Shawnee, Oklahoma, who had offe=
rs
from many schools, but who picked Texas over Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Cal
State-Fullerton and Baylor.
He was 8-1 last year with a 0.97 ERA. He struck out  99 in 60 innings and
said he gave up about 15 walks and about 25 hits.
He has been clocked as high as 96 mph, and he is consistent around 90. He
plays shortstop when he isn't pitching.
The only problem with Strayhorn is that pitchers who can hit 96 mph and who
have good control frequently wind up getting drafted so high that they get =
a
lot of money to go pro immediately.
The other recruit is shortstop Seth Johnston, 6-3, 190, of Boerne. He also =
is
the quarterback for Boerne's football team.
Johnson hit .507 last season and picked the Longhorns over Texas A&M and
Houston.

Simpler Is Better

Coach Mack Brown says he thinks the Horns will fare better now that the
coaches have simplified the offense.
Brown said he also thinks the two-back offense is better for Texas for
several reasons. He said having two backs behind the quarterback improves t=
he
pass protection.
When teams rush eight defenders, he  said the five linemen, the tight end a=
nd
one running back are outnumbered. When two backs are there, he said there a=
re
enough people to block everyone, even in a maximum blitz.
It also is a better power-running formation because of the extra blocker, h=
e
said, adding that success in the running game causes the other team's
safeties to creep up to help stop the run, which helps the passing game.
"When you can run and pass, it creates some problems for the defense," he
said. "We plan to keep working on being able to do both."
True freshman WR B. J. Johnson went along with the simplification idea, whi=
le
having some fun with the rerporters on hand. Johnson said when he first got
to Texas and "heard the coaches talking about cover 6 . . . I didn't even
know they had six coverages.
When someone asked him if he knew all the defensive coverages now, he said,
"I don't even know all the plays, to tell you to truth. You should see our
playbook."

Tommie Harris, DL, 6-3, 275, 4.75, Killeen Ellison, Texas

"I really go after it. I'm aggressive and I'm really strong," said Harris,
who bench presses 405 pounds. "I'm just blessed. That's all I can really
say." College coaches agree. Said one recruiting coordinator, "When you are
thinking about the best defensive linemen in the state of Texas, just draw
a
line under Tommie Harris. He is clearly the best defensive lineman in the
state. He is the only great one."

Last season, this 57-foot shot-putter had 139 tackles, including 21 for
losses and eight sacks. Tommie, whose father is in the Army, was born in
Germany but has lived in the United States since 1991.

He strongly favors TEXAS, which is 45 minutes from his home. "Mack Brown is
gonna do some good there. They are a team on the rise. I feel at home there
and there is no school with better facilities. They have a great weight
program. There is a 75 percent chance I'll choose TEXAS."

Others in the running are MIAMI ("I like their attack defense. I always
liked Warren Sapp. He's great. I don't know much about them, but my family
is from Pompano Beach and I still have family there."), TEXAS A&M, FLORIDA
STATE ("When I was a kid, I always used to watch them. Bobby Bowden looks
like he knows what he is doing.") and LSU.

Good as golden
Chris Simms has the name, the arm strength and the confidence. So is he
ready to inherit the Horns offense?


By Paul J. Weber
Daily Texan Staff

When Chris Simms reported to Texas' preseason camp earlier this month, he
did so bearing an enormous chip on his shoulder.

And it had nothing to do with the way the Longhorns' quarterback situation
was being handled.

"I hate putting on shoulder pads. I just hate it. I want the smallest
shoulder pads ever," Simms said. "Really, I wish I could just put my
kneepads on my shoulder. It makes me feel restricted, especially after
throwing without pads all summer. But I eventually got used to it."

His adjustment must of happened during the first afternoon practice of
two-a-days. Because for the past two weeks that Simms has engineered the
Horns' first-team offense at Whitaker Fields, there has scarcely been a
moment where the Texas sophomore hasn't looked comfortable operating behind
center. Sure, interceptions have been thrown and routes have been mistimed,
but Simms' trademark confidence has remained constant.

All the while, Simms has spent a lot of time in the middle of a day-to-day
frenzy at Texas, where a starting quarterback has yet to be named for the
season opener just 10 days away. Texas head coach Mack Brown has shyed away
from giving any indication as to who the starter might be or when the
selection will be announced, leaving just speculation as to whether it will
be Simms or Major Appplewhite who comes out on the field first Sept. 9
against Louisiana-Lafayette.

"We're doing what all you guys are doing," Brown said. "[Offensive
coordinator] Greg [Davis] and I are looking at, evaluating it, and trying
to
be fair. But honestly, I think both of these guys could play in the NFL."

That may be looking a bit too far ahead, but for the quarterback with the
regal NFL bloodlines, Simms has been taking the situation in stride.

He's brushed off the endless questions about the issue with ease, and in
the
meantime, has put together a string of practices that revealed a much more
patient and mature quarterback than the one abruptly thrust into
high-pressure situations toward the end of last season.

"All of this hubub hasn't been much of a distraction. I don't read the
news,
I don't read the newspaper," Simms said. "All I really watch is
SportsCenter
in my life. That's all I ever watch. That's all my life is. Practice, eat,
nap. Practice, eat, nap."

Simms finished his freshman campaign as the Horns' quarterback, after
Applewhite blew out his knee in the Cotton Bowl during Texas' 27-6 loss to
close out 1999. Surgery and rehabilitation kept the reigning co-Big 12
Offensive Player of the Year sidelined through spring drills, where Simms
assumed the starting quarterback position and showed every reason why he
was
one of the nation's top recruits when he came out of high school the year
before.

"He's got sharp instincts and a tremendous arm," Texas offensive
coordinator
Greg Davis said. "A guy like Chris gives you a lot of options in your
quarterback, between his mental understanding of the game and his physical
ability."

Simms reported to campus this fall about 17 pounds heavier than he was at
this time a year ago, as the 6-foot 5-inch signal caller added muscle in
the
weight room this offseason. He joked the biggest difference in his added
strength was "looking better in my uniform," but Simms does think the extra
muscle has given him better arm strength and has increased his ability to
take a hit, even though Brown has not allowed his quarterbacks to be
touched
this preseason.

"People ask me if I'm scared when I'm out there, and if I'm scared of
getting hit by these big guys while I'm out there. And yeah, I am scared,"
Simms said. "Because I don't want to fail. I don't want to be a failure. "

If Simms does start this season, his fear of failure should be eased by the
targets he'll be throwing to downfield. Texas has added a bumper crop of
wide receivers dubbed The Big Three to their offensive mix, with Roy
Williams, Sloan Thomas and B.J. Johnson poised to become big targets for
the
Texas passing attack this year.

And unlike Applewhite one of the more stationary quarterbacks in the pocket
Simms can be mobile when need be, though he doesn't really consider himself
a scrambler. Or at least one like Virginia Tech's Michael Vick, who like
Simms, is a lefty.

"I don't think I could ever do what he could do," Simms said. "I might be
able to run a 4.25 forty off a cliff, but that's about it."

And does Simms have an ideal situation for his playing time this season?

"Do I have an ideal situation? I think you can figure it out," Simms said.
"Just write it down, and you'll figure it out. "

Brown Says Injuries Piling Up, UT-Tech on Fox TV at 6 p.m.

The Longhorns are a 41-point favorite over Baylor in their 11:30 a.m.
Saturday game in Austin. It will be televised by Fox Syndication.
Coach Mack Brown said the Longhorns' injuries are piling up at certain
positions and he said some players will be cross-trained to improve the
depth
at those positions.
Sophomore TE Bo Scaife, the projected starter, suffered a season-ending
knee
injury during pre-season practice, and junior TE Mike Jones took a lick on
the knee against Missouri that will keep him out of action indefinitely.
That leaves true freshman Brock Edwards and walk-on Cullen Loeffler as the
only able-bodied tight ends on the team. Brown said Edwards will start
Saturday, and he said FB Chad Stephens, a former TE, will be cross-trained
so
he can fill in at both positions. TB Ivan Williams also will be
cross-trained
at fullback, he said.
He also said OT Robbie Doane has been moved to guard because Antwan
Kirk-Hughes' shoulder injury is limiting his playing time. He said the
Longhorns had to play starting OTs Leonard Davis and Mike Williams late in
the Missouri game "because they were the only healthy tackles we had." He
also said redshirt freshman OG Tillman Holloway "played his best game
Saturday. He played 53 snaps and did a good job."
Brown said DT's Shaun Rogers (ankle) and Marcus Tubbs (shoulder) also are
ailing, and he said he hopes both of them can play Saturday. He said
freshman
Adam Doiron might have to give up his redshirt year unless both of them are
able to play.
On the plus side, Brown said QB Major Applewhite is getting better each
week.
"He came into this year with a hurt knee and he didn't have a lot of
confidence in the knee," Brown said, "but he looked like the old Major
(against Missouri) for the first time" since he was injured in the Cotton
Bowl game against Arkansas.
Brown also said freshman WR Sloan Thomas, who caught two touchdown passes
Saturday in his first extended action, "is going to be a really good
player.
He's been making plays like that in practice, so we decided to play him
more." Brown said redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis is out with a sore shin
and he doesn't know when he will return. Ellis also was hampered during his
redshirt year with a stress fracture in his shin, and it isn't good news
that
the same shin is sore again.
Asked how he can get his team ready to play a Baylor team that has been
shut
out in its last three games, Brown said, "We need to worry more about us
than
our opponents. We just need to be a better football team. We have to get
ourselves ready, and this is a team that hasn't always done that."
The Longhorns can beat Baylor even if they aren't fired up, but the road
gets
much tougher the following two weeks with road trips to Texas Tech and
Kansas. Fox TV has picked the Texas-Texas Tech game for its 6 p.m. national
telecast on Nov. 4.
* * * *
FOOTBALL RECRUITING  NOTES: Super DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison said
he
came to the Missouri game Saturday, but got there late and didn't get to
visit with the other recruits. Harris said he had a good time and said
Texas
remains one of his top choices. . . Fullback James Buchanon of Sarasota,
Fla., says he will announce his college choice Tuesday afternoon at 1:30
p.m.
He has been considering FSU, Texas and Boston College, but he took a visit
to
FSU last weekend and said he had a great time, so the Seminoles think they
have him.
* * * *
BASKETBALL RECRUITING  NOTES: Two walk-ons, including a former scholarship
player at North Texas State, have been added to the UT basketball team,
coach
Rick Barnes announced Monday. They are  6-6 junior guard/forward Deginald
Erskin and 6-1 freshman point guard Drew Gressett. Erskin, a cousin of
former
Longhorn Kris Clack, is from Gonzales. He played at North Texas State for
two
years, averaging 12.3 points as a freshman and 18.9 points as a sophomore.
He
will have to sit out this year, but can practice with the team. Gressett
was
an All-District guard at Austin Westlake last season, averaging 15 points
and
6 assists per game.

It's looking pretty bad.....I thought that I'd be mostly done writing, but
I'm not.  I could be here for awhile.  I'm not sure what I'm gonna do.  I
will try to write you more later.  When do you think you'll be leaving work?

Love you,
Jenn

Part 2 of 3

Horns Rack Up Four More Commitments, Now Have 11

The Longhorns added four more recruit commitments since my June newsletter,
including two who have made one or more national top 100 lists, a third who
is one of the nation's top track stars and a fourth one who is big and fast.
Headlining the commitments are two players who are on one or more national
top 100s this year and who were being recruited by top schools across the
country.
The two who are top national recruits are TE David Thomas, 6-3, 210, 4.6, of
Wolfforth Frenship, and OL Neal Tweedie, 6-5, 255, 4.9, of Allen.
The top track man is MLB Brian Robison, 6-3, 243, 4.6, of Splendora, one of
the nation's top shot and discus throwers, and the one with the extra gear is
LB Marcus Myers, 6-3, 220, 4.5, of Pflugerville Connally.
Thomas, who caught 57 passes from UT recruit Kendal Briles for 1,104 yards
and 14 TDs last year, chose the Horns over Oklahoma and Texas Tech. He also
had offers from Texas A&M, LSU, Purdue, Oklahoma State and Baylor. He had
attended camps at his big three - Texas, Oklahoma and Texas Tech - before
picking the Longhorns.
When I asked him what factors led him to choose Texas, he said, "It has been
a dream of mine since I was a little boy to play football for the University
of Texas. This is a dream come true for me."
He also is an outstanding linebacker and had 141 tackles last year.He is on
Dave Campbell's Texas Football Super Team as a linebacker.
But Texas and most of the other schools after him see him as a tight end. He
will make the tough catch across the middle and then do something with it. He
also is very sure handed and is a devastating blocker.
He's also a fine student, with a 4.0 GPA on a 4-point scale and a  27 ACT
score.
College coaches love to talk about offensive line prospects who have quick
feet.
Tweedie's feet are so quick that he is one of the best pass blockers I have
seen in recent years, and they also are so quick that he had 22 scholarship
offers when he committed to Texas in June.
Tweedie said he was planning  "to look around a lot before I did anything,
but Texas just kind of blew me away and I committed to coach Hardee McCrary
and coach (Mack) Brown."
"I didn't go to any camps," he said, "but I went to Notre Dame and Texas A&M
and Texas to look around. I had planned to go to Oklahoma, too, to take a
look, but Texas just really impressed me and I decided to go ahead and commit
to Texas and get it all behind me."
Tweedie also is a  very good student, with a 3.7 GPA on a 4.0 scale and a
1080 SAT score.
Robison is one of the rare high school track per-formers who has thrown the
shot more than 60 feet and hurled the discus more than 200 feet.
There are some 60-foot shot putters every year and a few 200-foot guys in the
discus, but there have only been a handful of guys  in the last decade who
have done both.
He broke the AAU national age group record with  a 200-04 3/4 discus throw in
June at an AAU track meet  in San Antonio and also has a 62-7 shot put and a
172-10  javelin throw. He has qualified for the national AAU Junior Olympic
finals in Virginia later this week in all three events.
Robison said he plans to compete in both sports at Texas. He said he met
Brown and several other UT coaches and players after competing in the State
Track Meet in May.
Asked what caused him to pick Texas, he said, "Coach Brown was just totally
honest with me and answered all my questions without hesitation. The players
at Texas all told me he's a straight shooter."
Robison, who plays middle linebacker at Splendora, said the Texas coaches
recruited him as a middle backer. He had 116 tackles, 6 sacks, 6 passes
broken up, 2 fumble recoveries and a pass interception last season.
He also had offers from LSU and Houston, and said coaches from Arkansas, Penn
State, Oklahoma and Texas A&M had told him they would offer if he would visit
their schools.
Robison is a strong student, with a 3.9 GPA on a 4.0 scale and a  qualifying
SAT score.
Myers committed to the Longhorns  after getting an offer following a summer
camp at Texas.
His parents are both Texas Tech graduates and his father, Rufus, was a
running back for the Red Raiders in the late 1970s.
Myers said he had offers from Iowa State, TCU and Oklahoma State, and he said
Nebraska and Oklahoma coaches had told him he would get an offer if he came
to their summer camps, but he said he just wanted to play for Texas.
Connally coach Matt Monzingo said Myers is one of his fastest players,
despite his big frame.
But Monzingo also said Myers' future is at linebacker because "he's got a
great nose for the ball. He's really good at sniffing out where the play is
going and he's very aggressive. With his size and speed, he's got the whole
package to be an outstanding linebacker."
Monzingo said Myers played inside linebacker in a four-backer set last year,
and will play middle linebacker in a three-linebacker set this season.
Myers also is a fine student. He has a 4.5 on a  5.0 scale, ranks in the top
10% of his class and scored a 1,080 on the SAT last October.
The Longhorns still have 11 commitments, including six guys who have been on
one or more national top 100 lists. They are  Tweedie, Thomas, OL Brett
Valdez of  Brownwood, and DTs Sonny Davis of Gulf Coast JC in Mississippi
(who was on all the top lists last year when he was a senior at Austin
Lanier), Earl Anderson of San Marcos and Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale
Chaparral.
The other commited players are QB Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar,
RB-Athlete Clint Haney of Smithson Valley and WR Dustin Miksch of Round Rock
Westwood.

pass back 52 yards for the only Texas touchdown and it was enough to lead his
All-Star team to a 10-7 victory over the California All-Stars.
It was a sweet victory for the Texas All-Stars, who had lost the first six
games in the series.
California DT Kaelen Jakes, another Longhorn signee, had a sack for the
losers, and he told me Mike Garcia, the Galena Park offensive lineman who
also signed with UT, "is by far the best offensive lineman I've ever played
against, and I played against some guys in California who were supposed to be
among the best in the country."
OL Will Allen of Cypress Falls, another UT signee who played in the game,
told me he helped block Jakes "and he's every bit as good as Shaun Cody."
Cody, a heralded California DL who signed with USC, also played in the game.
The stout Texas defense held California to minus 13 yards rushing.
All of Texas' signees except LB Yamil LeBron of Killeen Ellison have
qualified. LeBron will attend a junior college.

WR Marquis Johnson of Champaign, Illinois, made it to the state of  Texas
this weekend, but he never made it to Austin.
He says he visited a friend in the Dallas area and wanted to get to Austin,
but never made it.
He said he definitely will take an official visit to Texas and is still
strongly considering the Longhorns.
QB/Athlete Paul Thompson of Leander picked Oklahoma over Texas Sunday,
primarily because he wants to play quarterback and the Sooners were
recruiting him for that position, while the Horns were recruiting him to play
wide receiver.
FB-LB Brandon Hancock of Clovis, Cal., told me he really enjoyed his
unofficial visit to Texas, but is 90% sure he'll sign with a California
school.
Here's a quick look at the main players Texas is still recruiting:
QB -  Vincent Young, Houston Madison
RB - Albert Hardy, Galena Park
TE - Eric Winston, Midland Lee
WR - Marquis Johnson, Champaign, Ill.; Robert Timmons, Flower Mound Marcus;
Anthony Wright, Klein Forest; Damien Collins, Dallas Bryan Adams, and Biren
Ealy, Cypress Falls.
OL - Justin Blaylock, Plano East, and Tony Ugoh, Spring Westfield.
DE - Travis Leitko, The Woodlands; Larry Dibbles, Lancaster; Dontriel Coates,
Anahuac; Tully Janszen, Keller; Chase Pittman, Shreveport Evangel, and Bryan
Pickryl, Jenks, Okla.
DT - Roderique Wright, Alief Hastings; Marco Martin, Mesquite; Joseph
Edwards, Dayton, and Tauren Brown, Katy Cinco Ranch.
LB - Marvin Byrdsong, Longview; Garnett Smith, Arlington Lamar; Glenn
Jackson, Carrollton Turner; Aaron Harris of North Mesquite and Roman Taylor
of Diboll.
DB - Ricky Wilson, Port Arthur Lincoln; Donald Burgs, Houston Madison;
Vickiel Vaughn, Plano West; Brodney Pool, Houston Westbury, and Matthew
Melton, Tyler.
Ath - Edorian McCullough, North Garland, and DaBryan Blanton, Forney.
The Horns obviously can't take all those receivers, defensive linemen,
linebackers and defensive backs, but they are recruiting the ones mentioned
right now and hope to sign several of the top ones.

Stephens Makes National Team

UT sophomore Stacy Stephens was one of 12 top players aged 19-and-younger who
made the USA Basketball Women's Junior National Team.
Stephens, a 6-1, center-forward, was one of the team's top rebounders and got
10 boards in the final game in the Junior World Championships in the Czech
Republic to help the USA team win the bronze medal with a 6-1 record.

Slugger Commits to UT

Brent Clevlen, 6-1, 185, 4.5, of Round Rock Westwood, one of the state's top
junior baseball hitters, has committed to play for Texas.
Clevlen, who also is a fine quarterback in football, hit  .455 and blasted 11
home runs last season after hitting .515 as a sophomore.
He also had offers from several other top baseball schools, including Baylor,
Rice, Texas A&M, Houston and Tulane.

 Simms Throws 4 TD Passes, Benson Rushes
For 157 Yards as Longhorns Gore Tigers, 35-16

Junior QB Chris Simms and true freshman RB Cedric Benson had career-best days
and the UT defense held Missouri to just one first down in the first and
third quarters Saturday in Columbia to lead Texas to a 35-16 victory.
On a day when upsets reigned across the country, particularly in the top 10,
and five of the eight previously unbeaten teams lost, the Longhorns took care
of business and ran their record to 7-1 overall and 4-1 in the Big 12.
With Oklahoma's 20-10 loss at Nebraska, the Sooners, Longhorns and Aggies are
all tied atop the standings in the Big 12 South.
But the Longhorns have to win out and Oklahoma has to lose another conference
game for the Longhorns to make it to the Big 12 Championship Game.
Saturday's victory at Missouri was a fairly easy conquest, thanks to the
stout UT defense and a great performance by the offensive line that allowed
Simms to complete 24 of 30 passes (80%) for 229 yards and four touchdowns and
Benson to run for 157 yards on 31 carries, an average of 5.1 yards a pop.
But some strange things happened to thwart the Longhorns in the early going.
On their first drive, for example, they held the ball almost 10 minutes,
rolling 78 yards in 19 plays, but they got zero points because they stalled
at the Tiger 2 and Dusty Mangum missed the chip-shot field goal.
They also drove into Missouri territory on their second possession, but again
stalled.
Missouri finally got rolling to start the second quarter and scored first.
That seemed to wake up the Longhorn offense and it took control and wore out
the Missouri defenders.
Here, briefly, is how the game went
First Quarter
Texas won the toss and deferred. Missouri took the ball and Marcus James ran
the UT kick back to the 38. The Longhorn defense forced a quick three-and-out
and the UT offense had its most time-consuming drive of the year, going 78
yards in a laborious 10-minute, 19-play drive to the Tiger 2, but Dusty
Mangum missed the chip-shot field goal. Missouri went three-and-out again.
The Horns drove to midfield again, but stalled as the quarter ended. Texas
had a huge lead in statistics, with 7 first downs to 0 for Missouri, a 99-24
edge in total offense, and a 12:03 to 2:57 bulge in time of possession, but
the game was all even at 0-0 in the only statistic that counts.
Second Quarter
The Tigers finally got their offense untracked to start the second quarter
and drove 76 yards, primarily on the passing of QB Kirk Farmer, to take a 7-0
lead with 11:12 left. Victor Ike ran the kickoff back to the 36 and the
Longhorns went 64 yards in 10 plays to tie it up. Simms connected with WR B.
J. Johnson on the 5-yard TD toss, but the big play was a 27-yarder from Simms
to TE Bo Scaife on third-and-2 at the Missouri 32. Mangum's kick tied it,
7-7, with 5:44 left. After the UT defense forced another quick 3-and-out and
got a short punt, Simms found Scaife again on the first play for a 28-yard
gain to the MU 13. A WR reverse by Johnson got 5 yards and Benson got 5 more
and a first down at the 3 before Simms faked to Benson and hit TE Brock
Edwards for the final 3 yards and the TD. Mangum's kick gave Texas a 14-7
lead with 1:50 left. The Tigers stormed down the field in the final two
minutes, primarily on the running of 5-10, 225-pound Zack Abron, who gained
37 yards in three carries. His 16-yard tackle-breaking run to the 5 gave the
Tigers a first-and-goal, but his next try gained only a yard and Farmer threw
two incompletions before Brad Hammerich booted a 22-yard field goal to cut
the UT lead to 14-10 with 7 seconds left. The Tigers outgained the Longhorns
in the quarter, 120 to 104 yards and had a 9-5 edge in first downs.
Third Quarter
Texas got the ball and again made a long, time-consuming drive, but this time
it counted because Simms scored from the 1 to cap a 73-yard drive and Mangum
converted for  a 21-10 lead with 8:50 left. the Longhorns overcame a
third-and-11 early in the drive when Simms scrambled and found Brett Robin
for 24 yards. Vasher intercepted Farmer four plays later to give the Horns
great field position at the MU 48. The Longhorns couldn't move, but the pick
kept Missouri bottled up deep in its own territory throughout the quarter and
allowed Texas to start its possessions around midfield in a quarter that was
dominated by defense after Texas' impressive opening drive.  The Tigers made
only one first down in the quarter and Texas, after getting five first downs
on that opening TD drive, managed only one more in the entire quarter.
Fourth Quarter
The Tigers finally figured out their best offense  was to hand the ball to
Abron and he bulled for 16, 19, 3 and then 7 more for a TD. Missouri's pass
for a 2-point conversion failed and left UT on top, 28-16, with 7:41 left.
Not to be outdone, Benson shredded the Missouri defense for 11, 20 and then 4
before Simms scrambled left and found  Robin, who scampered the final 25
yards to complete a 39-yard scoring play. Mangum's kick gave Texas a 35-16
lead with 4:27 left.

Texas and the BCS

The next Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings will be a lot different
from the first ones that were announced last week and Texas will be a lot
higher than it was in the last one.
In the first standings, which were announced last Monday, Texas was ranked
No. 6 behind five teams with perfect records. The BCS standings are like golf
in that the lowest score is the best score.
Oklahoma came in at No. 1 in the first standings at 3.06, followed by
Nebraska at 6.40, UCLA at 8.34, Miami at 12.01, Virginia Tech at 13.88, Texas
at 15.35 and Michigan at 15.91, to round out the top seven.
But a rash of upsets claimed OU, UCLA and Virginia Tech.
Since OU lost to Nebraska, the Sooners won't tumble far, but Texas should
pass UCLA and VT. Of course, Michigan is so close to Texas that the
Wolverines might pass the Horns if they keep winning.
Under the BCS formula, the top four teams in the final standings are
guaranteed berths in one of the four BCS Bowls, which are the Rose, Orange,
Fiesta and Sugar.
The Rose Bowl will get the national title game this year. Right now, that
looks like a Nebraska-Miami battle, but both teams have some big games left
before making that date.
Texas could make it to the Rose Bowl, but it would require some big upsets,
like Texas A&M or Texas Tech upsetting Oklahoma, and then Texas beating
Nebraska in the Big 12 title game.
But the Longhorns will make it to one of the big BCS bowls if they keep
winning.

Key Games for BCS Watchers

If you want to keep tabs on the Longhorns' chances to wind up in good shape
in one of the big four BCS bowls, the key is that they have to win their
final three regular season games.
Assuming that happens, here are some key games to watch for the rest of the
season:
This Saturday's key games are Michigan at Michigan State, Tennessee at Notre
Dame and UCLA at Washington State.
The big ones the following Saturday, Nov. 10, are Texas A&M at Oklahoma and
UCLA at Oregon.
On Nov. 17, Texas Tech hosts Oklahoma, Syracuse is at Miami, Michigan is at
Wisconsin and Virginia Tech is at Virginia.
On Thanksgiving weekend, Michigan hosts Ohio State, Nebraska goes to Colorado
and Oklahoma State plays at Oklahoma.
The big games on Dec. 1 are Miami at Virginia Tech, Tennessee at Florida and
Oregon State at at Oregon.
If Oklahoma loses to A&M, Tech or OSU and the Longhorns win out, Texas would
qualify for the Big 12 Championship Game on Dec. 8.
The final BCS rankings will be released on December 9, the day after the Big
12 and Southeastern Conference have their championship games.
Texas probably will be fourth or fifth in the BCS rankings to be released
today and the games mentioned above will be big determining factors in where
the Horns wind up.

Jackson, McClintock to Redshirt

It looks like senior LB Lee Jackson and junior DE O. J. McClintock will
redshirt.
Both have been out with injuries all season and head coach Mack Brown said
last week there are no plans to play them.
He said Jackson is still having troubles with his toe and his leg. He said
McClintock won't play unless the team suffers some injuries at DE.

Coach's Corner

The Longhorns, now ranked No. 5 in both polls after a rash of upsets
Saturday, are playing well, but they need to keep working to get better, head
coach Mack Brown said Sunday.
After studying films of the 35-16 victory over Missouri, Brown said he and
his assistants were generally pleased with the team's play.
But he said the defense will work on hard on tackling this week. "We weren't
pleased with out tackling," Brown said. "We weren't pleased one back gained
over 100 yards on us. We've got to get back to work on that."
He also said the defense did a good job in permitting Missouri to get into
the red zone only three times all day "but they scored all three times.
That's not what we want."
The offense played a pretty good game, he said, adding that tackle Mike
Wiliams "played great. He's our offensive player of the week."
Defensively, he said the player of the week is CB Quentin Jammer, who held
the Tiger's nationally ranked WR Justin Gage to two receptions for 14 yards.
He was averaging 7.5 receptions per game and ranked second in the Big 12 in
that department.
Brown also said he is concerned about some aspects of the kicking game. "We
kicked two balls out of bounds on kickoffs," he said. "We've got some issues
there we've got to correct."
He said backup LB Reed Boyd, who plays on several of the kicking teams, "was
our special teams player of the week."
Asked how he prepares his team for games like the next two, against Baylor
and Kansas, when the opponents are losing and struggling, he said, "Baylor
played A&M and Oklahoma tough. Our guys need to play football because they
like playing it. If they can't get excited about playing football, they don't
need to be playing football at the University of Texas."
He also said, "Our guys need to understand that everyone wants to knock them
off."

Part 3

Big 12 Roundup

Nebraska ran its home winning streak to 20 games and ended Oklahoma's string
of 20 straight victories Saturday in Lincoln.
Nebraska continues to lead the Northern Division with a perfect record, but
Oklahoma fell into a three-way tie with Texas and Texas A&M in the Big 12
South at 4-1.
The most important game this week has Texas A&M playing at Texas Tech. The
Red Raiders have been hard for the Aggies to handle in Lubbock in recent
years.

Buckman Picks Horns

Brad Buckman, a 6-9, 235-pound power forward from Austin Westlake who was
recruited by most of the nation's top programs, picked Texas Tuesday, saying
he thinks the Horns are on the verge of joining the national elite in
basketball.
He chose Texas over North Carolina at the end, but also had considered
Kentucky, UCLA, Missouri and others.
He had said earlier that the lure of the ACC, where basketball reigns
supreme, was very strong and almost pulled him to North Carolina.
But he told me Tuesday, "I've always wanted to go to Texas. This is where my
heart is."
He also said his head turned Texas' way at the end because coach Rick Barnes
has established a consistent winning program and has been wooing and winning
big-time recruits
"After looking at it closely," he said, "I think Texas basketball is really
on the upswing. They've signed two McDonald's All Americans (freshman point
guard T. J. Ford of Fort Bend Willowridge and sophomore forward Brian
Boddicker of Duncanville) in the last two years."
They could make it three in three years because Buckman's stock soared this
summer when he starred in several top AAU tournaments.
Brick Oettinger, publisher of Prep Stars Recruiter's Handbook, was asked who
was the biggest surprise of the summer.
Oettinger said, "In terms of from out of nowhere - not in anybody's top 100
to everybody's top 25 - it would be Brad Buckman. Big forward, very
aggressive and a whole lot of skills - just about as many skills as . . .
anybody in the class. I've got him No. 21 now and he wasn't in my top 100.
Dave Telep, another national recruiting analyst, agreed Buckman is a national
top 25 recruit.
"The reality is that while there are 25 guys with larger names, there
probably aren't 25 better players in the class," Telep said. "He is athletic,
can handle it some, he blocks shots, he shoots to medium-range and he scores
in the post."
Clifton McNeely, the Westlake coach, also says his star's work ethic is off
the chart.
"He's a very gifted player with a lot of talent," McNeely said, "but the best
thing about him is his strong heart and work ethic. I don't think you could
find anyone who works harder than he does." McNeely also said he thinks
Buckman "is the best player in Texas."
There are some guards in the Dallas area who ranked higher nationally,
including Bracy Wright of The Colony, who chose Indiana, Daniel Horton of
Cedar Hill, who picked Michigan, and Bryan Hopkins of Dallas Lincoln, who
committed to SMU.
The Longhorns recruited all three of those star guards, but lost out on them
at the end.
Buckman averaged 20 points, 11 rebounds and 5 blocks for Westlake as a
junior. And he's the kind of blue-collar inside player Barnes loves.
McNeely said Buckman can play a power game inside and shoot from 3-point
range.
Asked to compare him to Luke Axtell and Chris Mihm, two other Westlake
players he coached who played at UT, he said, "He has the physical presence
of Mihm and is a lot stronger coming out of high school, and he has the range
of Luke."
He is the first recruit to commit to Texas for the early signing period next
month.
Barnes and his assistants are recruiting several other players, most of them
in other states, and hope to sign a  sharp shooting guard and a wing.
Buckman's  father, Brent, played on two national championship golf teams at
UT.

Basketball Team Has New Look

The Longhorn basketball team will have a new look this season with the
addition of heralded point guard T. J. Ford, who led Fort Bend Willowridge to
back-to-back Class 5A state titles.
When the season starts next month, Ford will be called upon to speed up the
Horns' offense and also create more opportunities for the team's inside
players with his lightning-quick passes.
Coach Rick Barnes is hoping Ford's creativity in the half-court offense will
improve the scoring punch of center James Thomas, who averaged 7 points and
6.5 rebounds a game last year.
Ford also should be able to provide better shooting opportunities for senior
forward Chris Owens, sophomore wings Brandon Mouton and Royal Ivey, and 6-9
forward Brian Boddicker.
Barnes had to operate without a true point guard last year. Fredie Williams,
Ivey and shooting guard Darren Kelly took turns at the point.
Barnes and the Horns coped with it admirably, going 25-9 overall and 12-4 in
the tough Big 12, but they shot only 41.2 percent from the field and had 88
more turnovers than assists. Ford should help raise the former and lower the
latter.
They also lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Temple, and
Barnes hopes Ford will be a key to helping the team get farther into the
playoffs this season.
Replacing departed wing Maurice Evans and Kelley, who combined for 30.8 of
UT's 70.5 per-game scoring average, creates scoring opportunities for other
shooters. Now Barnes just needs some of them to seize that opportunity.
He expects Mouton and Ivey to step up there. Sydmill Harris, a 6-6 freshman
from The Netherlands, has been a consistent shooter in pre-season workouts.
Owens was a star in the World University Games during the summer and is
expected to be one of the top players in the Big 12, and a more dependable
scoring threat.
"Ever since last year, the Temple game, it started coming together," Owens
said. "It clicked. I didn't do what I wanted to do and I knew I had the
ability. Now I have the mental concentration."

UT Women Looking Sharp

Coach Jody Conradt's Longhorn women's basketball team is picked to finish in
the middle of the Big 12 pack, but early practices and stiff competition at
several positons indicate it might be a lot better than that.
The Longhorns were looking good early last season before losing
center-forward Annissa Hastings and guardTai Dillard to knee injuries.
Hastings and Dillard are hale and hearty once again, but equally important is
the fact that the Horns' heralded recruiting class is living up to its  hype.
Stacy Stephens, a 6-1 sophomore, returns as the starting center, and 6-2
senior Tracy Cook and the 6-1 Hastings can back her up and also play power
forward.
Jody Bell, a 6-2 freshman from Canada, and 6-1 freshman Mercedes Williams
also are looking good at power forward.
Two freshmen - 6-3 Heather Schreiber, the high school player of the year in
Texas last year, and 6-2 Kala Bowers, last year's high school player of the
year in Oklahoma - are battling for the small forward job (it shows you are
on the right track when you can call 6-3 and 6-2 women small forwards).
Hastings is so versatile that she probably will see action at all three
inside positions.
Kenya Larkin returns as the point guard and other guards who will see a lot
of action include sophomore Kaira White, who has been looking great in
practice, plus Dillard and freshman CoCo Reed.
Alisha Sare and Asha Hill are other guards who could figure into the rotation.
RECRUITING NOTES: LaToya Davis, 6-2, of Houston South Houston, picked Texas
Tech over Texas last week. Nichelle Roberts, a 6-1 center-forward who teamED
with Mercedes Williams to lead Spring Westfield deep into the state playoffs
last year, is the only remaining uncommitted blue chipper and the Longhorns
have a great chance to sign her.

No. 10 Horns Win Soccer Title

The No. 10 Texas women's soccer team clinched its first Big 12 Conference
title Sunday with a 3-1 victory over Oklahoma.
The Longhorns are 11-3 overall and 9-0 in the Big 12 and have one regular
season match remaining against Texas A&M.
Coach Chris Petrucelli, in his third year at the helm, said, "This is a huge
step for us. It's going to help us in recruiting. It's going to help us in
marketing. And it's going to help our confidence."
Freshman forward Kelly Wilson scored Texas' third goal Sunday, giving her 11
for the season and tying her with Carol Finch for the season record. Finch
set the record in 1996.
Lerrin Biggers scored Texas' first goal and Kylee Wosnuk got the second one.

Hi Sweetie,

How are you?  Are you working hard?  Hopefully, this email has my name
on it!  I haven't received an email from Jeff yet, but I hope he can
help me out.

I had a terrible night's sleep last night.  All I could think about is
how much I have to do and how little money I have.  I kept dreaming
about not getting things done fast enough.  It rained all night too.
The  thunder was so loud that it woke me up when I finally fell asleep.

Anyway, I'm gonna be ecstatic when this week is over!!!  It's going to
be so nice to relax with you.  All I have is one final to study
for...yeah, it's worth 30% but it's only one final!

If I have a chance I'll email you again later (esp. since I can't call
you this week).

5 more days of class.......

Love you,
Jenn

Simms Ties School Record with 5 TD Passes,
Benson Shines in First Start as UT Rips OSU

True freshman RB Cedric Benson got his first start Saturday in Stillwater and
his hard running opened the airways for QB Chris Simms to toss a
school-record-tying five touchdown passes en route to a 45-17 victory over
Oklahoma State.
The Cowboys started strong and scored on their first possession against the
Longhorns' man-for-man defense by hitting four third-and-long passes in a
row, the final one for a touchdown.
But defensive coordinator Carl Reese switched to zone coverage as his base
defense at that point and the Cowboys didn't hit another third-down pass all
day.
After the slow start that spotted OSU an early 10-0 lead, the UT offense
exploded for 31 points in the second quarter to put the game on ice.
Benson's early fumble set up Oklahoma State's field goal that put the Horns
in the 10-point hole, but his strong runs fueled the first three Texas
scoring drives, forcing the Cowboys to bring more defenders in close and
setting up the potent UT passing game. He carried 17 times for 92 yards  and
a 5.4 yard average in the first half en route to a 31-carry, 131-yard
performance for the day.
This was a day when the run complemented the pass and the pass complemented
the run, and it simply gave the outmanned Cowboys too many problems to solve.
Simms tried only four passes in the first quarter, completing two of them for
a mere two yards as the Horns concentrated on establishing Benson and the
ground game.
The strategy paid off handsomely, with the Cowboys putting seven and eight
defenders in the box to slow Benson, and Simms responded by com-pleting 16 of
28 passes for 233 yards and five TDs in the final three quarters.
The 5 TD passes tied a school record set by James Brown against Baylor in
1994.
Here, briefly, is how the game went
First Quarter
Texas won the toss and deferred until the second half. OSU took the ball and
Texas got the strong 18 mile-an-hour wind. QB Aso Pogi led the Cowboys on a
12-play, 65-yard touchdown drive after the kickoff. He overcame four
third-and-long situations by hitting four straight passes, the final one to
WR Rashaun Woods for nine yards and the TD for a 7-0 lead with 10:33 left.
After the kickoff, Benson fumbled on the second play and OSU recovered at the
UT 30. The Pokes tried the UT middle twice, but DT Marcus Tubbs and others
held strong, bringing up a third-and-11 at the 31. Now in a tight zone
defense, the Horns forced Pogi into an incompletion and Luke Phillips hit a
career-best 48-yard FG for a 10-0 lead with 8:14 left. The Horns went
backward on a penalty and a sack after the kickoff, forcing a punt from the
UT 11. But safety Nathan Vasher intercepted Pogi's long pass at the UT 21,
and Benson started shredding the Cowboy defense. He ran for 2, 12, 13, 8, 7,
3 and 10 yards to get the Longhorns to the OSU 25. Ivan Williams relieved him
briefly and got 5 and then 4 to bring up a third down at the 16. Benson got
the first down on a tough 2-yard run to the 14 as the quarter ended.
Second Quarter
Two more Benson runs reached the 9, then Simms hit WR Roy Williams just short
of the goal, then scored on a sneak on the next play. Dusty Mangum's kick cut
the deficit to 10-7 with 13:09 left. The Longhorn defense forced another
turnover when OSU RB Tatum Bell fumbled and UT safety Ahmad Brooks recovered
at the Cowboys' 15. Benson ran for 10 to the 5, but a penalty and a
stiffening OSU defense forced Mangum to come in and hit a 23-yard field goal
for a 10-10 tie with 9:27 left.LB Everick Rawls sacked Pogi and forced a
quick punt, and Vasher returned it 15 yards to the Cowboys' 46. Benson got a
first down with a 10-yard run, then Simms hit three straight passes, the
final one for 27 yards and the touchdown to wide open TE Brock Edwards.
Mangum's kick put the Horns ahead to stay, 17-10, with 6:13 left. After OSU
failed on a fourth-down gamble at the UT 38, Simms took the Horns on an
11-play, 64-yard scoring drive. His passes for 21 yards to Kyle Shanahan and
11 and 12 yards to Sloan Thomas were the big plays. He connected with
Williams for the final five yards and a 24-10 lead with just 25 seconds left.
The Horns tried a squib kickoff, and recovered it at the OSU 16, with 15
seconds left. Simms hit Williams down the middle for the touchdown and a
31-10 lead at the half.
Third Quarter
After an exchange of punts, Benson and Simms went to work again, running and
passing UT down to the OSU 27. Then Simms hit  Thomas again for 27 yards and
the TD. Mangum's fifth conversion  made it 38-10 with 6:46 left. OSU safety
Chris Massey intercepted a Simms' pass at the UT 21 late in the quarter, but
TB Richard Schwarz fumbled on the first play and Vasher recovered.
Fourth Quarter
With Ivan Williams relieving Benson and ripping off some good runs, the Horns
scored again early in the quarter on Simms' fifth TD pass, a 23-yarder to
Thomas. Mangum's kick gave Texas a 45-10 lead with 9:02 left. Massey returned
David Pino's kickoff 97 yards for an OSU touchdown to wrap up the scoring at
45-17 with 8:45 left. With Major Applewhite relieving Simms at QB, the
Longhorns drove deep into OSU territory on their next possession, but
declined to kick a short field goal on a fourth-and-3 and fell a yard short.

900 Number Updated Daily

I update my 900 number every day with football and football recruiting news.
The number is 1-900-288-8839. It costs $1.59 a minute. You must be 18 or
older to call.

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday the Longhorns have changed their offensive
philosphy to include more traps and counters, and he said true freshman
Cedric Benson has won the starting tailback job for the big game with
Colorado Saturday.
"We need to use more traps, run more gaps and counter gaps," he said, adding
that helps slow down blitzing linebackers and gives running backs a better
chance to break for long gains.
The Longhorns had great balance Saturday in their 45-17 victory at Oklahoma
State, rushing for 241 yards and passing for 238 yards.
"This was an important game for us," Brown said. "It was important for our
offense in general. It was important to get back on track and it was
important to have good balance."
The Longhorns are 28-0 under Brown when they outrush their opponents and 4-12
when they get outrushed, so it doesn't take a degree in rocket scientistry to
figure out why he wants to keep running the ball well.
Brown also said Benson "did really well" in his first start. "He was pretty
much mistake free and he got better as the game progressed."
"We expect him to be much better this week. He will understand that Colorado
is much tougher on defense (than Oklahoma State), so it will be a much
tougher test."
Brown said Benson, who broke all the Class 5A rushing and scoring records in
leading Midland Lee to three straight state titless, "has come a long way on
blocking because he wasn't asked to block much in high school. Stepping up
and taking on a hard-charging linebacker is a hard thing to do."
Brown also has stressed that he wants his backs to make yardage after being
hit and he said Benson did a very good job of that, getting 70 of his 131 net
rushing yards after contact.
He said Benson and the offensive line will have to do a really good job this
week to give QB Chris Simms and his receivers a chance to succeed.
"We've got to stay balanced on offense," he said. "Colorado has won five
games in a row and I watched them in their opener (a 24-22 loss to still
unbeaten Fresno State) and I thought Colorado outplayed them and had some
awful things happen to them."
He said Colorado's offensive line "probably will be better than anyone else
we play."
"I know Gary's (Colorado coach Gary Barnett) teams are going to line up and
be really physical. I think they are back to running the football and being
very physical and very sound."
INJURY REPORT: There were no new injuries in the OSU game and DE Kalen
Thornton (knee) and RB Victor Ike (bruised ribs), who missed that game,
remain questionable for Colorado.



First Issue of 12th Year

Last week's issue concluded my 11th year of publishing True Orange and this
is the first issue of my 12th year.
I want to thank all of you for helping make this  a successful undertaking
through all those years, and I'm excited about the future because the
Longhorn football team is on the right track again.

True Orange Speaking Note

Many of you have been asking me why I no longer speak at your Longhorn Club
meetings.
The answer is very simple. Somebody in the UT Athletics Department has
blackballed me.
In years past, many of the Longhorn Clubs, and particularly the ones in
Houston and San Antonio, invited me to speak to their members fairly
frequently. I always enjoyed doing it, and I hope you enjoyed having me.
If enough of you feel strongly enough about it, you can reverse that decision
to blackball me. If you don't, that's okay, too, because the main purpose of
this note is to let all of you know that I was not the one who made the
decision to stop speaking at Longhorn Club meetings.

Recruiting Roundup

The Longhorns haven't added any new recruits since my last newsletter. They
still have 15 commitments.
* * * *
The college coaches have found a big, fast linebacker that all the recruiting
gurus, including me, missed.
He is Michael Williams, 6-3, 220, 4.6, of Lindale, and attesting to his
blue-chip status are scholarship offers from Texas, Oklahoma, Texas A&M,
Baylor, Minnesota and West Virginia.
Williams has such speed and quickness that he plays wide receiver on offense.
And, in a year when many of the top players are struggling to qualify
academically, he already has passed that hurdle.
When I talked to him last week, he told me he already is getting weary of the
recruiting process and probably will commit to someone in "the next couple of
weeks."
He also said he plans to attend the Texas-Colorado game Saturday. The
Longhorns have a very good chance to get him.
With three starting senior linebackers, the Longhorns need to sign several
top prospects in this recruiting class.
* * * *
There are so many national top 100 recruiting lists available that it's hard
to keep up with which players are on which list, but one of the better ones
is the Rivals 100 list on the internet.
The Longhorns already have commitments from three players on that list - No.
21 WR Marquis Johnson of Champaign, Ill.; No. 80 DE Chase Pittman of
Shreveport Evangel and No. 83 OL Neale Tweedie of Allen.
Texas also has really good shots at seven other players on the Rivals 100.
They are:
No. 7. DT Roderique Wright of Alief Hastings, No. 11 QB Vincent Young of
Houston Madison, No. 16 OL Justin Blalock of Plano East, No. 32 WR Robert
Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus, No. 37 DE Larry Dibbles of Lancaster, No. 48
LB Aaron Harris of North Mesquite and No. 71 DT Marco Martin of Mesquite.
The Horns also are being mentioned favorably by seven other players on the
list, including No. 2 RB Lorenzo Booker of Ventura, Cal., St. Bonaven-ture,
No. 29 DE Bryan Pickryl of Jenks, Okla.,  No. 46 DE Zack Latimer of Aurora,
Colo., No. 49 DE Travis Leitko of The Woodlands, No. 59 TE Eric Winston of
Midland Lee, No. 75 Ath Edorian McCullough of North Garland, and No. 87 RB
Selvin Young of Jersey Village, and could wind up with one of two of them.
* * * *
Young lists Texas and Miami as his top two schools right now, but he is
pretty wide open.
If he isn't the top QB prospect in the country, he's very close to the top.
He has led Madison to a 6-0 season so far and, in a big district showdown
with powerful Houston Lamar Friday night, he had 10 carries for 181 yards,
including touchdown runs of 1 and 91 yards, and he completed 6 of 13 passes,
including an 81-yard touchdown toss, to lead Madison to a 50-38 victory.
For the season, he has completed 47 of 83 passes (57%) for 846 yards and 10
touchdowns, with just 3 interceptions, and he has rushed 37 times for 496
yards and 10 more TDs. That's a 13.4 average per carry, by the way.
He is a quarterback who could run Rice's option or Texas' passing attack. If
you could build the perfect QB, put another 25 pounds on his 6-5, 200-pound
frame without hurting his sub-4.5 speed and you would have a perfect 10. Put
him at a good training table and the 25 pounds of added muscle won't be a
problem.
He's one of the real jewels in this recruiting class and the Horns have as
good a shot as anybody and a better shot than most.

Artie Ellis Should Be Back at Practice Wednesday After X-Ray

Redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis, who suffered a stress fracture in his leg
in spring practice, was injured in Tuesday morning's Longhorn practice when
someone kicked him on the same leg. But coach Mack Brown said after the
evening workout that an X-Ray showed no damage. He said Ellis probably will
be back at practice Wednesday.
After losing TE Bo Scaife with a season-ending knee injury, the loss of
Ellis
would have been a severe blow to the team's receiving corps, and Brown said
he was elated when he found out the injury was minor. Ellis was held out of
the evening workout. Brown also said Scaife will undergo surgery on his
knee
Friday, and probably will be available for spring practice.
* * * *
Brown said Tuesday's first practice in full pads was a very good one, and
he
said he is pleased with the second-team offense and defense.
"Last season, our first teams just went right through our second teams," he
said. "Our second teams are much better this year. The first teams can't
just
line up and ran over them anymore."
He also said the first-team offensive line played extremely well Tuesday.
Offensive line coach Tim Nunez said Cory Quye has edged ahead of Mike
Williams for the starting job at right tackle, but he said both Quye and
Williams "are having great practices."
Nunez also said backup guard Tillman Holloway, a redshirt freshman, "has
done
a great job and is pushing for significant playing time."
* * * *
Freshmen WRs Roy Williams and B. J. Johnson both made several outstanding
catches Tuesday. Both also ran with the first team at times due to Ellis'
absence.
I asked Brown how soon a true freshman could move into the starting lineup
if
he demonstrated that he was better than the veterans. He said, "As soon as
we
would see he's good enough to play consistently well. We wouldn't want to
move him up and then move him down, but if some of them play well enough to
move up, it probably would be next week."
There is no question right now that Williams and Ellis are the team's top
two
WRs, with Johnson close behind them. If Williams and Ellis are both healthy
on Sept. 9, expect them to be the starters in the season opener against
Louisiana-Lafayette.
Defensive coordinator Carl Reese said freshmen DEs Kalen Thornton and Adam
Doiron have been looking good in practice. He said both of them should be
able to help the team this season. "They are big old boys who should be
able
to help us stop the run," he said. "They both have good quickness and they
are catching on fast."
* * * *
The Longhorns will have a scrimmage at 5 p.m. Wednesday at Royal Memorial
Stadium. Brown urged Longhorn fans to come and show their support for the
team.
* * * *
FOOTBALL NOTES: Josh Doiron, older brother of the freshman DE, is walking
on
as a TE. He attended Kansas State for a year on a football scholarship, but
quit the team and attended Oklahoma last year. He did not play football at
OU. After sitting out this year at Texas, he will have two years of
eligibility remaining. . . Brown said Hodges Mitchell is the Longhorns' No.
1
punt returner and Ivan Williams and Victor Ike are the top kickoff
returners.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: The Longhorns might sign a kicker this year. They have
two
good freshmen kickers, but Brown likes to have competition at every spot,
and
he probably will sign a kicker if he can find a great one. He would like to
find a punter who also can kick field goals.

My next fax will be Wednesday, August 23.

The state's top QB prospect, Matt Nordgren, 6-5, 217, 4.62, of Dallas
Bishop
Lynch, visited Texas A&M last weekend and plans to fly to Boulder with his
father this weekend to take a look at Colorado.
But he said his heart still belongs to the Longhorns. "I really like
Texas,"
he said. "I had a nice time at A&M, but I don't think anyone is going to
beat
Texas."
He said he probably will be ready to announce his college choice shortly
after returning from Colorado, and he said he is almost positive that
choice
will be Texas.
* * * *
James Buchanan, 6-2, 240, 4.7, of Cardinal Mooney HS in Sarasota, Fla., is
generally considered to be the nation's top fullback. He took an unofficial
visit to Texas last month and said UT was one of his leaders. Now, he says
his big three are Texas, Florida State and Miami and he said he hopes to
make
decision later this month. He is a tremendous blocker and a very tough
inside
power runner.
* * * *
Texas has 12 early commitments  including seven offensive linemen. They are
Terrance Young of Longview,  Mike Garcia of Galena Park,  Jonathan Scott of
Dallas Carter, Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village, Roman Reeves of
Livingston, Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls and Alfio Randall of Blinn
JC.
The other pledges are QB/DB Kendal Briles of Frenship, MLB Yamil Lebron of
Killeen Ellison, and DBs Cedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes, Braden
Johnson
of Euless Trinity and Brian Carter of The Woodlands.
Various natinal recruiting services are rating the Longhorns  current
recruiting class in the top three nationally at this point.

Jefferson LB Lance McFarland Says He Is Committing to Horns

Linebacker Lance McFarland, 6-1, 225, 4.6, of Jefferson told me tonight
(Tuesday) he is trying to call UT assistant coach Darryl Drake to commit to
the Longhorns.
"I just decided I was ready to get the recruiting process behind me," he
said. "I have always liked Texas and I'm ready to give my commitment."
He said he has scholarship offers from Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, Arkansas,
Kansas State and LSU.
McFarland has great speed for a linebacker. He won the so-called "fat boy
100" at an East Texas track meet with an 11.3 clocking after his sophomore
year. Only players who weighed more than 200 pounds competed in the event.
He will be the Longhorns' 14th commitment. The others are super RB Cedric
Benson of Midland Lee, OLs Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter, Abe Robinson of
Jersey Village, Matt Garcia of Galena Park, Will Allen of Cypress Falls,
Roman Reeves of Livingston, Terrance Young of Longview and Alfio Randall of
Blinn JC; LB Yamil Lebron of Killeen Ellison, CB Cedric Griffin of San
Antonio Holmes, WR-CB Brian Carter of The Woodlands, DB Braden Johnson of
Euless Trinity and QB/S Kendal Briles of Wolfforth Frenship.
Benson and Scott are national top 25 players and Robinson and Briles also
have made some national top 100 lists.
FB James Buchanon of Sarasota, Fla., DE Kaelen Jakes of Valencia, Cal., and
OL Williams Winston of Houston Madison all say they plan to come to the
UT-Houston game Sept. 23. Buchanon and Jakes will be taking their official
visits to Texas that weekend.
I said I wouldn't have any more faxes this week, and here this one is, but
it
is shorter than usual because I have a very early flight to California
Wednesday and I have to get this going so I can shut everything down before
I
leave. For those of you who normally get late faxes early the nexrt
morning,
I apologize for sending this one so late, but it was either do it now or at
4:30 a.m. tomorrow.

Part 3 of 3

Pre-Season Practice Schedule

Coach Mack Brown has announced the full pre-season football practice
schedule, but he stressed that all times and dates are tentative and could be
changed.
Here's the full schedule of practices that will be open to the public:
Monday, August 6 - Freshmen report
Tuesday, August 7 - Freshmen practices 10:30 a.m. & 5 p.m.
Wednesday, August 8 - Freshmen practices 9:15 a.m. & 5 p.m.
Thursday, August 9 - Varsity reports, no practice
Saturday, August 11 - First full-team practices 9 a.m. & 7 p.m.
Sunday, August 12 - Practice 3 p.m.
Monday, August 13 -  Practices 9 a.m. & 7 p.m.
Tuesday, August 14 - Practice 3 p.m.
Wednesday, August 15 - Practices 9 a.m. & 7 p.m. (afternoon practice first
one in full pads)
Thursday, August 16 - Scrimmage 3 p.m. at Royal Memorial Stadium
Friday, August 17 - Practices 9 a.m. & 7 p.m.
Saturday, August 18 - Scrimmage 9 a.m. at Royal Memorial Stadium
Sunday, August 19 - Media Day/Fan Appreciation Day 2-3:20 p.m., autographs
3:30-4:30 p.m.
Monday, August 20 - Practices 9 a.m. & 7 p.m.
Tuesday, August 21 - Practice 3 p.m.
Wednesday, August 22 - Practice 9 a.m., scrimmage 6 p.m. at Royal Memorial
Stadium
Thursday, August 23 - Practice 3 p.m.
All practices will be at Frank Denius Field at 26th & Red River and all
scrimmages will be at the stadium.
As I reported earlier, Brown is having more early morning and late evening
practices when the team practices twice daily, and is having only one
practice on days the team works during the hottest part of the day.
He said he is trying the new approach in an effort to avoid some of the

True Orange Observations

Texas' specific problems on offense, defense and special teams were addressed
in the lead story, but I think there are two general areas, one on offense
and one on defense, where improvement must be made for the team to finish in
the top 10 for the first time since 1983.
Offensively, the Longhorns were a feast-or-famine team in all the big games
last year and even in some of the ones that wound up being laughers.
I am referring to their problem with three-down possessions. In the rout of
the Aggies, for example, Texas had one first down in the entire first half
before exploding for four touchdowns in the third quarter. That's a bunch of
three-and-outs.
In the Oklahoma debacle, Texas made one first down while the Sooners were
scoring six touchdowns to put the game on ice early.
In the bowl loss to Oregon, Texas fell behind 14-0 in the first quarter, had
two long, back-to-back scoring drives to start the second quarter, but  had
minus yardage on its other second-quarter possession and then had only two
first downs in the entire third quarter when the Ducks came from behind to
start taking control.
I could cite more examples, but you saw the games and you know the team had a
problem with too many three-down possessions in a row in the losses and in
some of the victories.
Three-down possessions also hurt the defense because the defenders wind up
being on the field too long with little opportunity to rest.
One seldom mentioned reason Josh Heupel was such an effective quarterback for
OU was that he almost always moved the team for a first down or two, even on
drives that fizzled out. That kept his defense fresh and gave it a long field
to defend.
The Longhorn defenders, conversely, frequently had to defend very short
fields.
Let's hope the team is better at consistently moving the ball this year.
Defensively, the Longhorns ran man-for-man defenses a lot more than zones.
I know a couple of pro coaches who tell me the most effective pass defense is
one that keeps the opponents guessing about the coverage.
The hiring of Duane Akina as secondary coach, coupled with Mack Brown's
stated desire to mix up the pass coverage, should help in that area.
Another problem with man-for-man is that teams like OU frequently have a
pickoff man to block a cornerback and that can leave the cornerback's guy
wide open.
Still another negative against using all man-for-man is that zones are
usually more effective on long yardage plays because the zone can be used to
keep the defenders from getting deep quickly.
That was one reason the Longhorn defense gave up so many third-and-long plays
last season.
Let's hope that improves this year, too, and a more diversified coverage
would help a lot.

Four UT Games Already on TV

The Longhorns first three games and the regular-season finale at Texas A&M
will be televised.
The most recent one to be announced is the Sept. 22 game at Houston. ESPN2
had picked it for an 8 p.m. national telecast.
That is very good news because the game will be played in Robertson Stadium,
which seats only slightly more than 30,000.
The Sept. 1 opener against New Mexico State will have a 6 p.m. kickoff and
will be televised nationally by the Fox Network.
The Sept. 8 game against North Carolina also will be televised. That's the 
good news. The bad news is that it is set for an 11 a.m. kickoff. ABC will
televise the game regionally.
Let's hope it's a cloudy day, because the sun will keep the stadium very hot
unless some cloud cover is available.
If Athletic Director DeLoss Dodds and his party gave up their plush box and
sat out in the stands with the regular folks for the Carolina game, I don't
think we would have many mid-day kickoffs in September in the future.
The A&M game on Nov. 23 in College Station, will be televised nationally by
ABC at 11 a.m., too, but that won't pose a heat problem in late November.
It will pose a problem on where the Longhorn teams stays the night before the
game because I don't think Mack Brown will try College Station again after
the problems last time around.
The Aggies won't have that problem in 2002 when they come to Austin for an 11
a.m. game because visiting teams can count on Austin hotels to protect them
from harassment like annoying phone calls all night, no pre-game meal and all
the other little annoying things that happend to the Horns in College Station
last year.
ABC has worked out a deal with the Big 12 to televise the Texas-Texas A&M and
Nebraska-Colorado games for the next four years, with Texas and A&M getting
the 11 a.m. kickoffs and Nebraska and Colorado getting the 2:30 p.m. kickoffs
for the first two years, then switching times for the next two years.
Times for the remaining seven regular season games will be set later, and
most starting times won't be known until the television networks exercise
their options 12 days before each game.
Here's the complete schedule:
Sept. 1 New Mexico State, 6 p.m., Fox national TV
Sept. 8 North Carolina, 11 a.m., ABC regional TV
Sept. 22 at Houston, 8 p.m., ESPN2 national TV
Sept. 29 Texas Tech
Oct. 6 vs. Oklahoma at Dallas
Oct. 13 at Oklahoma State
Oct. 20 Colorado
Oct. 27 at Missouri
Nov. 3 at Baylor
Nov. 10 Kansas
Nov. 23 at Texas A&M, 11 a.m., ABC national TV

Horns Get Dutch Basketball Star
Sydmill Harris, a  6-6, 190-pound shooting guard for The Netherlands National
Team, has enrolled as a freshman at Texas and is eligible to play for the UT
basketball team this year.
Harris averaged 7.5 points in his first season with the national team after
leading the Dutch Junior National Team in scoring for four  seasons.
Longhorn players who have been working out with Harris report he lives up to
his reputation as a super shooter with outstanding range.
Two top juniors who are being nationally recruited, also are strongly
considering Texas. They are Brad Buckman, a 6-8, 230-pound forward from
Austin Westlake, and Rashad Anderson, a 6-5 shooting guard from Lakeland,
Florida.
Buckman and Anderson have shot to the forefront of the top national juniors
with outstanding play in AAU ball this summer. Buckman averaged 20 points and
10 rebounds last season and Anderson averaged 24 points a game..
T. J. Ford, the great point guard prospect who is a freshman at Texas this
year, has been diagnosed with a chronic spinal condition stemming from
abnormal openings in the spinal column that the spinal cord runs through.
Originally, surgery was planned to correct it, but team doctors and Ford and
his family decided not to have surgery at this time. He has played and
starred with the condition for several years.
He has resumed working out.

(I might have put the two shorties below in one of the earlier parts. If so,
I apologize)

Stephens Makes National Team

UT sophomore Stacy Stephens was one of 12 top players aged 19-and-younger who
made the USA Basketball Women's Junior National Team.
Stephens, a 6-1, center-forward, was one of the team's top rebounders and got
10 boards in the final game in the Junior World Championships in the Czech
Republic to help the USA team win the bronze medal with a 6-1 record.

Slugger Commits to UT

Brent Clevlen, 6-1, 185, 4.5, of Round Rock Westwood, one of the state's top
junior baseball hitters, has committed to play for Texas.
Clevlen, who also is a fine quarterback in football, hit  .455 and blasted 11
home runs last season after hitting .515 as a sophomore.
He also had offers from several other top baseball schools, including Baylor,
Rice, Texas A&M, Houston and Tulane.

Longhorns Blast Raiders, Run Record to 4-0;
Huge Showdown with OU Looms Saturday

Junior QB Chris Simms completed his first 10 passes and 235-pound sophomore
RB Ivan Williams bulled for 152 yards and two touchdowns to spark Texas to a
42-7 victory over Texas Tech Saturday night in Austin.
Simms had his sharpest performance as a Longhorn, completing 21 of 26 passes
for 224 yards and a touchdown, and scoring two TDs on 1-yard sneaks.
It also was easily Williams' best game. His strong runs gave the Longhorns
such balance that they scored on their first three possessions and kept the
Raiders' defenders guessing all night.
The Longhorn defense, coming out in a 3-4 and inserting sensational freshman
LB Derrick Johnson in place of DT Maurice Gordon, also rebounded strongly
after last week's poor showing in the victory over Houston.
The victory ran Texas' record to 4-0 for the first time since 1983.
But getting to 5-0 will prove a monumental task for the No. 5 Longhorns
because they will face defending national champion and No. 3-rated Oklahoma
Saturday at 2:30 p.m. in the teams' traditional showdown in the Cotton Bowl
in Dallas (see OU scouting report in second part)
Defensive coordinator Carl Reese, a staunch advocate of man-for-man pass
defense, fed Texas Tech's high-octane offense a steady dose of zone coverages
Saturday night.
He also got to use his favored man-for-man defense on occasion, but it was
primarily a tight zone with a lot of different looks that was responsible for
holding the Raiders to seven points.
The Longhorn defenders kept the dangerous Tech receivers in front of them,
making them catch the ball in the short flat most of the time, then try to
use their speed to make something big happen.
The Raiders' problem is that this Texas defense is speedy, too, and those
two-yard catches often became four-yard gains.
Consider these telling statistics - the Raiders couldn't run (11 carries for
36 net yards) and they threw 58 passes, completing 40 of them for 260 yards.
That's a net gain of just under 4.5 yards per pass and it's exactly 6.5 yards
per completion.
Raider coach Mike Leach, who had poked fun at Texas CBs Quentin Jammer and
Rod Babers and QB Chris Simms in pre-game comments, gave them little credit
in his post-game interview, then bristled when a Lubbock reporter asked him
about all the short passes Raider QB Kliff Kingsbury threw.
"I don't know who all those experts are that know so much about going
vertical," Leach said. "I would guess I know a lot more about going vertical
than they do. With that being the case, I thought we went vertical the right
number of times."
Their longest pass completion was 25 yards and they only scored 7 points, so
maybe they did and maybe they didn't.
What he didn't say was that the swarming UT defense didn't give the Raiders
much chance to go deep - or vertical - in his terminology.
Here, briefly, is how the game went
First Quarter
The Longhorns won the toss and deferred, so Tech took the ball. The UT
defense forced a quick punt. Simms led the Longhorns 80 yards in 11 plays,
hitting five straight passes, all of them to WR Roy Williams, for 49 yards.
Ivan Williams got the other 31 yards on six bullish runs, including the final
two yards for the TD. Dusty Mangum's kick gave Texas a 7-0 lead with 7:49
left. After another Tech punt, the Longhorns struck again, going 74 yards in
nine plays. Simms was 3-for-3 on the drive, hitting WR B. J. Johnson twice
for 23 yards and TE Bo Scaife once for 5 yards. But Ivan Williams had the big
play, a 30-yard run to the Raiders' 21. Simms got the TD on a 1-yard run.
Mangum's kick gave Texas a 14-0 lead with 1:26 left. The Longhorns totally
dominated the quarter, leading 8-3 in first downs, 77-20 in rushing yardage,
77-44 in passing yardage and 154-64 in total offense. But the Raiders were
driving for the first time as the quarter ended.
Second Quarter
Tech's Ricky Williams squirted through a huge hole on a fourth-and-1 and
dashed 31 yards for a touchdown on the second play of the quarter, cutting
the UT lead to 14-7 just 33 seconds deep. But the Longhorn offense retaliated
immediately. Victor Ike returned the kickoff to the UT 47, and Simms found
Roy Williams with a 40-yard TD pass two plays later. Mangum's kick gave Texas
a 21-7 lead with 13:00 left. Tech drove to the UT 9 late in the half, but LBs
DeAndre Lewis and Tyrone Jones stopped Kingsbury a yard short of a first down
on a keeper that got to the UT 7. Simms was 13 for 15 for 130 yards and a
touchdown at the half. TE Bo Scaife who had 5 receptions for 64 yards, had a
rare drop, and Simms' other incompletion was one he threw away under a big
rush.
Third Quarter
The Longhorns put the game on ice with two touchdowns in a 46-second span
early in the second half. They drove 80 yards in 10 plays to start the half.
Ivan Williams got the touchdown on  a 1-yard run. He had six carries for 39 y
ards on the drive and Simms hit Scaife twice for 37 yards. Mangum's kick gave
Texas a 28-7 lead with 10:44 left. Derrick Johnson ripped the ball out of
Ivory McCann's grasp on the kickoff and walk-on Richard Hightower recovered
at the Tech 13. Williams carried twice to the 1, then Simms scored on a
sneak. Mangum's kick put UT on top, 35-7, with 9:58 left. Neither team
threatened again in the quarter.
Fourth Quarter
Tech drove to the Texas 15 early in the fourth quarter, but a fourth-down
pass fell incomplete. Texas came back with a 12-play, 85-yard scoring drive.
Simms gave way to Major Applewhite during the drive. Ike got the touchdown on
a 1-yard run. Redshirt freshman RB Sneezy Beltran got his first three carries
of the year on the final Texas' possession, netting six yards.

Game Quotes . .

"We didn't play as well as we should have tonight. We got stopped at key
times on all sides of the ball and didn't play together as well as Texas did.
The Longhorns deserve a lot of credit for their effort."
- Texas Tech head coach Mike Leach
* * * *
"These spread offenses are like the wishbone. If they know what you're doing
and where you're going to line up, they'll get you. With that kind of
offense, you've got to play around a little, give them a two-man rush, a
three-man rush, just keep them guessing. We've got another offense like that
coming up this week (Oklahoma). We can't just do the same things we did
tonight. We'll have to come up with some new wrinkles."
- Texas defensive coordinator Carl Reese
* * * *
"We ran for more than 200 yards and we passed for more than 200 yards. Chris
(Simms) played extremely well. I think his best game is yet to come. He gets
better each week. I think he's playing within himself."
- UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis, talking about the offense in general
and answering a question about whether this was Simms' best game
* * * *
"The line did a great job of blocking. We go out every Saturday and play the
game like it's the national championship game. OU will be a great game and
we're looking forward to the challenge."
- Longhorn RB Ivan Williams, who had a career best 152 yards rushing
* * * *
"We showed them some things they hadn't seen before from us. It was a lot of
fun.."
- Texas' senior LB De'Andre Lewis
* * * *
"Roy (Williams) split the two safeties. They gave us the look we wanted. It
was a great call by coach (Greg Davis). They gave us the middle of the field
all night."
- UT QB Chris Simms, talking about his 40-yard touchdown pass to Roy Williams
and the Raider defense
* * * *
"It's not like getting an extra cornerback in there, but our linebackers are
all pretty fast. It was a lot of fun getting to play most of the game.
- UT freshman LB Derrick Johnson, who got his first start, talking about the
3-4 defense
* * * *
"They did what they needed to do, running and passing the football. We got a
tail kicking."
- Tech defensive coordinator Greg McMackin
* * * *
"We had opportunities, but we struggled in the red zone early. In the second
half, the wheels just came off. I have to take my hat off to the Longhorns.
They played a great game tonight."
- Raider QB Kliff Kingsbury

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday a thorough study of Saturday night's game film
by all of the Texas coaches showed "nearly everybody played well" for the
Longhorns.
He also said the team has improved since the beginning of the season and said
it is important that it continue to improve.
"We feel good about where we are," he said. "We'll know a lot more after
Saturday because this will be by far the best team we have played."
He was referring, of course, to the upcoming meeting in Dallas with Oklahoma.
Brown said it was really important for the players to focus on the Texas Tech
game last week.
"We're really excited about the way the guys played," he said. "It was a
tough game to play because so many people were already talking about the
Oklahoma game."
"We told our team last week the OU game wouldn't be nearly as important to us
if we didn't beat Texas Tech, and Texas Tech is a good football team that we
knew would come in here and play us hard."
He said the Longhorns new 3-4 defense, with freshman LB Derrick Johnson
replacing DT Maurice Gordon, worked great against Tech because "it gave us
more speed."
Against more run-oriented teams, he said the Longhorns' base defense will
still be the 4-3.
"We felt going into the kind of offenses we're going into (Tech and
Oklahoma), we needed to change it up, play some zone, try to give the
quarterback some indecision and keep the ball in front of us."
"We've been using it since the spring, but we didn't feel like we needed it
against Houston," Brown said.
He also said the three starting linebackers, all seniors "have been playing
the best since we've been here." He said Johnson "is just so talented that we
needed to get him in there, and we can do that in a 3-4 with an extra
linebacker."
"We've been losing three games a year since we got here," Brown said. "In the
games we lose, we've been giving up too many big plays, playing too much man
for man."
He said the use of some zone coverages in the secondary helps the defensive
backs "keep the receivers in front of them, helps eliminate some of those big
plays."
Offensively, he said the Horns are much better this year than they were last
year at this time.
"Chris (Simms) has a lot more experience. The receivers have more
experience," he said. "We're blocking better, we're running better. Last year
we weren't able to run the ball consistently and we had one quarterback who
was hurt some (Major Applewhite) and one who hadn't played much (Simms), and
that really hurt us."
He said Simms is playing much better than he did early last year and he said
the emergence of TE Bo Scaife has helped the offense.
Scaife was supposed to be a weapon last year, but suffered a season-ending
knee injury during the pre-season drills.
"My goal, and the assistant coaches' goal, is to make this team the best team
it can be," he said. "We also want to continue to improve, to be a better
team at the end of the year than we were at the beginning."

 UT Baseball Team in Regional; Football Recruiting Picking Up Steam

 The slumping Longhorn baseball team made the 64-team NCAA Touarnment
 field,=20
 getting a No. 3 seed in a sub-regional at Stanford.
 The Longhorns, 34-24 overall after going 0-2 despite a No. 3 seed in the
 Big=
 =20
 12 Tournament, also got a No. 3 seed in the Palo Alto tourney. The
 Longhorns=
 =20
 will play No. 2 seed Long Beach State (35-21) in a first-round game Friday
 =20
 at 5 p. m. Texas time (3 p.m. Pacific time) in the double-elimination=20
 tournament.
 Stanford, the top seed at 42-14, will play No. 4 seed Marisa (32-19) in
 the=20
 other first round game Friday.
 The first-round losers will play an elimination game at 1 p.m. Texas
 time=20
 Saturday, with the first-round winners meeting at 5 p.m. Texas time. At
 that=
 =20
 point, one team will be 2-0 and will advance to the finals. The other
 two=20
 surivivors will be 1-1 and will play an elimination game at 9 p.m. Texas
 tim=
 e=20
 Saturday.
 The Saturday night survivor will meet the unbeaten team at 3 p.m. Texas
 time=
 =20
 Sunday. If the unbeaten team  wins, the tourney is over. If it loses, the
 tw=
 o=20
 teams will meet again at 7 p.m. Sunday for the title.
 The 16 survivors of the sub-regionals will meet in two-team super
 regionals=20
 June 1-3 at sites to be determined. All of the super regionals will be
 best=20
 two out of three series.
 Suspended pitcher Albert Montes has rejoined the team after missing the
 Big=20
 12 tourney.
 Big 12 champion Nebraska is seeded No. 1 and is hosting a sub regional.
 Texa=
 s=20
 Tech is a No. 3 seed at Cal State Fullerton. Oklahoma State is a No. 3
 seed=20
 at a sub regional at Tulane. Baylor is a No. 4 seed at Rice, which is
 seeded=
 =20
 No. 1 in its regional.
 * * * *
 Basketball coach Rick Barnes apparently has no plans to add another
 recruit=20
 in the wake of junior forward Maurice Evans' surprising decision to hire
 an=20
 agent, which makes him ineligible to return for his senior year. Evans
 had=20
 said earlier he was going to make himself available for the NBA draft,
 but=20
 Barnes and everyone else expected him to return. By hiring an agent, he
 made=
 =20
 that impossible.
 Evans is a good college player, but, at 6-5, he is not an accomplished=20
 dribbler and there are no 6-5 guys in the NBA who are not accomplished=20
 dribblers. I don't know what he will be doing next basketball season, but
 I=20
 will be shocked if he is playing in the NBA.
 * * * *
 The Longhorn football coaches have wrapped up four weeks of travel and
 talen=
 t=20
 evaluation, and now they are zeroing in on the top prospects they have
 found=
 .
 There are a lot of kids who already are well known, but four players
 really=20
 shot to the top of many college lists during the evaluation period. They
 are=
 =20
 CB Michael Hawkins, 6-1, 180, 4.4, and LB-DE Glenn Jackson, 6-2, 220,
 4.6,=20
 both of Carrollton Turner; OL Tony Ugoh, 6-4, 275, 5.1, of Spring
 Westfield,=
 =20
 and LB-DE Nick Owino, 6-2, 225, 4.6, of Alief Elsik. UT is one of the
 many=20
 schools in hot pursuit of this talented quartet.
 Owino is the lightning quick DE the Longhorns have been searching for
 ever=20
 since this staff arrived and Jackson is lightning quick, too, and might
 wind=
 =20
 up at DE, too.
 I'm not saying they are Tony Brackens, but they have great potential
 and=20
 could develop into that type of player.
 Both head coach Mack Brown and defensive coordinator Carl Reese have
 been=20
 eager to sign some good speed rushers to play DE, and, after studying tape
 o=
 f=20
 both Owino and Jackson, I think they are just what the Longhorns have
 been=20
 seeking.
 The first Longhorn summer camps will start June 2. Some of the top
 recruits=20
 who plan to make one of the early June camps are DTs Earl Anderson of
 San=20
 Marcos and Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale, Arizona, and  CB Donald Burgs
 of=20
 Houston Madison. Sendlein and Burgs are both strong Longhorn leans and
 might=
 =20
 commit early. Anderson also likes the Longhorns, but has said he
 probably=20
 won't commit early.
 LB Andy Matakis of Corpus Christi Flour Bluff is an interesting recruit.
 He=20
 came to Texas as a heralded player from Pennsylvania, but did not have
 a=20
 great season last year, his first in Texas. But he came from a state
 where=20
 below-the-waist blocking is not allowed in high school, and it will be=20
 interesting to see what he does this year after getting accustomed to
 having=
 =20
 people diving at his knees. He is big and fast at 6-3, 225 and 4.6, and
 migh=
 t=20
 blossom into a big-time prospect.

Brown Says Horns Ready For Big Game; Nordgren Visits Practice

Coach Mack Brown said Thursday the Longhorns "have worked really hard all
week" and appear ready for the big game with Oklahoma in Dallas Saturday.
"It
has been a good week of practice," he said.
Brown also said DT Shaun Rogers (sprained ankle) is still questionable for
the game. He said Rogers will suit up and a decision will be made at game
time. "If we can get 20 plays from Shaun, that would be really good," Brown
said.
LB O. J. McClintock, who missed the OSU game with a bruised knee, appears
to
be completely recovered. He is an outstanding pass defender and probably
will
see a lot of action against the Sooners.
Major Applewhite took most of the snaps with the first team this week and
appears likely to be the starter against Oklahoma. He looked very sharp
last
week against Oklahoma State. He underwent off-season knee surgery, and
Brown
said Applewhite looked "like the old Major" against OSU.
Sophomore TB Kenny Hayter also got a lot work with the first team this week
after rushing for 122 yards against OSU.
* * * *
This game is always a difficult one to figure because strange things happen
a
lot when the Longhorns and Sooners do battle. But I think the Longhorns
will
win if they can avoid getting any punts blocked because the two teams are
comparable in terms of offensive efficiency, but Texas appears to have a
much
better defense.
Oklahoma has outstanding linebackers and a good secondary, but the Sooner
line has not been a great run-stopping unit. The Longhorns should be able
to
run the ball better than the Sooners and that should be the difference in
the
game. Under Mack Brown, the Longhorns are 17-0 when they outrush their
opponents.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: QB Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch visited the Texas
practice Thursday and spend a lot of time after practice talking to Brown
and
offensive coordinator Greg Davis. He was not due to get back into Dallas
until late tonight, but his father said he did not commit to the Horns and
probably will take some more time before making a decision. . . LB/DE
Jonathan Jackson of Galena Park North Shore is being recruited by most
colleges, including UT, as a defensive end. Colleges are wanting DEs with
great speed as outside pass rusher and Jackson ran a 4.56 at a summer camp.
That is very fast for a 6-3, 230-pounder. . . DE Eric Hall of Clarksville,
Tenn., is still a likely future Longhorn. If Texas can corral Jackson and
Hall, that would give them two outstanding speed rushers from the corner if
they both wind up at end. The Longhorns have a great chance to get both of
them.
* * * *
KICKOFF WEATHER FORECAST: If you are going to the game, the Weather Bureau
is
forecasting temperatures in the low 60s with a possible 30% chance of rain
at
11 a.m. Saturday when the game is scheduled to begin. If  rain does occur,
it
is expected to stop in the early afternoon.
* * * *
BASKETBALL RECRUITING NOTES: Two heralded 6-2 stars who are so versatile
that
they have played point guard at times have committed to the Texas women's
basketball team. Kala Bowers of Woodward, Okla., and Jody Bell of Calgary,
Alberta, Canada, both committed to coach Jody Conradt. Bowers is a national
top 25 player who was one of just four high school underclassmen to be
invited to try out for the 2000 junior national team.  She also considered
Colorado, North Carolina, Stanford and Nebraska. She averaged 15.8 points
and
7.4 rebounds last season. Bell averaged 14.5 points and 11.4 rebounds for
Chestermere High School in Calgary. She was a member of the Canadiana
junior
national team. She considered only warm-weather schools and wound up
picking
Texas over Arizona State. Both girls played point guard at times last
season
and both are outstanding ball handlers. Conradt also has commitments from
forward Heather Schreiber, 6-2, of Windthorst, the state's hottest
prospect,
and 5-11 forward CoCo Reed of Houston Jersey Village

Here's your hook em.com fix for the day.....


Backup quarterback
leaving Texas

Associated Press

Posted: April 26, 2000

AUSTIN -- Adam Hall, the Texas Longhorns
backup quarterback during spring drills,
said
he will transfer from the University of
Texas
this fall, coach Mack Brown announced
Wednesday.

"The biggest factor was that I want to
have a
chance to be a starter in the near
future," said
Adam Hall, a redshirt freshman from
Westlake
High School.

The university has released Hall from his

scholarship. Hall plans to complete the
spring
semester then enroll in another
institution in
the fall. The new institution was not
named in
a news release.

"I love all of my teammates and
appreciate
everything the coaches and staff have
done for
me at Texas, but I think I will have a
better
opportunity to play sooner at another
school,"
he said.

Hall completed four of five passes for 85
yards
and a touchdown in Texas' spring game on
April 1. He completed 143 of 263 passes
for
2,188 yards and 21 touchdowns at Westlake

in 1998.

Brown said Hall was a hardworking young
man
on the field and in the classroom. He
wished
the 6-foot-2, 205-pound quarterback luck
at his
next destination.

"Obviously we are very disappointed
because
we felt that Adam had a good spring and
we
have been very pleased with his
progress,"
Brown said.

I'll call you when I get home tonight (around 6).

Love you,
Jenn

True Orange Crystal Ball Shows 2001 Season
Will Be Longhorns' Break-Through Year

My crystal ball was a little faulty last year because it didn't show TE Bo
Scaife going down for the season in the first pre-season practice.
Without that important piece of data, I predicted the Longhorns would win a=
t
least 10 regular season games.
They won nine without Scaife and I think they would have won 10 with him
because the Stanford loss came before the great freshmen wide receivers
became the go-to guys on the team.
I'm more confident this year because the Longhorns are deeper and even more
talented than they were last season, so I'm going to go way out on a limb a=
nd
predict the 2001 season will be remembered as the one we all will recall as
the Horns' "break-through" year.
By that, I mean I think they will break into the top 10 and stay there for
years and years.
Since the Longhorns haven't finished in the top 10 since 1982, that sounds
like a tall order for this team.
This will be coach Mack Brown's fourth team at Texas and it should be his
best one by far.
His fourth recruiting class will enroll in September, and it will be his
third straight great one. that means the first group of great recruits will
be starting their third years. They will be juniors or redshirt sophomores.
The third year normally is one when players who have been able to play at a
high level at times learn how to play at a high level consistently.
This team will have some flaws, but every team has flaws. The great teams
simply have enough great players to win in spite of their flaws.
The Longhorns have offensive weapons that are almost off the chart. With a
healthy Scaife, who is that rarity at TE =01) a swift, sure-handed guy who =
can
turn a six-yard pass into an 80-yard score =01) to go along with
sophomores-to-be Roy Williams and B. J. Johnson, who broke every Longhorn
freshman receiving record last year.
When a team has an awesome tight end, and Scaife is one of those, with
sophomore Brock Edwards not too far behind, it creates match-up problems fo=
r
any defense.
Linebackers normally cover tight ends, and good tight ends, even one who
aren't really fast, usually win those matchups. Fast tight ends who can cat=
ch
in a crowd usually draw coverage from a safety.
But then Williams and Johnson create problems because Williams almost alway=
s
draws double coverage and Johnson is a huge threat to go all the way if one
safety is worrying about Scaife and the other one is helping out on William=
s.
QB Chris Simms seems to be developing into the great player he was expected
to be after all the recruiting services tabbed him as the No. 1 prospect in
the country when he was a senior in high school.
The obvious solution for a defensive coordinator would be to play five or s=
ix
defensive backs most of the time or to go to a zone defense.
But Brown says the Horns will be a better running team than they have been
since Ricky Williams departed, and a more experienced line and a bigger
tailback should make that happen.
Hodges Mitchell was a great little tailback, but this offense is designed
primarily to pass or run between the tackles.
When you want to run between the tackles, it helps to have a big, powerful
tailback.
The tailback this season, whether it is one of the returnees or heralded
recruit Cedric Benson, will be bigger and more powerful than Mitchell.
The line was a good pass-blocking unit last year, and with four of the five
guys back, it should be much better this year.
The only big question about the offense will be one of consistency. When
Simms, who shared time with Major Applewhite last season, was at the helm,
the team often had long, long dry spells.
In the 43-17 victory over Texas A&M, for example, what most people remember
is the Longhorns' four-touchdown explosion in the third quarter.
But I remember being scared silly at the half because the offense had made
only one first down in the entire half and the defense was showing signs of
tiring because of all those 3-and-outs.
And that was not an unusual happening. In the bowl loss to Oregon, Simms to=
ok
the Longhorns on long back-to-back scoring drives in the second quarter, bu=
t
the Horns generated little offense in the first and third quarters.
I could cite other examples, because there are plenty to cite, but Simms is=
 a
year older and wiser and so are the receivers, who performed better last
season than any of us have a right to expect true freshmen to perform.
A bigger, stronger tailback also will be able to pick up more of those
third-and-short downs than the team did last year.
Defensively, eight starters return from an outstanding unit.
The Longhorns lost two great defensive tackles, but the power teams in the
Southern Division of the Big 12 rely a lot more on the pass than they do on
the run, and the tackles UT will play this year are quicker and might suppl=
y
a better pass rush.
Defensive coordinator Carl Reese also made several position changes in the
spring that are certain to generate a better pass rush.
If you remember the Oregon game, the Ducks used quick, undersized linemen t=
o
harass Simms and it worked remarkably well most of the time.
With former DE Maurice Gordon now a super quick DT, and former OLB O. J.
McClintock now a super quick DE, look for the Longhorns to be a much better
pass rushing team in 2001.
I do worry a lot about the Horns' place-kicking, but the coaches are bringi=
ng
in several walk-ons and, hopefully, one of them can kick off into the end
zone and make most of the 40-yard field goals.
Even if the kicking problems aren't solved, this is a team with enough
weapons, offensively and defensively, to be a top 10 team.
No one in the college ranks will be better or deeper at the receiving
positions, particularly when the tight ends are added to the mix, and few
teams will have better defensive secondaries.
The offensive line will be one of the best pass-blocking lines in the Big 1=
2,
and the defensive line, despite having two new tackles, also will be one of
the league's best.
Here's the way I see the Big 12 South race winding up, and, briefly, why I
place each team at its particular spot:
1. Texas - Too many big play guys for the other teams to stop.
2. Oklahoma - Defending national champs could do it again if they can find
another great QB.
3. Texas Tech - Big passing game too tough for everyone in South but Texas
and Oklahoma.
4. Texas A&M - Even R. C. Slocum says the Ags "will not dazzle anyone with
talent."
5. Oklahoma State - Team has too many holes and too tough a schedule to do
any better.
6. Baylor - Bears still find Big 12 a tough row to hoe with little offense
and overworked defense.
Nebraska should win the North, mainly because the Huskers host the big game
with Kansas State.
The Southern Division teams have beaten the North three times in the five
championship games and I think Texas or Oklahoma will make it four this yea=
r.
The  South is a lot stronger than the folks =01) and particularly the pundi=
ts =01)
in the North think, and it's getting stronger every year.

UT Starts Another Great Recruiting Year with First Pledge

The Longhorns have three great recruiting classes in succession, and they
made a good start on a fourth earlier this month when outstanding Brownwood
junior OL Bret Valdez. 6-4, 310, 5.1, confirmed he has committed to the UT
coaches.
Valdez, one of the state's great run blockers, said he went to the UT sprin=
g
game March 31 and really liked what he saw.
He said the Texas coaches offered him a scholarship  at the spring game.
"They told me I was the first offensive lineman they have offered this year=
"
he said, adding that he went home and talked to his parents about it and
decided he wanted to be a Longhorn.
He said he came to Austin the weekend after the spring game and  competed i=
n
the Texas Relays, throwing the shot and discus.
" After I was through competing," he said, "I went over to the coaches'
offices and talked to coach (Mack) Brown and coaches (Tim) Nunez and (Mike)
Tolleson and told them I was ready to commit. I'm really excited about bein=
g
a Longhorn."
He said he also was being recruited by about 20 other schools including
Florida State, Texas A&M, Oklahoma, Alabama and Notre Dame.
"The first time they can come see us is in May and Florida State, A&M, OU,
Notre Dame and Alabama coaches had all told my coach they were going to com=
e
down and see me then."
But he said they need to change their travel plans because he is firmly
committed to the Longhorns and will tell any other coaches who contact him
that he is a future Longhorn.
"Texas has really been recruiting well every year and I think they have a
great shot at winning a national championship in the next year or two," he
said. "I like the way they emphasize academics, too."
"I think I'll have a good chance to start after a redshirt year," he said.
The Longhorns probably will sign only three offensive line prospects next
February, and the coaches have not offered scholarships to any other
offensive line prospects I have been talking to, so they must consider Vald=
ez
to be the state's top OL prospect.
Brownwood went 11-2 last year, and Valdez was the team's top blocker. He ha=
s
thrown the shot 53 feet and discus 162-7.
On tape, Valdez is a very aggressive blocker who has an explosive start tha=
t
allows him to make quick contact and then he simply drives his guy backward=
.
He has the quickest start of any of the big offensive line prospects I have
seen this year.
One of the best things about him is that he is only 16 and won't turn 17
until June 15, but he already benches 320 and squats 600.
* * * *
The Longhorns need a bumper crop of defensive linemen this year, and they
stand a very good chance to get an early commitment from one of the top one=
s
around at their early June camp.
He is Lyle Sendlein, 6-4, 260, 4.8, of Scottsdale Chaparral, a top DT who i=
s
the No. 1 recruit in Arizona.
Sendlein is the son of former UT and NFL LB Robin Sendlein, and he is the
brother of UT redshirt freshman LB Austin Sendlein.
I talked to Sendlein Sunday and he told me he is coming to the June 4
Longhorn camp.
I asked him if he is planning on going to any other camps this summer.
"It depends on what happens at the Texas camp," he said. "I might commit. I
really like Texas."
He said he also is being recruited by Notre Dame, Arizona, UCLA, Arizona
State, USC and "about 15 other schools.
* * * *
Another top DT prospect who is a strong Texas lean is Kasey Studdard, 6-2,
260, 4.8, of Highlands Ranch, Colo.
He is the son of David Studdard, a former UT offensive line star who starte=
d
for the Denver Broncos for about 10 years after his career at Texas.
Studdard told me Sunday he probably isn't going to go to any summer camps,
but he said, "I really like Texas." He said other schools recruiting him
include Colorado, Colorado State, Nebraska, Washington, USC and Missouri.
His sister, Katie, recently accepted a basketball scholarship at Northern
Colorado.
* * * *
DE Larry Dibbles of Lancaster, who has thrown the shot nearly 61 feet, says
he is bigger and also a little bit faster than I have him listed.
"I'm 6-4 1/2, 270 and I run a 4.68 40," he said. He's also an honor student
who carries a 3.6 GPA on a 4.0 scale and has already made a qualifying scor=
e
on the SAT.
"I want to take it again to try to do better, but I've already made a
qualifying score," he said.
When I asked him if he plans to go to any camps this summer, Dibbles said,
"I'm going to the Nike camp at A&M and a Texas camp, probably in late June.=
 I
might go to one more camp, maybe at Oklahoma."
He said Oklahoma, LSU, TCU and SMU have already offered him a scholarship,
and said other schools recruiting him include UT, Notre Dame, A&M, Purdue,
Florida and Nebraska.
When asked what he is looking for in a school, he said, "Academics has to b=
e
first. I want to major in something in the engineering or computer range.
"I also want to know about the graduation rate for football players. The
coaches are important, too, and the chance to get playing time."
He said he went to the Longhorn coaches' offices after competing in the Tex=
as
Relays and met with head coach Mack Brown, DE coach Hardee McCrary and RB
coach Bruce Chambers, who recruits the Lancaster area.
"It was nice in Austin," he said. "I'm pretty interested in Texas."
He also said he thinks Lancaster has a chance to make a good run in the
playoffs this year. "We got to the third round last year and lost to Ennis,=
"
he said. "Ennis won state and we had a lot of young players, so we think we
have a chance to do better this year."
* * * *
Some of the top football players in the state are also some of the top trac=
k
performers.
UT CB signee Michael Huff  won the District 7-5A sprints in 10.69 and 21.68
and anchored the 400-meter relay to victory in 41.32.
Another Longhorn CB recruit, Cedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes, won the
District 27-5A hurdles in 13.75 and 37.76. He also placed fourth in the
triple jump with a 42-3 leap.
There are always a lot of regional qualifier meets between the district and
regional meets and junior RB DaBryan Blanton of Forney had some great times
at the one in Glen Rose Friday, running a 10.1 100 meters and 20.7 200
meters. UT WR recruit Quan Cosby of Mart was second in both races, running
10.5 and 21.18.
Junior RB/CB Edorian McCullough of North Garland, who is undefeated in the
dashes this year, ran 10.36 and 20.89 and anchored his 400-meter relay team
to a win in 41.07 in a regional qualifer meet in Mansfield. Huff was second
in the 200 in 21.54 and third in the 100 in 10.55.
UT LB recruit Derrick Johnson ran a 10.79 for third place in the 100 in a
regional qualifiers meet in McGregor. He has run a 10.6 this year.

Part 2

The Bowl Outlook

The Longhorns' victory over the Aggies assured them a spot in a major bowl
game.
It probably will be the Holiday Bowl in San Diego on against Pacific Coast
tri-champion Oregon State, a very good 10-1 team.
But it could be the Cotton Bowl for a third straight year against an SEC
power.
Let's look at the Big 12 Conference's bowl setup:
1. Champion gets an automatic BCS bowl bid.
a. If OU loses to Kansas State, the Sooners might get a BCS at-large bowl
bid.
2. Cotton Bowl, Jan. 1, payout $2.5 million, picks first after BCS bowls fi=
ll
up. 10 a.m. Fox
3. Holiday Bowl, Dec. 29, payout $1.9 million, gets second pick. 7:30 p.m.
ESPN
4. Alamo Bowl in San Antonio, Dec. 30, payout $1.2 million, comes  next. 7
p.m. ESPN
5. Insight.com Bowl in Tucson, Dec. 28, payout $750,000, gets the next bid.
6:30 p.m. ESPN
6. Independence Bowl in Shreveport, Dec. 30, payout $1.1 million. 7 p.m. ES=
PN
7. Galleryfurniture.com Bowl in Houston, Dec. 27, payout $750,000, comes la=
st
in the Big 12 pecking order. 7 p.m. ESPN-2
The bowl bids won't go out until after the Big 12 title game this weekend,
but Kansas State probably needs to beat Oklahoma and win the automatic BCS
berth to avoid falling to the lower-ranking bowls on the Big 12 list.
K-State coach Bill Snyder is outstanding at winning games, but is not popul=
ar
with the bowl committee members because they feel he is a very reluctant
participant in the pre-bowl festivities.
So, the Wildcats probably won't affect the Longhorns' bowl hopes because th=
ey
will either beat Oklahoma and get an automatic BCS bid or the will lose to
the Sooners and be picked for a bowl bid after the Longhorns are already se=
t.
I think Oklahoma will get a BCS bid, even if the Sooners lose to K-State
Saturday. In that case, the Sooners wouldn't affect the Longhorns' bowl
prospects either.
That leaves the bowls with Big 12 ties looking like this after the BCS pick=
s:
Cotton Bowl - Nebraska (9-2) or Texas (9-2) vs. SEC team, probably Tennesse=
e
(8-3)
Holiday Bowl - Texas (9-2) or Nebraska (9-2) vs. Oregon State (10-1)
Alamo Bowl -  probably Texas A&M (7-4) or Kansas State (10-2) vs.
Northwestern (8-3)
Insight.com Bowl - A&M (7-4) or Kansas State (10-2) vs. Big East team
Independence Bowl - Iowa State (8-3) vs. SEC team
Galleryfurniture.com Bowl - Texas Tech (7-5) vs. East Carolina (7-4)
I'm pulling for Texas to wind up in the Cotton Bowl game again because I'd
like for the Horns to win their last game this season and I think Tennessee
is a better matchup for UT than Oregon State.

UT Women Win Tourney

Senior guard JoRuth Woods scored 19 points to lead the Texas women's
basketball team to a 78-74 over Denver late Sunday night in Cancun, Mexico,
in the championship game of the Torneo Cancun de Basquetbol.
Woods was the tourney MVP and was joined on the All-Tournament Team by 6-2
freshman forward Annissa Hastings, who came off the bench to score a
career-high 16 points to lead Texas to a 73-59 win over Louisville in the
first round of the tourney Saturday night.
Texas hit 23 of 33 free throws, including a six for eight performance  in t=
he
final 30 seconds to ice the championship game.
The Longhorns are 5-1 and off to their best start since the 1996-97 season.
Coach Jody Conradt said she is "very pleased" with the way her young team i=
s
improving.

Recruiting Roundup

Let's get the bad news out of the way first, because there is a lot of good
news to brighten the overall picture.
The bad news is that the Horns really have an uphill fight in their bid to
sign the state's top recruit =01) DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison.
Oklahoma has the inside track now, and the Sooners will have to stumble on
the field or in their  recruiting of Harris to give the Horns a chance to g=
et
back in the race.
* * * *
Nearly all of the 19 recruits who have already committed to Texas have chos=
en
plan to take their official visits the Dec. 15 weekend, and so have most of
the players the Longhorns are still recruiting.
That is the weekend of the annual football banquet and the only Longhorn
pledges who won't be taking official visits that weekend are DE Eric Hall o=
f
Clarksville, Tenn., who took his official visit earlier, and possibly playe=
rs
like RB Cedric Benson of Midland Lee and QB-Athlete Kendal Briles of
Wollforth Frenship, because they play on teams that might be still alive in
the state playoffs in mid-December.
Benson, last year's Class 5A Offensive Player of the Year, had 19 carries f=
or
201 yards and three touchdowns on runs of 26, 52 and 11 yards in a 45-14
thumping of El Paso Franklin in the state playoffs last weekend. He also
scored on a 52-yard screen pass.
Briles, last year's Class 4A Offensive Player of the year, completed 15 of =
20
passes for 230 yards and five touchdowns in a 61-6 romp past El Paso Ysleta=
.
Briles, who led Stephenville to the state 4A title last year, has thrown fo=
r
more than 3,000 yards and 30 touchdown and has run for more than 800 yards
and 12 more TDs so far this season.
Despite rumors galore to the contrary, both Benson and Briles said they
remain solidly committed to Texas.
* * * *
With 19 scholarships already committed, Texas will give only five to seven
more this season. They could go as high as seven because they can count
punter Brian Bradford of Trinity Valley JC, who will enroll in January,
against last year.
The best players still available who list the Longhorns No. 1 are LB Derric=
k
Johnson of Waco, DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia, Cal.; TE James Moses and DE
Jonathan Jackson, both of Galena Park North Shore; OL William Winston of
Houston Madison, safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple, athlete Quan Cosby of Ma=
rt
and DT Paul Broussard of Blinn JC.
Most of the remaining six or seven scholarships will go to the players in
that group.
DT Marquise Hill, 6-6, 300, 5.0, of New Orleans De La Salle, and DE Justin
Tomerlin, 6-7, 260, of San Clemente, Cal., are a couple of outstanding
prospects who might visit Texas, but they are the longest of long shots rig=
ht
now.
* * * *
Top recruits who came to the A&M game were DTs Harris and Broussard, and
Longhorn commitments OLs Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter, Mike Garcia of
Galena Park and Terrance Young of Longview, LBs Yamil Lebron of Killeen
Ellison and Lance McFarland of Jefferson and RB Anthony Johnson of Jefferso=
n.
Two top junior prospects also were on hand =01) OL Kyle Thornton, 6-5, 300,=
 5.2,
of Dallas St. Mark's and WR Anthony Wright, 6-3, 200, 4.5, of Klein Forest.
Thornton is the younger brother of Longhorn freshman DE starter Kalen
Thornton.
Aggie Injury Excuses Hollow
The Aggies players and coaches did a lost of post-game moaning about their
injury problems.
For the second straight year, Texas was missing starting QB Major Applewhit=
e
against A&M and the Horns also were down to a backup FB, Chad Stevens,
playing TE because all three scholarship TEs were injured.
Two top DT reserves, Stevie Lee and Ryan Haywood, were lost for the season,
starting safety Lee Jackson and super DT Shaun Rogers have missed a lot of
time with injuries and redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis, the guy who was
counted on to give those super freshmen some time to mature, had been out
nearly all year with a sore shin.
Then you have OL like Derrick Dockery and Antwan Kirk-Hughes who have been
battle sickness and/or injuries all year.
The point is that every team has injuries, and Texas has had more of them
this season than Texas A&M.

Basketball Team 3-1

Texas took a big early lead over  Indiana  Friday night and then held off a
Hoosier comeback for a 70-58 victory in the consolation game of the Tivo
Preseason NIT in New York City.
The Longhorns (3-1) started three freshmen - James Thomas, Brandon Mouton a=
nd
Royal Ivey - and used a stifling defense to take a 42-22 lead at halftime.
Indiana (2-2) climbed back into the game and cut the lead to seven points a=
t
49-42, limiting Texas to just two baskets in the first 8:52 of the second
half.
Then Thomas scored five straight points as Texas restored a comfortable lea=
d
with a 13-0 run.
Mouton and Maurice Evans opened the game with consecutive 3-pointers, and t=
he
Texas defensive pressure forced a lot of turnovers.
Chis Owens had 12 points in the first half and led Texas with 15 points and
14 rebounds.
Texas had fallen to top-ranked Duke, 95-69 Wednesday in the tourney
semifinals. Mouton led Texas with 18 points and Evans had 17.

Baseball Team Adds Four

Baseball coach Augie Garrido has signed third baseman Nic Crosta of Seattle=
,
Wash, right-handed pitchers Chris Scofield of Fort Worth Nolan and Danny
Muegge of Blinn JC and centerfielder Dustin Majewski of Blinn JC.to round o=
ut
the Longhorns' early signing class  for the 2001-02 campaign.
"With their potential both offensively and defensively, thse players are
solid additions to our early signing class that will  provide us with depth=
,"
said Texas assistant coach and  recruiting coordinator Tommy Harmon.
"Overall, we are very pleased  with the student-athletes we have signed for
the 2001-02 season."
An honor student at Nolan Catholic High School, Scofield earned  All-State
honors to go along with All-Area distinctions in 2000 as he  helped the
Vikings capture their district championship and finish  second in the state
finals.  He was also named his team's MVP last  season and was a teammate o=
f
current Longhorn freshman pitcher Tim  McGough at Nolan.
Crosta is a three-year varsity letterman, a three-time All-Seamount League
selection and two-time team MVP for Highline High School in Seattle, Wash.
An honor student, Crosta posted a league-leading .551 batting average last
season to go along with conference-best numbers in RBI (31) and home runs (=
8)
to win the Seamount League's Triple Crown and earn South County Journal
All-Area accolades.
He was also named the Everett Wood Bat Classic MVP and to an All-Tournament
team in Reno, Nev., this past summer.
Majewski hit .385 and blasted 16 homers at Blinn last season. Muegge played
last season at McLennan JC in Waco, and is playing for Blinn this season. H=
e
has a very good changeup and a fast ball in the 88-90 mph range.

Reese Signs Top Prospects

Texas swimming coach Eddie Reese and diving coach Matt Scoggin have signed
three top recruits.
They are swimmers Andrew Davidson of Father Ryan HS in Nashvill and Rainer
Kendrick of Homewood HS in Birminghamm and diver Jonathan Linette of Fort
Lauderdale, Fla.
Davidson, a four-time high school All-American and 1999 Southeastern
Conference Swimmer of the Year, is the defending Tennessee state champion i=
n
the 100 butterfly and 100-yard backstroke.
He also won the 1999 Junior National Championship in the 200 backstroke and
qualified for the Olympic Trials in the 100 and 200 backstroke.
Kendrick is a four-time All-State honoree and two-time South Eastern Swimme=
r
of the Year.
At the 1999 American Short Course Championships, he placed first in both th=
e
200 and the 400  individual medley events, while also finishing runner-up i=
n
the 100 freestyle and 200 butterfly.
Linette won back-to-back Junior National Titles (1998 and 1999) on the
10-meter platform, and also captured the bronze medal at the 2000 Junior
World Championships in the platform event. She posted a 12th-place finish
(885.93) on the platform at the U. S. Olympic Trials.
"We are extremely pleased in this group," said Reese. "They are very talent=
ed
and are definitely strong in each of their events, which will help solidify
and add versatility to our roster."

Women's Golf Inks Pair

Texas women's golf coach Susan Watkins has signed Lisa Ferrero of Lodi, Cal=

Hey Baby,

Sorry that I haven't been able to email you yet.  It's been a busy day
already.  My presentation went well this morning (at least my part
did).  I'm meeting with Jen Garcia to work on our project again today.
I should be home before 7 unless Jen and I have some good things going.
When I get home, I have a exam to study for.

About grad. dinner- I called the other Mezzaluna and they're booked
also.  Bren called her mom for suggestions and she named about 8
different restaurants.  So, hopefully some of them will have room!  I'll
tell you which ones they are when I get home.  PLEASE remind me about
the invitations!  I've got to send them out soon.  I'm sending mine to
your parents, Bren's parents, Tom & Jeanette, and the Denneys.  Anybody
else?

I'm really hungry so I'm going to eat my pb&j sandwich soon!  (Yeah,
food!)  I'm so weak (or is it tired?) that I can't see very well.

Seeing you soon is what keeps me going!

Love you,
Jenn

 Longhorns Favored by 42 in Season Opener,
But New Mexico State Will Test Run Defense

Coach Mack Brown and the Longhorn players hope they are back among the
nation's elite teams, but they won't find out Saturday night when they
entertain the 42-point underdog New Mexico State Aggies.
The 6 p.m. game will be televised nationally by Fox, and the sellout crowd
and all those television viewers should see a Longhorn romp, and they also
will find out those new defensive tackles are shaping up.
Texas led the Big 12 Conference in rushing defense last year, allowing only
93.4 yards a game and 2.6 yards a carry.
New Mexico State won only three games last year and the Aggies started this
season on a losing note, falling to Louisville, 45-24.
But they outgained the Cardinals, 544-373, and lost primarily because they
fumbled twice deep in Louisville territory and both fumbles were returned for
Cardinal touchdeowns.
RB Kenton Keith, who rushed for 849 yards last season, had 22 carries for 137
yards and led the Aggies to a 24-23 halftime lead before the two long fumble
returns turned the game around in the second half.
The Aggies were No. 7 in the country in rushing last year and the year before
with their power-option attack, and they will give those new Longhorn defense
tackles an early test.
QB K. C. Enzminger also can run. He picked up 450 yards rushing last season
while passing for 1,457 more yards and 15 touchdowns.
The New Mexico State defense gives up lots of yards and lots of points when
it is on the field, but the Aggie offense, when it gets rolling like it did
in the first half at Louisville, can control the ball for long periods in the
game.
Sophomore Marcus Tubbs and the other young defensive tackles will bear a
major responsibility in handling the Aggie inside option.
They have looked good in practice, but facing an option attack is such a
rarity these days that it's difficult to practice for it.
Most of the top teams the Longhorns will play this year are pass-first,
run-second teams. In fact, some of them are pass-first, pass-second and
pass-third team who hardly ever run.
That's what makes this game so interesting, even if it should be a blowout,
because the one thing New Mexico State does well is run the football.
But that's enough on the opponents. Let's look at the Longhorns, their No. 5
national ranking, and their chances of keeping it.
No one in college football will have a receiving corps to match the
Longhorns, particularly when the wide receivers and tight ends are lumped
together.
The top three wide receivers and top two tight ends, all sophomores by the
way, are outstanding.
Few teams in college football have a defensive secondary to equal UT's, and
there probably isn't a better pass-blocking offensive line in the Big 12.
The defensive line lost outstanding tackles Casey Hampton, an All-American,
and Shaun Rogers, but it should again be very good with DEs Cory Redding and
Kalen Thornton leading the way.
Redding, a junior, and Thornton, a sophomore, both started and played very
well as true freshmen. Both are bigger and stronger this season, and look
ready to have outstanding seasons.
Tubbs played a lot last year as a redshirt freshman because Rogers had a
badly sprained ankle that limited his play for much of the year.
He played well then and has looked like a budding star in two-a-days.
The coaches say they are worried about the other defensive tackle position,
but good coaches always say they are worried unless their names are Steve
Spurrier or Bob Stoops.
But redshirt freshman Stevie Lee has been looking very good against the run
in recent practices, and senior Maurice Gordon is an outstanding pass rusher
who also plays the run pretty well.
Sophomore Adam Doiron, who is a good run stopper, also figures to see a lot
of playing time.
The offensive line has been working harder this spring on run blocking
because head coach Mack Brown says the Longhorns "have to be able to run the
ball when we want to run it."
He says a dependable running game makes it harder to stop the Horns' lethal
passing weapons, helps in running the clock when protecting a lead, and last
but not least, helps the defense by giving it more time to rest.
One constant in the Longhorns' three losses last season was the incredible
number of three-and-out possessions by the offense.
Against Oklahoma, for example, Texas had one first down when the Sooners
scored their sixth touchdown.
Even in the big victory over A&M, the Longhorns had just one first down in
the entire first half, and the stout UT defense obviously tired in the third
quarter, but it didn't matter because Texas scored four touchdowns in the
period to blow the game open.
That shouldn't happen this season. The line has worked harder on run
blocking, and the four returning line starters finally have enough experience
to function better as a unit.
It also shouldn't happen because the running back corps looks so much
stronger than it was last year when it started and ended with Hodges Mitchell.
Junior Victor Ike, one of the fastest backs around, is bigger and stronger
and determined to hold the starting job.
But 245-pound sophomore Ivan Williams, always a terror in the spring and a
bust in the fall, must be smelling spring flowers because he has been a
terror throughout two-a-day workouts.
And then there is true freshman Cedric Benson. I know now how Florida fans
must have felt when they first set eyes on Emmitt Smith. This young man is
something special.
He's lightning-quick to the line, and he has such great vision that he always
seems to find the soft spot. He also is hard to bring down.
In other words, he has a lot of the same assets that made guys like Ricky
Williams, Earl Campbell and Roosevelt Leaks such great Longhorn backs.
Williams and Campbell both won the Heisman Trophy and Leaks would have if he
hadn't suffered a devastating knee injury after finishing third in the
Heisman voting as a junior.
Ike will start Saturday night, but look for Williams and Benson to get a lot
of carries, too.
The coaches say QB Chris Simms, FB Matt Trissel and the linebackers are all
much improved over last season. Let's hope they are right.
That doesn't leave much except kicking and special teams, and those could be
problems this season.
Junior college transfer Brian Bradford has won the punting job and he always
gets great height and usually gets great length. I'd rather have the height,
because line-drive punts often lead to long returns.
As long as he doesn't get any blocked, the Horns should be fine in the
punting game.
Freshman walk-on Dusty Mangum of Mesquite has won the place-kicking job, and
he has been very accurate in practice up to 40 yards.
But if you watched Oklahoma Saturday, the Sooners didn't look as potent on
offense as last year, but they had a killer kicking game to go along with a
killer defense.
The Horns should have a good punting game and they probably will have pretty
good success in kicking field goals and kicking off.
But they had better dominate in other areas when they play teams that have
kicking games like Oklahoma or they will be in trouble.
Bobby Bowden has won two national titles at Florida State, and he would have
won twice that many if he had a kicker like Phil Dawson or Kris Stockton.
Remember "wide right" and those chip-shot misses that cost him two perfect
seasons?
Mangum could be a good kicker. He's a remarkable find for a walk-on, but
making kicks like Dawson and Stockton made is a lot to ask from any walk-on.
Brown plans to announce his starting lineups later today, but there is little
suspense with 17 starters returning and replacements already in place at most
of the other spots.
When you carry a No. 5 national ranking into the season, you obviously have a
lot going for you.
That is the case with the Longhorns, but they have some areas where
improvement is mandatory if they want to keep that lofty spot and possibly
improve upon it.
Junior QB Chris Simms led the Big 12 in passing efficiency last year, but he
also had a problem with interceptions.
The Longhorns couldn't run the ball when they had to in the big games they
lost last year.
What are the chances for improvements in those two areas?
Simms has looked better during the pre-season at throwing the ball away
instead of forcing it into a crowd. If he can improve his
touchdowns-to-interceptions ratio to 2-to-1 or even 3-to-1, this should be a
great season.
The increased emphasis on the running game and the bigger backs and the quick
way Benson has adapted to the college game will improve the  team in that
area.
The key here will be for the line to open more holes.
Defensively, the loss of the two tackles is the big problem and Tubbs and the
other three players mentioned earlier should be able to fill those holes.
Against passing teams, they probably will be better than last year's tackles
because Rogers was never completely healthy after the ankle sprain in the
Houston game and and Hampton was more of a run stopper than a pass rusher.
So, if Simms can be more consistent in big games, if the offensive line can
block better for the run and if the kicking game holds up, this Longhorn team
has a chance to be in the Rose Bowl playing for the national title in January.
But breakdowns in any of those areas could again break Longhorn hearts and
dreams.
If you want to know how I think it will all come out, I'm going to chicken
out. I think the Longhorns are going to be a top 10 team for sure, and I
think they have a chance to make it to the Rose Bowl.
But so do several other teams, including three or four others in the Big 12.
Texas will have to go 11-0 and beat Oklahoma to win the Big 12 South, then
topple Nebraska or Kansas State or whoever emerges in the North to make it to
Pasadena.
There are lots of other teams out there who also have legitimate shots at the
Rose Bowl, including Oklahoma, Nebraska, Kansas State, Florida, Miami and
Oregon, the Longhorns' conqueror in the Holiday Bowl.
Oklahoma was rated No. 19 at this time last year and the Sooners won the
national title, going 13-0 in the process and beating Kansas State twice.
A similar scenario could play out this year. The Longhorns have to take care
of business better than they have in a long time to make it to Pasadena.
But two teams will get there, and one of them could be the Longhorns. That's
what makes this season so interesting for all orange-blooded football fans.
The game this week won't answer many questions, but it will show us with of
the problem areas has improved and which of them are still problems.
All teams have some problems. The ones with the fewest usually wind up
playing for all the marbles.
Let's hope the Longhorns are problem solvers deluxe this season.

Part 3 of 3

Offensive Line Coach Interview

Offensive line coach Tim Nunez says he went into spring football with twin
goals of developing better run blockers and finding a left tackle to replac=
e
All-American Leonard Davis, who was the second player chosen in the first
round of the NFL draft Saturday.
In an interview last week, he told me he is pleased about the progress his
players made in both areas.
He said right tackle Mike Williams and right guard Derrick Dockery were
outstanding this spring in every area, including run blocking.
"Mike Williams had a great spring," Nunez said. "He had as good a spring as
any offensive linemen has had since we've been here. He's really light on h=
is
feet for such a big man, and that helps him, whether he's pass blocking or
run blocking.
"Derrick Dockery finally was healthy this spring," he said. "That infection
he had last season really sapped his strength all season. He fought through
it and played as hard as he could, but this spring he was flying around and
doing things he couldn't do last year. He was just a different guy this
spring and he really did a good job. He and Mike really gave us a strong
right side this spring."
He said center Matt Anderson "played well this spring. He's a steady hand i=
n
there." He also said backup Jason Glynn "had a very good spring. He is real=
ly
athletic. We just need to get him some snaps."
Junior Robbie Doane started at left tackle all spring and Nunez said, "I
think Robbie Doane is going to be a good football player for us. He needs t=
o
have a great summer and get stronger in his upper body. He really wants to =
be
a good player and he'll work hard this summer to get there."
He said Doane "has great technique. He really knows what to do. He's just g=
ot
to get strong enough to do it on a consistent basis."
Nunez said one reason Doane might not have been an obvious standout during
the spring "was that he was going against a great player. (Defensive end)
Kalen Thornton is as hard to block as anybody he'll see during the season.
He's special."
But the Longhorns also have some other options at left tackle. Blinn Junior
College star Alfio Randall has passed the JC exit exam and is on schedule t=
o
graduate in time to join the team in August, and Dockery also worked some a=
t
left tackle in the spring and did very well, Nunez said.
Two top guards missed the spring. Senior Antwan Kirk-Hughes, a two year
starter, was recovering from shoulder surgery and sophomore Tillman Hollowa=
y
sprained a knee early in the spring and missed the remainder of the drills.
When they return, Nunez said it will make it easier to move Dockery to tack=
le
if the need arises. He said both of them should be totally recovered in
plenty of time for the season.
How about depth at guard if Dockery moves to tackle?
"Bo Baker had a good spring at guard," he said. "We'll continue to work him
some at center, but he gives us another good guard. He's really fast. If we
had a race, he would be the fastest of the offensive linemen."
Nunez said players like Williams, Dockery and Kirk-Hughes have had to play
earlier than they should have, since none of them redshirted, but he said
those painful early learning experiences should pay off this year.
"Mike Williams really improved during last season," Nunez said. "He was
playing really well by the end of the season, and he carried that over into
this spring."
He said Kirk-Hughes' shoulder and Dockery's infection hampered their play
last season, but he said they played as hard as they could and should be mu=
ch
better this season because of their experiences last season.
Dockery made great strides this spring, he said, adding that he expects
Kirk-Hughes to again be one of the team's top linemen when he returns with
his surgically-repaired shoulder.
Holloway started several games as a redshirt freshman last year due to
Dockery's health problems, and Nunez said he "had to grow up during the
season. It's tough to start as a redshirt freshman offensive lineman in thi=
s
league, but he worked through it and he was just playing so much better by
the end of the season."
"I'm excited about this group," Nunez said. "They've worked hard to get
better and I think they have a chance to be a really strong group this seas=
on
if they can stay healthy."
Head coach Mack Brown said at the end of spring practice the Longhorns were
running the ball better than they have the last two seasons. Since he also
says he isn't that happy with any of the tailbacks, he obviously feels the
line is doing a better job of run blocking.
"We worked on it more this spring," Nunez said, "and I think that will pay
off this season."
One thing that needs to be noted is that the perennial powerhouse teams
usually don't start offensive linemen until they are redshirt juniors, whic=
h
means they are in their fourth year.
Exceptional linemen can start earlier, but even they usually spend two year=
s
backing up before starting in their third year.
This coaching staff inherited some talent when it took over, but other than=
 a
talented bunch of seniors, the offensive line talent was pretty bare.
Even first-round draft choice Davis spent his first year on defense before
the new staff switched him to the offensive line.
Texas should be able to begin redshirting most of its offensive linemen thi=
s
season, but the coaches haven't had that luxury until now.
Why? Because, despite their great overall recruiting success, they have bee=
n
able to sign only three offensive linemen each year until they hit the
jackpot with six in their last recruiting class.

Kelly Named Basketball MVP

Senior shooting guard Darren Kelly was chosen the Texas basketball team's
Most Valuable Player by his teammates to highlight the team's banquet.
Kelly, who earned USBWA All-District 7 and NABC/Chevrolet All-District 9
second-team honors and third-team All-Big 12 Conference mention, led the te=
am
in assists (76) and minutes (34.6 mpg) and ranked second in scoring (15.3
ppg) and fourth inrebounding (4.6 rpg) and steals (32).
Freshman center Brian Boddicker won the Most Improved Player award.  A Big =
12
All-Freshman team selection, Boddicker averaged 5.7 points and 3.9 rebounds
in 19.6 minutes per contest.
Senior walk-on guard Yair Harari was named the winner of the Jack Gray Awar=
d,
presented in recognition of outstanding character, citizenship, academic
achievement and contributions reflective of the Texas basketball program.

Basketball Aide Moves Up
Rob Lanier, 32, the Longhorns' top assistant basketball coach and lead
recruiter for the last two years, was named head coach at Siena College in
Loudonville, N.Y., last week
UT head coach Rick Barnes  said he will  try to hire a new assistant soon,
adding that he plans to hire another bright young coach who is on his way u=
p
the coaching ladder.
Six of Barnes' former assistants have become college head coaches and that =
is
because he always hires a bright, young assistant on the way up who also
happens to be an outstanding recruiter.
Lanier recruited several outstanding prospects for the Longhorns, including
most of last season's top freshmen and incoming point guard recruit T. J.
Ford.

Recruiting Roundup

As a general rule, blue-chip recruits are scarce at 11:30 a.m. Longhorn
games, but Saturday's 59-0 rout over Kansas was an exceptional day for top
recruits to turn out.
For starters, three top linebackers took their official visits to Texas. They
are Michael Williams, 6-3, 220, 4.6, of Lindale; A. J. Nicholson, 6-2, 230,
4.5, of Mount Tabor HS in Winston Salem, N. C., and Rufus Alexander, 6-1,
210, 4.5, of Baton Rouge Christian Life.
Texas needs to sign several linebackers this year. All three starters are
seniors and their backups are mostly unproven.
Williams and Alexander are speedy outside linebacker types who are top
national recruits, and Nicholson is one of the top inside backers in the
nation.
I talked to all three of them after they returned home from their visits, and
Williams, who has visited Texas, Oklahoma, Texas Tech and Texas A&M, said he
has pretty well narrowed his choices to the Longhorns and Sooners.
He said he had a great time in Austin "and I really like the players and
coaches."
Nicholson said Texas is his top choice right now, but he said he plans to
visit Miami and Florida State before making a decision.
"I thought the facilities at Texas were incredible," he said, "and I really
liked the coaches and players and everybody I met.
Alexander said Texas is one of his top choices. "The players and coaches
really get along together," he said. "It's like a big family."
He said Texas and Alabama are his top two teams right now, and he said he
will visit Alabama, Florida and Tennessee before making a decision.
Eleven recruits off my 25-man "difference-maker" list were at the game. They
are QB Vincent Young of Houston Madison, RB Albert Hardy of Galena Park, LB
Marvin Byrdsong of Longview, TE Eric Winston of Midland Lee, WR Robert
Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus, RB Paul Mosley of Austin Anderson, Athlete
DaBryan Blanton of Forney and UT commitments DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos,
LBs Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar and Brian Robison of Splendora and OL
Brett Valdez of Brownwood.
Other top recruits at the game included DE Chase Pittman of Shreveport
Evangel, a UT commitment and a national top 100 player; WR Anthony Wright of
Klein Forest and WR Dustin Miksch of Round Rock Westwood, a UT pledge.
Two top juniors who were there were QB Kris Heavner, 6-3, 200, 4.7, of
Johnson City, and WR/DB Limas Sweed, 6-4, 190, 4.5, of Brenham.
The Longhorns still have 16 commitments. Garnet Smith has firmed up his
commitment and has stopped talking to the press, on orders from his father.
Of the kids who came to the game other than the three who were on official
visits and who have already been discussed, I think Texas has at least a
50-50 shot with Young, Hardy, Winston and Timmons.
The Longhorns will sign between 25 and 27 players in February and most of the
remaining 9-to-11 scholarships will go to recruits in an 18-member group that
includes Young, Hardy, Winston, OLs Justin Blalock of Plano East and Tony
Ugoh of Spring Westfield, DT/OG Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch, Colo.; DEs
Bryan Pickryl of Jenks, Okla., Larry Dibbles of Lancaster and Travis Leitko
of The Woodlands, DTs Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings and Marco Martin of
Mesquite; LBs Williams, Nicholson, Alexander and Aaron Harris of North
Mesquite, and one of three WRS - Timmons, Wright or Biren Ealy of Cypress
Falls.
The Longhorns also are looking for a kicker who can boot the ball into the
end zone consistently and will sign one if they can one who meets their
needs. Of course, they probably will try to talk him into walking on first,
but they'll probably come up with a scholarship if they find a great one.

Horns Fifth in Both Polls

Texas remained No. 5 in both major football polls this week.
The Associated Press poll has Miami No. 1, Nebraska No. 2, Oklahoma No. 3 and
Florida No. 4, while the USA Today/ESPN poll has Nebraska No. 1, Miami No. 2,
Florida No. 3 and OU No. 4.



Great Sprinter Commits to UT

UT track coach Bubba Thornton is going to sign a great bunch of runners when
the early national signing period begins Wednesday.
The top recruit is Brendan Christian, an awesome sprinter at Austin Reagan,
who is one of the top two or three prospects in the nation.
Christian won the Class 4A 200 meter title in a Class 4A state record fully
automatic time of 20.56 as a junior.
He didn't run the 100 at the state meet because he anchored Reagan's 400 and
1,600 relay teams and UIL rules allow participation in only three running
events for each individual.
He  anchored Reagan to second place in the 1,600 relay. He has run anchor
legs in the 45.5 range on the 1,600 relay.
Christian also won the National AAU 100 meter title in his age group in a
fully automatic time of 10.3.
He is a senior this year  and says he is hoping to lower his state record in
the 200 before heading to Texas for his college career. He also said he wants
to run more 100 meters races.
Thornton also has commitments from several other top sprinters and I'll have
a full story on it in my next  issue after they have signed their letters of
intent.

Horns Get Exhibition Win

Sophomore forward Brian Boddicker had 21 points and  seven rebounds to lead
No. 23 Texas to a 122-72 victory against Alaska Anchorage in the Longhorns'
exhibition opener Wednesday in the Erwin center.
 Sophomore swingman Brandon Mouton and sophomore guard Royal Ivey both scored
18 points. Senior forward Chris Owens had 13 points, six rebounds and two
blocks in just 12 minutes of action.
Sophomore forward James Thomas had 12 points and six rebounds, while
fredshirt reshman center Jason Klotz added 11 points and a team-high nine
boards.
"I thought we were a little sloppy tonight," coach Rick Barnes said.
"Defensively, we looked good. We did force some turnovers (29) and
capitalized on them (40 points off turnovers). The effort and intensity they
showed tonight was what we were looking for."
Freshman T.J. Ford started alongside senior Fredie Williams in the Texas
backcourt, and their defensive pressure caused problems for the Seawolves
throughout the game.
Ford finished with 12 assists against only two turnovers and a game-high six
steals, while Williams added three thefts of his own.
UT kicks off the 2001-02 regular season with a home game versus national
power Arizona Saturday at 7 p.m. in the Erwin Center.

Youngsters Lead Women

Sophomore forward Stacy Stephens and freshman forward Heather Schreiber
combined to score 28 points and pull down 29 rebounds to lead the Texas
women's basketball team to an 80-67 win over Aabyhoej of Denmark in
exhibition game action Thursday night at the Erwin Center.
Led by Stephens, Schreiber, sophomore guard Kaira White with 14 points and
senior forward Tracy Cook, who added 11 points and seven boards, Texas
completely dominated inside play.
The Horns outscored the Danish squad by a 52-12 margin in the paint. The
Horns also controlled the boards, out-rebounding the visitors by a convincing
57-32 edge. Aabyhoej is the reigning Danish National Champion.
This was the second and final exhibition game of the preseason for the
Longhorns, who defeated the Australia Institute of Sport,71-64, in their
other exhibition contest on November 1.
Texas returns to action on Tuesday, Nov. 20 when the Longhorns open the
regular season against BYU at 7 p.m. at the Erwin Center.
"We still have lots of work to do, and we just made some mental errors, kept
fouling and we put them on the free throw way too much," said head coach Jody
Conradt. "We certainly ran the ball well and got some great looks, but didn't
finish our plays on the offensive end, and that's a concern."

The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful

Volume 11, No. 17, May 14, 2001

Brown Says Longhorns Should Be Very Good
Offensively with Chance for Stout Defense, Too

Coach Mack Brown says the Longhorns will head into the football season with
just one problem on offense and fewer than expected on defense if his young
tackles come through.
In an interview with coach Brown last week, I asked him how the Longhorns
compare with his best teams at North Carolina.
In a nutshell, he said Texas is better offensively than those North Carolin=
a
teams, but is not quite as imposing defensively
His last two teams at North Carolina lost only to Florida State, posting th=
e
best two-year record ever for the Tar Heels, and finishing in the top 10
twice, something Texas hasn't accomplished once in nearly two decades.
"Our offensive line is better here," he said. "We have two quarterbacks who
can play. We had that at North Carolina, too, but our upside is better here=
.
Our receivers at North Carolina were very good, but the ones we have now ca=
n
be the best we've had."
He said North Carolina's fullback and tight end  from his last team there a=
re
still playing in the NFL, but he also noted that UT TE's Bo Scaife and Broc=
k
Edwards, who are only sophomores in eligibility, have NFL potential, too.
He said one big plus offensively at UT is the depth the incoming freshmen
will provide in the line.
"We had good offensive linemen at North Carolina, but we had trouble findin=
g
good ones in numbers," he said.
"We didn't have good numbers here and had to force some guys to play too
early," he said, "but that got them ready to play and now we have  good
experience and good numbers and we hope we can start redshirting our freshm=
en
offensive linemen. We need to get to that point."
Hesaid the only problem he sees offensively this season is at tailback, and
that isn't as big a problem as it seems because all five of the returnees
competing for the job are competent players and several of them have the
ability to step it up.
And if they don't step it up, there is a young fellow coming to two-a-days =
in
August who has everyone excited. I've written enough about Cedric Benson th=
at
I won't go through it all again, but he is something special.
If you doubt it, just remember this: Three state championship games in Clas=
s
5A at Midland Lee, with five touchdowns in each game. No one else has ever
come close to doing that once in Class 5A much less three times.
Defensively, Brown has high expectations and that's only natural because 10
of the starters and 5 of the backups on his 1997 North Carolina team were N=
FL
draft picks. Three of his defensive linemen went in the first round.
But he says the Longhorns have some talent on defense and could be very goo=
d
if his young tackles come through.
The departures of two-time All-American Casey Hampton and his equally
formidable sidekick Shaun Rogers left a giant hole in the middle of the
Longhorn defense.
They were the run-stoppers deluxe who led a unit that ranked 12th nationall=
y
in rushing defense, yielding 94 yards a game last year.
Eight starters return from a Longhorn defense that also ranked seventh in t=
he
nation in total defense, yielding only 278.3 yards per game.
Brown also said Rogers, who missed several games with a badly sprained ankl=
e
was never close to 100% last year after being injured early in the season.
"Shaun was one of the best players of his size I have seen at rushing the
passer," he said. "When we lost him, it really hurt our pass rush."
I have speculated in previous issues that the Longhorns probably will have =
a
better pass rush from their front four this season because sophomore-to-be
Marcus Tubbs got 5.5 sacks, second on the team last year, while standing in
for Rogers, and because the defensive ends are a year older and there is mo=
re
speed at tackle than before.
Brown said the coaches are counting on a better pass rush from their lineme=
n
"Cory Redding and Kalen Thornton have the potential to be as good as anybod=
y
at defense end," he said. "We have high expectations for them.'
At tackle, he said Tubbs "weighs 285 and he can run. He's got a great upsid=
e.
He's a young guy who has played well already and should just get better and
better. We're excited about him."
Brown also said the move of Maurice Gordon from end to tackle "looks like a
good one. He runs a 4.6 and he looked really good this spring. We just need
him to keep on working hard and he'll be a  good one. He's already a good
pass rusher, and he's working on getting stronger to stop the run.
While Gordon is a pass-rushing whiz, the likely starter at tackle opposite
Tubbs is redshirt freshman Stevie Lee if he is able to recover fully from
foot surgery.
Lee played well last year in spots as a true freshman, but was injured earl=
y
and was able to get a medical redshirt year, which means he is a freshman
again this year.
If Lee is healthy, Brown said the key for him is off-season conditioning
work. "Stevie can play at about 300 pounds, but he doesn't need to play at
330," he said.
"In this league, everybody spreads people out, forcing the front four to ma=
ke
off-schedule plays. You can't just be a run stopper anymore. You've got to =
be
quick enough to make adjustments.
"We're emphasizing speed and quickness," he added. "That's why we made some
moves in the spring, like moving Maurice Gordon to tackle, O. J. McClintock
to end (from linebacker) and Lee Jackson to linebacker (from safety)."
Brown also said sophomore Adam Doiron, who also played well in relief last
season as a true freshman, has a bright future at tackle.
"He needs to get get stronger," Brown said. He's real smart and real tough.
He just needs to get more experience and use the off-season program to get
stronger."
He likes his secondary, saying, "I feel like we are in real good shape with
our secondary. We have guys who have the ability to cover and the speed to
make up ground. We also are two deep in the secondary for the first time
since we've been here."
The area where he wants to see the most improvement on defense is a
linebacker, where all three starters return.
"We have asked our linebackers to step it up," he said. "They have played
really well for us, but we want them to just take an extra step to get even
better."
The Longhorns had troubles with their place kicking in the spring, and Brow=
n
said the returnees and three walk-ons will compete for the starting job whe=
n
two-a-days begin in early August.
Summing up, he said the Longhorns' strengths are at quarterback, wide
receiver, tight end, the offensive line, the defensive ends and the seconda=
ry.
He said defensive tackle will be a strong position, too, if Lee returns
healthy and all the young players continue to improve.
When asked to comment on the most pleasant surprises from spring training,
Brown said, "Bo Scaife returning and looking like he is ready to play is on=
e.
Kyle Shanahan (a walk-on wide receiver) did some really good things. Derric=
k
Dockery finally being healthy again was a big positive development."
He said all of the "spin-down" moves the coaches made on defense this sprin=
g
are "looking good at this point. We wanted to improve our speed on defense,
and these moves have helped us accomplish that."
Asked about the biggest disappointment in the spring drills, he said, "It w=
as
nobody emerging at tailback. They all played good, but, after Ricky William=
s
and Hodges Mitchell, our expectations are very high."
True Orange Observations
Look for the Longhorns to use more one-back formations this season. Why? Th=
e
back-up wide receivers and tight ends are more dangerous than the fullbacks=
.
WR Sloan Thomas and TE Brock Edwards would start and star for many teams, b=
ut
they are backups at Texas.
Also, look for a lot more misdirection plays and other plays designed to ma=
ke
the offense less predictable than it was last season.
* * * *
With coach Mack Brown's first great class of recruits heading into their
third seasons, and two other great classes following it, this is the season
the Longhorns should be able to finish in the top 10 for the first time sin=
ce
1983.
For those of you who seem to get a little impatient at times, it is worth
noting that the Longhorns have finished in the top 20 just seven times sinc=
e
1983 and three of those seven times were in Brown's first three years here =
=01)
15th in 1998, 21st in 1999 and 12th in 2000.
This Longhorn team probably will start out about fifth or sixth in the
country and it should be able to stay in the top 10 unless some wheels fall
off.
The great thing about the way Brown has built this program is that he and h=
is
assistants recruit great prospects every year, and develop them.
I think this year will start a long string of years for UT  to be contendin=
g
for high national honors.
The only way you can win the highest national honor =01) a national champio=
nship
=01) is to get to the championship game.
Since only two teams get to the championship game, some very deserving team=
s
are left out. Miami and Washington, for example, were certainly deserving
last year, but unbeaten Oklahoma and once-beaten Florida State got the nod.
So, having an outstanding team doesn't guarantee a berth in the national
title game.
I won't predict the Longhorns will wind up in the Rose Bowl playing for the
national title this year, but I will predict that Brown will have us playin=
g
in a national championship game very soon.
Teams in the Big 12 and SEC have the extra burden of having to play a
post-season game for their conference titles, which means they have to play
two godzillas back to back to be No. 1.
But great teams can do it and Texas will be a great team in the very near
future. It might not be this year, but it could be if things break the
Longhorns' way.

2. OL Jonathan Scott, Dallas Carter (Texas)
3. OL Jami Hightower, Jacksonville
4. LB Derrick Johnson, Waco
5. RB Cedric Benson, Midland Lee (Texas)

7. RB David Underwood, Madisonville (Michigan)
8. C Ben Wilkerson, Hemphill
9. QB Matt Nordgren, Dallas Bishop Lynch
10. OL Abe Robinson, Jersey Village (Texas)
11. LB Jonathon Jackson, Galena Park North Shore
12. DE Kevin Everett, Port Arthur Jefferson
13. WR Armon Dorrough, Lancaster

23. LB Lance McFarland, Jefferson

Out-of-State Prospects

Texas is recruiting several out-of-state players. Here are the ones who are
still considering UT:
Quarterback
Bret Rawls, 6-5, 200, 4.7, Shreveport Evangel (LSU, UT, FSU, Tenn)
Running Back
Jabari Davis, 5-11, 224, 4.5, Tucker, Ga. (Tenn, Ga, UT, Neb, Ala)
Eric Shelton, 6-3, 230, 4.45, Lexington, Ky., Bryan Station (Ky, FSU, Fla,
Tenn, UT)
Fullback
James Buchanan, 6-2, 240, 4.7, Sarasota, Fla. Mooney (FSU, UT, Fla, BC)
Tight End
Marcus Spears, 6-5, 275, 4.8, Baton Rouge Southern Lab (LSU, A&M, Mich, UT)
Defensive End
Eric Hall, 6-3, 232, 4.5, Clarksville, Tenn., NW (UT, FSU, Tenn, Neb, LSU)
Shaun Cody, 6-5, 255, 4.8, Los Altos, Cal. (USC, UCLA, UT, Az, ND)
Kaelen Jakes, 6-5, 260, 4.8, Valencia, Cal. (UT, Az, USC, Neb, UCLA, Wash, =
ND)
Defensive Tackle
Marquise Hill, 6-7, 290, 4.8, N. Orleans De La Salle (FSU, LSU, Mich, A&M, =
UT)
* * * *
On the out-of-staters, UT has a 50-50 shot at Hall, and Rawls, Jakes and
Buchanan also are very seriously considering the Longhorns. Cody says he
definitely will visit UT, so the Horns have a fair chance with him. The odd=
s
are much longer on Davis, Shelton, Spears and Hill.

Scouting Louisiana-Lafayette

If the Longhorns don't break their 10-quarter scoring drought quickly in
their Sept. 9 season opener against Louisiana-Lafayette in Austin, it will =
be
a very bad sign.
The Ragin' Cajuns didn't do much ragin' last season, going 2-9 with their
only victories coming over 1-AA Wofford and Middle Tennessee.
They also gave up an average of 219 yards per game rushing and allowed
opposing backs to average 5.5 yards per rush.
The Cajuns run a spread offense with four wideouts, but they didn't score a
touchdown until their fifth game last season.
Coach Mack Brown says you don't really know what you have until you start
playing other teams. He still won't know after this day in the park.
The game starts at 11:30 a.m. on Sept. 9 and will be televised by the Fox
Network on a syndicated basis.

Baseball Adds 1, Loses 1

The Longhorn baseball coaches have signed shortstop Shaff Elkouri, 5-11, 17=
5,
from Seward County JC in Kansas, but they lost one of their prized recruits
last weekend when slugger Jason Stokes of Coppell signed with Florida for $=
2
million.
Elkouri will be a sophomore at Texas this season.

Big Basketball Recruiting Week Coming Up

The season opener in football is always big news, and it's also going to be=
 a
big deal for basketball this year because both Longhorn teams have some
big-time recruits taking official visits the Sept. 9 weekend.
It's really big for the men, who have only one scholarship remaining. T. J.
Ford, the 5-11 point guard who led Fort Bend Willowridge to the state Class
5A championship last season, will visit.
Ford is the player the UT coaches want, and there is a chance he will commi=
t
on his visit.
The Longhorn women have three scholarships left, and two outstanding player=
s
have scheduled visits for the Sept. 9 weekend.
One of them has a name you will remember. She is Lauren Selmon, a 6-0
guard-forward from Norman, Okla.
If that rings a bell, you are right. She is the daughter of Dewey Selmon, o=
ne
of those three great defensive line brothers who starred at Oklahoma a
quarter of a century ago.
I was in Oklahoma, working as a political reporter for The Associated Press=
,
when the Selmons played at OU. Unlike some of the later Sooner stars, who
made the wrong kind of headlines off the field, the Selmons are fine people
The other is Jody Bell, a 6-2 forward from Chestermere HS in Alberta, Canad=
a.
She averaged a triple double last season (14 points, 10 assists, 12 rebound=
s).

True Orange is going to 160 schools, thanks to several generous subscribers=

That Elusive Top 10

Is this the year the Longhorns finally will finish in that elusive top 10
nationally for the first time since 1983?
The Longhorns are in the top 10 right now at No. 9 in the AP poll and they
will stay in that elite group and even rise a little if they keep winning.
The biggest remaining obstacle to keeping winning is the game Saturday
against 5-1 Colorado.
The Longhorns are 10-point favorites over the Buffaloes, but Colorado, at 5-1
and with a five-game winning streak, is the most dangerous foe left on the
schedule.
Next up will be road trips to 2-3 Missouri ande 2-3 Baylor, teams which have
one Big 12 victory between them this season, followed by a game in Austin
against Kansas, also 2-3.
The Longhorns will be huge favorites in all three of those game.
Then comes the regular season finale at Texas A&M. The Aggies lost to
Colorado, 31-21, Saturday in Boulder to fall from the unbeaten ranks, but the
toughest part of their schedule remains to be played.
If  the Horns keep winning until the A&M game, they will be favored by at
least 10 points.
The Aggies have a good defense, but it isn't as good as the one at Texas, and
the Horns have a clear edge on offense.
So, barring an upset, the Longhorns should head for a bowl game at 10-1 and
with a national ranking in the top 5. A win in the bowl game would cement a
top 5 ranking, but a loss might knock the Horns just out of the top 10 in the
final poll.

Longhorn Game Notes . .

* After opening the game with a  12-play, 65-yard scoring drive, Oklahoma
State had six more possessions in the first half and gained 41 yards on 20
plays. In the second half, OSU started drives at the Texas 36 and 21 after
turnovers, but came away with zero points. After its opening TD drive,
Oklahoma State gained only  97 yards and had 163 for the game, its lowest
total of the season.
* QB Chris Simms was involved in all six  Texas touchdowns with a 1-yard
rushing TD and scoring passes of 27 yards to Brock Edwards, 5 and 16 yards to
Roy Williams and  27 and  23 yards to Sloan Thomas. He fell one short of the
UT record of seven set by Clyde Littlefield against Daniel Baker (4 pass/3
rush) in 1915. The last Longhorn to account for six touchdowns in a game was
Ricky Williams against Rice in 1998.
* Freshman LB Derrick Johnson had two tackles for losses in the first half to
move into a tie for third place on UT's all-time freshman list. He has 10
TFLs for the season, just six short of the Longhorns record held by Tony
Brackens who had 16 in 1993.
* Sophomore WR Sloan Thomas had six catches for 82 yards Saturday. Both were
career bests. His  previous highs were three catches against Missouri in 2000
and 74 yards against Texas A&M in 2000. He tied his career high with two TD
passes, last accomplishing the feat against Missouri.

UT No. 22 in Basketball Poll

The Longhorn men's basketball team has been ranked No. 22 in the ESPN.com
pre-season top 25.
Texas is one of five Big 12 Conference teams selected in the Top 25, joining
Kansas (5), Missouri (8), Oklahoma State (16) and Oklahoma (19).
The Longhorns return 57 percent of their scoring, 69 percent of their
rebounding and 63 percent of their minutes played totals from last year's
25-9 team which finished with a No. 18 national ranking in the AP poll.
Texas starts its exhibition schedule with the annual intrasquad scrimmage at
7 p.m. on Wednesday, October 31 at the Erwin Center.  Admission is free.

Top UT Basketball Assistant Gets Head Job at Siena

Rob Lanier, 32, the Longhorns' top assistant basketball coach and lead=20
recruiter for the last two years, was named head coach at Siena College
in=20
Loudonville, N.Y., Wednesday.
UT head coach Rick Barnes was out of town on a recruiting trip, but he

a statement praising Lanier and saying he is as qualified to be a head
coach=
=20
as any assistant coach he has known.
Barnes gave no indication when he will name a new assistant. Six of his=20
former assistants have become college head coaches and that is because
he=20
always hires a bright, young assistant on the way up who also happens to
be=20
an outstanding recruiter. He only has them for a year or two, but they
are=20
very productive during that time, and then he goes out and finds
another=20

QUAN COSBY UPDATE: I talked to Albert Satchell tonight. He is the guardian

he probably would give up football if he is one of the first 10 players=20
chosen in the major league draft. Some callers have told me today that the
T=
V=20
reporter quoted Cosby as saying he would choose baseball if he is drafted
in=
=20
the first 10 rounds. I didn't hear the TV report, but there is a big=20
difference in being one of the first 10 players drafted and being drafted
in=

the first 10 rounds. With 30 major league teams, 300 players will be
chosen=20
in the first 10 rounds. Anyway, after talking to Satchell, my blood
pressure=
=20
has returned to normal because Cosby, while he is a great athlete and=20
undoubtedly is an outstanding baseball player, will not be one of the
first=20
10 players drafted. He probably will be one of the first 300. The
biggest=20
difference in being one of the first 10 guys drafted and being the 300th

 Barnes Hires New Assistant; Summer Football Camps Start Next Week

 Texas basketball coach Rick Barnes announced Tuesday he has hired South=20
 Carolina assistant coach Frank Haith to replace Rob Lanier as one of his
 top=
 =20
 assistants.
 The 35-year-old Haith, who joined coach Dave Odom's staff at South
 Carolina=20
 on April 16 after spending the past four seasons under Odom at Atlantic
 Coas=
 t=20
 Conference member Wake Forest, will begin his post at Texas immediately.
 =20
 Haith assumes the post vacated by Lanier, who left the Texas coaching
 staff=20
 on April 18 to take the head coaching position at Siena College.
 While at Wake Forest, Haith was instrumental in leading the Demon Deacons
 to=
 =20
 four consecutive postseason tournament appearances, including an NCAA
 First=20
 Round showing last season.  He also helped Wake Forest secure one of
 the=20
 nation's Top 10 recruiting classes during the 1999-2000 campaign.=20
 "In Frank Haith, we have hired one of the top assistant coaches in the=20
 nation,"  Barnes said.  "He came very highly recommended from many of
 the=20
 high school coaches in the state of Texas and around the nation.  Frank
 also=
 =20
 brings a great deal of familiarity with coaching and recruiting in this
 area=
 =20
 of the country.  There is no question that it is just a matter of time
 befor=
 e=20
 he becomes a head coach at this level."
 Prior to joining the staff at Wake Forest, Haith served one year as the=20
 associate head coach at Texas A&M (1996-97).  He spent one season
 (1995-96)=20
 as an assistant coach at Penn State, helping the Nittany Lions to a
 21-7=20
 overall record.  During the year, Penn State was ranked as high as ninth
 in=20
 the national polls before placing second in the Big Ten Conference=20
 regular-season standings and earning the school's first NCAA Tournament
 bid=20
 in 31 years.
 "I am extremely excited about the opportunity to coach at The University
 of=20
 Texas," Haith said.  "There were two things that proved to be the key
 factor=
 s=20
 in my decision to come to Austin.  One is the opportunity to work for
 Rick=20
 Barnes.  And second, having worked in College Station for four years, I
 know=
 =20
 the potential that exists in Austin.  The Texas program is one that can
 win=20
 the National Championship."
 * * * *
 ILB Aaron Harris of Mesquite, RB Albert Hardy of Galena Park, DE Travis=20
 Leitko of The Woodlands and C Bob Morton of McKinney have at least two
 thing=
 s=20
 in common. They are the state's best players at their respective
 positions=20
 and they have already achieved qualifying scores on the SAT.
 Morton is committed to Texas A&M. Hardy favors Texas very strongly, and=20
 Harris and Leitko are considering several schools, including UT.
 This is a year when many of the top junior recruits have awesome test
 scores=
 .=20
 OL Josiah Vinson of Irving has a 1,500 SAT score and Leitko and Morton are
 i=
 n=20
 the 1,400 range.
 Unfortunately, it's also a year when many of the super recruits will wind
 up=
 =20
 having to go to the junior college ranks unless they sign with Oklahoma.
 Two=
 =20
 top  Sooner recruits from Texas are full qualifiers now and they were
 about=20
 300 points away from qualifying when they signed back in February.
 Coach Mack Brown and his assistants might seem to be starting a little
 bit=20
 slow in recruiting this year, but they actually are right on schedule.
 June=20
 is summer camp month at Texas and it's also when the Longhorn coaches
 start=20
 racking up pledges from top recruits. They have been doing it ever since
 the=
 y=20
 got here, and they will do it again this year. Look for the Horns to get

Volume 10, No. 24, September 25, 2000

Defense, Special Teams Dominant in 48-0 Rout;
Longhorns 2-1 Heading into Big 12 Action

The Longhorns stampeded past the Houston Cougars, 48-0, Saturday night in
Austin, posting their first home shutout in nine years and getting dominati=
ng
play from the defense and special teams.
The victory got Texas back on the winning track and pulled the Longhorns up
to No. 13 in both major polls. The Longhorns are 2-1 heading into their Big
12 opener Saturday against Oklahoma State.
The Longhorn defense was so dominant that it scored two touchdowns, and
Houston, which has one of the nation's most potent offenses, got inside the
Texas 20-yard line only two times.
The defense blocked a field goal to blunt the first threat and sacked Couga=
r
QB Jason McKinley, forcing a fumble, to kill the second one.
Special teams, a headache a week ago in the loss at Stanford, were
outstanding. Kris Stockton punted for a 45.6-yard average and had three pun=
ts
killed inside the UH 20, including one at the 1-yard line. UT also blocked =
a
field goal and got a special teams touchdown when Quentin Jammer caused a
fumble on a punt and Michael Ungar recovered it in the Houston end zone.
The offense started slowly, making only two first downs and getting only on=
e
net yard in the first quarter, but the great defensive effort provided a
safety net and the offense started moving more efficiently as the game
progressed.
Head coach Mack Brown and offensive coordinator Greg Davis said the offense
has been under so much pressure to play better that they thought the player=
s
were a little too tight to start the game.
McKinley was one of the nation's top passers heading into the game after
three straight 300-yard passing game, but a fierce Texas pass rush limited
him to 173 yards through the air on 14 of 34 passing and sacked him nine
times for minus 59 yards. The Horns also picked him off twice and returned
both for touchdowns.
Here, briefly, is how the game went:
FIRST QUARTER
Texas won  the toss and deferred. Houston drove to midfield and punted.
Sophomore Chris Simms' got the start at quarterback for Texas, but his firs=
t
pass bounced off WR Montrell Flowers' hands and was intercepted by Cougar F=
S
Hanik Milligan at the UT 37. The Longhorn defense held, with LB Everick Raw=
ls
getting a sack, and Mike Clark tried a 39-yard field goal, but UT LB Tyrone
Jones blocked it. But the Horns couldn't move and had to punt. Then the
defense took over, putting Texas on top to stay. Redshirt freshman SS Dakar=
ai
Pearson, getting his first start in place of the injured Lee Jackson,
intercepted McKinley's pass down the middle and galloped 42 yards untouched
to put Texas on top, 7-0, with 6:56 left. Moments later, Stockton got a gre=
at
punt that went 63 yards and was killed at the UH 1. The Longhorn defense
forced Houston to punt from the 3 and TB Hodges Mitchell ran the kick back =
16
yards to the 27. Applewhite came in at QB and backup TB Victor Ike got 4
yards, then 6 more to the 17 behind good line blocking. But the Cougars
swarmed Ike for a 1-yard loss on the last play of the quarter. The Cougars
had a big statistical advantage for the quarter, leading 5-2 in first downs
and 61-1 in total offense, but, thanks to the blocked field goal and the
defensive TD, UT led, 7-0.
SECOND QUARTER
Applewhite fumbled the snap, but recovered it for a 3-yard loss. He hit
Mitchell for 8 yards to the 13, and Stockton kicked a 30-yard field goal fo=
r
a 10-0 lead with 13:26 left. Pearson recovered a Cougar fumble a minute lat=
er
at the Cougar 37, and the Longhorns' third TB, Kenny Hayter got five yards =
in
two tough runs, then Applewhite hit freshman WR B. J. Johnson for 17 yards =
to
the UH 14. A sreen pass to freshman WR Sloan Thomas lost 4 to the 18, but
then Applewhite found Johnson again with a quick pass in the flat and he
turned on the speed to the 1-yard line. Ike scored on the next play and
Stockton's kick gave UT a 17-0 lead with 9:34 left. The Longhorn defenders
again forced a quick Houston punt, but Applewhite threw an interception to
give Houston another shot from midfield. Simms came back in at QB on the ne=
xt
series and played the remainder of the quarter. At the half, despite having
three passes intercepted and having gained only 86 yards, the Longhorns wer=
e
in control at 17-0. Houston had only 88 yards offensively.
THIRD QUARTER
With Applewhite back at the controls, Texas opened the second half by drivi=
ng
58 yards to set up a 39-yard Stockton field goal that raised UT's lead to
20-0 with 11:20 left. A 16-yard run by Mitchell and passes of 17 and 11 yar=
ds
from Applewhite to WR Montrell Flowers did most of the damage on the drive.
The Cougars came right back with their only sustained drive of the game,
zipping from their own 22 to the UT 6, but DE Cory Redding sacked McKinley
and he fumbled, with Redding covering the loose ball. That was the Cougars'
last scoring threat. The Longhorns punted quickly, but Jammer's jarring
tackle forced a fumble on the return and Ungar fell on it in the end zone f=
or
another Texas TD and a 27-0 lead with 8:29 left. Neither team threatened
again in the quarter.
FOURTH QUARTER
Applewhite hit Mitchell for 27 and Flowers for 15 on the Horns' first
possession, then Mitchell ran 12 yards to the Houston 2. Hayter came in and
got the TD to give Texas a 34-0 advange with 9:51 left. On Houston's next
possession, UT LB O. J. McClintock intercepted McKinley's pass and returned
it 23 yards for a score and a 41-0 lead with 9:21 left. Simms came back in
and engineered the Horns' final TD drive, hitting passes of 12 yards to
backup TB Ivan Williams, 16 to Flowers and then the 6-yard scoring pass to
fullback Matt Trissel with 3:11 left. The Horns almost scored again in the
final minute when Simms hit true freshman WR Sloan Thomas for 44 yards to t=
he
Cougar 10, but Williams fumbled on the final play.
SUMMARY
The Texas defense was a picture of consistency Saturday, never allowing
Houston to get anything going offensively.
The Cougars  ran 21 plays for 61 yards in the first quarter, 15 plays for 2=
7
yards in the second period, 11 plays for 57 yards in the third quarter and =
23
plays for 53 yards in the fourth quarter.
The Texas offense started slowly, running 12 plays for one net yard in the
first quarter, getting 19 plays for 85 yards in the second period, running =
20
plays for 102 yards in the third quarter and wrapping up with an 18-play,
161-yard final period.
UT-OU Likely 11 a.m. Start
The official announcement won't come until noon today, but it's pretty
certain that the Texas-Oklahoma game will begin at 11 a.m. on Oct 7 in Dall=
as
and will be televised by ABC.

Computer Guru Nixes Horns

Jeff Sagarin, the MIT mathermatics graduate who rates football teams for
several major publications, currently has the Longhorns right in the middle
of the Big 12 pack.
Sagarin has Nebraska No. 2 in the country and No. 1 in the Big 12, followed
by Kansas State at 13th and second, Oklahoma at 16th and third, Texas A&M a=

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday afternoon the Longhorns are improving in a lot
of areas, but still need to play better.
"On defense, our secondary has improved a lot," he said. "Our young defensi=
ve
ends are playing a lot better. Last night was one of the few times that we
didn't give up big plays in the passing game. We had a good pass rush, and
the secondary did a good job."
"Offensively, we are starting to run it a little bit better, but we are sti=
ll
not running it like we need to," he said. "I also think we are gaining a lo=
t
of depth."
"Our special teams last night were outstanding," Brown said. "They were as
good as they have been since we got here."
He said TB Hodges Mitchell was chosen as the offensive player of the game,
and FS Quentin Jammer, whose hard tackle on a punt forced a fumble that
resulting in a Texas' touchdown, was the defensive player of the game.
He said three players shared the honors for the special teams. They were LB
Tyrone Jones, who blocked a field goal, Jammer and walk-on Michael Ungar, w=
ho
covered the fumbled punt Jammer caused for his first collegiate touchdown.
Brown said he was pleased the offense did "score four of the five time it g=
ot
in the red zone, with the only failure being the one at the end of the game=
."
He also said some of the Longhorns' young defensive players really came of
age against Houston.
Brown said sophomore DE Cory Redding "played by far his best game," and he
said redshirt freshman DT Marcus Tubbs "had two of our nine sacks. "We're
really excited about his quickness off the ball and his explosiveness. He a=
nd
(redshirt freshman safety) Dakarai Pearson were really pleasant surprises."
Asked about throwing deep in the final minute of the game, Brown said, "It'=
s
really a hard decision when you look at it. My job is to do what's best for
our football team."
He said the two big factors to consider were that sophomore QB Chris Simms
"needed some confidence, and Houston had just gone for a fourth and six at
their 45-yard line."
"We had five freshmen in there at the end of the game and Chris hadn't had =
a
lot of success. I wasn't trying to run up the score, but I have to do what'=
s
best for our team."

INJURY UPDATE: Brown said the rash of injuries at defensive tackle has real=
ly
cut into the team's depth.
All-Big 12 Shaun Rogers suffered a sprained ankle on an illegal chop block
and Brown said he won't have any idea how long Rogers will be out until he
talks to the team doctors Monday.
Freshman Stevie Lee (sore foot) and redshirt freshman Ryan Haywood (sore
shoulder) didn't suit up for the Houston game. Brown said Haywood might hav=
e
a rotary cuff problem, which might require surgery to repair.
Safety Lee Jackson, who missed the Houston game with a strained hamstring, =
is
expected back for Oklahoma State.
Freshman wide receiver Roy Williams also suffered a bruised arm early in th=
e
Houston game, but it did not appear to be an injury that would sideline him
against Oklahoma State.
Junior offensive tackle Mike Williams sustained a bruised collarbone that
sidelined him for the rest of the game, but its severity is not known.

Football Notes . .

Five players scored their first touchdowns as Longhorns. They are redshirt
freshman safety Dakarai Pearson, who had a 42-yard interception return for =
a
score; sophomore linebacker O. J. McClintock, who ran another interception
back 23 yards for a touchdown; redshirt freshman running back Kenny Hayter,
who scored on a 2-yard run; sophomore fullback Matt Trissel, who ran six
yards for the final touchdown, and walk-on Michael Ungar, who recovered a
fumble in the end zone.
* * * *
The official statistics for the game credited Texas with eight sacks, but
coach Mack Brown said Sunday the defensive staff said the team had nine
sacks. Either way, it's great pass rushing. Defensive ends Jermain Anderson
and Cory Redding had three of them. Defensive coordinator Carl Reese has be=
en
saying he needs to get more production from his ends, and he got his wish
Saturday night.
* * * *
The victory gives the Longhorns a 14-7-2 lead in their matchups with the
Cougars. Texas leads 8-4-1 in games played in Austin.
* * * *
The home crowd of 81,592 was the 14th largest in Royal Memorial Stadium
history and was the ninth sellout in the last 11 home games. Nine of the to=
p
16 crowds in school history have come during Brown's tenure as head coach.
* * * *
The Longhorns are 16-0 under Brown when they outrush their opponent. Texas
had 96 net yards rushing Saturday. Houston had 13.
* * * *
The Longhorn defense has denied opponents a first down in 22 of 38
possessions this season.
* * * *
Texas has returned three fumbles for touchdowns in its last nine games afte=
r
going 50 straight games from 1995 to 1999 without one.

Texas' last home shutout was 32-0 over TCU on Nov. 16, 1991. The last shuou=

Key Statistics

Houston started four drives in Texas territory. A field goal was blocked on
one, a punt on fourth-and-3 ended another and UH was pushed back across
midfield with losses totaling 35 yards on the other two. That, folks, is
defensive dominance.

Texas Women Sign Center

UT women's basketball coach Jody Conradt already had a lot of tall recruits
in her nationally ranked recruiting class, but she didn't have a true center
until last week when she won a long battle to sign 6-2 Spring Westfield
center Mercedes Williams.
Williams averaged 16 points, 7.8 rebounds and 3.7 steals per game in leading
Westfield to a 33-3 record and a berth in the state Class 5A finals.
She was on the All-State team and was the Houston Chronicle's Player of the
Year.
She is a strong physical presence in the paint and relishes the tough play
around the basket. She will provide much needed depth behind Stacy Stephens
and Annissa Hastings at center for the Longhorns.
"With the addition of Mercedes, we now have five newcomers who immediately
raise the overall talent level of our program," Conradt said, adding that all
five players "are considered among the very best players coming out of their
respective states."
The other four signees are:
* 6-2 forward Kala Bowers of Woodward, Okla., the Oklahoma Player of the Year
* 6-2 Heather Schreiber of Windthorst,  the top player in Texas and a Parade
All-American
* 5-11 guard-forward Coco Reed of Houston Jersey Village
* Canadian Junior National team player Jody Bell, a 6-2 forward from
Chestermere High School  in Alberta.
The Longhorns had a top 10 recruiting class nationally before signing
Williams.

Women's Tennis in Sweet 16

The No. 13-ranked Texas women's tennis team beat No. 19 TCU, 4-1, Sunday in
Austin in the second round of the NCAA regional playoffs.
Texas, 21-8, advances to the NCAA round of 16 and will play No. 2 Duke
Thursday in Stone Mountain, Ga.
The Longhorns played Duke earlier this season, losing 4-3 in Austin.
TCU finished 21-4.

Men's Tennis Team Falls to LSU

The No. 22-ranked Longhorn men's tennis team fell to LSU, 4-2, Sunday in
Baton Rouge in the second round of the NCAA playoffs.
The Longhorns end the season 18-6, while LSU advances to the Round of 16.

Longhorn Golfers in Regional

The No. 5-ranked Longhorn golf team will compete in the NCAA Central Regional
Championships in Stillwater Oklahoma Thursday through Saturday.
Texas finished third in the Maxwell Invitational in Ardmore, Okla., last
weekend, shooting a 16-over par 853 to finish five strokes behind tourney
champ Tulsa.

UT Basketball Recruits Honored

Texas basketball coach Rick Barnes' two recruits both ranked among the
nation's elite players at their positions.
Good national basketball ratings are hard to find, but Student Sports
Magazine recently came out with a ranking of the top 25 players at each
position for a national top 125 overall.
Point guard T. J. Ford, 5-11, of Fort Bend Willowridge, ranked No. 8 at his
position and 6-10 center Chris Wright of Redwater ranked No. 25 among the big
guys in the middle.
Most rating services had Ford much higher, but it is a great tribute to
Wright's potential that he made the list of the top 25 centers because he
missed almost all of his senior year with a torn ACL that required surgery.
Ford's 39-0 Willowridge team also was ranked No. 2 in the nation by Student
Sports, and the Eagles were the top-ranked public school team.
Mouth of Wilson, Va., which gives scholarships and recruits all over the
nation, was ranked No. 1, but the Warriors are an all-star team with players
from several states and countries.
Ford also made the magazine's 10-man first team senior All-American list,
which was surprising since he was rated only No. 8 in the point-guard
category.
I suppose they have two gurus with different views of the point guards. I go
along with the one who rated Ford as one of the top two point guards because
every other rating service I saw had him as one of the top two or three point
guards in the nation.

Evans Testing Pro Waters

Junior Longhorns swingman Maurice Evans, 6-5, 220, has declared himself
eligible for June 27 NBA draft.
Evans, who led the Horns in scoring last year with a 15.6 average, has not
hired an agent and can return to Texas for his senior season if he doesn't
elect to turn pro.
While Evans is a fine college player, he lacks great dribbling skills at this
point and probably won't be drafted. He could benefit from another year under
coach Rick Barnes' tutelage.

Horns Recruiting Top JC Guard

The Longhorns are in the running for a top junior college combo guard.
Terrell Ross, 6-4, a point guard with fine shooting skills at Allegany JC in 
Meadville, Md, visited UT three weeks ago and has narrowed his picks to
Texas, Mississippi State and Michigan State.
Tuesday is the deadline for signing letters of intent in basketball, so he
will sign with someone right away or his recruiting will drag on until he
shows up on a college campus to start classes.
He led Allegany to a 31-3 record and the National JC championship game.
He averaged only 8.9 points a game for a loaded team that features four other
Division I signees, but he hit 60% of his shots from the field and 74.3% of
his free throws. He also is an outstanding defensive player and rebounder.

I just got this from UT. I didn't have time to edit it much. Enjoy.

Barnes Signs Top JC Guard

A junior college combo guard has signed a National Letter
of Intent to play basketball next season at The University of Texas, head
coach Rick Barnes announced Monday morning.
Terrell Ross (Laurel, Md./Allegany College) will join the Longhorns and have
two years of eligibility remaining beginning with the 2001-02 campaign.
"Terrell is a versatile player with good size who can
help our backcourt play in many ways," Barnes said.  "He handles the ball
and sees the floor well, can score and defend, and is a good worker.  The
most attractive thing about Terrell is that he comes from one of the most
storied junior college programs in the nation and received great coaching
while at Allegany."
Ross (6-4, 190), the starting point guard for the past two years under
legendary coach Bob Kirk at Allegany College (Cumberland, Md.), averaged
9.3 points, 7.7 assists and 6.3 rebounds per game while earning first-team
NJCAA (National Junior College Athletic Association) Division I All-America
and first-team All-Region XX honors during his sophomore season.  He led
the Trojans to an overall record of 32-3 and a runner-up finish at the
NJCAA Division I Championship this past year.  Ross converted 52.2% of his
field goals, 33.8% (20-of-59) from three-point range and 74.3% (81-of-109)
from the free throw line as a sophomore.
In his freshman campaign, Ross helped Allegany to a 28-2 record and a No. 3
ranking in the final NJCAA Division I poll.  He averaged 8.1 points, 7.5
assists (2.92 assist-to-turnover ratio) and 5.1 rebounds per game while
hitting 63.1% of his field goals and 47.2% (17-of-36) from three-point
range during his freshman year.  Ross received honorable mention NJCAA
Division I All-America and first-team All-Region XX accolades.
Ross joins a duo of fall signees on the Longhorns roster:  T.J. Ford
(Houston, Texas) and Chris Wright (Redwater, Texas).  UT will also gain the
services of junior walk-on forward Deginald Erskin (Gonzalez, Texas) who
sat out the 2000-01 campaign under NCAA transfer rules but was allowed to
practice with the team.

 Longhorns Zap Aggies (New Mexico Brand);
Freshmen Show Up Raring and Ready to Play

The Longhorns opened the 2001 season Saturday night before a sellout crowd in
Austin with an easy 41-7 victory over New Mexico State that gave positive
answers to most team question marks.
Two super freshmen and a freshman walk-on kicker even gave some hope for
those tough games down the line.
The kicker, Dusty Mangum of Mesquite, kicked two field goals and and five
extra points flawlessly. That might not sound like a big deal, particularly
since the field goals were short ones.
But if you had watched the place kickers in the spring, you would be ecstatic
that young Mangum seemed to be close to dead center on all seven of his first
collegiate kicks.
The other two freshmen are much more heralded, and rightly so, judging by
what they did Saturday night.
LB Derrick Johnson came in a a backup, but he had six tackles and caught
caught slippery RB Walter Taylor for a three-yard loss on a screeen pass that
appeared to be well executed until he sped past the blockers and nailed
Taylor.
Taylor hit the Longhorns for 113 yards rushing on just 13 carries with his
stop-and-go style, and he had only two plays that lost yardage all night.
That was one of them.
While Johnson is a heralded recruit, fellow freshman RB Cedric Benson is even
more highly touted after leading Midland Lee to three straight state titles,
and he gave a glimpse of his tremendous talent in a mop-up role Saturday.
He didn't get into the game until the fourth quarter, and then he did most of
his running behind the second-team defensive line.
But, with all due respect to Victor Ike and Ivan Williams, the top two
tailbacks, Benson showed talents that most running backs can only dream about
For starters, he has acceleration that is off the chart when he takes a
handoff. He also has great vision and knows instinctively where to run. He
also has an ability to make most tacklers miss without appearing to do
anything to make them miss. That means he doesn't have to slow down to do it.
He and Williams tied for top rushing honors with indentical stats - 15
carries for 64 yards and a touchdown.
Coach Mack Brown pointed out that it was easier sledding for Benson than for
Ike and Williams because he entered the game in the fourth quarter after the
Aggie defenders were tired.
But Ike and Williams did all their running behind the first-team line. The
offensive line is not a great run-blocking unit, so it figures that the
backups are even less adept at run blocking.
My nominees for the biggest positive surprises on offense and defense are
easy ones. WR Montrell Flowers and LB Tyrone Jones are seniors who have had
solid, but not spectacular careers.
Flowers caught two touchdown passes Saturday night and Jones had six tackles,
including two for losses.
Here, briefly, is how the game went:

First Quarter
Texas won the toss and deferred, so New Mexico State took the ball. That
turned out to be a great decision for the Horns because New Mexico State
fumbled the opening kickoff and the Longhorns had a 14-0 lead before either
team ran a play on the Texas end of the field. Tony Jeffery and Rod Babers
blocked a punt and Phillip Geiggar covered it in the end zone for the first
Texas touchdown and Mangum kicked his first extra point in college to give
Texas a 7-0 lead with 11:58 left. The Horns drove 50 yards on their second
possession to take a 14-0 lead when Williams scored on a 4-yard run and
Mangum kicked the extra point with 5:40 left in the period. Neither team had
much offense in the quarter - Texas had 30 yards on 16 plays and NM State had
26 on 14 plays - but two Aggie fumbles - the only turnovers in the game -
gave the Longhorns the two touchdown lead.

Second Quarter
Nathan Vasher's 16-yard punt return to the Aggies' 38 set up a field goal
drive. Ike got 15 yards on two strong runs, but then the drive stalled and
Mangum kicked his first college field goal, a 24-yarder, to give Texas a 17-0
lead with 7:24 left. The Horns scored another TD on their next possession,
going 80 yards in 11 plays. Flowers had a 23-yard catch and then a 9-yarder
for the TD. Mangum kicked the point for a 24-0 lead with 38 seconds left in
the half. Texas had 66 offensive yards in the quarter, while the Longhorn
defense was holding NM State to 3 net yards.

Third Quarter
Both teams got their offenses cranked up to start the third quarter. Texas
had a 79-yard drive to set up a 17-yard Mangum field goal to start the half,
but then Aggie TB Taylor's 43-yard run took the visitors deep into Longhorn
territory for the first time in the game. The drive reached the UT 14 before
stalling, and the field goal try was wide. After a Texas punt, NM State drove
85 yards in 9 plays to score and cut the UT lead to 27-7 with 1:02 left.

Fourth Quarter
Benson came in to start the fourth quarter and carried seven straight times
for 45 yards. Simms hit Flowers for 10 yards and the touchdown to cap the
drive. Mangum's kick gave UT a 34-7 lead with 9:28 left. The defense got a
quick stop and Major Applewhite relieved Simms at QB. With Applewhite hitting
four of five passes for 46 yards, including a 17-yard completion to Benson,
the Horns moved to the three and Benson ran over right tackle for his first
collegiate touchdown. Mangum's kick gave UT a 41-7 lead with 28 seconds left.

Recruiting Roundup

The Longhorns still have 12 commitments, but they have a good chance to pick
up another one this weekend.
The North Carolina game has been dedicated to the memory of former Longhorn
defense tackle Cole Pittman, who was killed in a tragic automobile accident
while returning to spring football practice at UT last February.
Pittman's younger brother, Chase, is an outstanding defensive end at
Shreveport Evangel and is one of the nation's top 100 players.
He took an official visit to LSU last weekend and will be at Texas this
weekend with his parents to participate in the events surrounding the game's
dedication to his brother.
LSU and Texas are the only schools he is still considering. He also took an
official visit to Oklahoma, but has eliminated the Sooners from
consideration. Look for a decision next week.
Evangel, one of the nation's top football powers, played Longview in
Shreveport last weekend and took a 27-7 victory on a muddy field.
Longview ran away from Pittman's side of the line all night, but he still had
eight tackles, including two sacks and two others for losses.
LB Marvin Byrdsong of Longview, was another national top 100 player in that
game.
He says he plans to come to the Texas-North Carolina game Saturday. "I like
Texas and will definitely take an official visit to Texas later," he said.
* * * *
DT Marco Martin of Mesquite has a qualifying ACT  score and just needs to
make good grades this year to be qualified in core courses, too.
He has made a lot of progress in the classroom after missing part of last
season because of academic deficiencies.
Martin, a 6-4, 315-pounder with incredible speed and quickness, is on all the
national top 100 lists. He lists the Longhorns No. 1.
* * * *
Top recruits who attended the Longhorns' opener were LB Garnett Smith of
Arlington Lamar,  RB Paul Mosley of Austin Anderson and six players who are
committed to UT - LBs Brian Robison of Splendora and Marcus Myers of
Pflugerville Connally, DL Tully Janszen of Keller, RB/Athlete Clint Haney of
Smithson Valley, WR Dustin Miksch of Round Rock Westwood and OL Brett Valdez
of Brownwood.
Haney scored on runs of 34 and 3 yards and had 99 yards rushing Friday in
Smithson Valley's 27-7 victory over Killeen Ellison. That game was called at
the half because of heavy thunderstorms.
Miksch caught three passes for 45 yards and had a 10-yard run in Westwood's
9-0 loss to Killeen Friday.
Smith said he really enjoyed the game Saturday night and loves the way the UT
linebackers blitz.
"I've seen them play on television," he said, "but being there and seeing it
in person was a great experience. I love the way the bring linebackers on
nearly every play and the way the disquise who they are going to bring.
That's the kind of defense I'm looking for."

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown worries about openers, so he was particularly happy about
the Longhorns' 41-7 romp past New Mexico State Saturday night.
"We had two areas we really wanted to concentrate on," he said. "Defensively,
we wanted to hit people and force turnovers. Offensively, we wanted to be
physical."
He said the team graded high in both areas.
"We forced three turnovers on defense," he said, "and we hit people and flew
around and made plays most of the time. We had some lapses, and we need to
work on correcting that."
He said he was pleased that the offense did not turn the ball over and was
able to overpower New Mexico State's defenders and run the ball despite a
stacked defense.
"Except for six plays, I though the offense played really, really well," he
said.
Those six plays included three to start the game, when a fumbled kickoff set
Texas up at the Aggies' 23 and the Horns lost 12 yards in three plays and had
to punt.
The other three were on the Longhorns' drive to open the second half. They
got a first-and-goal at the 1 and wound up kicking a field goal.
Brown said the Longhorns gave up on the run in the first two games last year
because of stacked defenses, "and then we couldn't run it when we needed to
at Stanford and we got beat."
"I told the staff before this game that I didn't care if they had 14 on the
line of scrimmage, we were going to run the ball," he said.
"We only ran three plays," Brown said, "but we ran them a whole bunch. We
just wanted to line up and be physical."
The Longhorns ran 45 times for 171 net yards and passed 38 times for 228
yards, and Brown said that is the kind of production he wanted.
He said there were some plays where the quarterback normally would have
audibled and called a pass, "but we wanted to force the run and that's

Coach's Corner . . (continued from page 1)
what we did. We have to be able to run the ball when we want to, regardless
of the defensive alignment."
Brown said DT Maurice Gordon played an outstanding game in his first start
after moving from a backup DE spot.
"Maurice is an outstanding pass rusher," he said. "We already knew that, but
he also stood up well against the run. He runs a 4.5 and he's a defensive end
playing defensive tackle. His speed really helps us in there."
After the game Saturday night, Brown said he felt it was the Longhorns best
opening game in his four years at Texas.
Monday, he said, "After reviewing the film, this definitely was our best
opener at Texas. I was concerned about the kicking game and turnovers. You
always worry about that in openers, and our kicking game was really good and
we didn't turn the ball over."
Brown said WR Kyle Shanahan has been cleared to practice this week, but he
said LB Lee Jackson's turf toe is still bothering him.

Ross Leaves, Plans to Return

Freshman CB Aaron Ross has left the team to clear up some NCAA Clearinghouse
issues.
"I have some Clearinghouse issues I need to get resolved in order to rejoin
the team," Ross said. "I'm  going to get those issues worked out so I can
return to Texas in January."
LB Aurmon Satchell had similar issues last year and he is back on the team
now and is a second-team linebacker. Look for Ross to be able to clear up the
problems and come back in time to go through spring practice next season.

Part 2

Scouting Oklahoma State
The Longhorns open defense of their Big 12 South championship Saturday at 1=
1
a.m. against Oklahoma State in a game that will be televised by ABC.
The Cowboys opened their season with a 36-26 win over Tulsa, then blanked
Southwest Texas, 23-0, before suffering their first loss at the hands of
nationally ranked Southern Mississipp, 28-6, Saturday.
The Cowboys have one of the most balanced offenses in college football,
averaging 191 yards rushing and 178 passing.
The Longhorns, on the other hand, have lived and died by the pass this
season. However, they ran the ball better last week and hope to be able to
test the Cowboy's defense, which is No. 1 nationally against the run.
QB Tony Lindsay has always played well against Texas, but he has had injury
problems throughout his career and he was knocked out of the loss to Southe=
rn
Mississippi with a shoulder injury in the third quarter.
RB Reggie White, a 230-pounder with good speed, has been the go-to guy on t=
he
ground for the Cowboys.
White could pose a problem for the Longhorns because their normally stout
middle defense has been weakened by injuries to DTs Shawn Rogers (knee),
Stevie Lee (foot) and Ryan Haywood (shoulder).
It is doubtful that Rogers, an All-Big 12 selection, will be able to play
Saturday. Redshirt freshman Marcus Tubbs played well against Houston after
Rogers was hurt, but depth will be a problem unless Lee can return. He and
Tubbs were the second-team tackles.
Defensively, the Cowboys are led by an outstanding front four, headed by en=
ds
Zac Warner and Juqua Thomas, who had 13 sacks each last year to lead the te=
am.
The Cowboys are inexperienced in the secondary, but it won't matter if Warn=
er
and Thomas can get to the UT quarterbacks before they throw.
The Horns should win this one, but it could be close.
Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):

Big 12 Roundup
Texas Tech visits Texas A&M and Kansas State travels to Colorado in the
headliners of the Big 12 Conference's first week of league play.
Tech and A&M are two of the contenders for the Big 12 South crown, and thei=
r
early showdown will help determine the pecking order.
Colorado is winless, but the Buffaloes have lost by narrow margins to three
very good teams and they are always tough in Boulder, so K-State probably
will have all it can handle after playing four patsies in a row to open the
season.

Recruiting Roundup
Texas has 16 commitments now after getting a pledge last week from Tyler CB
Aaron Ross, 6-1, 182, 4.42.
Ross, an outstanding man-for-man defender, said he had scholarship offers
from Alabama, Arkansas, Baylor, LSU, Oklahoma, Texas A&M and others, but sa=
id
he committed to Texas "because I've always been a Longhorn fan, and I reall=
y
like the Texas coaches."
He said Darryl Drake and Everett Withers were the two Texas coaches who
recruited him, and he said Withers, the Texas secondary coach, came to see
him play in his second game this season.
He is a big, fast corner with long arms, but don't look for him to get many
picks this year because he doesn't get many passes thrown his way because h=
e
is so good at tight man-for-man coverage.
I went to Waco Friday night to see the Lions play Tyler Lee. Waco LB Derric=
k
Johnson scored one touchdown on an 11-yard interception return and just
generally wreaked havoc on Lee's efforts to make a game of it.
Waco won, 34-9, and Johnson is as good a linebacker as I have seen in Texas
recently. He is 6-3 or 6-4, weighs around 205 and he can really run. He has
the frame to carry 230 pounds without losing any speed.
He says Texas is his No. 1 choice, but he also says he probably will take a=
ll
five official visits before making a decision.
Other schools in contention are A&M, FSU, Oklahoma and UCLA, but he says,
"I'd like to play pretty close to home so my friends and family could see m=
e
play."
His teammate, DT Sharod McGowan, is listed in the program as being 6-2 and
260. He doesn't look that heavy, but he is a dominating player, too, on
occasion.
McGowan is very quick and might be better suited to playing DE at the colle=
ge
level.He doesn't play with the same intensity as Johnson, but he can domina=
te
a game when he plays all out.
FB James Buchanon of Sarasota, Fla.,  and DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia HS in
Placentia, Cal., both took their official visits to Texas last weekend, and
their families said both had great times.
Buchanon was heading home Sunday night, but Jakes wasn't going back to
California until Monday morning.
Neither had committed as of Sunday night.
DE Eric Hall of Clarksville, Tenn., is the only other recruit who has taken
an official visit to Texas so far this year.
Other recruits who attended Saturday's game were OL William Winston of
Houston Madison, safeties Dewayne Brandon of Temple and Rufus Harris of La
Porte, and two top recruits who have already committed to Texas =01) super =
OL
Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter and DB/WR Brian Carter of The Woodlands. Th=
ey
were on unofficial visits.

Winston, who dominated Aldine's fine DE Lawrence Hooper when their two team=
s
met earlier this season, said, "He told me last year I was the best offensi=
ve
lineman he faced all year, and I wanted to be sure he didn't change his min=
d."
Winston said he enjoyed the game and getting to meet the Texas players and
coaches. "They have a classy operation with classy people," he said, adding
that UT, A&M, UCLA, Tennessee and LSU are his top five schools right now.
Here's a list of the Horns' 16 early commitments:
Offensive Line (7)
Jonathan Scott, 6-7, 290, 4.9, Dallas Carter
Abe Robinson, 6-6, 270, 4.9, Jersey Village
Alfio Randall, 6-6, 300, 5.1, Blinn JC
Mike Garcia, 6-5, 280, 5.2, Galena Park
Will Allen, 6-5, 300, 5.2, Cypress Falls
Roman Reeves, 6-6, 295, 5.2, Livingston
Terrance Young, 6-6, 340, 5.5, Longview

Cedric Benson, 5-11, 200, 4.5, Midland Lee

Braden Johnson, 6-2, 200, 4.5, Euless Trinity
Brian Carter, 5-11, 180, 4.5, The Woodlands

RECRUITING NOTES: QB Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch is not blessed wi=
th
great receivers this year, but his team is 4-0 and it defeated defending
private school state champion Houston St. Pius, 22-12 Saturday night, with
Nordgren running 14 yards for one TD and hitting a 13-yard pass for another=
.
He completed six of nine passes for 70 yards and ran four times for 21 yard=
s.
He says he will visit LSU and Kentucky the next two weekends, and probably
will be ready to commit to Texas by Oct. 15. . . Brent Rawls of Shreveport
Evangel, the other top QB Texas is pursuing, had an awesome game Thursday i=
n
a battle between Louisiana powers Evangel and and Shreveport Byrd. Rawls
completed 22 of 37 passes for 477 yards and three TDs and ran for 42 yards
and two more scores to lead Evangel to a 49-45 comeback victory. He visited
Purdue last weekend and will visit Florida State the Oct. 14 weekend. He al=
so
is considering LSU . . Midland Lee, which had won back-to-back state titles
in Texas, picked the wrong year to tangle with Louisiana powerhouse West
Monroe. Lee hung with West Monroe for a half before falling, 36-8. Benson,
who is running behind all all new offensive line (he is one of only two
starters back on offense), scored Lee's only TD when he broke loose for 78
yards on his third carry. He wound up with 151 yards on 23 carries and also
caught a 17-yard pass to account for most of the Rebels' yardage.

Softball Team Gets Big Pledge
Cat Osterman, a super 6-1 left-handed pitcher from Houston Cypress Springs,
has committed to play for the Longhorn women's softball team.
She said she will sign with Texas during the early signing period that begi=
ns
in November.
In adding to pitching for her high school, she was the ace pitcher last
summer for the Katy Cruisers team that won the national title for the ASA
18-and-under Gold Division, which was the top national group.
At the ASA National Tournament in St. Louis, she struck out 106 in 53 innin=
gs
and pitched one perfect game and one no-hitter while going 7-1 against the
top high school seniors and college freshmen in the country.
Osterman pitched against the U. S. Olympic team last summer while playing f=
or
the Katy Cruisers and struck out 11 of the 16 batters she faced while
allowing just one hit in five innings.
The Cruisers were the only team to take the Olympic team to extra innings,
losing 1-0 in eight innings.
The only other pitchers who struck out more Olympians were professional tea=
m
pitchers who went seven full innings, and none of them struck out more than
12.
Carol Adcock, Osterman's coach at Cypress Springs, said, "She could have go=
ne
anywhere she wanted. Every top softball program in the nation wanted her."
Adcock said Osterman compares favorably with former Longhorn All-American a=
nd
current Olympian Christa Williams at a comparable stage in their careers.
"Cat doesn't throw quite as hard as Christa did in high school," Adcock sai=
d,
"but she has more movement on her pitches. She is as dominating as any high
school pitcher I have seen."
Osterman had a 16-4 record last season at Cy Springs. She gave up only one
earned run during the season and had an ERA that looks like a misprint at
0.08.
Adcock said she struck out 377 in 169 innings last season, averaging 15.6
strikeouts per 7-inning game.
Adcock said, "Her best pitch is a rise ball. It's great, but she also has a
very good drop ball and a great curve."
UT softball coach Connie Clark can't comment on recruits until they sign, b=
ut
Osterman is clearly the kind of dominating pitcher she has been looking for
since Williams skipped her senior season to play on the Olympic team.
Osterman's final five schools were Texas, Stanford, Washington, Oklahoma an=
d
UCLA.
She also is an outstanding student who ranks in the top 10% in her class. S=
he
is dedicated, too. She was pitching to her dad in the family driveway when =
I
called her Sunday at 6:30 p.m. to confirm her commitment.

Top Pitcher Commits to UT
Luis Cortez, 5-11, 180, a hard-throwing right-handed pitcher with outstandi=
ng
control, has announced he will sign a baseball scholarship with the Longhor=
ns.
Cortez had a 0.82 ERA at Sinton last year and he played with a top AAU team=
,
the Ohio Thunder, this summer and went 4-0 with one save and a 0.91 ERA.
He was the youngest player on the Ohio Thunder and was one of only three
players on the team with remaining high school eligibility.
His best pitches are a slider and a fast ball that has been clocked as high
as 92 miles per hour, but is consistent in the 88-89 mph area. He also has =
a
good curve and a changeup.
He averaged two strikeouts per inning at Sinton last season.
Cortez also is an outstanding student. He makes straight A's and is fifth i=

his class.

Longhorns Getting Thinner at TE; Fall Signings Impressive

Coach Mack Brown said Wednesday TE Brock Edwards is questionable for the
Kansas game because his sore calf felt worse Wednesday than it did earlier
in
the week. As it stands now, he said Chad Stevens will start against Kansas
Saturday.
The Longhorns have had an incredible run of bad luck at TE. First, budding
star Bo Scaife tore an ACL on the first day of pre-season workouts. That
moved Mike Jones into the starting lineup and he, too, tore an ACL,
although
he did get to play in six games before incurring the injury. That moved
true
freshman Edwards, the only remaining scholarship TE, into the starting
lineup.
Stevens, a high school TE, had been moved to FB, but has moved back to TE
full time.
It was cold and rainy Tuesday and Wednesday in Austin and Brown said he was
happy about it because there is a very good chance it will be cold and
rainy
Saturday in Lawrence.

FOOTBALL RECRUITING NOTES: DT Marquise Hill, 6-6, 300, 5.0, of New Orleans
De
La Salle, says he will take an official visit to  Texas the Thanksgiving
weekend and wsill attend the Texas-A&M game. Hill is visiting LSU this
week,
Michigan the Dec. 1 weekend, Georgia the Dec. 8 weekend and Georgia Tech
the
Dec. 15 weekend. He said his big three are Michigan, LSU and Texas. . . The
Longhorns are still at 19 commitments and are still expected to wind up
with
25 or 26 signees.
* * * *
FALL SIGNING ROUNDUP
The Longhorns cleaned up on the first day of the fall signing period
Wednesday.
BASKETBALL RECRUITING NOTES: Point guard T.J. Ford, 5-11, 165, of Sugar
Land
Willowridge, and center Chris Wright, 6-10, 235, of Redwater, signed
basketball letters of intent with Texas Wednesday, the first day of the
fall
signing period.
Coach Rick Barnes said Ford is ranked as the nation's top point guard by
Bob
Gibbons' All-Star  Report and Wright is rated as the No. 25 prospect in the
country by Gibbons.
For those of you who like to keep up with future prospects, 6-7 Louisiana
star Derek Burditt of Marrero Ehret is the cousin of former Longhorn star
Albert Burditt. He is one of the nation's top juniors. The next great
player
in Texas might be 6-8 sophomore Kendrick Perkins of Beaumont Ozen. The
Longhorns are recruiting both these underclassmen.
* * * *
Texas women's coach Jody Conradt signed three players, including two  high
school All-Americans. Joining the Longhorn program next year will be 6-2
forward Kala Bowers of Woodward, Oklahoma , a USA Today and Street & Smith

QB-Athlete Kendal Briles Becomes Horns' 10th Commitment

No other state has  two players who produced almost 8,000 yards and nearly
100 touchdowns between them  last season, but Texas does, and UT has picked
up a commitment from one of them and has a good chance to get a pledge from
the other one this weekend.
QB Kendal Briles, 5-10, 175, 4.5, of Wollforth Frenship, said he called
coach
Mack Brown late Tuesday and told him he wanted to play for the Longhorns.
Briles led Stephenville to the Class 4A State Championship last year, but
moved to the Lubbock area when his father, Art Briles, who coached
Stephenville to three perfect 16-0 seasons and state titles in the '90s,
took
an assistant coaching job at Texas Tech.
"I called coach Brown last night and told him I was committing," Briles
said.
"I have always liked Texas. They have a great academic reputation and I'm
excited about playing for the Longhorns."
Briles was the Class 4A offensive player of the year and it is easy to
understand why when you look at his statistics. All he did last year
offensively was complete 207 of 356 passes for 3,115 yards and 28
touchdowns
and use his quick feet to run for 1,331 more yards and 16 more TDs. That's
an
incredible 4,446 yards of offense and an equally incredible 44 touchdowns.
The other half of that prolific duo is RB Cedric Benson, 5-11, 195, 4.4, of
Midland Lee, who ran for a Class 5A record 3,526 yards and another record
51
touchdowns last season in leading the Rebels to their second straight State
Championship.
Benson is flying to Austin Saturday  with his mother to meet with the UT
coaches. He is a long-time UT fan who says he wants to commit to a college
this summer so he can concentrate on his upcoming senior season.
I asked him if he will commit to Texas this weekend. He replied, "Maybe.
We'll see."
Benson also told me he runs a consistent 4.4 40 on grass and has run a 4.3
on
a track.
When you add their junior statistics, it comes out to 7,972 yards and 95
touchdowns. I don't think there have ever been two players in the Texas
high
school ranks, even in six-man footballs, where yardage and touchdowns are
the
name of the game, who have ever had offensive totals like that in a single
season. Class 5A and Class 4A include the largest schools in Texas, and
seasons like they had as juniors never happen  in those classifications.
Benson rushed for more than 2,000 yards his sophomore year in Lee's 15-1
championship season and led the Rebels to a perfect 16-0 season in 1999.
Briles, who became the Longhorns' 10th early commitment, turned down an
offer
to be an option quarterback at Nebraska to be a safety at Texas. He
attended
summer camps at both schools before selecting the Longhorns. It was a wise
choice if he wants a chance to play in the NFL. There are some starting
5-10
defensive backs in the NFL, but there are no starting 5-10 quarterbacks.
The Longhorns other commitments include MLB Yamil Lebron of Killeen
Ellison,
OLs Mike Garcia of Galena Park (who switched from A&M to Texas), Jonathan
Scott of Dallas Carter, Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village, Roman
Reeves
of Livingston, Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls and Alfio Randall of
Blinn
JC and DBs Braden Johnson of Euless Trinity and Brian Carter of The
Woodlands.
* * * *
QB Quon Cosby of Mart is another 5-10 signal caller who will move to the
defensive backfield in college. He visited Texas last Wednesday and talked
to
Brown and several UT assistant coaches. He said the Longhorn coaches
offered
him a scholarship and told him they want him to be a cornerback and kick
returner. In leading Mart to the Class 2A state title last year, Cosby
passed
for 1,328 yards and 17 TDs, ran for 1,510 yards and 27 scores and had nine
kick returns for TDs. That's 53 TDs for this explosive young man, who lists
Texas No. 1.
* * * *
UT junior center Chris Mihm was the No. 7 pick in the NBA draft Wednesday
by
the Chicago Bulls, who then swapped him to Cleveland for No. 8 pick Jamal
Crawford of Michigan and an undisclosed amount of money. The Bulls had two
of
the first seven picks in the draft. They had been expected to pick Mihm No.
4, but they went instead for Big 12 Player of the Year Marcus Fizer of Iowa
State. Forward Kenyon Martin of Cincinnati was the No. 1 pick by the New
York
Nets, followed by LSU forward Stromile Swife at No. 2 by the Vancouver
Grizzlies. The Los Angeles Clippers picked third and took East St. Louis
high
school star Darius Miles. Picking fifth, Orlando chose Florida forward Mike
Miller, and Atlanta took DerMarr Johnson, another Cincinnati player, at No.
6.

Horns Favored by 19, but Brown Predicts Close Game Saturday

The Longhorns are 19 points over Oklahoma State Saturday in their Big 12
Conference opener that will kick off at 11 a.m. and will be televised over
much of the nation by ABC, but coach Mack Brown said Wednesday he expects a
close game that won't be decided until the fourth quarter.
He said Oklahoma State has the best defense Texas has faced this year, and
he
said 230-pound RB Reggie White, who is averaging 127 yards per game
rushing,
"is the best running back we've seen."
With All-Big 12 DT Shaun Rogers likely to miss the game with a sprained
ankle
and freshman backup Stevie Lee out for about six weeks with a broken bone
in
his foot that required surgery and the insertion of a pin, Brown said the
Longhorns don't have much depth at defensive tackle.
He said sophomore Cole Pittman, a former tackle who was starting at end,
has
been moved back to tackle. Redshirt freshman Marcus Tubbs, who played well
against Houston after Rogers was injured, will start alongside All-American
Casey Hampton, with Pittman and little-used junior Miguel McKay as the
backups.
I asked Brown if Lee might get a medical redshirt, since he was hurt so
early
in the season, and he said Lee is eligible for one if he isn't able to play
again this season. If he gets a medical redshirt, he would be a freshman in
eligibility again next year.
For those of you who are curious about what it takes to get a medical
redshirt, Brown said a player is eligible for a medical redshirt if he
incurs
a season-ending injury before the fourth game if he has played in less than
20% of the plays. Lee was injured in the second game and, as a backup
tackle,
had not played in 20% of the plays. Brown said if  Lee does recover in time
to play late this season, he would not be eligible for a medical redshirt.
Brown said the Longhorn defense, which was outstanding in Saturday's 48-0
rout of Houston, had an average day in practice Tuesday, "but they played
better today."
He said he has told the defense "that they need to understand Reggie White
is
the best running back we've seen this year, and, with Stevie Lee out and
we're not sure about Shaun Rogers, it really hurts our depth."
Brown said the team goal is to "get 100 rushing yards and hold them under
100
yards rushing."
Defensive coordinator Carl Reese said Kalen Thornton will start at DE in
place of Pittman. Thornton will be the first true freshman to start for the
Longhorns this season.
Reese also was asked if Tubbs, who had two sacks against Houston in his
first
extended action, is better as a pass rusher than as a run defender. "He's
about the same guy in there," Reese said. "He's a big guy with good
athletic
ability and he played at a high level against Houston. We need to him to
play
at the same high level Saturday."
Because of OSU's running ability, Reese also said his strong-side
linebackers, Tyrone Jones and Marcus Wilkins, will get to play a lot more
Saturday than they have been playing. Reese pulls his strong backers and
plays an extra defensive back against passing teams, but he said the strong
backers "might get to play as much as 70% of the time Saturday."
Of course, Cowboy QB Tony Lindsay is dangerous running and throwing, and,
if
he gets hot through the air, that could change Reese's plans.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: QB Brent Rawls, 6-5, 195, 4.7, of Shreveport Evangel, is
taking his official visit to Texas this weekend and his parents are coming,
too. Rawls, the top QB in Louisiana, went to Purdue last weekend, and he
plans to visit Florida State the Oct. 14 weekend. He also is interested in
Clemson, Arkansas and LSU.
* * * *
BASEBALL RECRUITING: The Longhorn baseball team  got a commitment Tuesday
from catcher Curtis Thigpen, 5-11, 175, of Forney. He hit .515 as a junior
and is an outstanding defensive catcher. He also had offers from Alabama,
Baylor and Texas A&M.

I'm sorry, baby.  I wish it wasn't the case.  The excuse is that he can't
find a hotel room on such short notice.  Also, Em and Ray are moving in
together and we're not at that step yet.  I'm not excusing the situation.
Besides, there really isn't any room for him-he's going to have to sleep on
the floor.  I wouldn't want you to sleep on the floor.

Love you,
Jenn

 DT Lyle Sendlein Commits to Longhorns

 Lyle Sendlein says he has known since he was a small child that he wanted
 to
 play football at Texas, so he said a new NCAA rule interpretation that
 prohibits recruits committing while at a summer camp was no problem at
 all.
 "The mini-camp was today (Sunday), so I just called them Saturday and
 committed," he said. "When they told me about the new rule, I just decided
 to
 take care of it in advance. I knew I was going to play for the Longhorns,
 so
 I didn't have any problem committing before I got here for the camp."
 Sendlein was being recruited by all the top schools in the Pac 10, plus
 Notre
 Dame, Nebraska, Michigan and Penn State.
 Coach Mack Brown said one of the Longhorns' top recruiting goals this year

 was to sign several top defensive linemen, and, while he can't comment on
 individual recruits,  Sendlein is an outstanding defensive line prospect.
 Sendlein said he was measured at the camp and came in at a shade over 6-4,

 and he said he weighed in at 263. He also said he clocked a 5.0 in the 40,

 "but it seemed like the times were all a little slow. I usually run 4.8 or

 4.9." He is quick enough that he plays middle linebacker for Scottsdale
 Chaparral, the Arizona big school state champion two years running after
 going 14-0 in 1999 and 2000.
 Sendlein brings to four the number of early commitments. DT Sonny Davis,
 who
 committed to Texas right out of Austin Lanier, is in junior college in
 Mississippi and says he still plans to come to Texas when he graduates
 from
 the JC. That would put him on schedule to come in with next February's
 signees.
 OL Brett Valdez of Brownwood and DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos, two of
 the
 state's top prospects, also have committed to Texas. The Longhorns plan to

 sign only three offensive linemen and Valdez was the first one they
 offered.
 They hope to get the other two from a threesome that includes Jeff Lebby
 of
 Andrews, Tony Ugoh of Houston Westfield and Justin Blaylock of Plano East.

 Lebby and Blaylock attended Sunday's UT mini-camp.
 Anderson is No. 3 and Valdez is No. 23 on my 25-man "difference-maker"
 list.
 Davis was in my top five his senior year and Sendlein would be in my top
 10
 this year if he played in Texas. In other words, this is a great quartet
 to
 start the UT recruiting bandwagon rolling.
 DT Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings, DE Travis Leitko of The Woodlands
 and
 WR Anthony Wright of Klein Forest, the top players in the state at their
 respective positions, also attended the UT mini-camp Sunday. I talked to
 all
 of them tonight and they all  like Texas, but they also are considering
 several other schools and all three  said they probably will not commit to

 anyone this summer. I like the Longhorns chances with both Wrights, but I
 think Leitko is so wide open that he could wind up at any of the five
 schools
 he is considering (UT, A&M, Stanford, Michigan and Notre Dame).
 Texas A&M also had a mini-camp Sunday and Aggie reporters were saying no
 one
 at the camp was likely to get an offer at this point, so it would appear
 that
 the cream of the state's recruiting crop showed up in Austin. I know
 Leitko,
 Lebby, Blaylock, and both Wrights had offers from Texas before they came
 to
 the camp Sunday.
 * * * *
 The NCAA edict that prevents recruits from accepting scholarships while at
 a
 summer camp is strange because there are no new rules relating to camps.
 It
 seems that some NCAA bureaucrat just gave a new interpretation based on a
 rule that that has been around for several years.
 * * * *
 FOOTBALL NOTES: Lindy's, the first reputable national college football
 magazine I have seen this year, picks Chris Simms as the third best QB in
 the
 country and the best one in the Big 12. If he lives up to that hype, I
 think
 we can all buy our plane tickets to Pasadena. With the receivers the
 Longhorns have in stock, a great quarterback would make the Texas offense
 too
 tough to handle by anyone on the schedule. To reach that level, Simms will

 need to be much improved  at looking off his receivers and much better at
 throwing the ball away at times instead of forcing it into double
 coverage. .
 . Super RB recruit Cedric Benson of Midland Lee is already in Austin
 working
 out and getting ready for the season.

Scouting Texas Tech

Texas travels to Lubbock Saturday to take on dangerous Texas Tech in a 6 p.=
m.
game that will be televised by the Fox Network.
The Red Raiders are 6-3 overall and 2-3 in the Big 12, with losses to
Nebraska, Kansas State and Texas A&M.
Tech, under new coach Mike Leach, opened the season with a 24-3 win over Ne=
w
Mexico, then whipped Utah State, 38-16, and North Texas, 13-7, before
wrapping up the non-conference slate with a 26-0 shutout of
Lousiana-Lafayette.
The Raiders fell at Texas A&M, 33-15, to open league play. Then they
whitewashed Baylor, 28-0, before getting hammered by Nebraska, 56-3. Then
they scared Kansas State in Manhattan before falling, 28-23.
They outscored Kansas, 45-39, Saturday in Lawrence, with sophomore QB Kliff
Kingsbury hitting WR Derek Dorris for four touchdowns.
Leach is the guy who found Josh Heupel and lured him to Oklahoma last seaso=
n
when he was the Sooners' offensive coordinator.
The Sooners' offensive success last year propeled him to the head job at
Texas Tech and his offense is a pass first, pass second and pass third
offense, just like the one the Sooners use.
The difference, however, is that there is only one Heupel. But Kingsbury is
very good. He's a sophomore who has thrown a nation's leading 431 passes th=
is
year and who has hit 60.1% of them.
He is No. 8 in the nation in total offense, averaging 285.6 yards per game.
One scary statistic is Texas Tech's lofty No. 2 ranking in pass defense. Th=
e
Raiders are giving up only 146.2 yards per game passing and they have
intercepted 10 passes.
If the Longhorns don't run any better than they have been running, they wil=
l
have to have some success throwing to have a chance to win.
One other worrisome thing is that Texas Tech is the second best team the
Longhorns have played to this point. Oklahoma, with a 7-0 record, is the on=
ly
other team the Horns have played with a winning record right now.
To win in Lubbock, the Longhorns have to pressure Kingsbury and the offense
and defense both have to remember to show up in the first quarter.

Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):

Texas                             Texas Tech
Offense

Big 12 Roundup

The conference races have narrowed down to three teams in each division and
the Northern Division will come down to just two teams after this week
because Iowa State travels to Kansas State in an elimination game.
Two huge games are on tap next week when Oklahoma visits Texas A&M and
Nebraska travels to Kansas State. If the Sooners and Huskers both win, the
races are as good as over and you can count on them meeting again in Kansas
City on December 2.

Recruiting Roundup

The Longhorns are still at 19 commitments and are headed toward another
national top 10 class, and possibly a top five class if things break right =
at
the end.
* * * *
Longhorn prize recruit Cedric Benson had 27 carries for 313 yards and all
three touchdowns on runs of 4, 22 and 82 yards to lead Midland Lee past
arch-rival Odessa Permian, 19-0. It was his sixth career 300-yard game.
Benson has rushed for 7,121 yards, the 10th highest total ever for a Texas
high school player and the best ever for one in the state's highest
classification.
He won't have the awesome stats he had last year (3,500 yds, 51 TDs) becaus=
e
he is one of two offensive starters left from Lee's great back-to-back stat=
e
championship teams, but he looks even bigger and faster this year than he w=
as
last year.
T. J. Mills, Permian's coach, said, "My kids hit him and hit him and hit hi=
m,
but he's a load. If you don't get a lot of hats on him on every play, he'll
hurt you."
Don Shows, the highly successful coach at West Monroe, La., had much the sa=
me
thing to say after his team mauled Lee, 38-6, in an early-season game.
Lee's lone TD came on a 78-yard run by Benson, and it came on the third pla=
y
of the game. Shows, whose teams are 89-3 since 1995, said, "We don't usuall=
y
give up runs like that, and we stopped him pretty good most of the time. Bu=
t
our game plan was to have a lot of people on him on every play, and even
then, he made some tough, tough yardage. He's a hard back to stop, especial=
ly
if he gets a little room."
* * * *
Not much has changed in the last week. The Longhorns are still waiting on
several key players to make their decisions.
They will sign six to seven more players, and several of the remaining
scholarships are likely to go to  S Dewayne Brandon of Temple, LB Derrick
Johnson of Waco, DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia, Cal., and DE Jonathan Jackson
and TE James Moses, both of Galena Park North Shore.
They fill the key requirements: they like the Horns and the Horns like them=
.
The most important recruit remaining is super DT Tommie Harris of Killeen
Ellison, and others still considering Texas are  Athletes Quan Cosby of Mar=
t
and Joseph Addai of Houston Sharpstown and OLs William Winston of Houston
Madison and Jami Hightower of Jacksonville.
Super DT Paul Broussard of Blinn JC is still a possibility, but he has some
academic hurdles.
The Longhorns have as good a chance as anyone with Harris, but he says he i=
s
still considering six or seven schools and says he is wide open.
Harris said he came to the Missouri game Oct. 21 but got there late and
didn't get to visit with the other recruits. Harris said he had a good time
and said Texas remains one of his top choices.

RECRUITING NOTES: Fullback James Buchanon of Sarasota, Fla., picked Florida
State over Texas and Boston College. . . One top UT recruit, OL Mike Garcia
of Galena Park, is out for the rest of the season with a torn ACL, but he
says he will be ready for two-a-days next August in Austin.

Part 2 of 3 Parts

Big Recruiting Push Will Start at June Summer Camps

The Longhorns are being very selective in making offers to recruits so far
this spring, but that will change next month when they host some of the top
blue chippers at their summer camps.
The Aggies have two commitments to the Longhorns' one pledge from my 25 man
"difference-maker" list on page 4, but that will all change in June.
Coach Mack Brown is the one who invented early recruiting in Texas, and he
did it through his June camps.
That hasn't changed. The only thing that has changed is that the Aggies went
out in March and April and gave offers to about 30 kids.
There's nothing wrong with that, and I am not knocking their strategy.
But Brown's strategy works and there is no reason for him to change it. If
you look at the last three February signing days, you'll know why he doesn't
need to change it.
Meanwhile, the Horns got one offensive lineman they wanted when they got a
pledge from terrific run blocker Bret Valdez of Brownwood.
The Aggies got commitments last week from center Bob Morton of McKinney, the
guy I have rated as the best offensive lineman in the state, and L'Tydrick
Riley of Crockett, the top recruit in the state in the "athlete" category.
Texas probably would have offered Riley a scholarship at some point if he had
not committed to A&M, but the Longhorn coaches did not recruit Morton as hard
as they are recruiting several other offensive linemen in the state.
I think when the dust settles in February the Longhorns will have another
great class signed and ready for delivery.
They got 10 commitments last June en route to a national top five recruiting
class, and they probably will have close to that number at the end of June
this year.
Most of those commitments last June were from big offensive linemen who were
just what the Longhorns needed.
Several of them this June could be from big defensive linemen, and that's
where the Longhorns need to load up this season.
DT Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale, Arizona, younger brother of current UT LB
Austin Sendlein and son of former UT and pro LB Robin Sendlein, told me he
probably will commit to Texas when he attends the Longhorns' early June camp.
He is the top recruit in Arizona and is being heavily recruited by top
schools all over the country.
DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos also plans to attend a UT camp next month and
he is another possibility for an early commitment. In a year when the state
is loaded with top defensive line prospect, he is a star among stars.
The best DT of them all, however, is Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings. He
probably won't commit early, but he likes the Longhorns.
Wright is a 300-pounder with outstanding quickness, and he does the best job
of staying low and collapsing the line of scrimmage of anyone I have seen in
the nation.
If Texas can sign Wright, Anderson, Sendlein and Kasey Studdard of Highlands
Ranch, Colo., they will be set at defensive tackle, and they have the inside
track with all four of them.
Studdard is the son of former UT and Denver Bronco offensive line star David
Studdard.
Anderson, like Keller DT Tully Janszen, is a super quick starter who could
play end or tackle in college.
At DE, the top guy in Texas is Travis Leitko of The Woodlands. He is a super
student who is pretty wide open, but he likes the Longhorns and he also is
friends with redshirt freshman QB Chance Mock and incoming freshman WR-DB
Brian Carter, two Longhorns who are former Woodlands' stars.
Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel, brother of Cole Pittman, who was
expected to contend for a starting job at DT with Texas this year before
being killed in a tragic auto accident, also is an outstanding DE prospect
who is, like Leitko, very quick and very physical. He is strongly considering
Texas.
The coaches also want a super quick DE, and their best hope in Texas might be
Nick Owino of Alief Elsik. They also are trying to get in on Zack Latimer,
who led Colorado in sacks last year with 24 at Aurora Gateway. But Latimer is
All-State in both football and basketball, and could opt for the latter in
college.
Owino and Latimer are the kind of outside speed rushing defensive ends the
Longhorn coaches have been seeking since they arrived at Texas.
* * * *
The two fastest junior football players in the state are also two of the best
ones. And that's no coincidence because you can't tackle something you can't
catch.
RB DaBryan Blanton of Forney broke the sprint records in Class 3A with a
smoking 20.37 in the 200 meters and a 10.3 in the 100 meters.
Not since the days of Roy Martin a quarter century ago have I seen a high
school sprinter run a 200 meters like that.
The times at the state meet are all fully automatic, which makes them
officially .24 seconds slower than hand times. In the old hand-timed days, he
would have had a 20.13.
He also anchored Forney's 400-meter relay team to victory in 41.1.
Blanton is an outstanding running back, but he probably will be a wide
receiver or defensive back in college. He is pretty wide open on his college
choices, but he is considering Texas.
CB Edorian McCullough of North Garland won thge 5A 100 in 10.32, finished
second in the 200 in 21 flat and anchored his team's 400-meter relay team to
second place, making up a lot of ground to pull from fourth to second.
McCullough was undefeated in the 100 meters this year. He is a top RB-CB
prospect who favors Texas over Oklahoma.
* * * *
The talent level in Texas this year is very high. About 20 Texas players have
been listed on one or more national 100 groupings, and there are some other
outstanding players who are equally talented, but who are not as well known
yet.
One interesting factor this year is geography. In most year, the Houston area
has most of the really elite prospects.
Houston is very strong at the top again, with the top two and three of the
top five players on my "difference-maker" list on page 4.
But the Dallas-Fort Worth area runs deeper in talent this year than the
Houston-Gulf Coast area, with a 10-6 edge on my list of the top 25.
The other nine players on the list include four from East Texas, three from
West Texas and two from the Austin area.
The talent runs very deep at defensive tackle and defensive end this year for
the first time since Brown and his staff arrived in Austin.
There also are some big linebackers, like Glenn Jackson of Carrollton Turner,
who are big-framed guys who already weigh 200 and might grow into 250-pound
defensive ends in college.
Jackson runs a 4.6 and is an outstanding pass rusher from the corner.
There also is a lot of talent at quarterback, and if a school misses on a top
signal caller in this recruiting class, there are a pair of kids who will be
juniors this season who already have college recruiters salivating.
They are James Battle, 6-2, 190, 4.6, who ran Recruiting . . (continued from
page 5)
and passed a Denton Ryan team that was 1-9 in 1999 deep into the Class 4A
playoffs last year, and Devon Williams, 6-3, 185, 4.5, of Arlington Houston,
a quick-footed runner with a powerful arm.
Both will be top national recruits next year.
The Longhorns also want to sign a great running back every year and, while
the class of running backs doesn't run very deep, Albert Hardy of Galena Park
is a power runner deluxe with fine speed, and he likes the Longhorns.
There are some very good wide receivers in Texas this year, but the best one
I have seen on tape is Marquis Johnson of Champaign, Ill. If he played in
Texas, he would be high in my top 25 and would be easily the No. 1 wide
receiver.
He likes the Longhorns, and super UT recruiter Tim Brewster was in Champaign
last week to visit his high school. He only lives three blocks from the
Illinois campus, so let's hope he has a yen to travel.
He is a big, physical receiver who has speed, moves and great hands.
There is one receiver in Texas I haven't seen play, but I have heard good
things about him and I saw him run a fine leg on Klein Forest's third-place
1,600-meter relay team at the state meet.
He is Anthony Wright, another big guy with speed who has a reputation for
being physical. I plan to see him play in early September and might move him
up on the list after that.
Texas needs to sign a tight end, too, and it will be an uphill fight to land
Eric Winston of Midland Lee, who is easily the top one in the state. He comes
from an Aggie family, but says he will consider Texas, too.

Horns 3rd in Baseball, Play Ags

Texas wound up third in the Big 12 baseball race and will play No. 6-seed
Texas A&M Wednesday at 10 a.m. in Oklahoma City in the first round of the
conference tournament.
Texas finished 19-11 in the Big 12 and 34-22 overall. The Aggies were 15-15
in conference play and 30-26 overall.
The Longhorns beat the Aggies twice in Austin and lost to them once in
College Station during the regular season.
The winner of the UT-A&M game will play the winner of a game between No. 2
Texas Tech and No. 7 Oklahoma at 5 p.m. Thursday in a game that will be
televised by College Sports Southwest.
The loser of the UT-A&M will play the loser of the Tech-OU game at 10 a.m.
Thursday in an elimination game.
The third-place finish was the Longhorns' highest placing in the five years
of the Big 12's existence.

Longhorns Bounce Back, Trample Buffaloes
Behind Great Defense, Solid Offense

The Longhorns followed their worst game of the Mack Brown era with a great
defensive effort and a solid offensive performance in a 28-14 win over
Colorado in Boulder Saturday afternoon.
The game really wasn't as close as the score indicates. Texas outgained
Colorado, 474 to 133, and the Buffaloes ran only six plays in Texas' end of
the field all day. The Buffs ran 72 plays and they  either gained nothing o=
r
took a loss on 38 of them.
The defense held Colorado to 22 yards total offense in the first half and
would have had a shutout except for a pair of fumbles that gave the Buffs a
touchdown and set up their other score.
Texas is now 4-2 for the year and 2-1 in the Big 12. Colorado fell to 1-5
overall and 1-2 in conference play.
This was a real gut-check game for Texas after the 63-14 whipping at the
hands of Oklahoma the previous week, and the Longhorns responded with their
best defensive effort in terms of yardage yielded in 12 years and their bes=
t
rushing yardage total of the season.
The offense did struggle in the red zone, and Hodges Mitchell, who hadn't
fumbled all year, fumbled on a  running play and a Colorado linebacker pick=
ed
it up and returned it for a touchdown. Mitchell also fumbled a punt to set =
up
the other Colorado score.
But he ran for 125 tough yards and scored the clinching touchdown on a pass
from Major Applewhite, who threw for three touchdowns and 308 yards.
Here, briefly, is how the game went:
FIRST QUARTER
Colorado won the toss and took the ball. Big mistake. Texas got the wind an=
d
the Buffs wound up playing deep in their own territory throughout the first
half because the fierce Texas defense kept sacking freshman QB Craig Ochs a=
nd
forcing turnovers. That gave the  Longhorn offense great field position, wi=
th
UT's first five possessions, extending well into the second quarter, starti=
ng
at midfield or in Colorado territory. Texas' first drive started at the Buf=
f
42 and got to the 17 before Kris Stockton's attempt at a 34-yard field goal
sailed wide left. Their next possession began at the CU 45, and got to the =
8
before Applewhite fumbled and the Buffs recovered. The third and final UT
possession in the quarter started at the Texas 46 and ended at the Colorado
45. The Longhorns owned the statistics for the quarter, leading 5-2 in firs=
t
downs and 71-20 in total offense. Colorado never crossed its 33-yard line i=
n
the entire period.
SECOND QUARTER
The fourth Longhorn possession started at the Colorado 45, and this time th=
e
offense scored in two plays. First, Applewhite found true freshman WR B. J.
Johnson streaking down the right sideline for 39 yards to the Buffalo 6, th=
en
he hit his other true freshman receiver, Roy Williams, for the touchdown.
Williams outfought a Colorado defender for the ball and the score. Stockton=
's
kick gave Texas a 7-0 lead only 40 seconds deep in the quarter. LB Everick
Rawls intercepted Ochs' pass on the first play after the kickoff and return=
ed
it to the Colorado 29. But the Horns couldn't move and Stockton's attempted
45-yard field goal sailed wide right. The Longhorns started their next
possession at their own 35 =01) the worst field possession they had experie=
nced
to this point =01) and Applewhite hit Johnson for 10 yards, then found TE M=
ike
Jones for 23 more yards to the Colorado 31. The Horns stalled at the Buff 8
and Stockton booted a 30-yard field goal to stretch UT's lead to 10-0 with
7:21 left. Mitchell got loose on a 19-yard punt return to the CU 32 later i=
n
the quarter. Applewhite hit Johnson to the 21, and Mitchell ran to the 12,
but a fumbled snap on a third-and-1 brought Stockton in to kick another
30-yard FG to boost the lead to 13-0 with 1:14 left. Colorado had nine
possessions in the first half and had minus yardage on six of them. The Buf=
fs
had only 22 yards at the half and just two first downs.
THIRD QUARTER
The Longhorns were moving again to start the second half when disaster
struck. Mitchell was hit  as he took a handoff and the ball came loose.
Colorado LB Jashon Sykes scooped it up and ran it back 50 yards for a
touchdown. The kick was good and UT's lead was cut to 13-7 with 12:18 left.
Texas couldn't make a first down, and the Buffs drove into Texas territory
for the first time before punting to the UT 5. The Horns had failed to scor=
e
from point-blank range in the early going, but they covered the 95 yards in
just five plays. Mitchell got 10 on a draw play, then Applewhite threw an
incompletion. Mitchell bounced another draw play to the outside and ran 18
yards to the 33. Applewhite found Jones open again and hit him for 25 yards
to the CU 42. Williams got a step on his defender and Applewhite hit him fo=
r
the touchdown. The Horns went for two and Williams, who was well covered,
tipped the ball away from the defender and caught it as it came down to giv=
e
the Horns a 21-7 lead with 6:30 left. Redshirt freshman safety Dakarai
Pearson intercepted Ochs' long throw on the next play and ran it back to th=
e
Colorado 43. But the Horns couldn't make a first down and had to punt. The =
UT
defense forced a quick Colorado punt, but Mitchell bobbled the ball at the =
UT
26 and Colorado recovered. A personal foul against Texas moved it to the 13
and Colorado TB Cortlen Johnson, who had been bottled up all day, got outsi=
de
the defenders and scored to cut the UT lead to 21-14 with 2:37 left. At the
end of the third quarter, the Horns were clinging to a one touchdown lead
despite having a 402-91 edge in net yardage.
FOURTH QUARTER
Neither team could mount a threat early in the quarter, but Texas, starting
from its own 19 with 9:22 left, finally put the game away and used up nearl=
y
four minutes doing it. Applewhite hit 6 of 7 passes for 62 yards in the
drive, including a short pass to Mitchell on third-and-4 that he broke for =
a
42-yard scoring jaunt. That gave Texas a 28-14 lead with 5:36 left. Neither
team threatened again.

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday the 28-14 victory at Colorado Saturday "was on=
e
of the best games we've had since we've been here."
"It's a little disappointing that we didn't get the shutout because the
defense played shutout football," he said.
He said his young defensive ends "played their best game as a group." True
freshman DE Kalen Thornton had two sacks and sophomore DE Cory Redding also
had a sack..
"Cory had his best game," Brown said, "and Kalen is very mature. He played
really well yesterday and made some impact plays."
Brown also said QB Major Applewhite, in his first game since being named th=
e
starter, "played well. He made some big plays for us."
He said DT Shaun Rogers, who had missed two straight games with a sprained
ankle, played 41 plays against Colorado and appears to be ready for full-ti=
me
duty again.
"We need Shaun in there," Brown said. "He's just one of the premier footbal=
l
players in America."
He said the team went back to the same basic offense it used during Ricky
Williams' Heisman Trophy year.
"We were in two-backs a lot more than in one-back," he said. "It's easier t=
o
protect (the passer)  with two backs. When you are running the football, th=
e
safeties have to come in and get involved in the running game. Then you can
hit the tight end. Then, when they get concerned with the tight end, that
lets you get 1-on-1 with your receivers."
He said  that was the reason TE Mike Jones was able to get open so easily.
Jones caught six passes for 102 yards to lead the Longhorn receivers. He al=
so
became only the fourth tight end in school history to post a 100-yard
receiving day.
Brown said the UT offensive line had its best game of the year. "Our two
tackles, Mike Williams and Leonard Davis, really played well," he said.
Brown also said redshirt freshman OG Tillman Holloway, who came in when
Antwan Kirk-Hughes was injured, "came in and was really physical."
He also said Major Applewhite remains the starting quarterback.
INJURY NOTES: Brown said  Kirk-Hughes hurt his shoulder and is the only
player who appears likely to miss any practice time this week. He said DE
Kalen Thornton, who was hurt during the game, "is fine. He got stepped on o=
r
kicked, but he's fine."

Colorado Game Notes . .

* Texas snapped its six-game losing streak to Colorado. The Longhorns last
defeated the Buffaloes on Dec. 27, 1975, a 38-21 triumph in the Bluebonnet
Bowl. The game Saturday also marked UT's first victory in Boulder since Sep=
t.
27, 1941 (34-6).
* The victory also snapped a five-game losing streak in games played away
from Royal Memorial Stadium.
* Texas improved to 18-0 when recording more than 400 yards of total offens=
e
under Mack Brown.
* The Longhorns improved to 18-0 when outrushing their opponent during
Brown's tenure.
* UT allowed only 133 total yards, which was its best defensive effort sinc=
e
1988 when New Mexico was held to 66 yards offensively.
* WRs B. J. Johnson and Roy Williams became the first true freshman receive=
r
tandem to start for Texas since Mike Adams and Lovell Pinkney did so agains=
t
Texas A&M on Nov. 26, 1992.
* Williams set the Texas' freshman single-season touchdown record with his
two scoring receptions in the contest (6, 42 yards). Williams, who has four
scoring catches this season, broke fellow teammate Artie Ellis' (2000) and
Lovell Pinkney's (1992) record of three. The pair of touchdown receptions
tied the UT freshman single-game record held by Ellis (Sept. 9, vs.
Louisiana-Lafayette).
* Johnson's four receptions pushed his season total to 17 and he moved into
fourth place on UT's freshman single-season receptions chart.
* TE Mike Jones had a career-high six receptions for a career-best 102 yard=
s
(previous: 3 receptions for 36 yards, at Stanford, Sept. 16, 2000). It is
only the fourth time in school history that a tight end has posted at least
100 receiving yards in a game and the first since Kerry Cash had seven
receptions for 104 yards on Nov. 3, 1990, at Texas Tech (a span of 119
games).
* QB Major Applewhite threw for more than 300 yards for a school-record
eighth time in his career (previous: 7, by James Brown, 1994-97). He also h=
ad
at least three touchdown passes for the 10th time during his career
(including bowl games).
* RB Hodges Mitchell had 125 rushing yards and moved into 13th place on
Texas' all-time list. Mitchell now has rushed for 1,884 yards during his
career.

Basketball Fan Jam

All fans are invited to meet the Texas men's and women's basketball teams
Saturday at the second annual "Texas Basketball Fan Jam."
Fan Jam takes the place of UT's previous "midnight madness" celebration whi=
ch
traditionally kicked off the start of basketball season.
The Fan Jam, located in the grassy area/parking lot in the North End Zone o=
f
Memorial Stadium, will take place three hours prior to the 1:30 p.m.
Texas-Missouri football game kickoff, and will conclude one hour prior to
kickoff.
At the Fan Jam, Longhorn fans are invited to meet and greet all the Texas'
players and coaches.
There will be an opportunity to get autographs from players and coaches, pl=
us
schedule cards, and there are games and giveaways for all in attendance.
Admission is free.

Stronger Defense, Improved Punting, Explosive Offense Give Horns Chance to
Stay in Top 10

With two-a-day workouts almost over and the opening game just around the
corner, there is some great news for Longhorn football fans.
That 17-year absence from the final top 10 could be over for three big
reasons:
1.The defense looks even stronger than last year's unit, which ranked No. 6
nationally.
2. Kris Stockton is punting so strongly that coach Mack Brown says the pros
are interested.
3. The offense, which couldn't score in the final ten quarters of last
season, is so explosive that it should be able to score on anybody.
But let's temper that great news with a word or two of caution about the
offense. While it is capable of breaking a long touchdown play against anyo=
ne
on the schedule, it still doesn't look like an offense that can make long,
time-consuming drives against a quality opponent.
It won't be as quick to punt or score as the offenses at the really
pass-happy schools on the schedule this year, but there might be a scary
number of three-and-outs against good defenses.
That won't necessarily be fatal to the Longhorns' high hopes, if the offens=
e
and special teams can avoid costly mistakes that leave the defense a short
field to defend.
The Longhorn defensive unit is so strong that it will force most teams to
punt quickly, too.
Another great asset this season will be defensive depth. When the Longhorn
offense sputtered down the stretch last year, the defenders sometimes simpl=
y
wore down through repeated exposure.
But the second defensive unit has been formidable in practice. It allowed t=
he
No. 1 offense one touchdown in seven possessions in Saturday's scrimmage.
Brown said the only big difference in the first and second units is at
defensive tackle, where the first team has All-American Casey Hampton and a
guy the pros like even better, Shaun Rogers.
But Rogers says the dropoff at tackle isn't that great when the second unit
comes in. "When Casey and I come out, Stevie (Lee) and Marcus (Tubbs) are
really good young players who are just going to keep on getting better and
better."
While Hampton and Rogers are seniors, Lee is a true freshman, who enrolled =
in
January so he could go through spring practice, and Tubbs is a redshirt
freshman who came to Texas as a tight end before growing into a formidable
defensive tackle.
The Longhorns are still a very young team, with  Hampton, Rogers and free
safety Greg Brown the only senior starters on defense, and tackles Leonard
Davis and Cory Quye the only likely senior starters on defense. Stockton, w=
ho
will handle the punting and place kicking, also is a senior.
Brandon Healy is starting at wide receiver now, but the fifth-year senior i=
s
being pushed by the heralded freshmen, who are developing rapidly.
Let's take a look at what the Longhorn offense did last year and what it
meant to the team. The figures below show game-by-game rushing, passing and
total offense yardage, plus the number of sacks the opponents garnered.

It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that the Longhorns were 7-0 when
they had more than 400 yards offensively and an even more impressive 8-0 wh=
en
they had 100 yards net rushing.
The flip side of that coin is that they were 2-5 when they had less than 40=
0
yards offensively and an ever worse 1-5 when they had less than 100 yards n=
et
rushing.
They also had five games in which they gave up more than four sacks and the
only one of those they won was against Texas Tech.
To keep history from repeating itself, the Horns need to start percolating =
on
offense.
Now, let's look at the upcoming season. Coach Brown doesn't mind the
pollsters picking UT No. 7 in the country, and he also is glad they think t=
he
Longhorns can contend for the national championship.
"We've sold 50,000 season tickets because of the fans' enthusiasm and
support," he said Sunday. "The fans are talking about winning a national
championship, too, and we haven't finished in the top 10 in 17 years, but
that's a good thing, too. We have high expectations and we want the fans to
have high expectations for us."
Brown said the team has a chance to be good if it can eliminate some of the
mental mistakes that  cropped up last year and continue to improve.
Texas ranked near the bottom nationally last season in net punting, averagi=
ng
slightly under 30 net yards per kick.
He said the goal this year is to average 38 yards net punting, and he said
Stockton is punting so well in practice that "the pro scouts are showing so=
me
interest."
"Overall, our punting is so much better than it was last year," he said.
Brown also said he thinks starting tailback Hodges Mitchell is even quicker
than he was last year and will be able to get the Horns some yardage as the
primary punt returner, and he said backup tailbacks Ivan Williams and Victo=
r
Ike will be the primary kickoff returners.
"We think we will be better in all those areas," he said.
True freshman CB Nathan Vasher ran a punt back 79 yards for a touchdown in
Saturday's scrimmage, and Brown said he probably will use him as a punt
returner at some point in the season.
Here's a look at how the team is developing, on a position-by-position basi=
s:
OFFENSE
Quarterback
Major Applewhite, the Big 12 Co-Offensive Player of the Year last season
after throwing for a school record 3,357 yards and another school record 21
touchdowns, seems to be fully recovered from off-season knee surgery, but h=
e
is locked in a battle with super talented sophomore Chris Simms for the
starting job.
Brown says he thinks both will play in the NFL and he says it's a great
problem to have. "I've had teams with no quarterbacks," he said. "I like th=
is
a lot better."
Brown also says everyone has an opinion about who will start, "but I'm the
one who will make the decision because I'm the one who will get fired if it
doesn't work out."
He also said both will play a lot this season.
Beau Trahan, a high school quarterback who switched to safety at UT, has be=
en
moved back to quarterback, and he threw a touchdown pass in Saturday's
scrimmage. He is very mobile and has a good arm.
Chance Mock, the heralded recruit from The Woodlands, is a great prospect.
He's built like a linebacker at 6-2, 215, but he runs like a wide receiver
and has a powerful, accurate arm. Brown  wants to redshirt him, and he want=
s
to redshirt.
Running Back
All Big 12 tailback Hodges Mitchell is back after rushing for 1,343 yards a=
nd
catching 32 passes for 343 more yards.
Converted linebacker Matt Trissel is the fullback, and he is a good one. He=
's
an outstanding blocker, good receiver and tough power runner.
Sophomore Victor Ike, the fastest of the tailbacks, has been looking good i=
n
practice, and currently is running ahead of Kenny Hayter and Ivan Williams
for the backup tailback job.
Converted tight end Chad Stevens and Brett Robin are the backup fullbacks.
Freshmen TB Sneezy Beltran and freshman FB Will Matthews are looking good i=
n
practice, but could be redshirted because of the depth at their positions.
Tight End
The coaches spent much of the spring building a passing attack around
multi-talented sophomore Bo Scaife, a 235-pounder with great speed. He was
slowed last season after undergoing knee surgery following his senior seaso=
n
in high school, but was sensational during spring drills.
On the very first day of fall practice, he hurt the other knee in a
non-contact drill and has already undergone surgery to fix it.
He is out for the season, but Brown said the injury was not as severe as th=
e
one to the other knee and said he should be ready to go by spring practice.
Since he played as a true freshman, this will be his redshirt year.
Junior Mike Jones is an outstanding blocker and good receiver, and he came
back 15 pounds lighter and a little quicker. He will do a fine job, but he
won't scare people with his speed.
Freshman Brock Edwards is a big, fast prospect and the coaches are working
hard to get him ready to play. He isn't as fast as Scaife, but he is very
fast for a 6-5, 260-pounder.
Wide Receiver
Redshirt freshman Artie Ellis and fifth-year senior Brandon Healy are the
starters, but true freshmen Roy Williams and B. J. Johnson have been
outstanding in practice and will play a lot, even if they don't start.
Williams, 6-3, 205, and probably the fastest player on the team, has been
making sensational catches almost every day in practice, and Johnson, 6-1,
185, and super fast, too, caught a 75-yard scoring pass from Applewhite
against the first-team defense in Saturday's scrimmage.
Two other true freshmen, Sloan Thomas and Tony Jeffery, are 6-2 speedsters
who also are pushing for playing time.
There is little experience, but a lot of young talent at wide receiver. The
youngsters may struggle in the early games, but some of them will help a lo=
t
this season and all of them are fast enough to scare defenses.
Line
Four starters return, and super sophomore Derrick Dockery, the lone new
starter, might be the best of the bunch. The line did a good job early last
season, but caught much of the blame for the late-season collapse.
Center Matt Anderson is getting a strong challenge from sophomore Beau Bake=
r
at center, and Cory Quye is holding off Mike Williams at right tackle for
now. Dockery is a fixture at left guard, Leonard Davis is getting some
All-America mention at left tackle and Antwan Kirk-Hughes is in control at
right guard.
Brown has called Dockery "the best true freshman lineman I have ever coache=
d."
Sophomore Robbie Doane is a strong backup at tackle, and redshirt freshman
Tillman Holloway is a talented newcomer at guard.
The line will be better because of the extra year's experience. The key
question is the degree of improvement.
DEFENSE
End
Nine starters return from a fine defense, but both seniors in 1999 were the
two defensive ends.
Sophomore Cory Redding, the Big 12 Defensive Newcomer of the Year last year=
,
looks like a future All-American at right end. He is a great pass rusher an=
d
an improving run stopper.
Defensive coordinator Carl Reese plans to try to fill the left end spot by
using three or four players. Jermain Anderson, quick but undersized at 232
pounds, is the starter. He is a fine pass rusher, but is too small to play
full time. Sophomore Cole Pittman has moved over from tackle because of his
run-stopping ability. Maurice Gordon and Adam McConathy also will play. The=
y,
like Anderson, excel at rushing the passer.
Reese likes the size and quickness of true freshman Kalen Thornton, who is
about 6-3 and 265. He says he will try to work him in  early this season to
see what he can do.
Tackle
Seniors Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers are a formidable duo and probably ar=
e
the best pair of tackles in college football. Hampton was a first-team AP
All-American last year, and Rogers is bigger, quicker and at times even mor=
e
dominating.
True freshman Stevie Lee, who graduated from high school early so he could =
go
through spring practice at UT, and redshirt freshman Marcus Tubbs are
outstanding backups. Another redshirt freshman, Ryan Haywood, has a lot of
potential.
Linebacker
Reese has four outstanding linebackers who are concentrated at two position=
s,
which is why he plans to play nickel (five defensive backs, only two
linebackers) defenses at least half the time
Juniors De'Andre Lewis in the middle and Everick Rawls on the weak side
(opposite the tight end) are returning starters who just keep getting bette=
r.
Sophomore O. J. McClintock also has been looking great on the weak side, an=
d
redshirt freshman Reed Boyd is pushing Lewis in the middle.
So, there is great quality and depth at two of the three spots.
On the strong side, however, juniors Tyrone Jones and Marcus Wilkins have n=
ot
drawn a lot of praise from Reese.
He just says the Longhorns play five or six teams who pass most of the time
and he will pull his strong side backer and play an extra defensive back.
He likes to have his quickest players in the game and all of his cornerback=
s
are good tacklers
Look for five or six defensive backs to letter before either strongside
backer letters.
Secondary
All four starters return, but junior Quentin Jammer and sophomore Roderick
Babers appear to be beating out returning cornerback regulars Ahmad Brooks
and Ervis Hill.
Jammer, living up to his name, is great when it comes to jamming receivers
and keeping them from getting off the line. He is big and physical.
Babers is a speedster who played a lot as the nickel back last year. He has
great man-for-man coverage skills and always looks for the pick.
Regardless of who wins the starting jobs, all of the cornerbacks will play =
in
Reese's nickel and dime packages. He also plans to substitute them a lot
because they do so much running.
True freshman Nathan Vasher also is pushing for playing time.
At safety, senior Greg Brown and junior Lee Jackson are returning starters.
Backing them up are redshirt freshman Dakarai Pearson, who is looking very
good this fall, and true freshman Phillip Geiggar, who graduated early so h=
e
could go through spring practice at Texas. Geiggar also looks like a future
star.
Reese usually plays extra cornerbacks in his nickel and dime lineups, but h=
e
has been working Pearson as a nickel back in some situations.
Football Notes . .
Two freshmen =01) running back Tyrone Richardson and linebacker Aurmon Satc=
hell
=01) have left the team at least temporarily to resolve some academic probl=
ems.
Richardson won't be back until January at the earliest. Satchell said he
hopes to get his problems resolved by the NCAA Clearinghouse in time to
rejoin the team this week.
* * * *
Backup linebacker O. J. McClintock and freshman cornerback Nathan Vasher ha=
ve
intercepted  a lot of passes in practice.
* * * *
Coach Brown says junior guard Antwan Kirk-Hughes is the most improved
offensive lineman, but he also said, "We feel like all five (offensive line
starters) will be quality players."
* * * *
Josh Doiron, older both of freshman defensive end Adam Doiron, is walking o=
n
as a tight end. Josh Doiron attended Kansas State for a year on a football
scholarship, but quit the team and attended Oklahoma last year. He did not=
=20
play football at OU. After sitting out this year at UT, he will have two
years of eligibility remaining.
* * * *
Redshirt freshman Monti Collier has been switched from cornerback to safety=
.
* * * *
Coach Brown says the true freshmen will have their first chance to move up
late this week. "We like to get through two-a-days before we do a lot of
moving up and down with the freshmen," he said. "We have to be sure they ca=
n
play at a high level on a consistent basis."
* * * *
True freshman WR Roy Williams makes at least one or two sensational catches
in every practice, and fellow true freshman WR B. J. Johnson also is making=
 a
strong bid for early playing time.

Texas Gets Top RB Cedric Benson as Lucky 13th Recruit

Cedric Benson, 5-11, 200, 4.5, of Midland Lee, the all-time Class 5A champ =
in
yardage gained and touchdowns scored, is a future Longhorn.
Thirteen is supposed to be an unlucky number, but not in this case because
Benson is the Longhorns' 13th early commitment, and he is a rare jewel.
He ran for an incredible 3,526 yards and scored an equally incredible 51
touchdowns last season to lead Lee to a 15-0 State Championship season.
Benson scored 44 TDs rushing and caught 14 passes for 360 yards and the oth=
er
seven scores.
He ran roughshod over a very good Aldine Eisenhower team in the state final=
s,
rushing for 192 yards and four touchdowns and bolting 78 yards with a scree=
n
pass for another TD in a 42-21 victory.
That was just another typical day for Benson, who had 238 yards and five TD=
s
in the state finals as a sophomore en route to a 2,000-yard season and 37
touchdowns.
Why did he pick the Longhorns over all the other top schools who offered
scholarships?
"I've always liked the University of Texas," he said. "I like the way they
use their running backs and have a balanced offense. The UT offense is a lo=
t
like the one we run here at Lee."
Benson said he was pulling for Ricky Williams to win the Heisman Trophy in
1998, and said Texas has been his top choice since he started drawing
recruiting attention.
Asked how many scholarship offers he has received, Benson said he quit
counting after 20. He also said the only other team he seriously considered
was Miami, "but I like Texas better and it's a lot closer to home."
Legendary high school coach Gordon Wood, who won multiple state titles at
Stamford and Brownwood before retiring several years ago,  says Benson "is
the best running back I ever saw in high school."
Wood's teams had some great backs and they played against some other great
backs, so he has seen more than his share of the great ones.
Benson is a back who sets up blockers extremely well and seems to sense whe=
re
a hole will be before it opens. He is an instinctive runner who is shifty a=
nd
hard to bring down.
He is on all the national top 100 lists as are fellow Texas pledges Jonatha=
n
Scott of Dallas Carter and Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village, both
offensive linemen.
OL Alfio Randall of Blinn JC, another Texas commitment, was a national top
100 prospect two years ago at Houston Yates.
Randall  had hoped  to enroll at Texas in January, but he needs 24 more hou=
rs
at Blinn, so he will have to remain at the junior college through the sprin=
g
semester to graduate. That will delay his enrollment at Texas until next fa=
ll.
Here's a list of the Horns' early commitments:
Offensive Line (7)
Jonathan Scott, 6-7, 290, 4.9, Dallas Carter, is a national top 100 player.
He is super quick for his size and has the long arms college coaches want f=
or
the key left tackle spot.
Abe Robinson, 6-6, 270, 4.9, Jersey Village,  is another national top 100
player. He plays tight end at Jersey Village and is the top blocker for sup=
er
junior RB Selvin Young, who ran for 2,204 yards last year as a sophomore.
Alfio Randall, 6-6, 300, 5.1, Blinn JC, was a national top 100 player two
years ago. He is super strong and extremely quick.
Mike Garcia, 6-5, 280, 5.2, Galena Park, broke the Aggies' hearts by changi=
ng
his early commitment to Texas. He is an offensive lineman with a defensive
linemen's aggressive temperament.
Will Allen, 6-5, 300, 5.2, Cypress Falls, is another highly recruited star
who has quick feet and great lateral movement
Roman Reeves, 6-6, 295, 5.2, another of the state's top eight offensive
linemen. He is a physically dominating blocker with good footwork and  a
strong upper body.
Terrance Young, 6-6, 340, 5.5, Longview, has a very quick start and, like
Garcia, is aggressive with his blocks.
Running Back (1)
Cedric Benson, 5-11, 200, 4.5, Midland Lee, the state's top running back an=
d
another national top 100 player.
Linebacker (1)
Yamil LeBron, 6-2, 240, 4.7, Killeen Ellison, was the middle backer the
Longhorns targeted early. He is very physical and tough, and he has great
quickness.
Defensive Back (4)
Cedric Griffin, 6-1, 180, 4.42, San Antonio Holmes, one of the state's top
two cornerbacks. He is the kind of tall, fast (10.5 100 meter time) corner
who loves man-for-man coverage and is very good at it.
Kendal Briles, 5-10, 175, 4.5, Wolfforth Frenship, a great option QB who wi=
ll
play safety at Texas. He was the Class 4A Offensive Player of the Year last
season while leading Stephenville to the Class 4A state title. He moved to
the suburbs of Lubbock because his father, Art, left his job as head coach =
at
Stephenville to become an assistant at Texas Tech.
Braden Johnson, 6-2, 200, 4.5, Euless Trinity, a fine athlete who will play
QB this season. He is a real head hunter
Brian Carter, 5-11, 180, 4.5, The Woodlands, a two-way star at WR and CB.
So far, only seven member of  Dave Campbell's Texas Football magazine's
24-man Super Team have committed to colleges, and the Longhorns have six of
them.
Benson is the only high school player ever to grace the cover of the state'=
s
top football magazine and he is joined on the Super Team by Briles, Griffin=
,
Scott, Young and Robinson.
The other Super Team  player who has committed is Madisonville running back
David Underwood, who says he will sign with Michigan.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: The Longhorns' search for a quarterback recruit has been
narrowed down to the best one in Texas and the best one in Louisiana. Matt
Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch is the top Texas QB recruit and Bret Rawls =
of
Shreveport Evangel is the top one in Louisiana. Rawls backed up superstar
Brock Berlin last year, but has soared to the top of the recruiting charts
after attending several major college summer camps. . . Eric Hall, the
outstanding defensive end prospect from Clarksville, Tenn., still plans to
take his official visit the Sept. 9 weekend. . . With 13 recruits already
committed and no defensive lineman among them, that is where at least five =
or
six of the remaining scholarships will be awarded. DT Tommie Harris of
Killeen Ellison is the key one because he is the top-rated DT in the nation
and because he is the only great one in the high school ranks in Texas this
year. Paul Broussard is a great one at Blinn JC, and he is very interested =
in
Texas, but he has a lot of work to do in the classroom. The Longhorns are
recruiting some big DEs who good grow into tackles, like Kaelen Jakes, 6-5,
260, 4.8, of Valencia, Cal. He lived in Plano during junior high.


Last Open Scrimmage Wednesday

The Longhorns will end two-a-days Monday and Tuesday with 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.
practices at Whitaker Field, then have their last open scrimmage Wednesday =
at
6 p.m. at Royal Memorial Stadium.
Coach Mack Brown said he plans to give the team Friday, Satuday and Sunday
off, then begin game week preparations next Monday.

Recruiting Roundup

The status of three outstanding players Texas is recruiting is rather murky
at this time.
LB Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar is committed to Texas, but is setting up
visits to Oklahoma (he was once committed to the Sooners) and several other
schools.
WR Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus committed to Florida and LB Michael
Williams of Lindale committed to Oklahoma last week, but then they both
decommitted.
Williams attended Texas A&M's game Saturday and plans to come to take an
official visit to Texas the December 14 weekend.
* * * *
The Longhorns' 16 commitments include nine players who are listed on one or
more national top 100 teams.
They are WR Marquis Johnson, 6-3, 200, 4.48, of Centennial High School in
Champaign, Illinois;  DE Chase Pittman, 6-5, 263, 4.7, of Shreveport Evangel;
LB Garnet Smith, 6-3, 221, 4.54, of Arlington Lamar, DTs Sonny Davis, 6-1,
320, 5.0, of Gulf Coast JC in Mississippi and formerly of Austin Lanier, Earl
Anderson, 6-4, 270, 4.8, of San Marcos, Lyle Sendlein, 6-4,  260, 4.8, of
Scottsdale Chaparral, the two-time defending Class 4A champion in Arizona;
OLs  Brett Valdez, 6-4, 310, 5.1, of  Brownwood and Neale Tweedie, 6-5, 260,
4.9, of Allen;  and TE David Thomas, 6-3, 210, 4.6, of Wolfforth Frenship.
Davis made all of the top national lists last year. However, he injured a
knee and has undergone surgery, and his coach at Gulf Coast JC says he has a
lot of academic ground to cover to graduate.
The other Longhorn pledges are DT Tully Janszen, 6-4, 255, 4.78, of Keller;
LBs Brian Robison, 6-3, 245, 4.6, of Splendora and Marcus Myers, 6-3, 220,
4.5, of Pflugerville Connally;   WR Dustin Miksch, 6-0, 165, 4.4, of Round
Rock Westwood;  QB Billy Don Malone, 6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7, of  Paris North
Lamar; DB Matt Melton, 5-11, 190, 4.43 of Tyler, and  RB/Ath Clint Haney,
5-11, 190, 4.27 of Smithson Valley.
* * * *
The Longhorns will give about 10 to 12 more scholarships and I think most of
them will be awarded to members of a 20-player group that includes QB Vincent
Young of Houston Madison, RBs Albert Hardy of Galena Park and Selvin Young of
Houston Jersey Village, WRs Timmons, Biren Ealy of Cypress Falls and Anthony
Wright of Klein Forest, TE Eric Winston of Midland Lee, OLs Justin Blalock of
Plano East and Tony Ugoh of Spring Westfield, DEs Bryan Pickryl of Jenks,
Okla., Larry Dibbles of Lancaster and Travis Leitko of The Woodlands, DTs
Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings, Marco Martin of Mesquite and Kasey
Studdard of Highlands Ranch, Colo., LBs Aaron Harris of North Mesquite and
Lindale's Williams, and DBs Edorian McCullough of North Garland, Brodney Pool
of Houston Westbury and Ricky Wilson of Port Arthur Lincoln.
If the Longhorns finish strong, they have a very good chance to get the four
top players on my 25-man "difference-maker" list.
They already have No. 4 in Earl Anderson and they have very good shots at No.
1 Wright, No. 2 Young and No. 3 Dibbles.
If Pikryl lived in Texas, he would be in my top 5, and he says Texas is the
leader right now. He took his official visit the weekend of the Colorado game.
The Longhorns might take a kicker if they find one who is consistent at
kicking off into the end zone. Trey DeCarlo at Carrollton Creekview is the
best I've seen this year at booting them deep. College kickers start five
yards farther back but DeCarlo's kicks usually carry out of the end zone.
* * * *
INTERESTING RECRUITING TIDBIT: The Longhorns lost their mystique for many
years, but there are a few signs they are getting it back. Consider this item
in last Friday's Chicago Tribune about UT pledge Marquis Johnson, a top 50
national  recruit from Champaign Cen-tennial,under a brief column entitled "8
Players to watch:
"Anytime Texas comes to Illinois to recruit a player, you know he's something
special."

Game Quotes . .

"We were able to spread the field today because (tight end) Bo Scaife made
some great catches and that opened things up. I think Bo gives us the ability
to stretch the field, even when the ball doesn't come to him, because the
defense has to be aware of where he is at all times. (Quarterback) Chris
(Simms) did a great job looking off on his big catch just before the half."
- Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis
* * * *
"This was a great team win for us. The offense did a great job of hanging on
the ball and running the clock, and the defense did a good job of getting
some three-and-outs. That's the way it's supposed to work when you draw it
up. I give a lot of credit to (CB) Quentin Jammer and (nickel back) Dakarai
Pearson for shutting down their big-play receivers. Jammer held (WR) Justin
Gage to two catches and Dak really did a good job on their tight end after we
decided to give him the primary coverage on him."
- UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese
* * * *
"I don't think I was running any harder in the fourth quarter. I think our
offensive line just wore them down a little. Coach Brown and coach Davis told
me I needed to take charge in the fourth quarter and I just tried to keep
running and pounding as hard as I could. It feels good to be part of the
record book."
- UT freshman RB Cedric Benson, talking about his game and the fact that he
is the first true freshman to rush for 100 yards in three straight games at
Texas
* * * *
"I was getting real clean releases. I used my speed to my advantage. I was
getting single coverage because they were worrying about our running game and
our wide receivers. They were just sitting back waiting for me to come to
them."
- Longhorn TE Bo Scaife, who caught five passes for 73 yards, including ones
for 27 and 28 yards that set up first-half touchdowns
* * * *
"We won and Oklahoma lost, Virginia Tech lost and Stanford is ahead of UCLA
(Stanford won). That's what I call a good day."
- UT quarterback Chris Simms
* * * *
"When I heard the Oklahoma score, I was a little happy. Then I heard the
Virginia Tech score and I was a little happier, then the UCLA-Stanford game
came as quite a surprise. That's three teams in the top five of the BCS."
- Longhorn wide receiver Roy Williams
* * * *
"He's a really good cornerback. He covered me as well as anybody I've seen
this year."
- Missouri wide receiver Justin Gage, talking about UT cornerback Quentin
Jammer, who held him to a season low two catches for 14 yards

Key Statistics

Missouri had 10 possessions and five of them were three-and-out series, while
another gained only four yards in four plays and ended with an interception.
The Tigers also started both halves with terrible offensive statistics,
making zero first downs in the first quarter and one first down in the third
quarter.

Scouting Baylor

Texas will play at Baylor at 11:30 a.m. Saturday in a game that will be
televised by Fox Syndication.
The Longhorns, ranked No. 5  in both polls, are 7-1, while the Bears are 2-5.
Texas is a 34-point favorite.
Baylor has lost five straight after opening the season with a 24-3 victory
over Arkansas State and a 16-13 win over New Mexico.
The Bears then lost to Iowa State, 41-0; Texas A&M 16-10; Nebraska, 48-7;
Oklahoma, 33-17, and Texas Tech, 63-19.
QB Greg Cicero, a former Longhorn, is the Bears' main offensive threat
As you can see from the teams' respective national rankings below, Baylor has
had trouble running the ball. There are 115 Division 1 teams playing football
and the Bears are 113th in rushing and also 113th in total offense and 112th
in scoring.
The Baylor defense has been tough at times, particulary in the 16-10 loss to
A&M.
But this is a game the Longhorns should win easily. Look for RB Cedric Benson
to extend his UT true freshman record of three straight 100-yard rushing
games to four and look for QB Chris Simms to have a great day.
It also should be a good day for the Longhorn defense to get back in the top
10 nationally.
Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):

Texas                    Baylor
Offense
(42)     169.1       Rushing Avg.        (113)    79.9
(43)     236.1       Passing Avg.         (86)   176.4
(42)     405.2      Total Off. Avg.     (113)  256.3
(7)        38        Scoring Avg         (112)    10.3
Defense
(12)       96        Rushing Avg.         (88)   194
(8)       163.1      Passing Avg.          85)   238.3
(4)       259.1     Total Def. Avg.       (94)   432.3
(6)        13.5  Opp. Scoring Avg          (92)   31

Longhorn Notes . .

Starting guard Antwan Kirk-Hughes sprained an ankle in practice last week and
was held out of the Missouri game. Coach Mack Brown said Derrick Dockery and
Tillman Holloway played well at guard. "We have three really good guards," he
said.
* * * *
QB Chris Simms climbed into fourth place on the Longhorn list for touchdown
passes. He has 28 after throwing four against Missouri. He passed Shea Morenz
and Bobby Layne, who had 24 each. Peter Gardere is in third place with 37.
Major Applewhite holds the school record with 58 career touchdown passes.
* * * *
WR Roy Williams had five receptions and a touchdown pass to move into 10th
and 5th places, respectively, in the UT career charts.

All Freshmen Report on Time; Colorado Impresses Nordgren

The 19 scholarship freshmen all reported on time Sunday, and coach Mack
Brown
made a slight change in the time for Monday's first freshman football
practice. The freshmen will practice at  11 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday and 9
a.m.
and 5 p.m. on Tuesday at Frank Denius Fields at 26th and Red River. I'll
publish official heights and weights on the freshmen when UT weighs and
measures them in the next few days.
The reason only 19 freshmen reported Monday was that DT Stevie Lee and DB
Phillip Geiggar both enrolled in January and went through spring training,
and DTs Sonny Davis and Marcel Moses failed to qualify academically and are
going to junior colleges.
Two walk-ons also showed up with the freshmen. To show up early, walk-ons
have to receive invitations because most walk-ons don't start practicing
until school starts. The walk-ons, both defensive backs, are Chad Davis,
5-10, 180, 4.5, of Dallas Skyline, and Justin McMinn, 6-0, 180, 4.5, of
Waco
Midway. McMinn was a first-team Class 4A All-State performer last season.
Brown said Nathan Vasher of Texarkana wants to play in the defensive
backfield and Tony Jeffery of Houston Klein Forest wants to play wide
receiver, and he said both will get their wishes.
Brown said Roy Williams of Odessa Permian, B. J. Johnson of South Grand
Prairie, Sloan Thomas of Klein and Jeffery will all be wide receivers and
he
said all four will be given hurry-up instructions to try to get them ready
to
play early because the Longhorns have no returning regulars at wide
receiver.
Vasher, an exceptional athlete who was a rare two-way first-time All-State
performer last year, could work his way into the Longhorns' dime package
(six
defensive backs) during the season because he has the speed (10.48 100
meters) to go along with good height at about 5-10 or 5-11, that the
coaches
like in their cornerbacks.
Brown said bump-and-run coverage is something the receivers and cornerbacks
will have to work on to earn playing time. "If a wide receiver can't
separate
from the defensive back, he's not going to play," Brown said.
He told me earlier this year that the thing that makes Florida State so
good
every year "is they can play bump  and run (on defense) and they can beat
bump and run (on offense)." He said the wide receivers the Longhorns
recruited this year can go a long ways toward beating bump-and-run
coverage.
* * * *
Several people have asked about the status of C Marcel Blanchard. He
received
a medical hardship scholarship because of chronic shoulder problem and is
no
longer playing football.
* * * *
The Rocky Mountains and the Colorado Buffaloes made a big impression on the
state's top QB prospect Friday and Saturday., Matt Nordgren, 6-5, 217,
4.62,
of Dallas Bishop Lynch, flew to Colorado Friday with his father and came
home
late Saturday.
He had told me he probably would commit to Texas right after he returned
from
Colorado, but now he says he wants to wait and take a few official visits
and
probably won't announce his choice until mid-October.
"Boulder is really a beautiful city," he said. "The coaches at Colorado are
really impressive. They have the program on the right track and they are
enlarging their stadium"
He said Colorado and Texas are at the top of his list, and said he also has
offers from Purdue, LSU, Oklahoma, Texas A&M, Tennessee, Iowa, Houston,
Missouri and several other schools.
This is not a good development for the Horns. When a recruit goes from
being
ready to commit to having a new big two after visiting a second school, it
is
not a good sign. I see it as about a 50-50 proposition now.
* * * *
The Longhorns are out front with two outstanding defensive ends from other
states, and they are in contention for still a third out-of-state defensive
end. The two who list the Horns No. 1 are Eric Hall, 6-3, 230, 4.5, from
Clarksville, Tennessee,  and Kaelen Jakes, 6-4, 255, 4.75, from Valencia,
California. Hall was born in Texas (Fort Hood) and Jakes lived in Plano for
about five years. Both are outstanding prospects who are drawing offers
from
other top schools. The one who is considering Texas is Shaun Cody, 6-5,
250,
4.7, of Los Altos HS in Hacienda Heights, California. He had an incredible
33
sacks last year. He says he plans to visit Texas.
* * * *
Texas has 12 early commitments  including seven offensive linemen. They are
Terrance Young of Longview,  Mike Garcia of Galena Park,  Jonathan Scott of
Dallas Carter, Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village, Roman Reeves of
Livingston, Will Allen of Houston Cypress Falls and Alfio Randall of Blinn
JC.
The other pledges are QB/DB Kendal Briles of Frenship, MLB Yamil Lebron of
Killeen Ellison, and DBs Cedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes, Braden
Johnson
of Euless Trinity and Brian Carter of The Woodlands.

Applewhite Still Doubtful; Simms Looks Like Sure Starter

Coach Mack Brown said Monday QB Major Applewhite's knee sprain is still
being
evaluated and he said Chris Simms would be the starting QB if the Horns had
a
game right now.
Texas doesn't have a game right now, but look for Simms to start Friday
afternoon against Texas A&M and look for him to get all the action unless
he
falters. If he falters, the coaches might try Applewhite, but he has never
been very mobile and he is even less mobile now.
If Applewhite is pressed into action, he probably will work almost
exclusively out of the shotgun because he can't backpedal very well.
Brown said he will have a better idea Tuesday about Applewhite's chances of

playing. He said the doctors were putting Applewhite through a lot of tests

Monday and he said he would have the results Tuesday.
Brown said he thinks Simms, who has had four passes picked off and returned

for touchdowns, has a better understanding of the UT offense now.
"I think he understands now hard hard it is to play quarterback at this
level," Brown said. "After the Kansas game, he said he knew he couldn't
complete every pass and he knew now you have to throw some balls away."
He said that is the key to playing quarterback.
Safety Lee Jackson and TE Brock Edwards, both battling leg injuries, remain

questionable for the Texas A&M game. I goofed in my fax last week when I
said
Greg Brown was hurt. I got my safeties mixed up.
* * * *
Offensive coordinator  Greg Davis  said the Longhorns need to be have a
balanced offense Friday. He said a good running game makes it harder for a
defense to handle a passing attack, and he said a good passing attack opens

up more running opportunities.
He said the Longhorns have won every game in which they have rushed for 200

or more yards at Texas.
* * * *
ODDS AND WEATHER: The Longhorns are 5 1/2-point favorites and the weather
Friday afternoon is expected to be nice, with highs near 65. There is a
possibility for thundershowers.
* * * *
FOOTBALL RECRUITING NOTES: An interesting game note is that three Longhorns

committed to Texas A&M before switching to Texas. They are QB Major
Applewhite, OT Leonard Davis and backup TB Victor Ike. . . TE Marquise Hill

of New Orleans De La Salle told me tonight (Monday) that he still hopes to
take his official visit this weekend, but he said "family problems" might
force him to reschedule. He has already visited LSU and he also plans to
visit Michigan, Georgia and Georgia Tech. . . I went to San Marcos Friday
to
see San Marcos junior DT Earl Anderson, 6-4, 270, 4.9, and he is a very
good
player. He will be one of the top DTs in the state next year. He is very
quick, very physical and his motor runs all the time. This year was a
skimpy
year for DTs, but next year should be a good one, with Marco Martin, 6-4,
290, 4.7,  of Mesquite, Rodrique Wright , 6-5, 310, 5.0, of Alief Hastings
and  Anderson. All three of them would be more highly recruited than any DT

in the state except Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison if they were seniors
this year.  The offensive line was the deepest group of top recruits this
year, and there is a good chance the deepest group next year will be the
defensive line. Other top junior defensive linemen include DEs Travis
Leitko,
6-5, 255, 4.7, of The Woodlands, Larry Dibbles, 6-3, 245, 4.7, of Lancaster

and Hosea Atkinson, 6-4, 230, 4.65, of Houston Washington, and DTs Patrick
Lee, 6-4, 275, 4.9 of Dallas Carter and Joseph Edwards, 6-3, 260, 4.9, of
Dayton. The Longhorns cleaned up on OLs this year and maybe they can do the

same thing on DLs next year. They will have very good shots at Leitko, who
had already been to a Texas summer camp; Wright, who says his top two teams

are Texas and A&M; and Lee and Edwards, who both have former teammates at
Texas.
* * * *
BASKETBALL NOTES: The Longhorn women defeated No. 15 Virginia, 56-55,
tonight
in the third place game in the Women's preseason NIT. They are 3-1 this
year,
losing only to No. 2 Purdue.

Part 2

Scouting Oklahoma

Texas and Oklahoma, both ranked in the top 15 for the first time since 1984=
,
meet at 11 a.m. Saturday in the Cotton Bowl in Dallas to battle for the
leadership in the Big 12's Southern Division.
The Sooners are 4-0 and ranked No. 10 in the Associated Press poll. The
Longhorns are 3-1 and are No. 11 in the AP voting.
OU has  six offensive and seven defensive starters back from last year's 7-=
5
team.
Oklahoma opened the season with a 55-14 rout of Texas-El Paso, then wallope=
d
Arkansas State, 45-7, hammered Rice, 42-14, and opened Big 12 play Saturday
with a 34-16 win over Kansas
Texas leads the all-time series 55-34-5 and has a three-year winning streak=
.
In fact, Texas dominated Oklahoma in the 1990s, going 7-2-1.
But coach Bob Stoops, in his second year as the Sooners' head man, has OU
humming along with an undefeated record and big ambitions.
Behind his all-out passing attack, the Sooners jumped out to a quick 17-0
lead over the Longhorns last season before UT defense coordinator Carl Rees=
e
changed his blitz packages and started getting enough pressure on QB Josh
Heupel to put the brakes on the OU offense and allow Texas to rally for a
38-28 win.
But it will be tougher this year because the Sooners of 1999 had no running
threat at all. They are rushing the ball much better this season, which kee=
ps
some of the pressure of Heupel.
The Longhorn defense should be able to pressure Heupel and corral the Soone=
r
backs if the Texas offense shows up early.
The Longhorn offense hasn't done much in the first quarter of any of its
games this year. One field goal and very little yardage is all UT has
garnered offensively this season.
But QB Major Applewhite, who killed the Sooners last year with his clutch
throws, seems to be regaining his magic touch after off-season knee surgery=
,
and sophomore RB Kenny Hayter had his coming-out party Saturday.
They keys to a Longhorn victory: (1) get a quick start on both sides of the
ball, (2) pressure Heupel and make him throw before he wants to, (3) a
reasonably balanced offensive attack, (4) no punt blocks, and (5) win the
turnover and time-of-possession battles.

Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):
Texas                              Oklahoma
Offense
(86)   100.2         Rushing Avg.        (53) 154.2

(32)   181.0         Passing Avg.          (51) 197.7
(132) 258.2     Total Def. Avg.        (30) 314.0
(10)   11.0     Opp. Scoring Avg           (15) 12.8

Big 12 Roundup

The big Texas-Oklahoma clash in Dallas is the headliner for the second week
of Big 12 play. It features the two pre-season favorites in the South and
also pits two nationally ranked teams.
Nebraska visits Iowa State in a battle of unbeatens in the North, but the
Huskers should romp.
The potential upset of the week features winless Colorado at Texas A&M. The
Buffaloes are winless, but they have played four very tough foes in a row.
They are a dangerous team, at their place or yours.

Recruiting Roundup

Brent Rawls, 6-5, 200, 4.7, of Shreveport Evangel, the top QB prospect in
Louisiana, took his official visit to Texas last weekend.
I saw him going into the Texas dressing room after the game and he looks to
be about as big as advertised. He also appeared to be having a really good
time.
His parents came to Austin with him, which always is a good sign on an
official visit.
Look for Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch or Rawls to commit to the
Longhorns within the next week to 10 days. Nordgren is the most likely futu=
re
Longhorn, but it could be Rawls.
Actually, it's a great situation for the Longhorns because Nordgren is the
top QB recruit in Texas and Rawls is the best one in Louisiana, so either o=
ne
would be a big catch.
* * * *
The Longhorns are still at 16 commitments. They will sign between 22 and 25
players, so there are six to nine spots left to fill.
I think most of those spots will be filled from a group of 14 players
consisting of Nordgren or Rawls; FB James Buchanan of Sarasota, Fla.; OLs
Jami Hightower of Jacksonville and William Winston of Houston Madison; DLs
Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison and Kaelen Jakes of Placentia, Cal.; DEs
Kevin Everett of Port Arthur Jefferson and Eric Hall of Clarksville, Tenn.;
LB Derrick Johnson of Waco; S Dewayne Brandon of Temple; Ath Joseph Addai o=
f
Houston Sharpstown and the Galena Park North Shore duo of TE James Moses an=
d
DE/LB Jonathon Jackson.
I think the Horns have at least 50-50 shots at Nordgren, Jakes, Everett,
Hall, Johnson, Brandon and Addai. I'll be surprised if they don't sign four
or five players from that group.
Buchanan, Hightower, Winston, Harris, Jackson and Moses are all strongly
considering Texas, but they also are looking at a lot of other schools.
Texas really needs to sign Harris because he is a great defensive line=20
prospect who really would be a great fit in defensive coordinator Carl
Reese's attacking style.
This is a year when great offensive line prospects are plentiful, but great
defensive linemen are scarce, and that is why Harris is such an important
part of the Longhorn recruitizing puzzle.
There is a chance some other big-time recruit will enter the picture, but
most of the remaining scholarships will go to players in one of the two
groups above.
* * * *
While big defensive line prospects are in short supply this year, I've
already seen three juniors who will be big-time recruits next year.
I've written about them before, but DTs Marco Martin, 6-4, 290, 4.8, of
Mesquite, and Rodrique Wright, 6-4, 290, 5.0, of Alief Hastings are the rea=
l
deal and so is DE Travis Leitko, 6-5, 255, 4.7, of The Woodlands. Leitko ca=
me
to the Texas camp this summer.
I have seen Wright and Leitko play twice each, and have seen Martin once an=
d
also watched a lot of tape of him playing running back and in the defensive
line. Any college would take all three in a heartbeat if they were seniors.
The program at Hastings lists Wright as weighing close to 350 pounds, but h=
e
looked more like a 270-to-290 pounder when I saw him play early this year
against Galena Park North Shore. He was a lot heavier last year, but he has
lost some weight and really is a great prospect.
While I haven't seen them play, I also have heard good things about some
other big defensive line juniors, including Damon Brown, 6-5, 265, 4.8, of
Houston Washington; Tully Jontzen, 6-4, 270, 4.8, of Keller, and Jarre
Rhodes, 6-6, 260, 4.8, of Dallas Lincoln, who also is a tight end.
While we're on the subject of juniors, there is a great linebacker at
Longview named Marvin Byrdsong. He is 6-3, weighs about 235 and runs in the
4.5 range.
Other super juniors include QBs Reggie McNeal, 6-3, 190, 4.4, of Lufkin and
Vincent Young, 6-5, 195, 4.5, of Houston Madison; RB Selvin Young, 5-11, 19=
5,
4.4, of Jersey Village; TE-OL Eric Winston, 6-6, 270, 5.0, Midland Lee, and
DB Broderick Thomas, 6-1, 180, 4.4, of Longview.

Sonny Davis Awaiting Test Score; Barnum Watch Ongoing

DT Sonny Davis is amazed by all the internet speculation that he is headed
for junior college, and he says it isn't necessarily so.
"I haven't got my test score back yet," he said Tuesday from California,
where he is training with the Texas All-Star team that will meet the
California All-Stars Saturday night. If he makes a qualifying score, Davis
said he will be in a Longhorn uniform this fall. If he doesnt, well, that's
why he signed a letter of intent with Mississippi Gulf Coast Community
College, a Mississippi junior college.
"That's my backup plan," Davis said. "I don't know yet what I am going to
do."
Davis has enough core courses to qualify and just needs a qualifying test
score.
* * * *
Greg Barnum, the Killeen Ellison center who was being touted as an
All-America prospect at Tennessee this season before quitting the team,
says
he probably will enroll at Texas or Stephen F. Austin in September to
continue his football career. Tennessee coach Phil Fulmer has refused to
release Barnum to Texas, but has said he will release him to Stephen F.
Austin.
Without a release, Barnum would have to pay his own way for a year if he
enrolls at Texas.
I'd like to see somebody challenge a coach's right to refuse to release a
kid. Scholarships are renewable now on a year-to-year basis, so Fulmer or
any
other coach can get rid of a player by simply refusing to renew his
scholarship. If a school can fire a player, then it's only fair that a
player
be able to fire the school. I know it's an NCAA rule, but there is a thing
called the U. S. Constitution that takes precedence over NCAA rules.
* * * *
Texas has two great DTs in All-America Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers, but
there is one at Blinn JC who might be just as good. He is Paul Broussard,
formerly of La Porte, which is Shaun Rogers' home town, too. Broussard was
a
great DT as a sophomore at La Porte when he weighed about 280, but he
ballooned up to well over 300 pounds as a junior and senior and was not as
dominating. He is about 6-4 and was back in the 290-pound range last year
as
a freshman at Blinn, and he was outstanding.
He's working in Austin this summer. If his academics are in order, let's
hope
Alfio Randall, the big OT at Blinn who plans to enroll at UT next January,
can talk Broussard into coming along with him.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: The Longhorns have apparently stepped up their recruiting
of running backs. In addition to offering Anthony Johnson of Jefferson last
week, the UT coaches are now actively recruiting Cedric Benson of Midland
Lee, who is on the cover of Dave Campbell's Texas Football magazine, and
Jabari Davis of Tucker, Ga.. . . Six Longhorn recruits were scheduled to
play
in the All-Star game in California Saturday night, but WR B. J. Johnson of
South Grand Prairie is nursing a sprained ankle and had to withdraw. In
addition to Sonny Davis, the other future Longhorns are WRs Roy Williams of
Odessa Permian and Sloan Thomas of Klein, DE Kalen Thornton of Dallas St.
Mark's and center Jason Glynn of Richardson Berkner. That game is supposed
to
kick off at about 9 p.m. Texas time and is supposed to be televised by Fox
in
most areas of Texas.
* * * *
FOOTBALL NOTES: Another internet rumor that has no substance, but has great
interest for Longhorns and Red Raiders is the one that has former Tech
coach
Spike Dykes going to work for Texas. Since Spike is still under contract
with
the Red Raiders, it would cost him well into six figures to go to work for
the Longhorns. It might happen down the road, but not anytime soon. I
normally don't comment on internet rumors, but I have had so many queries
about Sonny Davis and Spike Dykes that I just decided to give the facts to
all of you. . . Sophomore DE Adam McConathy, who weighed about 230 last
season, is up to 252 pounds and hasn't lost any of his speed. He is
battling
Jermain Anderson and Maurice Gordon for the starting job at right end. All
three are outstanding pass rushers, and the coaches want them to get a
little
bigger so they can do a better job against the run. . . If Sonny Davis does
wind up going to a junior college, freshman  Stevie Lee and redshirt
freshman
Marcus Tubbs will back up Hampton and Rogers at DT this year and they will
be
the guys to beat for the starting jobs in 2001. Barring an injury, I don't
think anyone will beat out Stevie Lee.

Brown Says Horns Have to Improve Running Game

The Longhorns worked out twice Monday, and coach Mack Brown praised the
players for giving a great effort, but he also voiced concern about the
lack
of a consistent running game.
"We've talked to the line about being more physical and we've talked to the
backs about running tougher, and we'll continue to work on that," he said.
The  lack of a consistent running game hurt the Horns at the end of last
season, and Brown and offensive coordinator Greg Davis said they want to
have
a more balanced offense this season.
While Hodges Mitchell is clearly the No. 1 tailback, speedster Victor Ike
seems to be laying claim to the No. 2 spot behind him. Ike has beefed up to
about 200 pounds without losing any of his great speed, and he he has been
doing a good job of blocking and hanging on to the ball, two areas that
have
posed problems for him in the past.
Brown, meanwhile, isn't giving any hints about who he will start at
quarterback on Sept. 9. He had seemed to be leaning toward sophomore Chris
Simms, in the wake of off-season knee surgery for All-Big 12 QB Major
Applewhite. But then he started saying Applewhite seems to be completely
recovered from the knee injury.
He could have started Simms and blamed it on Applewhite's suspect knee, but
now that he says the knee is no longer suspect, I frankly don't know what
to
think. My gut feeling is that it will be Applewhite, but I sure wouldn't
bet
any money on it.
Tuesday's 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. practices will wrap up two-a-day practices.
School starts Wednesday and the last public workout will be a  6 p.m.
scrimmage Wednesday at Royal Memorial Stadium.
Brown said the players will be given Friday, Saturday and Sunday off, then
will return Monday to start getting ready for the season opener Sept. 9
against Louisiana-Lafayette.
"We think it takes them two or three days to get their legs back, so we
always give them three days off just before the first game week of the
season," he said.
* * * *
Fifth-year senior WR Brandon Healy made several outstanding catches Monday,
and Brown said he is "the most consistent guy we have at wide receiver
right
now."
But true freshmen Roy Williams and B. J. Johnson continue to be impressive
every day. They catch the long balls, the short balls and the in-between
balls, and they have outstanding speed.
* * * *
Defensive coordinator Carl Reese said cornerbacks Quentin Jammer and
Roderick
Babers are playing well. He also said he is serious about playing more
people
this year. "We have a lot more depth on defense than we have had in our
other
two seasons here," he said.
* * * *
INJURY UPDATE: Brown said DE Cory Redding has a sore shoulder and knee and
LG
Derrick Dockery has an infected cyst. He said both players will be held out
of Wednesday's scrimmage, but  should be able to resume practicing next
week.
He also said CB Ervis Hill's sore knee will keep him out of practice until
next week. Backup DT Ryan Haywood has a sore shoulder, but might return to
workouts Tuesday, Brown said.
* * * *
RECRUITING  NOTES: Mike Crowe, head coach at Corpus Christi Flour Bluff,
has
a new junior middle linebacker who drew rave reviews in Pittsburgh, Pa.,
last
year as a sophomore before his family moved to Texas. The budding star is
Andy Matakis, 6-3, 220, and fast. He ran a  4.4 40 at a camp in Pittsburgh
in
May. Crowe said Matakis "is a big kid who can really run. We're going to
play
him at middle linebacker and we'll probably try him at running back, too."
A
story in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette last month said Penn State and Ohio
State had offered Matakis scholarships before he moved to Texas. . . The
Longhorns still have 13 commitments, and they have an outside chance to get
No. 14 when DE Eric Hall of Clarksville, Tenn., takes his official visit
the
Sept. 9 weekend.

 Horns Upset Long Beach in NCAA Baseball; Football Camps Start Soon

 No. 3 seed Texas (35-24) upset No. 2 seed Long Beach State (35-22), 11-2,
 Friday in the first round of the NCAA baseball regional at Stanford.
 The Longhorns will play in the winner's bracket finals of the
 double-elimination tournament at 5 p.m. Saturday, probably against
 top-seeded
 Stanford, which was playing No. 4 seed Marist in the second game Friday.
 Gerrit Simpson tossed his sixth complete game to lead the Longhorns to
 victory. He struck out 12 and allowed nine hits.
 Texas scored twice in the fourth and picked up five more runs in the fifth
 to
 take a 7-0 lead and coast to the win. Jeff Ontiveros had a two-run homer
 for
 Texas and Sam Anderson had three hits, three runs batted in and two runs
 scored.
 If the Horns win their 5 p.m. game Saturday, they will need only one more
 v
 ictory to win the sub-regional. But, if they lose, they will have to play
 again Saturday night in an elimination game to try to get another shot at
 the
 undefeated team Sunday. The team that emerges from the loser's bracket
 would
 have to beat the winner's bracket champion twice Sunday to advance.
 * * * *
 The Longhorns start their summer football camps a week from Saturday, and
 some of the top players in the state and in the nation plan to attend.
 DT Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale, Arizona, and FB-LB Brandon Hancock of
 Clovis
 West, Cal., head the out-of-state prospects who plan to come to the UT
 camps.
 Sendlein told me he probably will commit to Texas after the June 3 camp,
 and
 Hancock says he is very interested in Texas, but probably won't commit to
 anyone prior to the football season.
 Sendlein is the top prospect in Arizona and Hancock is one of the top
 recruits in California after dazzling everyone at a Nike camp in his home
 state. He checked in at 6-1, 242, then ran a 4.49 40, had a vertical leap
 of
 39 inches and bench pressed 185 pounds 43 times. Hancock said he will come
 to
 the UT camp that starts on June 10.
 Top Texas players who plan to come to one of the UT camps include QBs Paul

 Thompson of Leander and Jamie Beeghley of Midland Christian, WR-TE David
 Thomas of Wollforth Frenship, OLs Jeff Lebby of Andrews and Tony Ugoh of
 Spring Westfield, DEs Travis Leitko of The Woodlands and Nick Owino of
 Alief
 Elsik, DT Earl Anderson of San  Marcos, LBs Marvin Byrdsong of Longview,
 Garnett Smith of Arlington  Lamar and Andy Matakis of Corpus Christi Flour

 Bluff, CB Donald Burgs of Houston Madison and RB-Athlete Paul Mosley of
 Austin Anderson.
 The state's top RB, Albert Hardy of Galena Park, says he hasn't decided
 whether to attend a summer camp, but don't be too surprised if he shows up

 for one of the UT mini-camps.
 Texas still has just one commitment ? fine OL Bret Valdez of Brownwood ?
 but
 the Longhorns will pick up several more in June. That's when the Texas
 coaches always jump start their recruiting and pick up eight or 10
 pledges.
 * * * *
 An internet site calling itself  Collegefootballnews.com has picked Texas
 to
 go 11-0 during the regular season and beat Nebraska in the Big 12
 Championship Game.
 I liked that part of it, but then it picked Oklahoma to have the best
 defensive line and Texas to have the best linebackers in the Big 12. Texas

 will have a better defensive line than Oklahoma, and I know OU and several

 other Big 12 teams have better linebackers than Texas, so that doesn't do
 a
 lot for the site's credibility.
 The Texas coaches are proud of their defensive line and secondary, but
 they
 worry a lot about their linebackers.
 The site also rated UT No. 1 at quarterback, wide receiver, offensive line

 and defensive secondary  in the Big 12.

Cedric Benson Commits to UT; Brown Says QB Derby Too Close to Call

Record-breaking Midland Lee RB Cedric Benson, 5-11, 200, 4.5, committed to
the Longhorns Thursday night, Lee coach John Parchman said Friday.
Parchman
said Benson called UT assistant coach Mike Tolleson Thursday night and told
him he wanted to play for the Longhorns.
Benson was in El Paso for a scrimmage Friday night, but his mother
confirmed
the commitment. Tolleson, who coaches defensive tackles, is the Longhorn
assistant who recruits West Texas.
Benson is the 13th commitment for the Longhorns this recruiting season, and
he certainly is the most famous after rushing for 3,526 yards and 44
touchdowns last season. He scored seven other touchdowns on pass receptions
for a grand total of 51 TDs. No Class 5A back in Texas has ever accounted
for
as many yards or touchdowns as Benson did in leading Midland Lee to a state
title and an undefeated season in 1999.
Gordon Wood, possibly the greatest high school coach in Texas history after
leading Stamford and Brownwood to multiple state championships before
retiring several years ago, says Benson "is the best running back I have
ever
seen in high school." Wood's teams had some great backs and they played
against some other great backs, so that is high praise indeed.
Benson is on all the national top 100 lists as are fellow Texas pledges
Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter and Abe Robinson of Houston Jersey Village,
both offensive linemen. OL Alfio Randall of Blinn JC, another Texas
commitment, was a national top 100 prospect two years ago at Houston Yates.
Randall, by the way, had hoped  to enroll at Texas in January, but he needs
24 more hours at Blinn, so he will have to remain at the junior college
through the spring semester to graduate. That will delay his enrollment at
Texas until next fall.
The Longhorns' other early commitment are offensive linement Terrance Young
of Longview,  Mike Garcia of Galena Park, Roman Reeves of Livingston and
Will
Allen of Houston Cypress Falls; middle linebacker Yamil Lebron of Killeen
Ellison, wide receiver-defensive back Brian Carter of The Woodlands,
cornerback Cedric Griffin of San Antonio Holmes, safety Kendal Briles of
Frenship and defensive back-outside linebacker Braden Johnson of Euless
Trinity.
Briles, a great option quarterback in high school, led Stephenville to the
Class 4A state title last year by passing for  3,115 yards and 28
touchdowns
and running for 1,331 yards and 16 more TDs. So, between Benson and Briles,
the Longhorns have early commitments from two young men who accounted for
more than 8,000 yards and 95 touchdowns while leading their teams to the
state championships in the two largest classifications in Texas.
So far, only seven member of  Dave Campbell's Texas Football magazine's
24-man Super Team have committed to colleges, and the Longhorns have six of
them. Benson is the only high school player ever to grace the cover of the
state's top football magazine and he is joined on the Super Team by Briles,
Griffin, Scott, Young and Robinson. The other Super Team  player who has
committed is Madisonville running back David Underwood, who says he will
sign
with Michigan.
* * * *
Coach Mack Brown said Friday QB Major Applewhite appears to be completely
recovered after undergoing off-season knee surgery, and he said he and
Chris
Simms "are both outstanding quarterbacks," adding, "Honestly, I think both
of
them will play in the NFL."
But he said he isn't ready to name a starter for the season opener and
might
not name one until the game starts.
"They are really good," he said. "It looks like Major is going to be
healthy.
We really didn't know how healthy he was going to be, but his knee has held
up fine so far."
Asked when he plans to name one to be the starter against
Louisiana-Lafayette, he said, "I may not." Once, when he was coaching at
North Carolina, Brown didn't announce a starting quarterback until the
season
started and he sent his starting team out on the field for its first
possession. That could happen again this year.
* * * *
INJURY  NOTES: Freshman DT Stevie Lee returned to practice Friday and
looked
fine after suffering a slight leg injury Thursday.
* * * *
PRACTICE  NOTES: Brown has canceled Saturday's afternoon practice. The team
will scrimmage at 9 a.m. Saturday, then take the rest of the day off.

My next fax will be whenever events warrant.
