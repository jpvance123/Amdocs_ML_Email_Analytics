It looks like we are done on the new Citizens deal effective July 1.  I have sent original contracts for execution.  We now have to put the deal in the system.  This is a little complicated.  

The attached spreadsheet indicates how this deal will work, using June as an example.  The only differences between June and future months are:

1)  In the future, we will collect a $.09/MMBtu demand charge with $.02/MMBtu of this going to EAMR (ENA gets $.07/MMBtu)
2)  In the future, the PG&E discount is $.10, not $.25.

Some of the complicated booking issues are:

1.  We need to show the John Cogan commission as a separate deal and a cost to ENA
2.  We need to show the payment to EAMR as a separate deal and a cost to ENA
3.  We will continue to bill Citizens for the TW Mainline cost on our utility deal

1 and 2 above are pretty straight forward and should not create any deal entry difficulties other than someone will have to enter the deals.  Number 3 is more difficult.  The complexities relate to where we are making the sale and what costs should be included.  

Can you get with the folks who can help us here and have them come up with a recommendation on how this deal should be booked?  Let me know if you have questions.  I also believe I can add value in speaking with Darren Giron or others.  I guaranty their initial recommendation will not be 100% workable.

Thanks!

Chris

Ann & Darla,

I am attaching a spreadsheet that details what should be booked and billed to Citizens under the NEW gas daily call option/transport deal to serve the Griffith plant.  It is somewhat complicated but don't be scared - I will help both of you understand what needs to be done.  Hopefully, we can set up a procedure whereby this deal can be taken care of each month.

I think we should set up a meeting to discuss.  Let me know when you guys are available - hopefully sometime monday.

Thanks,

Kim

Over the last several years, we've received numerous questions and candid 
comments from many of you on a wide range of topics during our eSpeak 
sessions and through the Office of the Chairman online mailbox and 
voicemail.  While eSpeak is an open, informal chat between employees and 
management, the Office of the Chairman online mailbox and voicemail box are 
designed as confidential upward feedback tools for employees who choose 
anonymity.  We are pleased that many of you have openly expressed your 
thoughts and your identity, which made it possible for us to quickly respond 
to your questions and concerns.  This is the kind of work environment we all 
must strive for at Enron, and we encourage you to continue sending us 
comments about the things that are important to you.

Many times, however, we wanted to respond to those of you who contacted us 
anonymously with your good ideas, observations and questions.  We now have a 
way to do this while maintaining your confidentiality.  In the future, when 
we receive an anonymous question or comment from an employee, both the 
question and our response will be posted on eMeet.  This will allow us to 
answer all the questions that we receive, and it will give other employees an 
opportunity to provide their insight, if they choose to do so, since eMeet is 
an open discussion board.

Remember:  You can send your questions and comments to us in two ways:
 - email to Office of the Chairman, or
 - Office of the Chairman voicemail box at 713-853-7294, which is a 
confidential call

Promoting open and honest communication is consistent with our Vision and 
Values and absolutely vital to our continued success as a company.  So don't 
be hesitant or afraid to speak your mind.  We want to hear from you.

<< Us girls have talked about visiting you but just couldn't agree on a date.
 Joe and I just got back from a vacation in Banff, Canada with Jackie and
 Dannie.  We had a wonderful time.  We did some major hiking there.  It was
 so relaxing.  We had no t.v. or phone for a week.  We're going to Montana
 over Labor Day week-end for Joe's niece's wedding.  Can't believe Joe and I
 are taking 2 vacatins this year.  Regarding logistically getting to your
 ranch, is it possible to fly into Colorado Springs or do we need to fly
 into Denver?  We would love to come visit you if we can agree on a date
 because I love to hike.

  >>
You could come into Colorado Springs,but it would add 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours
to your commute.  There used to be a price advantage, but I don't think there
is anymore, unless you've checked recently.  The cabin is about 2 hours
northwest of DIA.  It's great hiking!  Let's find a time!!!!  How are Jackie
and Dan??

Jane, Southwest Gas shorted ENA  $16,386.19 for liquidated damages they claim 
occurred in November (see email below).  I have not received the support from 
SWG but have asked them to fax me a copy.  How would you like me to handle?

Enron incurred $16,386.19 in Liquidated Damages for the month of November.  I 
mailed a copy of them to your attention on 12/26.  Most of the fallouts were 
due to CPR and PRR which means Enron failed to perform their obligation to

Hello Cathy and Ed-

Just wanted to let you know my progress on cost estimates and documents.

The paperwork will be broken down into two documents for the initial phase.  
The first is a "Commitment" letter (an LOI of sorts) for just the free 
posting system we have been talking about.  It will be followed by a full 
blown "Electronic Transacations Agreement" that I am sure will take much 
longer for all our lawyers to get through.  I need to get the LOI's done to 
show our management here the level of commitment we have from our initial 
launch pipelines, and it should be to you within the week.  I am hoping this 
short document will not have a tough time getting through your legal 
processes.  The next document (ETA) will closely follow the LOI's, but I know 
will be more of a negotiation since that is where the real details are 
spelled out.

We are still in the process of finalizing the costs (Gap Analysis) and the 
deliverables for the GIR settlement system requirements.  I should have more 
information on this by the end of the week.

We unfortunately have had some slippage on the start date of phase one due to 
some scope changes, and personnel issues.  We are definately looking into 
first quarter of next year, so that buys us some time with getting the 
documents through our respective legal departments.  I apologize for this 
delay, but once we have the signed LOI's back in our shop, we will be able to 
lock down a launch date.

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

I will update you as news breaks......

Thanks,

Julie  :-)

18 INSIDE FERC-August 13, 2001
?2001 The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. Reproduction forbidden without permission.
BLAMING EACH OTHER, EL PASO SHIPPERS CALL FOR ALLOCATION OVERHAUL
Contract demand shippers last week argued anew that insufficient physical capacity exists on the El
Paso Natural Gas Co. system and that full-requirement shippers often are to blame for system disruptions
on peak days. In comments, various El Paso shippers called on FERC to address their concerns and many
suggested that the commission should pull together separate but related El Paso proceedings.

For its part, El Paso rebutted a July 17 complaint (RP01-486) by a group of mostly full-requirements
shippers located east of California. The EOC shippers alleged that El Paso was neglecting its responsibili-ties
to existing shippers while concentrating on drumming up new business without needed system
upgrades or expansions. The shipper group claimed that a 10-year rate freeze running through 2005 gives
El Paso no incentive to improve its system to maintain service quality (IF, 23 July, 3).

The complaint "is without foundation in fact, law or policy," El Paso insisted in an Aug. 6 answer. The
pipeline "has consistently maintained" facilities or built new capacity "whenever it has been economically
justifiable" under the 1995 settlement. In the meantime, a large and unexpected increase in full-require-ments
load has triggered use of a capacity-allocation scheme, which also was agreed to by parties in the
settlement, El Paso told FERC.

Frustration with the capacity-allocation methodology was expressed by CD shippers in response to the
complaint. In representative comments, the Indicated Shippers agreed with the EOC shippers that a
"chronic" shortage of capacity exists on El Paso but did not accept the EOC group's version of events that
led to the problem or its proposed solution. The EOC group asked FERC to direct El Paso to add facilities
and dedicate all of the 230,000 Mcf/day of capacity from an ongoing conversion project to existing firm
contractual obligations.

The Indicated Shippers derided the term "existing firm obligations" as vague enough to cover
new power plants and referred to the controversy surrounding El Paso's Redhawk project, which FERC
recently agreed can be built under automatic blanket authorization to serve two power plants in
Maricopa County, Ariz. To bring certainty to the El Paso system, all shipper rights must be better
defined, the Indicated Shippers demanded in calling for all full-requirements contracts to be converted
to contract demand contracts, echoing a similar assertion made in a July 13 complaint by a group of
CD shippers (RP01-484).

Otherwise, full-requirements shippers will enjoy unlimited use of capacity at the expense of other
customers, the Indicated Shippers continued. "The absurdity of the claim is demonstrated by analogy to a
request that an airplane be built to carry all customers who might request service on a particular day,
without requiring the customers to make a reservation," they said.

The "entire ability" of El Paso to handle increased volumes systemwide was questioned earlier this
summer by Commissioner Pat Wood III in a June 27 discussion prior to the Redhawk vote (IF, 2 July, 4). El
Paso was directed to relate in its order 637 proceeding (RP00-336) how well upstream capacity can handle
new load on the system. El Paso committed in a July 9 letter to serve full-requirements customers "while
satisfying" obligations to California customers.

On days of short supply, shippers using primary points are scheduled ahead of those using alternate
points and interruptible shippers, El Paso went on to say. If firm shippers using primary points exceed
available capacity, then volumes are allocated on a pro-rata basis. El Paso also reiterated its plans to use
the capacity from the conversion of the All American Pipeline L.P. to serve existing customers.

Beyond requesting the information in the order 637 proceeding, FERC should take another step to
consider "the totality of circumstances on the El Paso system" and reopen the pipeline's rates under section
5 of the Natural Gas Act, Southern California Edison Co. asserted. The increased load by full-requirements
shippers caused problems in flowing contracted quantities on El Paso, SoCal Ed contended.

Full-requirements and contract demand shippers pay for service differently, SoCal Ed continued. While
CD shippers pay demand charges for all their volumes, full-requirements shippers pay charges based on
total billing determinants of 766,659 Dt/day. When FR customers use more than that, El Paso is unable to
honor firm commitments and the customers "enjoy a free ride at the expense of California consumers," the.utility complained.

Oneok Energy Marketing and Trading Co. L.P. registered a similar concern, contending that the pro-rata
allocation methodology favors FR customers. "Full-requirements shippers can game the system by
nominating volumes far in excess of their actual needs, and thus receive disproportionate volumes in the
pro-rata allocation scheme" that El Paso uses, Oneok said.

Given that the related complaints deal with the same issue, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Enron Corp.
and El Paso asked FERC to consolidate the cases. The cases should be addressed in one hearing where
"numerous allegations of contested fact" could be investigated, El Paso submitted.

But neither shipper group is right, the pipeline maintained. It insisted that it adheres to the letter of its
contracts, tariff and two settlements to meet obligations to customers. Because unanticipated growth in
full-requirements demand has caused use of the capacity allocation procedures, El Paso would like to
establish a new systemwide allocation methodology in the order 637 proceeding, it told FERC.

"In anticipation that this escalating usage under the FR contracts will come under commission
scrutiny, the [EOC] shippers apparently chose to make a pre-emptive strike," El Paso said. FERC
should consider whether there is a "reasonably proportionate limitation implied" in El Paso's FR
contracts, the pipeline continued. Full-requirements shippers cannot demand more and more volumes
without paying for it, El Paso held.

"It is ludicrous for the [EOC] shippers to suggest that it is economically justifiable for [El Paso] to
construct expensive mainline facilities, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, to serve ever-increasing FR
loads at [EL Paso's] commodity rates," El Paso argued.

Besides, the commission has no authority to force a pipeline to expand under the circumstances at
hand, El Paso continued. Under NGA section 7(a), FERC's ability to order a physical connection to a
pipeline is limited to service for local distribution, El Paso noted. Any decision about other pipeline
facilities must be left to stockholders and directors of the companies, it concluded.

As per our conversation about penalties to Southwest Gas, the Sitara deal # 
is 538767. It is a sale to Southwest Gas for 10,000 a day at 12.50. On 
Sunday, January 21st, they failed to nominate the gas for cycle 1, Since TW 
Needles was full after the first cycle, when the gas was nominated for cycle 
2, only 191 flowed. We need to send them a penalty invoice for the remaining 
volume of 9,809. Please send a copy to Janie and myself when this has been 
done. If you have any questions or if I can help in any way, please call me 
at ext. 30494. Thanks for your help.

Please see the attached order, which was issued by FERC on July 25, 2001.  The information specified in the order will need to be submitted monthly for the six-month period covering August 1, 2001 through January 31, 2002.  FERC plans to extend the reporting requirement through September 30, 2002 when it receives OMB approval.   The information will need to be submitted  Fortunately, FERC is recognizing the commercial sensitivity of purchase and sales transaction data and will treat it as "confidential" under FOIA exemption 4.  Transportation information obtained from pipelines and LDCs, on the other hand, was not deemed to be commercially sensitive.  However, respondents will be permitted to request privileged treatment pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 388.112 of FERC's regulations.

Please give us a call if you have any questions.

Janie:

Here is a summary of the new structure that we discussed for Harbor.  

1.  Each day we would call in our estimate of usage for the next day.  On 
friday we would  call in our estimate for Sat - Mon.

2.  The desk would bill us ON USAGE, not on deliveries or ordered.

3.  EPMI would pay the mid point of Gas Daily.

4.  EPMI would pay a demand charge of $.025/MMBtu based on a max DQ of 20,000 
MMBtu/d times the number

Let me know if this works for you.  If so, we will try to close the deal with 
the customer.  If you could call me back today that would be great.

Jane, I still have two discrepancies with Southwest Gas which I need your 
help in resolving.

1.  SWG says price on Sitara 518455 Day 7 should be $9.50 instead of $9.55 - 
You have already confirmed with me that the price should be $9.55.  I 
forwarded your email to my contact at SWG and she responded with the email 
below.  Could you please call SWG trader Mark Anderson so that this can be 
resolved?

2.  On Sitara 386140 SWG says trigger is calculated on physical, not 
scheduled, volume - You have already confirmed with me that the trigger is 
based on scheduled volume and that you feel SWG will not agree.  According to 
my contact at SWG, their trader Bill Brown confirmed with her that the 
trigger is based on physical volume.  Can you please call Bill so that this 
discrepancy can be resolved?

I appreciate your help in resolving these issues.  Although I have already 
forwarded your responses to Nancy at SWG, she is being very insistent that 
SWG is correct and is requesting that the traders resolve these issues.

Thanks again
Laurie

Please have her contact Mark Anderson our trader.  He assured me it was

With the extension of the PRC to all organizations, questions have arisen=
=20
about the results of this process. This memo provides some details about th=
e=20
PRC process.

First some context:  The key to Enron=01,s success is the increasing qualit=
y and=20
dedication of our talent.  As we continue to attract and retain the very be=
st=20
people, we all have continued to raise the performance bar throughout the=
=20
organization.  At the core of our system are the following principles:

? Hire the best people.
? Provide challenging opportunities.
? Pay well =01( and pay for performance (with bonuses based on merit, not=
=20
entitlement).
? Evaluate performance through a rigorous review process.
? Provide clear feedback and direction to employees.

The PRC is a critical component of our performance management system.  The=
=20
PRC is built on this foundation:

? 360 degree performance feedback.
? Review by a broad group, not just the supervisor.
? A relative ranking of performance across Enron to determine promotions an=
d=20
to allocate bonus money.


In addition to understanding this broad philosophy, we all need to understa=
nd=20
the following details:

? Relative ranking.  Enron uses the descriptors =01&superior=018, =01&excel=
lent=018,=20
=01&strong=018, "satisfactory", =01&needs improvement=018, and =01&issues=
=018 to group all=20
employees.  This year, =01&relative to his/her peers=018 precedes each of t=
hese=20
descriptors. This qualifier confirms what we have done and will continue to=
=20
do in practice; that is, evaluate individual performers against their peers=
. =20
It is possible, therefore, for someone to perform at the same or higher lev=
el=20
compared to prior periods, yet receive a lower rating for the current perio=
d=20
if other employees=01, performance raised the bar.
? Teamwork.  A relative ranking may invite the view that for one employee t=
o=20
gain, others must suffer.  However, feedback is explicitly solicited on=20
teamwork when evaluating each individual=01,s performance.  Anyone who atte=
mpts=20
to gain by withholding information or refusing to collaborate with others i=
n=20
the organization will suffer in a relative ranking on this key performance=
=20
criterion.
? Preferred distribution. In large part, the quality of our workforce has=
=20
been driven by our willingness to make tough decisions. We have consistentl=
y=20
captured business opportunities and overcome obstacles because we have made=
=20
the choices that had to be made in order to constantly improve our employee=
=20
talent base. The preferred distribution (5% superior, 30% excellent, 30%=20
strong, 20% satisfactory, and 15% needs improvement or issues) forces PRC=
=20
committee members to identify those who must improve in order to remain at=
=20
Enron as well as to single out top talent for special recognition. There is=
=20
some flexibility in the system, but every organization must ultimately face=
=20
this difficult question: have we achieved the highest level of performance =
or=20
are there still improvements that must be made? Few, if any, organizations=
=20
adhere exactly to the preferred distribution. Rather, they exercise informe=
d=20
discretion in the individual categories and meet a distribution that reflec=
ts=20
their groups=01, overall effectiveness and need for improvement.
? Communicating Ratings. Everyone rated =01&satisfactory=018 or below shoul=
d know=20
his/her rating. Each organization has determined for itself whether to=20
communicate ratings of =01&strong=018 and above.  In all cases, employees w=
ill=20
receive feedback about their performance against expectations, areas of=20
success, and areas that need improvement.

We hope this answers most of your questions about the PRC process.  We woul=
d=20
like your feedback and ideas on how to improve the PRC process going=20
forward.  Therefore, we will be conducting an eSpeak in the near future, an=
d=20
there will be other methods we will create to let us know what you think.  =
In=20
the meantime, please feel free to consult with your HR Generalist if you ha=
ve=20
any immediate questions, comments, or concerns.

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
Breaking News : posted Aug 15, 11:27 AM
PG&E Suspends Open Season for 1.2 Bcf/d of Pipe Capacity 
Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) has announced that it has suspended its open season for additional intrastate pipeline capacity that was scheduled to close Aug. 30. The California utility said it made the decision not to go forward with the open season at this time while conducting a corporate wide review related to its ongoing bankruptcy proceedings. 
PG&E emphasized that the open season was being deferred, not canceled, and that shippers would have a minimum of 30 days to prepare bids for service when it resumed. 
"I don't want to say that we were premature in beginning the open season," said PG&E spokeswoman Christy Dennis, who noted that the company simply "has pulled back for the moment" due to the "huge reorganization process" related to the company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Shippers shouldn't view this as a "huge red flag" on the project. 
Dennis could not cite a specific date when the open season would resume, but she said "it should be reinstituted within the next few months." Shippers will be notified then, she noted. 
The utility first announced the open season in late May, saying that it planned to offer more than 1.2 Bcf/d of backbone capacity on the Redwood, Baja and Silverado paths on which gas from Malin, OR; Topock, AZ, and California in-state gas production is delivered to PG&E's local transmission system and other pipelines. Included in the open season was an anticipated 200 MMcf/d expansion of the Redwood path from Malin. 
The open season initially was to have closed on July 31, but PG&E extended it until Aug. 30. The utility, which currently transports more than 3 Bcf/d of gas in central and northern California, projected that the additional in-state pipeline capacity would be in service by Jan. 1, 2003, but the open season suspension could very well push back the date.

As part of an effort to facilitate communication on the trading floor, we 
have set everyone up with Microsoft Messenger.  
For those of you not familiar with the program, Microsoft Messenger allows 
you to talk real time with anyone on your contact 
list.  The program also has voice capabilities if you have a microphone.  
Messenger should now be fully installed on your 
computer and is accessible from the Start Menu.

You will need to set up a Hotmail account in order to use this service.  
Please follow the link below to set up your account. 
Once you have created an ID, please email me back with your ID so that I can 
compile a contact list for everyone on the floor.  
Let me know if you need help getting set up.

could be intercepted by a third party.  Any sensitive pricing information 
that you do not want disclosed should not be transmitted over
the program.

Jane,

you need to submit a request via the eRequest system.  (itcentral.enron.com)

Search for west power under "applications" and select general access, 
just note that you're in west gas.

That should do it.

Dear Western Region:

	I would like to thank Phillip Allen for his leadership of the west desk for 2000 and 2001.  He will continue as Managing Director at Enron North America and trade a financial book for the natural gas trading group.  Phillip will be sitting near the western region and will continue to participate in our goal to analyze the western market fundamentals to maximize wholesale trading efforts.  I will be assuming all management responsibilities of the west trading group effective immediately.

	I would like to take the opportunity to discuss our new organization for the Western Region trading group.  I have organized a vertical based trading structure that clearly defines each employee's responsibilities going forward.   Our goal is to organize all of our efforts in the west such that we will offer Enron North America the most profitable wholesale trading model.

The most significant change to the western region organization will be Keith Holst's role as Director of West Fundamentals.  Keith will manage this unit from the west desk, while using the services of Enron's centralized fundamentals group, headed by Chris Gaskill.  Our western region Fundamentals group will be responsible for delivering the most complete and market sensitive data to the trading desk.  We will all share in Keith's efforts to make our fundamental analysis the standard for all trading units within the company.

West Origination, led by Barry Tycholiz, will play a larger role in our term trading efforts going forward.  They will be joining our desk for fundamental forecasting meetings and discussions.  Our goal is to capture a majority of the term risk management efforts of our customer base.  We must succeed in capturing a majority of our customers' business to increase our share of lower risk earnings.  This contribution, along with our wholesale trading, will help our desk beat earnings expectations consistently.     

The West trading organization is structured to maximize profitability by sub-region.  The emphasis for the trading group will be to increase profitability and market information from each trader's sub-region.   We will be evaluated on how we organize and build the business and profitability in our respective trading areas.  This structure, however, does not preclude west traders from trading positions throughout the Western region and the North American gas market.  The West trading organization will be successful by creating accountability for trading responsibilities.
  
Please review the attached outline for the new trading structure.  We will be meeting as a group to discuss the changes soon.  The implementation of this structure will rely on our back office to set up the new books for each trader.  

Sincerely,

Michael D. Grigsby
West Gas Trading

Subject:	IMPORTANT NOTICE - Change of G-IMB


The attached was posted on GasSelect.  Please make sure you read so that you become familiar with the new standby procurement penalty rules for the G-IMB tariff.
In a nut shell: 
         
1) Penalty is now calculated at 150% of highest daily border price index at the SoCal border. 
2) The charge should begin from the first day of the "flow month" and end five days prior to the start of each corresponding imbalance trading period.
3)  The charge will be posted at least one day in advance of each corresponding imbalance trading period. 
Since this became effective on June 1, SoCalGas will determine the highest daily border price during the period of June 1 through July 20 and post it no later than July 24.  Customers are assessed this penalty for any underdeliveries outside the 10% tolerance for trades that take place from July 25 -30 for June imbalances.
Please call me if you have questions regarding this new G-IMB calculation. 
Thanks.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 
1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 
2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.

We will be releasing new version of the Stack Manager and the EnronOnline=
=20
website tonight . The following are the changes

1. Changes to Stack Manager:

1.1 Changes to toolbar icons:
To facilitate further development of the system, it has been found necessar=
y=20
to change the toolbar icons at the top of the Stack  Manager. The attached=
=20
file shows the old icon and its new replacement. Next to each image below i=
s=20
the description of the function that is executed as well as the short cut k=
ey=20
that is mapped to the same function:



1.2 New Functionality - Auto Suspend
The Auto Suspend function allows traders to set an absolute price change fr=
om=20
a price level at which you would like the system to automatically suspend a=
=20
specific product. This function is useful if your products use automatic=20
price resets.

To activate this feature:
1. Select a product and click on Product Properties
2. Check the Enable box
3. Enter the Price Check and Suspend at +/- values
4. Click Update
Example: a trader Enables Auto Suspend and selects a $35.00 Price Check and=
 a=20
suspension level of +/- $5.00: The system will suspend the product when the=
=20
mid price is above  $40.00 or below $30.00

You will need to enter a new Price Check or disable the Auto Suspend functi=
on=20
to reactivate this Product if the Auto Suspend is triggered. =20
Please note the system checks for any products that need to be suspended on=
ce=20
a minute.


2. Changes to EnronOnline Website

2.2 Submission Box

Are you Ready2Go ?

Have you ever experienced problems accessing the network remotely when traveling on business or when trying to work from home on your Enron laptop?  Would you like someone to test and customize the dial-up access on your laptop before you head out of town on your next trip? 

We have identified a need and are now supplying a new service for Corp and EBS employees and it's called Ready2Go !

This new service has been established to test, modify, and update the dial-up software on your laptop.

How it works:

A calendar has been created on ITCentral at <http://itcentral.enron.com/Data/Services/Ready2Go>

Go to the site and schedule a time that is convenient for you. Then, bring your laptop to our testing site, (either at 3AC105 or EB2268D).  We will examine your system, update your software (if needed) and even customize it for the next location you will be traveling to.  We'll also provide a training session in accessing the network remotely with your laptop.

If you are interested in participating, simply access the web site and schedule an appointment.

Thank you for your time.
The Ready2Go Team

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165.

Dear Mr. Collins:

RE:	Docket No. RP00-336-000

Pursuant to the procedures agreed to at the August 28 technical conference in the referenced proceeding, Enron North America Corp. submits the following informal data requests:

1.	Please specify the receipt points that are associated with each of the twenty pools that El Paso proposes to use for allocation of receipt point rights in this proceeding.
2.	For each of the specified receipt points, please provide on a monthly basis the average daily volume of gas that was scheduled for receipt into El Paso's system for each month from January 1, 2001 through August 31, 2001.
3.	For each of the specified receipt points that is not an interstate pipeline interconnection, please indicate whether, to the best of El Paso's knowledge, gas from supply sources upstream of the receipt point can be transported on any other pipeline, i.e., whether or not they are split-connected.

Please provide the requested information electronically in Excel spreadsheet format to the undersigned, with a copy to Jane Tholt (jane.m.tholt@enron.com <mailto:jane.m.tholt@enron.com>).

Sincerely,

Hi, everyone. Sorry for the delay in responding to all the messages and
emails regarding the meetings sponsored by SRP. There were a few people who
were in Phoenix before the WTC disaster and we did meet on Wednesday to do
some brainstorming. This email is an attempt to share the discussions with
those of you who were not here.

The parties who met were SRP, APS, PD, SWG, SoCal and the ACC. Joel Greene,
Barbara Jost, Kelly Daly and Dave Huard were here as legal counsel and Greg
Lander was here as a consultant. There are no new proposals on the table. We
did discuss ways to get to a point where we might be able to talk settlement
and whether or not parties might be willing to turn back capacity. No
surprise that we keep coming back to "what do you use to allocate the
existing capacity". Greg is going to run some numbers for the EOC based on
different starting scenarios using the assumption that CD capacity will be
made available at some level. He will also be looking at the impact of
seasonalizing the EOC loads.

SRP will reschedule the meetings (or arrange a conference call) to discuss
settlement once we have Greg's analysis. I wouldn't expect anything before
the end of September unless it is a conference call.

Thanks to everyone for letting me know your status during the week. It was a
relief to know everyone was safe somewhere.

I have put together a summary of discrepancies with the Imbalance trades for Socal.  I have attached my file to show where the problems exist.  I'm not sure who needed to receive this information so I am sending it to both traders that have forwarded me the spreadsheet.  Bridget Williams from EES spoke with Jane on Wednesday 9/5 regarding the missing purchases for 4/01 and 5/01.  The sales side of these transactions have been pathed but as my spreadsheet shows we are indeed out of balance by their purchase volumes.   I will also need to get resolution on these issues as soon as possible.  If you have questions or problems please let me know.

Thanks,
Marlo James

The attached report summarizes the discussions at the subject technical conference held in D.C. on July 18 and 19.  Copies of documents referenced in the report are available on request.  Please let me know if you would like any of them.

More was accomplished at the conference than I expected.  Note that a follow-up conference is tentatively scheduled for August 28.  I think the full requirements customers have finally gotten the message that they will have to accept some defined level of service.  It was also clear that El Paso does not have sufficient capacity to serve everybody's full load all the time and they will have to, at the least, credit demand charges when they cannot serve their firm shippers, and may even be required to expand their system.

Thank you for choosing Time Warner Road Runner as your high speed online
provider.  Your request has been received and it is currently being processed.
A customer service professional will be in contact with you within 48 hours.
While you wait, here are answers to some of the most commonly asked questions.

Q. If I am already a Road Runner customer what will happen to my account?

A. Your account will be transitioned to the new Enron billing system.  This
process is transparent to the end user.  The difference will be seen in your
monthly bill.  Keep in mind that there may still be prorated amount due on the
previous billing method.  Also, an account that is currently delinquent cannot
be transferred until the previous balance is paid in full.

Q. I?m not currently a Road Runner customer.  What is the process?

A. Your address will be checked to verify Road Runner serviceability.  If
serviceable, a customer service professional will contact you to set up an
appointment for a new install.  There are typically two time slot options a
customer may choose, 8am ? 12 noon or 1pm ? 5pm.

Q. Are there any installation charges?

A. All Enron customers will be charged a fee of $39.95 for a standard install
(network interface card not included).  Keep in mind that if you are getting
your computer through the Click at Home project, a network interface card is
already included.  A standard install is one that only required the installer 
to
run the cable to an outside wall.  There are extra fees for a network 
interface
card and running the cable between an inside wall.

Attached are three documents (cover memo, draft settlement proposal,
settlement procedures timeline) comprising SRP's formal proposal to resolve
five pending dockets, RP99-507 (Indicated Shippers' Complaint), RP00-336
(Order No. 637 Allocation and Pooling Issues only), RP99-139 (ONEOK
Complaint), RP01-484 (Indicated Shippers/California Complaint), and RP01-486
(Texas, New Mexico and Arizona Shippers' Complaint). We appreciate the
suggestions received to date and believe that while an uncontested
settlement may be unlikely, a sufficient nucleus is forming around the
elements of this proposal that will lead to the filing of an Offer of
Settlement and ultimate FERC approval as in the public interest.  We
encourage your active participation in this process.

Note that while Advisory Staff present at the July 18 Technical Conference
is aware conceptually that SRP will be distributing a settlement proposal,
this proposal has not been distributed to the Advisory Staff.  This proposal
has been sent to Rick Miles, Director, Dispute Resolution Services, for
informational purposes only at this time.

We are pleased to present you with a 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Award.  As a participant in this grant you have the opportunity to share in the ownership of Enron and the potential profit from increases in the value of Enron's common stock.

The 2001 Special Stock Option Grant was made to let you know how valuable you are and to recognize your contributions in making Enron the great company it is today.   Although there are no guarantees as to Enron's future stock performance, we believe that an Enron stock option has tremendous future growth potential.  The value you ultimately receive from your options will depend on the price of Enron stock at the time you exercise your options.  

You can access your 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Agreement and the Stock Plan document governing the grant via your eHRonline account on the intranet website at http://ehronline.enron.com.  Unlike stock options granted in the past a copy of your grant agreement will not be mailed to your home address.  

Additionally, the following information regarding the 2001 Special Stock Option Grant can be found on the HR website http://hrweb.enron.com.

?	2001 Special Stock Option Grant Highlights
?	2001 Special Stock Option Grant Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
?	A "How to Exercise Options" document that contains contact information and PaineWebber forms applicable to your stock options

Please take time to review this material.  It is important to us and to you.  If you have any questions, please contact your Human Resources representative.

Dear Optionee:

According to our records, you exercised Enron stock options on either 
December 27th or 28th.  When your stock options were initially exercised and 
processed, the income was treated as year 2001 income. 

We wanted to let you know that the income associated with your exercise will 
be reported as income in the year 2000.  Therefore, your 2000 Form W-2 will 
include these amounts as income.

Based on this, you will receive a revised confirmation of exercise from 
PaineWebber.  If you reached the maximum limit for Social Security taxes for 
the year 2000, then the Social Security taxes that were withheld on your 
December 27th or 28th exercise will be refunded to you on your January 12, 
2001 Enron paycheck.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Monique Blacklock at 
(713) 345-7885.

Jane, I have a few issues with SWG per their email below.

1.  SWG says the price on Sitara 518455 (Day 7) should be $9.50 instead of 
$9.55.  If this is correct, could you please change the price in Sitara?
2.  On Sitara 386140, SWG says that the trigger amount should be calculated 
on the physical volume, not the scheduled volume.  Can you please let me know 
which is correct and adjust in Sitara if necessary?

Also, SWG will be shorting ENA $198,026.60 for liquidated damages on contract 
96003533.  Would you like me to fax the backup to Patti Sullivan as I did 
last month?

I have one last question for you on contract 96003533.  For November and 
December gas, SWG is paying on the last day of the month versus the 25th.  I 
checked the contract and it does confirm this information.  However, it is my 
understanding that SWG is a netout customer (they have been receivable only 
for quite some time).  I have checked with contracts and credit and cannot 
find a netting agreement.  Do you know if there is a netting agreement which 
might override the payment terms on this contract?  I have a $2MM dollar 
invoice with a 1/25 due date that they will not be paying until 1/31.

Thanks for your help
Laurie

1.  Detail was mailed to you on 1/15.  the amount on your invoice # 19861SA 
agrees in total except for line item 3 on page 1 of 3.  The price should be 
$9.50 instead of $9.55 per Mark Anderson of our purchasing dept.

2.  The credit you applied on your inv # 19838SA is incorrect per Bill 
Brown.  The price was triggered at $4.74 on scheduled volume received.  Nancy

Janie,

 I have been talking with EES and they have confirmed their volumes for their 
purchases from ENA (I believe that it is Zarin who comfirmed their volumes on 
their side).  I need you to confirm and verify our volumes and to change them 
(or contact who can change them) if needed.  I am trying to get EES to pay us 
for these transactions and they will not if they do not agree.  The amount 
that we are talking about is over $10 mil.  Could you please look at this so 
that I can get this resolved today?  The following shows what we are out:



Please let me know what you find out.  Thanks...

Janie/Mike:

As you know, EPMI has been buying gas from the West Gas Desk for Harbor Cogen.  We dispatch this plant and buy their electricity.  Over the winter the Gas Desk was selling them (us) gas at Gas Daily Mid-Point plus $.05/MMBtu, based on consumption.  Since they have not operated that much there is not much money at stake.  With higher summer usage and the greater volatility at the border, however, this price is no longer fair for the Gas Desk.  

So, a couple weeks ago, I proposed a price increase to Harbor that would have them paying Gas Daily Mid-Point plus $.15/MMBtu still based on consumption.  They have been calling around and have an alternative deal, I think with Amoco that would have them paying Gas Daily Mid Point plus $.10/MMBtu based on scheduled volumes, not consumption.  We have to decide this week if we want to keep selling them gas or let them go to Amoco.

I hate to give up business, but it seems like we should unless we get a fair price.

Attached is a summary of a new structure that I think would retain the deal.  It changes the volume from scheduled versus consumption, and has them paying index plus $.10/MMBtu.  Schedules would be due by 8:30 and the volumes could not change over weekends.  I would suggest that it is better to keep this deal if I can get them to agree to the attached structure.  Please look it over and see what you think.  I will call later today to discuss.

Chris

Europe - headed by Matthew Scrimshaw
Asia - headed by Anthony Duenner
Americas - headed by Rich DiMichele

Additionally, the North American EBS origination teams have been consolidat=
ed into one group, led by Stewart Seeligson.  North American trading and ri=
sk management will continue to report to Paul Racicot.  Paul will also over=
see the global portfolio from a risk management perspective.

Global Network Operations will continue to report to the EBS Office of the =
Chairman.

All EBS asset positions will continue to be reviewed and repositioned to mo=
st effectively meet the future needs of EBS and the Portland office will be=
 closed by October 1.


Global Strategic Sourcing
Effective July 1, a number of measures and recommendations have been implem=
ented to reduce expenditures associated with, among other things, travel an=
d entertainment, and professional services.  Global Strategic Sourcing ("GS=
S") will undertake this very important initiative and they would like to en=
list your support in the implementation of these new procedures.

This message will focus on Travel and entertainment.  Next week's message w=
ill focus on professional services.

Travel and Entertainment - Enron has a tremendous opportunity to save on tr=
avel and entertainment expenditures by making some relatively painless adju=
stments.

?=09Air Travel - Air transportation is the single largest component in the =
travel mix.  In recognition of this fact, a number of significant discounts=
 have been negotiated with all of the major carriers.  There are two separa=
te channels available to employees to access the Enron-negotiated fares.  T=
he first is Travel Agency in the Park ("TAP"), or the GSS-approved preferre=
d travel agency for your location, and the second is the new Enron-managed =
online travel booking service, ClickTrip, located at <http://clicktrip.enro=
n.com/enron>.

Over the coming weeks, GSS will be promoting training and usage of ClickTri=
p, as the primary method of booking domestic U.S. travel for a number of re=
asons.  First, excluding proprietary carriers like Southwest Airlines, Clic=
kTrip provides employees easy access to all travel and pricing options for =
their destination, including the Enron-negotiated fares.  Second, industry =
data shows that employees will generally make the most cost-effective trave=
l decision when presented with the relevant facts.  Conservatively speaking=
, we estimate that a 20% savings in airfare is attainable through the use o=
f this tool alone.  Third, it is relatively painless to use.  Fourth, Click=
Trip is accessible 24X7 from any internet-enabled personal computer and aft=
er-hours telephone support is available. If you have travel-related questio=
ns, please contact Tracy Ramsey at ext. 6-8311.
=20
One final air travel reminder worth promoting: For employees who fly in the=
 United States, use of non-refundable coach tickets generally runs 65 perce=
nt less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying=
 a $100 fee.

?=09Lodging and Car Rental - GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a n=
umber of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate your business=
 unit's individual hotel policy. Additionally, preferred car rental rates i=
ncluding insurance coverage with National (U.S. and Canada) and Alamo (U.S.=
) have been negotiated for your use.  More detailed information is availabl=
e regarding both programs through our travel site located at <http://travel=
.enron.com>.

Enron Industrial Markets - Forest Products
EIM began trading in the physical markets for Forest Products (newsprint, p=
ulp, recycled paper, and lumber) in August, 2000 and Steel in January, 2001=
.  Since then EIM has handled over 140,000 tons of recycled paper, 180,000 =
tons of newsprint, 150,000 tons of pulp, 160 million board feet of lumber, =
and 210,000 tons of steel.  Currently on a weekly basis, EIM is moving appr=
oximately 20,000 tons of forest products (newsprint, pulp and recycled pape=
r), 3 million board feet of lumber, and 10,000 tons of steel products throu=
ghout the world. =20

Due to much larger volumes of forward trading, EIM is expanding its physica=
l product delivery capabilities around the world to physically handle 5 mil=
lion tons per year.  The EIM Logistics Group coordinates the activities of =
customer service, supply and demand matching, scheduling of owned assets, a=
nd physical transport and warehousing.  These activities are primarily coor=
dinated through the Houston office, with additional resources in London and=
 Singapore.

Additionally, EIM owns paper mills in Quebec City and New Jersey which have=
 a combined production capacity of 750,000 tons of newsprint per month, and=
 a cold rolling steel mill in Arkansas with capacity of 400,000 tons per ye=
ar.  Each of these facilities includes Logistics resources that are coordin=
ated through the EIM Logistics Group.

Enron Global Markets - LNG
Enron Global LNG has enhanced its Atlantic Basin LNG supply portfolio with =
volumes from Nigeria LNG Limited (NLNG).  Enron Global LNG recently signed =
a Memorandum of Understanding with NLNG for delivery of 1 BCM/ year (billio=
n cubic meters) or (97,000 Mcf/day) from the NLNG Plus Project.  This is a =
two train expansion of NLNG's existing Bonny Island LNG production facility=
.  The expansion is scheduled for completion in 2005.  This deal represents=
 a major step in the establishment of Enron's global LNG network.

EGM - Finance & Structuring
On June 29, 2001, Enron Global Markets - LNG Group successfully completed t=
he divestiture of its 100% equity interest in Progasco, to CHDR, Inc. via a=
n all cash transaction.  Progasco sells and distributes LPG to commercial a=
nd industrial clients, and independent resellers, through a fleet of tanker=
 trucks, bobtail trucks and 13 filling plants throughout Puerto Rico.  CHDR=
, Inc. is the record and beneficial owner of all of the issued and outstand=
ing shares of stock of Tropigas de Puerto Rico, Inc. ("Tropigas").  Upon co=
mpletion of this transaction, Tropigas, hitherto the 3rd largest market pla=
yer will operate the newly consolidated entity and control a 35% market sha=
re, becoming the 2nd largest Puerto Rican LPG marketer.=20

The sale proceeds of approximately $14.3 million, have been split between P=
rotane (a wholly owned Enron Corp. Delaware subsidiary) and San Juan Gas (S=
JG), and were used to pay down inter-company debt owed to SJG and Pro Carib=
e.  The net (pre-tax) gain recorded on the transaction was $3.9 million.=20

The profitable sale of this strategic asset allows EGM to exit the retail p=
ropane business it inherited through the 1985 merger of three companies: Pr=
otane, Petrolane and Imperial Gas, and will enable Enron to better deploy t=
he cash received and more efficiently manage its Puerto Rican human resourc=
es.=20

EGM - Weather
The Weather group just completed a deal with People's Energy to protect the=
m against lower gas prices during a warmer than normal winter.  This innova=
tive winter protection was structured to manage People's exposure to both t=
he volume and price of natural gas.  Greg Penman and Bob Beyer, from the Ch=
icago office, were the lead dealmakers for this transaction.  Simlar deals =
with other counterparties are expected to come over the winter season.
Also, the Weather Group has started exploring new opportunities with EES.  =
To support this effort, Elsa Piekieniak has joined the group.  Elsa is look=
ing for several people to help her with this initiative.  If you're interes=
ted in a position, please contact Elsa.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

UPDATE ON ENRON EUROPE'S CONTRIBUTION TO 2ND QUARTER RESULTS
Congratulations to all staff for your contribution to another fantastic qua=
rter! =20

By now we hope you will have had an opportunity to read about Enron's Q2 ea=
rnings, which were released to the investment community in Houston on Thurs=
day, 12th July.  Overall the business has seen continued strong growth with=
 revenues increasing to over $100 million in the first half of the year up =
from $30 million for the same period last year.  Earnings per share this qu=
arter also exceeded analyst expectations and came in at $0.45 for the quart=
er up from $0.34 for the same period last year.

Equally important, however, is the vital role Enron Europe played this quar=
ter in contributing to the company's overall results.   We are seeing some =
terrific trends here in Europe - notably, on the wholesale side, the Contin=
ental, UK and Nordic power and gas teams keep going from strength to streng=
th as we see exceptional growth in volumes and transactions continue this q=
uarter.  Total physical and financial settled volumes for gas and power in =
Europe have seen an increase of 172% in the first six months of the year co=
mpared to the first six months in 2000 and the total number of transactions=
 per day has risen to 604 from 272 last year.  Specifically, UK power volum=
es are up 204% to 147 TWh in the first six months of 2001 from 48 TWh in th=
e same period last year.  Continental gas volumes have grown from 351 Bbtue=
/day in 2000 to 1,390 Bbtue/day in 2001 - a 296% increase - and Continental=
 power volumes have seen growth of 360% with volumes rising from 18 TWh in =
the first six months of 2000 to 83 TWh for the same period this year.  The =
growth in volumes is not simply limited to the UK and Continental markets, =
however, as Nordic power volumes have increased by 153% from 29 TWh to 73 T=
Wh in the first half of 2001.

The success stories are not just limited to gas and power trading, however,=
 and abound throughout the business:

Enron Energy Services
The retail business has experienced a real boost this quarter with the clos=
ing of EES' first, major "marquis" brand energy outsourcing transaction wit=
h supermarket giant, J. Sainsbury plc.  Of equal importance, Enron Direct's=
 business continues to grow with total customers now in excess of 160,000. =
 The success of Enron Direct's business model has translated into the devel=
opment of new business on the Continent in the Netherlands and Spain and, m=
ore recently in North America, with the 2nd quarter opening of Enron Direct=
 Canada. =20

Enron Credit
A year after Enron Credit's launch, the total life to date notional value o=
f transactions has surpassed $11.8 billion and in the 2nd quarter alone, En=
ron Credit generated $10.4 million in EBIT.  Further, more than 20,000 read=
ers per week view the Enron Cost of Credit (ECC) through independent public=
ations.  =20

Enron Australia
With 2nd quarter power volumes up 177% from the first three months this yea=
r, Enron Australia is gearing up for a strong growth year.  With the develo=
pment of a physical power position key to expanding Enron's power trading i=
n Australia, work began this quarter to identify and begin the initial purs=
uit of asset development projects.  Other businesses undergoing significant=
 expansion this quarter were coal, renewable energy credits and weather der=
ivatives.=20

Spain:  Arcos
The Arcos asset development project in Spain continues to make great progre=
ss with third party access to gas supplies for the power project being succ=
essfully negotiated this quarter, plus the project achieved another milesto=
ne in the permit/government approvals arena with the granting of its water =
concession in Q2.

UK:  ETOL
ETOL, a long-standing contributor to Enron Europe's earnings, generated yet=
 another profitable transaction this quarter with the signing of a series o=
f deals with chemical giant Du Pont for supplies at Wilton International. T=
he transaction further strengthens Enron's relationship with Du Pont, one o=
f ETOL's largest customers, and will extend the current steam and power sup=
ply contract through 2010. =20

Enron Metals
A year after entering the metals business, Enron Metals has seen increased =
volumes of 130% in its merchant and financial trading operations this quart=
er with volumes up to over 3.5 million tonnes as compared to just over 1.5 =
million tonnes in the 2nd quarter last year.  Not only has the team seen po=
sitive growth in volumes this quarter, but they have increased their share =
of trading on the LME by 50% and are making significant progress with Proje=
ct Salem - a major IT and systems improvement project that will streamline =
deal capture and risk management for metals transactions.  Finally, the met=
als team achieved a true home run this quarter when they closed a major ten=
-year origination transaction that, through the addition of smelting assets=
, will enable the metals team to improve its trading position.  The transac=
tion proved to be the perfect opportunity to leverage all of Enron's tradin=
g and origination capabilities and involved input from a number of groups a=
cross Enron.  =20

Looking to the future, we have every expectation that the strong growth we'=
ve witnessed in Europe for the first half of the year will continue through=
 end 2001.  So, in the words of Solomon Smith Barney analyst, Ray Niles, wh=
en talking about Enron's European wholesale operations results this quarter=
, "Europe is kicking butt and it's about a quarter of [Enron's] activity, n=
early double what it was last year.  And, that is a new market that is the =
size of the US." =20

Just wanted to let everyone know about the changes that will be made in the 
upcoming week(s) to the EPNG/Blanco/Blanco meter.  Currently, Blanco is an 
active pool facility that is traded by the West desk.  In order to allow the 
Deal Confirmations group to identify which trades require special handling 
language in the confirm, we have all decided to create a second meter with 
the same data reference number in Global Facilities.  Doing this will serve 
three purposes.  First of all, creating a second meter on the same data 
reference number allows users to see two separate meters in Sitara without 
affecting the way that physical location is nominated to the pipe since all 
they receive is the data reference number.  The change will also allow the 
Product Controls Group to create multiple products in EOL with different 
pricing terms on the same physical point.  In addition, it will temporarily 
resolve the issue the Deal Confirmation is currently experiencing in 
segregating the confirmations that need special language.    I will be 
creating a portfolio that will include all new trades done at both BLANCO 
meters which will be monitored by the Deal Confirmation group.  I will make 
sure to contact all of you once the meter change has become effective.  When 
the change is completed, expect to see the following locations available for 
selection in Sitara.

Pipe Zone  Meter   Product Description
EPNG BLANCO BLANCO EP Blanco 100%; use the standard Delivery Location field 
and add flag "Special Handling - 2 Nomination Cycle       language". 

EPNG BLANCO AVGBLANCO RESTRICTED, use the standard Delivery Location field 
and add flag "Special Handling - Operational Constraints       language".

Please call me if you have any questions.

Jane, I just faxed the January penalty support.  Also, you mentioned that we 
should be billing penalties on the trigger deal - 386140 (EPNG - Blanco 
Supply Area).  However, this deal is linked to the same contract as the 
penalty for the nomination error.  I have checked the contract again, and all 
of the exhibits are expired.  In addition, I cannot find an exhibit which 
covers EPNG-Blanco Supply Area.  Given this information, would you still like 
me to bill the penalty, and if so, at what rate?

Thanks for your help
Laurie

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20

Thanks to all of you, Enron North America has had an outstanding year in=20
2000.  Some of the more notable accomplishments include:
a) 100% plus increase in EBIT from 1999 actuals to 2000 forecast;
b) significant rationalization of the balance sheet including the sale of t=
he=20
(i) Wind River/Powder River gathering assets, (ii) East Coast Power=20
generating assets, (iii) HPL and (iv) five of the six Eastern Peakers;
c) ENA is the leading energy merchant by a factor of two;
d) physical electricity volume grew by 34% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
e) natural gas volumes grew by 82% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
f) 500% growth in daily transactions from November 1999 to November 2000 du=
e=20
to the highly successful Enron OnLine distribution channel; and
g) ENA reaching its 25% ROCE target.

These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth=
=20
and opportunity in Enron North America for 2001 are consistent with that=20
success.  In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a=
=20
number of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The=
=20
goals of such re-alignment include:
a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe=
e=20
is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set;
b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation=
=20
with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal=
=20
flow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to=
=20
our trading organization;
c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate=
=20
our resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase=
=20
our =01&mid-market=018 originated transactions in our portfolio;
d) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading a=
nd=20
origination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better=20
align those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus;
e) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent=
=20
with our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and
f) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that ar=
e=20
critical to meeting our goals next year.

With these objectives in mind, patterned after the successful business mode=
ls=20
in Calgary and Portland, effective immediately the following changes are=20
being implemented:
a) East Power =01) a single East Power Team incorporating trading, mid-mark=
et=20
and origination will be formed under the co-leadership of Kevin Presto and=
=20
Janet Dietrich who will report to the Enron Americas - Office of the Chairm=

provide information and generate strategic positions.  Overall, the team wi=

c) Canada and Mexico =01) there will be no changes to the Canadian or Mexic=

offices which are managed by Rob Milnthorp and Max Yzaguirre respectively. =
=20
Both Rob and Max will continue to report to the EA OOC.
d) U.S. Natural Gas =01) there are several changes anticipated in this busi=

consistent with the goals and objectives described above. The changes=20
primarily affect the East, Central, West and Texas gas regions. Each region=

responsible for covering the LDC=01,s, muni=01,s/co-ops, industrials, IOU=
=01,s, IPP=01,s=20
and the producers.  There will be an increasing focus on the upstream side =
of=20
the business including the producers, transporters and storage providers in=
=20
addition to market area opportunities. The team will utilize all of ENA=01,=
s=20
product capabilities including the gas commodity, assets and capital. Each =
of=20
these groups will report directly to the EA OOC;
East Gas =01) a single East Gas Team incorporating trading, mid-market and=
=20
origination will be formed under the co-leadership of Scott Neal and Frank=
=20
Vickers who will be returning from Portland to join this team. =20
West Gas  =01) in a similar manner, a West Gas Team will be formed co-manag=
ed by=20
Phillip Allen and Barry Tycholiz, who will be joining us in Houston from th=
e=20
Canadian team. The Denver office under Mark Whitt will be integrated under=
=20
this team.
Central Gas =01)  in a similar manner, a Central Gas Team will be formed=20
co-managed by Hunter Shively and Laura Luce. The Chicago office will be=20
integrated into this team.
Texas Gas =01) the Texas Gas Team will be managed by Tom Martin. This team =
will=20
continue to manage the gas trading business around HPL until the pending sa=
le=20
is concluded in Q2 2001.  After the sale of HPL, this team will build a Tex=
as=20
gas business without ownership of the HPL assets. =20
Financial =01) this group will continue to be managed by John Arnold with n=
o=20
significant changes.
Derivatives =01) this group, lead by Fred Lagrasta, will offer derivative a=
nd=20
financial mid-market products and services to the natural gas market=20
specifically targeting CFO=01,s and treasury departments.  Fred will contin=
ue to=20
maintain certain existing mid-market accounts with a number of producer and=
=20
industrial accounts where relationships are well formed. Otherwise,=20
mid-market coverage will gravitate to the regions. The New York office gas=
=20
marketing efforts will continue to be managed by Fred.
Upstream Products =01) this group, lead by Jean Mrha, will develop several=
=20
distinct product offerings for the upstream segment of the gas market.  Thi=
s=20
group will develop and market the product in conjunction with the regions.=
=20
This is consistent with our desire to have a broader product offering and=
=20
greater market penetration in the upstream segment.  These products include=
=20
producer outsourcing, similar to our successful Petro-Canada and Suncor=20
relationships in Canada, physical storage re-engineering, compressor=20
services, wellhead liquidity products and offshore asset and capital=20
products.  In addition, Jean will manage our Bridgeline joint venture with=
=20
Texaco. =20
Gas Structuring =01) this group will be lead by Ed McMichael, reporting to =
Frank=20
Vickers, will provide structuring and deal support to all the gas teams.
Gas Fundamentals =01) this group will be lead by Chris Gaskill, reporting t=
o=20
Hunter Shively, will provide fundamentals to all the gas teams.   =20

Julie Gomez will continue to support the gas floor through several identifi=
ed=20
projects including long-term supply/demand analysis and, natural gas=20
transportation capacity trading opportunities.
=20
There is an expectation of some customer overlap between the gas and power=
=20
groups; for example, the combination utilities and the IPP=01,s.  The teams=
 will=20
coordinate with regard to the combination utilities like Con. Edison or=20
PG&E.  With regard to the IPP=01,s, to the extent that the product offering=
=20
involves an underlying power position, the power teams will manage. We have=
=20
asked Janet Dietrich to coordinate such overlaps between the two=20
organizations in Houston.=20

e) Technical/Restructuring - In the effort to consolidate and centralize ou=
r=20
technical resources (engineering, development, operations, pipeline) to=20
ensure that this skill base is available to all ENA groups and utilized=20
productively across the organization, Brian Redmond will form and manage th=
e=20
Technical Services Group.  This group will manage ENA=01,s technical risks =
and=20
will provide, on a cost basis, technical services for the entire ENA=20
organization. This group will manage the interface with EE&CC and OEC.  In=
=20
addition, the Restructuring Group, currently managed by Dick Lydecker, will=
=20
report to Brian Redmond.  This group is currently monetizing a large portio=
n=20
of the merchant investment portfolio given our current strategies.  This=20
group will have continuing responsibility to manage troubled commodity and=
=20
capital transactions that need considerable time and attention to manage ri=
sk=20
and monetize.=20

In addition to these responsibilities, Brian will manage the pending sale a=
nd=20
transition of the HPL asset over the next couple quarters as regulatory and=
=20
securities approvals are obtained in order to complete the sale.  Brian wil=
l=20
report to the EA OOC.

f) Principal Investing  =01)  with the departure of Jeff Donahue to new=20
opportunities in EBS, ENA=01,s venture capital function will be managed by=
=20
Michael L. Miller.  This group makes small investments in distributed=20
generation, power quality and technology companies that can benefit from=20
Enron=01,s distribution channels and expertise.  Michael will report to the=
 EA=20
OOC.

g) Corporate Development =01) Tim Detmering will assume the corporate=20
development responsibilities for ENA as Jeff transitions to his new role an=
d=20
will report to the EA OOC.

h) Generation Investments =01) there will be no changes to this group manag=
ed by=20
Dave Duran. Dave will continue to report to the EA OOC.

i) Energy Capital Resources =01) there will be no changes to this group=20
currently lead by C. John Thompson and Scott Josey.  John and Scott will=20
continue to report to the EA OOC.

As a final note in the interest of keeping things simple, Enron Americas wi=
ll=20
have two operating divisions  - Enron North America and Enron South America=
. =20
As a result, we will continue to conduct business under these two operating=
=20
companies; therefore, eliminating the need to change legal entities et al. =
=20
If you are currently a commercial employee of ENA or ESA you will continue =
to=20
conduct business in that company.=20

We look forward to another exciting year in the North American energy=20
market.  This is certainly a company unrivaled in the marketplace with the=
=20
most talented employees.  The opportunities are endless.  We wish you and=
=20
your family a very happy and safe holiday season.

I'll check on reviving the unbundling, but I think they've begged off of that for now.  In their most recent BCAP, they do propose to implement a customer-only open season on their backbone.  You have that proposal?  And having SoCal buy for SDG&E seems somewhat likely.  I can check on that.
 
Best,
Jeff

I was talking to one of my customers yesterday, and they said that Southern California Gas Co. recently made a filing to revive unbundling of their system.  Can you tell me if that is true .  Also can you tell me what the status is regarding Socal Gas purchasing natural gas for the  needs of SDGE's customers.  My customers tell me that is probably going to happen as well.

Subject: PG&E's Gas Accord II application 
Importance: High 


Today, October 9, 2001, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) filed an 
application with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). 

In this application, PG&E proposes a market structure and rules for the 
northern California natural gas industry, beginning 
January 1, 2003.  PG&E's filing was in response to a recent Commission order 
(Decision 01-09-016), which directed PG&E to file a "Gas Accord II" 
application. 

If you have any problems opening these documents, please contact me at (415) 
973-8677.

Please see the following instructions for the new messenging board.  If you 
have any trouble entering into this site, please let me know.  Everyone 
should now be setup and ready to go. You will have to add this site to one of 
your favorites.  

The Gas Message Board application can run on both IE5.0 and IE5.5 now. 

Attached is the URL for user to run the application.

http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com

Please feel free to forward above URL to people who like to test the 
application. 

Here is the steps they should do:

1) Launch Internet Explorer

2) Type: http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com (or just open this email and 
click on above URL)

3) Users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today. If 
they don't see any messages, there are two reasons: 
 (1) They are not valid users. Their names have not been added into the NT 
Web_GasTraders Group yet. Please contact Chrysti Hardy to add their names 
into the group.
 (2) There is no new messages added yet.

4) Click on "Comments" button to add messages: there will be a popup window 
when user clicks on "comments" button. There are two ways to send the 
messages after typing the 
messages into the text box:
 (1) just simply press enter to send the message. or
 (2) click on "send" button to send the message.

5) After the message has been sent, The message will be displayed on the main 
window immediately, the rest people who are online will get the new message 
in less than 30 seconds. This time can be reduced to as less as 1 second. 
However, I would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10 
second.  Because each time the browser refreshes the screen, the screen will 
be blink. Users don't want the screen blink every second while they read the 
messages.

6) All messages will be cleaned up daily at 6:00PM. If they like to clean 
them up later than 6:00PM, please let me know. I can reset the time.

Note: Right now the application is under test environment. If they like it, I 
will move it into production environment soon.

Let me know any feedbacks.

Thanks,

Fangming

Becky,

We are in the process of updating some of our pipeline fundamental information for the west.  As part of the process, I need to attach some probabilities to some of the proposed western expansions, and would appreciate your input on the following:

1) What are the timelines and major milestones in the FERC approval process (i.e. 18 months for environmental, land use, rate treatment, etc)?  
2) Which of these, in your opinion, are the most onerous?
3) I am trying to determine at what stage in the FERC process some of the expansions are in (see attached file).  Who should I talk to about this?  Melinda Pharms?

Thanks,

Phil Polsky

To contribute our personal best at ENRON, our conduct must promote respectful 
and co-operative work relationships. Workplace harassment conflicts with 
ENRON's vision and values and violates Company policy.  Harassment also can 
violate federal and state laws.  By understanding what harassment is and its 
potential harm, we can prevent it in our workplace.

We are pleased to announce that all employees of EWS and EES will receive 
harassment prevention training soon.  This training is mandatory for all 
ENRON employees.

During this training you will:

 Be able to recognize harassment
 Learn to take precautions against being harassed
 Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
 Know how to address a situation involving harassment
 Learn how harassment prevention is consistent with ENRON values

Please click here (  )  to sign up for the session of your choice.    If you 
have problems registering or have any questions, please call 713 853-0357.

The dates and times available for the sessions are:


 Tuesday, Feb 20; 1:00 - 2:30; 2:45 - 4:15; 4:30 - 6:00
 Friday, Feb 23; 1:00 - 2:30; 2:45 - 4:15

Janie,

I regret that when you called yesterday you didn't feel that anyone outside of me knew what was going with your portfolio.  Let me reassure you that there are several that are part of the team that immerse themselves in the accounts that we manage.  Unfortunately, insurance products are held at the insurance company.  We have submitted the proper paperwork to change the broker dealer.  That has been done.  Now we're waiting for First Union to network the annuities into your account so we can see them daily.  We at anytime can call Venture and get values and allocations.  We also have your profile on a spreadsheet where we track your Venture piece, 401k, Accounts with us etc...
Let me give you the result of the Annuities;

2106218    Current market -$6,718.00  Grip value 12,617.  Currently in Cash

2016219  Current market - 52,187.00  Grip value
100,880.85.  Currently in Cash.

2235338  Current market- 204,005  Grip value
222,923.  Currently in cash.

2235337  Current market- 137,391  Grip value
160,636.  Currently in cash.

2235339  Current Market- 40,101  Grip value
44,584.  Currently in cash.

2235336  Current Market- 15,586.  Grip value
17,700.  Currently in Aim All CAP.

The grip value is the guaranteed value through annuitization.  You have a guaranteed growth rate of 6% on an annual basis, with a step up election if the market value has performed greater than 6%.  The markets were great in 98 and 99 with the first annuities that we made an invest in.  We stepped up the market performance and that is why the grip value is at the levels listed.  We are in the final stages of the annuities being networked into your accounts.  One has already shown up on the account.  The other 5 should follow through shortly.  I'll track it daily and keep you posted.  The important thing for you to know is the the positions are in cash, except Josephs (I spoke to him last night, he sure sounds like a fun guy) annuity.  Hope that this helps.

Pat

Attention: Houston-based Outlook Users
The Global Messaging Team is proud to announce that beginning today, Monday July 16th, Houston-based Enron employees that have been migrated to Outlook will be able to securely access their Enron Email from anywhere on the web. This means that if you can get on to the Internet, you can access your Enron Email with Outlook Web Access (OWA) without having to dial in to Enron's network. Please note that this is not available to those users still on Lotus Notes but will be available once they are migrated to Outlook. 
Once on the Internet, type mail.enron.com in your browser address window and supply your Enron network logon credentials as username and password. For example:
Username: jdoe4
Password: ********
Once you log in, Outlook Web Access opens your Enron Email mailbox. Outlook Web Access (OWA) allows you to send and receive mail, perform calendar tasks and manage your mail and contacts, as well as access your mailbox folders. At this time, Public Folders are not accessible via OWA.  Please keep in mind that Outlook Web Access is a browser-based version of what you might use in the office, so the functionality may be slightly different and some features of Outlook 2000 may not be available at all. Additionally, OWA is only supported using Internet Explorer 5.x only and not supported with Netscape.
Outlook Web Access is the standard Email package for connecting to your Enron mail from home, whether you are using an Enron-issued home PC, an Internet connection with your personal home PC, or your ClickAtHome PC. We will not support the use of the full Outlook installation for home use.
Outlook Web Access for remote locations and European/APAC Enron sites is currently being addressed and will be available soon. At this time, OWA is only available if your mailbox resides on a Houston mail server.

If you have any questions, please call:

Resolution Center at x31411 or
	ETS Solutions Center at x54745

re currently moving the August physical trades into the new books and plan =

ooks through July 31st.  All August physical deals done during bid week sho=
uld flow into the new physical books and the old financial books.   Your fi=
nancial trades will move on the night of July 1st after we calc.  Starting =
August 1st, you will have your positions in your new financial and physical=
 books.  Russ is working on adding the new books to the West Intramonth Pos=
ition Portfolio in Sitara.  You should be able to see your physical positio=
ns for August in the new books as soon as we get all of the deals moved (to=
morrow evening at the latest).  The positions will be close in the morning,=
 we just need to verify that we have not missed any deals and move all of t=

Since we are doing the calling, we will call you.  We can give you plenty of 
notice.  Why don't we say by the close of business the day prior to NX3 is

Need to narrow down timing of their notification-sounds like they can call us

We have made the  following modifications to the EnronOnline applications.

Stack Manager Changes

Fill Order Enhancements - (Effective Tuesday September 25)
?	To fill a Top of Stack order in Stack Manager, Right click on the pink shaded order in the depth window of Stack Manager and select fill.
?	The trader now has the ability to fill limit orders that appear at the top of the trader's stack on both sides. 
?	The order will now be filled at the full order volume regardless of the trader's stack volume.
?	Filling an order will not move the trader's price or cause a hedge to occur.

Resize floated stack windows- (Effective Tuesday September 25)

You will now have the ability to resize the stack window to the desired extent.

Website Changes ( Effective Monday September 24)

Limit Order Restrictions on Physical Transactions -
?	Customers will not be allowed to transact with themselves on physical transactions. If a top of stack limit order has been placed on a physical product the counterparty or desk that placed the order will not be allowed to transact on it.
?	If a customer or desk has top of stack limit orders at different prices on both the bid and offer and subsequently moves the price of one so that they are at the same price, both orders will be cancelled. The customer would have effectively transacted with himself.

Please call me if you have any questions. Thanks.

	Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program.

	This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. 

	There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

	So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

	Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

	David Oxley

On the trigger, our system calculates as follows:

NX1 (Jan 2000)  $6.016
Trigger price               - $5.180
Trigger credit  $0.836

Trigger credit            $0.836
Scheduled volume       x465,000
Credit to invoice  $388,740.00

Southwest Gas is saying that the trigger credit should be on the physical 
flow, not the scheduled volume.  Can you please advise.

Thanks
Laurie

Dear Potential Gas Supplier

As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement
will come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current
commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to
use the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening
is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing
delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.

We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City
Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of
agreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by
the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our
Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep
us operating.

I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are
doing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed
contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,
if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new
year begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be
comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any
changes to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the
availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we
have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our
boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying
to do here.

I Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks

In the final analysis, we did not make a lot of progress in reaching 
agreement to settle the RP99-507 proceeding on El Paso's capacity allocation 
proposal at the conference in San Francisco last week.

The parties have agreed to proceed on a dual track because of Burlington's 
concerns about timing.  We will  reconvene for settlement discussions July 12 
and 13 at Southwest Gas's offices in Las Vegas after comments and reply 
comments are filed as permitted under the procedures agreed to at the May 2 
technical conference at FERC.  Comments are due June 30 and reply comments on 
July 7.  Amoco and Burlington filed the original complaint on September 21, 
1999, and requested fast-track processing under the Commission's new 
complaint procedures.  Burlington is pushing to have the Commission adhere to 
the fast-track processing of the complaint, maintaining that an order should 
have been issued within 240 days (I don't know where they got that from -- I 
can't find any such requirement), and vehemently opposed any attempts to 
extend the procedural schedule.

The tone of the meeting was set when Harvey Morris, representing the CPUC, 
was allowed to make a statement because he had to leave by 1:30 (the meeting 
started about 12:30).  He started by saying that the CPUC was in complete 
opposition to the Settlement Proposal circulated by El Paso on June 6, and 
then outlined all the reasons it was unfair to California shippers and was in 
violation of the '96 Settlement.  

After Harvey spoke, El Paso then reviewed its June 6 settlement proposal, 
which you received by e-mail, and provided some additional explanations of 
assumptions, etc.  Then the parties met in individual groups to caucus on 
their positions and reconvened as a group to discuss. 

Of particular note was the allocation of the 360 MM/d of San Juan-only 
capacity that El Paso proposed to take back from Burlington (97J4) and Amoco 
(97JB).  El Paso said that it had been allocated 106 MM to the Havasu 
shippers, 180 MM to the EOC shippers, and 74 MM to all others (California CD 
shippers).  This was a major point of contention in most of the ensuing 
discussions -- California shippers objected to EOC getting the lion's share 
of the additional San Juan capacity.  Under El Paso's proposal, EOC shippers 
would get 82% of their rights from San Juan and 18% from Permian, based on 
BDs.  CD shippers, on the other hand, get 61% and 39%, respectively.

EOC shippers pointed out that the BDs were not actually representative of 
their load.  BDs were simply a number negotiated among the EOC shippers to 
allocate the costs that were allocated between EOC and California in the '96 
settlement.  Certain EOC shippers suggested that their specified rights 
should be based on some other calculation, such as non-coincident peak day 
usage, rather than BD.

Another major issue was the proposal that full requirements shippers (FR 
shippers) be given systemwide receipt point rights in addition to the 
specified rights they would get based on their billing determinants (BD).  El 
Paso proposed that these systemwide rights would have a scheduling priority 
superior to that of a CD shipper using its capacity on an alternate firm 
basis (either alternate receipt/primary delivery or alternate 
receipt/alternate delivery).  Of course, the FR shippers approved of the 
proposal but most other parties  objected to it.  Several suggestions were 
advanced to try to reach a compromise (for instance, limiting FR shippers to 
primary specified receipt point rights during Cycle 1 nominations), but none 
were accepted.  Most non-FR shippers stated concerns about the practical 
impact of giving FR shippers such a scheduling priority, particularly since 
El Paso's interpretation was that the FR shippers would not have to nominate 
any of their Permian specified rights in order to come back to the San Juan 
with  the systemwide rights.

Everyone pretty much agreed that El Paso's proposal for capacity release of 
receipt point rights (#4 in their write-up) was a non-starter.  It was put on 
the table to address an earlier suggestion by EOC shippers that, if they 
could be made economically neutral to using non-San Juan points, they might 
be more receptive to some restrictions on their specified rights.  What they 
were looking for was some discount for using Permian and there was some 
further discussion along those lines but El Paso was not receptive, stating 
that such would mean opening the allocation of costs in the rate case.

A third issue was who gets what rights at SoCal/Topock.  SoCal Gas doesn't 
consider El Paso's proposal not to sell Block II turned-back capacity to its 
Topock point to be of much value since FERC has said they can't anyway.  
SoCal Gas is looking for a right to get out of any of its contract for which 
it cannot get a specified delivery point of SoCal/Topock.  However, SoCal Gas 
can't at this point commit to the group a number that it could live with as a 
specified right at Topock.  Conversely, all the other CD shippers who think 
they bought firm rights at SoCal/Topock are not willing to see SoCal Gas get 
all the rights unless they, too, can get out of their contracts.

Fuel was the other contentious issue that seems to be a key sticking point 
for certain parties -- some insist it has to remain in the settlement, others 
say there can't be a settlement if it stays in.  El Paso's proposal would 
move the fuel rate back to 4.85% effective 2/1/00 by changing the way they 
eliminate fuel used in facilities that have been refunctionalized as 
gathering.  In the filing to be effective 2/1/01, the rate would go down to 
approximately 4.4% and then to 3.88% on 1/1/03.  Burlington insists they will 
opt out of the settlement if they don't get relief on fuel.  Apparently, to 
the extent El Paso doesn't include the costs of compressors that Burlington's 
gas utilizes in systemwide fuel, they have to pay a higher fuel rate to El 
Paso's gathering affiliate.  They say it has already cost them several 
million dollars (I heard numbers between $9 and $27 million -- no hard data), 
and they will not settle without getting something in return.  

After the full group discussion and statements of position on Monday 
afternoon, Rick Miles, the FERC ADR facilitator, pushed for individual 
meetings between the various segments (EOC, California, producers, marketers, 
El Paso), based on several parties' representations that they were willing to 
continue talking.  A schedule was worked out and the individual meetings took 
up the morning on Tuesday.  Just before lunch, the entire group got back 
together and accepted Mr. Miles' suggestion that each segment select three or 
four representatives who would then engage in a full discussion of the 
issues.  He felt that with a smaller group it might be easier to reach some 
understandings.  However, it apparently didn't work because he called us all 
back late in the afternoon for a full group discussion, where the positions 
outlined above were stated and restated.  Certain parties, when pressed, 
could not agree to certain basic principles because, they said, they would 
have to get input from others in their organization.  Mr. Miles expressed his 
frustration that parties were at the table who didn't know what their bottom 
line position was (e.g., SoCal Gas, Southwest Gas).  Following discussion by 
the producers, particularly Burlington, as noted above that they would not 
agree to an extension of the date for filing comments, the next settlement 
meeting was scheduled after the filing dates.  Mr. Miles requested that 
parties send him an e-mail note that would state their bottom line settlement 
position, which he would keep confidential.  He would review all the 
positions and to the extent possible put then together and float a settlement 
package of his own.  He assured all that no one would be able to identify the 
individual positions from his package.

One positive note at this meeting was that there was no conflict over the 
pooling committee's report.  No one registered any complaints, although a few 
parties who had not been at the last settlement conference indicated that 
they would like to participate.

 This is how I see our bottom-line position.  I would like to send it to Rick 
late this week if everyone agrees.

A pooling procedure that will follow assigned priority rankings for both 
market and supply with no restrictions on pool-to-pool transfers (loops 
allowed).
Only San Juan receipt point rights on our Havasu contract, or, preferably, 
termination of the contract so that the San Juan rights could be allocated to 
others as part of a settlement.
Full requirements shippers systemwide rights above their specified point 
rights would not have a higher priority than CD shippers using alternate 
delivery points, although no objection to using some allocation method other 
than billing determinants, such as peak day volume, to establish those 
specified point rights. 

Do you have any opinion about the allocation of SoCal/Topock rights?  Please 
give me a call when you've had a chance to look this over.  I'm sure you'll 
have some questions!  Also, we'll need to talk about what kind of comments we 
want to file.

We will be releasing new EnronOnline functionality tonight which will be 
available for use on Monday morning. 

Two information sessions will be held in Houston to further explain the new 
functionality. It is very important to attend these sessions to fully 
understand the new features. For sessions in Calgary or Portland, please 
contact Savita Puthigai at 713 853 1787. For sessions in London, Oslo, 
Singapore, Australia or Tokyo, please contact PCG London on +44 20 7783 7783.


Date     Time   Location
Tuesday, 27th February  3.30 to 4.00  EB 27C2
Wednesday, 28th February 3.30 to 4.00  EB 27C2


There are two areas of new functionality: Spreads and Stack Manager.

Spreads

>From Monday, Enron traders will be able to define a Spread product on 
EnronOnline in which the customer can trade on a single spread product and 
receive a transaction for each leg of the underlying products.

For example, a customer could select to buy the April vs May Spread Product. 
A successful transaction would result in a Sell for the April Product and a 
Purchase for the May Product. Both of these underlying transactions will show 
up in the customer's transaction list (the spread itself will not show up - 
only the two legs). The price for Leg 1 will be equal to the average of the 
bid and offer, or the bid or offer alone if the averge cannot be computed 
because either side is  missing , for the Leg 1 Product. The price for Leg 2 
will be equal to the price for Leg1, plus the spread price.

To ensure accuracy and consistency, EnronOnline Product Control will set up 
these new Products initially.

Stack Manager

There are a few changes to Stack Manager which may or may not be directly 
associated with Spreads:

New Stack Link Type

On the Link Dropdown box on the Product Properties page, there is a new Stack 
Link Type called "Stack Basis Link". If you select this link, then the price 
you enter into the stack depth window will be added to the price in the stack 
depth window from the parent (it will not be added to the calculated price of 
the parent which appears on the website). For example:
 Product 1 is a Stand Alone Product, with Bid at $5.00
 Product 2 is a Basis Link Child, with Stack Depth Price at $0.25, so the 
calculated total price which appears on the website is $5.25
 Product 3 is a Stack Basis Link, with Stack Depth Price at $0.05, so the 
calculated total price which appears on the website is $0.30


Autohedge Changes

If an Enron trader has an autohedge set up between two products which they 
are managing under the same book, then the Parent product will respond as 
though an autohedge transaction has occurred, but no transaction will 
actually be entered into the system. This is intended to simplify position 
management where you want the parent price to respond to a transaction on the 
child, but do not want to manually remove transactions within the same book.

Note that autohedge functionality remains the same as it was before this 
update for autohedge transactions between products which are not in the same 
book.

Trade Linked View

You can now view linked transactions together on the transaction display 
section in the stack manager. To do so, right click in the transaction 
display section and select linked view. You will see a single transaction 
with a plus sign for any linked deals (e.g. spreads and autohedged deals). To 
see the individual transactions that make up the linked transaction click on 
the plus sign. 

You can display the linked transactions in a expanded or collapsed view. To 
do so right click in the transaction display area and select    Full Expand 
or Full Collapse.

To return to the default transaction display, right click in the transaction 
display area and select Transaction view.


New EnronOnline Contact

As part of a restructuring within EnronOnline, Savita Puthigai will be your 
primary contact within EnronOnline for Trading and System Design issues. 
Future emails such as this one will be sent from her address. She can be 
contacted in Houston on 31787.

Faye has completed creating the AVG BLANCO meter on the EPNG/BLANCO zone.  
The physical location server has been bounced and  in order to see it in 
Sitara, you will have to close all open Sitara applications (including the 
Launch Pad) and get back in.  If you have any questions, please call me at 
x35423.

Bob, the new portfolios that your group will need to monitor to track these 
new BLANCO and AVG BLANCO transactions are listed below.  You can open these 
portfolios in Deal Manager or Deal Ticker.

Deal Confirm - EPNG/AVGBLANCO

Subject: EPNG/BLANCO/BLANCO

Just wanted to let everyone know about the changes that will be made in the 
upcoming week(s) to the EPNG/Blanco/Blanco meter.  Currently, Blanco is an 
active pool facility that is traded by the West desk.  In order to allow the 
Deal Confirmations group to identify which trades require special handling 
language in the confirm, we have all decided to create a second meter with 
the same data reference number in Global Facilities.  Doing this will serve 
three purposes.  First of all, creating a second meter on the same data 
reference number allows users to see two separate meters in Sitara without 
affecting the way that physical location is nominated to the pipe since all 
they receive is the data reference number.  The change will also allow the 
Product Controls Group to create multiple products in EOL with different 
pricing terms on the same physical point.  In addition, it will temporarily 
resolve the issue the Deal Confirmation is currently experiencing in 
segregating the confirmations that need special language.    I will be 
creating a portfolio that will include all new trades done at both BLANCO 
meters which will be monitored by the Deal Confirmation group.  I will make 
sure to contact all of you once the meter change has become effective.  When 
the change is completed, expect to see the following locations available for 
selection in Sitara.

Pipe Zone  Meter   Product Description
EPNG BLANCO BLANCO EP Blanco 100%; use the standard Delivery Location field 
and add flag "Special Handling - 2 Nomination Cycle       language". 

EPNG BLANCO AVGBLANCO RESTRICTED, use the standard Delivery Location field 
and add flag "Special Handling - Operational Constraints       language".

Please call me if you have any questions.

We should change all settlements at Socal to NGI Southern Border, Socal from 
Southern California Border average.  This new index excludes KRS fixed priced 
trades.  Please let the brokers know about the changes to Socal basis going 
forward.  Please change basis and gd swing swaps (fp and index) in EOL.

Also,  Frank and Matt should set up basis and a gd swap (fp and index) for  
southern border, PG&E.  This will be the index for PG&E Topock.  This index 
will be effective for April 2001.  I will have the physical product out there 
as soon as possible.

Let me know when they have been changed.

Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.  No hand-outs were provided.

Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity
Topock  540 mmcf/d
Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d
Needles 800 mmcf/d
Wheeler 800 mmcf/d

New Receipt Points
Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d
Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d
Both will be available around Feb 1

Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation
Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.

New Calculation, Changes and Display
Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.

OFO Declaration
Name changes from overnomination
Can declare before any Cycle
Provide 2 hour notice
Post on Gas Select
Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select

Windows
Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's
Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.

Scheduling Changes-Nov 1
Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle
Copy confirmed noms
All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.

2 Hour Notice
Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  

Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO
Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules
Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:

Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut
Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut
Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut
Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.

For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:

         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes
Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2
Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1
Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4
Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4

In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.

Winter Balancing Rules
Effective Nov 1-March 31
No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements
50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)
70% of daily usage depending on storage level
70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min
90% of daily usage depending on storage level
90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.
Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.
Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.
Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,

Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.

Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.  
Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)
Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.

2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.

Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,
Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.

Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.


OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)

In our July 30, 2001 document entitled "Receipt Capacity Allocation Proposal
Prepared By Salt River Project" there is an inadvertent error.  Section I.F.
properly states that the numbers used in this proposal would be updated with
peak figures through the last season prior to additional capacity being
placed into service by El Paso.  Consistent with that, Section II.A., in
describing the CD and FR Entitlement Methodology, should read as follows:

II.A.	A total "peak day entitlement" is established for each FR customer
by summing its highest (peak) 	single day takes during the period January
1, 1997 through the end of the last season prior to 	additional capacity
being placed into service by El Paso, at each of its D-Code points (eg.
DAPSPHX, DSWGPHX, etc.).  (footnotes 1 and 2 unchanged)

Please make this change to your document.  We apologize for the error.  Joel
Greene

Subject:	Information on Physical Index Positions and the transport deals assigned to you

Attached please find the following three spreadsheets:

1.  A list of all Pipes and Zones with the trader's name and book by each.  We have assigned all July out physical deals (purchases and sales) according to this list.

The only thing that may be a little confusing right now is that Tori's name is by the SJ book.  Jane will manage the SJ book at first and then the switch will take place after Tori returns. 

 

2. A list of the transport Capacity Tickets and the traders assigned to each

 

3.  The most important List;  

This list represents the Physical Index position by point for July.  The one transport deal that was mixed into the system generated reports has been removed.  This list represents your Physical Index Positions as of Last night, May 19, 2001.

 

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.  I can update the positions list periodically, if you need it.

Thank you.

Anne

As you know, technology is critical to Enron; it drives our success and wil=
l=20
continue to do so in the future. Technology has helped Enron create new=20
businesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is=20
responsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com.  You=
=01,ve=20
seen what technology can do at work.  Now we want you and your family to=20
realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=
he=20
ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20
technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=
=20
click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=
=20
Internet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=
=20
the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=
=20
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=
=20
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20
ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=
=20
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20
employed at the time of implementation. =20
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=
ry=20
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of=
=20
your initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=
=20
http://clickathome.enron.com.  We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne=
ar=20
future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can=20
submit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com.=20

We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your=20
family.  We believe this program takes communication at Enron to a new leve=
l=20
by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in=
=20
the broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe=
=20
Enron is a great place to work.

The following additions and modifications to Stack Manager will be effective as of Saturday September 8, 2001.

Stack Manager Modifications

Inactivate All Stack - In addition to the individual Activate/Inactive Stack buttons, there is now an Inactivate All Stack button. Similar to the Suspend All button, this button will inactivate the trader's stack on all active products. Any existing top of stack limit orders will continue to post to the website and remain transactable. See screen shot below: Inactivate All Stack button on far right. 

	 

Please note that we have switched the positions of the suspend and inactivate buttons in Stack Manager.

Fill Order - If a product is set up as either Restricted Top of Stack or Top of Stack the trader now has the ability to automatically fill any order that is at the top of the stack. In order to fill a limit order that is at the top of the product's stack, which will appear in pink, the trader should right click anywhere on the stack window and choose "Fill order". The volume filled on an order will be that which is offered by the trader. In order to fill the complete volume of the order, the trader will need to adjust the volume in his stack.

Floated Stack windows - If the stack is inactive on a product, the price and volume fields on the my products tab will continue to be blank. On the depth window and floated stack window of these products the trader's prices will be in gray and italics. Children of products that have inactive stacks will not be gray and italicised in the floated stack windows and will not see the calculated prices.

No Auto Inactivate Stack - It is now possible to keep a product active even if the trader is not logged into Stack Manager. If the trader wishes to enable this functionality on the upper right corner of the product properties page the trader should choose "No Auto Inactivate when Stack Manager is down". 

Changes regarding Suspension of products

Stack Manager will inactivate products rather than suspend them in the following cases:

?	Market Close - If a product is active at the end of its trading hours its stack will automatically become inactive rather than suspending. In order to keep a product's stack active past the set trading hours, the trader should choose "Keep Awake" next to the trading hours section of the product properties page.
?	Auto Suspend now inactivates stack - On a product with the Auto Suspend function enabled to monitor the price changes on the product, the product's stack will be inactivated if the Suspend at level is reached. This feature can be used by checking the Enable box on the product properties page under the Auto Suspend section. 
?	Logging Out of Stack Manager- When you log out of Stack Manager without inactivating or suspending your products, the system will now inactivate your products rather than suspending them.

The Gas Research Institute has filed a proposal to revise the GRI surcharges from the level previously authorized in the 1998 Settlement.  GRI's filing has not been approved yet, but the Settlement provides for an adjustment under certain circumstances so there is a good chance it will be.  We will advise you of the outcome when FERC issues an order on GRI's proposal.  The new rates would still be below the current rates.  Both sets of rates are provided below for your convenience.



Rates (cents per Dth)	Current 2001	Settlement 2002	New Proposal 2002	
Commodity	0.7	0.5	0.55	
High Demand*	9.0	6.0	6.6	
Low Demand*	5.5	3.7	4.07	
Small Customer	1.1	0.8	0.88	
  				

*refers to high load factor or low load factor customers.

If FERC approves this proposal, the rates for 2003 will likely change from those in the Settlement as well.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165.

Per our conversation, here is the last draft out of that subcommittee.  As 
you remember, we were supposed to agree and then take our proposal back to 
the full group.  Unfortunately, that was about when the negotiations fell 
apart on the point allocations, so Rick Miles terminated the ADR process.

Hey Melba -- We would like to create a new product with the following product 
name:  EPNG SoCal Ehr.  This product name should be used under the product 
type US Gas Phy.  The description should contain the same language as the 
EPNG SoCal Topk product except the word "Ehrenberg" should be substituted 
every time the word "Topock" appears.
 
We would also like to create physical index products for this trading point, 
but we need to change the short description of the current NGI SoCal index 
product to allow for the addition of the specific point name, and we would 
also have to change the description of the original index product as well.
 
I left you a message to call me if you can today.  Thanks.

Looking through my e-mail messages, I did receive SoCal's comments on 
Thursday afternoon of last week.  On cursory review, little if anything has 
changed in the format.  SoCal has suggested splitting the one guarantee into 
two guarantees, one for trading and the other for the tariff program.  With 
respect to the guarantee for trading, SoCal has conceded on a few points.  
Alternatively, SoCal has communicated that it will not concede with respect 
to my comments on the guarantee for the tariff program.  Of course the lack 
of changes with respect to my comments is not conducive for finalizing the 
guarantees and, based upon numerous past examples, will result in protracted 
negotiations.  I must add to the last sentence of your e-mail below, SoCal is 
unwilling to transact with Enron until we agree to its terms in the 
guarantee.  Given the situation, and the desire to trade immediately with 
SoCal, you may want to consider temporary security until we can reach 
resolution on the guarantees.  The alternative is to suggest to SoCal that it 
has entered into several guarantees with Enron Corp. that in the past was 
acceptable to SoCal, the most recent in June 2000, and that we find it 
difficult to understand why SoCal is insistant on using the form that is 
proposes.

Please give me a status update on your review of the SoCal guaranty.  
Conversations with their credit group indicate SoCal has sent back their 
comments to the guaranty to you and are now waiting on your comments.  As I 
have mentioned in previous e-mails, SoCal is unwilling to transact with Enron 
until the guaranty situation has been resolved.  

Thank you,
Russell

Janie - Leslie sent me a copy of your message indicating that you need to know about items that would be considered at the FERC meetings.  Until we get the data base set up and populated, and get a link for y'all on the Fundamentals web site, you can access the Agenda for each meeting at this FERC web site one week before the date of the meeting:  <http://www.ferc.gov/public/isd/sunshine.htm> 

Meetings are generally held on the second and fourth Wednesday of every month, except for August.  Occasionally, a meeting will be scheduled on another day instead.  The dates for the 2001 meetings are at this web site:  <http://www.ferc.gov/calendar/commissionmeetings/cmeet2001.htm>

The consent agendas are listed first by type (Markets, Rates and Tariffs - Electric; Markets, Rates and Tariffs - Gas; Hydro Projects; Certificates; etc.).  Any discussion items are listed at the end.

Please find attached a cover letter and the body of the Request.

We did not reiterate the four studies in the request as we believe we have
agreement on them (to wit the current physical capacity of the system summer
and winter with a Winter NCP by customer as the allocater for the winter
period and the Summer NCP by customer as the allocater for the summer)  The
period of the NCP being the last 12 months (july to july).  This counts as
two studies.
The other two studies use the same system capacity and use as the respective
seasonal allocaters, the last five years average NCP by customer in Winter
and by customer in summer.

When you do these studies, would you also provide the definition used by El
Paso for Summer and Winter.  If you do not have one, we would suggest
November through April and May through October.

Please contact me with any clarifying questions.  1-800-883-8227.

After continuing to play musical chairs with the west eol products, I think 
we have decided on a plan.  Keith and Frank will handle the prompt and term 
basis.  This includes the monthly basis, daily basis, and gd index for SJ, 
ROX, Scal, CG, and Malin.   They will make certain that the gd index products 
are out there for all terms.  Cary Metz is managing the Perm products.

I will handle the prompt month physical fixed price and index for all of the 
index points.  The term physical index will be coming soon.

The rest of the group will continue to manage their cash index points for the 
next day trading, while adding the BOM physical with a basis link to 
Monique's GD BOM products.  I would like to get the cash products out on eol 
by 7:15 each morning.  The early info will come in handy as we approach 
winter.  Let me know what you think.   Steve and Matt have started a pilot 
program in the NW for rolling out their next day cash products after 11:00 am 
each day.  We will look into rolling out the SW in the future.

We are in the process of sending out the "odd lot" notice to our customers 
regarding all products on eol.  We will change our product minimum to one 
mmbtu in the next week.  You may want to discuss this with your direct 
customers before the mailout.    

With the addition of Olivia Newton-John to my Scour selection, it is no 
secret that we have a new commitment to physical in the west.  If you review 
your customer contact sheet and discover an old customer that we haven't 
contacted in some time, then call them and visit.  We will be using EOL and 
the brokers for physical volumes, but nothing beats the direct phone call for 
the baseload phys.

Thanks,

Mike

Kim:

Following our discussion of last Thur., we need to prepare the term sheet for 
Citizens. I want to focus on the TW deal first.  There are a number of things 
that I hope you can get from the desk by early afternoon my time, so we have 
time to do the term sheet.

I want to show them a structure that would give them right to call on gas 
each day.  What there be a demand charge?  What would be the Gas Daily 
adder?  High end of the range?  Mid point?  What would the demand charge be 
for mid-point of the range?  We would also compensate the desk to receive a 
demand charge equal to the full monthly cost of the lateral.  The desk should 
love that much of the structure.  Try to get some numbers from Janie.

 I have had numerous conversations with Citizens and TW.  TW will do the deal 
but want their liability limited to $140,000 year.  Citizens wants this 
liability increased to $1,000,000.  We could do this by buying insurance.  We 
might subcontract with TW to do this so the services deals is between ENA and 
Citizens. We would need to increase the demand charge to pay for this 
increase in laibility.

Once we know all our costs, we would bundle this together and then increase 
the demand charge for orig. 

Call me first thing on Monday

Several changes have been made to Stack Manager and the website. These changes are outlined below and will be visible by all as of Monday September 3, 2001.


Stack Manager Changes

Activate/Inactivate Stack - This functionality allows the trader to pull a product's prices from the website without suspending the product. If the Top of Stack limit order functionality is activated for a particular product this should be used to pull the stack prices from the website without pulling the entire product; therefore, if there are top of stack limit orders against the product they will remain visible and transactable on the website. 

If a product's stack is inactivated the font for that product will be grayed out in stack manager. If the stack is active it will appear in black font.

To use this feature, select the product, right click and choose "Inactivate Stack". When you are ready to reactivate your prices, select the same product, right click again and choose "Activate Stack". There are also icons on the tool bar at the top of your screen which will Activate/Inactivate the stack of the highlighted product. See screen shot below for the icons.

					 

Changes to Product Properties - Currently when modifications are made to certain properties within the product properties screen, the product will be suspended and pulled from the website. Now instead of being suspended, the product's stack will become inactive. Once the changes have been made and saved to the properties of a product simply click the Activate Stack icon as discussed above.


Website Change

Restrictions on Top of Stack orders - If Top of Stack limit orders are allowed on a product, but the trader is not showing both a bid and offer, limit orders will not be able to be placed on that product.


If you have any questions please call me at 31787. Thanks.

Savita

Enron announces UNLIMITED discounted AstroWorld tickets for employees.

Due to overwhelming employee feedback, we have negotiated unlimited 
discounted AstroWorld tickets for you and your family in place of the 
traditional "Enron Day At AstroWorld."  We hope this will allow Enron 
families to plan their fun-filled summer trips to AstroWorld at their own 
convenience.  Enron AstroWorld tickets are $20.56 (Retail $50), which 
includes admission for one, plus a $7 meal ticket to one of five restaurants 
at AstroWorld.

Six Flags AstroWorld is a world-class family entertainment complex filled 
with exciting rides and attractions, including 10 heart-pounding coasters, 
over  40 blockbuster shows, interactive street entertainers and star-studded 
concerts.  Enron families will be able to purchase unlimited tickets for use 
anytime during the 2001 season.

Tickets will be on sale at Enron's Federal Credit Union, EB0399.  Visit the 
credit union in person to make your purchases.  AstroWorld tickets will not 
be mailed.  Enron employees who are not already Enron FCU members may pay by 
cash or money order only.  All Enron Employees are encouraged to take 
advantage of this great summer fun deal and may purchase tickets through 
August 30th.

SRRS Decommissioning Notification

We are one @Enron

Effective Friday December 22, 2000, you will have a new Security Request=20
Database:

In the past, Enron Corporate/North American users have used the Security=20
Resource Request System (SRRS) lotus notes database for their security=20
request needs including New Hire/Contractor/Temporary access and=20
Terminations. In response to the business reorganization, the IT Security a=
nd=20
Controls group is working to streamline Enron=01,s Security Request structu=
re=20
and create one single request database for all groups to use, eRequest,=20
located at http://itcentral.enron.com/

Please click on the following link to retrieve the eRequest training guide:=
 =20

http://itcentral.enron.com/data/services/training/documentationurl/

A great deal of effort has been put into this project to eliminate any=20
duplicate security requests in Enron's Global Enterprise.  When you attempt=
=20
to access the SRRS through Lotus Notes on Dec. 22, you will find a link to=
=20
the new eRequest system. =20

If you have additional questions regarding your new security request or if=
=20
you have any problems with the eRequest system, please contact Information=

They are selling gas from Montebello.  

They have been given authority by the PUC to begin taking steps to sell from the remaining two (Alsio and La Goleta), but the PUC left some issues (principally around ratemaking) open, and have not given them the authority to actually begin selling the gas.  SoCal would like to start selling around Oct. 1, so they're expecting (hoping for) a decision in early September.  However, the state-run consumer group (ORA) and TURN have asked the Commission to require SoCal to retain two-thirds of the gas and sell it to the core at book value--unclear where the Commission will come out on that.

If there's anything else, let me know.

Best,
Jeff

Patti/Janie:

To recap the billing issue between EPMI and ENA with respect to the Harbor 
deal, as indicated on the attached spreadsheet, I believe EPMI ordered 
292,500 MMBtu at an average price of $4.65/MMBtu for a total of $1,360,125.   
Harbor Cogen used 288,574 MMBtu (this usage will be in the ENA SoCalGas 
imbalance statement).  ENA delivered 297,348 MMBtu in a pattern that resulted 
in a price above $4.65/MMBtu.  In the system right now, ENA is trying to bill 
EPMI 297,348 MMBtu at this higher price.  

So, there are two issues.  First, does Janie agree with my statement as to 
what EPMI bought, given that the Gas Daily arithmetic seems to be indicating 
a higher weighted average price than $4.65.   If not, let's get that on the 
table.  Janie could you let me know on that?  Secondly, how can we deal with 
this volume issue?  ENA can bill based on deliveries as this is how gas is 
typically sold.  ENA can bill based on usage as we do with accounts such as 
Jefferson Smurfit and Filtrol.  The concept of billing based on ordered is 
troublesome as if ENA were to try to bill on what EPMI ordered, this would 
make the imbalance calculation that Sherry A. does out of wack.    

So, to keep this simple, to address this volume issue on a go forward basis, 
an approach that might work is that ENA would bill EPMI on usage at the 
$4.65/MMBtu price (288, 574 @ $4.65/MMBtu).  And, it would be understood that 
EPMI would receive the first 3,926 MMBtu of August gas from ENA at a price of 
$4.65/MMBtu. This could easily be done by making a deal entry for a day in 
August that would adjust a price reflect the value of this imbalance.   This 
would be the way we would hanle it from now on.

Let me know what you think.

Teresa:  Irrespective of the above discussion, let's reduce Harbor's PX 
payment by $1,360,125 to reflect gas costs.  If we end up with something 
other than this we can catch it as a billing adjustment with the ISO 
payment.  

Thanks

Chris

In order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of EnronOnline we are rolling out several changes tonight, which will be in effect on Monday August 20, 2001. Some of these changes will affect Stack Manager while others affect the Website. A summary of these changes is listed below.

Stack Manager Changes

Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a " Top of Stack Entry" it will create back to back transactions; one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.

In order to turn on this functionality select the " Allowed Top of Stack" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the "Allowed"  option should be selected.

Please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out.

Restricted Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price. Stack Manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.  Orders will be queued by price and time stamp. When a counterparty trades on a " Top of Stack Entry" it will create back to back transactions one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.

In order to turn on this functionality select the " allowed as Restricted Top of Stack" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.  If regular limit order functionality is desired the "Allowed"  option should be selected. If a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the "Restricted Top of Stack" feature.

Advanced Filtering Ability on All Products Tab -  Drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the All Products tab in stack manager. In order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title. A drop down box with a list of attributes will appear. Highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter. To turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the " All" option from the drop down box.


Website Changes

New Submission Screen for Restricted Top of Stack Limit Orders -  The submission screen for  products that allow  Top of Stack or Restricted Top of Stack limit orders is as follows.
 

The submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction, while the button on the right will submit as a limit order.  In case of the Restricted Top of Stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box. 

Price of Limit Orders 

Modify Limit Orders
 Customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order. In order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on  at the top of the "Today's Orders" section. The price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product. Once the price is at the desired level click the "Set" button and the price will be modified. Another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order.  You will see a box with plus, minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order.

Expiration time for Limit Orders
Customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days. Currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours.

Float the Today's Orders Section
You can now float the " Limit Order " section. In order to do so, right click in the "Today's Orders " section and select the float window option. In order to make the window " Stay On Top " right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option.

Mid Market Client - Mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers, while including their desired margin on the trade, on EnronOnline products. In order to do so Click on the bid or offer price, a customised submission window will appear.  Select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit. For example if a customer wants to buy Nymex Sep 01 at 3.36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin, please enter 3.36 as the desired price and 0.01 as the margin. The system will trade the order when the EnronOnline offer for Nymex Sep 01 is at 3.35, book the trade at 3.36 and record the 0.01 origination amount.

In order to be set up to use this functionality. Please call the EnronOnline Product Control Group.

Changes to Website Passwords - As an added security measure, which has been requested by many customers, some new password rules have been instituted. First, the password cannot be equal to the login ID. Second, each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days. These rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users.


Please note  Stack Manager changes will be available all traders as of Monday August 20, 2001. The changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on Monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded Monday night, and external users by the end of the week.  Over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords.

If you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713-853-1787.
