Hi Chris, 

I just called you a while ago and they said you'd call me back.? I may not be 
at my phone when you call because I'm at my other desk for the rest of the 
afternoon.

I called to thank you for the goody package I received this afternoon.? 
Hector likes his golf shirt and my pen and pencil are very nice.? I've 
already tested them both.

I'm going to be visiting the New York customers this week and I'll probably 
take my new pen and pencil with me, if I can figure out a way to cover up the 
Enron part.

Hope you are well.? Let's talk soon so we can act like tomatoes and catchup.? 
:) 

Take care.?? ii

My flight is early Saturday morning... September 2nd. I should be home by
10
am. I leave late Monday night, 7 pm. I'll just catch a cab at the airport
on
September 2nd and will probably leave my car at the airport on September
4th.

Thanks again for everyone looking after my cat. If the sale of my condo
goes
as plan... I probably be back in Houston the following weekend to pack and
ship my stuff to Maryland. As these plans materialize, I'll let you know.

Alma, please continue to park in my space. I know you will have a rough
couple of months with your foot surgery. I'll just use your spot when I'm
home.

Thanks for everything... I'm so excited to come home!!!

Thanks for the update, Chris.  I had heard that Joe Parks took a job with
Bridgeline to trade NYMEX.  I also heard that Greg Schockling over there is
looking to leave.  I think that's why he's been putting me off when I ask
him about job opportunities over there.  Oh, well...

Talk to you later,

Susan

Bad news about Robin.  I hope she starts feeling better. This getting older
stuff is for the birds!!

I hope everything goes well with the birth.  You'll be pleased with a boy or
a girl, I'm sure.  Audrey and Christopher are both very nice names.  By the
way, my sister was a Judy, not Judith--my dad was responsible for that one.

Have you called Scott H. about the CMS job?  He might be a good match.  When
I last emailed with him, he said he was going to take some time off once he
was done at EnergyUSA.

As for working estate team, I don't think I could go back now.  Who knows
what horrible things I might say to Scott Neal??  He lied to me and was so
incredibly spineless when he told me I "wasn't part of the team" back in
December that I don't think I could stomach interacting with him on any
level.. You're on a different floor from them, right?  You probably still
see some of the UBS people though.  How is Judy?  I haven't heard from her
in a long time.  I emailed her a funny joke a while back but never heard
anything else from her.

Well, gotta go.  Take care and say hello to Ingrid for me.

Susan

Now for the good news, He wants to set in with the ya'll when you meet with
Mary.   I'd just have the meeting then tell him about it.  He also wants them
off the place in 14 days.   I told him no, to chill and that we will buy him
out.   That should hold him off a few days.   So don't move yet on getting my
money together?

Took Barb out to eat last night at Johnny Correno's.   No motorcycle riding 
for
me.

Oh yeah, Don is going to see the Dr. about something to help with his nerves 
and
to stop smoking.  He is going to tell him he is drinking with the stuff that 
he
is taking.   Maybe the Doc can give him something to help settle down all this
hostility.

I'll work on the inventory list tonight.   You need to pull together all the
finical data, CD's etc. that are out and that we  cashed in.   Then we will
stick in new values.  Also need to give a good fair market value on items we 
are
selling so we do not have to pay tax on the stuff right.  If we value the 
place
at $175,000 and sell for less, then we don't have to pay taxes on the money, 
so
I was told.


See Ya.

Update.  Spoke with the lawyer yesterday.  We can't buy Don out right now.
We need to turn in the final inventory list, get things resolved with Mary
(be it good or bad) then we can buy Don out.

She still thinks that we won't have any issues with Mary.  After we provide
the inventory list, she wants me to meet with her (Joal), Mary, and Mary's
lawyer to see what we need to do to get this CONFLICT resolved.  Joal
thinks we should be able to do this during the first 2 weeks of November.

I have a bad cold and I went scooter riding last night.  Do you care?

I can't blame brother too much, I still bounce back and forth between major
frustration and apathy on the East Texas issue.  Hope for the best!!

Later

wish you the best in fatherhood and marriage!!  they are beautiful and much
more rewarding than any job will ever be!

Keep in touch.

Just a quick note on the information I've sent you.  The following two
lines deal with the activity I've been involved in since Dec 2, 2001.
Some of my coworkers have said I should leave these lines out.  What do
you think?

		*	Buy and sale gas for the Enron Estate Team.
		*	Provide commercial evaluations on post-petition
deals to legal counsel.

Also, I sit right in the middle of the pack so it is a little awkward to
talk if everyone is here like they were yesterday.

Thanks

Dear Jerry:
First let me say that I am excited about having your family 92.5 Acres for
sale.
It is a good combination place and I feel there is a good market for it.

The mixture of woods, pasture, creek and home with a very private setting
are
some of the features that will have a great deal of appeal in today's
market.

I have completed the market analysis on the property and based on the
comparison of sales and asking prices of comparable properties and business
conditions in general at this time I  feel the market is indicating a
probable
sale price of $170,000 which figures out at about $1,300 per acre for the
land
and timber and the remaining $49,750 for the home and other improvements.

I have made an itemized estimate in the remarks section of the listing
agreement
of typical seller's closing costs for your review.

After you have had an opportunity to look over the agreement and talk with
your
brothers give me a call to answer any question you may have.

If the three of you feel you would like to begin marketing at a somewhat
higher
price and see what the market will bear we can do that. I have learned a
long time
ago that I can never say exactly what a place will or will not sell for. All
said and
done,  what a property will sell for is what a buyer is willing to give.

Our marketing efforts will expose your property to a good number of
qualified
buyers who are ready and able to buy, many of them for all cash.

Chris gave me his email address and I am send a copy of this letter and
attachments
to him also.

I do not have an email address for Don. You can forward on a copy to him.

Here is a brief outline of what you need to do before sending the papers
back to me.


1. Decide on the listing price and enter it in paragraph no. 1
2. Sign and return a copy of the "Information about Brokerage
      Services Form"
       3.   To the best of your ability complete the three page form called
      "Seller's Disclosure Notice". This is a form that discloses any
      information a buyer should be told about the  home on property.
      Initial the bottom of the first two pages and sign the last page.
4. For your convenience each of you can sign a separate listing
      agreement and Agency Relationship form and return them.
5. When returning these form we need the originally signed copy
      so return them in regular mail.
6. Please remember to include a key to the house and barn and
      give me the gate lock combination.

Call me if you have a question and I will be looking forward to hearing from

In anticipation of re-opening, you have an opportunity to pre-select your new 
locker location.  All active Body Shop members who had a permanent locker at 
the time of the September 1st construction close have been given first 
consideration when selecting their new locker location before December 29th.  
 Priority will be given to member's original locker location (i.e. a member 
who requests their original locker area will be given priority for that 
space).  After this date lockers will be distributed to members on the 
waiting list and to member's with permanent lockers who request a different 
space from their original locker area.   For your convenience, a Body Shop 
enrolment and locker request table will be in the lobby from December 18th 
through January 5th between the hours of 11am - 1:30pm. 



Follow these simple steps to secure your locker location:
Open and review the attached Men's Locker Design template.
Select your 1st, 2nd, and 3rd choice location preference.
Complete the Locker Selection Request Form.  
Complete and Sign the Locker Payroll Deduction Form.
Return all completed forms before December 29th to the Body Shop at EB1355, 
drop off at our offices on EB1372 or at the Body Shop Table in the lobby from 
December 18th through January 5th between the hours of 11am - 1:30pm.

You will receive an e-mail notifying you of your new locker location and 
locker combination prior to re-opening.  If you have any questions, please 
contact the Body Shop Front Desk at  x35547.

The new job  is great so far.  I am starting to get busy, which is good, but 
I am a little overwhelmed.  I really think I am going to like this rotation.  
The hours are good so far.  I get in at around 8:00AM and leave around 
5:30PM.  Pretty normal!  I have been relaxing a lot at night.  I am trying to 
save some money so I am not going out as much.  I have also been swimming at 
the YMCA  on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  That's all that's new over here.  

Stay warm on your motorcycle!!

How's the new job?  What do you do with yourself in the evenings now?

I see job #1154 (Origination - Wholesale) on the job posting board.  I am going to apply for it online (hopefully today).  I thought you said yesterday that there are two postings for your area.  Do you know if it has been posted yet or are you using job #1154 to fill both positions?

Thanks.

Hi all,

For those off you who don't already know, today is my final day as an employee of Enron.  With three years at this company under my belt (not to mention being a part of the US's largest bankruptcy and finding my name on lists for the FBI, SEC and FERC), I must say it's been an interesting ride.  Regardless of the unpleasant course of events over the last six months I truly enjoyed my time with Enron and most importantly the people I got to know as a result.  

You may be wondering where I am off to next...and I am more than happy to share.  I will be departing May 28th and winging my way to Paris (via a short stay in London).  I have decided to refer to this next move in my life as a sort of sabbatical.  Basically, I will be living in the heart of the city and taking language courses full-time...in-between the wine, cheese and museums of course!  Knowing how much people move around these days I wanted to make sure that everyone had my email address and encourage any of you who may be changing your own to let me know.

Take care and Au Revoir,
Susan

I've heard that there may be some job opportunities with Transwestern Pipeline.  They recently had an employee leave their marketing department.  I would like to talk to Kevin Hyatt and at least let him know that I may be interested in any future opportunities.  Would that be ok with you?

Mr. Germany,

How are things going?  You still pursuing JD's girl?  How's Corey doing?
Did you ever move into the bigger one-bedrooms at Bayou Park?  I hope so --
those studio apartments are too small.  How's Ingrid? doing?

As for myself, I have never been so busy in my life -- papers, group
projects, tests, etc.  I rarely have time to go out, and that really sucks
because the undergraduate women around here are just spectacular.  Granted,
they tend to be a bit bitchy (being rich daddy's girls and all), but they're
very easy on the eyes.  Anyway, if the trend continues, I doubt if I'll be
getting laid much during my two years at Vandy -- too many damn papers to
write!

Let me know how things are going.  I just got an e-mail from Jim; I think
I'll just be starting module 2 around Nov. 4, so I'll see if I can make it
down there.

In the meantime, my address here in Nashville is:

401 Village at Vanderbilt
Nashville, TN  37212
615/ 321-9648

Keep in touch,

Chad

Just in case you did not know, Randy's wife died last week. They will be 
having services today and tomorrow.  However, in lieu of flowers they would 
like donations for a playground in their neighborhood.  If you want to give a 
donation, please bring it by my desk.

Chris-

What about Transco Zone 3?

Hey, I'm coming by with a picture of Natasha for you.

It's a huge long-shot, of course, a shot in the dark, but, hey- what the 
hell. The hardest thing about meeting her would be her getting a visa to come 
here. They're almost unavailable except for family members of US citizens. 
And, you'd be uncomfortable travelling there without an "escort," so to 
speak, because you don't speak Russian.

  Collards is green, my dog's name is Blue 
  and I'm so lucky to have a sweet thang like you. 
  Yer hair is like cornsilk a-flappin in the breeze, 
  Softer than Blue's and without all them fleas. 
  You move like the bass which excite me in May. 
  You ain't got no scales but I luv you anyway. 
  Ye're as satisfy'n as okry jist a-fry'n in the pan. 
  Ye're as fragrant as "snuff" right out of the can. 
  You got some a yer teeth, for which I am proud; 
  I hold my head high when we're in a crowd. 
  On special occasions, when you shave under yer arms, 
  well, I'm in hawg heaven, and awed by yer charms. 
  Still them fellers at work,they all want to know, 
  What I did to deserve such a purdy, young doe. 
  Like a good roll of duct tape ye're there fer yer man, 
  To patch up life's troubles and to fix what you can. 
  Ye're as cute as a junebug a-buzzin' overhead. 
  Not like them mean far ants dun found in my bed. 
  Cut from the best cloth like a plaid flannel shirt, 
  You spark up my life like a load of fresh dirt. 
  When you hold me real tight like a padded gunrack, 
  My life is complete;there ain't nuthin' I lack. 
  Yer complexion is perfect like the best vinyl sidin'. 
  Cuz despite all them years,yer age, yup it keeps hidin'. 

  Me 'n' you's like a Moon Pie with a RC cold drank, 
  We two go together like a skunk goes with stank. 

  Some men, they buy chocolate fer Valentine's Day; 
  They git it at Wal-Mart, it's romantic that way. 

  Some men, they git roses fer that special day, 
  From the cooler at Kroger. "That's impressive," I say. 

  Some men buy fine diamonds from a flea market booth. 
  "Diamonds is ferever," they explains, suave and couth. 

  But fer this man, honey,these just won't do. 
  Cuz ye're way too special,you sweet thang you. 

  I got you a gift,without taste or odor, 
  More useful than diamonds...it's a new trollin' motor!

Hi, Chris!  It's good to hear from you.

Thanks for thinking about me.  I saw CMS's ad in Sunday's paper for that
position.  I sent my resume to them in response to an ad back in December,
and their HR folks called me in early January about an interview.  Then the
situation must have changed because then the HR lady acted like they didn't
really have a position to fill after all.  I've discovered that most HR
people are really lame (that's the nicest thing I can say!).  I'll call Curt
Lizzi; however, I think you're more qualified to trade NE physical than I
am.  I'm probably better suited for Gulf Coast.

I've been talking with Reliant and they may have a Gulf Coast position
available soon.  I'm not thrilled about some of the people there, but who
knows?  Duke may have a Gulf Coast position available because someone
recently quit; however, Renato works there now so I'm SOL.  I had a good
interview with them in late January when they didn't have the spot.  Since
then, Renato has started with them in their origination group.  Timing is
everything!!  Guess who Renato's working for?  Eric Gonzales, formerly of
Enron fame and fortune.  He's Dan's old buddy.

Robin might be interested in the CMS job.  Is she still working estate team
at Enron/UBS??  I haven't spoken with her since December.  I've had very
little contact with anyone there.  My last emails went unanswered, so I
decided to give up.

Good luck with your baby!  When is the due date?  I know you are both
excited.  It will be a real change in lifestyle but not a negative one,
believe me.

Take care,

Susan

Susan,

I got your email address from Scott Goodell.  I hope things are going well
for you and I don't know if you are working or staying at home so this may
be a non event.

CMS Energy is trying to develop a presence in the North East.  A headhunter
set me up with an interview at CMS last Friday.  I spoke with Curt Lizzi,
Vice President of Wholesale Gas Trading.  I don't know why he agreed to see
me because 30 min into the interview he said I wasn't what he was looking
for.  He wants someone with contacts and cash trading experience.  He said
he hopes to be looking for someone like me in about a year.  You just never
know.  His number is 713-230-7205.

Let me know how things are going.  ME??  just focused on living in sin with
a pregnant girlfriend.

Hi everyone!!

I made it and my bags finally showed up... almost had to do a shopping trip.

My apartment is right across from the office and is very nice. Maryland is
beautiful and the weather is great... nice and cool... in the 60/70's! I
need my sweaters already.... who would have thought.

TCO (the pipeline I scheduled) is taking us to the Orioles game Friday.

Please note my e-mail has changed slightly... I know... I said it wouldn't.
Gen changed to neg. Neg is for National Energy Group. It was gen for US
Generating.


joni.veselack@neg.pge.com


My Phone numbers:
301-280-6177 work
301-654-0508 home (still need to change my voicemail)

My address:
The Metropolitan
7620 Old Georgetown Road
Unit #214
Bethesda, MD  20814


Looking forward to hearing from y'all and your visits!!!

   It's a Party and You're Invited


   Occasion:  Farewell Party - Joni Veselack
  Day:  Sunday, September 10
  Time:  4:00 p.m.
  Place:  Woods on Augusta (pool area)

 I'm heading up north and didn't want to leave without having one
last get together around the pool!!! So, I decided to fire up the grill and
bbq.  I will have some snacks along with the bbq, but any side dishes or
desserts will definitely be enjoyed by one and all.

 Please bring your own "Cheer".

 Also, I need a head count for how much bbq to buy. (Get your minds
out of the gutter.) So, please let me know if you're attending.

We are pleased to present you with a 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Award.  As a participant in this grant you have the opportunity to share in the ownership of Enron and the potential profit from increases in the value of Enron's common stock.

The 2001 Special Stock Option Grant was made to let you know how valuable you are and to recognize your contributions in making Enron the great company it is today.   Although there are no guarantees as to Enron's future stock performance, we believe that an Enron stock option has tremendous future growth potential.  The value you ultimately receive from your options will depend on the price of Enron stock at the time you exercise your options.  

You can access your 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Agreement and the Stock Plan document governing the grant via your eHRonline account on the intranet website at http://ehronline.enron.com.  Unlike stock options granted in the past a copy of your grant agreement will not be mailed to your home address.  

Additionally, the following information regarding the 2001 Special Stock Option Grant can be found on the HR website http://hrweb.enron.com.

?	2001 Special Stock Option Grant Highlights
?	2001 Special Stock Option Grant Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
?	A "How to Exercise Options" document that contains contact information and PaineWebber forms applicable to your stock options

Please take time to review this material.  It is important to us and to you.  If you have any questions, please contact your Human Resources representative.

Thanks for sharing your pix with me.? I especially enjoyed the pictures of 
your father's tractor and his kids, very cute.? I'll be in the northeast this 
weekend, too.? I plan to go to an Italian festival in NYC on Fri nite (major 
food fest!) and on Saturday I'm touring wineries on Long Island.? Enjoy 
Maryland!

I'm glad you like your gifts.? I got tired of waiting on my assistant so I

I'm helping Joanie move to Maryland this weekend.? I'm out Friday, Monday, 
and Tuesday.

Hi Chris, 

I just called you a while ago and they said you'd call me back.? I may not 
be at my phone when you call because I'm at my other desk for the rest of 
the afternoon. 

I called to thank you for the goody package I received this afternoon. 
Hector likes his golf shirt and my pen and pencil are very nice.? I've 
already tested them both. 

I'm going to be visiting the New York customers this week and I'll probably 
take my new pen and pencil with me, if I can figure out a way to cover up 
the Enron part. 

Hope you are well.? Let's talk soon so we can act like tomatoes and 
catchup.? :) 

Take care.?? ii

I finished the ride!  I again want to say again to all of you for supporting my ride.  Your donation is for a good cause.  Finally, your cancelled check to the National MS Society will serve as your tax receipt.  Please send me an email if you have any questions.

Below is my story if you wish to read more.
=======================================

Prologue

Should I do it or not?  This was a question that had to be answered.....and soon.  This question had been lurking in the back of my mind since I'd already seen some gnarly bike crashes before and I've heard all the nasty stories about them.  So I was basically reluctant to do so, but I was obviously curious about it and so I had mixed feeling altogether.  I jumped on the internet for some perspective and discovered the pros and cons.  I figured, if I did happen to be involved in a pile-up, then I'd be sorry.  In the end, I did it.  In the tradition of cycling, I decided to shave my legs!

Day One - 100 miles

My alarm sounded off at 4:30 and I jumped out of bed, quickly dressed, and threw my gear into my Jeep and hit the road. The MS150 ride started at 7am.  And with 10,000 riders participating, my goal was to avoid as much traffic as possible.  Thankfully, the team I rode with (Sun & Ski Sport) started in the number two position.  bp, the corporate sponsor, started off the race.  It should be noted that my ride started at Tully Stadium (Dairy Ashford/I-10) as opposed to Rhodes Stadium (located in Katy) and so an extra 15 miles were immediately tacked on.

>From my POV, this day's ride was no different from any other I did in the preceding weeks other than the fact that it was longer by about 40 miles.  After the start and once the crowd thinned out, I got into my groove (after pulling over for a quick relief stop) and stayed within my own and kept a moderate speed with a high cadence.  The sun was above the clouds, but while en route a large, dark menacing cloud seemed to head my direction, but thankfully it amounted to nothing and the cloud cover remained most of the day.

I admit, my goal was to get to LaGrange as soon as possible without exerting too much energy early on.  In order to do this, I avoided the official rest-stops as much as possible.  When I did pull in for a snack or to refill my CamelBack with water, it was a long wait as there were a few hundred people at each stop.  At my first stop, I misplaced my cyclometer.  I removed it from my bike so that no one would steal it.  I got off my bike, stretched my legs, and loaded up on liquids and oranges.  On my way back to my bike, I noticed my cyclometer was neither in my hand nor in my jersey.  ****!  So I went back to the food table and asked the volunteers if they'd seen it (they had not), and I looked in the nearby trashcans.  No luck.  Now I was disappointed but I put it behind me.  On my way back to my bike, I SAW IT ON THE GROUND.  Whew!  So back on the road.

After a few more rest stops (to stretch and liquid-load) and even more roadside relief stops, I arrived in Bellville for lunch.  With my goal in mind, I quickly ate and hit the road again.  The ride became more scenic but my body began to get restless, namely my back, neck and rear end.  The sun broke the through the clouds and I began to sweat profusely.  To wipe away the sweat I used my "pedal partner" bandana.  My partner is someone named Kathryn who has MS.  The point of the program is to get to know this person and let them know that I was able to do what they could not because of the disease.

There were lots of spectators in LaGrange, and the campsite was not far the from city limits' edge.  The crowds lined the road for 1/2 a mile.  After I arrived at 2:40, I checked in my bike, went to the Sun & Ski team tent, got my clothes, took a cool shower (this was awesome), ate lunch, and waited for a massage.  I was obviously tired and tried to get a nap in but, with the sun up, it was difficult to do.  Eventually, I pulled The Sun Also Rises from my bag and began to read randomly (it's one of my favorite books).  I woke up an hour later feeling much better.  

By this time, it's around 7 o'clock and the sun is still up, so I wandered the campgrounds, ate some more, and visited friends on other teams.  Once the DJ closed shop and the staff began to make room for people to sleep, I setup camp in a quiet corner of the tent, stretched as much as possible and went to sleep.

My times on this day:  3'18" from Houston to Bellville, 23" for lunch, 3'52" from Bellville to LaGrange.  Total time = 7'34"

Day Two - 80 miles

No alarm was necessary on this day because the portable generators all seemed to fire up around the same time - 4:30.  It was hard to get out of bed but I eventually did.  I had to load my gear, fill my CamelBack, stretch, and wait in line for the start.  By 6:30 I was at the back of the pack and I did not like this.  From this vantage, I would not leave Bellville until after 8 o'clock.  I followed a misfit gang that tried to go another route to exit the campgrounds, but while doing so a "pppsssttt" sound came from my rear tire. That sounds means only one thing - a flat tire.  ****!  I went to the repair tent and found that the tire was sliced...either the tire was damaged or I walked over some glass.  The repair line was short and $29 was the damage for a new tube and tire.  On the bright side, I was closer to the start and got out on the road much earlier than I anticipated.

Overall, my body wasn't too tired and my legs felt okay.  The night before I stretched frequently, took gobs of Advil, and rested as much as possible.  I feared day two the most because word was out that the route had lots of hills and 80 miles is no easy task.  I deliberately started off slow just to get the blood flowing and to loosen up the muscles.  10 miles had past and I was fine.  I had to decide by mile 25 whether to go the hilly route (Bastrop State Park) or bypass it entirely.  

I talked to a few riders about it and chose to do the hills.  At mile 25 was the entrance to the park and a rest area.  I loaded up on liquids and decided to get a quick massage at the medical tent.  A rider told me he did this the day before and felt much better afterwards.  And so I was on the park course and the hills were short and steep.  The reward for climbing these hill was a well-deserved coast on the other side.  Then another hill.  And another...et cetera.  This was the case for about 10 miles.  The last hill was the most difficult.  The burn in my thighs and rear was more evident but I kept going.  My goal for this segment was to not stop.  Many others did but I went to my lowest gear and grinded it out.  After the last hill was the home stretch.  Lunch was minutes away at Bastrop H.S.

I was psychologically confident at this point since I only had 40 miles left and the hard part was behind me.  Upon immediate (and post-race reflection, I determined that the ride through the state park was the best part of the ride.  It had everything - shade, cooler air, no wind, hills, and a thinner road in which to maneuver.  It required me to focus, relax, and strategize on how to approach each hill.  Although I consider myself a beginner biker, I think I graduated to the intermediate level after than experience.

I still felt okay after the hills since I stretched quite well during lunch.  But I was back on the road because Austin was not going to get any closer with me staying in LaGrange.  I stopped at one rest area and pulled over another time.  Soon afterward, the "Austin 24" was in sight.  Only 24 more miles!  I was at my own pace when a rather large peloton passed by.  I decided to get on-board and kept with it for about 8 miles.  They were pedaling faster than I could keep up and I admit it took a lot out of me.  I knew the finish was near but my legs began to falter.

The final 5 miles was made up of more hills but it was the final stretch.  Many bikers were in their lowest gear including myself.  The path narrowed to about 8' since we were in the city and this made for dangerous conditions on the hills.  There is always a reckless biker who is interested in speed only and, unfortunately there was one such person near me who would pass me on the downhill at high speed, but I would pass him on the uphill.  Because of him, I nearly had a spill.  He came a little too close on a downhill.  We exchanged a few words and I deliberately slowed to let him pass.  Jerk!

And the crowds were there in Austin cheering us on.  One more dip and hill and the finish line was near.  Could this be the end?  It was.  I took my final picture of the finish line and was thankful that I finished.  I rarely go to Austin but when I do, it's on a bike.  Funny, huh?

Now I'm hungry, very hungry but I need to check in at the Sun & Ski tent, claim my luggage, shower and then finally eat.  To do this took about 1.5 hours because of the many other people wanting to do the same thing.  I probably ate too many cookies but my appetite was very strong and I didn't care what I ate at this point.  The Hooter's chicken sandwich was not enough to satisfy my hunger, but the two Shiners I had satisfied my thirst.

It was time to go home, so I claimed my bus ticket, loaded my bags and boarded the bus with my pillow.  The people on board had lots of enthusiasm as we exchanged stories and experiences.  This lasted for about an hour and we all seemed to fall asleep at the same time.  I woke up with lots of drool on my pillow and felt a little better.  Food was on my mind again and, by this point, I just wanted to be at home in my bed.  We pulled into Tully Stadium, I claimed my bike, drove home, and went to sleep.

My times on this day:  3'25" from LaGrange to Bastrop, 44" for lunch, 2'42" from LaGrange to Austin.  Total time = 6'51"

TOTAL BIKING TIME (including lunches) = 14'26"

Subject: New Virus Alert !!!




New Virus Taking Offices By Storm
  This virus warning is genuine.

There is a new virus going around, called "work."   If you receive any sort
of "work" at all, whether via email, Internet or simply handed to you by a
colleague...DO NOT OPEN IT.

This has been circulating around our building for months and those who have
been tempted to open "work" or even look at "work" have found that their
social life is deleted and their brain ceases to function properly.  If you
do encounter "work" via email or are faced with any "work" at all, then to
purge the virus, send an email to your boss with the words "I've had enough
of your crap...  I'm off to the bar."    Your brain should automatically
forget the "work".

If you receive "work" in paper-document form, simply lift the document and
drag the "work" to your garbage can.  Put on your hat and coat and skip to
the nearest bar with two friends and order three bottles of beer  (or rum
punch). After repeating this action 14 times, you will find  that "work"
will no longer be of any relevance to you  and that "Scooby Doo" was the
greatest cartoon ever.

Roses are red.
Violets are blue.
You're a pain in the ass,
But I s'pose I am, too.

So oft when we meet,
We fuss and we fight.
It becomes hard to see
That we share a love of great might.

But no matter the tears,
Or gut wrenching fears.
As we grow old,
We create a togetherness,
Lovely to behold.

xoxo

Chris,
 
        Thanks again for taking a few moments  to speak with me.  We appreciate you letting us help you out in preparing  for your impending "life after Enron."
 
        Please don't be overwhelmed by the  detail we ask for in the forms.  The reason we ask for such detail is that  this information, along with your resume and any verbal help you can offer, is  what we will use in preparing a marketing presentation for whichever suitors you  choose.  We take this information, work with you to promote your most  attractive professional assets, and hope to create a bidding war for your  services.
 
    With the quality of people that are in the market right  now (most of whom you know and/or used to work with), we are finding that some  companies will even make an opening for the right person with the right track  record.  Your ability to create $1.6 million last year, while working under  Enron's credit issues, will speak highly of you.  I am sure that  we will find you a new position when you are ready.  At MRI,  we are growing our credibility and increasing our options with every placement;  be sure to thank the guys you know that we have placed when we get you a better  position than what they have!
 
    In addition to this information, we also need you to put  together a list of companies (as many as you can think of) that you would like  to work for and a list of 12 references.  I'm sure Al told you most of  that, but I just wanted make sure.  Don't put yourself under too much  pressure to get that stuff done completely; we'll work through whatever you want  clarified over the phone.
 
    If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate  to call me at 713/627-0880.  You can also e-mail me at jeffk@schouston.com . Thanks again for  letting us help you out.
 
Sincerely,
Jeff Keene

did you count the half day on 4/16 or all day on 4/19 or should we leave these as unofficial time?

               It's a Party and You're Invited


      Occasion:  Farewell Party - Joni Veselack
      Day:     Sunday, September 10
      Time:    4:00 p.m.
      Place:   Woods on Augusta (pool area)

     I'm heading up north and didn't want to leave without having one
last get together around the pool!!! So, I decided to fire up the grill and
bbq.  I will have some snacks along with the bbq, but any side dishes or
desserts will definitely be enjoyed by one and all.

     Please bring your own "Cheer".

     Also, I need a head count for how much bbq to buy. (Get your minds
out of the gutter.) So, please let me know if you're attending.
