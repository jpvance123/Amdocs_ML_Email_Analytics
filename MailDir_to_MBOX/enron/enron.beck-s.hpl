attached is a quick cut at the 2001 Budget adjustments for HPL.

Total Budget for 2001 was $6.2.  Saving for the remainder of year assume
sale completes by June 1 could be a possible $2.6.

This is just based upon Headcount reduction.

Let me know what you think/

thanks

bob

Subject: 2001 Anticipated Budget Adjustments for HPL Sale

During the budgeting process for 2001 I gave Dave Delainey an estimated cost 
savings for Energy Operations assuming the sale of HPL. Since this is clearly 
on the horizon, we need to take a close look at opportunities for cost 
savings and our estimated timing on those savings.  I will ask James by copy 
of this memo to set up a meeting late this week to cover this.  I want to be 
able to get back with Dave with more detailed estimates of cost savings.

Carol, thanks.

Anne:  we need to send this list to AEP to ensure they agree that this is the 
extent of our "Books and Records" obligations at Close.

Thanks,

Sally and Brian,
Per my conversation with Brian regarding HPL books and records to be turned 
over to AEP, we will complete the identification and inventory report of 
records to be turned over by close of business Thursday, April 26, 2001.  We 
will continue to track and monitor the location of these records during the 
transition of personnel from Enron to AEP.  In order to ensure delivery of 
the HPL/AEP Records Transfer List, we have increased the resources from three 
to ten individuals.

Please call me if you need further clarification or have any comments or 
concerns.

Thank you,

meet every week until the receivables balance is at zero.

Thanks

Dwayne and Gary,

At the request of Brian Redmond, I have prepared and am forwarding to you a 
draft of an Amendment to the Purchase and Sale Agreement that will reflect 
the agreement that the HPL Bank Accounts will be retained by Enron after the 
closing and that AEP will set up its own new HPL accounts at its preferred 
banks after closing.   It is my understanding from Mary Perkins of Enron that 
the procedures set out in the amendment were agreed to by Jana Soward of 
AEP.    Please review the enclosed and let me know if you have any 
comments.    We would like to get this one issue resolved and out of the way 
as soon as possible.  Thanks and hope you both are doing well.

Subject: Sale of HPL

To all: 

The proposed sale of HPL to American Electric Power (AEP) has been signed and 
the conditions for the acquisition should be completed within the coming 
months.  Over the next few days, I will be forwarding more details about the 
transition process.  These details will outline the employment opportunities 
and transfer process to AEP.   AEP is eager to complete these arrangements, 
as the pipeline is only as valuable as the people who operate it.

During the transition period, it is important that we keep the pipe line 
operating at our historical level of reliability in order to meet the energy 
needs of our customers.

Regards,
Brian

Sally,
James asked that I send you this schedule of the headcount and cost 
reductions (savings) that will result with the sale of HPL.  If you have any 
questions, or would like to schedule a time to go over the information, 
please let me know.
Thanks,

Sally,

Thanks for our meeting last week.  Please let me know if you don't think 
we've sufficiently defined the deliverable for Business Ops.  Based on 
feedback from Louise - you and I still may not be clearly communicating yet 
as to what is required.

Specifically, AEP and Enron need to agree in writing for each Business Ops 
"process" or function:

1. Who is going to carry out the Business Ops processes before and after 
close.
2. How control over the process will be handed over from Enron to AEP.
3. The necessary IT actions required to put the required system functionality 
in place (and who is responsible for implementing this). 

The table you developed at the end of last week (based on Bob's email) moves 
closer to this point.   As we discussed on the phone, we need to provide a 
description of the deliverables for each of the "systems/activities" you 
listed on the table and ensure that AEP understands (and signs off on) what 
they are responsible for.  To Anne's point, this "sign off" can be through a 
memo, protocol, acknowledged email, or other.  

We have been having a problem in that one part of AEP does not talk to the 
other part.  So, I would like to encapsulate and elevate the individual Bob 
Hall/Steve Jackson discussions so that all relevant levels of AEP (and Enron) 
understand what is being agreed before we close.

Each Tuesday at 4:00 we have a standing HPL Transition Coordination meeting 
to discuss the status of the deliverables from each group.   You are welcome 
to attend this meeting or the separate meeting we have now established each 
Wednesday with Bob H. and Tommy Y. to concentrate on HPL/IT/Business Ops 
matters.

Sally,  thanks for you personal attention to this.    

The quicker we close the quicker Bob can focus more of his time on Network's 
origination efforts.

Regards,
Brian

Subject: HPL Sale - Energy Operations Task List

I talked with Anne Koehler in Legal today to determine her understanding of 
what is required from Energy Operations prior to the effective sale of HPL.  
Anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term "protocol" 
into these discussions.  To clarify, according to Anne, the "protocol" is not 
anticipated to be a formal legal document.  Instead, Anne envisions simply 
e:mails or memos between Enron and AEP with regard to any sharing of 
information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc.  
Operational details to be decided between Enron and AEP have been handled 
exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from Bob Ball (Enron) 
to Steve Jackson (AEP).  

Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally 
documented.  Bob Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the 
original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for 
gas to be delivered in the month of May.  He has worked with Enron's treasury 
group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with Sandi Braband 
in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an 
Amendment to that agreement.   As of today, Legal has completed revisions to 
that amendment and Anne Koehler is sending it to Mary Perkins in Enron's 
Treasury group for her review.  Upon Mary's review, Anne will forward the 
amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures.  

We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition 
issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of 
you.  This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have 
to date captured the status of transition issues.  Items that only require 
actions by Enron will be our "to do" list.  Each item has a due date and we 
will update you weekly on progress.  Those items that fall under the AEP list 
or which appear in both the Enron and AEP list will be the items to which we 
will evidence communication to AEP and/or their agreement via the e:mails or 
memos as suggested by Ann Koehler.  I believe that this should satisfy your 
requests earlier this week for written "protocol".   We will also update you 
weekly on the status of those e:mails and/or memos between ourselves and 
AEP.  

I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update 
on the HPL sale.  To provide clarity for these update meetings, may I suggest 
that we incorporate one of the following two approaches: 

 1)  Brian and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so 
that Brian has a full   understanding of operational transition items and 
their status, or 

 2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a 
firsthand update to the two of you.  

Please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can 
incorporate that into our schedules for next week.

Sally and Brian,
Per my conversation with Brian regarding HPL books and records to be turned over to AEP, we will complete the identification and inventory report of records to be turned over by close of business Thursday, April 26, 2001.  We will continue to track and monitor the location of these records during the transition of personnel from Enron to AEP.  In order to ensure delivery of the HPL/AEP Records Transfer List, we have increased the resources from three to ten individuals.

Please call me if you need further clarification or have any comments or concerns.

Thank you,
Carolyn Gilley

Fran,

List below are some questions that HPL personnel are asking:

What will happen if I tell AEP I do not want an offer?

We have heard from pretty reliable sources that AEP only wants 60 to 75 
employees.  Do we know anything about this??

Can I post, even though I have only been in my current job less than one year?

What happens to my balance in the current pension plan (cash part)?

What happens to my options left to vest?

Will my time at Enron bridge to AEP for vacation and retirement?

Will Enron review all of the offers to make sure they are equivalent?

Who will decide if it is an equivalent offer?

If it is not an equivalent offer, how long before 1) I am severed from Enron, 
2) how long will I
be in the redeployment pool? 3). What will the severence package look like?  
4) When will 
severence be paid?

Let me know.  I'll keep gathering the questions.

thanks

bob

Sally,

Thanks for our meeting last week.  Please let me know if you don't think we've sufficiently defined the deliverable for Business Ops.  Based on feedback from Louise - you and I still may not be clearly communicating yet as to what is required.

Specifically, AEP and Enron need to agree in writing for each Business Ops "process" or function:

1.	Who is going to carry out the Business Ops processes before and after close.
2.	How control over the process will be handed over from Enron to AEP.
3.	The necessary IT actions required to put the required system functionality in place (and who is responsible for implementing this).	

The table you developed at the end of last week (based on Bob's email) moves closer to this point.   As we discussed on the phone, we need to provide a description of the deliverables for each of the "systems/activities" you listed on the table and ensure that AEP understands (and signs off on) what they are responsible for.  To Anne's point, this "sign off" can be through a memo, protocol, acknowledged email, or other.  

We have been having a problem in that one part of AEP does not talk to the other part.  So, I would like to encapsulate and elevate the individual Bob Hall/Steve Jackson discussions so that all relevant levels of AEP (and Enron) understand what is being agreed before we close.

Each Tuesday at 4:00 we have a standing HPL Transition Coordination meeting to discuss the status of the deliverables from each group.   You are welcome to attend this meeting or the separate meeting we have now established each Wednesday with Bob H. and Tommy Y. to concentrate on HPL/IT/Business Ops matters.

Sally,  thanks for you personal attention to this.    

The quicker we close the quicker Bob can focus more of his time on Network's origination efforts.

Regards,
Brian

Subject:	HPL Sale - Energy Operations Task List

I talked with Anne Koehler in Legal today to determine her understanding of what is required from Energy Operations prior to the effective sale of HPL.  Anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term "protocol" into these discussions.  To clarify, according to Anne, the "protocol" is not anticipated to be a formal legal document.  Instead, Anne envisions simply e:mails or memos between Enron and AEP with regard to any sharing of information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc.  Operational details to be decided between Enron and AEP have been handled exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from Bob Ball (Enron) to Steve Jackson (AEP).  

Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally documented.  Bob Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for gas to be delivered in the month of May.  He has worked with Enron's treasury group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with Sandi Braband in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an Amendment to that agreement.   As of today, Legal has completed revisions to that amendment and Anne Koehler is sending it to Mary Perkins in Enron's Treasury group for her review.  Upon Mary's review, Anne will forward the amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures.  

We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of you.  This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have to date captured the status of transition issues.  Items that only require actions by Enron will be our "to do" list.  Each item has a due date and we will update you weekly on progress.  Those items that fall under the AEP list or which appear in both the Enron and AEP list will be the items to which we will evidence communication to AEP and/or their agreement via the e:mails or memos as suggested by Ann Koehler.  I believe that this should satisfy your requests earlier this week for written "protocol".   We will also update you weekly on the status of those e:mails and/or memos between ourselves and AEP.  

I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update on the HPL sale.  To provide clarity for these update meetings, may I suggest that we incorporate one of the following two approaches: 

	1)  Brian and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so that Brian has a full 		understanding of operational transition items and their status, or 

	2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a firsthand update to the two of you.  

Please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can incorporate that into our schedules for next week.

Dwayne and Gary,

At the request of Brian Redmond, I have prepared and am forwarding to you a draft of an Amendment to the Purchase and Sale Agreement that will reflect the agreement that the HPL Bank Accounts will be retained by Enron after the closing and that AEP will set up its own new HPL accounts at its preferred banks after closing.   It is my understanding from Mary Perkins of Enron that the procedures set out in the amendment were agreed to by Jana Soward of AEP.    Please review the enclosed and let me know if you have any comments.    We would like to get this one issue resolved and out of the way as soon as possible.  Thanks and hope you both are doing well.
