The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 05:00 and 17:00 in the
January 24, 2002 Real-Time Market.

In addition, the NYISO is reserving hours beginning 11:00, 13:00 and 15:00
in the Hour-Ahead locational reserve market.

Prices in the January 25, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements

If you have not yet had the opportunity to enroll for the 2002 CFA exam, AIMR is pleased to announce that you now can do so electronically through the AIMR Web site at http://www.aimr.org/cfaprogram/index.html.

The next enrollment deadline is 3 December 2001 and, as a reminder, this year AIMR must RECEIVE your enrollment form and payment by the deadline date.

Many CFA candidates have inquired about the status of the New York Society, which had its office in the World Trade Center. We are happy to report that all NYSSA staff escaped safely on 11 September, that the organization is relocating to midtown Manhattan, and that is up and running with a full slate of educational programs. Visit http://www.nyssa.org for information about NYSSA's Fall and Spring continuing education and CFA review courses, and seminars.

Ben -

I likewise was glad to see you.  Sorry we didn't have a chance to talk.

Good to hear you're doing well.  You're with a great group and, yes, the company will soon be doing a lot better.

Thanks,

Ken

Mr. Lay:
It was good to see you down on the trading floor today.  I have been in the power trading group for about a year now.  I came over from the corp. development group after we sold the peakers to Allegheny and to Cinergy.  I was the one who convinced my Dad to buy those two peakers.
The power trading group is a really solid group of individuals.  Sitting where I do I see and hear alot of what goes on in the heart on Enron and I feel that this part of the company is doing really well.  
I have been with Enron for over four years now and I continue to learn alot as well as contribute to Enron's bottom line.  Eventhough Enron's stock price has come off a little I still think this is a great company and that the overall fundamentals are very sound.  I hope all is going well! 

Regards,
Ben

-- This week TWST has an interview with the President and CEO and
a Director of CDI Corp.  He states, "CDI today is an outsourcing and staffing
company. We are leaders in several of the areas we participate in. We've got
four major lines of business or reporting segments. Our Management Recruiters
International business is the world's leading recruiting company. Our Today's
Staffing business is a regional player in clerical and administrative temporary
staffing. Then we have our Professional Services business, which is higher-end
technology and technical services staffing in targeted industries; we're one of
the leaders in those spaces. And we've got our Project Management business,
specializing in engineering and information technology outsourcing."  He states,
"Clearly, there's huge opportunity in the Project Management businesses.
Outsourcing is a trend that's going to continue and, in fact, accelerate. Most
corporations are becoming more disciplined at sticking to their core
competencies and outsourcing the rest. They're getting more financially
disciplined in looking to manage on a steady run rate of staffing and, for
peak-and-valley effects, to outsource projects. I think there's a tremendous
boom coming in outsourcing in general. And then there are some specific
industry sectors that I think are very attractive, some targeted vertical markets,
a good example being health care, where there's going to be a tremendous
opportunity for us."  To read more of
this interview excerpt, click on http://www.twst.com/notes/articles/nax611.html.

-- We also have an analyst interview with the Director and Senior Analyst in the
Equity Research department at Robert W. Baird & Company.  He highlights Manpower.
"Manpower is another interesting pick, for reasons I discussed earlier -
improved mix, management, and margin potential. The current estimates are
depressed. I think Manpower can potentially do $2.50 per share in 2003, and
trade at 20 times that number - and the stock is only mid-$30s today."

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

On Saturday, 11/17, the Operational Announcements  state that both Roseton units would be committed for Local  Reliability on Sunday.  I have two questions concerning this  commitment; 1) What happened after SCUC ran that required two 600 mw units be  put on at minimum?  2) Since the local Transmission Owner didn't request  these units on, why is it referred to as Local Reliability?  There is a  substantial amount of uplift generated ( no pun intended ) by this decision and  when the term Local Reliability is used it raises a question as to the  allocation of this cost.

Ben,

I was again good to talk with you and I look forward to the
possibilities. As we spoke of, Joe Toussaint is heading up the talent
initiative and coordinating the recruiting process. I spoke with Joe
today and he informed me he had left several contact numbers for you so
I will at this point step out of the middle of process to allow for a
more coordinated approach. I'm sure I speak for Joe when I say we
believe the changes in the industry as well as Enron provide opportunity
for us both.

Please provide Joe with your resume as soon as you can and as we
discussed be prepared to discuss your desires, skills and/or experiences
you believe uniquely qualify you, as well as examples of your ability to
create value.

Again it has been my pleasure and I'm sure Joe or his designee will
contact you concerning your trip to Cincinnati and scheduled activities
next week.

Michael J. Cyrus
President & CEO, Cinergy, Energy Merchant

[IMAGE] "I'm writing to tell you about a flight I just purchased through my Active Advantage membership. A last-minute trip came up where I needed to fly from New York to San Diego.  I checked a bunch of online travel sources and found fares between $2,257.50 and $2,263. When I checked through Active Advantage, the same flight was $698 - that's almost 70% off.  I booked my flight and my trip went off without a hitch.  This is a great program. Thanks." Scott C. Active Advantage Member While we can't guarantee you'll save $1,500 on your next flight, with Active Advantage you'll get the best discounted rates on flights, hotel rooms, rental cars, sports gear and more. There's a reason why we're the fastest growing member savings program for active people, anywhere.  Don't wait. Catch the Active Advantage right away.    [IMAGE]

=============================================================================

-- This week TWST has an interview with the President and Chief Executive Officer
of Automodular Corporation.  He states, "Automodular Corporation began in
1989 when it entered a very specialized field called sequencing. Sequencing
is the assembly of modules for the automotive assembly plants in sequence
with the final production. What's unusual about the business is that our plants
have to be located within a few kilometers of the final assembly plants and
receive orders every few seconds."  He states, "Our strategy is to continue to
expand our sequencing business, both at the current level, which we call
Tier-Two, where we only bill our customers for the services we provide and not for
the materials we handle and at a Tier-One level. So when we dress an engine, we
don't buy the engine and then sell it to the customer; the engine comes to us on
consignment, and we just bill for the cost of the value-added we're putting on it.
We're bidding on contracts now that are in what, in the industry, is called a
Tier-One level, where we would purchase the material, perform our operations and

Ben, I am not sure if I forwarded this to you yesterday, what do you think, is there something more you would like to see this have?  Or should
I meet with Mike and come back to you with suggestions between us?  Let me know when you get a chance.

Bryce,

	I have a couple idea's for this model and I'd like to know what you think. I would like to create one model which would have the potential to encompass a larger amount of information. I could create a similar model which would have basically the same format but allow you to select which zones you would like to view. We could even allow the selection of which region if needed. This could save us alot of time and energy by not having to make small changes which take too much time. I'm free pretty much all morning tomorrow if you would like to get together for about 30 minutes or so and discuss. 

Thanks,
Mike

The NYISO is reserving no hours in the January 20, 2002 Real-Time Market.

In addition, prices in the January 21, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

We want YOU to join New York Road Runners! And if you join or renew your
membership this week, you'll receive 20% off all merchandise, double the
usual 10% member discount! Remember, if you're a member for the full year
(starting by January 31, 2002) and complete nine qualifying races, you'll
be guaranteed entry to the 2003 New York City Marathon.

To join or renew your membership, please visit
http://www.nyrrc.org/membership. Then, go to our online store

everything from technical gear to books and gifts to Official New York City

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

Transactions, the NYISO will be implementing new Bid Caps for Day-Ahead
and Hour-Ahead EXTERNAL transactions. (Pre-Scheduling of transactions is
a project the NYISO is currently working on with support from the Market
Structures Working Group.  An overview of the project can be found on the
NYISO web site under meeting materials for the Market Structures Working
Group.)

The new bid caps will become effective for Day-Ahead and Hour-Ahead bids
for the March 28, 2002 market.

For both Day-Ahead and Hour-Ahead EXTERNAL transactions, the new bid caps
will be +/- $999.70 for import Decremental Bids and for export Sink Price
Cap Bids.

Any bid input for the March 28, 2002 market and beyond must use the new bid
cap for maximum priority status.  Bids input for evaluation up to and
including the March 27, 2002 market may continue to use the $1000.00 price
cap if maximum priority is desired.

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
representative or the Help Desk at 518-356-6060.

Regards,

Customer Relations

Stan:
Its been a very interesting ride these last four and a half years here.  I received an offer from UBS, but decided to turn it down for personal reasons.  These last few weeks I have been with the estate working on selling certain assets.  Tomorrow is my last day with the estate and then I am off to Ohio and Cinergy to continue trading.  I will also begin to learn the oprations of Cinergy as well as go back and get an executive MBA at Chicago.  Ultimately, I want to learn more about the overall operations and effective energy risk management.  
I just wanted to thank you for all you have done while I have been here.  I look back and think that I should have spent time in the pipeline group.  Even after all that has happened I certainly wouldn't change what I have experienced.  Thanks again for being such a good friend.  Hope you are doing well and good luck with everything.  I will send you my new information at Cinergy.  My Dad would love to hear from you sometime.
Regards,
Ben

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"Kirkpatrick, Joe" <joe.kirkpatrick@nrgenergy.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

In order to have a functioning market model it is imperative to have a
level playing field for all market participants.

Is it a level playing field or even appropriate for any individual
market participant to dispatch generation and transmission facilities
that affect the economics of other market participants? The dispatch of
transmission and generation to resolve congestion must be made with the
overall economics of the entire market in mind. The only entity that has
the information and empowered to make these decisions is the NYISO.

With that in mind why does a particular market participant have control
over major interfaces that interconnect New York and PJM. Specifically
the control points would be the Linden-Goethals phase angle regulator
and the Hudson Farragut phase angle regulators. These PARs are under
ConEd control and are utilized by ConEd to facilitate whatever
requirements they deem required. As this is being written the New York
PJM schedule is 546 MW out to New York with a flow of 762 MW the flow on
these PARs (including Ramapo) is ~1500 MW to New York.

Are the interests of all market participants being considered by a
market participant that has over 40% of the load in New York State, that
has control over a significant amount of generation utilizing OOM
dispatches and by having control over a significant amount of
transmission facilities capable of altering the flow into New York City
and Central x East.

I suspect not.

Case in point..

There is a transmission constraint in an area in New York city. This
constraint can only be monitored by ConEd and therefore is resolved
utilizing an OOM dispatch request. Generation was reduced to resolve the
constraint, there is another generator in the area that can be reduced
to resolve the constraint, but it would appear that this control action
is not utilized . Coincidently the power from this other generator is
under contract to ConEd (take-or-pay). There is also a PAR
(Linden-Goethals) that can be moved to alleviate the constraint, which
unfortunately is not utilized either. Instead generation is reduced that
does result in additional uplift charges that is socialized as a cost to
all loads in New York. Whether the right economic decisions are being
made is an issue but the larger issue is why is a market participant
with a large economic interest making these decisions.

The NYISO was asked why the PAR was not utilized as a control action to
alleviate the constraint, simply put since the PAR is not under their
control they do not consider it as a control action.

Since ConEd does not have the overall market view or the economic
interests of all market participants in mind is it appropriate to allow
them to operate and dispatch a large part of New York State?

When the NYISO is not controlling major inter-area transmission
interfaces but allows that control to be utilized by a market
participant it is a compromise of the entire market. Economics of an
individual market participant are overriding the economics of all other
participants in New York.

This is not a "best practice" that any sane individual would recommend
for any RTO model.

Ben,
I don't know who you may know on the trading side.  Goldman Sachs is looking
for a Senior Power Trader, paying anywhere from 150-180 on a base salary
with the bonus ranging anywhere from 3-500k.  They will guarantee the
compensation for the first year.  Do you know of anyone falling out there
who might be interested?  I appreciate the referrals.
Thanks,
Rosanna

barkerde@nmenergy.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



Joe has brought up some great  points once again. As Tom has pointed out that
the NYISO should be in the forefront in addressing this. Since 1999 the PAR
issue has been brought up time and time again, both in committees and in direct
complaints to the NYISO. The ball is squarely in the NYISO's court. I, would
like to see on this forum, an update/discussion from the NYISO addressing Joe's
concerns. If nothing else it would bring everyone up to date on where we are on
this issue. All too often good points are brought up on this forum, just to die
because there was no NYISO imput or the answer was off line.

@TIMES - Inside NYTimes.com
Tuesday, January 15, 2002
-----------------------------------------------------

Dear NYTimes.com Member,

One of the most meaningful features to appear in The New
York Times and on NYTimes.com is Portraits of Grief. This
feature first began running on September 15 and presented
brief profiles of World Trade Center victims. On December
31 the final daily edition of Portraits of Grief appeared
in The New York Times newspaper. A book will be published
this year, and the feature will continue to appear from
time to time, as more names become known and more families
agree to interviews.

In the meantime, we invite you to visit the Web site to
see a complete collection of Portraits of Grief,
alphabetized and listed by day. This archive represents
all the Portraits published to date. They will remain at
NYTimes.com indefinitely.

http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/portraits/?rd=hcmcp?p=041_Fz041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm

Another recent special feature has been the multimedia
photo essay. We have already talked here about the essays
done by Vincent Laforet and James Hill. I would now like
to direct your attention to the newest, this one by Times
staff photographer Ruth Fremson about the women in
Afghanistan. The essay features a very strong audio
commentary, which makes the point that not all the women
feel the same about the head-to-toe veil they were
required to wear under the Taliban's rule: in fact, many
are very comfortable dressed as they are.

http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/dayofterror/index.html?rd=hcmcp?p=041_Ja041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm

We have enjoyed participating in almost daily
"conversations" with correspondents of The New York Times.
In these unstructured talks, each correspondent provides
information not only about the news he or she is covering,
but on what life is like in the particular place he or she
is located. There are over 50 discussions now available
for listening in audio format.

http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/23/national/_begwer-audio.html?rd=hcmcp?p=041_FW041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm

The Winter Olympics games at Salt Lake City begin soon and
NYTimes.com already has started covering this event. Our
Olympics section covers security concerns, athlete
profiles and an interactive map of the torch relay.
Special e-mail updates are now available, and include
periodic countdown reports and details of the torch run,
athlete profiles and event previews. When the games begin
on Feb. 8, we'll send daily dispatches with event results
and exclusive "postcards" from Salt Lake City by Times
sports reporter George Vecsey.

http://www.nytimes.com/pages/olympics/index.html?rd=hcmcp?p=041_Ev041_GM4Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm

by the New York Times staff.

------
7. For students, "TEST" doesn't have to be a four-letter
word
------

The Learning Network's Word of the Day and Test Prep
Question of the Day help students build their vocabulary
for upcoming standardized tests in ways that are fun and
interactive. Every weekday there's a focus on a different
word -- its definition and an example of its use in the
context of a recent Times article; and students can then
test their understanding online with the day's analogy or
sentence completion question.

Thanks for your time.

Yours truly,

 Two couples were playing cards one evening. John accidentally dropped  some cards on the floor. When he bent down under the table to pick them up, he noticed that Bill's wife's legs were wide apart, and she  wasn't wearing any underwear!

Shocked by this, John upon trying to sit back up again, hit his head on the table & emerged red-faced. Later, John went to the kitchen to get some refreshments. Bill's wife followed & asked, "Did you see anything that you liked under there?"

Surprised by her boldness, John admitted that, well, indeed he did.   She said, "Well, you can have it but it will cost you $500."  After taking a minute or two to assess the financial situation as well as the moral costs of this offer, John says that he is indeed interested.  She tells him that since her husband, Bill, works Friday afternoons & John doesn't, that John should be at her house around 2pm Friday afternoon.  
When Friday rolled around, John showed up at Bill's house for the planned time at 2pm sharp & after paying her the agreed upon $500, they went to the bedroom & completed their sexual transaction as Sue had promised. Afterwards, John quickly dressed & left.  
As usual, Bill came home from work at 6pm & upon entering the house, asks his wife abruptly, "Did John come by the house this afternoon?"

With a lump in her throat, Bill's wife answered, "Why yes, he did stop by for a few minutes this afternoon". Her heart nearly skipped  a beat when her husband curtly asked, "And did he give you $500?". In terror, she assumed that somehow he had found out, & after mustering up her best poker face, replied, "Well, yes, in fact he did give me $500".

Bill, with a satisfied look on his face, surprised his wife by saying,"Good, I was hoping he did. John came by the office this morning &
 borrowed $500 from me. He promised me he'd stop by our house this afternoon on his way home & pay me back."

 NOW THAT'S A PLAYER! ! ! !

 I am hopeing that this note finds everyone healthy.  We have spent a rough few days together, yet for myself today beacame much more difficult.  I, unforunately, had to watch a segment on NBC with Sheila Brown, Class of '96, holding a picture of a loved one.  I've been fortunate enough to have my friends return safely home, yet Sheila is still searching for her loved one.  Please inform me if you Tara Drake's e-mail address.  Last I know she worked for MTV.
Sheila was my girlfriend for awile, and you who know me,know I don't say that very often.  She is a special women who needs to hear from her friends now.  I would appreciate everyones help.  I am thinking of all of you!!!  My thoughts and prayers are with you, your families, and your co-workers.

Joe

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

If you don't have a broadband connection this will probably take too long.
For everyone else - it's worth the wait and its clean.

http://www.investools.com/c/go/BRBN/STREET-brbndCt?s=S601



Dear Investor,

The long bear market turned bullish on September 21, 2001.
And few profited as handsomely from this turnaround as
subscribers to Steve Harmon's Broadband Investor did. For
example:

September 17, 2001: Steve Harmon tells his subscribers:
"clearly more has to be done in the area of travel security."
He issues buy signs on eight travel security stocks.

Steve Harmon Says "Buy"
Stock					9/17/01	Recent
					Price	Price	Gain
-------------------------------------------------------------
InVision Technologies (INVN)*		$8.23	$37.50*	+356%
Identix (IDNX)				$7.20	$14.59	+103%
Visionics (VSNX)			$8.25	$14.43	+75%
American Science & Engineering (ASE)	$11.36	$20.25	+78%
Magal Security Systems (MAGS)		$8.30	$12.62	+52%
Compudyne (CDCY)			$13.00	$17.50	+38%
Vicon Industries (VII)			$3.31	$4.56	+38%
ICTS International (ICTS)		$9.49	$7.02	-35%

Gain since 9/17/01:	+88%
*Investors following Steve Harmon's advice sold this stock
on 12/17/01 for a HUGE gain!


September 23, 2001: Steve Harmon highlights Checkpoint
Software (CHKP) as "the best technology stock to buy now."
Investors who followed his advice reaped a huge +68% return.

September 24, 2001: Steve Harmon recommends QQQ, the stock that
tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index, as a diversified, lower-risk play
on the recovering tech and healthcare sectors. His subscribers
now enjoy a +35% gain.

what's hot for 2002:

  -- and your investing dollars. And which will be
  money-losing victims of the tech shakeout.

How Does He Do It?

A former computer specialist and high-tech venture capitalist,
Steve Harmon knows the ins & outs of the technology business --
and he sees things that most financial advisors and investors
miss. Broadband Investor deciphers the confusion, chaos and
disruption in the complex but lucrative sectors for today's
investors.

Harmon focuses on companies with the strongest fundamentals,
like market leadership, sales and earnings growth, sector
potential, and management strength. And he steers clear of
momentum darlings that run on hot air but deflate quickly
when speculators run away.

See for yourself why Investors Chronicle calls Steve Harmon
"One of the top 10 online commentators." Why Smart Money lauds
him as "One of three rising stars in technology investing."

And start getting your share of the post-September 2001 rebound
today! Take a no-risk 30-day FREE trial to Broadband Investor.

Dear Market Participants,

Software release for December 4, 2001

The ability to simultaneously offer fixed block schedules at
biddable prices will be introduced to the NYISO market.  This
Multi-Hour Block Transaction (MHBT) functionality will allow
users to specify a minimum run-time characteristic to their
external transactions.  SCUC will account for the minimum run-
time parameter of MHBTs in determining the least production cost
evaluation for the day.  As a result, if SCUC schedules the MHBT,
it will be scheduled at the full requested MW and requested time
frame.

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
representatve or the Help Desk at 518-356-6060.

Regards,

Customer Relations

Prices in the January 27, 2002 Real-Time Market are correct.

Prices in the January 28, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

Dear Benjamin C Rogers;

Because you canceled your entry last year, you assured yourself a spot in
the NYC Marathon on November 3, 2002 without having to enter the lottery.
All you need to do is register by May 1, 2002, in order to enter the 2002
marathon.

You will be able to register online beginning January 31st. To do so, log
on to http://www.nyrrc.org/nyrrc/marathon-guarantee.html, type in your
unique entry number and password--your entry number is  8782 and your
password is 13ROG68782 --and then follow the instructions. You'll have to
verify or correct your personal information and then enter your payment
information.

If you'd prefer to register by mail, print out this message and return the
bottom portion (or copy your entry number, name, and address onto a
separate sheet of paper) along with a self-addressed, stamped,
business-sized (#10) envelope to: New York City Marathon Guaranteed
Entries, P.O. Box 1388 GPO, New York, NY 10116. We will send you a special
application to fill out and return by May 1, 2002, for guaranteed entry.

Having guaranteed entry to the New York City Marathon is an enviable
position. We hope you will take advantage of this opportunity and we look
forward to congratulating you on a successful marathon next November.

Best wishes,
Allan Steinfeld
Race Director



Dear New York City Marathon,

Please send me a guaranteed entry application for the 2002 New York City
Marathon. I have enclosed a self-addressed, stamped, business-sized (#10)
envelope.

 8782
Benjamin C Rogers
3133 BUFFALO SPEEDWAY APT 8206

It's now 4am on the 14th, and I saw Sheila Brown on NBC holding a missing person sign.  That is the only CUA person I've seen or heard of.  If anyone knows anything please let me know.  Sheila has been very special to me since the first day I met her.
My thoughts and prayers are with everyone!!

I am o.k. So is Kiernan, Dimino, Lytle, Romano. I am at work today at 
the Empire State Building. Security is tight. Only employees with 
picture ID allowed in. Must go through metal detectors and police have 
all streets around Empire State Building blocked off. F-16 fighter jets 
flying overhead to protect building and make me feel a little safer. 
Please let me know if all CUA people are O.K. I am not sure if you know 
her, but my wife's best friend Amy Callahan from CUA, I believe lost her 
boyfriend who worked at Cantor Fitzgerald on the 105th Floor of Tower 1. 
He was a really nice guy. Fitz's brother-in-law alo worked at Cantor 
Fitzgerald on the 104th floor. No Cantor Fitzgerald people have 
reported in and Dimino says no one above the plane crashes were able to 
make it out. Please say a prayer for them. 
Good luck, and let me know if you hear anything.

Dear Friends, 
I have been lucky enough to speak with a few of you today. I wish that 
it was possible to speak to all of you. I, fortunately, have not heard 
any grave news of my friends as of 2am 9/12/01. I would love to hear 
from everyone posted to this note, whom I've not spoken to as yet. I am 
thinking and praying for all of you, your families, and co-workers. 
Please know people everywhere are thinking of everyone in New York. I 
hope you all are well, and will be waiting to hear anything from anyone. 
Your Friend, 
Joe

Over the past few weeks we have held several "Breakfast Club" meetings to update members of the Program and business units leaders on the results of the recent Program Survey, to discuss several initiatives we have underway, and to provide an opportunity for Q&A.  

I want to invite any of you who may not have been able to attend one of these four meetings, to a final meeting on Tuesday, October 30.  The meeting will be held in EB 5C2, and will run from 7:30 to 8:30 am.  A continental breakfast will be provided. 

Because space in this room is limited, please rsvp to my assistant Maxine Levingston by 12:00 noon on Monday, October 29.  Maxine can be reached by email at Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com <mailto:Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com> <<mailto:Maxine.E.Levingston@ENRON.com>>.

There is an ICWG Meeting scheduled for November 1 from 9AM-3PM.  There is
also a Demand Response WG Meeting planned for November 2.  I would like to

Certifications, Event Reporting, Metering requirements and expectations,
Deficiencies and charges, derating methodology, UCAP, etc....ALL RIPs

The NYISO Back-Up Dispatch System  is scheduled to be tested on Tuesday,
January 8 ,2002.  The test will begin at about 10:30 a.m. and last for
approximately one hour.

Security Constrained Dispatch (SCD) will be stopped, but the mainframe
computer will continue to operate, allowing the NYISO to monitor security.
If a situation occurs, the Shift Supervisor will be able to re-start SCD
and take appropriate action.  The Market Information System (MIS) and
Balancing Market Evaluation (BME) will remain available during the test.

If you have any questions, please call Customer Relations at 518-356-6060.

The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 07:00 and 16:00 in the January 22,
2002 Real-Time Market.

In addition, the NYISO is reserving hours beginning 0:00 through 6:00
in the Hour-Ahead locational reserve market.

Prices in the January 23, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

Mike-
What a day! I didn't hear from Tara until 4:00 and she worked next door.
She's pretty upset. She said she saw things that she will never forget. I'm
going to pick her up in NJ today. Jean is getting married on Saturday and
most of Jamie's friends are flying in. Have you heard from everybody? Hope
everyone is ok. Talk to you soon.

Michelle

Wednesday afternoon Febuary 6th, 2002, the Enron building experienced a brief power outage.  The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.  Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building's backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.  Given heighten concerns for national security, evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously.

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.

RBowers@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

In its Order on Rehearing issued by FERC in Docket ER00-1969-002 on
November 8, 2001, the Commission directed the NYISO to re-calculate
operating reserve charges for March 2000 within 15 days.

The  NYISO  initiated  the  rebilling of March 2000 settlements through the
settlement  adjustment  process  on  the  afternoon  of  November 21, 2001.
Advisory  billing  statements  have  been posting to customer web locations
since  midnight November 22, 2001.  The NYISO anticipates completion of the
March 2000 settlement adjustment at approximately 18:00, November 23, 2001.
Posting  of  advisory billing statements will continue through the evening,
but should complete by 23:00.  Invoices are scheduled to be posted for this
settlement adjustment on, or about, December 7, 2001.

In  its  Order  on  Rehearing  issued  by  FERC  in Docket ER00-1969-002 on
November 8, 2001, the Commission rejected the NYISO's request for rehearing
to  continue  to  bill for operating reserves based on the $2.52 bid cap in
effect  for  the period March 1 through March 27, 2000.  FERC also directed
the NYISO to re-calculate operating reserve charges for that period without
the bid cap in place.

On Friday, November 16, 2001, the NYISO filed a stay/extension with FERC in
order  to postpone any re-billing pending an appeal of the FERC decision in
the  Federal Appeals Court. In the event that FERC does not act in a timely
manner   on  the  NYISO's  request,  the  upcoming  March  2000  settlement
adjustment,  expected  to  be  issued  on  or  about December 7, 2001, will
reflect  this  re-calculation in accordance with the FERC Order.  The total
amount  of  this  adjustment  is  approximately  $27 million, which will be
allocated  to the appropriate suppliers and LSE's for the period of March 1
through March 27, 2000.

Gentlemen,

We are the four most bored individuals at work that I know right now.  In
efforts to take 60 seconds of boredom out of your day.... read this slowly.
If we all pass on one 60 second read to each other, we will have 4 less
minutes to kill each day... wouldn't that be special.

A Few Zen Thoughts For Those Who Take Life Too Seriously

Save the whales. Collect the whole set

A day without sunshine is like..........night.

On the other hand...........you have different fingers.

42.7 percent of all statistics are made up on the spot.

99 percent of lawyers give the rest a bad name.

I feel like I'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe.

Honk if you love peace and quiet.

Remember, half the people you know are below average.

He who laughs last thinks slowest.

Depression is merely anger without enthusiasm.

The early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.

I drive way too fast to worry about cholesterol.

Support bacteria. They're the only culture some people have.

Monday is an awful way to spend 1/7 of your week.

A clear conscience is usually the sign of a bad memory.

Change is inevitable, except from vending machines.

Get a new car for your spouse. It'll be a great trade!

Plan to be spontaneous tomorrow.

Always try to be modest, and be proud of it!

If you think nobody cares, try missing a couple of payments.

How many of you believe in telekinesis? Raise my hand...

OK, so what's the speed of dark?

How do you tell when you're out of invisible ink?

If everything seems to be going well, you have obviously overlooked
something.

When everything is coming your way, you're in the wrong lane.

Hard work pays off in the future. Laziness pays off now.

Everyone has a photographic memory. Some just don't have film.

If Barbie is so popular, why do you have to buy her friends?

Eagles may soar, but weasels don't get sucked into jet engines.

What happens if you get scared half to death twice?

I used to have an open mind but my brains kept falling out.

I couldn't repair your brakes, so I made your horn louder.

Why do psychics have to ask you for your name?

Inside every older person is a younger person wondering what the hell
happened.

The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 17:00 and 21:00 in the January 28,
2002 Real-Time Market.

Prices in the January 29, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

Dear Market Participants

Note:  The following change was originally scheduled for October 17, 2001.

On October 31, 2001, the NYISO web servers will be upgraded.  This will
require both software and hardware changes.  While these changes will be
transparent to the users, these changes will require that the MIS system
be unavailable for approximately 60 minutes.  The outage will begin at
approximately 11:35 AM.  Market Participants planning on submitting
HAM transactions or modifying Day Ahead bids should act accordingly.

The NYISO will minimize the duration of the outage as much as possible
as we recognize the inconvenience caused by system outages.  Ultimately,
these changes will result in a more stable environment and provide enhanced
services that the current web servers are unable to perform.

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
Representative or the Help Desk at (518) 356-6060.

Thank You
Customer Relations

Ben, 
Hope you had fun in Martha's Vineyard.  Bet you are glad to have Megan back.   
I am sure CBCIII could not survive without me for more than a couple of  
days..... 
Can you send your dad and MA's and your mom and Dale's address.  They sent us  
a wonderful and very generous gift. 
Stay cool in that Houston August. 
Hope to see you soon. 
     Deirdre CARNES!

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

period May 1, 2002 through April 30, 2003.

The NYISO report "Locational Installed Capacity Requirements
Study Covering the New York Control Area for the 2002 - 2003
Capability Year" has been re-posted to the NYISO web-site.
Please use the web address provided below to find this
document.

The following revisions have been made to the 2/15/2002
posting of this report:

1)   In Table 2, the peak load, ICAP LCR and UCAP LCR for
     New York City and Long Island have been revised
     to correct typos in the peak load values that effect the
     calculation of the ICAP LCR and UCAP LCR

2)    An explanation has been provided for the large
     reduction in the Long Island locational requirements

2002 Real-Time Market.

Prices in the January 26, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

>From NYTimes.com ? A Special Investment Report From StockTopics.com*     =
=09

 =20
   [IMAGE]Aggressive Growth!   Strong Buy Recommendation! =09


  Over the last six months  investors who have followed our recommendations=
 have realized an average  return of 78% on their money.   =09


 [IMAGE]  OTC:BB Ticker:  LQDX  Rating: Strong  Buy =09 Shares Outstanding:=
  10,700,000  Float (estimate):  2,900,000  Current Price:  $2.08  12 Month=
 Target Price:  $16.80 =09


    Our current  recommendation is:  Liquidix Inc.  (OTC BB:  LQDX)       S=
mart  investors understand that companies with government and military  app=
lications are especially attractive in times of global  instability.    Our=
 current recommendation, LIQUIDIX, INC. of  Arizona (OTC BB: LQDX), has pos=
itioned itself as the leading competitor in  the high-tech industrial manuf=
acturing industry with its customizable  array of magnetic fluid vacuum sea=
ls.    NASA, Honeywell,  ADM, Intel, have already used the vacuum seals cre=
ated by Liquidix. These  products benefit such important technologies as na=
vigational gyros,  infrared detectors, heat-seeking missiles, laser sightin=
g and night-vision  equipment.  =09


    ABOUT THE  COMPANY     LIQUIDIX, INC.  recently purchased Advanced Flui=
d Systems, a company based in the United  Kingdom, strategically increasing=
 its marketshare and making Liquidix  competitive in the global market.    =
 Liquidix has  signed contracts with several Military/Government Agencies a=
nd U.S.  National Laboratories, including NASA, which have produced signifi=
cant  growth in the company.     Liquidix is one of only three  companies i=
n the world to produce magnetic fluid vacuum seals and it's the  only one t=
hat is traded publicly in the United States. Because costs in  this industr=
y are very similar between companies, Liquidix has studied and  surpassed i=
ts competition in delivery time. Liquidix can deliver the same  product to =
its destination in 1/4 the time of its nearest competitor,  making them esp=
ecially desirable for companies who must meet an increasing  demand for mag=
netic fluid vacuum seals.     Liquidix has  conservatively estimated that t=
heir gross revenues for 2002 will increase  more than 40% over 2001, and by=
 2003 will increase another 110%. Through  strategic mergers and acquisitio=
ns Liquidix also estimates that their  profit margins for 2002 will increas=
e by 60% over 2001, and by 2003 will  increase another 200%.      REASONS T=
O OWN THE  STOCK    1. Liquidix  provides magnetic fluid vacuum seals for g=
overnment and military  applications that are in higher demand due to incre=
asing military activity  in the U.S.       2. Liquidix, through  strategic =
alliances and acquisitions, has established itself as the leader  of an ind=
ustry that is projected to earn more than $4.5 billion dollars by  2002.   =
    3. Liquidix provides  products to industry giants such as NASA, HONEYWE=
LL, INTEL, and ADM,  virtually guaranteeing the growth of this strong  comp=
any.       4. Liquidix aggressive  and strategic acquisition of companies l=
ike Advanced Fluid Systems  demonstrates a strong vision for the future and=
 positions them as a world  leader in magnetic fluid technology.     5. Liq=
uidix is one of  only three companies in the world to produce magnetic flui=
d vacuum seals  and it is the only one that is traded publicly in the  U.S.=
       6. Facilities owned and  operated by Liquidix in the United States a=
nd Europe have given the  company a foothold on both sides of the Atlantic,=
 with opportunities to  break into additional international markets.  Wall =

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

If I were President George W. Bush's Speech Writer. By Mitchell R. Robb

Good evening my fellow Americans.
First, I want to pass on my condolences to the people of New York and all
Americans that are hurting in this tragic time. You can rest assured that
anything and everything that can be done to assure the safety of our country
will be done.
This is the greatest country in the world and we will get through this
trying
time.
Now is the time for all people to set aside our petty differences and
show the world that no one or nothing can destroy the fortitude of the
American people.
To the people responsible for today's tragedy, I say this: Are you fucking
kidding me? Are the turbans on your heads wrapped too tight?
Have you gone too long without a bath? Do you not know who you are fucking
with? Americans are so hungry to kill, that we shoot at each other every
day.
We will relish that opportunity for new targets for our aggression. Have you
forgotten history? What happened to the last people that started fucking
around with us? Remember the little yellow bastards over in Japan? We
slapped
them all over the Pacific and roasted about 2 million of them in their own
back yard. That's what we in America call a big ass barbecue. Ever seen
Texas
on a map? Ever wonder why it's so big? Because  we wanted it that way,
Mexico
started jacking around with the Alamo and now they cut our lawns. England?
We
sent them packing. Ask your buddy Saddam about fucking with the good 'ole
USA. The only reason he got away the first time is because it's too hard to
shoot someone when you're doubled over laughing at them. Our soldiers aren't
trained to laugh and shoot at the same time. Now he couldn't stop a pack of
cub scouts from taking over his shitty little country. Trust us, Afghanistan
will end up a giant kitty litter box. Go ahead and try to hide, Bin Laden.
There's not a hole deep enough or a mountain high enough that's going to
keep
your camel riding asses safe. We will bomb every inch of the country that
harbors him, his camps and any place that looks and even smells like he was
there. Hell, we might even drop a few bombs on people that have pissed us
off
in the past. This is America. We kick ass. This is what we do. Go ahead and
laugh now, but the Tomahawks are coming and we will smoke your sorry asses.
God bless America!

The continuing promises to reduce OOM requests by the NYISO would seem to be
nothing more than empty verbage. I am referring to the continued multitude
of OOM dispatches that are requested every day by either ConEd and the
NYISO.

Any request for generation OOM is bypassing the SCD dispatch algorithm. The
requests are so frequent that it makes one wonder if SCD is capable of
dispatching the system at all. Generation is consistently requested OOM into
any pickup hour whether in the morning or the evening, this can mean one of
two things either SCD is significantly flawed and cannot handle any system
condition in which the system is marginally stressed or that operator
intervention into the dispatch process is for price control and not for
system security.

The nebulous and overused rationale of "requested OOM for ISO or local
security" lacks detail and any rationale. An OOM request is a special
exception to the dispatch algorithm as afforded in the tariff to allow
resolution of a system condition that SCD cannot resolve. Since these
requests are requested so frequently you have to assume that SCD is
inherently flawed.

Yes the 138 KV modeling may go in service in the near future but will it
really reduce the OOM calls. ConEd has a carte blanche to load generation
whatever and whenever they want, even when it is not in their transmission
district (Roseton OOM dispatch). There is no justification required and
clearly it is in their economic interest to request generation OOM. Controls
and the capability to audit these requests are required to mitigate the load
server with 40% of the New York State load to cease and desist bypassing the
SCD dispatch algorithm.

The consistent use of the NYPA GTs, the Gilboa generators, etc. are a
consistent abuse of a loophole in the tariff that allow interference into
the system dispatch unchecked and without any published rationale. I would
only assume that if a generator abused the dispatch to the same extent they
would have been thrown in mitigation jail a long time ago.

It would appear that the plague of OOM requests that have distorted prices
in New York may soon be reduced to the point that a true market may evolve
and introduce some interest in serving load without the unhedgable risk of
"uplift charges".

The difficulty in looking ahead is to determine what the real prices will be
without the numerous OOM requests that have been made in the past. The
information that has been published in the past with regard to generation
OOM did not quantify how much generation was removed from the bid stack at
any one time. Certainly a significant number of  peak hours were affected
but it is unknown to what degree. At a guess a number of hours probably had
over 1000 MW of generation OOM, effectively removing this generation from
the bid stack but showing up as "uplift charges" on that portion of the
electricity bill.

Two pieces of information would be extremely helpful in taking a stab at
what the energy prices should have been/are without the large OOM shadow
bilateral market that presently exists.

1. How much generation in aggregate was loaded OOM for each hour in each
zone?
2. Approximately how much was the uplift assigned to each zone on a daily
basis?

On a side note it is interesting to note that there is a recent presentation
to the AMP/ICM Task Force by one of the participants that has determined
that if all the large suppliers collude in tandem to withhold 50 MW each
that there could conceivably be an increase in price. While this conspiracy
theory is of concern to said presenter it would seem highly unlikely,
especially considering that bid load or exports provide a much higher impact
on price in reality than the unlikely scenario of some large suppliers all
colluding in tandem.
What should be of concern does not seem to be on their radar screen. Why are
there so many OOM requests in NYC alone? Despite the more complex system in
NYC the number of requests is significant. The resultant distortion in price
has the result of making a market that is very difficult to predict and very
difficult to hedge. The uplift charges assigned to those trying to serve
load can be devastating, well that is those without the ability to pass it
through.
An interesting market development has resulted from the numerous OOM
requests. The numerous OOM requests have translated into unhedgeable uplift
that deters retail competition. The result of a lack of retail competition
would be that customers would continue to reside with the incumbent provider
instead of with another retail provider. While this may not be the intent of
OOM requests it is realistically the result and one that should be garnering
the attention of regulators to a higher degree than other theoretical
scenarios.

The continued practice to over regulate this market will deter generator
development. I have heard some arguments that the CAP market in NYC will
ensure investment and construction of new generation. To be clear the
argument pointed to the current cap of ~$112/kw/year and that this would
ensure that generation would be developed. ICAP payments are not a
guaranteed revenue stream to any generator, especially payments of
$9.40/kw/month. New generation will result in more competition for the
payments which will result in lower capacity prices, especially in the
longer term. There is only a fixed amount of load and reductions in ICAP
prices do not result in an increase in demand for ICAP, prices will come
down; a review of the recent ICAP auctions proves that this true. The larger
the assumption for ICAP payments in a new generator development proforma,
the increased risk that is assumed going forward, especially in light of the
high regulatory risk in this market. A 25% decline in ICAP payments would be
devastating to a proforma that relied heavily on ICAP as a revenue stream.
Certainly the recent auction clearing prices suggest that the volatility is
greater than 25% and therefore concludes that an assumption for high ICAP
revenues are not a substitute for a viable and competitive energy market.
Certainly looking at the current forward prices, the surplus of ICAP and the
mitigated volatility it will not be long before generators with low capacity
factors and high maintenance costs will be closely examining the economics
of continuing to participate in the market.

In conclusion the modeling of the 138 KV in NYC promises to reduce OOM
requests by 70%, hopefully this will be the result. Certainly a significant
increase in information for OOM requests should be posted that should
include what load pocket, how much generation is loaded OOM and any other
information that is pertinent including a mechanism to request an audit of
those OOM requests to determine their validity. If all the requests are
always valid then there should not be a problem subjecting requests to an
audit. OOM requests are a deviation from the market based software dispatch,
these exceptions to the normal dispatch should be examined as closely as
generators are scrutinized when they deviate from their scheduled
dispatches.

Dear Market Participants,

Please note that the message below was sent to provide advance notice
of expected changes to NYISO bid caps for external transactions.
These changes are pending FERC approval.

If you have any questions, please call the Customer Relations
Help Desk at 518-356-6060 or your Customer Relations Representative.

Regards,

Customer Relations

******************************************************************************************

Dear Market Participants,

In order to provide economic priority for Pre-Scheduled Day Ahead External
Transactions, the NYISO will be implementing new Bid Caps for Day-Ahead
and Hour-Ahead EXTERNAL transactions. (Pre-Scheduling of transactions is
a project the NYISO is currently working on with support from the Market
Structures Working Group.  An overview of the project can be found on the
NYISO web site under meeting materials for the Market Structures Working
Group.)

The new bid caps will become effective for Day-Ahead and Hour-Ahead bids
for the March 28, 2002 market.

For both Day-Ahead and Hour-Ahead EXTERNAL transactions, the new bid caps
will be +/- $999.70 for import Decremental Bids and for export Sink Price
Cap Bids.

Any bid input for the March 28, 2002 market and beyond must use the new bid
cap for maximum priority status.  Bids input for evaluation up to and
including the March 27, 2002 market may continue to use the $1000.00 price
cap if maximum priority is desired.

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
representative or the Help Desk at 518-356-6060.

Regards,

Customer Relations

The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 10:00, 17:00, and 23:00 in the
January 30, 2002 Real-Time Market.

Prices in the January 31, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

Jack:
I hope that you remember me.  We played golf together at The Breakers
course about three weeks ago.  I am currently working in Enron's power
trading group, but prior to this I was in Enron's corporate development
group.  I mentioned to you that my Dad is Jim Rogers, Chairman and CEO of
Cinergy Corp., which is a mid size ($5.4 Bil.)  utility located in
Cincinnati.  He has been CEO of this company for over 13 years and is
always looking for ways to grow his company through strategic acquisitions.
In the past he has talked to some of your bankers, but I would like to try
and get you two together, to see if there is something your companies can
work on together.  I really think the two of you could have a successful
meeting.  He is very  forward thinking and is quite open to new ideas and
creative structures.  His contact information is listed below.  I hope all
is going well and again, it was a pleasure to have met you and play golf
with you at your club.  Please let me know if you need any additional
information.

Dear Market Participants,

Software release for November 27, 2001

A new Consolidated Invoice will be utilized to report
NYISO billing information. The new invoice will have
the capability to present the current month's billing
and up to eight settlement adjustments, on a single
invoice. Additionally, enhanced data access for bill
reconciliation will be available.

New data postings will be made available on the web site
to provide real-time internal transmission limits and flows,
as well as transmission line scheduled and actual outages.
This posting is part of the collection of data requests made
by the Business Issues Committee (BIC) in September 2000.

The NYISO web page will be modified to add a ticker function
that displays the real-time load information (this change was
originally scheduled for October, but was delayed). A new
application, called the Moving Range Chart, will plot LBMP
prices for a specific generator or zone and will be available
on the NYISO website.


If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
representatve or the Help Desk at 518-356-6060.

Regards,

Customer Relations

During the course of their investigation, Special Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be taking documents they believe may be important for their investigation from employees' offices.  The FBI has agreed to return copies of such documents. 

In addition, should you have an immediate need for a document requested by the FBI, please make a copy of the specific document and give the original to the FBI. Thank you for your cooperation.

TDSP	:	Will be a copy from esttdsp as of Thursday, January 17 2002 at 4:00pm (the day before Netco goes live on Friday)
TDST	:	Will be a copy from tds8itst. As requested, whenever the Netco production migration is completed, this will be refreshed from tape as of prior Dec 19 2001. 
TDSD	:	Will be a copy from tds8idev. I have moved this database into a netco server.  As soon as Clement pushed the tnsnames.ora change, you will be able to connect to TDSD


Please let me know if you have question or modification.

Tantra.

YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED=20

Q. Should an investor be concerned if one or more officers of a=20
company sell shares of its stock that they own?=20

A. Although it may look like a red flag, it isn't necessarily=20
one. Many executives today receive a large part of their=20
compensation in stock options. So when they have to buy a house=20
or make a college tuition payment, they sell some shares. They=20
may also be trying to diversify their investments, not wanting=20
to have too much of their portfolio in one company.=20

On the other hand, one insider (or many insiders) selling might=20
indeed signal a loss of faith in the company. If you're worried,=20
you might want to take a closer look at the company's recent=20
performance. Perhaps fire up your computer and see what people=20
interested in the company are saying about it online, on message=20
boards.=20


Q. What does "insured by FDIC" mean, and what does it NOT=20
insure?=20

A. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) insures our=20
traditional checking, savings and money market accounts (as well=20
as CDs) held at banks and thrifts for up to $100,000. Note,=20
though, that the FDIC does not cover stocks, bonds, mutual=20
funds, life insurance policies, annuities and the like. For=20
these, check with your financial service company to see what=20
kind of insurance may be provided.=20

Learn more about the FDIC at their website. To make sure you are=20
stashing your short-term cash in the most profitable place,=20
check out our Savings Center.=20

-----------------------------------------------------------------
THIS WEEK'S LESSON=20

OPTIONS 101
Imagine you want to invest in Legume Gas Works (ticker: BEANZ).=20
You can buy shares the usual way -- or you can buy options.=20
Here's an introduction to options.=20

There are two main types: calls and puts. A call gives you the=20
right to buy a set amount of shares at a set price within a=20
certain period of time (often just a few months). For this=20
right, you pay a price premium. Puts are similar, but give you=20
the right to sell shares.=20

If Legume is selling for $50 per share and you expect it to=20
rise, you could buy "October $55" call options for it. Let's say=20
you snap up calls to buy 100 shares, for $6 each, or a total of=20
$600. If just before your options expire Legume is selling for=20
$65 per share, you can exercise your options and buy 100 shares=20
for $5,500. Then you can keep them or sell them for $6,500.=20

If you sell, you make a $1,000 profit, right? Nope. You paid=20
$600, remember? So your profit is down to $400 -- less, when you=20
account for trading commissions.=20

Options are risky. If Legume stays at $55 or falls, your $600=20
would be entirely lost. It has to top $61 per share -- $55 plus=20
$6 -- by October for you to profit.=20

Some folks like options because of the leverage they offer. They=20
point out that if you only have $1,000, you can only buy 20=20
shares of a $50 stock. Alternatively, that $1,000 could buy many=20
more options tied to hundreds of shares of stock. True enough.=20
With options, though, timing is critical. If things don't go=20
your way in a short-term time frame, your option will expire=20
worthless.=20

Most options expire unexercised and worthless. (Those most=20
likely to profit from options are the ones who "write" or sell=20
the options.) That's because options are really about buying=20

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 4  boxes per person.  

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRIDAY, 11/16/01.

Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with the move.

T.Jae, Lisa, Claudia & Lloyd

The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 05:00 and 13:00 in the January 10,
2002 Real-Time Market.

Prices in the January 11, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to automate the
ECA-B price replacements.  Current real-time prices reflect any necessary
changes due to ECA-B.

B,

Good talking to you.  I will email your dad today to get his advice.

Does he have a junior executive type that works directly for him?  In my
ideal fantasy world I would really like to work for someone like that and get
that type of exposure to corp finance/ industry......

I am probably dreaming, but didn't know if CEO's had people like that working
directly   for them.  Obviously not an assistant, but someone in a junior
execuitive role that goes with them to all the meetings and handles follow-up
etc..... I would love to be exposed to they type of knowledge.

Just a thought.

Upon audit of price reservations, the NYISO has noted an inadvertent
omission of one hour from the February 15, 2002 Real-Time Market
reservations.  The NYISO apologizes for any inconvenience this may have
caused.  The correct reservations are as follows:

The NYISO is reserving hour beginning 8:00 in the February 15, 2002
Real-Time Market.

This reservation is in addition to the previously announced reservation of
hour beginning 21:00 in the February 15, 2002 Hour-Ahead market.

Good Morning,

	The purpose of this e-mail is to inform you that a mandatory move from your current parking location is required due to the expiration of Enron's parking contract with the Metropolitan Garage as of 1/31/01.

	The Parking & Transportation Dept. is offering alternative parking in the Allen Center Garage for $99 per month. In order for us to make this a smooth transition for you, we are asking that you respond as soon as possible, so that you will have somewhere to park on Feb. 1, 2002. The Allen Center spaces will be on a first come - first serve basis. If you have any questions you can contact Parking & Transportation at x3-7060.

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."

He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."

Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?"

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Thank you.

What's Next for
Enron Federal Credit Union

Over the years, Enron Federal Credit Union has been proud to share the Enron name and support many wonderful employees and their family members around the world.  Here are some of the exciting changes slated for the Credit Union in the coming months.

New Name
We believe it is important to change our name for the sake of our members and our organization. Our new name will reflect everything that we stand for: trustworthiness, outstanding service, innovative products, value and convenience. You can expect to hear about our official new name later this month.
    
Expanded Field of Membership
Also, being a single sponsor Credit Union for Enron Corp., it has become necessary to expand our field of membership. We continue to welcome and serve current Enron employees and their families, but we will now also invite individuals and businesses that live, work or worship in Downtown Houston and the surrounding areas to become members of our Credit Union.

Additional Location
Another immediate area of focus for the Credit Union is our location. We have made plans to open an additional full-service facility that will be located in close proximity to the Enron Building in the downtown area with easy access. More information about our new location will be announced as soon as it becomes available. At this time, our current office facility will remain open and accessible for all of our members.  

We are excited about the changes that 2002 will bring and look forward to sharing the experience with each of our members.

Bryce,

	I have a couple idea's for this model and I'd like to know what you think. I would like to create one model which would have the potential to encompass a larger amount of information. I could create a similar model which would have basically the same format but allow you to select which zones you would like to view. We could even allow the selection of which region if needed. This could save us alot of time and energy by not having to make small changes which take too much time. I'm free pretty much all morning tomorrow if you would like to get together for about 30 minutes or so and discuss. 

Thanks,
Mike

Subject: A first-hand account
Date: Wed, 12 Sep 2001 19:33:07 EDT

Below is an unbelievably chilling account of one person's experience
yesterday.
I hope this finds you all safe and well.

Adrienne Greenheart, Writer
I was one who wanted a better look. I wanted to get closer. And the price I
paid was leaving my shoes in the middle of a pile of suffocating bodies.  At
the Wall St. train stop people were covered with papers.  A plane crash.
That's what everyone said.  Then a boom.  Everyone ran.  I ran to my office
on Wall and Pearl and called my brother in Illinois.
I wanted to be closer.  At the corner of Church and Broadway, I angled my
way
through a large, packed crowd to get the best view.  We talked about people
jumping.  The police stood behind the yellow tape.  Minutes later, there was
a boom.  I thought it was a bomb, so I crouched, but people ran, so I ran.
I
couldn't see anything.  I don't know how far I ran.  Couldn't see where I
was
running.  Didn't know if I was in a street or next to a building. Didn't
know
what street I was on.  No one could talk because the dust filled our
throats.
  After about ten steps I tripped over a pile of people and then people
tripped on me.
I laid there. The only sound was the falling of dust and debris.  No one
moved under me.  The weight of people on top of me got heavier.  I couldn't
breathe. I knew we were all going to die in that pile.  I pulled myself out
of the pile.  My slip-ons slipped off.  I stood up and saw nothing.  Not
even
and inch in front of me.  I put my hands out and felt for something.  I
bumped into the brick side of a building.  I bumped into milk crates.  I
stopped. I had no idea what to do, and I knew everyone around me was
suffocating.  I thought about my Mom and dad, they would be so sad to hear
that I died.  I thought about my husband. Just married and I will not get to
live my life with him.  I thought about my brothers.  They would cry.  I
told
myself to just keep trying to find away to air, but I didn't believe I would
live.
I bumped into something that I could feel the top of, so I lifted myself up.
I worried I was going into the back of a dump truck, and I was scared I'd be
trapped.  I didn't know if there was fire, or a bomb.  I didn't know how to
protect myself ??" find air.  Go up? ??" so I didn't know for sure that a
dump
truck would be bad.  I think it was scaffolding.  I think I jumped over
piles
of bodies by climbing scaffolding.
I pulled myself into a building. What building? I don't know.  And I took a
breath.  I took two breaths.  I was sure the building would be bombed.  I
looked for stairs.  I kept thinking I needed clean air.  I found a bathroom.
I didn't realize I wanted water until it was there.  Four men inside. Two
fighting   faucet.  I shared the toilet with another man.  We drank almost
the whole bowl.
Once the four of us were calmed by water and air, we ventured outside the
bathroom.  We walked up stairs. S lowly.  We checked doors behind us, left
them all open.  We got up only one floor.  We waited.  I cried.  They shared
one can of apple juice.
The intercom in the building announced stay where you are.  I was so
relieved
to know people knew we were there.  The intercom announced again and I
thought another bomb would go off and I'd die.  I cried.  The guy with the
apple juice put his arm around me.  I wondered why no one else cried.  The
intercom announced to go down the stairs.  I picked up a wastebasket: I
planned to fill it with water.  Planned to use it to shelter myself from the
next bomb.  (I still had no idea the building collapsed.)
In the lobby of the building someone gave me a Nantucket Nectar and told me
to vomit.  I walked outside the building with the drink in my wastebasket.
There was no one around. White everywhere.  The four of us had nowhere to
go.
  I couldn't remember where I was.  I walked toward the water.  Police
directed very one north.  I asked a woman next to me, "Where are we going?"
She said, "I don't know."  She had no dust.  She looked so steady.  I
followed her.  This was the beginning of her long protection.
She said, "You can walk home with me.  You need a shower."  I coughed.  She
asked why I was carrying a wastebasket.  I said, "In case there's another
bomb."  She held on to my arm as we made our way next to the river.  In
Chinatown, she bought me shoes.  At the Bowery we finally found a pay phone
that didn't have a line of people.  So she called her husband and I sat down
next to my wastebasket.  It was the first time I sat down, and I started
crying.
We resumed walking.  Sometimes we ran.  I made sure to keep up and I didn't
tell Teresa that I was worried that I would faint.  I drank Nantucket Nectar
every time I got dizzy.
At 59th St. a plane went overhead and I screamed.  In front of
Bloomingdales.
  There was no one there from Wall St. I knew I looked crazy.  I screamed
anyway.  I reminded everyone there were no planes allowed to fly.  Someone
said, "It's the army."  I came out from under my wastebasket and kept
walking.  Theresa's apartment was 71st on the Upper West Side. Where
everyone
looked fine.
In the shower, dripping debris down my body, I remembered one more moment
under the rubble.  When I couldn't breathe. When I couldn't see.  In the
middle of the dead quiet was a voice.  He said, "Is there anyone here? Can
someone hold my hand?" I reached out to the voice, and held his hand.  It
was
shaking and the skin was old.  I squeezed and then I let go.

Ben,
 
Thanks for passing my resume to the guys at Cinergy.  I had the interview last Friday and I believe it went pretty well.  I liked what they had to say and their view on the growth of the trading operations.  
 
Hope all is well.
 
Jaime

Dear Market Participants,

NERC announced a delay in the implementation of E-Tag Version 1.7 from
March 6, 2002 to April 10, 2002.  This delay is necessitated by vendor
inter-operability problems experienced during dress rehearsals on
February 14 and February 21.  These problems could adversely impact
reliability and hamper the marketplace.

The NYISO will implement E-Tag Version 1.7 in tandem with NERC.  NYISO
Market Participants should ensure that their respective Agent Services
are upgraded to the new version, should complete their TSIN registration,
and are encouraged to participate in the remaining dress rehearsals to the
extent possible.

NERC is conducting a survey of the preparedness of Industry Participants
for the planned implementation of E-Tag Version 1.7.  Market Participants
are also asked to complete this survey.  The responses to the survey
received thus fare are posted on the NERC website.

Attached below are additional details and instructions for the
implementation of E-Tag Version 1.7.  If you have questions about
New York- or Northeast-specific issues, please call the Customer
Relations Help Desk at 518-356-6060 or email Karl Tammar at
ktammar@nyiso.com.  Vendor-specific issues should be reported directly
to E-Tag vendors.  NERC has requested that general problems be reported
to TISFORUM.

Regards,

Customer Relations
518-356-6060

Dear Market Participants,

The NYISO encountered problems with SCD last night as a result of the code
changes to transfer the Rockland Electric load to PJM.  The NYISO entered
Back-up Dispatch System mode around 4:30 a.m.and remained there until about
8:00 a.m.  We are currently using SCD for dispatch, and the transfer of the
Rockland Electric load has been completed.

Market Monitioring will place additional monitoring focus on the HAM to
ensure competitive market results in the event that problems with SCD
re-occur.

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
Representative or the Customer Relations Help Desk at 518-356-6060.

Regards,

Customer Relations

The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 20:00 and 23:00 in the January 17,
2002 Real-Time Market.

In addition, the NYISO is reserving hour beginning 23:00 in the January 17,
2002 Hour-Ahead locational reserve market.

Prices in the January 18, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and are currently in an Enron contract garage you are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The  Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until fall 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until  Sky Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a an information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.

Dear Ben,
We had a meeting at your offices last December where I expressed my interest in pursuing a rotation in your division. As you may remember, you set me a meeting with Jeff Donahue that same evening. I understood back then that it was a bit early in the process.

In August I will be joining the firm as an Associate and now that the management at your division might have a more clear idea of your needs, I would like to reaffirm my interest in pursuing a rotation at your department. I am confident that the skills that I have built in the past constitute a good basis for dealing with the demands of the group in the present.

I would also very much appreciate if you could give me any suggestions in order to maximize my chances.
I would fly to Houston in order to meet with and whomever you think appropriate at your request.
I am attaching my updated resume. Please pass it around.

I will give you a call in a couple of days.

Best regards,

Teseo Bergoglio

B,

In San Diego right now with the US Navy. Heading into the field with Marines
M-Thu this week, so will be incommunicado.

Wanted to check and see if your dad got the email I sent him about 1 days
ago....wasn't expecting an immediate response as I know he is very busy, just
wanted to make sure he got it.

What's the latest with you and your plan?

     --CBCIII

The NYISO Back-Up Dispatch System  is scheduled to be tested on Tuesday,
March 5,2002_.  The test will begin at about 10:30 a.m. and last for
approximately one hour.

Security Constrained Dispatch (SCD) will be stopped, but the mainframe
computer will continue to operate, allowing the NYISO to monitor security.
If a situation occurs, the Shift Supervisor will be able to re-start SCD
and take appropriate action.  The Market Information System (MIS) and
Balancing Market Evaluation (BME) will remain available during the test.

If you have any questions, please call Customer Relations at 518-356-6060.

Dear Market Participants,

The following changes to the NYISO OASIS/MIS/CSS systems will be released
on February 26, 2002.

Preliminary changes to the MIS database will be made in preparation for
future testing and implementation of the Open Scheduling System (OSS).
These changes will have no functional effect on the current system.

Minor enhancements will be made to the Consolidated Invoice.  The date
selection box will be modified to a drop down format and negative values
on the PDF output will be represented with parenthesis instead of a minus
sign.

Bidding and Scheduling pages will be updated in style to match the look and
feel of the public web site.

The process for posting prices will be updated to make it more efficient.
This will have no effect on how prices are calculated or presented.

Changes will also be made to the real-time system in preparation for the
move of the Rockland Electric load to the PJM control area.
If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
representative or the Help Desk at 518-356-6060.

Regards,

Customer Relations

RBowers@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

The bill for 10/28/2001 may be put on hold due to problems encountered with
Performance Tracking System data.  The problem is associated with the time
change from DST to EST.  An update on the status of NYISO's efforts to
address this problem will be posted mid-afternoon tomorrow.

On a side note it is interesting to note that there is a recent
presentation
to the AMP/ICM Task Force by one of the participants that has determined
that if all the large suppliers collude in tandem to withhold 50 MW each
that there could conceivably be an increase in price. While this
conspiracy
theory is of concern to said presenter it would seem highly unlikely,
especially considering that bid load or exports provide a much higher
impact
on price in reality than the unlikely scenario of some large suppliers all
colluding in tandem.


My comment:

This is a serious mischaracterization of what was said.   No collusion is
required.  All that is needed for a large impact on prices from the
exercise of market power is for the generators to act in their own self
interest.

Hey Ben-

Hope you had a great holiday and you guys are staying busy.  Things down in EIM are looking a little more promising since our current direction is to hold onto some of our assets and potentially take a group of people forward to do some low-credit trading....I'm cautiously optimistic.

I did want your recommendation on any books for someone interested in learning about power trading.  Any ideas?

Thanks Ben-

Erik

[IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  November 26, 2001     New Power Plant Planned fo=
r New York City  By Will McNamara Director, Electric Industry Analysis   [N=
ews item from Energy Info Source] New York state's siting board approved As=
toria Energy's plans to build a 1,000-megawatt power plant in New York City=
, clearing the way for construction to begin as early as January. Astoria E=
nergy hopes to have the natural-gas-fired, combined-cycle plant that will b=
e at an existing oil terminal in the Astoria section of Queens in service b=
y 2004. The company must do a certain amount of demolition and site prepara=
tion before it can begin construction, and still must receive some local pe=
rmits from New York City. Astoria Energy is a unit of SCS Energy LLC, a pri=
vately owned energy development company based in Concord, Mass.    Analysis=
: The announcement of a new power plant scheduled for the New York City are=
a should be evaluated within the context of severe power supply problems th=
at have been identified within this region. Like California, New York also =
suffers from a supply / demand imbalance. However, even if or when power su=
pply can be increased in New York, the core load center of New York City st=
ill suffers from inherent transmission deficiencies that continue to take t=
heir own toll on the stability of the market. In other words, transmission =
capacity in the region has been determined to be deficient to the extent th=
at power outside of the city cannot be reliably imported. The fact that Ast=
oria Energy has received approval from New York state's siting board to pro=
ceed with this New York City-based plant is significant, but it should not =
be forgotten that the company also must receive local permits from city gov=
ernment. This could be easier said than done, as other planned power plants=
 in the area have been blocked or significantly altered over the last year =
by community groups in New York City and surrounding boroughs who ardently =
voice concerns about environmental and other ramifications of new plant con=
struction.   The problems within the New York power market have been well d=
ocumented. The state of New York reportedly has not brought a new plant onl=
ine since 1996, when a 200-MW plant opened in Brooklyn. It has been almost =
seven years since a 1,000-MW unit in Oswego, N.Y., marked the last plant to=
 open upstate. Further, New York expects only a 3.5-percent increase in new=
 capacity in the next three to four years. Consequently, concerns about the=
 state's ability to meet increasing demand for power have gained momentum. =
Pressure has been placed on New York regulators to expedite the approval st=
eps for siting new plants in the state. However, at the same time, environm=
ental and community groups closely guard the proposals for new plants and o=
ften lobby for limitations on how and where the new plant will produce powe=
r.    While the entire state of New York is subject to shortages, the probl=
em appears to be particularly acute in New York City. A November 2000 repor=
t issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) entitled "Inves=
tigation of Bulk Power Markets, Northeast Region," highlighted specific cap=
acity problems in the New York City/Long Island community of 11 million peo=
ple. These areas are particularly vulnerable because they are isolated from=
 most of the state's grid, the study said. Like Northern California, which =
suffered rolling blackouts due to transmission constraints, New York City a=
nd Long Island can only import limited quantities of power on constrained t=
ransmission lines. Hydro and fossil resources are plentiful in upstate New =
York, but cannot reach the city. Being both densely populated and heavily r=
esidential, it is difficult to site new power plants in the area. Consequen=
tly, 80 percent of the power that the city consumes is generated by the cit=
y. New plants such as the one by Astoria Energy are being proposed because =
New York City reportedly will be short of its generating capacity needs at =
times during the course of 2002. The projected shortfall is expected to inc=
rease by another 200 MW by summer 2002.    Increased demand is causing addi=
tional problems for the energy markets of New York City and New York State.=
 Demand in the state rose by 2,700 MW from 1995 to 2000, or 2.5 times as fa=
st as new generation capacity was added. Demand over the course of 2001 was=
 expected to reach 31,100 MW, or about 3.7 percent above regulators' earlie=
r forecasts.    It is within this market context that Astoria Energy will p=
roceed with its plans for the new power plant in New York City. Astoria Ene=
rgy is a private company seeking to generate electric power with energy-eff=
icient and environmentally sound technologies in the New York City area. Th=
e company is a subsidiary of SCS Energy, a privately owned energy developme=
nt company formed in 1998 for the purpose of developing and owning new elec=
tric generating facilities. Information obtained from Astoria Energy sheds =
some additional light on the proposed plant. As noted, the 1,000-MW unit wi=
ll be a natural gas-fired facility, which will obtain natural gas supplied =
from the ConEd/New York facility pipeline. The capital cost for the plant r=
eportedly will be $600 million. Commercial operation, pending the necessary=
 approvals on the local level, is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2003.=
 Astoria Energy is seemingly confident of its chances to gain approval for =
the new plant because it will be using a technology that is specifically ge=
ared toward the reduction of air emissions.    However, despite this optimi=
sm, the community opposition factor should not be discounted, and there are=
 several examples that may foreshadow the opposition that Astoria Energy co=
uld face. Take Sithe Energies, for example, which hit a roadblock with its =
construction plans in the New York area earlier this year. Sithe Energies o=
riginally planned a 827-MW combined-cycle facility fueled by natural gas in=
 Ramapo, N.Y. Chief among the concerns of local residents is that the Ramap=
o plant was originally planned to run all the time to meet demand, and as a=
 result would use local water resources for cooling purposes. Community res=
istance thus became an issue for the company, which altered its plans and b=
egan to consider a 510-MW peaking unit (also powered by natural gas) that w=
ould only be operated in times of increased demand.     As another example,=
 environmental and community groups won a victory in court just last week t=
hat essentially will block construction of small power plants in the South =
Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island areas. Each is a 44-MW plant, thou=
gh at some sites there are twin generators operating at less than 80 MW.  A=
 coalition of the groups had opposed the construction of various plants in =
these areas and sued the New York Power Authority, claiming (among other th=
ings) that the state had failed to perform adequate environmental-review st=
udies. The groups claim that the state should test the plants for their out=
put of fine particulate matter. A lower court had ruled in favor of the sta=
te, but a judgment last week in the New York Court of Appeals was clearly a=
 win for the environmental and community groups. The new ruling, which repo=
rtedly cannot be appealed further, says that the state must do unprecedente=
d air tests at the 10 plants or shut them down by Jan. 31.     In a report =
issued earlier this year, New York State Electric & Gas Corp. (NYSEG), one =
of New York's seven utilities, said the state will not have enough megawatt=
s to support a truly competitive wholesale electric market until 2008. NYSE=
G, in a report issued late Wednesday, warned there are "serious problems wi=
th (New York's) generation supply and a lack of transmission and pipeline i=
nfrastructure." According to data included in a separate report by the New =
York ISO, which manages the state's transmission grid, between 1995 and 200=
0, while statewide demand in New York rose by 2,700 MW, generating capacity=
 under contract in the state reportedly increased only by 1,060 MW.    Cons=
equently, given all of these factors, power supplies in New York remained s=
trained and the area certainly could benefit from the construction of new g=
eneration capacity. However, Astoria Energy, which seeks to bring new gener=
ation online in New York that will be based on clean technologies, may stil=
l face an uphill battle from various groups that seemingly oppose the const=
ruction of any new plants in the region (with the exception of peaker units=
, whose output would be closely regimented). If plans for this plant are bl=
ocked or significantly altered, following the experience of Sithe Energies,=
 the options to resolve New York City's supply / demand imbalance will once=
 again become focused on a combination of other approaches, including conse=

Many of you have inquired about January reimbursements to 2002 flexible spending accounts.  Aon Consulting, Enron's flexible spending account administrator, has experienced some processing delays.  Aon has encountered difficulty in retrieving spending account deduction information, and some deductions are not appearing in Aon's records.  Enron Benefits is working with our IT group to help Aon resolve this issue.  Also, unprecedented activity at the end of 2001 flooded Aon with year-end claims.  Aon has assured us that 2001 reimbursements are now up-to-date, and that they began processing 2002 reimbursements on Monday, February 4.

Questions regarding flexible spending accounts can be directed to georgia.fogo@enron.com.

We know how interested all of you are in the Retention & Severance Plan, so we want to update you on its status.
 
As many of you know, we have been working with members of the Creditors' Committee and their consultants since December to formulate a Retention & Severance Plan, and we formally presented the plan to the committee on Friday, February 22.  We had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month.
 
We know that many of you have career options outside of Enron and that the Retention & Severance Plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave.  We sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed.  We're learning that, in bankruptcy, most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed.
 
The committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan, but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns.  The Creditors' Committee fully supports the implementation of a Retention & Severance Plan.  Such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy.  These plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate.
 
The Creditors' Committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process.  To that end, we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee.  We intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible.  This is currently our top priority, bar none!
 
When we filed for bankruptcy, we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be.  Unfortunately, that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place.
 
We now know that it takes significant time, resources and effort to understand, identify and gather the massive volume of required details, to formulate that information into a reasonable program, and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation.  The process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which Enron has been involved.  That serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse.
 
We remain committed to working with the Creditors' Committee until we can reach agreement on a plan.  We anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so, and have targeted the week of March 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court.  We will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court.
 
With respect to non-debtor companies, or those companies not in bankruptcy, new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future.
 
In the meantime, we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week.
 
And of course, we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible.

Subject:	Electric Utilities:  Weekly Report

KEY POINTS
*	We continue to recommend an overweighting in the electric utility group.  The group's attractive relative P/E
valuation, its high relative yield, its defensive nature and interest sensitivity are all reasons why we think electric
stocks should perform well versus the overall stock market for the rest of 2001.
*	The average P/E ratio for the electric utility group is now 10.8x estimated 2002 EPS, compared with a 2002 P/E
of 24.2x for the S&P 500.  The relative P/E ratio of 0.45x is below the 25-year historic normal range of 0.60x-0.80x,
and is also near the all-time low of 0.40x.
*	The average yield for the electric utility group is now 4.96%, which should make the group attractive to
individual investors earning around 2.25% in the typical money market fund.  Historically, the yield on utility stocks
has rarely been more than twice as high as money market fund yields like it is today.
*	Falling oil and natural gas prices have caused wholesale power prices, that were already very low, to fall even
further.  Electricity futures prices, shown in Exhibit 2 on Page 5, fell by another 5% in most regions in the past week.
Electricity futures prices have fallen by about 10% across the U.S. in the past month.
*	Coal prices have not come down in line with the big declines in the prices of oil, natural gas and wholesale
power (see Page 8 for data on spot coal prices).  The spot price of coal is more than 50% above the price levels from
late last year in all coal markets.  It appears that due to supply constraints, coal prices have not followed the
decline in oil and natural gas prices.
*	Electric utility stocks lagged the overall stock market last week.  For the five trading days last week,
electric utility stocks went down in value by 3.7%, compared with a gain of 1.6% for the S&P 500.  IPP stocks had a good
week, with an average gain of 7.1%.
*	SPECIAL HOLIDAY TRIVIA QUIZ.  This Thursday, Americans celebrate the Thanksgiving Day holiday.  Can you name two
nuclear power plants whose names remind you of Thanksgiving?  (The answer is on the bottom of Page 4.)

Subject: ISI Economy, Money and Markets
Importance: High



Dear Equity,

Good morning, 

I hope you had a god weekend.  I was finally able to catch up on all the
gimmicks being thrown around to jump-start the economy.  Have you seen the
one that would temporarily suspend sales taxes, a la 0.0% financing on
autos?  What the politico's should really do is get some ideas from the
organizers of the Victoria's Secret (no, there's no relation unfortunately)
TV show or the Britney Spear's HBO show.  Have you seen the ratings on
those!?  That seems to be what is drawing the American consumer these days. 

But despite that being still up in the air, it looks like the economy is in
the process of bottoming anyway.  Stocks have continued to rally, oil is
below $18, commodities have rallied, money is up and so is refi.  If we
could only get the surveys to behave, we'd be very happy.  Interest rates
had been falling up until last week when the backed up.  This was largely
interpreted as the bond market smelling the economic recovery.  If rates
get too high, it could obviously be a problem, but this "hiccup" in rates
is something we have seen before in periods of transition.  Page 3
highlights the "hiccups" in the past when you had the economy shifted from
a recession to a recovery.  

Another big question on everyone's mind is Holiday Sales.  They are widely
expected to be weak, weak, weak.  So where does that leave room for a
surprise? on the upside.  Turn to page 6 for all the positives that could
help Holiday Sales.  I for one am not expecting a lump of coal.  

The political report highlights the effects of the war in Afghanistan on
globalization.  Despite all the initial doom-and-gloom, it looks like it
has actually pushed global cooperation along.  

Jim Moltz thinks the market is just about fairly valued here at about 22
times 2002 earnings.  That being said, he also thinks the liquidity
available out there will drive the market higher when those assets start to
actively look for higher yielding instruments.  Some of that could be into
the long end of the curve if rates stay higher, but some will also be into
the equity markets.  Jim also tweaked his operating earnings estimate for
2001 from $38 to $39.50.  2002 is still at $50.  

Have a great week and a very happy Thanksgiving.  If there is anything I
can do, I will be in so please just let me know.

The NYISO is reserving hour beginning 12:00 in the January 18, 2002
Real-Time Market.

In addition, the NYISO is reserving hours beginning 19:00 through 23:00 in
the January 18,
2002 Hour-Ahead locational reserve market.

Prices in the January 19, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 08:00, 10:00, 17:00, 18:00, and
20:00 in the January 21, 2002 Real-Time Market as well as hour beginning
08:00 at all external locations.

In addition, the NYISO is reserving hours beginning 19:00, 20:00, and 23:00
in the Hour-Ahead locational reserve market.

Prices in the January 22, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

It all comes down to the rotten deal culture this place became.  I-banks have this kind of deal culture, but they seem to have the right controls in place, plus they are a lot bigger and the SEC is a clear watchdog in their dealings.

Ben, I've got a pulled muscle (groin) that I've been trying to nurse for a
few months.  Went for a run this weekend and strained it.  I wonder if we
could either postpone tennis for a week or so?  If you prefer - I could -
but will have to take it fairly easy.  Let me know.  Dave.

An audit of the price verification and correction process has revealed some
instances of problems related to coordinating the ECA-A and B end-state
process with the price reservation and correction procedures carried out by
the NYISO's consultant.  The affected days were 1, 2, 4, 9, 10, 21, 29, and
31 January 2002 and 1, 7, and 8 February 2002.  There were two problems of
coordination, each distinct but related to the other.  In certain hours on
days requiring internal price corrections, tables containing the ECA-A
adjustments at the external proxy buses were inadvertently joined to the
real-time tables, overwriting some real-time information with the BME
information.  The overwrite took place prior to the posting of the
corrected prices on the web.  The consequence was that a database that was
supposed to contain only real-time information contained a mix of real-time
and BME information.  The second problem resulted from the NYISO
consistently using an "hour-beginning" timeframe for the ECA-A and B
end-state and other processes, while the correction process that overwrote
the information (see above) used an "hour-ending" timeframe.  The
consequence was that certain top-of-the-hour intervals were corrected
inappropriately and not subsequently overwritten by the NYISO-originated
end-state ECA correction.  The NYISO apologizes for any confusion that
these correction adjustments have caused.

If I were President George W. Bush's Speech Writer. By Mitchell R. Robb

Good evening my fellow Americans.
First, I want to pass on my condolences to the people of New York and all
Americans that are hurting in this tragic time. You can rest assured that
anything and everything that can be done to assure the safety of our country
will be done.
This is the greatest country in the world and we will get through this
trying
time.
Now is the time for all people to set aside our petty differences and
show the world that no one or nothing can destroy the fortitude of the
American people.
To the people responsible for today's tragedy, I say this: Are you fucking
kidding me? Are the turbans on your heads wrapped too tight?
Have you gone too long without a bath? Do you not know who you are fucking
with? Americans are so hungry to kill, that we shoot at each other every
day.
We will relish that opportunity for new targets for our aggression. Have you
forgotten history? What happened to the last people that started fucking
around with us? Remember the little yellow bastards over in Japan? We
slapped
them all over the Pacific and roasted about 2 million of them in their own
back yard. That's what we in America call a big ass barbecue. Ever seen
Texas
on a map? Ever wonder why it's so big? Because  we wanted it that way,
Mexico
started jacking around with the Alamo and now they cut our lawns. England?
We
sent them packing. Ask your buddy Saddam about fucking with the good 'ole
USA. The only reason he got away the first time is because it's too hard to
shoot someone when you're doubled over laughing at them. Our soldiers aren't
trained to laugh and shoot at the same time. Now he couldn't stop a pack of
cub scouts from taking over his shitty little country. Trust us, Afghanistan
will end up a giant kitty litter box. Go ahead and try to hide, Bin Laden.
There's not a hole deep enough or a mountain high enough that's going to
keep
your camel riding asses safe. We will bomb every inch of the country that
harbors him, his camps and any place that looks and even smells like he was
there. Hell, we might even drop a few bombs on people that have pissed us
off
in the past. This is America. We kick ass. This is what we do. Go ahead and
laugh now, but the Tomahawks are coming and we will smoke your sorry asses.
God bless America!

The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 9:00 and 12:00 in the January 16,
2002 Real-Time Market.

In addition, the NYISO is reserving hour beginning 23:00 in the January 16,
2002 Hour-Ahead locational reserve market.

Prices in the January 17, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

=20

=20

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=
ies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will b=
e incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als=
o be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations=
, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) =
507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Bu=
ilding, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (=
713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be consi=
dered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders i=
n connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their d=
irect or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are availab=
le in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

-- This week TWST has an interview with the President and CEO of Xchange, Inc.
He states, "Xchange is a business that started in 1995, a private company,
a profitable business that worked its way to a public offering in 1998. And
through that period of time it assembled a pretty marquis base of customers.
The company has over 300 customers, names you may know such as Ford Motor
Company; J.P. Morgan Chase; actually, 10 of the top US banks; retail companies
like Staples; consumer package companies; big investment houses like Fidelity."
He continues, "At Xchange we focus on the largest customers in the Global 2000.
We believe that our history and our customer base there gives us an opportunity
to continue to build a product that's going to perform and scale for a company
the size of Ford. As an example, Ford, last year, did with us over 100 different
marketing campaigns: they want to double that this year. And their biggest worry
is performance, scalability, being able to take the same amount of people and
being able to double the companies and our technology is really the way they do
that. So, competitively, we've done very well at big customers. That's our
focus."  To read more of this interview

-- This week TWST also has an interview with the President and Chief Executive Officer
of Prophet 21, Inc.He states, "Prophet 21 develops enterprise software
solutions, including an Internet trading network, and offers supporting
professional services for durable goods distributors that enable them to
increase sales and improve customer service while reducing operating costs.
Ever since our founding by John and Dorothy Meggitt in 1967, Prophet 21 has
positioned itself as a leader in serving the technology needs of durable goods
distributors in North America. We currently have nearly 2,000 customers - each
with an average of five stocking locations - that utilize Prophet 21's
technology and technology services. Our core target markets include industrial,
fastener, electrical, and plumbing distributors."  He continues, "Prophet 21 has
a very successful history of bringing enterprise software solutions and the
associated professional services to distributors and that will continue well into
the future. In addition, we recently expanded our offerings to include an Internet
trading network, Trading Partner Connect. Trading Partner Connect streamlines the
commerce process between distributors, their manufacturers/suppliers, and
customers, thereby increasing sales and improving customer service while reducing
operating costs."  To read more of this interview

Actually I have raised issues related to the PARs several times. There is
currently an item on the MSWG agenda concerning them though not concerning
control (ISO vs ConEd) but rather modeling and pricing.

Joe has brought up some great  points once again. As Tom has pointed out
that
the NYISO should be in the forefront in addressing this. Since 1999 the PAR
issue has been brought up time and time again, both in committees and in
direct
complaints to the NYISO. The ball is squarely in the NYISO's court. I,
would
like to see on this forum, an update/discussion from the NYISO addressing
Joe's
concerns. If nothing else it would bring everyone up to date on where we
are on
this issue. All too often good points are brought up on this forum, just to
die
because there was no NYISO imput or the answer was off line.

FROM:  Enron Property & Services Corp

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.  

For employees who park in the Allen Center, Met, or Enron Center garage, new parking rates are in effect beginning with the January 31st paycheck.  Rates for 2002 have increased by $5 for unreserved and $10 for reserved spaces.  This increase is consistent with first of the year rate increase obligations in Enron's parking lease agreements with the garage operators.  Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.  

Direct parking costs to employees are as follows:
Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 3rd & 5th Floors	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	
Allen Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 3rd Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	


Please note that effective January 31st only the Enron Center and Allen Center Garages will be available for Enron employee parking.  To request parking or to switch to these garages please call Parking and Transportation at ext. 37060 or ext. 36399.

If you have any questions about Bus Passes or Parking, please call Martin Katz at ext. 59322.

"It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right. I hope
you had the time of your life." -- Green Day

-----------------------------------------------------------------
TOP STORY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

HARD TIMES AT MICROSOFT?
Is Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) ready to fly again? Backing out a
$1.2 billion hit in its investment portfolio, the software titan
reported profits of $0.43 a share. That was three cents better
than analysts were expecting as sales grew by 6% to $6.1 billion.

>>FULL STORY: http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=522447

-----------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Pass the sun block. Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) is reporting
a nickel a share loss for its fiscal first-quarter on a steep
decline in revenue. The top-line sank to $2.9 billion from a
$5.1 billion showing a year ago. Sun's set came as no surprise
since the network computing specialist had warned investors
earlier this month. The California company expects to return to
profitability by the June quarter.

Holy Beanie Babies, eBay (Nasdaq: EBAY) is still hot. The online
auctioneer trounced expectations and bid up its fourth-quarter
prospects. Quarterly earnings came in at $0.12 a share on a 71%
surge in sales to $194.4 million. It's also raising the ante for
the current period. While the company was originally expecting
December-quarter revenue to come in between $195 million and
$205 million, it is now hiking up both ends of the range by an
extra $5 million. The strong showing and bar raising is an
impressive feat as the company is a month into its 100-day
Auction for America in which it is waiving its fees for
charitable listings.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=522448

There's no business like e-business for PeopleSoft (Nasdaq:
PSFT) as the enterprise software maker reported earnings from
recurring operations of $0.15 a share, three cents ahead of Wall
Street's projection. Thanks to a growth in license revenue for
its flagship PeopleSoft 8 -- an excellent name for a B-movie if
there ever was one -- sales topped the half-billion dollar mark.

No one is putting struggling cow-patched computer maker Gateway
(NYSE: GTW) out to pasture just yet. While the company's
third-quarter loss was in line with already lowered
expectations, Gateway sees shipments picking back up in the
current quarter. Excluding charges, the company lost $0.17 a
share on revenue of $1.4 billion. The company managed to grow
its domestic market share in the consumer and education segments
and is expecting to report a quarterly profit to close out the
year.

Last doughnuts with the Fool
Finally, it's true. Come next week you will have to enjoy your
Krispy Kreme (NYSE: KKD) glazed doughnut and your Starbucks
(Nasdaq: SBUX) double latte without the company of your
Breakfast With the Fool. It was September 21, 1998, when Yi-Hsin
Chang and Brian Bauer rolled out our first morning plateful. The
Nasdaq Composite stood at 1663.77 back then. It's at 1652.72
this morning. Not a lot has changed. Everything has changed. As
we refocus our efforts towards enhancing many of our existing
features and rolling out new ones, we want to thank you for
being part of our community and appreciate your patience as we
evolve in order to serve you. Hey. You still have some of that
doughnut glaze on your chin. So, onward and forward. Like
Wendy's (NYSE: WEN), we just don't do breakfast anymore.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=522449

-----------------------------------------------------------------
POST OF THE DAY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

APPLE Q4 - THE GOOD WITH THE BAD
"Now, we have Apple rather coyly dangling the idea of a brand
new non-Mac device to wow the audience. At the same time,
revenue projections are extremely conservative, at $1.4B for
Christmas. Given the continuous stream of revenue
over-estimation coming from Apple over the last 12 months, we
have to assume that even Apple doesn't expect its special
surprise to help Q4's results."

Attached please find a Word document for the November 28 BAWG meeting
agenda.

Also attached, please find an Excel file with very rough first draft of a
list of BAWG issues.  This file will be discussed under agenda item #4.
The goal will be to solicit comments from the BAWG members and NYISO Grid
Accounting staff at the November 28 meeting to correct all the rows and
columns of this spreadsheet.   Eventually, this will be the official,
disclosed list of BAWG issues posted on the NYISO web site per approved
NYSEG motion from the November 2001 BIC meeting.

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants,

The following software updates will become active on October 30, 2001.

The NYISO web infrastructure will be enhanced through the
implementation of BEA's WebLogic product. The new application
server will be the platform utilized by the MIS to provide
bidding and scheduling capability to Internet customers. The
new software replaces the NetDynamics product, will provide
the same functionality, and will be a more robust and reliable
development platform for future enhancements.

Enhancements will be made to the software that generates the
Pre-MGF (Master Generator File) file used by transmission owners
in the event of a Backup Dispatch System (BDS) activation. The
enhancements will ensure more accurate operation of the BDS system.

The NYISO web page will be modified to add a ticker function
that displays the real-time load information.

Multiple preliminary software changes will be made to the MIS,
SPIDER, and BAS systems in preparation for the activation of
Virtual Bidding in the NYISO energy markets on November 1, 2001.
Activation of Virtual Bidding is pending approval by the FERC.


If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
representatve or the Help Desk at 518-356-6060.

Regards,

Customer  Relations

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

Ben,

Change of plans.  Joe would also like you to meet with Tim McCabe,
however Tim is out until 12/4 and there is a possibility that Ken King
will not be back in until 12/4.  Would you be available on 12/4?

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ."  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."

The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 17:00 and 18:00 in the January 29,
2002 Real-Time Market.

In addition, the NYISO is reserving hours beginning 15:00 and 19:00 in the
January 29, 2002 Hour-Ahead locational reserve market.

Prices in the January 30, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

There is a book store called the Brown Book Store located several blocks from here.  They have several books on trading within this industry that you will want to read.  You will need to call information to find out where they are.  Good Luck!

Hey Ben-

Hope you had a great holiday and you guys are staying busy.  Things down in EIM are looking a little more promising since our current direction is to hold onto some of our assets and potentially take a group of people forward to do some low-credit trading....I'm cautiously optimistic.

I did want your recommendation on any books for someone interested in learning about power trading.  Any ideas?

Thanks Ben-

Erik

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 03:00, 16:00, 17:00 and 21:00 in the
January 23, 2002 Real-Time Market.

In addition, the NYISO is reserving hour beginning 17:00
in the Hour-Ahead locational reserve market.

Prices in the January 24, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

Enron Corporation, The Princeton Review, and the Association of Rice Alumni
would like to invite you to:

THE 2001 HALLOWEEN MONSTER BASH

Houston's definitive, all-out Halloween party:

	Friday, October 26
	8:00 pm
	Garden in the Heights

We are proud to announce the return of the Halloween Monster Bash on Friday,
October 26 at Garden in the Heights.  You may remember this party from 1998;
it was a smash success then and will be at least as much fun this year.
We've got an awesome DJ, and tickets include light food and all the drinks
you can handle.

Door prizes including gift certificates from Houston's finest restaurants
will be awarded for best costumes.

The tickets are essentially at a break-even price, but if there is any money
left over, it will go to Rice's scholarship/fellowship fund, so Rice can
continue to attract even smarter, harder-working students than they've
already got.

DETAILS
Date:  Friday, October 26
Time:  8:00 PM til midnight or so
Place:  Garden in the Heights, 3926 Feagan
	(if you need directions, please call (713) 880-1065)

TICKETS
Tickets:  $25 with costume or $30 without.
How to get tickets:  Call the Rice Alumni Office at (713) 348-4057 for
advance tickets, or buy them at the door.

SPONSORSHIPS
Group and corporate sponsorships are available.  Enron, The Princeton
Review, and the law firm of Hirsch & Westheimer have already signed on as
sponsors.

This party is not exclusive in any way - all of Houston is invited (everyone
over 21, that is).  So please invite your friends and encourage them to
come.

You may get other emails about this as well, as we try our hardest to get
the word out.  I hope to see you there!

RBowers@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

In its Order on Rehearing issued by FERC in Docket ER00-1969-002 on
November 8, 2001, the Commission rejected the NYISO's request for rehearing
to continue to bill for operating reserves based on the $2.52 bid cap in
effect for the period March 1 through March 27, 2000.  FERC also directed
the NYISO to re-calculate operating reserve charges for that period without
the bid cap in place.

On Friday, November 16, 2001, the NYISO filed a stay/extension with FERC in
order  to postpone any re-billing pending an appeal of the FERC decision in
the  Federal Appeals Court. In the event that FERC does not act in a timely
manner   on  the  NYISO's  request,  the  upcoming  March  2000  settlement
adjustment,  expected  to  be  issued  on  or  about December 7, 2001, will
reflect  this  re-calculation in accordance with the FERC Order.  The total
amount  of  this  adjustment  is  approximately  $27 million, which will be
allocated  to the appropriate suppliers and LSE's for the period of March 1
through March 27, 2000.

Prices in the January 13, 2002 Real-Time Market are correct.

The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 21:00 - 23:00 in the January 13,
2002 Hour-Ahead locational reserve market.

Prices in the January 14, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

Rick et al,

I believe I know what is happening here.   With all the many changes lately within Enron, we lost all our mailroom personnel and have replaced them with contract personnel.   It came to our attention that this group had not been informed of the international mailing system we had in place prior to all these changes.   I am waiting to hear from the new "head"  man in the mail room to see if they have located these mailing for you.    I should hear back shortly today and hope to get this all straightened and mail forwarded ASAP.

Linda

Houston, we have a problem.
None of us have received any mail addressed to us at the referenced po box for the past 12  days, this is very unusual and i was expecting
some tax information sent by Mary Helen about 10days ago. Please see if you can find out what is happening. 
If it is discovered that our mail is still lounging somewhere, please send it to our home addresses.
I also may have some tax mail that may have been sent to EB 1732. Please do a quick check for me.

Gerrry, sorry you are ill, get well soon.

The Flipped-Over Rock

February 21, 2002

By WILLIAM SAFIRE




WASHINGTON -- What wife of a United States senator profited
from her close association with a big company that did
heavy lobbying of the federal government and then went
bust, costing investors billions and workers their jobs?

Why, Wendy Gramm, most recently awakened watchdogs would
say, wife of the Republican Phil Gramm of Texas, previous
chairman of the Banking Committee. As a director of Enron,
she was on the audit committee that didn't question the
fast-and- loose auditing, and (subtracting the deferred
compensation that went into the tank) received about
$220,000 over eight years.

That's peanuts, say Republicans. The senatorial wife who
hit it big was Anne Bingaman, married to New Mexico's Jeff
Bingaman, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources
Committee. As lobbyist for the telecommunications comet
Global Crossing, which went bankrupt last month, she
received $2,500,000 for six months' work during 1999.

Both senatorial wives are accomplished executives who
parlayed responsible government appointments into lucrative
private positions.

Wendy Gramm was chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission. Anne Bingaman was Bill Clinton's assistant
attorney general for antitrust until leaving in June 1996.
Her lobbying fee for delaying approval of a competitor's
undersea cable still makes Beltway bandits gasp.

This juxtaposition shows that the Enron scandal is having
only bipartisan political fallout; in this case, the
"everybody did it" defense works. (You can bet that neither
spouse will be subpoenaed and publicly humiliated by the
club member Fritz Hollings at the Commerce Committee.)
Because both the biggest bankrupt (Enron) and the
fourth-biggest bankrupt (Global Crossing) made
contributions to politicians of both parties, the resulting
public disgust has been used to advance bipartisan campaign
finance reform.

Enron, which mostly embarrassed Republicans, has been wrung
dry in the media; the sight of the tilted "E" symbol
elicits yawns from viewers. It's the telecommunications
giant Global Crossing's turn in the barrel; now we'll be
hearing about Clinton connections on its board and its
boss's million-dollar contribution to the Clinton library.

Especially delicious will be the examination of Terry
McAuliffe, the fabled fund-raiser whom Bill Clinton
insisted the Democratic National Committee take on as
chairman. McAuliffe says he merely invested $100,000 in
Global Crossing and sold it for $18 million, and what's the
big deal? What his D.N.C. spokesman won't say is what price
per share he paid before the company went public, and what
that stock was worth when it went on the market - and what
he did to earn the difference. (Same question could be
directed to Bush the elder.)

But after the politicians tire of wounding each other and
declare a truce, we may see some overdue action on the
control of financial derivatives. These are the
investments, often off the books, in futures and currencies
that slice and dice risk and have made instant
billionaires, but whose abuse has been disastrous to
investors from Orange County to Long-Term Capital
Management.

Hedge funds are supposed to spread and reduce risk; in
reality, they are often used to make huge bets unknown to
their institutional investors. Accountants are supposed to
enforce disclosure of all liabilities, but many have become
expert in the concealment of risk.

I don't profess to understand the worries some of my
financial sources express about dangerous excesses in the
convertible bond market, "swaptions" and ever-narrowing
derivatives. But my unwillingness to break my head learning
these intricacies gives the wheeler-dealers an edge.
Complication and secrecy are mother's milk to them, while
the average investor's best protection is full disclosure.

When you flip over a flat rock like Enron or Global
Crossing, you see much panicky scurrying-about by those who
like to work in the dark. For too long, new-economy
corporate creeps and their accounting Heeps have hidden
risk in arcane off-the-books dealing. The new S.E.C.
chairman, Harvey Pitt, seems not to get it: Stop pretending
it's a political scandal and start dealing with the
accounting and derivatives scandal.

-- This week TWST has an interview with the Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
of PDG Environmental, Inc.  He states, "PDG Environmental is an environmental
and specialty contractor. We've been in business since 1984. We have offices
in 14 cities across the country. We are a national contractor with - what we
like to call - a local presence because we are capable of doing the largest
projects as evidenced by a recently awarded $13 million contract with Con Edison
and TRC Companies, but we are also able to respond very quickly to even the
smallest projects in the $10,000 to $50,000 range. Our main lines of work include
asbestos abatement, lead abatement, toxic mold remediation, demolition and
insulation. We are the third largest asbestos abatement contractor in the
country and the thirty-fifth largest environmental contractor."
He continues, "We have been making one or two acquisitions a year for the
past several years. We've recently completed an acquisition of a company in
Southern California, which was our largest acquisition to date. Tri-State
Restorations completed the nationwide geographic presence that we wanted.
There are many opportunities for acquisition out there, and we are looking
to acquire companies with a diversified revenue and customer base."  To read

"May, Tom" <Tom.May@ENRON.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

As usual, Joe has cut directly to the issue and I could not agree more.
While there has been progress made in New York, the NYISO and the New
York market will never gain credibility or the confidence of the market
as long as these situations exist.  While the NYISO may not have the
ability to unilaterally change this, they would at gain some credibility
if they were the ones raising the issue and aggresively and publically
advocating for change.

Joel

My apologies if I mischaracterized the presentation, I simply interpreted
this excerpt from the PSC presentation..

As can be seen from the spreadsheet, no single
supplier, withholding 50 MW, can, on its own, cause the price to rise by the
$100
needed to breach the AMP's $100 price impact threshold. But, if a number of
large players, each acting unilaterally, withhold 50 MW due to the
profitability of
doing so, the combined effect on price could be over $100, which would be
both
very damaging to buyers, and very profitable to suppliers.

In my simple interpretation of the NYISO Market Monitoring Plan it is a
measure of conduct and impact.

As follows from the Market Monitoring Plan..

2.1

Conduct Subject to Mitigation

Mitigation Measures may be applied: (i) to the bidding, scheduling or
operation of an "Electric
Facility," defined for purposes of this Addendum to the Plan as an electric
generation resource or
transmission facility; or (ii) as specified in ? 2.3(b)).

2.3. Categories of Conduct that May Warrant Mitigation

a) The following categories of conduct, whether by a single firm or by
multiple firms acting
in concert, may cause a material effect on prices or guarantee payments in a
New York Electric Market
if exercised from a position of market power. Accordingly, the NYISO shall
monitor the New York
Electric Markets for the following categories of conduct, and shall impose
appropriate Mitigation
Measures if such conduct is detected and the other applicable conditions for
the imposition of Mitigation.


You state that one generator witholding 50 MW does not warrant mitigation
but a number of firms acting "unilaterally" would have an impact and should
be mitigated. The NYISO however according to section 2.3 (in my
interpretation of the Plan) a witholding of 50 MW (using your MW value) by
multiple firms cannot be market power if they are not acting in concert. You
admit that they are acting unilaterally and not acting in concert. If that
is the case the only way these firms should be mitigated is if they are
colluding or acting in concert.

Potentially splitting hairs here and I have no intention of swapping
interpretations of the Market Monitoring Plan when it is clearly the
function of the NYISO market Monitoring Unit, but what is the PSC's position
on one market participant trying to export 500 or 1000 MW to multiple export
points out of the NYISO; will this not have an impact on price, is this
market power because prices may go up?
Hopefully market power is not defined by high prices but by conduct as
defined in the Plan.

Regards..

Joe

Joe Kirkpatrick wrote:

On a side note it is interesting to note that there is a recent
presentation
to the AMP/ICM Task Force by one of the participants that has determined
that if all the large suppliers collude in tandem to withhold 50 MW each
that there could conceivably be an increase in price. While this
conspiracy
theory is of concern to said presenter it would seem highly unlikely,
especially considering that bid load or exports provide a much higher
impact
on price in reality than the unlikely scenario of some large suppliers all
colluding in tandem.


My comment:

This is a serious mischaracterization of what was said.   No collusion is
required.  All that is needed for a large impact on prices from the
exercise of market power is for the generators to act in their own self
interest.

It has come to our attention that a group of employees missed their January 15th 401-K deduction.  This was due to an incorrect employment status being fed by ENRON's SAP system to our 401-K vendor which resulted in your contribution amounts being defaulted to zero.

Your 401-K contribution amounts were restored for the January 31, 2002 payroll.  If you would like to have your contribution for the January 15, 2002 pay date taken on the February 28, 2002 pay date please respond by February 14, 2002.   If we do not receive a response by February 14, 2002 we will assume that you have decided not to have a make up 401-K contribution for the one missed on January 15, 2002.  We are trying to be sensitive to the possible hardship a double deduction could have on your personal financial situation.   If you are not contributing the maximum percentage you could make an adjustment to your contribution percentage going forward to accomodate the missed January 15, 2002 contribution.

As always we encourage all employees to review your investment elections to ensure they are consistent with your investment goals.

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as "taxable" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as "imputed tax". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

JSavitt@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

The NYISO has been experiencing difficulties in posting price reservations
to the TIE.  The postings have from time to time been extraordinarily
delayed.  Our internal process identifies such delays in enough time so
that we can generate another posting by COB of the appropriate day.
Several times the originally delayed posting has shown up on the TIE as
well, resulting in dual postings.  The NYISO apologizes for any confusion.
The NYISO notes that the price reservations are also posted to the OASIS,
and that there have been no problems in tghe latter process.
