Greg, I received the list of players on the PG&E side today from Glynn's 
office.  I called Mark Haedicke to give him the rundown, and he feels 
comfortable with you and Jeff attending the meeting alone.  As Jeff will be 
arriving in Dallas from San Francisco, you will need to get yourself to 
Dallas; however, we will add your name to the manifest for the return to 
Houston unless we hear otherwise from you.  

Below are the details as we know them now:

Date:  Friday, June 22
Time:  12:30 p.m.-2:30 p.m.
Location: 100 Crescent Court, 6th Floor (Wasserstein's offices), Dallas
PG&E players: Bob Glynn, Chairman & CEO, PG&E Corp.
  Gordon Smith, President & CEO, PG&E utility
  Fong Wan, VP, Risk Initiatives, PG&E Corp.
  Ken Beckfire, Wasserstein
  Joe Sauvage, Investment Advisor, Lehman Bros.
ENE players: Jeff Skilling
  Greg Whalley

As new details become available, we'll pass them to you right away.  SRS

Attached is a short memo and summary outlining changes to the Business School 
Loan Program for the Western Hemisphere. As many of you know, over the past 
couple of months we have taken a hard look at our approach to business school 
loans. The updated guidelines better serve Enron's business interests, 
eliminate credit exposure for the company, and potentially broaden the reach 
of the Loan Program. If you have any questions, please contact Ted Bland 
(x35275) who leads Career Development for the Program.

Attached is an invitation to the Summer Picnic this Saturday, June 23 from 
4:00-9:00 pm at the Regal Ranch.  Many of you may have already received this, 
but I wanted to extend my personal invitation to you.  This is a really fun 
activity, and has traditionally been one of the best opportunities to visit 
with our Program participants on an informal basis.  This is a family outing 
with lots of activities for the kids, and you can come and go as you please.

Please make an effort to attend on Saturday, even if you can only join us for 
a little while.  Feel free to pass this invitation on to other executives in 
your business unit.  The Analysts and Associates tell us that this type of 
exposure to our business leaders helps drive excitement and enthusiasm within 
the Program.  Your support of events like this is incredibly valuable, and 
appreciated.

If you can join us, please rsvp to Jackie Coleman by email, or at extension 
x54070.

Thank you,
Billy

In this Violation memo, you are taking out positive P&L associated to a nat 
gas posion in the LPG books which is a true hedge versus some long dated 
propane positions.  When you add back the hedge P&L I believe there is no 
violation.

Subject: CPUC Decision Suspending Direct Access

The following points highlight legal/regulatory recommendations to the 
business team on the DA suspension issue.

All intelligence indicates that the CPUC will act on this issue at its June 
28, 2001 meeting (and there are sufficient votes for the decision).
Existing Contracts - It is our recommendation that EES should submit any and 
all DASRs to initiate DA service  to the appropriate Utility no later than 
June 29, 2001 for all customers that have existing contracts if we want to 
ensure DA service.
New Contracts - All new contracts should be signed by both EES and the 
customer no later than June 30, 2001 (July 1, 2001 is a Sunday).  DASRs for 
these contracts should be submitted to the appropriate Utility as soon as 
possible, but in no event later than July 6, 2001.  The July 6 date is our 
estimate of the last date the Utility would accept DASRs for new contracts.  
It is important to note that the CPUC is keeping the clock on contract 
execution timing.
Switching Option - Customers that are on DA service can be returned to the 
Utility per the tariff process.  Once the customer has been returned to 
Utility service after July 1, 2001, our expectation is that there will be no 
ability to have this customer receive DA service in a future timeframe.  In 
addition, returning to Utility service may incur a "re-entry fee".
Contract Extensions - EES should consider amending all current contracts that 
terminate after July 1, 2001 with a Evergreen Provision that provides for 
Index pricing with 30 day cancellation notice provisions.  These amendments 
should be signed prior to June 30, 2001.  It is possible that the CPUC will 
require marketers to detail the termination dates of their DA customers.  One 
additional thought - EES may consider having the customer assign any Negative 
CTC receivable to EES as compensation for the Evergreen provision (to 
overcome the CPUC language that indicates that the customer is due the 
Negative CTC credit).

We intend to set up a call for 5pm Houston time today to discuss (call-in 
number to follow).

Jeff,

I enjoyed visiting with you, Lou, and Greg last week.
I haven't heard anything back, and so wanted to check
in to see if it's appropriate to schedule a follow up
phone call.  I am leaving for Europe on June 30 and
will be gone for 10 days, so hoped to hear something
before then.  Thanks.

Chad

Greg:

Kevin Hannon and I were meeting yesterday to review various organizational 
issues and one thing he asked me to do was extend a one time only offer to 
take over the assets in Europe that don't really fit with their ongoing 
business - i.e. Turkey, Poland and Sarlux.  An additional question I had is 
whether you think that EWS continues to be the correct place for EEOS.

Your thoughts?

Summary

-Yesterday's hearing confirmed imminent death of SoCal MOU
-Plan(s) B also drew little support; state "trust" for generators unlikely
-QF/SoCal negotiations are "treading water" as SoCal runs out the clock; 
tries to postpone involuntary filing
-BK court unlikely to view SoCal payments to QFs as preferential because of 
state order

Report

1. Few Signs of Legislative Support for SoCal MOU

Sources report that Bryson is in regular contact with many legislators,
but especially with Hertzberg and Keeley on the Assembly side (from which
the Plan B is being directed) and Bowen (Senate Energy Chairperson) on the
Assembly side.  Sources believe that Bryson's comment may about the
legislature 'warming up to the MOU' may be a smokescreen; Democratic Senator
Alarcon said in the MOU hearing yesterday that the MOU is dead and is not
going to pass.  Reportedly no one attempted to contradict him.

Members of the Chamber of Commerce, large energy users,  TURN, the California 
Manufacturers' and Technology Association (CMTA) and  others also spoke out 
against the MOU.  (Sources found it remarkable that  TURN and the CMTA, who 
have been rivals in Plan B negotiations, agreed with each  other in strongly 
attacking the MOU.

2. Plan(s) B Are Still Foundering

 The Plan(s) B were not discussed at the hearing, though some of the same
issues came up.  For instance, it was discussed whether it was possible to
transfer all of Edison's obligations to a trust that pays out after the
conclusion of litigation.  In the opinion of the governor's counsel and
other lawyers present, this is "shaky," especially without the consent of
creditors.  In their opinion, there would have to be an agreement that would
pay off everything.

The governor's counsel stated there were constitutional problems with setting 
up a trust for what the generators are owed, then letting them litigate over 
the trust.  Also, he stated that it was not feasible for the state to be 
offering generators cash on the one hand while the FERC negotiated with them 
to refund the state for power
purchases (as ordered in the FERC decision Monday).  The governor's counsel
stated that the only reasonable thing for the state to do was to give the
generators their cash, then sue them for it.

3. QF/SoCal Negotiations Are "Treading Water"

 QF sources suggest that the debate between SoCal and the PUC as to whether
the QFs should be paid 10% or 15% of what they are owed is "not a real
question," but rather a stalling measure allowing SoCal to hold on to cash
in advance of a filing or a global solution.  "SoCal is just treading water," 
said a source.


4. SoCal Payments to QFs Unlikely to be Viewed As Preference  Payments

Sources also comment that SoCal payments to the QFs likely would not be
seen as a preference payment in bankruptcy court because they were ordered
by a state agency, the PUC.  However, comments made in the SoCal conference
call yesterday seem to indicate that Solomon Smith and perhaps other
creditors may see the payments this way and may be willing to sign a

Friends...

Chris Bartlett at Harvard presented (last week) the 2 most recent Enron cases 
he wrote to the "Harvard Program for Global Leadership".  This is an Exec Ed 
program for CXO's and Senior management from throughout the world. Chris 
called me today to say that the cases received outstanding reviews, and that 
the largely international CXO audience was both knowledgeable about, and very 
'pro-Enron'!

Best!

--Christie.

Dear Friends:

On Tuesday night, Republican Randy Forbes was elected to represent one of the 
most competitive, Democratic-leaning districts in America:  Virginia's 4th 
Congressional District.  President Clinton won the 4th district in 1992 and 
1996, and Republican Senate candidates lost the district in 1998 and 2000 
(even while they won statewide).

Despite the tough odds, Randy Forbes won a hard fought election on the 
strength of a positive message of furthering the programs and policies of 
President Bush.  While his Democrat opponent used scare tactics and negative 
campaigning, Forbes won the district by more than 5,000 votes.

The media labeled this election as a referendum on President Bush.  Democrats 
were desperate to win, but Republicans won another victory in a swing 
district.

To give you a bit of historical perspective, there have been 78 special 
elections over the past 25 years.  Only 19 of those special elections 
resulted in a change of party representation for the seat, and only three of 
those 19 swung toward the party of the President.  Historical odds were not 
in his favor, but Representative-elect Forbes defied the odds.

So what does this history-defying Republican victory mean to us on a national 
level?  The Forbes victory is proof positive of the continuing nationwide 
momentum across the political spectrum for President Bush's agenda for 
America.

And you have been a large part of sustaining the Bush momentum.  You helped 
President Bush and Congress achieve together what critics said couldn't be 
done - a bipartisan $1.35 trillion tax relief package.  The first round of 
tax relief checks was mailed yesterday, and I sincerely appreciate your 
helping American taxpayers get the relief we deserve.

If President Bush is to succeed in improving our schools, rebuilding our 
military, saving Social Security and Medicare and ushering in the 
responsibility era, he will need your continued help and involvement.

President Bush is counting on all of us to become his Team Leaders.  Learn 
more about this unique opportunity to spread the President's message and help 
retain and increase our majorities in 2002 by visiting 
http://www.gopteamleader.com.

Again, thank you for your continued efforts.  Without you, odds are we 
wouldn't have been able to win in Virginia.

Very truly yours,


Jim Gilmore
Chairman, Republican National Committee

Background on VA-04 Special Election
June 20, 2001

Upset in Virginia Special Election

A Victory for White House & National GOP

Republican Team Pulls Together, Victory a Model for
'01 and '02 Elections

-- Last night, Randy Forbes was elected to represent Virginia's 4th district, 
receiving 52.1% (70,926 votes) to Democrat Louise Lucas' 47.9% (65,189 
votes).  This election is a swing district-President Clinton won the district 
by 1% in 1992 and 7% in 1996, while President Bush won the district by less 
than 1,000 votes.

--  In the past 25 years, there have been 78 special elections.  Only 19 
resulted in a change of party representation for the seat, and of the 19, 
only 3 swung toward the party of the President.  Now 4.

--  President Bill Clinton pre-recorded thousands of turnout calls for this 
special election.

-- The voters embraced the President's policies.

-- Most importantly the President's policies were embraced in a moderate 
swing district drawn by Democrats, further evidence that President Bush is 
addressing the issues that affect and unite everyone.

-- Randy Forbes ran on the programs, policies and momentum of President Bush. 
Randy ran on moving the President's policies forward and now the results are 
in and the outcome is clear.

-- Media pundits recognized that this would be a referendum on the President.

Bob Novak, of The Chicago Sun-Times: "A mailing came out from the Democratic 
candidates...saying...there's no doubt who the Bush Republican will help, who 
it will hurt -- six million minority families and 12 million children will be 
left behind."  (CNN's "Inside Politics," 06/07/01)

Mark Shields: "Larry, is this Virginia race really an early referendum on 
President George W. Bush?" U.Va. Professor Larry Sabato: "To a certain agree 
I think it is."  (CNN?s "Capital Gang," 06/16/01)

"Numerous national analysts called the [special election] a test of the two 
parties' strengths and a possible bellwether for the fight for control of the 
House of Representatives in 2002.  Some of the national cachet surrounding 
the contest comes from its status as the first congressional election since 
Vermont Sen. James M. Jeffords' defection from the GOP switched control of 
the Senate?"  (Tyler Whitley, "Lucas, Forbes Push Turnout," The Richmond 
Times-Dispatch, 06/19/01)

"...a contest that's being widely viewed as an early indicator of voter 
attitudes toward Bush and his policies.  The result, said Stuart Rothenberg, 
an independent analyst of congressional campaigns, is that the race looms as 
'a sort of referendum on George W. Bush, on the energy issue, on Social 
Security and on the direction of the country.'  Indeed, Rothenberg and others 
will review the outcome as a possible harbinger for the 2002 midterm 
elections."  (Robert L. Jackson, "Va. House Race May Show GOP What It Faces 
In '02," Los Angeles Times, 06/17/01)

"National politicians view the toss-up race in Virginia's 4th District not 
only as a possible referendum on the Bush administration but also as a 
bellwether race that will determine which party has the momentum heading into 
the 2002 elections."  (Allison Stevens, "Polls See Virginia Race As Preview 
Of Battle For The House In 2002," The Hill, 06/13/01)

Bob Edwards: "The election is being portrayed as a referendum on the Bush 
administration."  (NPR's "Morning Edition," 06/13/01)

Fred Barnes: "This election in the fourth district of Virginia is the Vieques 
of elections.  It's the testing ground for this Social Security issue.  And 
if the Democrat, who is an African- American woman named Louise Lucas, if she 
wins, Democrats are going to rightly conclude, this Social Security issue is 
dynamite, and we can attack Bush's partial privatization bill."  (Fox's "Fox 
News Sunday," 06/17/01)

"Political analysts said the race would be viewed as an early referendum on 
the Bush administration and as a bellwether for next year's midterm 
elections."  (Larry O'Dell, "State Senators Compete For Open Seat In 
Congress," The Associated Press, 06/19/01)

"[T]oday's by-election in Virginia's Fourth District has become a referendum 
on Mr. Bush's first five months. If the Democrats win, they will argue that 
Mr. Bush has once again been rejected and that they have the momentum for 
next year's crucial mid-term elections."  (Damian Whitworth, "Battle Flares 
As Virginia Poll Puts Bush To Test," The London Times, 06/19/01)

Events:

-- GOP Unity, May 10: White House Political Director Ken Mehlman spoke at the 
Chesterfield GOP Unity dinner on May 10.  Chesterfield County was Forbes' 
primary opponents strongest county.

-- Fundraising, June 4: Vice President Cheney spoke at a fundraiser in 
Chesapeake where nearly $100,000 was contributed to the Forbes campaign.

-- Education, June 12: Forbes participated in an inner-city school event in 
Portsmouth where Secretary Paige spoke about the President's Plan to reform 
education.

-- Sportsmen, June 14: Former NASCAR superstar and current FOX racing analyst 
Darrell Waltrip visited a Forbes for Congress picnic, garnering media 
coverage both on the front page and the sports pages of local newspapers.

Grassroots Activity:

-- Mail: President Bush signed his name to an absentee ballot mail piece that 
garnered more than 2,000 responses.  Bob Dole signed a letter that went to 
55,000 veterans and their families.

-- Phones: Over 66,000 phone calls were made with a message from President 
Bush.  45,000 phone calls were made to seniors with a message from Barbara 
Bush.

-- State Parties: 42 GOP State Parties contributed money to the Forbes 
campaign, with the majority of parties sending $5,000, the maximum allowed, 
raising a total of $230,000.

-- Members of Congress: Approximately 130 Members of Congress contributed 
money to the Forbes Campaign, including dozens of leadership PACs.

Other Activities:

-- Veterans, May 19: Secretary Principi attended a Veterans event on May 19 
to reach out to the 150,000 servicemen, former servicemen, and military 
families in the district.

-- Outreach, June 8: Congressman J.C. Watts attended a Forbes event in a 
heavily African-American part of the district with pastors and community 
leaders.

In providing an answer to our questions regarding risk assessment or 
management, would you please provide an explanation to the following?  We 
understand that EOL requires that a counter party, before accessing EOL to do 
business with Enron North America, must undergo a credit worthiness 
evaluation.   When a counter party executes or clicks on a price, EOL does an 
instant credit check before confirming the transaction.

However, Enron may not only buy from a counter party, it may sell.  What sort 
of creditworthiness standards must Enron provide to a counter party utilizing 
EOL to purchase from Enron?

Are there industry standard creditworthiness agreements regarding counter 
party credit risk that Enron uses?  If yes, may we have copies?  If Enron 
utilizes its own agreements, please provide us with a copy.

Thank you.

John,

The news story relates to this report that DWR released today.  They held a 
press release.  They said that the state would honor all of the executed 
agreements, but any non-binding "agreements in principle" would be subject to 
renegotiation.  In general, they say they have executed about 6,000MW of long 
term agreements and about 5,000MW under "agreements in principle".  

DWR signed our Master Agreement.  We are holding off signing it because of 
litigation risk, per Tim and Legal.

Greg, 

You and I met at your office last summer to discuss Aprimo's Marketing 
Management Solution. At the time, you indicated that there would be other 
people at Enron that I should speak with. My assigned territory changed

once again responsible for Enron, and would appreciate your direction to the 
appropriate individuals at Enron.

Our web-based solution has been adopted by over 60 leading companies over the 
past 18 months. They are seeing rapid value from Aprimo's unique ability to 
help them Grow Top-Line Revenue (more effective Marketing) and Reduce 
Bottom-line Cost (more efficient Marketing). With the opportunities facing 
Enron, I'm certain that maximizing your Marketing Investments is of interest 
to the Executive Team and your Shareholders.

Our solution is delivering improvements across all Marketing Functions, such 
as: 

- Event Management 
- Marcom

In the same Decision that the CPUC is considering voting out on suspending 
Direct Access, the CPUC is considering a SoCal Edison recommendation to 
suspend further payment of the Negative CTC to marketers.

The Decision would find that the earlier Stipulation does not require SCE to 
make a cash payment in lieu of a bill credit (even though SCE has already 
paid cash in previous periods for the Negative CTC).
The Decision orders SCE to not make cash payments to satisfy the Negative CTC 
credit.
The Decision is unclear as to whether or not this is simply a suspension of 
payment or would be permanent.
The Decision would apply the same findings and rulings to PG&E and SDG&E.

The key issue is that rather than having a cash receivable, EES would now 
have a bill credit receivable.  In addition, because EES re-sourced its 
customers, the Utility account that holds the bill credit is EES, not the 
customer account.  The only method to obtain the economic value of the bill 
credit is to utilize the Utilities' services.  Even if EES physically serves 
the customers going forward, it may not be the same account that has the bill 
credit.  

The outcome of this case would impact our current Complaint, but it is 
unclear exactly how the CPUC would apply this Decision to that case.

We are intending to (a) try to remove this issue from the CPUC Decision, (b) 
trying to clarify the suspension is not meant as a vehicle to deny us 
payment, and (c) trying to determine that the Utilities' tariff would allow 
us to be paid if our account became "inactive".

One other option to consider (at least for SCE) would be to contact SCE 
management to work out a bill credit application process to allow EES to 
route the economic value to our DA customers.  

If anyone has any questions, please call me to discuss.

Jim

As you may have heard, President Bush signed the Economic Growth and Tax 
Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 into law (the "Law") this morning.  The Law 
reduces personal income tax rates, modifies the AMT and Estate Tax and makes 
several changes to retirement and education savings incentives.  Further, due 
to the reduction in the personal income tax rates (through the creation of a 
new 10 percent tax bracket carved out from the previous 15 percent bracket) 
without a reduction to the amount currently withheld under the Federal 
withholding tax regime, all taxpayers are slated to receive a rebate of taxes 
that otherwise would have been paid this year - this is the $300, 500 or 600 
"tax refund" that you may have heard of in connection with the Law.  The 
attached documents describe in greater detail the changes I have just 
described.  As always, I can be reached at x30938 should you have any 
questions.  Best regards.  SHD.

What ?
We had $89m of value-at-risk concentrated primarily in Nymex short positions 
through July, August and September 01and we were $30m over our VaR limit for 
this commodity as at last night's close.
I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't say this looks way out of bounds.
Has this been sanctioned ?

Priggish and piggish in California 
Mark Steyn 
National Post 
A hurricane devastated Tristan da Cunha last month. It swept in May 23, but 
no one heard about it till the other day because it damaged the island's 
radio link to the outside world. The storm blew sheep into the chilly South 
Atlantic, killed many cattle, damaged every single home on the island, 
demolished the hospital and community centre, blew the roof off the radio 
station, and wrecked the Albatross, the only pub in the only village, 
Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. For a week after the storm, the entire island 
was without electricity.
And no one in the rest of the world knew a thing about it! Not the island's 
colonial masters in London. Not the Governor, who doesn't actually reside 
there but prefers to live 1,260 miles away on St. Helena, Tristan da Cunha's 
nearest neighbour. (St. Helena is Manhattan to Tristan's Weehawken, New 
Jersey.) Plunked in the ocean midway between Argentina and South Africa, 
Tristan da Cunha is the world's most isolated human settlement. Its contact 
with the rest of humanity is limited to one annual visit from a British 
supply vessel, plus the occasional cruise ship, which anchors offshore when 
it's safe to do so.
Now that's living off the grid.
The East India Company won a charter to settle Tristan in 1658, and it's been 
a Crown colony since 1834, populated by a handful of families from the 
Scottish borders. There are just seven surnames on the island: Glass, Green, 
Hagan, Lavarello, Repetto, Rogers and Swain. All 290 of them turned up in 
London 40 years ago, when the island's volcano erupted and they were 
evacuated to the Imperial capital. In the roaring traffic's boom, midst the 
glitter of one of the world's great cities, the islanders voted to return 
home -- though even getting there was tricky, as their landing dock was 
covered in lava. Today the colony is virtually self-sufficient in food and 
has a reasonably thriving economy based on crawfish and selling its 
commemorative postage stamps to overseas philatelists.
London has offered o75,000 to repair the communications equipment and pay for 
a new hospital. (You can build a hospital for under 75,000 quid? Amazing.) 
Otherwise, the islanders are just doing what they usually do: making the best 
of things. While they're waiting for the new hospital, they've arranged for a 
South African fishing vessel to ferry out a second-hand X-ray machine when it 
sails next week.
Now, consider by way of contrast, the inhabitants of what George W. Bush 
amusingly calls "the great state of California." Once upon a time, California 
was, like they say of Tristan da Cunha, "the furthest thing," at least in 
terms of the North American continent. Today, with a population the size of 
Canada's, it's one of the world's largest economies, the home base of 
America's biggest industry -- entertainment. But inside many a studio 
vice-president is a Tristan da Cunha islander trying to get out. Deep in 
their hearts (assuming, for the purposes of discussion, that studio 
vice-presidents have hearts), they share the same rugged virtues as the 
Tristanians, though they prefer something a little better than a $100,000 
hospital and they've no desire to scrape a living from catching crawfish, but 
if the pool boy wants to have a go up the deep end he's welcome to try.
And therein lies the contradiction. California's self-inflicted energy crisis 
has exposed the preposterousness of poseur-conservationism in a booming 
economy. Which state has the most rigorous conservation program? California. 
Which has the lowest per capita electricity consumption? California. And 
which state is panicking at the prospect of a summer of rolling blackouts? By 
now impeccably progressive California should have learned the hard way that 
conservation is not a viable policy for a non-stagnant economy.
Instead, a rolling blackout here, a rolling blackout there, and they're 
running around like headless chickens. Governor Gray Davis is lashing out at 
everyone in sight -- Bush and Cheney are "irresponsible," the power 
generators are "unconscionable" -- no, wait, they're "snakes" and "robber 
barons." And how do you treat unconscionable robber snakes like Ken Lay, CEO 
of Enron Corp.? "I would love," said Bill Lockyer, California's 
Attorney-General, "to personally escort Lay to an 8x10 cell that he could 
share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey.' "
As the state's Attorney-General, Mr. Lockyer cannot summarily sentence 
citizens to anal rape, but no doubt, once the guy's convicted, he can make 
some quiet recommendations as to appropriate cell mates. Fortunately for Mr. 
Lay, as chief exec of the world's largest energy trader, he doesn't live in 
California, he lives in Texas. Indeed, very few of the folks the State of 
California would like to sic Spike on are within their jurisdiction: 
Doubtless the taxpayers of British Columbia, whose BC Hydro has been living 
high off the hog on California's woes, could also use a little light buggery, 
but I can't see a Canadian court approving extradition. Nevertheless, in a 
state that's over-regulated, bans new power plants and is addicted to price 
caps, Mr. Lockyer has ingeniously managed to come up with yet another 
disincentive for anybody in the energy business to relocate to La-la-land.
California bought into the soft-eco Sierra Club illusion -- that somehow one 
could be a conservationist, with no consequences for one's economic 
well-being. To put it in terms Californians can understand: Suppose you build 
a house out in the desert. But you don't want to buy a car, because that's 
bad for the environment, isn't it? So instead every morning you call a 
taxicab in the city to drive out, pick you up and take you into the office. 
Not only does it have no environmental benefit but there's no point bitching 
and whining because the driver charges you a fare that bears no relation to 
the cost of gas.
Yet that's what Governor Davis and the Anal Attorney are demanding: price 
caps. Through its own incompetence, California is wholly dependent on energy 
generators and distributors from other jurisdictions. But it expects those 
companies to forgo the interests of their own stockholders and service 
California -- i.e., Hollywood and Silicon Valley -- as an act of public 
welfare. "A 500% profit is swine-like, piggish and totally unreasonable," 
says Medea Benjamin of the California human rights group Global Exchange.
She may have a point, but, if California's going to institute price caps, 
they might like to start closer to home. After all, if Enron's board members 
don't really need those big salaries, do Paramount's or Universal's? I mean, 
sure, Ken Lay has an easy job, but how difficult is it for an exec honcho in 
Century City to sit at a desk and greenlight another John Travolta flop every 
couple of months? I mean, surely, the guy could do the job on, oh, $25,000 a 
year. And that'd be good for conservation, 'cause he'd have to give up the 
Merc and the Cherokee and the LearJet and take the bus. And how about 
Travolta? Instead of $20-million per picture, maybe he could get by on just 
two or three and the remaining $17-million could be put into those renewable 
energy projects he's so keen on. I mean, a $20-million salary isn't just 
swine-like, it's piggish, right?
Since its entry into the Union, California has had what we 19th-century 
imperialists call "responsible government." Tristan da Cunha doesn't. Yet its 
community leaders are behaving far more maturely and responsibly than 
California's. Gray Davis is acting not like the elected Governor of an 
American state but the appointed Governor of a Crown colony, feverishly 
cabling head office to send somebody out to rescue him. You're on your own, 
man. And, if California conservationists find rolling blackouts too onerous, 
they should try spending a week in the dark, cut off from the outside world 
and knowing that, even when the radio starts working again, it's going to 
take months for the second-hand X-ray machine to arrive.

Jeff and Greg,

Operationally, we are doing great, with tremendous press coverage (USA
Today, CNN, Newsweek, Boston Globe, etc...), growing traffic, and lots of
praise for our site and concept.  On the business development front, we are
now talking seriously with eBay about a distribution arrangement and with
Northwest about expanding to their full route system.

Meanwhile, we are running out of cash.  The money we've got in the bank will
last through early August (assuming an orderly shut-down).  In order to keep
our business development efforts alive, we're trying to raise $500k at a low
valuation in the next 30 days.  Would you be willing to consider a portion
of this amount as a personal investment?

Attached is an up-to-date overview of where we stand.

Best,
Frank Levy

Thank you for your hospitality.  There were a couple of questions I had 
regarding our visit, some of which we left you with before our return to 
Washington.

I understood Dave Forster to state that EOL does not collect data regarding 
where a customer's mouse is moving on the system.  However, does EOL require 
customers to have cookies enabled?   If yes, does EOL collect, use or manage 
data regarding cookies?

Also, why doesn't EOL publish a "ticker" of completed trades showing prices 
and quantities?  Does EOL have any plans to start publishing such data?  If 
yes, when?

In addition, how does the data collection from EOL/Enron Networks flow to the 
risk management groups?  How is the information used?

Also, we assume that data regarding each trade is maintained by EOL.  If yes, 
in what form and for how long?

Thanks

THE FINAL WORD 
CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF AN ENORmous stupidity crisis. Californians have 
been sitting in the dark because ... they didn't turn the lights on.
They say they're short of electricity. Yes, they are. Between 1988 and 1998, 
California's electricity consumption increased by 15 percent. Meanwhile 
California's capacity to generate electricity shrank by five percent, even as 
the state hesitated to build new power lines to tap into neighboring states' 
power supplies. 
Californians didn't want dams across their rivers, derricks on their ocean, 
power lines across their borders, or fossil fuel smoke in their sky. These 
might interfere with all the smart things Californians do, such as 
hang-glide. California was going to rely on "negawatts" - dramatic power 
conservation. (But California regulators put price controls on electricity 
that lowered prices, and even Californians weren't dumb enough to skip a 
bargain.) And California was going to rely on alternative power generation. 
With all the puffery from Silicon Valley dot.com start-ups, wind farms 
wouldn't be a problem. And doesn't Gwyneth Paltrow's star shine bright enough 
to operate a solar panel? But it turns out that alternative power generation 
is an alternative, mostly, to generating power. 
Californians are people who insist on growing their own vegetables, but they 
won't dig up the pretty lawn, won't plant anything for fear of getting dirty, 
and they use fragrant bath salts from The Body Shop instead of smelly 
compost. Let them make their crudites with crab grass. President Bush was 
wrong to grant an extension of executive orders requiring out-of-state 
utilities to supply power to California. And everyone is wrong to listen to 
Californians whine about electricity deregulation. 
There never was any deregulation. The California Public Utilities Commission 
merely changed its regulations, which apparently weren't stupid enough to 
meet Golden State standards. Under California's 1996 re-regulation plan, 
electric companies sold their generating plants and became distributors. They 
were required to buy their power on the wholesale spot market and forbidden 
to enter into any long-term power supply contracts. Retail electricity prices 
were lowered by 10 percent and frozen at the new rate until March 2002. 
This is like requiring A&P to sell you porterhouse at $2 a pound, no matter 
what the price of beef on the hoof. Imagine how many steaks there would be, 
and how many supermarkets. Go to one of those boarded-up grocery stores, 
purchase a phantom T-bone, screw it into a ceiling fixture, and try to light 
your house. You're in California. 
Californians devised a system of electricity sales that ignored every 
dimension of the free market. (Interesting that the "Information Economy" is 
centered in a place that's immune to information.) The free market is a 
yardstick, and Californians got smacked with it. Mideast oil jitters, cold 
weather, natural gas price spikes, and the plain unpredictable freedom of the 
free market caused wholesale electricity costs to rise and California 
utilities to go $12 billion into the red. 
California's governor Gray Davis responded with the full force of bikini 
beach brain. In a January 8 speech to the state legislature, Davis proposed 
creating a state agency to buy generating plants and build new ones. He 
threatened to expropriate power generators and transmission grids. He called 
for laws to allow criminal prosecution of wholesale suppliers who withheld 
electricity from California markets. And he said the state's universities and 
community colleges would build co-generating plants and become energy 
independent. (With gas produced by the cafeteria food?) Gray Davis sounded 
like Joseph Stalin with the IQ of Keanu Reeves. "Everyone should understand 
that there are other, more drastic measures that I am prepared to take if I 
have to," Davis declaimed. 
"Take" is the key word. Grabby Californians tried to regulate themselves into 
some cheap electricity. Hoggish California power companies went along because 
the stateimposed retail price ceiling was also a retail price floor. 
According to the Los Angeles Times, during the first 28 months of the scheme, 
Pacific Gas and Electric and California Edison made $20 billion from the 
legally required mark-up between wholesale and retail electric prices. 
Californians want to snatch that money back. "Consumer advocates around 
California... said it did not matter that the utilities were returning 
investments to their shareholders," reported the January 31 Washington Post. 
"They took the money and ran," said state senator John Burton. As opposed to 
Californians, who took the electricity and roller-bladed? Now the juice and 
the jack are both gone, and the California legislature has had to pass a bill 
authorizing $10 billion to try to clean up the mess. 
But the Californians could still pull a scam. The bill mandates long-term 
power contracts at rates that are way above what future prices should be. The 
hope, one guesses, is that Congress, or the President, or somebody will let 
the state skip out on those contracts once the costs are lower. 
It would be wrong to call Californians stupid. They're sleazy, too.

Late last night, BKH requested ENA to guaranty the indemnification 
obligations of TLS Investors, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ECT and the Member 
Manager of Southwest Power LLC.  The guaranty will be capped at the adjusted 
purchase price, presently expected to be in the range of $205 million to $220 
million, and will remain in place for 18 months from the Closing Date.

RAC's view is that exposure under such a guaranty would not be materially 
different from exposure under a direct indemnity provided by ENA if ENA were 
the actual legal entity selling Southwest Power LLC.  RAC supports the 
issuance of such guaranty to facilitate completion of the divestiture.

The following points highlight legal/regulatory recommendations to the 
business team on the DA suspension issue.

All intelligence indicates that the CPUC will act on this issue at its June 
28, 2001 meeting (and there are sufficient votes for the decision).
Existing Contracts - It is our recommendation that EES should submit any and 
all DASRs to initiate DA service  to the appropriate Utility no later than 
June 29, 2001 for all customers that have existing contracts if we want to 
ensure DA service.
New Contracts - All new contracts should be signed by both EES and the 
customer no later than June 30, 2001 (July 1, 2001 is a Sunday).  DASRs for 
these contracts should be submitted to the appropriate Utility as soon as 
possible, but in no event later than July 6, 2001.  The July 6 date is our 
estimate of the last date the Utility would accept DASRs for new contracts.  
It is important to note that the CPUC is keeping the clock on contract 
execution timing.
Switching Option - Customers that are on DA service can be returned to the 
Utility per the tariff process.  Once the customer has been returned to 
Utility service after July 1, 2001, our expectation is that there will be no 
ability to have this customer receive DA service in a future timeframe.  In 
addition, returning to Utility service may incur a "re-entry fee".
Contract Extensions - EES should consider amending all current contracts that 
terminate after July 1, 2001 with a Evergreen Provision that provides for 
Index pricing with 30 day cancellation notice provisions.  These amendments 
should be signed prior to June 30, 2001.  It is possible that the CPUC will 
require marketers to detail the termination dates of their DA customers.  One 
additional thought - EES may consider having the customer assign any Negative 
CTC receivable to EES as compensation for the Evergreen provision (to 
overcome the CPUC language that indicates that the customer is due the 
Negative CTC credit).

We intend to set up a call for 5pm Houston time today to discuss (call-in 
number to follow).

Our outside Regulatory Counsel has heard that the CPUC will definitely vote 
to suspend direct access on June 28 effective July 1.  We will be working 
through formal comments and informal discussions to clarify the meaning of 
the this suspension.

We are still working to try and modify the Proposed Decisions as they relate

Mike Day just called to say he has heard the California PUC definitely will 
vote on June 28 to suspend direct access, effective July 1, except for 
written contracts executed prior to July 1, 2001.    Suspension of DA has 
been identified by the Governor as a necessary prerequisite to bond 
issuance.

In March I left a message for you explaining that I was accepting an offer  
from ElPaso. That decision followed my having brought together the pieces of  
a project that John Nowland indicated Enron was not prepared to consider and  
my subsequent presentation of the project to ElPaso who embraced the deal. 

John indicated that the 90 day delay he inserted into our discussions  
resulted from your having considered Trammo. I understand that Trammo is no  
longer a target for Enron and wondered, therefore, if our getting together  
for an hour would be timely. 
The industry still presents a target rich environment and you are still the  
biggest horse in the race. 
Kind Regards, 
George Dorsey

The following is a status update regarding the agreed upon decision to 
allocate Drift to the Business Units on April 26, 2001:

 A methodology and systems reporting have been developed and an analysis 
prepared for the period Jan 2001 - April 2001.  During May, discussions were 
held with each of the business units regarding the methodolgy which applies 
to all business units and the analysis of results for Jan- April.  

A request was made to begin the Drift Allocation process from April 2001.  

During this week, we are meeting with the business units to review April and 
May numbers and processes.  We are expecting to allocate April and May to the 
individual business unit's Drift lines next week.   

June numbers will be accumulated on the DPR in an Intra-Month Allocated Drift

In this Violation memo, you are taking out positive P&L associated to a nat 
gas posion in the LPG books which is a true hedge versus some long dated 
propane positions.  When you add back the hedge P&L I believe there is no 
violation.

Subject: Enron Center North/Enron Center South Damage & Restoration Overview

Bill/Philippe-

Below is a summary of the major problems which occurred the past 96 hours and 
the steps taken to mitigate the damage and risk.

Enron Center North (1400 Smith)

As a result of the flooding downtown, approximately six skyscrapers had their 
electrical vaults flooded and began to cause cascading problemd in the 
electrical grid downtown. The net result was the loss of one of the two 35kv 
circuits which serve 1400 Smith. We (engineers, EES Maint, electrical subs)  
believe at the time the circuits blew we shifted from three phase to single 
phase power, which caused an imbalance in the load to the building. 

Consequently, UPS "C" which serves a portion of the Lv 34 Data Ctr, the Rolm 
phone switch, and a protion of the Traders floors lost a circuitboard, and 
blew two internal fuses. This power degradation caused PDU "S" on Lv 34 to 
trip its main breaker and shutdown power load to servers and equipment on 
this PDU. This occurred shortly after Noon on Saturday.

Response/Restoration

> UPS "D" transferred load from UPS "C" as the N+1 back up and carried the 
full load of the UPS loss as designed
> EPSC/electrical sub (Henderson Electric); EES Maint; IT worked together to 
power down systems to begin repair work by 4:00pm Saturday
> EPSC/EES Maint coordinated with Pillar/Henderson Elec to obtain replacement 
parts and begin the repairs. By 9:30pm all repairs to UPS"C" had been made 
and the system bought back on line. As a measure of extra protection the back 
up genset for Enron Ctr North  was in operation
> Reliant Energy restored the circuit at approximately 10:30pm Saturday 
evening
> EPSC/EES Maint and subs conducted a thorough review of all electrical and 
back up systems Saturday evening
> Enron Network IT Operations began restoration of all affected systems 
Saturday evening
> EPSC/EES Maint obtained diesel fuel and topped off all gensets Saturday in 
case of additional problems and due to fuel consumption during the outage

Other Building damage was limited to flooding in the tunnels, and water 
damage/flooding to portions of the Body Shop on Lv B-1

Enron Center South (1500 Louisiana)

Impact/Damage Summary

> Levels 8 & 9  received very limited amounts of water from the core area 
elevator shafts and exterior curtainwall. There was no exposure to water on 
any systems or network cabling during the entire period. (Response) Crews 
contained and cleaned all water as it traced into the building.
> ALL IDF closets on Lvs 3-5 Traders Floors remained dry throughout the 
duration of the rains/flooding on Friday & Saturday
> Lv 6 received some water from Lv 7. (Response) The area was contained and 
cleaned. No additional damage beyond Tuesday evenings flooding occurred
> Due to extreme street flooding and water pressure, a 10" sanitary sewer 
line tied into ECS burst on Friday evening causing extensive flooding of Lv  
B-1 area (approximately 4-6 inches of water in the basement. (Response)  
Clark & Way Engr was able to install a temporary plug in the line to stop the 
on going flood waters from penetrating the basement. Clean up has continued 
throughout the weekend   
> Due to the extreme flooding and water pressure, the water seal of the 
Reliant Vault burst early Saturday and flooded the electrical vault room with 
24-30" of water. This resulted in a complete loss of power at approximately 
1:30pm on Staurday afternoon. The back up systems engaged and operated per 
design to support the Data Ctr and Traders Floors. The temporary cooling 
tower went off line. Prior to the flooding Clark had been in the process of 
tieing in the temporary feed into the back up system by 7-1-01 in prep for 
the migration (Response) 
 * Clark used back up water pumps to pump out and clean the Reliant 
electrical vault, as well as maintained operation of the back up systems
 * The Data Ctr AHU's were kept on line with the dehumidifiers/blowers to 
modulate the airflow in the Data Ctr. EPSC had Way Engr techs use 
temp/humidity probes
    to monitor the areas. The recordings indicated temps on Lvs 8 & 9 did not 
exceed 78 degrees and relative humidity did not exceed 68% during the outage
 * Clark/Fisk Elec/EPSC coordinated desing efforts and obtained gear on an 
emergency basis and completed the tie in off the temporary coolong tower to 
the 
    generators by 10:30pm
 * Reliant Energy is still cleaning and replacing gear in th vault room. 
Presntly (AT 11:00PM Sunday) we have one circuit operational in the building 
and 50% of the
              Reliant  gear on line). We are still operating all systems 
safely on the back up sytems for the past 36 hours. It is expected Relaint 
will be complete by 7:00am.
   Clark; the engineers and MEP subs shall be conducting a thorough system 
review and repirs as required of all systems throughout the building during 
the coming
   week.

In summary, the back up systems in both facilities did engage and operate as 
designed; however, due to the extreme conditons and stress placed upon the 
systems the facility held up extremely well. I would also like to note 
throughout the ordeal beginning Friday evening through Sunday, everyone 
(Enron NetWorks;EES FacilitiesClark Const;Way Engring;Fisk Electric;Henderson 
Electric; KW-Pillar;Hines) did an outstanding job under enourmous pressure 
and the most severe conditions I have seen in downtown Houston. 
Communication, around the clock work  and cool heads managed to assess damage 
and develop action/restoration plans to facilitate repairs for Monday business

Let me know if you need further details on specific issues or items.

regards-

Henry

Three headed monster, (Dave, Ken and Greg)

For the next 30-45 days, I will be dealing with many integration, logistical 
and new strategy issues.  During that time, I will provide you with a weekly 
update email as to our activities.  Once I have our new strategy mostly 
baked, I will schedule a meeting to get your collective views and feedback.  
I expect that will be at the end of July.  After that, I hope to have regular 
monthly meetings with you

Meanwhile, here is what is happening:

? Personnel - Top priority was to immediately address personnel issues.  My 
target is to reduce the 54 people associated with this effort to an ideal 
structure of 28.  I concluded a week long interview and review process to 
select VP's/Directors/Managers.  The result was the following: 
 New Group
 MD -  Gene Humphrey will remain during a transition period (3 months) and 
will then retire (this was consistent with his own goals).
 VP -  Patrick Hickey (EBS)
   Barbara Paige (EIP)
   Dick Lydecker (Special Assets - his entire group (10) remains in tact)
   Jempy Neyman (Special Assets)
   Andrew Marsden (EBS - London)
 Director  Steven Sheldon (EBS)
   Kevin Kuykendall (EWS)
   John Godbold (EIP)
   John Enerson (Special Assets)
 Manager Kyle Kettler (EWS)
   Michel Nezi Marvin (EBS)
   Mark Gandy (EBS)
   Patrick Johnson (Special Assets)
   Mark Meier (Special Assets)

 Redeployed
 VP -   Jon Thomsen (EBS)
   Michael Miller (EWS)
 Director  Charlie Vetters (EWS)
 Manager Mic Johns (EIP - Washington D.C.)
   Jennifer Adams (EWS)
   Christain Hackett (EBS - London)
   Andreas Kraemer (EWS)
   Fabricio Soares (EIP)

 Next we are evaluating the Analyst/Associates/Admins.  This will be 
completed by June 19.  This will be decreased from 28 people to 15 people.

? Integration - A detailed integration plan is underway (more in the coming 
weeks).  This will begin with a full day offsite on June 20th.  You are 
welcome to attend.

? New Strategy - We are working towards a new strategy and charter.

? Funding sources - Patrick Hickey is working with Shirley Hudler, Michael 
Kopper and others to restructure part of JEDI II, in order to optomize that 
vehicle for our investment needs.  This will hopefully take shape in the next 
30 days.

Thanks,

KG

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
? SoCal. Ed MOU Introduced as Bill
? House Committee Douses Emergency Energy Relief Act

MOU Has Its Day
Sources report that California Senator Polanco has introduced the legislation 
today for the MOU between the Governor and SoCal Edison (SB 78XX).  As 
reported earlier, sources still believe that there is not sufficient 
legislative support for this measure to pass.  Senator Polanco's political 
career was earlier jeopardized by personal scandal and now sources feel his 
MOU sponsorship may be nothing more than a quid pro quo attempt to gain 
support from Davis.  Additionally, the CPUC has added two necessary MOU 
provisions to its next week voting agenda, though support for these issues 
remains weak on the CPUC board.   

House Energy Relief Efforts
The House Energy and Commerce Committee gave up plans to ease California's 
energy woes because Republicans and Democrats could not settle a long 
standing debate over price caps in the West.  Representative Waxman admitted 
a compromise was never more than a noble idea throughout the debates, and 
several delayed mark-up sessions for the bill.  Barton noted the bill had 
little chance of aid California considering the time it would take to pass 
the bill would be longer than the California summer.

Subject: Dabhol -- A Brief Legal Update

Gentlemen -

A few updates:

The power station and LNG contractors terminated their respective 
construction contracts over the weekend.

Rebecca McDonald and Ken Lay met with the India Minister of Finance on 
Saturday in New York.  The Minister reiterated India's position that they 
would not buy any power from Dabhol.

We had a conference call with management of GE and Bechtel last week.  There 
is little evident disagreement amongst the sponsors on key issues.  Bechtel 
even complimented Rebecca on her team and handling of the matter.  Walter 
Stuart from V&E came over to listen in on the phone call on behalf of Enron.  
Given the increasing cooperation of the sponsors and written statements of GE 
and Bechtel approving Enron's handling of ongoing issues, we have kept V&E's 
involvement fairly "low key" to date.

Bruce

We had a good visit with the FERC staff yesterday.  Their questions primarily 
focused on the business aspects of EOL (for example, how the different 
business units of trading and accounting/back office interface with the 
software and engineering aspects of EOL).  The attorney had two outstanding 
questions:

1.  What regulations govern EOL or the trades done on EOL?
2.  What types of internal controls are in place with regard to risk 
management of Enron's gas and power trading.  For example, what is the 
ability of Enron to take a position that could potentially affect the 
industry as a whole?

We plan to coordinate a possible call to the FERC attorney by regarding the 
regulation question.  In addition, Steve Kean plans to coordinate a call to 
the attorney with Rick Buy (or other appropriate risk management personnel.)

True, but the limits and associated P&L notifications relate to commodity 
groups rather than business units - they used to be the same. Unfortunately, 
where we have become more sophisticated and, as in this case legitimately 
hedge a natural exposure with some other commodity, the latter commodity (and 
associated P&L) gets counted in the commodity "cut".

Loss notifications, especially, serve as a "flag", and provided the 
explanation makes sense and everyone who needs to make a decision about it, 
can do so, then it serves its purpose. The other upside is that when, 
sometime in the future, we have to refer back to an event, we have good 
"institutional memory".

I talked to Brent about this yesterday - my advice was that notifications 
would be better drafted by those closest to the positions (i.e. his mid 
office groups)

In this Violation memo, you are taking out positive P&L associated to a nat 
gas posion in the LPG books which is a true hedge versus some long dated 
propane positions.  When you add back the hedge P&L I believe there is no 
violation.

Subject: Dabhol -- A Brief Legal Update

Gentlemen -

A few updates:

The second Bombay High Court hearing was held today.  The court asked DPC to 
go away for a week and try to continue discussions with MSEB.  The parties 
are to return to the court in a week for another hearing.  We are not 
entirely sure why the court made this request -- it has nothing to do with 
the MERC jurisdiction issue before the court.  One possible positive 
interpretation:  The court feels the need to generate some positive publicity 
("I tried to encourage a positive outcome") before ruling in our favor on the 
jurisdiction issue.  But, again, the court's motives are not clear.

We still don't know if some or all of the lenders will try to cure the 
construction contract defaults this week.  I would expect that we would 
receive formal termination letters over the weekend from the contractors if 
the contractors are not paid in full this week.  

Some of you are aware that DPC's relationship with its Indian outside counsel 
has recently shown some strain.  That strain did not affect the quality of 
DPC's representation at the Bombay High Court hearing.  However, I'm also 
pretty sure that the strain has not been permanently "fixed" and that further 
efforts will be required in this regard.  Gail Brownfeld and Jim McCartney 
are helping DPC with these issues.

Bruce

At Enron, we=01,re good at a lot of things:  making markets, commoditizing=
=20
products, managing risk, offering innovative energy solutions to customers =
=01)=20
the list goes on and on.  However, one of the things we could do a lot bett=
er=20
is watching our expenses.  We=01,re all shareholders in this company, and w=
e=20
need to spend our company=01,s dollars as wisely as we spend our own.

There are some simple, yet significant measures each of us can take to make=
=20
sure we=01,re careful with Enron=01,s money.  The Policy Committee has appr=
oved and=20
recommended the following:

? Professional Services =01) This is our largest area of discretionary spen=
ding,=20
at more than $600 million last year. =01&Professional Services=018 includes=
 our=20
contracts with outside law and accounting firms, contractors and other=20
consulting groups.  To make sure that we are negotiating the best rates and=
=20
terms of service for the company across business units, we are requiring al=
l=20
future professional service contracts and those up for renewal to be=20
negotiated through or in consultation with Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS),=
=20
effective July 1.  In addition, contracts for more than $5,000 must be=20
pre-approved by the business unit senior executive or their designee and=20
GSS.  For more information, see http://ibuyit.enron.com.

? On-line expense reporting tool XMS =01) XMS, our online expense reporting=
=20
tool, enables us to expedite, monitor and report expenses.  Effective July =
1,=20
all employees on domestic U.S. payroll will be required to use XMS for=20
reimbursement of business-related expenses. To access XMS, go to=20
http://xms.enron.com/. =20

? Enterprise wide portal =01) We currently have 122 internal web sites acro=
ss=20
the company.  The amount of technology work, marketing collateral, and othe=
r=20
related costs required to develop and support so many portals is sizeable. =
=20
It makes sense to have one Enron portal so you can efficiently access conte=
nt=20
and services through a single, personalized channel that will make it easie=
r=20
for you to find information and perform basic tasks online.  This new=20
company-wide portal, under the leadership of Tony Mends, will be launched i=
n=20
several phases beginning this fall. =20

Another significant area where we can be more diligent in our spending is=
=20
travel and entertainment.  Enron has long had travel policies in place.  As=
=20
we have grown, we have not done as well as we should have in communicating=
=20
those policies to new employees and reminding all employees to take advanta=
ge=20
of the discounts we have negotiated.  The availability of discounts and=20
booking services online should make it easy to save money for the company=
=20
without sacrificing the comfort of employees who travel.  The following are=
=20
common sense recommendations that we should all adhere to when traveling fo=
r=20
business.  Any regular deviations from these travel policy recommendations=
=20
will be reviewed by each business unit leader.

? Air travel =01) Employees are requested to use either Travel Agency in th=
e=20
Park (TAP) or the GSS-approved preferred travel agency for your location -=
=20
all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by=
=20
GSS - or http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron, the new online travel booking=20
service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same=20
negotiated discounts.  Employees who fly in the United States should book=
=20
non-refundable coach tickets, which are typically 65 percent less than=20
refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a $100 fee. =
=20
For this reason, we strongly encourage all employees to purchase=20
non-refundable domestic coach tickets when possible.

? Lodging =01) GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel=
=20
chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate each business unit=01,s=20
individual hotel policy.  We recommend that you use Enron=01,s list of pref=
erred=20
hotels to select accommodations that are in line with your business unit=01=
,s=20
policies.  You can view the list at http://travel.enron.com.

? Car rental services =01) When renting a car for business travel, employee=
s=20
should use our preferred car rental agencies =01) National (U.S. and Canada=
) and=20
Alamo (U.S.)- since the agreements we have negotiated are intended to prote=
ct=20
you and Enron through the insurance coverage in our contract.  Visit=20
http://travel.enron.com for details and updates to services available outsi=
de=20
the U.S.

? Off-site meetings =01) All domestic-U.S. off-site meetings and events wit=
h=20
more than 10 people should be coordinated through GSS, which will negotiate=
=20
preferred rates for Enron.  They can be reached at (713) 646-8311.

Because there are differences between business units and offices, each=20
business unit leader will follow up this memo with a communication further=
=20
elaborating on these policies as they apply to their business unit.

Each of us has a responsibility to make sure we do our part to ensure Enron=
=20
retains its competitive edge.  These recommendations are some basic, sensib=
le=20
actions we can take company-wide, but it is up to every employee to look fo=
r=20
cost saving measures and do what makes sense in your daily activities.  If=
=20
you have an idea or a suggestion you would like to share with us, please=20

I am in complete agreement with the below (except I think the applause for 
our demise was, unfortunately, rather more aggressive!!). This was my first 
exposure to the non-European Steel players and found myself quite amazed at 
the few number of "public" advocates that we had at the conference in 
consideration of what we are offering.  The one-on-one contact with the 
attendees was completely the opposite.  We talked with a broad and numerous 
set of people who, coming to the booth as sceptics (they think that were are 
in the market just to grab the physical business), left with cards in hand 
and future risk management meetings in mind.  Big buyers (eg GE, Emerson) and 
consultants (eg Accenture, McK, etc) were particularly receptive and should 
be courted as public advocates for what we are doing.

Subject: Steel Stradegies Conference - NYC 06/20/01

Yesterday, during the Panel V discussion, "Why Have Steel Middlemen Gone From 
The Most Threatened To Best Positioned", we got some direct feedback on the 
perception of Enron in the marketplace. The participants were, Fred Lamesh 
CEO of Trademarked Inc., Michael Siegel, CEO of Olympic Steel, Bud Siegel, 
CEO of Russell Metals, and Wilfred von Bulow, CEO of Ferrostaal Inc.; the 
moderator was Peter Marcus, Managing Partners of World Steel Dynamics. Each 
participant gave a brief speech about their respective companies which was 
followed by a Q&A session. The first mention of Enron was during Michael 
Siegal's speech in which he mentioned that Olympic Steel had "sold material 
to Enron" and that "Enron has recognized that steel is a commodity and for 
many countries represents currency."  Michael was clearly proud of his 
transactions with Enron and agreed with our view of steel as a commodity.
The real feedback came during the Q&A. Peter Marcus posted the following 
question to the panelists. "What about Enron? With their plan of entering the 
market with a number of hubs across the country, stocking material, with 
large scale distribution on a "spot" basis. Will this business model work? Do 
they offer any real value or not?" 
Following are the respective responses as best I can reiterate from my notes 
( please don't quote me on this):
Fred Lamesh, TradeArbed: "The concept is too new to make a judgment yet on 
credibility. Enron has certainly been successful in the past and should not 
be discounted. I question their ability to procure material at competitive 
enough levels to make this a profitable venture but there may be some value 
in their delivery of financial instruments."
Michael Siegal, Olympic Steel: "Enron certainly has the financial means to 
withstand a "break even" business to support their financial instruments. At 
this point, we view them as just another entity in the market and until we 
can evaluate their performance, it is difficult to determine value. I am 
concerned though that they will prop up under capitalized distributors and 
allow them to operate despite mismanagement. One interesting and unique 
concept that they are trying to bring to the industry though is the idea that 
a contract is a contract, with liquidated damages for non performance. That 
would certainly be change (sporadic laughter among the crowd)."
Bud Siegel, Russell Metals: "I addressed the Enron question last night during 
dinner and was told that I was abusive to the young lady from Enron (Tammy, I 
later understood that you had a less than cordial conversation with Bud the 
previous evening). I am calling Enron the "Hunts of the steel business" with 
their idea of buying up the market. The whole concept is like Swiss cheese. 
You can not put up depots, buy from steel mills, and expect to sell the same 
steel to distributors cheaper than the mills themselves. The logistical 
expenses alone guarantee failure. You can not be everything to everyone. 
Considering the current state of under financing in this industry, they will 
inevitably end up financing bankrupt people and take credit hits. Without 
immediate success, Enron has been known to exist markets quickly in the past, 
and I believe they will be gone within the year."(some sporadic applause)   
Wilfried von Bulow, Ferrostaal: "Right now they are just another additional 
player in the market. They will certainly have an impact but it would not be 
pragmatic to make a judgment yet on their ability to succeed. Let's watch it 
and see if there is any value to what they are trying to bring to the market."
It appears to me that the focus on Enron in the market right now continues to 
be more on the physical aspects of what we are doing and not enough emphasis 
or credibility is being given to the financial tools we are bringing. It is 
obviously very easy to poke holes in a concept of trading large volumes of 
physical steel on a "spot" basis through the set up of physical hubs around 
the country. In the end, the only way we will be successful will be by 
bringing liquidity to our index through financial instruments. We need to 
focus more on educating customers about our financial tools, developing our 
curve, and bringing players to the market.

I would suggest that we start reporting Capital Deployed and Funds Flow 
numbers in these reports as well
as the Wholesale Group will need to take the lead in managing both.

Restructuring Today readers got this story today...

Retail market
can be opened
nationally?
---
Joe Barton thinks
it can and is
about to try
---
Once in 20 years
opportunity seen

How can the retail power market be opened in today's atmosphere?
     Joe Barton has a way and it sounds like it just might work.
     He briefed APPA members winding up the last day of the annual
meeting in Washington.   Barton implored the membership that if they
have any ideas on how to improve energy policy, this is the time to tell
policy makers or him.
     Barton sees a narrow, six-week opportunity as America is about to
revise its energy policy.
     We walked with him to his car after the speech and asked what he
means by a major energy restructuring bill.
     He referred vaguely to legislation that would improve the grid and
foster the functioning of a robust market providing for movement of
power from one place to another.
     He wants a national market with a grid that can handle it "in an
open access way -- creating all these trading markets where you have
long-term and short-term markets where you balance supply and demand
around the country.
     "States that have surplus power, through the RTO system can wheel
that power to states that need it."
     That's the wholesale market, we asked.
     Yes.
     But what about retail?
     He hopes to get into the law a provision to foster aggregation of
buyers.
     How would that work?
     "AARP," Barton said noticing our age, "could sell you power or Wal-
Mart or McDonalds or the co-ops.  You could buy your power through
them."
     How would a law provide for aggregation?
     "It would be in the federal legislation that it would be
permitted," he replied.
     But what about Nebraska where there are only munis?
     "You've got to work through that and see if you get some kind of
grandfather or state opt-out provision.  It's possible that you give
states the right to opt out.  But over time those states will want to
opt in," he added.
     "That'll be a debate we'll have when we get into the bill.  You're
not supposed to ask that tough a question this early in the process," he
reminded with a smile.
     Barton is really impressed with the magnitude of the legislation
gestating in the nation's capital.
     "Everything" is up for discussion, he said, "everything.
     "There is nothing -- nothing -- that's been debated or talked about
in terms of electricity that is not on the table," Barton assured.
     "I'm not saying we're going to do it all but you have a window like
this once every 20 to 30 years.  I'm going to be damned if I'm going to
stand around and on my on volition take things off the table.
     "Now the process will automatically take a lot more controversial
items out of play.  There'll be a region or a political block -- who
knows the president might not like something.  John Dingell might not
like something.  Who knows?  But I'm not -- even before we put pen to
paper to start drafting the bill -- say `we're not going to consider
this'," Barton added.
     Is he getting signals from Dingell that he might be cooperative?
     "Yeah.  Very cooperative.  Of course, again, the proof is in the
pudding and in the details."
     Barton's in the leadership role in fostering a national energy
policy, taking the package from the vice president and guiding it
through the House.
     He's the president's energy guy from an energy state and Bush has
shown -- with the tax bill -- that he can get a program enacted.
     Barton wants something he can look back at in five, 10 and 20 years
and say "that's a good bill.  It works."
     Barton wants to make history with the Energy Policy Act of 2001.
     Barton told APPA he wants this big bill to be "national, long-term
in its impact and balanced."
     Balanced means looking at the generation component, transmission
and distribution "and in each of those areas -- this is just me.  I'm
not speaking for anyone but myself" -- he wants "to create an
environment so we have a maximum, competitive situation that's open and
fair to everybody.
     "And we're going to do that and you're going to have a lot of
competition, a lot of flexibility with a lot of choice for consumers and
a lot of choice for yourself," Barton added.
     Wait a minute.
     He's saying competition in transmission and distribution.
     We really do need to ask him what he has in mind there when the
time is right.
     We can't help but think of competition in selling pipeline capacity
in a secondary market.
     You can do that with electricity capacity to or on a local
distribution system in gas.  We're thinking aloud here.  That's not what
Barton said.
     He wants to minimize the federal role except where you actually
have to.
     That puts Barton "a little at variance with some in the Bush
Administration and some in the Congress because in the modern age
there's a natural proclivity to centralize and consolidate which in the
political arena means let Washington do it."
     Barton wants to maximize the technology component and will put into
the bill a distributed generation component.
     He's interested in negawatts, fostering cut backs in demand on a
national scale.
     "Looking out for your own interest," Barton considers to be
"democracy."
     But from time to time you have to step back and look at the
national interest, he advocated.
     "That's my job."
     Today's crisis mentality helps Congress act boldly.
     The friendliness to competitive markets in the White House
encouraged by the president's pride about the retail bill he got through
the Texas Legislature plus today's environment may be ideal for market-
minded leaders.

Gentlemen:

 Attached is the DASH for the approval of the DPR Accelerated Put 
transaction.  This partial divestiture allows us to put $11 million of our 
equity interest back to DPR Holding Company, LLC and its subsidiary, Dakota, 
LLC.  Both entities are controlled by Chris Cline.

 In addition to redeeming part of our equity interest, the deal provides us 
900,000 tons of coal priced below market, an option which could lead to a 
very profitable synfuel project, and the potential for more marketing fees 
from other Cline entities.

 The DASH has been approved and signed by RAC and JEDI II, and is now 
awaiting Mark Haedicke's review and approval.  I wanted to give you the 
opportunity to review the DASH and become familiar with the provisions of the 
deal.

 If you have any questions on the transaction, feel free to contact me at 
(412) 490-9048.  Others familiar with the deal are Mike Beyer, George 
McClellan, and Wayne Gresham.

 Thank you.

  Bill Giuliani

Subject: Crisis in Enron Japan

Dear top management,

I know how dangerous if I use my real name so please forgive me to
use this free email.
I studied Enron for a long time before there is a branch in Tokyo.
How glad when I received the offer from Enron Japan! I believe my life must
have been changed to a new chapter.

But now... I'm so disppointed with enron Japan's poor management.
We local staff think Joe and other "experts" are too young to manage
this company. Forgive my impolite, EJ is really like a kindergarden!

In order not to waste your time,I conclude some points here:

1. Joe's poor management not only makes everything confused but also
makes local staff fears. He is so cold and imprudent that Japanese is
difficult to communicate with him. I know he is from Harvard,but that
doesn't
mean he is human,he is sensitive.

2. It's very obvious that Joe conflicted with Jonathan and now we don't
think he works well with Jeremy. We want to know why you top management
always make such kind of combination. Joe only trusts the people he worked
together in Norway and Australia. He has strong discrimination with Jonathan
and Jeremy's people,also has strong discimination with local staff.

3. Enron Metal is in the same office with us but like a completely different
company. No any communication between Enron Japan and Enron metal.The same
situation can be seen with E-power.Japanese mass media are suprised why
Enron
set up two companies in Japan. E-power is enough!!! Look at GE, why they
succeed
the business in Asia. They make joint venture company first. Until they are
convinced they can succeed, they open branch. Learn from GE!

4. The experts from overseas countries are really cheeky,they are not modest
to hear local staff's opinions but just push their methods to us. We can't
see any
democracy in this company!! If you want to succed your business,you should
also
hear some opposite ideas.You shouldn't alianate the people who say different
things! We don't need young associate! Let them go home!!

5. We don't need young experts because Japanese clients won't do business
if the counterparty is too young. All of the young experts should go home.
They are wasting enron's money!! To send young experts here doesn't match
Japanese culture.


All of these are true. I love Enron and want to see Enron Japan become a
comfortable and profitable place to work.

Thanks&regards
Sato
