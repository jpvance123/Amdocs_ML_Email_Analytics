Stacy,

Mark Taylor would like an email for your approval of both product types.  The descriptions are the same but the GTC's are different.  The 1 month or less product type uses the Spot GTC and the > 1 month product uses the firm GTC.  Please respond to Mark and copy me with your approval.  Sorry for the inconvenience.  Also, Susan Musch in Tax would like to revise the Phy GTC with new tax language.  Once I hear from her I will forward you the change.

Mark,

Whether or not the mid-month to mid-month deals are likely, you should probably ask Scott Moncrieff or Joe King to answer that question.

I was just suggesting the possibility...  I do like the additional language that covers deals shorter than one month

"Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period; provided that, if the term of the Transaction is less than one calendar month, the Determination Period shall be the term of the Transaction."

Perhaps we should proceed with the current Product Description and worry about the mid-month to mid-month description if/when we need it.

Homer

Subject:	Re: Tanker Freight Long Description   

Homer - 

The problem with the language you suggest is that it will be triggered by any term that is longer than a month.  As far as I know, we have never had a product that went from mid-month to mid-month.  Is that a real issue for us here?  We have language in a few products already that takes care of the second issue (deals shorter than one month):

Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period; provided that, if the term of the Transaction is less than one calendar month, the Determination Period shall be the term of the Transaction.

In some cases (e.g. power swaps), when the deal is for less than a month the payment dates are modified to fall at the beginning of the following month (rather than 5 days after the floating price is determinable).  That is a commercial call.  Just let me know how you want to handle that issue.

If mid-month to mid-month deals are likely, let me know and I will come up with alternative language.

Mark

Mark,

Looks good.  The product description looks fine for copying the shipping products that Scott Moncrieff is trading now in London.

I'm a little concerned about the line: "Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period"...

Is it flexible enough in changing determination periods from mid-month to mid-month?
As in June 15 to July 14 to represent a month?  Or will that just be another Long Description that we would have to draft for another product type?

Also, what if we wanted to break up the determination periods into smaller increments than one month?  
Let us say a 1-week or 2-week period instead of a full month.

May be something like:
"Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period unless otherwise specified by the Effective Dates"

That's my two cents,
Homer

Here are the final Long Form Descriptions for the remaining regions (NSW, 
QLD, SA).

The term of the Swaps that will initially be offered via EOL has yet to be 
decided, but I assume we can set those in the Product Manager when we create

Rob,

Please review the attached long description for the spread product you've requested.  Additionally, please confirm that the unit of measure will be barrels per month and that you understand the functionality of the product (i.e. one product on the website, two swap transactions once hit/lifted).  Let me know what you think.

Please approve!  Dale has to make one revision to the product (the delivery 
location field is n/a to an ICAP product -- I had populated the field with 
some text from the product description, but Dave Forester doesn't like this 
approach.  So I have revised the product so that the delivery location field 
states that no delivery location is specified for the product.  

I'm not sure if the product will be rerouted for your approval, but if it is, 
I've signed off on the revised version.

Leslie

Melba, I do not have "Test Applications" in my Start/Programs menu.  My only comment is that I would clarify the delivery point as Empress, Alberta rather than simply Empress.  Otherwise, the product descriptions look fine.

Scott,

I have read all the mails from Paul and his questions relate to the issue which Matthias brought up regarding if the Flat rate changes within a period would two flat rates be used etc etc.  The answer is no the last Flat Rate shall be used for the whole Determination Period.

I have attached the latest wording from legal for BITR 9 and made the appropriate changes highlighted in red, Singapore's amendment is shown in respect to our previous request in blue. 

Please let me know if you approve of the final wording so Arfan can send this to the lawyers for their final approval which hopefully after all this time would mean that  EOL can post BITR 9 & 11 and IITRA on EOL for Monday 16th July.  

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Joe King is in Norway all this week so he probably hasn't seem the e-mails.  You might try to reach Scott Moncrieff in London at 830-37488.
If you can't get a hold of him, then we should just proceed.

Mark,

Whether or not the mid-month to mid-month deals are likely, you should probably ask Scott Moncrieff or Joe King to answer that question.

I was just suggesting the possibility...  I do like the additional language that covers deals shorter than one month

"Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period; provided that, if the term of the Transaction is less than one calendar month, the Determination Period shall be the term of the Transaction."

Perhaps we should proceed with the current Product Description and worry about the mid-month to mid-month description if/when we need it.

Subject:	Re: Tanker Freight Long Description   

Homer - 

The problem with the language you suggest is that it will be triggered by any term that is longer than a month.  As far as I know, we have never had a product that went from mid-month to mid-month.  Is that a real issue for us here?  We have language in a few products already that takes care of the second issue (deals shorter than one month):

Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period; provided that, if the term of the Transaction is less than one calendar month, the Determination Period shall be the term of the Transaction.

In some cases (e.g. power swaps), when the deal is for less than a month the payment dates are modified to fall at the beginning of the following month (rather than 5 days after the floating price is determinable).  That is a commercial call.  Just let me know how you want to handle that issue.

If mid-month to mid-month deals are likely, let me know and I will come up with alternative language.

Mark

Mark,

Looks good.  The product description looks fine for copying the shipping products that Scott Moncrieff is trading now in London.

I'm a little concerned about the line: "Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period"...

Is it flexible enough in changing determination periods from mid-month to mid-month?
As in June 15 to July 14 to represent a month?  Or will that just be another Long Description that we would have to draft for another product type?

Also, what if we wanted to break up the determination periods into smaller increments than one month?  
Let us say a 1-week or 2-week period instead of a full month.

May be something like:
"Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period unless otherwise specified by the Effective Dates"

That's my two cents,
Homer

Importance:	High

Chris,

I've reviewed the DLK description you sent me and have revised it to clear up confusion over the meaning of EXW in the Delivery Terms section.  The elaboration of the Incoterm EXW showed that we really mean to use the FCA delivery term, due to Seller's retaining load out responsibility.  

The other substantive change made was to remove the reference to Delivery Location as being anywhere other than Seller's facilities in Chicago or Atlanta.  Because Buyer has full responsibility for carriage of the Commodity under either EXW or FCA, Seller should not care anything about the "Delivery Location"; Seller is assuming no obligation to delivery anywhere other than to a truck or rail car that Buyer has caused to be brought onto Seller's premises.  

There is a clean and marked copy of the DLK description for your review.  Please call with any questions.

Steve Van Hooser

Attached please find the revised US Fin Pwr Spread.  I have hilighted the language that provides that the fixed price for the second transaction will be the midpoint of the bid and offer prices for physical power.  Simply delete the hilighted language if the traders decide to base the fixed price on the midpoint of the financial swap instead.

Note that I made changes to the index language as well as numerous changes to the product long description itself.

Steve reviewed and offered comments; changes in bold:

The Index for a Determination Period shall be the average of the daily 
settlement prices on the OM London 
Exchange (formerly the OMLX exchange) of the Pulpex Futures Contract for 
Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft 
(the "Futures Contract") for each day on which the OM London Exchange is open 
(a "Trading Day") 
during the Determination Period. The Futures Contract will be the contract 
with the earliest expiration date, except 
on those days that fall within 10 Trading Days before that expiration date, 
in which case the next successive 
Futures Contract price shall be used.

Sara and Mark:

Please look over the attached product description and one of the index 
descriptions and let me know if you have any comments.  



I suggest revising the Financial Power Swap Product as follows:


A US Power financial Swap Transaction with Enron North America Corp., under 
which the Seller 
pays a Floating Price and the Buyer pays the price submitted by Counterparty 
on the website 
(the Fixed Price) in each case in respect of the Notional Quantity per 
Determination Period.  Each 
calendar month during the term of the Transaction or the term of the 
Transaction if it is less than a month will be a Determination Period. The 
Notional 
Quantity per Determination Period shall be the volume for the relevant 
Determination Period 
(calculated using the volume submitted by Counterparty via EnronOnline). The 
Payment Date(s) 
will be 5 business days after the Floating Price is determinable. The 
Floating Price shall be the 
average of the Index for each day in the relevant Determination Period.

Attached please find a Weather Long Description, modified pursuant to our 
conversation this morning.
I will change the CDD Product Typre description as well. Also, last week we 
changed the reference to the price quote to remove reference to "per unit of 
volume".

Please review and offer approval/comments.






David:

For your ease of reference, bolding represents additional language; italics 
represents changes.

Should I be changing the Norway and UK components as well, or will that be 
done by PCG London? 
(I am more than happy to do it.)

Mark,

The following is a new  power demand index requested by Claudio Ribeiro.  
Please let me know if it looks OK for the Website.

A US Power Demand Financial Swap Transaction with Enron North America Corp., 
under which the Seller is obliged to pay the Payment Amount to the Buyer 
where the Floating Amount is above the Fixed Amount, or where the Buyer is 
obliged to pay the Payment Amount to the Seller where the Floating Amount is 
below the Fixed Amount.  The Fixed Amount is the amount in Megawatts 
submitted in the "price" field by Counterparty via the Website. The Notional 
Amount is the product of the quantity submitted by Counterparty via the 
Website and the Pay Unit. The Payment Amount is the product of (i) the 
Notional Amount and (ii) the absolute value of the difference between the 
Floating Amount and the Fixed Amount.  The Payment Amount will be payable on 
or before ten (10) business days after the Floating Amount for the 
Determination Period is determinable.
The Determination Period is from and including the Effective Date of 04 Jun 
2001 (Initial Date) to and including the Termination Date of 08 Jun 2001 (End 
Date).
The Floating Amount shall be the arithmetic average of the hourly PJM loads 
for Peak hours on each Delivery Day during the Determination Period. The 
Floating Amount shall be calculated utilizing the hourly integrated loads 
published by PJM Interconnection, LLC ("PJM") on its official web site 
currently located at ftp://www.pjm.com/pub/account/loadhryr/index.html, or 
any successor thereto, under the heading "PJM Hourly Load Data".
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the 
Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be megawatts and 
the quantity shown shall be in total MWs.
The transaction is for on-peak ("Peak") hours on each Delivery Day beginning 
with the hour ending 0800 (7:00 am) and concluding with the hour ending 2300 
(11:00 pm) Eastern Prevailing Time.  "Delivery Day" means a day during the 
term of the transaction that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or 
Friday, excluding any day that is a NERC holiday.
The Pay Unit is 10 USD.

Thanks,

CW

Melba is out of the office for the remainder of the week and I will be taking 
on her responsibilities.  Let me know if the following language is OK for the 
new index:

The Floating Amount shall be the arithmetic average of the hourly loads for 
Peak hours on each Delivery Day during the Calculation Period. The Floating 
Amount shall be calculated utilizing the hourly integrated loads published by 
ISO New England Inc. ("ISO-NE") on its official web site currently located at 
http://www.iso-ne.com/Historical_Data/hourly_data/2001_hourly_data.txt, or 
any successor thereto, under the heading "Load".

Melba,

the web location for NEPOOL Data is (for 2001) 
http://www.iso-ne.com/Historical_Data/hourly_data/2001_hourly_data.txt. The 
demand data is the data on the column under the name LOAD. The formulation 
for the weekly index (demand) is the same as it is in PJM.

Thanks,

Claudio

Please find attached the latest long description for the tanker freight products.  Please note that I will add this to the system this afternoon as it stands for the UK and Singapore products (changing the route details)  unless I hear otherwise so as to enable us to get everything approved and meet the live date for next Monday.

Scott,

I have read all the mails from Paul and his questions relate to the issue which Matthias brought up regarding if the Flat rate changes within a period would two flat rates be used etc etc.  The answer is no the last Flat Rate shall be used for the whole Determination Period.

I have attached the latest wording from legal for BITR 9 and made the appropriate changes highlighted in red, Singapore's amendment is shown in respect to our previous request in blue. 

Please let me know if you approve of the final wording so Arfan can send this to the lawyers for their final approval which hopefully after all this time would mean that  EOL can post BITR 9 & 11 and IITRA on EOL for Monday 16th July.  

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Regards,

Debbie

Subject: Proposed new Index



Index:  Gas Daily WAHA
Abbreviation: Waha
Sort Code: 3530


The Index for a calendar day shall be the average of the Daily Midpoint 
prices published for such calendar day under the heading "Daily Price Survey" 
in the Permian Basin Area: Tex intras, Waha area section of Gas Daily, or if 
a calendar day is not a Business Day then the price for such calendar day 
will be the average of the Common High and Common Low prices published on the 
next succeeding Business Day.

Should the word "area" after "Waha" be capitalized? It's not capitalized in 
the Gas Daily publication - so to consistent with the publication I did not 
capitalize.
On some Gas Daily products we are switching to the Gas Daily posted average - 
is this one of those?  Bob Bowen has been looking into this also. See above.
