Diana/Cara,

Attached is a letter from Mark Hackey, which I assume you have already read.  Do you have any issues related to this document that I need to address with anyone on the WSCC OC or WMIC?

Generally the letter seems pretty straight forward, it seems too bad that they hedge, even the Dec 11 implementation date.  Please let me know if there is anything we need to address in this letter,

Thanks,

Dave

Hi Marilyn - 

Thanks for the Vancouver notes.  Regarding the item on POR/PODs - since the
meeting, Mark sent out the Clarification letter of September 24 (attached)
stating we use the WSCC POR/POD acronyms until 1.7 hits the streets.  E-Tag
1.7 will use the POR/PODs that TPs have attempted to register
http://reg.tsin.com/ .  Although not part of the actual meeting, it might be
good to add a reference to the clarification letter so readers can get the
latest and greatest direction concerning POR/PODs usage.

It's been brought to my attention that we never resolved the issue of the
common scheduling time (no Freudian slip on the acronym).  The group agreed
to a PST value in July, but we wanted to survey the OC and WMIC first before
going further.  That was to be one of our topic in Vancouver.  Well....

So, I'd like to get a feel from the group: the survey leaned toward Pacific
Prevailing Time as that match up with energy products, so.. continue to go
forward with PST as in July, modify our suggestion to PPT or drop all
together and wait to see if NERC is going to come up with something.  If we
decide to go with either PST or PPT, I will get the OC Steering to help with
clarification on this as a due process item or an item that can be brought
to the OC for vote in 2002.  In addition, I would think that most would
agree that implementation if it takes affect would be favorable at the April
2002 time change, so that is my suggestion that we use, if ISAS goes forward
with the request to the OC.

Please get back with your thought by next Wednesday so I can put together
something for the upcoming OC meetings.

Please refer to EPMI tag # 27722.  On this tag I stacked transmission with different transmission providers.  The tag was implemented by each (CA)and (TP).  I recieved a call from PNM'S marketing group requesting that I cancel this implemented tag and re-submit it as 2 tags.  1 for each (TP).   It was actualy PNM's CA area and Trani group that had a problem with the tag.  PNM the marketer agreed that it would be o.k. to leave the tag since it had already been implemented and they would look into the issue further.  After speeking with Don Lacen who I believe represents PNM on the ISAS committe I was told that stacking tags with different trani providers was not industry standard and that they would prefer that I tag them seperatly in the future.  Until, an agreement is reached on this tagging process I agreed to tag seperately for each TP.  Please let me know if you know otherwise.

Here's my input - Issue #1 may be difficult to implement if we allow multiple TP's to be stacked.  I believe this requires a change to the E-tagging specification, which is not looked upon favorably even with the delay.  Currently, we deny tags that try to stack TP's because spec 1.67 does not allow it (even though some vendors Agent's allow it to go through).

Issue #2 - Seems like we may need a better solution somewhere - and I guess the debate is on.

Overall - I agree with Bob that we may not want these issues at the NERC I.S. level yet - can ISAS or WSCC OC work on these issues first and then move them forward?

Okay - our exchanges of e-mail were suppose to improve mutual understanding
and it seems to keep getting deeper as I go.

Two issues - 1) putting multiple transmission providers on the same path on
a tag (stacking of parallel providers), and 2) transmissionless interchange
(business practice #11)

Number 1 - don't we in the WSCC want the ability to have tags that can
contain multiple transmission providers on the same path?  For example PSEI,
PGE, and BPAT are all TPs offering Johnday-COB service.  There could be a
transaction that would utilize a reservation with each provider and it would
be most convenient to stack all that information in one tag.

Andy suggests the WSCC might want to come-up with an alternative, such as
one administrator TP for the whole path.  Sounds like an RTO.  

So, if we have a choice, we prefer the ability to stack providers on a tag -
yes???

Number 2 - the transmissionless interchange.  I have been suggesting that we
will continue on with our practice just using the TP that belongs to source
(or sink) as stated in BP #11.  Andy doesn't think that'll fly in 1.7.  What
really concerns me is his statement that "Under 1.7, a CA cannot exist
without a parent TP."  Funny, I always looked at it the other way around.  I
don't know what that means to SCL, CHPD, and other CAs who, up till now,
have not registered as TPs.

My example was a MIDC CA to CA transaction that has historically been at the
bus without transmission.  The participants have traditionally used their
interchange accounting systems to record these deals as scheduled
interchange with another CA.  Transmission was not taken into consideration
since the participants had owned and/or contract rights from MIDC to their
systems.  In addition, it has been an easy way to path-it-out by sinking it,
then creating separate transaction source at the same place.

I did feel that this issue shouldn't be brought to IS's attention - that we
would just work it out with our business practices.  What do you think?

My understanding is that only the LCA has ADJUST capabilities, and I do agr=
ee that if a PSE needs the tag changed (has a schedule change) that the rep=

Your last paragraph is right on man.  It just the commie business practice
that bites.

Again, my view of the world is that the transmission should be associated
with the sink control area - they are the one who takes it home.  The source
control area shouldn't have the fake transmission.

Guess part of the problem is due to CAs not registering as TPs which would
make things much more consistent.

PSEI will take NOR, SINGLEBUS, GF (if we're not looking), MIDC-MIDC, and
other creative entries for the OASIS number for MIDC-MIDC transactions.

Fellow ISASarians:

I believe our business practice #11 (or work around #11) will still be
possible under 1.7.  If so, is it worth bringing-up the Control Area Bus
Transfers subject in Andy's letter?  Do we really want to argue for
transmissionless tag in 1.7?

PacifiCorp Real-Time has recently been requested several times by PSE's to =

Since PPT changes twice a year and it does not resolve this scheduling problem, where PST would!  I recommend (PNM-CA/TP) we drop this issue until we can agree on a constant time zone standard (which we will never agree on).

It's been brought to my attention that we never resolved the issue of the 
common scheduling time (no Freudian slip on the acronym).  The group agreed 
to a PST value in July, but we wanted to survey the OC and WMIC first before 
going further.  That was to be one of our topic in Vancouver.  Well.... 

So, I'd like to get a feel from the group: the survey leaned toward Pacific 
Prevailing Time as that match up with energy products, so.. continue to go 
forward with PST as in July, modify our suggestion to PPT or drop all 
together and wait to see if NERC is going to come up with something.  If we 
decide to go with either PST or PPT, I will get the OC Steering to help with 
clarification on this as a due process item or an item that can be brought 
to the OC for vote in 2002.  In addition, I would think that most would 
agree that implementation if it takes affect would be favorable at the April 
2002 time change, so that is my suggestion that we use, if ISAS goes forward 
with the request to the OC. 

Please get back with your thought by next Wednesday so I can put together 
something for the upcoming OC meetings.

PacifiCorp is probably responsible for the onslaught of these Email's.  Mos=

 <<Comments on NECR Policy 3.doc>> This document contains narratives for
comments that Kevin Johnson (BPA-PBL) came up with while reviewing the
Official the November 2001 NERC MIC and OC meeting Policy 3 Action Item
Materials.  These comments point out  a couple of places in the WSCC
portions of Policy 3 where the specified timings need to be modified
slightly to make them consistent with all of the related time frames, as
intended by ISAS.  

 <<Appendix3A1v3-WSCC Timing Modifications.doc>> This document  contains the
specific Policy 3 redlines that I interpret as being necessary to implement
these comments.

Per Gordon Scott and Charles Yeung, we did not have to go through motions at
the NERC MIC and OC to get these changes made.  They only asked that we pass
them to ISAS for verification and support prior to NERC IS incorporating
them.

Mark Hackney --

		When I spoke with him about this, Don Lacen agreed to review
and coordinate these comments  with NERC IS.  As ISAS chair, Mark, I ask
your review of and support for these comments and Don's efforts to get them
incorporated.

If anyone has specific questions regarding these comments, please direct
them to Kevin Johnson.

Thanks -

I hope to clarify my earlier e-mail and answer your questions -

The "transmissionless" transactions that we developed business practice #11
around are CA to CA interchanges.  Historically, participants at the MIDC
would track purchases and sales of energy between each other as scheduled
interchange between their control areas.  The participants all have owned
and/or contracted transmission to/from their systems.  

When tagging came along, authoring PSEs for these MIDC deals just wanted to
do a tag with one source control area and once sink control area with no
transmission segments.  There could be a dozen marketers (thus, a dozen
title transfers) in the chain, but the tag would not indicate transmission,
just interchange between source and sink CAs (limited to CA participants at
the MIDC).  

At some point (1.5 or 1.6?) E-Tag required a tag to contain at least one
transmission segment.  The WSCC approached the IS to allow for no
transmission segments in a tag.  We were told no.  So, the business practice
of picking the source (or the sink) CA's TP to provide a MIDC-MIDC
transmission segment was adopted. 

Hope answers your question.

Bob Harshbarger

ISAS Members.

Mark Meyer, Chair of the WSCC Operations Committee, has asked me to Chair
the Interchange Scheduling and Accounting Sub-Committee for calendar years
2002 and 2003. I have accepted Mark's request and look forward to working
with all of the talented professionals that comprise the ISAS.

Mark Hackney and I have received several inquiries about the January
14-15/2002 meeting currently shown on the WSCC meeting calendar. I have
elected to reschedule the meeting to February 14-15, 2002 in Phoenix. The
meeting will be sponsored by SRP. We are currently working on the details.
We will make best efforts to provide you hotel and meeting information by no
later than January 10, 2002. We understand that this is somewhat short
notice. However, it is important that we meet prior to the implementation of
E-Tag version 1.7. 

It has become a clich? to state that our industry is going through
incredible change. That has been the case for the last 10 years. However, it
appears that much of the rubber will hit the road over the next 2 years. I
believe that ISAS can and will play an important part in this evolution. We
can help develop the scheduling and business practices that can make the new
environment work for the WSCC. I suggest that our actions should be closely
coordinated with WSCC Operations Committee, the Western Market Interface
Committee, the new Electronic Scheduling Working Group, and the NERC
Interchange Sub-Committee. 

I'll be out of the office on business most of the next few weeks. However,
I'll be checking my E-Mail and voice mail. If there are specific items that
you would like to see on the meeting agenda please let me know. The agenda
will be mailed out on January 17, 2002.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks.

Good Morning Diana,

I just spoke with Duong and we don't think it will be a huge issue for Enpower.  Here are my thoughts:

1.  Enpower stores dates & times in GMT.
2.  On each schedule strip, we identify the time zone.  Portland users usually select PPT.  Pacific Prevailing Time is smart enough to properly assign either PST or PDT depending on the date.  If the date falls on the long-day or short-day, Enpower will split the strip into 2 strips based on the time the deal flows.
3.  I am assuming that WSCC would standardize on PST.  We would just need to run a mass change SQL statement to convert all the PPT and PDT schedule strips to PST.  

Anyway, I'll be back in Portland on Friday.  Please let me know if you have any available time to discuss further.

Thanks,  David Poston

Subject:	Common Scheduling Time Zone across WSCC

There's a survey being sent around to the WSCC ISAS group regarding a standardization of time.  The circumstances surrounding this survey involve the Day Ahead Scheduling process, timely Net Interchange checkouts between adjacent Control Areas, E-Tagging timelines for submission and assessment.  It comes back to a common time element for all parties to use in the above process and the elimination of the 23 and 25 hour days on the Daylight Saving changes.  Though the times on clock would change, the scheduling times would not.  It is thought that significant time, manpower and operating expense savings can be achieved by implementing a single scheduling time.  But to achieve this, what are the costs associated with implementation.  The area's obvious to me are 1.  Existing Contracts- How to implement these on a forward basis.  2.  Future EOL confirmation processes  3.  Enpower.  

There are no apparent transition issues for Scheduling.  In fact, this will eliminate some for them.  I need to know whether or not we would support this standardization, what the estimated costs associated with this if we do or don't make the change,  and what the implementation issues would be.  I'm sure I haven't covered some, so please forward this to the appropriate people.

It's been brought to my attention that we never resolved the issue of the
common scheduling time (no Freudian slip on the acronym).  The group agreed
to a PST value in July, but we wanted to survey the OC and WMIC first before
going further.  That was to be one of our topic in Vancouver.  Well....

So, I'd like to get a feel from the group: the survey leaned toward Pacific
Prevailing Time as that match up with energy products, so.. continue to go
forward with PST as in July, modify our suggestion to PPT or drop all
together and wait to see if NERC is going to come up with something.  If we
decide to go with either PST or PPT, I will get the OC Steering to help with
clarification on this as a due process item or an item that can be brought
to the OC for vote in 2002.  In addition, I would think that most would
agree that implementation if it takes affect would be favorable at the April
2002 time change, so that is my suggestion that we use, if ISAS goes forward
with the request to the OC.

Please get back with your thought by next Wednesday so I can put together
something for the upcoming OC meetings.

All,

It is my understanding that transmission stacking was to be used when
aggregating multiple OASIS reservations from the same transmission provider
on a single tag.  The stacking of OASIS reservations in descending order of
priority works for a single xmn provider, and the tag author's use of the
descending stacking methodology can be verified by that transmission
provider.  Doesn't using multiple xmn providers eliminate this checking
mechanism?  Or is the idea of the transmission provider verifying the stack
order distasteful?

Finally, is allowing xmn stacking with multiple xmn providers the logical
extension of allowing xmn stacking with one provider?

et al:

I have a Preschedule Tag (implemented only for the day) that is raising
some eyebrows that needs to be up for discussion.

No. 14.. Business Practices- "Multiple transmission reservations or
grand fathered transmission contracts may use the "level" capability of
the e-tag.  The PSE should list their stacked transmission segments in
descending order of priority."

The reason this is causing some problems is due to the multiple
transmission providers.  All CA's and TP's approved the tag initially,
but then was rejected as a future tag.  I would propose having the
Business practice amended to allow the tag to display multiple
transmission providers.  On the original tag, the MW break-out was
clearly defined under the Reference field and also on the Comments
field.  It appears that all control areas also should be able to check
out with one another.

Two issues - 1) putting multiple transmission providers on the same path on
a tag (stacking of parallel providers), and 2) transmissionless interchange
(business practice #11)

Number 1 - don't we in the WSCC want the ability to have tags that can
contain multiple transmission providers on the same path?  For example PSEI,
PGE, and BPAT are all TPs offering Johnday-COB service.  There could be a
transaction that would utilize a reservation with each provider and it would
be most convenient to stack all that information in one tag.

Andy suggests the WSCC might want to come-up with an alternative, such as
one administrator TP for the whole path.  Sounds like an RTO.  

So, if we have a choice, we prefer the ability to stack providers on a tag -
yes???

Number 2 - the transmissionless interchange.  I have been suggesting that we
will continue on with our practice just using the TP that belongs to source
(or sink) as stated in BP #11.  Andy doesn't think that'll fly in 1.7.  What
really concerns me is his statement that "Under 1.7, a CA cannot exist
without a parent TP."  Funny, I always looked at it the other way around.  I
don't know what that means to SCL, CHPD, and other CAs who, up till now,
have not registered as TPs.

My example was a MIDC CA to CA transaction that has historically been at the
bus without transmission.  The participants have traditionally used their
interchange accounting systems to record these deals as scheduled
interchange with another CA.  Transmission was not taken into consideration
since the participants had owned and/or contract rights from MIDC to their
systems.  In addition, it has been an easy way to path-it-out by sinking it,
then creating separate transaction source at the same place.

I did feel that this issue shouldn't be brought to IS's attention - that we
would just work it out with our business practices.  What do you think?

I have to tell you more than you want to know to preface this response. 
There are 5 hydro projects in the Mid-Columbia region. These 5 projects are owned and controlled by 3 control areas - Douglas County PUD, Chelan County PUD and Grant County PUD. Some of the generation from these 5 projects has been sold on a long-term basis to several participants. I'm not familiar with the term "take away rights", but every mwh generated at these 5 projects is either used for load in the 3 control areas or it is moved away to participant's control areas. The fact that some want to represent their share of generation as being part of a "single bus" and claiming it can be moved away without naming a transmission provider does not accurately represent the transfer of energy from one control area to another. Douglas, Chelan and Grant are the only control areas at the Mid-Columbia with other adjacent control areas.

Each participant has transmission capability (either their own or purchased) to transfer their share of generation from one of our control areas to their own. These transmission paths serve one of two purposes. 1) dynamic schedules or fixed schedules to serve load or 2) transfers for sale or resale.

The "single bus" idea at the Mid-C will soon be correctly represented for 4 of the 5 projects. Chelan and Grant plan to combine their control area boundaries (for scheduling and tagging purposes only) and call it the Mid-C HUB. This HUB is registered as a TP with NERC as MHUB and will accomodate transfers of energy BETWEEN participants. All other transactions will require other transmission to move energy OUT OF the Mid-C HUB. Douglas County PUD is not part of the Mid-C HUB or MHUB.

"For transactions that occur at only one bus (i.e. no OASIS/GF transmission

first line and the words "Single Bus" in the OASIS reservation field and 
"7-F" as the Product." 

Is this practice not being practiced?  I've seen/heard that at the MID 
Columbia folks selling energy to those who have take away rights at MID C 
are have their tags denied because the tag creators are not using a "TP 
specific transmission path or designation".  It was agreed to use "Single 
Bus" in these situations to avoid the implications of transmission service 
where no transmission service was necessary from the MID C. 

If the sink control area is bringing the energy back to their system at that 
point then the sink should have it indicated that it's not a single bus for 
their transmission portion, but may be "GF" or "No reservation required" 
from the bus to the system.  But in this circumstance then the path is not 
MIDC-MIDC but MIDC-SYS.  That's my take.  Others wish to pipe in?

Certainly!  Here you go.

Diana, FYI, here is a copy of the presentation I gave yesterday.  I know you and Dave are going to handling a lot of the WSCC meeting stuff, but if you would like us to attend any (either to sit in, participate, or counsel with EI perspective), please don't hesitate to ask.  I would like to get more involved in WSCC issues, as I see where Charles and I might be able to provide a lot of value.  If nothing else, it will give me a better perspective for things as we develop them at NERC and in the ESC and OSC.  If you have any questions on just want to chat, please give me a call!

Thanks again Andy for coming out.

I think it would be  a good idea to touch base with Diana.  She along with Dave Perriono will be most infulential on this stuff going forward.

In that regard, can you email her and me a copy of your presentation from yesterday?

Subject: Portland West Desk Meeting


Charles,

Greetings from Portland.  I gave presentations to the West desk on WSCC and the IS, E-Tag 1.7, ESC business practices, OASIS Phase II, a 30-second discussion of RTOs, and the NAERO/EISB debate.  They are excited about E-Tag 1.7 (although they recognize it may be delayed), seem intrigued by frag scheduling, and shared some opinions about the WSCC/NERC power struggle, NAERO/EISB, and RTOs in general.  In summary, here is what I have learned here:

1.) Dave Perrino thinks (and I agree) that we need to coordinate better, perhaps with quarterly visits from you, me, or the two of us together.  I'm amazed at how things are out here.  We need to look at getting involved supporting the desk out here, as they are really in the beginning of the standardizing process and could probably use some of our expertise.  I think they would appreciate having access to people like us that are used to duking it out with operators over procedural details.  We may want to start attending some of the WSCC meetings as well, like the ISAS, OC, and WMIC.

2.) CAs and TPs don't know how to behave out here.  A lot of the violations we saw in early tagging (such as inconsistent application of rules depending on who was working, requiring non-standard information, etc...) are still very much problems here.  Susan/Christi: I think we want to get more involved with fighting some of these jerks, as they are really RANDOM out here (I told the schedulers to bring me issues that document when we are treated unfairly, so we can start calling tariff administrators and ask them what is going on). For example:
	a.) Some people are requiring tags for bus bar only transactions (tags exist with only title transfers, and end up with dummy transmission inserted to make it a valid tag - when they should really just be book-outs)  
	b.) Some entities simply can't meet their tagging requirements (WAPA LC's system is constantly down, and they refuse to do anything about it) - Charles: this might be a good test for the P3 Compliance templates
	c.) WSCC as a whole does not use the ADJUST feature - they force PSEs to retag everything, including curtailments (that's just silly - I have no idea how that developed)

I don't know where we want to start, or how we want to start.  It might be worth it to plant some straight-men out there from other companies and see if we can't get some of these items brought up in the IS or the TISWG, then move them forward through NERC.  Or, it might be more appropriate to deal with the entities directly as Enron, with possible intervention form the NERC MIC hotline or the FERC hotline.  Thoughts? 

3.) General thought is that regardless of what FERC wants, there will be three RTOs here for the foreseeable future.  They feel this is okay, as long as we can get standardization within the RTO.  Perino has been working on a proposal that provides standards ACROSS all 3 RTOs (essentially a standard OSS Market interface for the West), but right now, the desk would settle for 3 different RTOs with seams agreements.  Longer term goal is one RTO, but the CAISO mess may make that unachievable for a while.  Expectation is that DStar and RTO West will eventually combine (either literally or functionally), with CA-ISO off doing its own thing.

4.) General consensus seems to be that we should push for two organizations (EISBE and ESIBW, or EERC and WERC, or something).  The people out here seem to think that for several reasons:
	a.) DC Tie volumes are too low for us to be fight to have standards across them - they should be treated like seams.   If there was more volume, then it might be worth the fight, but now it's just not worth it. 
	b.) People in the West knee-jerk against NERC, and anything with NERC on it is immediately regarded with suspicion and mistrust
	c.) People in the West will have enough trouble just agreeing among themselves, not to mention with all of the Eastern entities

All in all, I think this trip has been very enlightening for both myself and the West desk.  I think we should definitely continue to work with them, and perhaps see if we can facilitate the growth of WSCC into "EISBW" (or whatever they want to call it).  I think that helping define "EISBW" might also go a long way toward eroding confidence in NERC as a standards organization and aid us in the move towards unseating them to be replaced with a more balanced organization.  While I know that way may be dangerous (i.e., if the West doesn't have to follow NERC rules, why should we?), I think that a change of this magnitude is unavoidable.  This fight has been brewing for a long time, and WSCC is probably never going to come into the NERC fold.  We might as well see if we can figure out how to use that fact to our advantage.

Folks,

Although standard scheduling in Mountain Prevailing Time makes the most
sense for Montana Power Company, majority will prevail.  Therefore, since
MPC has the ability to convert our schedules to alternate time zones for
check out (pre schedule and real time), we will attempt to accommodate the
will of the masses. I guess I'm not real clear on the desired result here.
If we are only talking about the need to check day ahead and hour ahead
schedules with adjacent CA's in a time zone other than Mountain, we do that
already.  If I'm missing the bigger picture, what's new.

	Subject:	Scheduling Time constant

	It's been brought to my attention that we never resolved the issue
of the
	common scheduling time (no Freudian slip on the acronym).  The group
agreed
	to a PST value in July, but we wanted to survey the OC and WMIC
first before
	going further.  That was to be one of our topic in Vancouver.
Well....

	So, I'd like to get a feel from the group: the survey leaned toward
Pacific
	Prevailing Time as that match up with energy products, so.. continue
to go
	forward with PST as in July, modify our suggestion to PPT or drop
all
	together and wait to see if NERC is going to come up with something.
If we
	decide to go with either PST or PPT, I will get the OC Steering to
help with
	clarification on this as a due process item or an item that can be
brought
	to the OC for vote in 2002.  In addition, I would think that most
would
	agree that implementation if it takes affect would be favorable at
the April
	2002 time change, so that is my suggestion that we use, if ISAS goes
forward
	with the request to the OC.

	Please get back with your thought by next Wednesday so I can put
together
	something for the upcoming OC meetings.

Folks,

Although standard scheduling in Mountain Prevailing Time makes the most
sense for Montana Power Company, majority will prevail.  Therefore, since
MPC has the ability to convert our schedules to alternate time zones for
check out (pre schedule and real time), we will attempt to accommodate the
will of the masses. I guess I'm not real clear on the desired result here.
If we are only talking about the need to check day ahead and hour ahead
schedules with adjacent CA's in a time zone other than Mountain, we do that
already.  If I'm missing the bigger picture, what's new.

	Subject:	Scheduling Time constant

	It's been brought to my attention that we never resolved the issue
of the
	common scheduling time (no Freudian slip on the acronym).  The group
agreed
	to a PST value in July, but we wanted to survey the OC and WMIC
first before
	going further.  That was to be one of our topic in Vancouver.
Well....

	So, I'd like to get a feel from the group: the survey leaned toward
Pacific
	Prevailing Time as that match up with energy products, so.. continue
to go
	forward with PST as in July, modify our suggestion to PPT or drop
all
	together and wait to see if NERC is going to come up with something.
If we
	decide to go with either PST or PPT, I will get the OC Steering to
help with
	clarification on this as a due process item or an item that can be
brought
	to the OC for vote in 2002.  In addition, I would think that most
would
	agree that implementation if it takes affect would be favorable at
the April
	2002 time change, so that is my suggestion that we use, if ISAS goes
forward
	with the request to the OC.

	Please get back with your thought by next Wednesday so I can put
together
	something for the upcoming OC meetings.

Mirant would like to see PPT as the permanent scheduling time for the same
reasons stated by WMIC.  The two hours a year impacted by the time change
are more than outweighed by the other 8,758 hours in the year.
