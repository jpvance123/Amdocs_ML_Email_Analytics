Dear Mr. Mark Taylor,
Thank you for allowing me to briefly talk to  you.  As indicated in our conversation, Mr. Ivan Byers (513-874-1113)  personally suggested that I call you about employment opportunities at  Enron.  Maybe you can forward this onto your Human Resources in the  Enron Energy Services Division.  
 
Again, please let me tell you a little about  myself:
I am a detailed, dependable, proactive, self-starting  Mechanical Engineer that began in research and development. I have progressively  moved into project management as a project engineer. I have enhanced these  management skills by learning new software while managing and tracking cost and  schedule of projects. I have managed small construction projects from inception  through completion on schedule and under cost. I am a past member of the Project  Management Institute (PMI) and have taken the Study Seminars so that I can take  the test to earn the Certificate PMP, Project Manager Professional. I plan to  sit for the PMP test next spring. I have excellent communication skills both up  and down the organization chart whether good or requiring immediate attention. I  am a team builder by teaching, training, and mentoring.
I look forward to hearing from you in the near  future,
Again, thank you,
Respectfully submitted,
Kelly M. Clark

Mark,
The description on this one, I feel good about.  I do not have 15 years of
field experience but do have over 10 years of project management experience.
However, item 6. INTERFACE WITH GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WHICH HAVE REGULATORY
AUTHORITY OVER THE PROJECT AND OBTAIN THE NECESSARY PERMITS. I have worked
with the State of Ohio for permits and licensing.  I know the fundamentals,
but would need some direction for the state that I would be working.
Kelly

Mark,
I know four different planning and scheduling software packages, but not
Primavera Project Planner.  PG used MS Projects after using three others.
Neither BGP nor EGC were interested in a $3000 investment for one license.
I am willing to learn Primavera.
The understanding of activitity sequencing and relationships - not a
problem.  I feel that this one is about 60%.  The only other thing missing
is that on most of my projects we did not do resource allocation using the
scheduling porgram.  Most of the projects were short.  The schedule was for
the client to know about how much down time would be required and if weekend
work would be required.
Kelly

Mark,
It has been a long time since I have actively been a purchasign agent. Some
of the terms are new "Basic knowledge of Uniform Commercial Code and General
Contract Law"  However, this doesn't mean that I can't learn in a quick
note.
Otherwise I have done this job.
Kelly

Mark,
I feel that I can do this one, though I do not have specific power plant
background, I would say that I have industrial and/or construction
experience.  I like this one.

This one I can do with no problem with my skills.  If Enron could use Star

Mark,
I miss this one because of the essential reuirements of seven to ten
years of field construction experience.  I have installed two new electric
boilers and one rebuilt gas boiler.  I understand the all of the essential
requirements but have very little HVAC backgroud.
Otherwise I feel pretty good about this one other than the seven to ten
years field experience.
Kelly
PS, down below this one says very clearly, PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE
RECRUITER OR HIRING MANAGER.

Mark,
This one would be hard pressed even though I think that I can do it.  I
don't have the minimum of eight years supervisory exerience as mentioned in
the essential requirements.

Mark,
I like this one.  Although the essential functions discusses the major
requirements, I don't believe that any one person can meet all points.  I
will need to update and learn more about item #8.  Otherwise I am a 90% fit
for this one.
