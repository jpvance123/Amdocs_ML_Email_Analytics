The attached chart summarizes the tax implications of the various options for 
choice of legal entity for financial trading in Argentina.    The chart 
addressed income taxes only.  Moving the operations to Brazil will result in 
additional transactions taxes that are not addressed  in this analysis.  As 
you can see, the tax impact of each option depends the specific set of facts 
as to how Enron is operating its trading activity.  Of particular importance 
is the concept  that the US will tax the earnings of foreign jurisdictions 
even if there are no US employees involved in the transactions to the extent 
a US affiliate of Enron is deemed to be providing substantial assistance to 
the foreign entity that is involved in the financial trading activities.  

The current structure for financial trading in Argentina is the most tax 
efficient based upon the way Enron has chosen to conduct its business.  The 
earnings are limited to a single layer of tax in the US.  To the extent that 
the Sao Paulo office develops into an operation that can fully support all 
trading activity so that there is no support from the US, we may be able to 
restructure the operations to provide more flexibility to the traders in 
South America.  Even if we shift the activity to a Brazilian entity,  the 
traders will have to follow guidelines to avoid taxation in Argentina as well.

I have forgotten, does the originator need to get credit approval if a master 
is in place?  Or does the credit dept. review the positions after the fact?

No I haven't spoken to Pat yet. I believe credit analysis has already been 
done before the ISDA was signed.
Like when we did the swap with Puerto, there was no credit done for that 
particular transaction.

Sara,
Here are the indicative terms we are looking to get three price quotes for 
from CMS.  Julian will need to get you the contact information for the 
counterparty.  We would like a letter from ENA requesting the quotes for the 
trade information specified below and an attached confirm format with the 
price, term and volumes left blank since those terms are not yet set.  Please 
let me know if you have any questions or if you need any additional 
information.  We would like to have this letter sent in the next few days and 
would like to request a response from CMS by the middle or end of next week.  
Julian can give you a more exact time frame for a response.   Please send 
Julian the draft for review and copy me.  Thanks for your help on this.  
Julian, have you spoke with Pat about the potential deal yet?  

Brent

Julian and I only have one change.  We would like to have the full text to 
the second paragraph of the Floating Price difinition included so the 
customer sees it up front.  This is the language which I pulled from the 
Central Puerto confirm:

The parties agree that the Floating Amounts payable under this Transaction 
shall be made in US Dollars, and the rate of exchange of Argentine Pesos to 
US Dollars shall be of one (1) Argentine Peso per US Dollar as set forth 
under Law 23,928, as amended, while there is free convertibility of the 
Argentine Peso and the rate of exchange therein set forth is of one (1) 
Argentine Peso per US Dollar. Otherwise, the rate of exchange between 
Argentine Pesos and US Dollars shall be calculated using the exchange rate, 
sell, for transfers abroad established by Banco Naci?n Argentina at the 
closing of the Business Day prior to that on which payment is effected. 
Argentine Peso means the lawful currency of the Republic of Argentina.


Julian is traveling to Houston tonight and will call you tomorrow to discuss 
the sending of the document to CMS.  Thanks for your help.

Brent

Attached is a chart that outlines the tax implications relating to the use of 
various entities to execute financial trades in Argentina.  We can discuss at 
our meeting this afternoon and decide how we want to present to Don.

Here is my markup based on what I think the group here can do under the 
current scenario.  Let's talk Monday to discuss the draft and who we need to 
send a final markup to to confirm the tax aspects of the guidelines.  Thanks.
