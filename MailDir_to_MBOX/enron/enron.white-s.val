I think we all decided that COB S/N and NOB S/N should become a basis point 
unto themselves.  Remapping the S/N  has not been thoroughly explored 
regarding implications to existing deals and has not been re-mapped in table 
edit nor has a basis point been created.  Currently COB S/N and COB N/S = R8; 
and NOB S/N = Basis Pt #22 which is also what NOB N/S is mapped as.  We'll 
probably only appreciate the revaluation on a shoulder month basis, but I 
believe it is material.

Subject: Re: adding new books/desks/counterparties in West Portfolio

Hi Min Zheng and Norman:

In the past couple of weeks you have been working on adding three new books 
(Short-term west rockies, Short-term west services, and Long-term west 
options) for the west.  Yesterday we entered/moved our exotic deal (deal # 
13982.3, which was originally in Short-term Southwest book) into the new 
Short-term west rockies book and we are seeing a couple of problems:

(1) It seems that in DprAutomation the Short-term west rockies book was named 
as "ST-WROCK", rather than "ST-WR" (i.e. the book's/roll's name in 
M:\common\power\Postion\Dpr\2001\0102).  Therefore, last night and this 
morning we had to temparily changed the roll's name to ST-WROCK in order to 
allow DprAutomation to run through the roll to bring in P&L/PCS/PID data.  
(After DprAutomation was done running, we then changed it back to ST-WR so we 
can link the roll to the "pwrdpr" file).  

=> We need DprAutomation to use "ST-WR" for Short-term west rockies book so 
we won't have to change the file name everytime we run DprAutomation.

(2) As mentioned earlier, yeterday deal #13982.3 's desk was changed from 
ST-SW to Short-term west rockies in the Exotic book.  Although we officialize 
the Exotic book (post id 14061), Nancy Hernandez in Risk Management (Houston) 
found that they could not see the Short-term west rockies book officialized 
in Exotic.  

=> I am not sure if this is due to the same problem as in (1) or something 
else.  We need the new Short-term west rockies book set up right so it can be 
officialized in the Exotic book in order for the Risk Control Group in 
Houston to see/monitor it.

Please help us look at the above issues.  Let me know if I can provide more 
useful information.

(For Nancy:  I spoke with Valarie and there is nothing we know of other than 
deal #13982.3 that was in the ST-SW book in Exotic book.  Since we moved the 
deal to Short-term west rockies book last night, it should be normal to see 
nothing remaining in the ST-SW book.)

Thanks,
Fran

Subject: adding new books/desks/counterparties in West Portfolio

Hi guys:  

I just wanted to touch base with you on how we are doing on the IT side 
regarding the 3 new books that West Power is establishing (* please refer to 
the email attached from Val sent on 2/5/2001).  

Today, we will be creating the three new desks/books (ST West Services, ST 
West Rockies, and LT West Options).  Would you please help us set up these 
three new desks/books in "West tot belden2".  The path to the file is 
M:\power2\Curve\New_sys\Data.  Specifically, when you open the file and go to 
"Peak", "Off-Peak", "Peak-By Region", and "Off-Peak-By Region" tabs, you will 
see pivot tables/columns which can be manupulated to get positions in our 
existing desks/books (eg. LT-NW, LT-SW, etc).  We need ST West Services, ST 
West Rockies, and LT West Options to be included in these tabs under seperate 
columns, too.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Fran

Hello all.   I'm not sure if I've included too few people or too many, but 
you can let me know if I've left someone off the list or have included 
someone unnecessarily.  

We're busy up here in Portland adding new desks...these new desks  will need 
to mapped through all of the Enpower reports/calcs, DPR, adhoc, MTM97, etc.

There are several of you that I will need to work with after the books are 
set up, but I think this gets us through the initial push.  Attached is the 
primary information on the new books.  Please email me or call if there are 
any questions.

I'd like to have the setup completed by Wednesday, Feb. 07, if possible.

Thanks!

I've tested the "schedule" version of forward obs.  It seems to be working 
well.  

The wish list might include a summary page to show the desks net 0. And it 
could use a default that pulls all the west desks when the West portfolio is 
clicked, while retaining the flexibility of overriding the west default to 
choose individual desks - HOWEVER - it does work fine the way it is.

Please release this to production and let Fran Chang, Heather Dunton, 
Samantha Law and Diana Scholtes know when it is released.  Thanks!

I removed the mtm on this deal as was discussed today in our 8:30 meeting 
because the deal is Unit Contigent.  Willamette is currently included on our 
Global Standards West tab "Comments on Services Deals".

We have deals 470788, STSW
146517, LTNW
205218, LTWTRANS
426855 LTSW

which are transmission deals.  The correlation for these are contained in the 
West Correlation file in M/power2/region.  The correlation for these delivery 
points and basis points don't match what Houston's RAROC  office has. 

Please review the attached spread sheet and email me the correlation you want 
to use for valuing the tranny deals.  As soon as we agree on the correlation 
and change them in West Correlation and/or RAROC, I'll re-run the mini-books, 
and we can release the deals into mark to market as we want.

(Matt's correlation have already been reviewed but not yet changed, you're 
done Matt.)

Please let me know if you have any questions or points of discussion.  If you 
could respond by Monday, Feb 12, that'd be good.  Thanks!

Dear Valarie and Fran:

  I followed up with Nancy regarding  EPMI-ST-WROCK.  Based on her response, 
the name won't be changed to EPMI-ST-WR but a new book called EPMI-ST-SW-EXT 
will be added.  Do you plan to use that one in the future?  Please let us 
know so that we can adjust other things accordingly.  Thanks.

- Zhiyun

Zhiyun:

We actually can't change the name of books, so we had to create a new book on 
the RisktRAC side called EPMI-ST-WR-EXT.  However to my knowledge I think 
they are still officializing the EPMI-ST-SW-EXT book.

Regarding the list below, I will let you now later today if this will work 
for us.

Thanks for your help.


Nancy

Deal # 539968 legs one and two is presently in the "killed" status.  John 
will let one or all of you know, preferably by email, when you should 
reactivate the deal.  You may have to modify the start date and the deal 
date.  The deal date should match the date the EEI was signed.  And March 8th 
(the start date) will have come and gone by the time (if ) the contract is 
finalized.  

John (mid market) will take origination on this deal.  I believe his orig. 
that will come out of the LTNW book is going to be .75 per mwh.  Please 
confirm the amount with John.  

Also, please connect with Chris Foster, as I believe the orig. will be held 
until the end of March, and then Chris will provide Risk with a comprehensive 
list of all the mid-market origination that needs to be granted from the 
power books, as he did in Feb.
