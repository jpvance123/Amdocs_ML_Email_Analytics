EDF is concerned because they are worried about the number of positions they are taking on for Enron.  They want to make an additional margin call of $45 million which ENE is not willing to post (true reason: corporate liquidity issues.) According to our broker agreement with EDF, EDF is not allowed to request more margin than the NYMEX requires so we refused on that basis.  EDF may want to reduce the positions they are holding based on their perceived risk of ENE.  Ira Polk, the CFO of EDF Man said the best person to talk to is Marty Timmonds.  I would not call him up and volunteer to move positions but if he calls you and wants to do so, the moving of positions was agreed to as one way to reduce EDF Man's risk without ENE posting additional cash margin.

Sarah , 

What I was remembering was the front months exposures we had at EDF MAN.
	Prior to moves                After
DEC	-2,003			 1,967
JAN	10,502			-1,588
FEB	 1,338			   552
MAR	-7,013			   188
APR	 5,831			     33

the over all position before the move was 1,240 and as of yesterday it is 4,205.

Let me know what the concerns are at EDF MAN and the request that they are making.
We can shift some positions around if the have levels by months that they want us to stay under.

ENE is in a severe liquidity crisis.  Even if EDF makes mistakes we have to be careful how we treat them because Enron's cash position is very precarious.  It's good to insist that EDF give us what's owed especially since they seem to be wrong in this case but as far as lines of credit go, ENE is in a much worse position than ever before.  

I am going to get a guarantee to Fimat today from Enron Corp with respect to ENA trades.  We have never had to do this before but if I do not get it Fimat will keep their trade line at $11 million.  Soc Gen (extends credit under Fimat line) is being a big pain but having spoken to our bank people we have no choice but to be grateful we are getting credit these days.  

Please keep this bad cash/credit situation confidential.

Hi Dutch,
 
Yes, I would think this is possible because the overall margin excess is $24,296,123.00.  Unfortunately, I don't see any "breakdowns" on the numbers.
 
Hope this helps!

Hi Dutch,
 
You are correct, this is the related master number.  I would guess that by 9:30 ish Frank should have his numbers finalized, as my report is complete and ready for him to load.
 
I have not been forecasting EDF's number with treasury....if you believe that they will be sending this amount, please let me know so that I may inform treasury.
 
Thanks!

Per our statement from EDF Man today, it appears that we have excess on our account of $9,535,870.00.  Upon speaking to Paul at EDF Man, he told me that no money would be transfered.  He said that someone in their office was speaking to Marty Timmins in our office..???  Have either of you heard anything regarding the wire for today?  
 
I thank you for your help in this matter.

Hi again!
 
I'm pretty sure that the commissions are included on statements and charge to us daily.  Therefore, the numbers that we are confirming as either excess or margin call, is inclusive of the fees.  I believe Jason Fisher would have the exact amount of the fees.  I know this question has been proposed several times and I've always refered them directly to Jason, and I'm assuming that he was able to help as I never heard back from anyone.
 
I hope I'm leading you in the correct direction.  If not, please let me know so that I too may be aware.
 
Thanks!

Subject:	(01-366) Introduction of EFS Trading in Natural Gas

Notice # 01-366
October 31, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division members
All NYMEX Division cleating members

FROM:
J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:
Introduction of EFS Trading in Natural Gas



The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., will begin offering tomorrow
exchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions in the first step of its
plans to offer over clearing services to the over-the-counter (OTC) natural
gas market.

This plan will also include the introduction of large order execution in the
natural gas futures market and electronic trading of cleared natural gas
swaps and basis contracts.

We are delighted that we were able to expedite the introduction of this
instrument as the current climate in the natural gas market has served to
reinforce the necessity of credit intermediation.  The liquidity of our
market, combined with a clearinghouse that has half billion dollars
available to participants on each of the Exchange divisions through each
guarantee fund and the respective clearing members, put us in a unique
position to offer these services.

In addition, natural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reached the
equivalent of approximately 230 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and the
notional value of last year's transactions Exchange-wide totaled $3
trillion, or $14 billion per day.

EFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical
(EFP) transactions.  Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate the
execution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures
transaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The
transaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market
quantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities
and will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the
underlying futures contract.  EFS transactions will be permitted to
liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the two
parties involved in the transaction.  The Exchange will charge $10 per side
for each EFS transaction.  The clearing member representing each party will
be responsible to notify the Exchange of the amount and type of futures
contracts involved, the price at which the futures transaction should be
cleared, and the identity of the parties involved.

Forward Looking and Cautionary Statements
The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has attempted, wherever possible, to
make statements in good faith , as of the date of this release, by using
words such as anticipate, believes, expects, and words and terms of similar
substance in connection with any discussion of its present and future
operations within the industry. Any forward-looking statements made by, or
on behalf of the Exchange, involve a number of risks, trends, uncertainties,
and other factors which may cause actual results to differ materially,
including; the Exchange=s receipt of the necessary Commodity Futures Trading
Commission approval; timely performance and cooperative effort of exchange
partners; and changes in financial or business conditions at the Exchange.

November 30, 2001
Notice No. 01-411

TO:		NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS AND MEMBER FIRMS
		NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS

FROM:		J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:	NEW NYMEX LARGE ORDER EXECUTION RULE FOR NATURAL GAS FUTURES
____________________________________________________________________________
_____

Yesterday, the Exchange distributed Notice to Members No. 01-411, which
summarized a new large order execution (LOX) that begins today in the first
two months of the natural gas futures contract.  As an informational
follow-up to yesterday's notice, this notice includes the text of the new
LOX rule.

				NEW NYMEX RULE 6.58

Rule 6.58.	LARGE LOT TRADING OF FUTURES CONTRACTS (PILOT PROGAM)

A Floor Member may buy or sell a large lot quantity of futures contracts at
or above the minimum amount specified below at a single price on an all or
none basis, provided that each such transaction is conducted on the Exchange
trading floor in accordance with the large order execution ("LOX")
procedures specified in this rule.

(A) Eligible Futures Contract and Minimum LOX Transaction Size.  LOX
transactions may be effected only for transactions in the following NYMEX
Division futures contracts and for no less than the following minimum LOX
transaction quantities:

			Futures Contract 		Contract Months
Minimum LOX Transaction Size

			Natural Gas			1st and 2nd nearby
250
	(Six-Month Pilot Program)

(B) Eligible Orders.  A member may not execute any order by means of a LOX
transaction unless the LOX bid or Offer price is the best price available to
satisfy the terms of the order or unless the order includes specific
instructions to execute a LOX transaction.

(C) Request for Quote.  To make a request for quote (RFQ) for a LOX
transaction, an initiating Floor Member (Initiating Member) will announce an
interest in executing a LOX transaction either by requesting a LOX Bid or
Offer or both, from a specified location in the ring.  In addition, the
Initiating Member must specify to the ring the total quantity and contract
month of the RFQ.  All terms of the RFQ including the identity of the
Initiating Member will be recorded by the LOX Book Holder (LBH).  In any
case that a LOX RFQ results in a response deemed by the LBH to be
reasonable, the Initiating Member will incur RFQ fees, regardless of whether
or not that Floor Member executes a trade.

There shall be only one active RFQ for a contract month at a time.

The maximum quantity allowed for a LOX RFQ is 5,000 contracts.

(D) Bids and Offers in Response to a LOX RFQ. Any Floor Member that has bid
and/or offered the best price in response to the LOX RFQ for the full
quantity stated in the LOX RFQ and has been recognized by the LBH as making
a reasonable bid or offer will be the Initial Respondent.  Any Floor Member
responding to a LOX RFQ must indicate that the responding LOX bid or LOX
offer is in response to such RFQ (LOX Bid or Offer).  Once a LOX Bid and/or
Offer has been made and deemed by the LBH to be an acceptable bid and/or
offer, such bid or offer will be recorded by the LBH and will be active for
30 seconds from the time it has been recognized by the LBH or until it has
been expressly withdrawn, with acknowledgement from the LBH, by the Floor
Member making such bid or offer.  All LOX bids and offers must be quoted in
half cent or full cent increments.

(1) LOX Bids and Offers Outside Non-LOX Spread. A LOX Bid (Offer) may be at
or above (below) the instant bid (offer) for non-LOX trading being bid or
offered in the ring for that futures contract month.

(2) Aggregation of Orders by Brokers. Floor Members acting as brokers may
bundle limit orders to bid and/or offer in response to the LOX RFQ.  If the
total of the orders is less than the requested amount, the responding broker
can trade for his own account or an account which he controls, the
difference between the requested amount and the total of the orders.  In the
event that a broker bundles limit orders in connection with a LOX execution,
all bundled limited orders must receive the LOX execution price.

(3) Aggregation by Floor Members Trading for Proprietary Accounts.  In
response to a LOX RFQ, Floor Members trading for their proprietary accounts
may join together in bidding and/or offering for the full quantity of the
LOX RFQ.  Such proprietary accounts either may be a personal account in the
case of an individual member or a house proprietary account in the case of a
Member Firm or Clearing Member with a representative on the Trading Floor.

(4) Secondary Trading Right for Proprietary Accounts.  In response to a LOX
RFQ, only a Floor Member trading for his proprietary account, or for
proprietary accounts joined together as per section (D)(3) of this rule, may
bid and/or offer for a portion of the LOX RFQ, provided, however, that such
quantity bid and/or offered must be for an amount no less than the Minimum
LOX Transaction Size and that such bid and/or offer can only be submitted if
an Initial Respondent has been identified by the LBH and that Initial
Respondent is a Floor Member acting as a broker.  This right will be known
as a Secondary Trading Right.

In order to exercise the Secondary Trading Right, each Member must state
his/her intentions to the LBH.  For purposes of the Secondary Trading Right,
Floor Members trading for their proprietary trading accounts may exercise
this right by joining a bid or offer at any time prior to execution of the
LOX transaction and will be entitled to an aggregate amount of up to 50% of
the quantity stated in the RFQ.

When a Floor Member combines customer orders with proprietary business and
is recognized as the Initial Respondent, any reduction in the ultimate
allocation that results from an exercise of a Secondary Trading Right will
result in fills first allocated to the customer(s) with any remainder to the
Floor Member.  In addition, if, as the result of such an exercise, a broker
does not have a quantity sufficient to fill each of the orders that were
aggregated, the broker shall allocate fills according to the following
requirements:

a)	the fills shall be allocated pursuant to a predetermined allocation
methodology made available to the customers prior to the execution;
b)	the allocation shall be made as soon as practicable after the
transaction is executed;
c)	the allocation shall be fair and equitable and no account or group
of accounts may receive consistently favorable or unfavorable treatment;
d)	the allocation methodology shall be sufficiently objective and
specific so that it can verified for any given trade; and
e)	the allocation methodology must be consistently applied.

Floor Members may not exercise a Secondary Trading Right if such Floor
Member is the Initial Respondent acting as a broker.


(5) Trading Priority.  Any Floor Member who becomes the Initial Respondent
willing to trade the full quantity stated in the LOX RFQ at the ultimate
best bid and, or best offer will have a right of trading priority which will
entitle him to the full quantity stated in the RFQ, except in the case when
a Secondary Trading Right is exercised.


(E) LOX Execution.
1.  Time Limit Restriction. Once an Initial Respondent has been recognized
by the LBH, only the Initiating Member requesting the LOX RFQ, may hit such
LOX Bid or Offer (or both) and must do so within 30 seconds of LBH
recognition of the Initial Respondent subject to the following conditions:

2.	Exercise of Secondary Trading Rights.   If one or more Floor Members
exercises the Secondary Trading Rights provided by this rule, the LBH will
enforce such rights in the following manner:

Each Floor Member responding to the LOX RFQ (either as an Initial Respondent
or in exercise of a Secondary Trading Right) shall receive an allocation
equal to a weighted proportion based on the number of contracts bid or
offered by such Member as a percentage of the total quantity of all
contracts bid or offered in response to the LOX RFQ, as the case may be, at
the price accepted by the Initiating Member, provided,  however,

If, as a result of the allocation specified above, an Initial Respondent
acting as a broker would receive less than 50% of the total quantity, then
the LBH instead shall allocate no less than 50% of the total quantity to
such Initial Respondent with the remainder allocated to those exercising
their Secondary Trading Rights based on  the number of contracts bid or
offered by each such Floor Member as a percentage of all contracts bid or
offered pursuant to the exercise of Secondary Trading Rights.

Following execution of the LOX transaction, the LBH will confirm the parties
to the transaction and the quantity allocated to each respondent.

(F) Responsibility for LOX Orders.  A Floor Member shall not be liable for
failure to execute an order as a LOX order unless such order was designated
by the customer as a LOX order.

(G) Impact on Non-LOX Orders.  In no event shall a LOX order elect stop
loss, market-if-touched or other contingency orders, or otherwise affect
orders in the regular non-LOX market.

(H) Closing Period and Post-Close Prohibition.  LOX transactions will
neither be allowed during the closing period nor during the post-close
session for applicable contracts.

Hi Dutch,
 
You are correct, this is the related master number.  I would guess that by 9:30 ish Frank should have his numbers finalized, as my report is complete and ready for him to load.
 
I have not been forecasting EDF's number with treasury....if you believe that they will be sending this amount, please let me know so that I may inform treasury.
 
Thanks!

Notice No. 01-406

TO:		NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS AND MEMBER FIRMS
		NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS

FROM:		J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:	EXCHANGE TO INTRODUCE HENRY HUB SWAPS; LARGE ORDER EXECUTION
AND EXTENDED MONTHS IN NATURAL GAS FUTURES AND OPTIONS
____________________________________________________________________________
_____

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., today announced an expanded slate of
natural gas products and services that it plans to introduce on an expedited
basis, including an electronically traded, cleared Henry Hub swaps contract
for the December 3 trading session, which begins with the NYMEX ACCESS

session on Sunday night, December 2; listings of additional natural gas
futures contracts as far as six years out beginning with the NYMEX ACCESS

session tonight; extended natural gas options contracts beginning with the
Monday open outcry session; and large order execution (LOX) in the first two
months of the natural gas futures contract also beginning tomorrow.

The contract specifications for the Henry Hub swaps contract will closely
parallel those of the Henry Hub futures contract other than it will be
financially settled, based on the final settlement price of the Henry Hub
futures contract.  The trading symbol will be NN.  Trading will begin at 7
PM Sunday night, with a pre-opening session beginning at 3 PM.

The Exchange currently lists the natural gas futures contract for 36
consecutive months and will list an additional 36 consecutive months
beginning tomorrow.  The Exchange currently lists 12 consecutive months of
natural gas options and eight additional quarterly contracts on a
March/June/September/December cycle, and, on Monday, will add 12 additional
quarterly contracts on the same cycle.  The Henry Hub swaps contract will be
available for the closest 72 consecutive months.

LOX will be permitted throughout the open outcry sessions, except during the
closing range. Under the new procedures, orders for a minimum of 250
contracts and a maximum of 5,000 contracts will be permitted outside of the
bid/ask spread for smaller trades, as long as the trade is within the
session's maximum price fluctuation limits.

Floor traders wishing to participate in a LOX market on behalf of a customer
or themselves must verbally submit a request for quote (RFQ) to an Exchange
employee, who will act as the LOX book holder, stipulating the delivery
month and number of contracts involved. The book holder will only recognize
initial responses that are for the full amount of the RFQ. Once a response
to the RFQ is formally recognized, the requesting member has 30 seconds to
react to the market.

There will be a $2.50 per contract charge for any RFQ that receives a
responding quote. If the RFQ results in a trade, the fee will be reduced to
$1.50 per contract.

Members trading for their own accounts may participate in a trade subsequent
to the initial response, but the member who first responded with the best
bid or offer for the large order will never receive less than a 50%
allocation of a completed trade.

In addition to formally recognizing the participants involved in a LOX
order, the book holder will be responsible for enforcing time limits,
maintaining records, and ensuring that trades with multiple responding
participants are allocated to the provisions in the rules.

Previously, in Notice to Members #01-366, the Exchange announced a new
program that commenced on November 1, 2001 and that permits the exchange of
swaps for futures in Natural Gas futures contracts.  As an informational
follow-up to yesterday's notice, this notice includes the text of the new
LOX rule.

				AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 6.21A

(Asterisks indicate additions; brackets indicate deletions.)

 Rule 6.21A.  EXCHANGE OF FUTURES FOR, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, SWAP
TRANSACTIONS  (Pilot Program)

(A) (1) An exchange of futures for, or in connection with, a swap (EFS)
consists of two discrete, but related, transactions; a swap transaction and
a futures transaction.  At the time such transaction is effected, the buyer
and seller of the futures must be, respectively, the seller and the buyer of
the swap.  The swap component shall involve the commodity underlying the
futures contract (or a derivative, by-product or related product of such
commodity).  The quantity covered by the swap must be approximately
equivalent to the quantity covered by the futures contracts.  The swap
component of an EFS transaction must comply with the applicable CFTC swap
regulatory requirements.  The initial term of the pilot program shall be
three years from the effective date of this Rule 6.21A.

	(2) Eligible Contracts and Transactions.  EFS transactions may be
effected only for transactions in the Exchange's Brent crude oil futures
contract  * or in the Henry Hub Natural Gas futures contract (for a period
of six months following implementation of the pilot program for Natural Gas
EFS transactions) * .

(B)(1)  The report of an EFS transaction shall be given on the Floor of the
Exchange during the hours of futures trading.  (2) EFS transactions *
involving the Brent contract * are permitted until the close of trading on
the last trading day in the expiring contract month [of the applicable
contract(s)].  * (3) EFS transactions involving Natural Gas contract are
permitted until two hours after trading terminates on the last day of
trading in the expiring contract month. *

(C)  A report of such EFS transaction shall be submitted to the Exchange by
each Clearing Member representing the buyer and/or seller.  Such report
shall identify the EFS as made under this Rule and shall contain the
following information: a statement that the swap component of the EFS
complied with the applicable CFTC swap regulatory requirements at the time
the EFS was entered into between the buyer and seller, a statement that the
EFS has resulted or will result in a change of payments or other such
change, the kind and quantity of the futures, the price at which the futures
transaction is to be cleared, the names of the Clearing Members and
customers and such other information as the Exchange may require.  Such
report (form) shall be submitted to the Compliance Department by 12:00 noon,
no later than two (2) Exchange business days after the day of posting the
EFS on the Floor of the Exchange.

(D)(1) Each buyer and seller must satisfy the Exchange, at its request, that
the transaction is a legitimate EFS transaction.  Upon the request of the
Exchange, all documentary evidence relating to the EFS, including a master
swap agreement and any supplements thereto, shall be obtained by the
Clearing Members from the buyer or seller and made available by the Clearing
Members for examination by the Exchange.  Additionally, if the buyer or
seller is a Member/Member Firm, the Exchange may obtain the information
directly from such person(s).

(2) For [all NYMEX Division contracts] * the Brent contract *, no EFS that
is linked to or contingent upon entry into a second, offsetting swap
transaction may be transacted during Regular Trading Hours at any time that
NYMEX offers trading in its contracts, unless trading in a market is halted,
such as during a physical emergency.   * For the Natural Gas contract, no
EFS that is linked to or contingent upon entry into a second, offsetting
swap transaction may be transacted at any time. *

(3)	Failure by a buyer or seller, or its Clearing Member to satisfy the
Exchange that an EFS transaction is bona fide shall subject such buyer or
seller, if a Member/Member Firm, or the Clearing Member to disciplinary
action.  Such disciplinary action, depending on the gravity of the offense,
may be deemed to be a major offense of the Exchange's rules.  Further, if
the buyer or seller is not a Member/Member Firm, the Exchange may conduct a
hearing before the Business Conduct Committee to limit, condition or deny
access to the market.

(E) Each EFS transaction shall be posted by the Floor Members and cleared
through the Exchange in accordance with normal procedures and by the
Clearing Members involved.

(F)  All omnibus accounts and foreign brokers shall submit a signed EFS
reporting agreement in the form prescribed by the Exchange to the Exchange's
Compliance Department.  Such Agreement shall provide that any omnibus
account or foreign broker identified by a Clearing Member (or another
omnibus account or foreign broker) as the buyer or seller of an EFS pursuant
to Rule 6.21A(C), shall supply the name of its customer and such other
information as the Exchange may require.  Such information shall be
submitted to the Exchange's Compliance Department by 12:00 noon no later
than two (2) Exchange business days after the day of posting the EFS on the
Floor of the Exchange.  Failure by an omnibus account or foreign broker to
submit either the agreement or the particular EFS information to the
Exchange may result in a hearing by the Business Conduct Committee to limit,
condition or deny access of such omnibus account or foreign broker to the
market.

Dutch - please double check the below information and comment on it.  


According to Man, Man expected these positions to be xpitted per their conversations with Dutch and John on 10/31/2001.  They were not xpitted.  If these were supposed to be xpitted and we did not do it, please sign off on it so Jason and Errol can implement it early on Friday 11/2.  
Please call me if there is any confusion so that we can put this issue to rest as early as possible.  

Thanks, Sarah

On Tuesday, Oct. 30 Warren Tashnek (Fimat Houston) and Steve Forman (Fimat =
NY) telephoned me to inform Enron that Fimat cut its trading lines from $20=
 million to $11 million for Enron.  This cut is irrespective of the $20 mil=

ENE positions were expitted from ABN to Fimat.  The positions came from exi=
sting positions at ABN, JP Morgan, SSB and Goldman Sachs.  Generally broker=
s agree how to handle expitting of trades including the transfer of cash as=
sociated with the moving of the trades.=20
Specifically a major issue evolved with ABN and Fimat.  In this case, Fimat=
 agreed with ABN to transfer the trades at the trade price and then rebook =
them at the trade price.  There was a $10 million variation margin associat=
ed with this transfer of trades at the trade price which ABN agreed to send=
 on Friday to Fimat.  Since Fimat agreed to accept the trades at the trade =
price, Fimat was exposed in the event that ABN did not send the $10 million=
 on Friday.  If Fimat had agreed to transfer the trades at the settlement r=
ate instead of the trade price then Fimat would not have been exposed for $=
10 million in variation margin on Thursday night.   =20

Friday, 10/26
On Friday, Fimat did not receive its $10 million from ABN as agreed.  When =
Fimat called ABN, ABN told Fimat that ENE called ABN and instructed ABN to =
send the money directly to ENE.  This left Fimat exposed for $10 million on=
 behalf of Enron. =20
On Friday morning, Fimat brokerage statements showed that ENE was owed $28 =
million by Fimat.  Fimat sent $5.7 million to Soc Gen to pay down the Soc G=
en margin line for Enron.  This left $22 million available for ENE but Fima=
t wanted its $10 million.  This led to confusion between Enron and Fimat.=
=20
On Friday, there was a conversation between Fimat NY and Fimat Montreal.  F=
imat Montreal asked Fimat NY to take positions on behalf of ENE.  The numbe=
r of positions and the variation margin associated with these positions wer=
e undisclosed. =20
Very late on Friday, HSBC tried to transfer Canadian positions to Fimat Can=
ada without an account for Enron at Fimat Canada. =20
Based in the bad press on Enron and the gossip in the financial community r=
ight now, Fimat NY told Fimat Montreal to refuse the transfer. =20
Fimat wants to know why Enron is expitting trades from bigger brokerage hou=
ses that have increased risk allocations fro Enron.  Fimat is uncomfortable=
 with these events. =20

Monday, 10/29
Fimat decides it wants an explanation from Enron.  Fimat wants to reassess =
the brokerage statements and double check both the amount of money transfer=
red to them and also the positions transferred.  Fimat informed Enron that =
it would not move money based on brokerage statements alone.  Fimat would n=
ot confirm to Enron what amounts of money should actually move until later =
in the day.  This does not work for Enron as we must inform our Treasure by=
 8:00 am as to what cash transfers will occur.  Under our current loan agre=
ement with Soc Gen, Fimat informs Soc Gen by 12:00 noon if money should mov=
e so Fimat is changing its way of doing business with Enron based on its di=
scomfort with ENE as a counter party. =20

Tuesday, 10/30
100 positions were expitted to Fimat to offset the gas positions from ABN.

Fimat proposed solutions
$3 million T-bill posted to Fimat as collateral on ENE behalf
Guarantee to Fimat with respect to trading from ENE (although ENE has alrea=
dy posted guarantee to Soc Gen for margin line)
ENE to convince Soc Gen to guarantee to Fimat that Soc Gen will make paymen=
ts on ENE's behalf

My tkae on the situation:
Fimat is upset based mainly on Enron's handling of expitted trades and bad =
press.  I told Fimat that I believed the reason trades were expitted to Fim=
at was that ENE wanted to move its positions to brokers who were offering m=
argin lines to ENE.  I promised to look into our handling or mishandling of=
 the situaiton but it seems that disorganization rather than ill intent was=
 responsible for Fimat's inconveniences.   I explained that Enron is prepar=
ed neither to mediate between Soc Gen and Fimat nor to cause Soc Gen to mak=
e payments to Fimat on our behalf.  That issue should have been resolved wh=
en the amrgin line was set up and the payment mechanism has been working fi=
ne so far.  As far as the confusion with ABN, we were not party to the disc=
ussions betweeen Fimat and ABN and can not make any comment to that.    Fin=
ally we can not make margin payments to Fimat when we do not have proper no=
tice time.  I am sorry that there is bad press out there but I do not think=
 we should give Fimat special permission to comb through our statements on =
an on going basis.  This may have been necessary for them earlier this week=
 but they need to get their act together and get the proper number to us ea=
rly in the morning like all the other brokers. =20

We need to determine how much we need Fimat right now.  I am not inclined t=
o entirely blow them off especially sinces I  do not want them to tell othe=
r brokers that we are acting strangely and hurt our reputation further righ=
t now.  At the same time, no one around Enron needs more work right now and=
 we can not hold a high maintenance broker's hand hand every step of the wa=
y.  Let's decide what to do and implement.

RE:		Natural Gas Futures Opening Procedures Six Month Rolling
Open

Please be advised that beginning Friday, December 7, 2001, the Exchange will
implement a six month rolling open in Natural Gas Futures.  The new opening
will be conducted as follows:

During the opening of Natural Gas Futures the spot month will be opened.
After a one minute period the second contract month will be opened, the
first month will remain open for trading.  When another minute has elapsed
the third month will be opened, the spot and second month will remain open.

This procedure will continue through the first six contract months.  At the
conclusion of the opening period for the first six nearby months, all other
contract months will be opened simultaneously.

Anytime during the open, members can trade outright trades and spreads in
any of the months that have been previously opened.

Should you require additional information regarding these procedures, please
call Robert Stasi 299-2067 or Brian Bartichek 299-2057.

Hi Greg and Georganne,
 
Per our statement from EDF Man today, it appears that we have excess on our account of $9,535,870.00.  Upon speaking to Paul at EDF Man, he told me that no money would be transfered.  He said that someone in their office was speaking to Marty Timmins in our office..???  Have either of you heard anything regarding the wire for today?  
 
I thank you for your help in this matter.

EDF is concerned because they are worried about the number of positions they are taking on for Enron.  They want to make an additional margin call of $45 million which ENE is not willing to post (true reason: corporate liquidity issues.) According to our broker agreement with EDF, EDF is not allowed to request more margin than the NYMEX requires so we refused on that basis.  EDF may want to reduce the positions they are holding based on their perceived risk of ENE.  Ira Polk, the CFO of EDF Man said the best person to talk to is Marty Timmonds.  I would not call him up and volunteer to move positions but if he calls you and wants to do so, the moving of positions was agreed to as one way to reduce EDF Man's risk without ENE posting additional cash margin.

What I was remembering was the front months exposures we had at EDF MAN.
	Prior to moves                After
DEC	-2,003			 1,967
JAN	10,502			-1,588
FEB	 1,338			   552

the over all position before the move was 1,240 and as of yesterday it is 4,205.

Let me know what the concerns are at EDF MAN and the request that they are making.
We can shift some positions around if the have levels by months that they want us to stay under.

Notice No. 01-409
November 29, 2001

TO:		All Exchange Members / Member Firms
		All Clearing Members

FROM:	J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:		TEMPORARY EXCHANGE OF OPTIONS FOR OPTIONS TRANSACTIONS IN
ENERGY MARKETS

The Exchange will introduce a temporary program beginning tomorrow that will
allow participants in its energy markets to exchange over-the-counter (OTC)
options positions for options positions on the Exchange (EOO).

This program will have a fixed 30-day time limit and will end on December
28.

EOO transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical and
exchange of futures for swaps transactions.  Two parties are allowed to
privately negotiate the execution of on- and off-exchange options positions
on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties. The transactions must
involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market quantities of
options exposures in the same or related commodities.

These transactions will be permitted to liquidate, initiate, and transfer
options market positions between the two parties involved in the
transaction. The clearing member representing each party will be responsible
to notify the Exchange of the amount and type of options contracts involved,
the price at which the transaction should be cleared, and the identity of
the parties involved.

Hi Dutch,
 
I hated to call you to tell you I still don't have an answer from EDF Man.  I spoke to Paul again about 5 min. ago (1:45) and he tells me that he still can't get an answer but that I'm the first on the list to call!!??  I then called our treasury department and spoke to Nera and she says that the wire has not come in as of yet.
 
I'll let you know as soon as I do!

Subject:=09Reduction of trading lines by Fimat

Dutch - there is a mess with Fimat and since you used to run John's book an=
d may see something in this situation I do not, I wondered if you could giv=
e me any feedback in this before I send it to Deffner.  Thanks, Sarah=09


On Tuesday, Oct. 30 Warren Tashnek (Fimat Houston) and Steve Forman (Fimat =
NY) telephoned me to inform Enron that Fimat cut its trading lines from $20=
 million to $11 million for Enron.  This cut is irrespective of the $20 mil=
lion credit limit we have from Soc Gen for the margin line.  (Soc Gen is th=
e bank that owns Fimat brokerage.)  Fimat made this decision based on the f=
ollowing events according to Steve:

Thursday 10/25
ENE positions were expitted from ABN to Fimat.  The positions came from exi=
sting positions at ABN, JP Morgan, SSB and Goldman Sachs.  Generally broker=
s agree how to handle expitting of trades including the transfer of cash as=
sociated with the moving of the trades.=20
Specifically a major issue evolved with ABN and Fimat.  In this case, Fimat=
 agreed with ABN to transfer the trades at the trade price and then rebook =
them at the trade price.  There was a $10 million variation margin associat=
ed with this transfer of trades at the trade price which ABN agreed to send=
 on Friday to Fimat.  Since Fimat agreed to accept the trades at the trade =
price, Fimat was exposed in the event that ABN did not send the $10 million=
 on Friday.  If Fimat had agreed to transfer the trades at the settlement r=
ate instead of the trade price then Fimat would not have been exposed for $=
10 million in variation margin on Thursday night.   =20

Friday, 10/26
On Friday, Fimat did not receive its $10 million from ABN as agreed.  When =
Fimat called ABN, ABN told Fimat that ENE called ABN and instructed ABN to =
send the money directly to ENE.  This left Fimat exposed for $10 million on=
 behalf of Enron. =20
On Friday morning, Fimat brokerage statements showed that ENE was owed $28 =
million by Fimat.  Fimat sent $5.7 million to Soc Gen to pay down the Soc G=
en margin line for Enron.  This left $22 million available for ENE but Fima=
t wanted its $10 million.  This led to confusion between Enron and Fimat.=
=20
On Friday, there was a conversation between Fimat NY and Fimat Montreal.  F=
imat Montreal asked Fimat NY to take positions on behalf of ENE.  The numbe=
r of positions and the variation margin associated with these positions wer=
e undisclosed. =20
Very late on Friday, HSBC tried to transfer Canadian positions to Fimat Can=
ada without an account for Enron at Fimat Canada. =20
Based in the bad press on Enron and the gossip in the financial community r=
ight now, Fimat NY told Fimat Montreal to refuse the transfer. =20
Fimat wants to know why Enron is expitting trades from bigger brokerage hou=
ses that have increased risk allocations fro Enron.  Fimat is uncomfortable=
 with these events. =20

Monday, 10/29
Fimat decides it wants an explanation from Enron.  Fimat wants to reassess =
the brokerage statements and double check both the amount of money transfer=
red to them and also the positions transferred.  Fimat informed Enron that =
it would not move money based on brokerage statements alone.  Fimat would n=
ot confirm to Enron what amounts of money should actually move until later =
in the day.  This does not work for Enron as we must inform our Treasure by=
 8:00 am as to what cash transfers will occur.  Under our current loan agre=
ement with Soc Gen, Fimat informs Soc Gen by 12:00 noon if money should mov=
e so Fimat is changing its way of doing business with Enron based on its di=
scomfort with ENE as a counter party. =20

Tuesday, 10/30
100 positions were expitted to Fimat to offset the gas positions from ABN.

Fimat proposed solutions
$3 million T-bill posted to Fimat as collateral on ENE behalf
Guarantee to Fimat with respect to trading from ENE (although ENE has alrea=
dy posted guarantee to Soc Gen for margin line)
ENE to convince Soc Gen to guarantee to Fimat that Soc Gen will make paymen=
ts on ENE's behalf

My tkae on the situation:
Fimat is upset based mainly on Enron's handling of expitted trades and bad =
press.  I told Fimat that I believed the reason trades were expitted to Fim=
at was that ENE wanted to move its positions to brokers who were offering m=
argin lines to ENE.  I promised to look into our handling or mishandling of=
 the situaiton but it seems that disorganization rather than ill intent was=
 responsible for Fimat's inconveniences.   I explained that Enron is prepar=
ed neither to mediate between Soc Gen and Fimat nor to cause Soc Gen to mak=
e payments to Fimat on our behalf.  That issue should have been resolved wh=
en the amrgin line was set up and the payment mechanism has been working fi=
ne so far.  As far as the confusion with ABN, we were not party to the disc=
ussions betweeen Fimat and ABN and can not make any comment to that.    Fin=
ally we can not make margin payments to Fimat when we do not have proper no=
tice time.  I am sorry that there is bad press out there but I do not think=
 we should give Fimat special permission to comb through our statements on =
an on going basis.  This may have been necessary for them earlier this week=
 but they need to get their act together and get the proper number to us ea=
rly in the morning like all the other brokers. =20

We need to determine how much we need Fimat right now.  I am not inclined t=
o entirely blow them off especially sinces I  do not want them to tell othe=
r brokers that we are acting strangely and hurt our reputation further righ=
t now.  At the same time, no one around Enron needs more work right now and=
 we can not hold a high maintenance broker's hand hand every step of the wa=
y.  Let's decide what to do and implement.

Subject: Hello!



It's Friday, and I'm here settling Nymex.  I got a phone call from Evelyn Wednesday before Thanksgiving to come in today.  It's o.k.  I don't mind.  I get Monday off.  Just a few notes to let you know what's going on.  EDF Mann, Paribas and Carr Futures London pulled a fast one.  They set the margin at 150% more of what it would have been.  Here are the numbers incoming and outgoing.

        OUTGOING                

                Smith Barney Financial                  $232,499.00 
                Paribas                                 $46,026,588.00 
                EDF Mann                                $760,515.00 
                Carr Futures                            $12,331,010.66 

        INCOMING 

                ABN Amro                                $33,852.00 
                Saul Stone                              $19,800.00 
                HSBC                                    $291,325.00 
                HSBC Canada                             No Margin Call 
                R. J. Obrien                            $12,320.00 
                J.P. Morgan                             $292,827.00 
                Credit Suisse                           $200,261.00 
                

Lori at Smith Barney was not in Friday, so we did not settle.  

FIMAT was not in, and the numbers came out like this.  They were supposed to have paid down on the loan by $2,931,087.24.  I don't know how you handle this.  Hopefully they will do this on Monday.

I know this is a terrible welcome back, but it was something that had to be done.

Notice No. 01-398

TO:		NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS AND MEMBER FIRMS
		NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS

FROM:		J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:	CORRECTION: REMINDER ON EFS REQUIREMENTS FOR NATURAL GAS
FUTURES
____________________________________________________________________________
_____

Previously, in Notice to Members #01-366, the Exchange announced a new
program that commenced on November 1, 2001 and that permits the exchange of
swaps for futures in Natural Gas futures contracts.  As an informational
follow-up to that notice, this notice includes the text of this EFS rule.

				AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 6.21A

(Asterisks indicate additions; brackets indicate deletions.)

 Rule 6.21A.  EXCHANGE OF FUTURES FOR, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, SWAP
TRANSACTIONS  (Pilot Program)

(A) (1) An exchange of futures for, or in connection with, a swap (EFS)
consists of two discrete, but related, transactions; a swap transaction and
a futures transaction.  At the time such transaction is effected, the buyer
and seller of the futures must be, respectively, the seller and the buyer of
the swap.  The swap component shall involve the commodity underlying the
futures contract (or a derivative, by-product or related product of such
commodity).  The quantity covered by the swap must be approximately
equivalent to the quantity covered by the futures contracts.  The swap
component of an EFS transaction must comply with the applicable CFTC swap
regulatory requirements.  The initial term of the pilot program shall be
three years from the effective date of this Rule 6.21A.

	(2) Eligible Contracts and Transactions.  EFS transactions may be
effected only for transactions in the Exchange's Brent crude oil futures
contract  * or in the Henry Hub Natural Gas futures contract (for a period
of six months following implementation of the pilot program for Natural Gas
EFS transactions) * .

(B)(1)  The report of an EFS transaction shall be given on the Floor of the
Exchange during the hours of futures trading.  (2) EFS transactions *
involving the Brent contract * are permitted until the close of trading on
the last trading day in the expiring contract month [of the applicable
contract(s)].  * (3) EFS transactions involving Natural Gas contract are
permitted until two hours after trading terminates on the last day of
trading in the expiring contract month. *

(C)  A report of such EFS transaction shall be submitted to the Exchange by
each Clearing Member representing the buyer and/or seller.  Such report
shall identify the EFS as made under this Rule and shall contain the
following information: a statement that the swap component of the EFS
complied with the applicable CFTC swap regulatory requirements at the time
the EFS was entered into between the buyer and seller, a statement that the
EFS has resulted or will result in a change of payments or other such
change, the kind and quantity of the futures, the price at which the futures
transaction is to be cleared, the names of the Clearing Members and
customers and such other information as the Exchange may require.  Such
report (form) shall be submitted to the Compliance Department by 12:00 noon,
no later than two (2) Exchange business days after the day of posting the
EFS on the Floor of the Exchange.

(D)(1) Each buyer and seller must satisfy the Exchange, at its request, that
the transaction is a legitimate EFS transaction.  Upon the request of the
Exchange, all documentary evidence relating to the EFS, including a master
swap agreement and any supplements thereto, shall be obtained by the
Clearing Members from the buyer or seller and made available by the Clearing
Members for examination by the Exchange.  Additionally, if the buyer or
seller is a Member/Member Firm, the Exchange may obtain the information
directly from such person(s).

(2) For [all NYMEX Division contracts] * the Brent contract *, no EFS that
is linked to or contingent upon entry into a second, offsetting swap
transaction may be transacted during Regular Trading Hours at any time that
NYMEX offers trading in its contracts, unless trading in a market is halted,
such as during a physical emergency.   * For the Natural Gas contract, no
EFS that is linked to or contingent upon entry into a second, offsetting
swap transaction may be transacted at any time. *

(3)	Failure by a buyer or seller, or its Clearing Member to satisfy the
Exchange that an EFS transaction is bona fide shall subject such buyer or
seller, if a Member/Member Firm, or the Clearing Member to disciplinary
action.  Such disciplinary action, depending on the gravity of the offense,
may be deemed to be a major offense of the Exchange's rules.  Further, if
the buyer or seller is not a Member/Member Firm, the Exchange may conduct a
hearing before the Business Conduct Committee to limit, condition or deny
access to the market.

(E) Each EFS transaction shall be posted by the Floor Members and cleared
through the Exchange in accordance with normal procedures and by the
Clearing Members involved.

(F)  All omnibus accounts and foreign brokers shall submit a signed EFS
reporting agreement in the form prescribed by the Exchange to the Exchange's
Compliance Department.  Such Agreement shall provide that any omnibus
account or foreign broker identified by a Clearing Member (or another
omnibus account or foreign broker) as the buyer or seller of an EFS pursuant
to Rule 6.21A(C), shall supply the name of its customer and such other
information as the Exchange may require.  Such information shall be
submitted to the Exchange's Compliance Department by 12:00 noon no later
than two (2) Exchange business days after the day of posting the EFS on the
Floor of the Exchange.  Failure by an omnibus account or foreign broker to
submit either the agreement or the particular EFS information to the
Exchange may result in a hearing by the Business Conduct Committee to limit,
condition or deny access of such omnibus account or foreign broker to the
market.

Notice No. 01-372
November 2, 2001

TO:		All Exchange Members / Member Firms

FROM: 	J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:		EXCHANGE TO LOWER COST OF EXCHANGE OF FUTURES FOR SWAP
TRANSACTIONS

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., today announced that it would lower
the cost of exchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions to $2.50 per
contract per side from $10 per contract per side and would apply the
discounted fee retroactively to the natural gas transactions conducted since
the start of the program yesterday.

We are gratified that the strong response to the introduction of this
trading instrument will allow us to so heavily discount the transaction fee.

The Exchange introduced EFS transactions in its natural gas futures market
yesterday as the first step of its plans to offer clearing services to the
over-the-counter (OTC) natural gas market.  In its first full day, there
were 11,100 contracts that changed hands in EFS transactions.

EFS transactions work similarly to exchange of futures for physical (EFP)
transactions.  Two parties are allowed to privately negotiate the execution
of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures transaction on
pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The transaction must
involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market quantities of
futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities and are
permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the underlying futures
contract.

EFS transactions are permitted to liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures
market positions between the two parties involved in the transaction.  The
clearing member representing each party is responsible to notify the
Exchange of the amount of futures contracts involved, the price at which the
futures transaction should be cleared, and the identity of the parties
involved.

Year-to-date average daily volume in natural gas futures is approximately
60,000 contracts.  Yesterday's volume, including the EFS transactions was

Hi Everyone,
 
Just an FYI....I will be out the office next week starting November 19th and returning on the 26th.  Cynthia Shoup will be handling Nymex Settlement in my absense and she can be reached at ext. 3-7328.
 
As some of you are aware, I normally have to settle margins the day after Thanksgiving as it an Enron holiday, not a bank holiday.  I have pleaded with all my brokers and they agreed to push settlement to the 26th upon my return.  If any of you should anticipate any problems with this, please let me know.
 
The very happiest of Thanksgiving to all!
 
Thanks!

Hi Greg and Georganne,
 
Per our statement from EDF Man today, it appears that we have excess on our account of $9,535,870.00.  Upon speaking to Paul at EDF Man, he told me that no money would be transfered.  He said that someone in their office was speaking to Marty Timmins in our office..???  Have either of you heard anything regarding the wire for today?  
 
I thank you for your help in this matter.

One of the reasons I asked about traders' reluctance to deal with Enron is the article below questions our ability to deliver on winter gas.  I would like to prepare an answer in case anyone asks.

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- With two outs in the bottom of the ninth and down by two runs with one man on, Enron Corp. (ENE) needs nothing less than a home run just to stay in the game.
This is the home run Enron must come up with: Full disclosure of the assets and liabilities of those troubled partnerships that have been kept off their balance sheet, and proof the corporation can cover the difference. It's what stockholders, bondholders and trading partners have been demanding, but time is running out, and Enron hasn't produced. 
"We're going to get to that number soon and tell people. We have to do that," said a source at Enron, who didn't know how quickly the disclosure would come or whether it would be independently audited. "In this environment, we are going to be absolutely sure that it's accurate." 
Enron has about $3.3 billion in debt on the two key partnerships payable in 2003. The company will sell the assets in those partnerships and, in a worse case scenario, will face a $1 billion shortfall that could be covered by selling stock and other company assets, Enron has said. The company hopes that when the time comes to issue new stock, shares will be trading closer to $20 than their current $11. 
Investors, however, aren't acting as if they're reassured. Part of the trouble, analysts with credit-rating firm Standard & Poor's said Friday morning, is that until Enron sells the assets, nobody knows for sure what they're worth or how deep the partnerships are in the hole. 
S&P is confident that Enron can raise enough capital to fill that hole, provided its trading partners in key energy markets continue to business with the company. 
Credit Derivative Fizzle 

To see the pickle the world's premier energy franchise is in, one needs to look no further than its credit derivatives trading desk. That relatively new and innovative operation was getting off the ground nicely, but the desk hasn't been able to transact for three weeks, since the value of Enron's stock and bonds began to plummet, according to another Enron employee. 
Enron didn't respond to a request for comment, but the Enron Credit division in Europe said in a release that lines are "constrained" as the market continues to evaluate the company's credit position. 
Until recently, customers would buy a credit derivative from Enron to cover its exposure to bankruptcy by a third company. A big supplier to a financially troubled company like Xerox Corp. (XRX) or Lucent Technologies (LU), for example, might pay Enron $1 million a year for a payout of, say, $10 million in the event of a bankruptcy. 
But you wouldn't pay the premium on your insurance unless you were sure that the insurance company could pay your claims. Likewise, with Enron's creditworthiness in doubt, there's no reason to pay a lot of money just to exchange Lucent risk for Enron risk. 
The same holds true, though less obviously, for Enron's core business of energy trading. Some utilities, large industrial companies and other energy trading companies could see their profits ruined if natural gas prices - already on the rise at $3 per million British thermal units - shoot to $10 this winter as they did last winter. 
To guard against that risk, companies buy contracts now for delivery this winter at set prices. If a company wants to lock in winter gas at $3, should it turn to Enron? If gas were to rise to $10 in January and Enron couldn't deliver, Enron's counterparty paid a good price for no protection. And if Enron failed in a $10 gas market, that would send hundreds of companies scrambling for supplies. Gas could go to $20 in a heartbeat. 
Leading Role An Asset 

Enron does have a man on base. The company is so important to energy market participants that they desperately want Enron to survive. And any company that moves to lock Enron out of the market now could regret doing so if Enron survives as the big dog. 
Enron's trading partners have a pretty consistent position at this point: They are continuing to trade with Enron, but are avoiding long-term deals that increase their exposure to the company. The only acceptable long-term deals are those that offset deals done earlier. Unless and until a bill goes unpaid, they'll keep delivering. 
Enron, like the rest of the U.S. energy industry, paid its bills for September gas deliveries on Oct. 20 and for its September electricity deliveries on Oct. 25. Its next power and gas bills come due in the third week of November. 
That means trading companies generally have just seven weeks of receivables at risk before Enron's creditworthiness faces another test. In exchange for taking on that small risk, they keep the great market maker in business. 
Lenders Show Concerns 

Lenders, whether through holding Enron bonds or providing loans, don't have the same luxury as energy trading companies that are keeping deals on a short leash. Lenders supply cash up front and for longer periods of time, usually years. 
Outside of long-term commitments, what worries the banks, which presumably got a good look at Enron's books? If Enron is now unable to make the big bets with long-term energy deals that have kept it profitable for years, can it service all of its liabilities, known and unknown? If it has to sell profitable assets like pipelines and power plants, or otherwise put those assets at risk, will lower earnings be enough to pay rising credit costs? What happens if its greatest asset - its traders - leave in droves to work elsewhere? 
If Enron is to have a chance, it needs energy trading profits to keep rolling in so that it can continue to service its debt. So far this year, trading and other wholesale operations have accounted for $2.2 billion out of $2.4 billion in net recurring income before interest and taxes. By comparison, Enron has made $617 million in interest payments so far this year. 
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. (C) unit Salomon Smith Barney, at least, don't show much confidence Enron can do it. When they agreed to provide Enron with a $1 billion line of credit, they did so only after Enron posted valuable gas pipelines as collateral. 
Bond traders - the most sophisticated investors in the world - make their money by understanding the probabilities. They're trading Enron debt at levels typically associated with distressed companies. 
The lenders have chalked up their runs. Shareholders have ratcheted up the pressure. 
Enron, now, must step up to the plate.
