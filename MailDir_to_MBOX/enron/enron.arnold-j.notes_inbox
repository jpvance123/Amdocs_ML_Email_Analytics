Dear Mr.. Lavorato,

The $1500 that you sent to us in October, has not been credited to our
account.If those funds were sent through AM TRADE INTERNATIONAL, you need to
have your bank send an amendment message stating that the respective funds
are intended for final credit to World Sports Exchange/ ACCT # 12307915.

Most likely, those funds are sitting at the Antigua Overseas Bank.

2. Another suggestion would be to call back those funds since the
beneficiary is not in receipt of payment, and resend it through the new
instruction as per our website.This method is guaranteed more efficient.

For any further questions, please call the accounts department at WSEX.

REGARDS
MARIA.
Accounts Manager

John,

Thanks for the email and the offer to route my resume in the most
expeditious way.  I saw only one job that was posted on Enron's website that
looked like a good fit.  It was an asset evaluation and integration job for
Enron North America: job # 0000105886.

My primary strengths are:

Natural gas asset acquisition and management
Supporting a trading organization by providing excellent futures and
derivatives execution
Trading proprietary books (fixed price or otherwise)where there is a
competitive reason to be     in the market, i.e. transportation spreads,
storage, physical presence
Good customer relations/account development
Ability to focus on and analyze a wide range of problems/opportunities
Stong negotiator

I know that Enron is a big, happening place and it is invaluble to have
someone like you to help me sort out the opportunities.  Where I am coming
from is that I have to more valuble to Enron than I am to Oxy because Oxy is
doing frustratingly little to leverage itself and Enron is setting every
trend imaginable in leveraging itself.

I appreciate any help you can provide.

Thanks.

Alan

It may help if you give specific positions that interest you most as Enron

Re: trucking LNG to California - 

The short answer is that trucking LNG to California is not a feasible option 
for endusers other than companies with LNG-fueled vehicle fleets. There are a 
couple of reasons for this. 

First, California has a relative abundance of LNG fueling stations but only 
two plants capable of regasification. One serves Borrego Springs, a small, 
affluent desert community near San Diego. The other is dedicated to military 
and industrial supply near Sacramento. I spoke this morning to Applied LNG 
Technologies, which is based in Amarillo and has the second largest LNG truck 
fleet (after Transgas in Massachusetts). It shouldn't be a surprise that I 
was not the first to call regarding this question. While ALT's fleet is 
operating at capacity - trucking LNG from liquefaction plants in Wyoming and 
Topock, Arizona - it's serving its normal fleet customers in Southern 
California and Nevada, and Arizona. The Topock, AZ plant is owned jointly by 
ALT and El Paso, and receives gas from El Paso for liquefaction and 
subsequent loading onto trucks.

Second, LNG trucks, unlike LNG tankers, carry an extremely small volume. The 
average truck carries 10,000 gallons of LNG, which translates roughly into 
820,000 cubic feet. ALT has about 23 vehicles so potentially one could 
deliver 18.8 mmcf. However, these trucks don't regasify LNG, they merely 
transfer it into storage. 

The only really viable option for putting gas into the pipeline system would 
be a portable pipeline unit, of which ALT has the only one (it's under 
repair). It can deliver high pressure gas at 1800 cubic feet/minute (2.6 
mmcf/day if it runs 24 hours). It has connections for two LNG trucks at a 
time - one live and one backup, so it can operate continuously. In the past, 
ALT has used the unit to cover industrials who had a supply outage for some 
reason. 

I'm going to continue gathering info on domestic LNG peakshaving plants, etc. 
I think the opportunity may lie more in future, more strategically located 
peakshaving plants rather than LNG trucking arbitrage. 

Please let me know if you have specific questions.

Hello Mr. Arnold,

I hope that things have calmed down in the gas market with the cold weather
finally developing.  I have been selected to come to Houston for final round
interviews.  Do you know if visitors can come to the trading floor to see
what the operations are like?  Also, if you have any hints on approaching
the final round of interviews, I would appreciate them.

Thank you for your help during the application process, and I hope you have
a good week.

Cordially,

Adam Bayer

The EOL Reporting Database treats any distinct deal number as a separate 
unique deal.  An example would be a deal done with KUKUI Inc. on November 
8th, 2000.  It is booked as deal numbers Q86409.1, Q86409.2, Q86409.3, and 
Q86409.4.  These are four separate and unique deal numbers and therefore 
count as a total of four deals.     

We understand that the trade desk may consider the deal in this example as 
just one large deal with 4 different parts.  Unfortunately,  the EOL 
Reporting Database has no way of telling whether or not these types of deals 
are distinct different deals or part of one larger deal.  Since this 
currently can not be known, the EOL Reporting Database uses the most 
conservative approach and counts them all as individual deals.  This results 
in a higher OTC deal count and thus a lower EOL percentage of all deals.

If you have any further questions , please don't hesitate to ask.

Arnold,

John Grass and myself would be happy to update you on the status of Enron's 
Producer One deals.  In addition to the three deals listed below, we have a 
substantial "pipeline" of transactions that are being evaluated and are in 
different stages.  Besides John Grass, our distribution channels for producer 
ecommerce deals are driven by Producer Services (Gary Bryan, Jill Zivley, 
Linda Roberts and Jennifer Martinez), Nelson Ferries, Production Offshore as 
well as ECR.  Enron has just recently completed a nine city road show 
targeting the producer community.  

John Grass is also managing the Wellhead desk.

they are crazy but mite have to scale in which i have a little and have some
sort of length on,sprd length in the front to hedge weather risk-if ny stays 5
bucks or so above hub seems hard to think jan /feb gonna fall much. also know
aron and some of them "pre rolled" jan/feb goldman rolls not sure if they bot 
em
back, start pxing tomorrow.doubt they have much any impact on the sprd.
    am a bit worried as are most what we must be doing to industrial
demand,switching at huge px sprds. tend to think ealry mid jan y on y stx gap
will fall do to aforementioned and rationing this mkt gonna fall-who knows 
from
what levels?? thots when you have a chance. distillate mkt save for addional
demand it shud be getting from natgas switching wud have been in trouble i 
think
so it will stay discount to gas

Hey freak-o!  How have you been?  I'm just taking a study break (finals,
ick!) and thought I would say hello.  What's new?  Have you moved into
your place yet?  Let me know if I can come and see it--I'll be home (in
college station) a week from Tuesday...am making a pit stop in Tahoe on
my way home...just gotta get thru these pesky exams first!

Greetings from la-la-land,
eleanor :-)

Following are the working transactions in the Central Region/Gas that include 
utility/producer outsourcing:

3rd Quarter

Peoples Energy Production Company
PEPC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Peoples Energy/Chicago.   Transaction 
consists of back-office, risk management and production management for their 
Production company.  Currently performing due diligence and will be making 
proposal (in conjunction with Jean Mrha's group).  Total volume of 30,000 
MMbtu/d oil/gas equivalent for 3 years.   50% probability for closure.

4th Quarter

MGU-Michigan Gas Utilities
MGU is wholly owned subsidiary of Utilicorp.  Transaction is a complete 
outsourcing for the utility (28 BCF/year) for a term of 3 years beginning 
October 2001.  MGU will choose a singular counter-party to proceed to 
structure/negotiations in the next few weeks.  We have received very positive 
feedback from MGU and place our success rate at > 50%.  Original transaction 
priced as Michigan Index trade, but effort was to determine their choice 
counterparty.  Initial indications are that the final structure will consist 
of a basket of index Daily/FOM and fixed price.  Russell Murrell and I have 
been working closely with the decision makers at MGU to ensure success.

SEMCO (Project Pluto)
Utility based in Port Huron, Michigan with sales load of approximately 37 
BCF/year.  Portfolio currently outsourced to TransCanada (4/1/1999-3/31/2002) 
and has been extremely beneficial to SEMCO.  TransCanada (See Gas Daily 
4/30/01) currently holds all fixed priced risk for load following and 
management at around $3.60 and SEMCO was the only Michigan utility who 
effectively managed the arrangements the Michigan utilities negotiated with 
their commission.  Bids are due in August and a counterparty will be chosen 
3rd/4th quarter 2001 for a 3 year transaction commencing 4/1/2002.   Visited 
their office with Sylvia Pollan on 4/11 and our risk is removing the 
incumbent, TransCanada.   SEMCO will be proposing a fixed price structure to 
Michigan commission.

On MGU and SEMCO, the Michigan commission will play a significant role in 
dictating final structures.  If Enron is not successful, these utilities will 
be managed by other 3rd parties and we will keep you abreast of structure 
outcomes.

Thanx,
Laura

John -

I left a message about this last week, but wanted to follow-up with
additional information for your review.  We have three offerings currently
available (or coming soon) that I feel would compliment the small/mid cap
and fixed income exposure you already have through Redwood, Sequoia, and
Willow.

to drive aggressive (and potentially leveraged) asset allocation decisions.
Generates exposure to stock and bond markets through indexing techniques and
futures transactions.  Portfolio market exposures can range from +325% to
-175% of net assets.  This is clearly different from the largely
non-leveraged stock-picker funds you already own.  I would consider this to
be a predominately large-cap investment (I think of it as an index fund with
a brain and on steroids - call me and I'll explain that comment in more
detail).

Juniper Crossover Fund, LLC: Managed by OrbiMed Advisors, and focused on
global biotech and pharma.  Up to 30% participation in private equity.  This
could be a way to get you some private equity exposure with a world-class
manager.

Tamarack International Fund, LLC: Long/short stock-picker fund focused on
the international mid-cap market.  I feel this fund is very similar in style
to the managers you already own, but would give you exposure to the
international markets that you currently lack.  This is a new fund and the
first closing will probably be in June.

Of course, the summaries above are for information purposes only and do not
constitute an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy interests in
these funds.  Please call me if you're interested in any of the strategies
outlined above, and I'll have the appropriate offering memorandum sent to
you.

Please see the following instructions for the new messenging board.  If you 
have any trouble entering into this site, please let me know.  Everyone 
should now be setup and ready to go. You will have to add this site to one of 
your favorites.  

The Gas Message Board application can run on both IE5.0 and IE5.5 now. 

Attached is the URL for user to run the application.

http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com

Please feel free to forward above URL to people who like to test the 
application. 

Here is the steps they should do:

1) Launch Internet Explorer

2) Type: http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com (or just open this email and 
click on above URL)

3) Users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today. If 
they don't see any messages, there are two reasons: 
 (1) They are not valid users. Their names have not been added into the NT 
Web_GasTraders Group yet. Please contact Chrysti Hardy to add their names 
into the group.
 (2) There is no new messages added yet.

4) Click on "Comments" button to add messages: there will be a popup window 
when user clicks on "comments" button. There are two ways to send the 
messages after typing the 
messages into the text box:
 (1) just simply press enter to send the message. or
 (2) click on "send" button to send the message.

5) After the message has been sent, The message will be displayed on the main 
window immediately, the rest people who are online will get the new message 
in less than 30 seconds. This time can be reduced to as less as 1 second. 
However, I would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10 
second.  Because each time the browser refreshes the screen, the screen will 
be blink. Users don't want the screen blink every second while they read the 
messages.

6) All messages will be cleaned up daily at 6:00PM. If they like to clean 
them up later than 6:00PM, please let me know. I can reset the time.

Note: Right now the application is under test environment. If they like it, I 
will move it into production environment soon.

Let me know any feedbacks.

Thanks,

Fangming

>Rabbi Sheldon Zimmerman, a leading figure in Judaism's Reform
>movement as president of its seminary, has resigned from his job
>after being suspended by the movement's rabbinic organization for
>having entered into "personal relationships" in the past that the
>organization said violated its ethical code.
>
> Rabbi Zimmerman, president of Hebrew Union College-Jewish
>Institute of Learning, where he had been considered a charismatic
>and innovative leader, quit that post on Monday, after the Central
>Conference of American Rabbis suspended his rabbinical functions
>for at least two years, college and conference officials said.
>
> In a statement, the college said the suspension followed an
>investigation by the conference into "personal relationships" of
>Rabbi Zimmerman, which it did not specify other than to say that
>they predated his appointment as president in January 1996. Rabbi
>Zimmerman was the seventh president of the college, which was
>founded in 1875.
>
> Rabbi Paul J. Menitoff, the conference's executive vice president,
>said its board approved the penalty on Monday, based on a
>recommendation by its ethics committee, which looks into complaints
>about the conference's 1,700 members.
>
> Rabbi Menitoff said that conference rules prevented him from
>discussing the case but that the board decided Rabbi Zimmerman had
>violated a part of the ethics code, paragraph 2A, which deals with
>sexual conduct.
>
> It is included in the section of the code on "personal
>responsibility," which covers such matters as family life, personal
>honesty and finances. It calls on rabbis "to be scrupulous in
>avoiding even the appearance of sexual misconduct, whether by
>taking advantage of our position with those weaker than ourselves
>or dependent on us or succumbing to the temptations of willing
>adults."
>
> Hebrew Union, which trains men and women as rabbis and cantors and
>in other graduate and professional fields, has 1,500 students on
>campuses in Cincinnati, Los Angeles, New York and Jerusalem. Before

I'm not sure if you have heard our fun news yet, but Rob and I are moving to
Boston at the first of the year!!

I will be working remotely for HBK while looking for something new up there.
Rob is continuing his career with Fidelity, though in a much more convenient
location.  The only downside is he will actually have to go into the office
every day!

We would love to see everybody before we leave, though it may not be
possible with the holidays.  I'll be back in Dallas once a week in January
and February, so we could plan to get together during one of those trips.
But before that time, Rob and I will be with a group of friends from HBK at
Martini Ranch on Thursday, December 14th right after work.  I'm sure we'll
be there late, given my love of martinis, so please stop by if you can.

Regardless, I really want to stay in touch with my Texas friends, so make
sure and send me your updated contact information if anything has changed in
the last year.  Please pass this on to people who I may have inadvertently
missed or I did not have their current email address.

Cheers,
Heather Robertson



P.S.
By the way, our house is on the market right now, so if you know of anyone
looking, please tell them about it.  The address is 6815 Vivian Avenue,
Dallas, 75223 and can be seen on www.ebby.com.

Hello all,

Several of you have inquired who would be attending the May 17 Guggenheim 
event on our behalf, whether Enron employees or guests.  While this list is 
always in motion, this should give you a good idea. 

I'm glad that each of you will be attending and hope that both you and your 
guests enjoy.  Please call me on my cell phone at 713-515-9208 if you need 
anything.  Otherwise, I will see you on the 17th at the Guggenheim.

Take care, Margaret Allen

Russ:

A couple of questions
1- Check the DOE Northeast Heating season  report.   There seem to be a lot 
of LNG terminal and facilities in the Northeast. How do they work? What are 
the logistics of transportation etc...


2- Arnold's buddy has been looking into the logistics of  trucking LNG to CA. 
Is this possible? Can investigate the probability?



Thanks

The attached report contains an analysis of fuel switching capability. It 
also details one  of the current problems with EIA data. The EIA data  
contains FERC form I data. Once generation is sold its fuel consumption is no 
longer reported to the DOE. Hence an analysis of the DOE cost  and quality of 
generation fuels is incomplete becasue of the lack of NUG data. WEFA gets 
around this by using 1998 FERC FORM I data. After 1998, there were 
significant sales of generation due to the ongoing legislation and 
deregulation at the state level.

Dabhol lenders to vote today on PPA PPPPA termination
Our Banking Bureau Mumbai

The 25-odd lenders to the Dabhol power project will vote today on whether the 
Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) should be allowed to to serve a 
preliminary PPA termination notice to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board 
(MSEB). The voting will take place through conference calls criss-crossing 
the globe at 6.30 pm, Indian Standard Time. Even though the three Indian 
lenders_ the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), the State Bank of 
India (SBI) and ICICI_ have decided to vote against the proposition, they 
will not be able to block the move.
Technically, the proposal can be passed if four per cent of lenders are in 
favour of the termination notice. In effect, it will be passed if one of the 
25 lenders casts its vote in favour of it. So, it's almost a foregone 
conclusion that DPC will be asked to issue its termination notice. 
Multilateral agency J-Exim, which has provided guarantees, will not 
participate in the exercise. Barring J-Exim, other financial intermediaries 
including global arrangers ABN Amro, Citi, ANZIB, CSFB and other banks and 
OPIC will cast their votes tomorrow. "In the first round, Indian lenders put 
their foot down and refused to give clearance to the termination notice. 
Thistime around they will not be able to block the move any more. The Indian 
lenders alone cannot save the controversial $3 billion as some of the foreign 
lenders are in favour of issuing the termination notice," said a source. The 
Indian lenders are in favour of completing the project without any time and 
cost over-run. They have disbursed about 80 per cent of their Rs 1,500 crore 
worth of loan commitments to phase II of the project, 93 per cent of which is 
complete. The trial run is expected to commence in June. The board of the 
Dabhol Power Company has already authorised Enron India managing director, K 
Wade Cline, to serve a termination notice as and when he deems fit. At a 
meeting of the lenders last month in London, the foreign lenders were keen 
that the termination notice be served in the face of defaults by the 
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and the Union government's refusal 
to honour the counter-guarantee of Rs 102 crore for the December bill. The 
domestic lenders are not covered by the counter-guarantee if the contract is 
terminated. The foreign lenders are covered by the counter-guarantee.

SAO PAULO (AFX) - Enron Corp will suspend investments of 600 mln usd in the 
Brazilian energy sector, news agency JB Online quoted Enron vice-president 
and Eletricidade e Servicos SA Elektro chairman Orlando Gonzales as saying. 
Of the total investment, 500 mln usd was to be assigned to the expansion of 
the thermoelectric plant Cuiaba II in the state of Mato Grosso, and in the 
construction of Rogen in the state of Rio de Janeiro, with the remainder to 
be invested in unit Elektro, it said.
"There are no clear regulations for the sector. Regulatory issues are holding 
back investments," JB Online quoted Gonzales as saying. 
Gonzales said the decision to suspend the investments may be reconsidered if 
the energy sector regulator Aneel establishes clearer regulations.

USA: Sempra unit to boost natgas delivery to California.

05/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SAN FRANCISCO, May 15 (Reuters) - Southern California Gas Co. (SCG) said in a 
statement on Tuesday it will add around 200 million cubic feet a day, or 
about six percent, to its pipeline system by the end of the year in order to 
meet the surge in demand for gas-fired power generation. 
Today's announcement comes two months after SCG, a unit of Sempra Energy , 
proposed to increase capacity on its system by 175 mmcfd, or five percent.
Both projects will add around 11 percent of new gas capacity to its 
transmission system this year, the company said in a statement. 
In its latest proposal, called the Kramer Junction Interconnect, SCG said it 
would build a 32-mile pipeline link to the Kern-Mojave pipeline system that 
will allow it to deliver around 200 mmcfd into its system. 
The new capacity would be enough to drive three 500-megawatt power plants or 
enough gas to serve 1.4 million residential customers a day, the statement 
said. 
SCG, the nation's largest gas utility with more 18 million consumers in 
central and Southern California, said utilization of its intrastate 
transmission system in the past nine months had jumped from 75 percent to 
over 95 percent, due largely to the rise in gas-fired power generation. 
The company's announcement is the latest in several proposals to expand gas 
pipeline capacity to California, where demand for gas is expected to jump 
because of the number of gas-fired power plants being built or scheduled for 
construction. 
Gas is already used to generate about a third of California's electricity. 
And since April 1999, the state has approved 13 major gas-fired power plant 
projects with a combined generation capacity of more than 8,900 megawatts. 
Nine gas-fired power plants, with a total generation capacity of more than 
6,000 megawatts, are under construction. 
Over the past two months plans to build or expand gas lines serving 
California have been announced by Enron unit Transwestern, Williams Cos' Kern 
River Transmission, El Paso Corp. units El Paso Natural Gas Co. and Mohave 
Pipeline Co., Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. unit National Energy Group, 
Questar Corp. , Calpine Corp. , and Kinder Morgan .

Enron Urges Reforms In Japan Electricity Market-Nikkei

05/15/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

TOKYO (Nikkei)--Asserting that cuts in electricity prices will help Japanese 
companies save as much as Y4 trillion, major U.S. energy firm Enron Corp. 
(ENE) on Tuesday urged Japanese power firms to revamp the electricity market 
by separating operations such as power generation, transmission and 
distribution, The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported. 
Enron's 10-point proposal also calls for the construction of more power 
plants and full-scale deregulation of retail electricity, including sales to 
households. If such measures are carried out and electricity prices fall to 
match the levels of other industrialized nations, Japan's industrial sector 
could trim its costs by Y4 trillion, Enron said.
At a seminar on power industry deregulation hosted by Enron, the company 
asserted that Japan's deregulation in such areas as wholesale electricity 
auctions in 1996 and bulk retail sales last year has not brought significant 
benefits to end-users. 
New suppliers entering the market only account for a combined 0.4% of the 
entire electricity sector, Enron said, criticizing the fact that power plant 
facilities are mainly concentrated among electric power companies. 
Regarding prices, an official representing operators of power generation 
facilities asserted that "industrial-use electricity prices in Japan are 
stuck at a high level at around Y13 per kilowatt, compared with Y5 in the 
U.S., Y3 in Canada, Y9 in Germany and Y4-Y8 in Southeast Asia." 
In fact, department store operator Takashimaya Co. (8233 or J.TKA), which 
last November switched to new market entrants for part of its electricity 
supply, was able to cut costs by Y450 million in the first year, said a 
company official. 
Enron hopes to generate competition by urging Japanese electric utilities to 
spin off different operations, analysts say. If the number of power 
generation facility operators increases, this will help bolster Japan's 
electricity trading market, an area in which Enron has a strong business 
interest. 
Splitting electricity operations into generation, transmission and 
distribution is expected to open the electric utility network to new 
entrants. This will boost transparency in the fees that electric power 
companies charge for transmitting power on behalf of the operators of power 
generation facilities, Enron says. 
Citing the power shortage in California, however, Japan's electricity sector 
has strongly opposed such spin-offs, stating that generation and distribution 
must be part of a single continuum to ensure a stable supply.

Enron Agrees to Provide Market Data to NGX

05/15/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

CALGARY, May 15 /PRNewswire/ - NGX Canada Inc. (NGX), a wholly owned 
subsidiary of OM AB (OM), today announced that an arrangement has been made 
with Enron Canada Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (Enron), 
whereby trading data from certain contracts listed on Enron's online trading 
system, EnronOnline will be included in the computation of three Alberta Gas 
Price Indices. 
NGX acquired the AECO "C" & NIT Daily Spot, One-Month Spot, and Bid-Week Spot 
gas price indices (Alberta Gas Price Indices) from Canadian Enerdata Ltd. 
last September. Subsequent to the acquisition of the Alberta Gas Price 
Indices, NGX has provided real-time information to its customers on the 
establishment of the weighted average price indices based on transactions 
conducted through NGX's trading system. Canadian Enerdata Limited continues 
to publish the Alberta Gas Price Indices in the Canadian Gas Price Reporter.
Peter Krenkel, President of NGX, stated, "We believe that inclusion of data 
from EnronOnline will serve to make our price indices among the best in North 
America. The industry has been very supportive of the visibility and 
integrity we are able to bring to the Alberta Gas Price Indices, which 
removes the guesswork around gas price index methodology. However, after 
reviewing the matter with Enron and other industry participants, we 
recognized that Enron had legitimate concerns and the industry felt that 
"more is better". The inclusion of data from the highly liquid EnronOnline 
system should improve the quality of our price indices even further." 
Rob Milnthorp, President and CEO of Enron Canada commented, "We are very 
pleased to have EnronOnline transactions included in the Alberta Gas Price 
Indices. This will provide industry participants with a more comprehensive 
source of data and a better opportunity to manage risk around these price 
indices as they are now assured that all their transactions on EnronOnline 
will be included in the computation of the Alberta Price Indices." 
The inclusion of EnronOnline data satisfies the principal claims made by 
Enron in their legal action against NGX, Canadian Enerdata Ltd., OM and 
Richard Zarzeczny and Enron has agreed to discontinue the legal action 
against those parties with the conclusion of this arrangement. 
NGX and Enron are planning to implement the necessary system changes by 
August 1, 2001 but in any event will provide at least thirty days notice to 
the industry. Once in operation, data from transactions in the relevant 
contracts listed on EnronOnline will be fed to NGX in real-time. The 
methodology for computing the Alberta Gas Price Indices will continue to be 
on a weighted-average basis. 
NGX will engage independent auditors to insure full compliance with the Index 
Methodology Guide. This guide is available on NGX's website at www.ngx.com. 
NGX located in Calgary, Canada provides electronic trading and clearing 
services to natural gas buyers and sellers at seven markets in Canada. Over 
the past six years, NGX has grown to serve over 120 customers with trading 
activity averaging 225,000 TJ's per month. NGX is owned 100% by OM

UAE To Seek New Partners If Enron Exits Dolphin Gas Proj

05/15/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- If U.S.-based Enron Corp. (ENE) pulls out of the $3.5 
billion Dolphin gas project, in which the company holds a 24.5% stake, the 
U.A.E. Offsets Group, or UOG, will consider other companies to replace it, a 
United Arab Emirates industry source close to the project said Tuesday. 
Industry sources Monday said Enron is considering withdrawing from the 
project because it doesn't believe it will be profitable.
Dolphin, an agreement signed two years ago by UOG and Qatar Petroleum, plans 
to bring 2 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore 
North Field to Abu Dhabi and onward to Dubai. 
Enron and TotalFinaElf (TOT) each hold a 24.5% stake in the project, while 
UOG owns the remaining 51%. 
Enron is set to focus on the midstream part of the project - gas 
transportation - which requires building a 350-kilometer pipeline from a 
processing plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar, to the Taweelah terminal in Abu Dhabi 
and the Jebel Ali terminal in Dubai. 
The U.A.E. source said originally, it was thought that the U.A.E. government 
would fund the pipeline, which is estimated to cost around $1 billion. 
However, more recently, the source said the U.A.E. suggested that Enron put 
up the money itself. 
Other industry sources said Enron and TotalFinaElf also had to pay 
significant fees to join the project. TotalFinaElf will
operate the upstream part of the project, which includes developing
natural gas reserves in two blocks of the North Field. First wells are 
scheduled to be drilled in the second half of 2001 and come onstream in 
2005. 

Last week, the Middle East Economic Survey reported that the foreign partners 
haven't yet agreed on the precise details of their working relationship or on 
the price of the pipeline. 
Qatar Petroleum and Dolphin Energy Ltd., a subsidiary of UOG, signed an 
initial agreement in March for the upstream section of the project. A full 
agreement is expected to be concluded in September, the source said.

Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2)

Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2)

     (Updates with closing share prices.)

     Washington, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. should sell
Portland General Electric Co. to Oregon so state consumers can be
insulated from soaring electricity prices, a congressman said.
     ``Purchasing PGE would give Oregon ratepayers more control by
keeping its assets in Oregon, accountable solely to Oregonians,''
U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat from Springfield,
Oregon, said in a letter to Governor John Kitzhaber.
     The governor is considering DeFazio's proposal, said
Kitzhaber spokesman Kevin Smith.
     Last month, Houston-based Enron, the biggest energy trader,
agreed to cancel the $3.1 billion sale of Portland General, a
utility with more than 700,000 Oregon customers, to Sierra Pacific
Resources of Reno, Nevada.
     Enron and Sierra Pacific blamed laws spawned by high power
prices and electricity shortages in the West for the sale's
collapse.
     ``We are pleased to keep Portland General in our asset
portfolio because it's a solid earnings performer,'' Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne said. ``If approached by a buyer who
recognizes its value, we'd consider selling it.'' She declined to
comment on a potential bid by Oregon.
     The state should act swiftly, DeFazio said, citing press
reports that the U.K.'s Scottish Power Plc, owner of PacifiCorp,
the largest utility in the U.S Northwest, may bid for Portland
General.
     Scottish Power, based in Glasgow, Scotland, would have more
than 70 percent of Oregon electricity customers if it added
Portland General, raising ``serious regulatory concerns about
market power,'' he said.

                            Bond Issue

     Oregon could issue bonds to purchase Portland General, using
the utility's profits to pay the debt, DeFazio said. The state
might run it as a public utility or a cooperative, he said.
     Enron and Sierra Pacific called off the Portland General sale
because of laws passed by Nevada and California legislators that
slow the deregulation of their wholesale power markets.
     California and Nevada have blocked sales of power plants by
utilities. Sierra Pacific had to sell a stake in a Nevada power
plant that sells power to California to win regulatory approval of
the Portland General purchase.
     Average power prices on the California-Oregon border this
year have soared ninefold to $296.34 a megawatt hour over the year-
earlier period. A megawatt hour can light 750 average California
homes for an hour.
     Shares of Enron fell $1.76 to $$56.99. They've fallen 31
percent this year.
     Sierra Pacific rose 9 cents to $16.09. Scottish Power rose 9
pence to 492 ($7) in London.



Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)
2001-05-15 16:26 (New York)

Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)

     (Adds closing share price.)

     Houston, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's
biggest energy trader, agreed to provide natural-gas pricing
information to NGX Canada Inc. and drop a C$100 million
($64.7 million) suit against the Canadian gas exchange.
     Enron sued NGX in November after the Internet exchange, a
unit of the company that owns the Stockholm Stock Exchange,
changed providers of its gas-pricing data and didn't include
trades on EnronOnline, Enron's Internet exchange, when calculating
gas-price indexes.
     Calgary-based NGX agreed to include EnronOnline trades in
calculating its Alberta Gas Price Indices by August, Enron
spokesman Eric Thode said.
     NGX, owned by Stockholm's OM Gruppen AB, is used by about 90
percent of Canadian gas traders, and many traders use EnronOnline
to sell gas from western Canada, the biggest supplier of the
cleaner-burning fuel to the U.S.
     Houston-based Enron fell $1.76 to $56.99.

Saudis Set to Select Firms for Gas Projects

NEW YORK -- After more than two years of talks, Saudi Arabia is about to 
announce its choice of international oil companies for three huge natural-gas 
projects that will mark a reopening of the kingdom's energy sector to Western 
investment, a quarter century after it was nationalized. 
But the announcement, and the signing of memorandums of understanding early 
next month, will mark only the beginning of serious negotiations on terms for 
the three ventures, which together will need investment of some $25 billion. 
It will be months before final agreements are signed.
"We expect to have an agreement -- a final agreement -- signed somewhere at 
the end of the year, or, hopefully, the first quarter of next year," said 
Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi in an interview last week. 
Saudi Arabia's 11-member Supreme Petroleum Council is expected to meet today 
to endorse the companies recommended by a ministerial committee led by 
Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal. In the following week, Saudi Arabia 
is expected to communicate its decision to the oil companies from both sides 
of the Atlantic that have been vying for a role in the three projects. By the 
end of the month, the chosen consortium members and Saudi officials are 
expected to agree on which three companies will lead the projects. This will 
be a prestigious role in a country that is the world's largest oil exporter, 
has more than a quarter of the world's oil reserves and has the fifth-largest 
reserves of natural gas. 
As with any negotiations for such huge projects, industry rumors abound. All 
three so-called oil supermajors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch/Shell Group 
and BP PLC -- have been mentioned as project leaders, particularly for the 
plum Ghawar project, named after the world's largest onshore oil field, whose 
environs are expected to yield large volumes of gas. The Ghawar project, 
known as Core Venture 1, is projected to require about $15 billion in 
investment. Core Venture 2 is on the Red Sea coast. The third project is in 
Shaybah, a recently developed oil field in the kingdom's Empty Quarter, a 
southeastern region bordering the United Arab Emirates. 
The companies say they have no idea who will be named to the consortia, or 
who the Saudis will choose from a short list of 11 companies -- Exxon Mobil, 
Shell, BP, Chevron Corp., TotalFinaElf SA, ENI SpA, Enron Corp., Occidental 
Petroleum Corp., Marathon Oil Canada Inc., Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum 
Corp. -- to lead each project. But they all have their hopes. 
"We would be very disappointed if we are not the lead operator" for the 
Shaybah project, said Archie Dunham, Conoco's chairman and chief executive. 
Since Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah invited major oil companies to return to 
the kingdom in October 1998, negotiations have focused on such broad issues 
as the scope of the projects and their integrated nature -- from exploration 
and production of gas to the making of petrochemicals and electricity -- as 
well as the notion that the companies will need adequate returns on their 
investment. 
Soon, the project leaders will have to start the bargaining on such issues as 
the roles to be played by national champions Aramco and petrochemicals 
company Saudi Basic Industries Corp.

Cheney task force seeks input from interest groups
By SHARON THEIMER

WASHINGTON (AP) - The White House team developing a national energy plan has 
met with more than 130 interest groups, from environmentalists and unions 
often at odds with Republicans to major Bush supporters given private 
sessions with Vice President Dick Cheney. 
The vice president, Cabinet secretaries and others on a special task force 
have solicited ideas behind closed doors, hoping the privacy would encourage 
a free exchange of ideas.
The White House has declined to provide names of participants - even to 
Congress. 
But interviews with participants detail a massive outreach where diverse 
interests have met with task force executive director Andrew Lundquist. 
Cheney's time has been reserved for meetings with more select participants 
such as power wholesaler Enron Corp. and the Edison Electric Institute, both 
GOP donors. 
Houston-based Enron is the world's top buyer and seller of natural gas and 
electricity. 
"The way the task force is set up, they don't have the staff or time to have 
a huge host of companies come through the door. They have told us to work 
through our associations to the extent we can," said Don Duncan, vice 
president of government relations for Phillips Petroleum Co. 
Participants said the meetings, typically 20 minutes to 45 minutes, included 
about a dozen to 100 interest group members and a few task force members and 
staff. 
No details were disclosed. Instead, administration representatives summarized 
the nation's energy problems or listened as groups briefly offered background 
and proposals. Many sent detailed materials to the task force outlining their 
priorities. 
At a half-hour meeting in late March with White House strategist Karl Rove 
and Bush economic adviser Larry Lindsey, nuclear energy executives tried to 
make sure the two knew about the production records the industry has set over 
the past few years. At one point, Rove asked if anyone was looking to build a 
nuclear power plant. An executive with Exelon replied that his company was 
thinking about it, meeting participants said. 
Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham has attended several meetings, including one 
with Teamsters President James Hoffa and an hourlong session in California 
with Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, who contends the administration has done 
little to help the power-strapped state. 
Like other governors, Davis was asked to provide one page on the state's 
power crisis, including a description of the problem, an anecdote about it 
and possible solutions. 
"They're asking for a one-page memo on possibly the biggest crisis ever 
affecting the state, with a massive ripple effect for the nation," Davis 
spokesman Steve Maviglio said. "I think it demands more attention than a 
one-page memo." 
Cheney spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss said the task force has been 
studying the California problem almost daily. 
At a meeting between Abraham and about 100 coal industry representatives in 
late April, task force staffers handed out a briefing packet that outlined 
national energy needs, and then they listened to industry proposals. 
"I thought the purpose was one, to reassure people in the coal industry that 
coal was going to play a large role in the energy mix, and essentially when 
the plan is unveiled that they're going to be looking to people to help 
martial this through Congress," said Bill Banig, a lobbyist for the United 
Mineworkers Union. 
White House officials said the meetings are not designed to encourage 
lobbying and that task force members were carefully instructed on what was 
permissible under federal law. 
Cheney's meetings included Enron, Edison Electric Institute, California 
Republicans, and the senators from Nevada, home to the proposed Yucca 
Mountain federal nuclear waste site. The vice president plans to meet with 
the renewable-energy industry this week. 
Enron ranked among Bush's top 10 presidential campaign contributors, giving 
more than $110,000, and helped sponsor a $7 million party fund-raiser last 
month. 
The Edison Electric Institute gave Republican candidates more than two-thirds 
of its $193,000 in contributions last year. Edison International, whose 
holdings include the Southern California Edison electric utility, is also a 
major donor, giving $535,000 to Republicans last year and $330,000 to 
Democrats. 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said Cheney met with Enron executives because the 
power wholesaler is a respected member of the industry, not because it was a 
contributor. Enron wants the administration's energy plan to ease electricity 
transmission bottlenecks, give companies incentives to invest in new 
transmission and make the wholesale power market as open as possible, he 
said. 
Tom Kuhn, the institute's president, said it is "totally ludicrous" to think 
political donations played a role. 
Cheney's meeting with Edison board members, held at the institute's 
invitation, lasted 15 minutes to 20 minutes. Cheney spoke about the task 
force process, Kuhn said. He said Cheney's remarks were consistent with the 
vice president's public statements. 
Edison wants to see new generation and transmission systems built, including 
coal, natural gas and nuclear and hydroelectric power, Kuhn said. 
Democrats in Congress sought a list of participants in the meetings, but 
Cheney's office responded by only listing broad categories and no names. That 
has left fodder for political attack. 
"You can't just take advice from one interest group or set of interest groups 
when you do these things," said Dave Albersworth of the Wilderness Society, 
whose group has met with Lundquist but was denied its request to talk with 
Cheney. 
Weiss countered that the energy task force has collected information from 
more than 130 groups since January in an "almost Herculean effort" to draw 
input from all sides. 
"People deserve the right to petition their government and not expect a full 
laundry list of who's called to be announced," she said. 
Enron spokesman Palmer said he is not seeking such privacy. "I'm happy to 
tell people what we're advocating for. I'd rather be talking about policy 
than about politics," he said.

		COMPANIES & FINANCE UK: Independents drill deep to strike rich seams: A new 
generation of smaller oil companies is emerging; a group that has discovered 
how to be competitive, writes David Buchan: Financial Times; May 14, 2001
By DAVID BUCHAN

		The UK's listed small oil companies may have dwindled in number. But they can 
rightly say, echoing Mark Twain's words, that reports of their collective 
demise are exaggerated. 
		Indeed, many in the UK-based exploration and production companies, dubbed 
"independents" in the sense of being untied to any refining and marketing, 
believe they have more of a role than when their kind first started operating 
in the North Sea 30 years ago. 
		After the takeovers in recent years of Lasmo, Monument and British Borneo, 
there may only be about a dozen significant UK-based "independents" left. Yet 
they amount to virtually the entire European E&P sector: the only significant 
exception being Lundin Oil of Sweden. 
		Many of the UK independents began life as local partners of US companies in 
the 1970s when the Labour government of the period gave preference to 
consortia with a local flavour. 
		But this rationale disappeared when the Thatcher government took a more 
free-for-all approach to letting anyone develop the North Sea - though at the 
same time it did create the biggest UK independent by floating off British 
Gas' oil interests as Enterprise Oil. Enterprise is the only UK independent 
that is more than a niche or regional player. As such its E&P assets would be 
a significant addition to an oil major, hence the persistently rumoured 
interest in taking it over. 
		As the North Sea became more competitive and difficult, some of the UK-based 
independents began to look elsewhere. "Unlike US independents which have 
always tended to be less interested in drilling outside North America, those 
in the UK have always tended to be more sympathetic to exotic parts of the 
world", says Mark Redway of Teather and Greenwood. 
		Unfortunately, the obvious exotic new province that happened to open up in 
the early 1990s was the former Soviet Union. One company, Ramco Energy, 
dipped in and out very successfully, recently selling its 2 per cent stake in 
the Azerbaijan International Oil Consortium for Dollars 150m (Pounds 104.8m). 
		Other UK independents - Aminex, Soco and Dana Petroleum - ventured into 
Russia and got stuck. While Aminex finds it hard to downplay Russia (because 
it has little elsewhere), Soco these days stresses its Mongolia and Vietnam 
operations. Another UK independent, JKX Oil & Gas, went into Ukraine, a 
country notorious for non-payment of energy bills. With diplomatic help from 
Tony Blair, the prime minister, JKX has just survived a legal attempt to rob 
it of its Ukraine assets. 
		Two other independents have sunk more fruitful roots in Asia. "Cairn Energy 
now has as big a stake in Bangladesh's gas production as Shell, and it would 
be left, if Enron (the US energy company) were to quit India, as the biggest 
foreign player in India," says Iain Reid of UBS Warburg. Premier Oil is now a 
substantial Asian gas company, with production in Burma, Indonesia and 
Pakistan and long term contracts in Thailand and Singapore. 
		But there are risks in these Asian ties. The obvious political one concerns 
Burma. Last year the UK government asked Premier to quit Burma because its 
presence was helping the military regime. Premier refused, and said it would 
carry on. 
		The other risk, according to Mr Redway, is economic and it applies also to 
Cairn. Because there is no real world market for gas, Cairn and Premier are 
"very dependent on the strength of the local economies". But then, Mr Redway 
is an analyst who believes that independents' competitive edge lies in 
exploration rather than production. He therefore rates Fusion Oil & Gas 
highly as "the purest exploration investment opportunity in the E&P sector". 
		Dana similarly vaunts its exploration expertise, but to a different end. Its 
goal, according to Tom Cross, chief executive, is to find oil and then swap 
exploration for production assets. "This avoids the expensive development 
stage of building platforms and pipelines and so on". Then at the other end 
of the spectrum are production-focused companies, such as Paladin, Tullow Oil 
or Venture Production. Roy Franklin, Paladin's chief executive, makes no 
bones about his company's scavenger strategy, spotting rich pickings 
overlooked by the majors. 
		The majors are not always ready to sell, particularly recently when the oil 
price rise has widened the gap in price expectations between buyers and 
sellers. 
		But Paladin was last year able to buy PetroCanada's assets in Norway, and is 
this year interested in bidding for some of what the Norwegian state is 
selling off. 
		As its name suggests, Venture Production, a private Aberdeen-based company 
with North Sea and Trinidad operations, is focused on extraction, not 
exploration. And so are other private companies such as Intrepid, Consort 
Energy and Highland Energy, formed in the past three or four years. This new 
generation of company tends to be more cautious than the older one. 
"Exploration has probably been the best way to destroy shareholder value," 
says one executive. 
		The other risk the new oilmen want to avoid is the vagaries of the stock 
market. "By focusing on production, the new companies are more predictable in 
terms of cash flow and earnings," says Mike Wagstaff, Venture's finance 
director.

QATAR: UAE's Dolphin may seek new partners if Enron exits.
By Kedar Sharma

05/14/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

DOHA, May 14 (Reuters) - Dolphin Energy Ltd (DEL) may invite new foreign 
investors to join its project to route Qatari gas to the United Arab Emirates 
as U.S. Enron Corp looks set to bow out, industry sources said on Monday. 
"New partners are a possibility," Khaldoun al-Mubarak, project manager for 
DEL, majority owned by the UAE's Offsets Group (UOG), told Reuters.
"But at the moment we are in the midst of finalising the formal (development 
and production sharing) agreement with Qatar which should be done by 
September at the latest." 
Qatar and DEL in March signed a "commercial term sheet agreement" which 
outlined the conditions of the upstream agreement for the long-awaited $3.5 
billion project. 
UOG currently owns 51 percent of DEL, with the remainder held equally by 
France's TotalFinaElf and Enron. 
"Enron is going through major global restructuring," Mubarak said. "(But) 
they haven't officially notified us about their intention to pull out." 
Enron officials declined comment. 
Mubarak said interest in DEL was running high. 
"Everyone is asking for a stake," he said. 
The gas deal would entitle DEL to develop a tract of Qatar's giant North 
Field and produce up to two billion cubic feet per day (cfd) of gas. 
UOG is to invest $2 billion in developing the North Field tract, drilling and 
setting up production facilities. 
The remaining $1.5 billion would be invested to lay a pipeline and set up 
receiving terminals at Dubai's Jebel Ali and Taweelah in Abu Dhabi. 
First gas is targeted to reach the UAE capital Abu Dhabi by late 2004 or 
early 2005. About one billion to 1.5 billion cfd of Qatari gas would be 
consumed by utilities in Abu Dhabi with the remainder supplied to Dubai.

UAE: UPDATE 1-Saudi expected to name gas race winners on Tuesday.
By Peg Mackey

05/14/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

DUBAI, May 14 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) is 
expected to meet on Tuesday and announce the oil majors chosen for its 
multi-billion dollar gas investment opening, industry sources familiar with 
the negotiations said on Monday. 
The sources said the SPC is expected to name ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell 
as lead players in three so-called core projects involving the kingdom's 
upstream gas sector - off-limits to foreign oil firms since nationalisation 
in 1975.
Signing of memoranda of understanding (MOUs) would most probably take place 
in early June, the sources said. 
The anticipated announcement would mark the biggest advance in the kingdom's 
gas initiative, valued at an initial $25 billion, since Riyadh unveiled its 
energy investment opening over two years ago. 
But the hard work has yet to start on the opening of Saudi Arabia's gas 
sector, the world's fourth biggest. "The fiscal regime and regulatory details 
have not been developed," said one source. 
FINAL CUT 
Riyadh is expected to trim back its original shortlist of 11 potential 
foreign investors revealed last summer. Those companies had been grouped 
under three core venture consortia - South Ghawar, Red Sea and Shaybah. 
For ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell, securing the lead role in Saudi 
Arabia's core ventures would entitle them to operate the package and get the 
biggest slice of the projects, analysts said. 
Other industry sources said ExxonMobil, the world's biggest energy company, 
was tipped for the top slot in core venture 1 (South Ghawar) as well as in 
core venture 2 (Red Sea). 
Royal Dutch/Shell was in pole position for core venture 3 (Shaybah), the 
sources added. 
Both oil supermajors already have significant foreign investment in the 
kingdom and feature as top customers of Saudi oil, the analysts said. 
ENERGY DRIVERS 
An urgent need to create jobs and grow the economy are driving Saudi Arabia's 
landmark energy opening. 
And analysts said big oil companies were prepared to help the kingdom achieve 
those aims even if the return on their investment was relatively low. 
"Major oil companies just cannot miss this opportunity," a source said. "The 
gas projects will show profits." 
But just how much revenue oil companies will generate by selling water and 
electricity in the Saudi domestic market remains to be seen. 
On paper, at least, the kingdom's domestic gas sector looks set for 
impressive growth. 
Domestic gas demand, now running at about 3.4 billion cubic feet per day, is 
forecast to grow at more than seven percent a year over the coming decade. 
Saudi Arabia has meanwhile made clear that its prized oil sector, the world's 
biggest, remains off limits. 
Even so, oil companies still hold out hope for eventual involvement in oil, 
the kingdom's lifeblood. 
"The companies are just as happy with gas, but oil remains the ultimate 
objective," a regional analyst said. 
"Saudi Aramco is still putting up strong defence barriers, but eventually 
they could open up the oil sector once they feel comfortable working with the 
majors." 
The Saudi gas initiative seeks foreign oil companies' help in developing the 
kingdom's known gas reserves as well as investment in downstream projects fed 
by gas supplies, such as power and desalination. 
The following companies have been shortlisted for the gas projects: 
Core venture 1 (South Ghawar Area) - ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, BP , 
TotalFinaElf , Chevron and ENI . 
Core venture 2 (Red Sea Area) - TotalFinaElf, ExxonMobil, Marathon , Enron
/Oxy , Conoco , Royal Dutch/Shell. 
Core venture 3 (Shaybah Area) - Royal Dutch/Shell, ExxonMobil, Marathon, 
Conoco, TotalFinaElf, Phillips and Enron/Oxy.

Saudi Oil Council To Meet Tue On Gas Projects -Sources

Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- International oil companies vying for a stake in Saudi 
Arabia's downstream gas projects, expect to be notified soon on whether they 
have been selected to participate, industry sources in the kingdom said 
Monday. 
Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council is set to meet Tuesday and shortly 
after, announce its final selection for each of the three core ventures on 
offer, the sources said.
The Saudi Arabian committee negotiating with international oil companies on 
the Gas Initiative, submitted its proposals for consortium members and 
leaders to the country's Ministerial Council in April. These were then passed 
on to the SPC for final approval. 
Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah, who heads the SPC, is in Bahrain Monday 
attending a Gulf Cooperation Council leaders' summit along with Saudi 
Arabia's foreign minister, Saud Al Faisal, who heads the gas negotiating 
committee. 
Saudi Arabia invited international oil companies in October 1998 to 
participate in proposals for downstream gas projects and upstream gas 
enhancement. 
After a series of meetings between the negotiating committee and IOC's in the 
past year, the following companies were shortlisted for each project. 
Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD), BP PLC (BP), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Chevron 
Corp. (CHV), Total Fina Elf S.A. (TOT) and ENI SpA (E) for Core Venture 1, 
the $15 billion South Ghawar Area Development. 
For Core Venture 2, the Red Sea Development, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Occidental 
Petroleum Corp. (OXY) are bidding jointly and Exxon Mobil, Total Fina Elf, 
Marathon Oil Canada Inc. (T.M), Shell and Conoco Inc. (COCA) were listed. 
And for Core Venture 3, the Shaybah area, Total Fina Elf, Conoco, Phillips 
Petroleum (P), Enron and Occidental, Exxon Mobil, Shell and Marathon Oil were 
listed. 

With all those shortlisted expected to play some role, the immediate and 
essential question for each of the IOC's is whether they will be selected to 
lead and operate a project, with Core Venture 1 the most sought after, 
industry sources said. 
Exxon Mobil and Shell have been tipped as frontrunners for this venture. 
The operator's role will be more crucial than ever here as it will be 
responsible for directing further negotiations on the projects at hand which 
will lead to final deals probably by year end. 
Also, operators are expected to decide and direct how the project's 
individual and large components will be developed, details the Saudis haven't 
finalized, sources said. 
The three ventures have been estimated at a combined value of about $25 
billion.

Business
RFID chip will help speed up business

05/14/2001
The New Straits Times
Main/Lifestyle; 2*

(Copyright 2001)

THE combination of recently developed "stick-on" Radio Frequency 
Identification (RFID) chip technology with a global positioning system (GSP) 
will transform and quicken the pace of doing business in the oil and gas 
industry. 
And Malaysia must adapt to this shift to maintain her global positioning.
Global management and technology consultant Global Energy Strategy Practice 
which is working in partnership with Accenture Sdn Bhd wants to promote this 
idea locally. 
Global Energy Strategy Practice partner Paul Spence said that applying this 
latest combined technology, car owners can fill up a petrol tank without 
resorting to human contact or to the use of a credit card. 
Relevant personal data embedded in the RFID chip would be machine read and 
the required quantity of petrol delivered, as if right out of a science 
fiction movie. 
This surreal development is made possible through the application of 
ubiquitous-commerce (u-commerce) whereby computers and machines communicate 
with each other to affect an impression of an omnipresent intelligence. 
Such technology is economically available today. "There are technology 
suppliers who are offering these capabilities." 
The technology also has applications outside the oil and gas industry. 
Communications between machines can now allow or deny access of individuals 
to restricted zones. 
In an interview in Petaling Jaya recently, Spence said: "A lot of my clients 
now are asking, whether that same technology can be used to restrict access 
into hazardous areas, plants or production sites. 
"Can a warning alarm be fitted to the individual or to an assistant? There 
are lots of safety, health and environment applications around that." 
"Guru in the field" is another potential application where a combination of 
RFID chips, video cameras, personal digital assistants (PDA) and personal 
computers can deliver distant technical advice on- site. 
"An industry client operating in the North Sea oil fields has a prototype 
mounted on a workman's helmet which sends snap-shots to experts on the other 
side of the world. 
"The effect of this new combined technology on global financial and commodity 
markets is to lock them in tighter correlation. 
"The days of being able to arbitrage for profits between geographical markets 
are shortening within the energy industry. Enron which is the biggest oil 
trader in the US is now hedging on weather derivatives." 
Accenture partner Lim Beng Choon said that to compete globally, the oil and 
gas industry in Malaysia would have to implement this new technology to 
remain connected to global markets.

India: Godbole panel report may suggest MSEB bifurcation

Asia Intelligence Wire

MUMBAI, May 13. THE second part of the Dr Madhav Godbole committee report is 
expected to be submitted to the State Government on May 15. 
While the first part of the report recommended renegotiation of the power 
purchase agreement with Enron's Dabhol Power Company, the second part is 
expected to suggest bifurcation of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, 
sources said. The committee, which has been given the mandate to negotiate 
with Enron officials to make DPC power more acceptable, had a marathon 
meeting on May 11 to finalise the second half of the report.
"The committee has been considering the bifurcation of MSEB," a source said. 
"The idea is to try and separate the distribution from generation and 
transmission." While generation and transmission can be controlled by the 
State, there may be a suggestion to privatise the distribution arm. Over 1.5 
lakh MSEB employees had gone on a strike to oppose a Bill to unbundle the 
board into three divisions - generation, transmission and distribution - due 
to fear of privatisation. 
MSEB, the State's leading power company, has been facing huge losses due to 
delay in payments and theft of power. The second part of the report is 
expected to address the problem in detail. 
Part one of the report submitted on April 10 had said: "...none of the 
solutions espoused for independent power producers, in general, and DPC, in 
particular, is tenable without the reforms of MSEB, especially its 
distribution business, which it shall address in part II of the report." 
The report is expected to "suggest appropriate measures to ensure that the 
interests of the State, MSEB and electricity consumers of the State of 
Maharashtra are properly and adequately considered, evaluated and 
safeguarded," according to the terms of reference laid down when forming the 
committee. 
The committee originally consisted of Dr Madhav Godbole, Mr Deepak Parekh, Dr 
E.A.S. Sarma, Dr Rajendra Pachauri and the State Energy Secretary, Mr Vinay 
Mohan Lal. The MSEB Chairman, Mr Vinay Bansal, has been inducted as part of 
the panel after the submission of the first part and before the beginning of 
negotiations with Enron.

These are volatile times for world business. There are increasing jitters 
that a slowing US economy could dampen prospects for the global economies. 
Many developing regions, especially in Asia, are bracing themselves for a 
bout of slightly lower growth. 
But two countries, India and China which together account for about half the 
region's gross domestic product (GDP_ will still continue to see their GDP 
grow at six per cent, forecasts the Asian Development Bank.
Many Indian economists agree with ADB's projections. In fact, they view the 
prediction of a six per cent growth in India's GDP as benign. Nearly 54 per 
cent of India's GDP is delivered by its services sector and a modest 
performance by this sector, some economists say, will be enough to hold up 
the GDP at six per cent. There are others who hope that better agricultural 
performance could prompt the economy to hand in a better scorecard. 
However, the Indian industry remains trapped in the doldrums, suffering from 
a lack of consumer confidence and investments. Very few economists expect to 
see signs of recovery sprouting any time soon. 
An interest rate cut is considered vital by many to energise the sector. And, 
they argue, there are certain economic indicators that encourage such a move. 
Inflation is running at very low levels and the nation's foreign exchange 
reserves are currently high enough to provide a strong defence to the Indian 
currency. Surprisingly, our trade balance, which threatened to spiral out of 
control by surging oil prices last year, has been contained. Since then, oil 
prices have retreated and are expected to remain subdued. While a rate cut 
may go some way in reviving sentiment and activity in the industrial sector, 
stirring up consumer demand will still hinge on a normal monsoon. 
Rain, rain, come again 
For many economists, the prediction of India clinging to its current GDP 
level is heavily contingent on a normal spell of monsoon this year. 
"According to our assessment, we believe the Indian economy will grow by 
around 6.5 per cent this fiscal year," says Chetan Ahya, vice president at J 
M Morgan Stanley Securities. 
In 2000-01, agricultural growth withered under a poor monsoon and a 
subsequent drought in many parts of the country. For the second year in a 
row, growth in the sector sank below one per cent. It stood at 0.9 per cent 
compared with 0.7 per cent the previous year. While agriculture accounts for 
only 24 per cent of GDP, it remains the most keenly-watched sector by 
economists. "The performance of the agricultural sector is important because 
of its linkages to the economy both on the supply side and on the consumption 
side," says Mohan Nagarajan, chief economist at Credit Analysis and Research 
Ltd (CARE). "It would lead to a better performance of agro-based industries," 
he adds. 
More significantly, roughly 60 per cent of Indians still depend on 
agriculture for their livelihood. "A good crop means that demand for 
everything, from everyday use goods like toothpaste to larger items like 
tractors will pick up," says Nagarajan. Economists are hoping that a good 
monsoon will budge growth in the sector to around 1.5 to 2.5 per cent. 
In service of the economy 
Another key sector economists will be watching out for will be services. 
India's services sector ranging from finance, insurance, hospitality to 
transportation and communication slowed its pace in 2000-01. With growth 
weakening by a whole per cent to 8.4 in 2000-01, sluggishness in this 
important sector has been blamed for dragging down the overall GDP. Most 
economists expect the sector to post either relatively flat growth or edge 
slightly higher this year. But, it's performance will be vital to ensure that 
overall GDP holds at six per cent. "Even if the agriculture and industry 
numbers fall again but services sees even seven to eight per cent growth, it 
will be enough to keep the GDP around six per cent," says Nagarajan. 
Construction activity a services component that includes housing, roads and 
other infrastructure projects demonstrated surprisingly good growth of 8.7 
per cent and is expected to maintain the pace. Road construction is tipped to 
show increasing levels of activity as work on the ambitious highway linking 
Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Calcutta intensifies. 
Chiming in will be the housing industry, benefiting in recent years from tax 
reliefs and attractive financing schemes, and which have encouraged more 
people to buy houses. 
Another segment slated to witness good growth will be IT-enabled services, 
says Morgan Stanley's Ahya. "We are emerging as the services workshop of the 
world," he says. IT-enabled services like call centres and data processing, 
though currently generating tiny revenues, are slated to turn into big money 
spinners in the years ahead. 
The telecommunications industry will also see improving levels of investment. 
"The penetration of services is so low, that it has an intrinsic high growth 
rate," says Ahya. For a taste of the market, consider this: out of the 100 
Indians, only one uses the Internet and less than three own a telephone. 
A good home show 
And there could be a pleasant surprise in store for industry amid all the 
gloom over its performance. 
Adequate liquidity conditions are spurring expectations of a cut in interest 
rates. Broad money(M3) a gauge of total money available in the economy 
increased 16.2 per cent in 2000-01 against 14.6 per cent last year. 
While the Reserve Bank of India had cut the bank rate in March, the belief is 
that a further cut of 50 basis points is imminent. The bank rate the rate at 
which the central bank lends to commercial banks currently stands at seven 
per cent. Aiding the cause is the inflation data which shows the wholesale 
price index at a tame 5.84 per cent. With economists betting that oil prices 
will remain in the $24-28 a barrel range, inflation is not expected to 
exhibit the oil price-inspired gyrations of last year. A cut could coax the 
industry to step up activity, though admittedly, much would still depend on 
rural demand. 
Neighbours' envy 
And while many Asian countries watch with increasing nervousness the impact 
of an American downturn on their economies, India and China can afford to 
remain relatively placid about global developments. That's because they are 
less dependent on the US for their own economic health. That is expected to 
shield them somewhat from being blown off-course like some other Asian 
nations by the ill-wind of an American slump in demand. 
With exports making up less than 10 per cent of India's GDP, its economy is 
clearly not export-driven. In contrast, nearly 35 per cent of Indonesia's GDP 
comes from exports, 57 per cent for Thailand, and 50 per cent for the 
Philippines. 
Yet, despite claiming only a small percentage of GDP, India's exports 
remained a bright spot amid some gloomy economic data. Exports raced ahead 20 
per cent to $44.1 billion in 2000-01. It was the second consecutive year of 
good exports growth. On the flip side, imports rose, too, during the same 
period to Rs $49.1 billion. But non-oil imports, however, declined 15 per 
cent to $34.2 billion. That helped narrow the trade gap to $5.74 billion from 
$12.79 billion the previous year. 
Still, India can ill-afford to ignore completely the risks of an American 
slump in demand. The US is India's largest trading partner and, in 2000-01, a 
quarter of its exports headed to that nation. Besides, by taking in nearly 70 
per cent of India's software exports, it is also India's most important 
software exports destination. 
Booming software exports accompanied by remittances by Indians living 
overseas have been the primary factors exerting a calming influence on 
India's balance of payments of position, especially in times of economic 
turbulence. For example, last year, while a surging oil import bill 
threatened to rattle the nation's trade gap, inflows from 
invisibles(including income from software and Indians living abroad) came to 
the rescue helping India limit its overall current account deficit. 
It's a sobering realisation that has compelled the National Association of 
Software and Service Companies(NASSCOM) to lower its exports forecast to 
between $8.5 billion to $9 billion from its previous figure of $9.5 billion. 
Earlier, it had also revised estimates for 2000-01 lower to $6.2 billion from 
$6.3 billion. Still, observers say it isn't a cause for depression. 
"They are still talking about growth. It is a decline in the growth rate and 
not an actual downturn itself," points out John Band, chief executive 
officer, ASK-Raymond James and Associates. And remittances look set to 
maintain their pace as well. "Most remittances are still from Indians who 
live in the Middle East, and I don't see any slowdown from this segment," 
says CARE's Nagarajan. Remittances totalled $9.8 billion in the nine months 
to December 2000. Software exports brought in $4.6 billion during the same 
period. 
Foreign institutions support 
Another recent 'feel-good' sign has been evident in the stock markets too. 
Between January and April 2001, eigners poured in Rs 7,368 crore into India's 
equity markets - a phenomenal 15 per cent more than what they invested in the 
whole of calendar 2000. 
Yet, experts aren't reading too much into it. In the past few months, 
investors have been fleeing from a shower of profit warnings in the US and 
seeking cover in alternative investments. As they rejuggle their portfolios, 
some money will inevitably flow into India and other countries, experts say. 
Because it isn't affected so much by what's happening externally, they see 
India as some kind of a safe haven," says ASK's Band. 
Yet some hesitation 
Recently, gunning for more foreign direct investments (FDI), the government 
opened more sectors for foreign and private participation, including 
pharmaceuticals, hotels, banking and astonishingly, even defence. However, 
tempting FDI has always been a vexing issue for India. 
In 2000-01, FDI did improve slightly, moving 26 per cent higher than the 
previous year to $2.4 billion. Yet, China a market India is frequently 
compared with in terms of size and potential attracted 20 times more FDI in 
the same period. Economists now shrug off FDI as a tool to kick-start 
investment in the country. "It's a pittance and it probably will remain 
stagnant," says an economist at a foreign research house. 
The reasons are not hard to find. Foreigners seeking to invest in India have 
many fences to cross. Frequent changes in sector policies, chaotic 
infrastructure facilities and nightmarish bureaucratic redtape have often 
left foreigners tired and wary of doing business in India. 
The stress of investing in India is most clearly visible in the recurring 
concerns that have stubbornly dogged US energy giant Enron's 2,148 MW power 
project in Dabhol in Maharashtra. After being forced to renegotiate a power 
supply deal in 1995 after concluding it in 1992, Enron has hit the headlines 
once again. 
This time, an almost bankrupt state electricity board (SEB) refuses to pay 
its dues for power received and the state government refuses to honour its 
commitment to pay in case the SEB defaults.It's led to intense speculation 
that, after suffering repeated snags for nearly a decade, Enron might simply 
pull out of the project altogether. A disturbing turn of events, since, till 
recently, Enron Corp was the biggest foreign investor in India. 
It will not be the first time that exasperation will have egged on a foreign 
investor to pull out of a project. Earlier, US-based Cogentrix Energy had 
also walked out of its $1.5 billion 1,000 MW Mangalore power project citing 
endless bureaucratic hurdles. 
And there has also been some disappointment over India's much-hyped 300 
million middle class which was supposed to be growing rapidly. Many 
international firms, inspired by this figure, had scrambled to set up 
operations to conquer a huge chunk of this market. Now many are struggling to 
break even and still learning to adapt to local tastes a key ingredient for 
success. That's why despite all its attempts to open up various sectors, 
India still remains a tough sell. 
Outlook 
With a little help from the rains, India could notch up a growth rate of six 
per cent. Many economists have also pointed out that a reforms-studded budget 
could also inject some enthusiasm in the patient that is the economy. Strong 
measures include plans to reform labour laws and government employment. These 
are expected to boost the economy's development, though in the long run. 
The recent opening up of various sectors could also revive sentiment, 
although whether this will translate into FDI flows is arguable. Still, every 
bit helps. The fact remains that it will have to persist in trying to 
accelerate the pace of growth if its ambitions of turning into an economic 
powerhouse are to be realised. After all, for the second most populous nation 
in the world with one of the biggest markets, its economic power is still 
nowhere near the figure its size suggests.

Italian brokers Rasfin SIM have indicated the potential for growth in the 
shares of Acegas, the former municipal utility of the Italian city of 
Trieste. Acegas closed the first quarter of this year with turnover of L137bn 
(+45 per cent). Results attributed in part to the start of production of 
Estenergy, a consortium of the utilities of Udine, Trieste, Gorizia and Enron 
of the US, which supplies energy and services to parts of Friuli. 
Also significant, according to Rasfin, were investments over the period, 
which totalled L43bn.

Sometimes even Cabinet officers can lose their way in the White House. So 
there was Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson, clearly lost 
Friday at a fork in a corridor near White House spokesman Ari Fleischer's 
office. 
"How do you get to the Oval Office?" he asked a group of reporters and was 
directed to the right door, according to a wire report.
Fleischer, though, told reporters that was the wrong answer. 
"How do you get to the Oval Office? First you win the Iowa caucus, then you 
lose the New Hampshire primary, then you make a comeback in South Carolina," 
he quipped as he recalled President Bush's early primary campaign last year. 
Passport, Please 
Meanwhile, folks at Thompson's HHS may be taking to calling him "Tightwad 
Tommy." Seems a memo went out March 15 undermining Alaska and Hawaii's claims 
to be part of the United States. 
Employees "must clear . . . international travel" with the office of the 
deputy chief of staff for operations, said the memo from the deputy chief, Ed 
Sontag. To clarify, "HHS employees seeking to travel outside the continental 
U.S." for meetings and conferences, must get permission and then file trip 
reports within two weeks. 
This sent officials calling around, asking whether trips to those states were 
to go through the international travel approval system just as if they were 
going to Russia or the Congo. 
Apparently so. The edict would appear to include even the nearby Virgin 
Islands and practically next-door Puerto Rico as well. Loop Fans can only 
hope this outrage doesn't spread to other agencies. It would make for some 
cold winters. 
Chewing Out on the Bush Beat 
Speaking of Fleischer, the usually affable spokesman is not reluctant to get 
tough with reporters when he believes they've stepped out of line. 
Sheriff Fleischer was on duty Thursday and upset with Houston Chronicle 
reporter Bennett Roth. Bush that morning urged parents to talk more to their 
kids about the dangers of drugs. 
Roth, at Fleischer's daily briefing, asked: "Ari, the president talked about 
parental involvement today. How much has he talked to his own daughters about 
both drugs and drinking? And given the fact that his own daughter was cited 
for underage drinking, isn't that a sign that there's only so much effect 
that a parent can have on their children's behavior?" 
Fleischer responded brusquely: "No, I think, frankly, there are some issues 
where I think it's very important for you all in the press corps to recognize 
that he is the president of the United States; he's also a father. And the 
press corps has been very respectful in the past of treating family matters 
with privacy, and I'm certain that you're going to do so again. I hope so." 
Fleischer later called Roth to chastise him, telling him his question had 
been "noted in the building." 
Competing to Oversee the Corps 
Former Mississippi representative Mike Parker, a Democrat-turned-Republican 
who lost a gubernatorial bid a couple of years back, had been seen as the 
pick to be assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, overseeing the 
Army Corps of Engineers. 
Parker, a former undertaker, had support from the barge industry, the various 
corps constituencies and fellow Mississippian Trent Lott, the majority leader 
of the Senate. 
But the Pentagon's choice was Lawrence Izzo, recently retired president of 
Enron Engineering and Construction Co. who has been in the mix for several 
jobs. Izzo, a West Point grad, had 23 years at the Corps before going to 
Enron, former home of Army secretary-designate Thomas White. 
The majority leader was said to be most unhappy. The latest word is Parker's 
getting the job. 
Ex-Reporters Move On 
Kenneth J. Klein, a former reporter who has worked for 17 years for Florida 
Sen. Bob Graham (D), most recently as chief of staff, is joining the Outdoor 
Advertising Association of America as executive vice president for government 
relations. 
Former Washington Post colleague Thomas W. Lippman, a 33-year national, 
foreign and financial reporter and author who became vice president of 
communications at the World Wildlife Fund in 1999, is moving next month to be 
managing director at communications consulting firm Chlopak, Leonard, 
Schechter & Associates.

The largest-ever International Conference and Exhibition on liquefied natural 
gas (LNG 13) opens today for a four-day run at the Convention and Exhibition 
Center (COEX) in southern Seoul. 
A total of 125 companies and organizations represented by 2,500 delegates and 
exhibitors from 50-odd countries, including Japan, the United States, Britain 
and Australia, are participating in the international event, co- organized by 
the Korea Gas Union and the Korea Gas Corp. (KOGAS).
Commerce, Industry and Energy Minister Chang Che-shik will be delivering 
congratulatory remarks on behalf of Prime Minister Lee Han-dong who is 
currently on an official trip to the Middle East. There will be a visual 
presentation from Lee during the opening ceremony. 
``We have spent more than a year preparing for this international event which 
is the largest in terms of the number of participants and exhibitors,'' said 
Lee Seung-hwan, chairman of the Korean National Organizing Committee. 
LNG 13 is 15 percent larger than the conference and exhibition held in 
Australia back in 1998 which reflects the growth of the industry, Lee 
explained, adding that the demand for LNG has been increasing rapidly here in 
Korea. 
A wide range of topics will be presented during the four days of conferences 
and exhibitions, helping to showcase the importance of the LNG industry. 
Among the numerous papers to be presented at the triennial event are ``Old 
World, New World, Tomorrow's World: How LNG Has Changed Since LNG 12'' and 
``The Next Generation of LNG Plants.'' 
``Hosting this meaningful event in Korea will help elevate Korea's image in 
the international market, particularly with the sheer scale and size of LNG 
13,'' said Kim Myung-kyu, president and CEO of KOGAS and chairman of the 
Korea gas Union. 
The conference will include paper sessions, workshops, poster sessions and 
film presentations while exhibitors will demonstrate their exclusive 
technologies for the exploration and production of LNG as well as plant 
construction. 
The official sponsors of LNG 13 are the International Gas Union, the Gas 
Technology Institute and the International institute of Refrigeration while 
the major sponsors are Shell Gas and Power, KOGAS, LG-Caltex, SK-Enron, the 
Qatari Group, TotalFinaElf, British Petroleum and Exxon Mobile. 
In addition to the conference and exhibition, there will be a technical visit 
to the Inchon LNG Receiving Terminal in Inchon, about 50 kilometers west of 
Seoul, on Friday.

John,

You might recall we spoke a few weeks ago about a system with more 
intelligence for out-of-hours trading than just leaving the products on Last 
Trade is Mid.

Attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work. It builds on 
Offset to Last Trade functionality.

The simplified description is: It tracks two variables: Intensity(Speed) and 
Bias (Buy or Sell emphasis).  As Intensity increases, the Spread increases. 
As Bias increases, the Offset increases.

I'll call later to see what you think of the idea.

Dave

 

Program Criteria

The formula which defines the trading decision-making program will need to 
work with several criteria/inputs/definitions. These might be:

Intensity (Speed) - The average time between transaction attempts, regardless 
of whether they are buys or sells. Measured as a moving average over the last 
[Intensity Factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction 
Tibco messages for the Product.
Obviously, the lower the Intensity calculation, the higher the transaction 
flow. Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow.
Intensity Factor - The number of transactions to be included in the moving 
average Intensity calculation. A possible value for this might be [4].
#Buys - The number of Buys which have occurred.
#Sells - The number of Sells which have occured.
Transaction Count - Could be either #Buys or #Sells (whichever last occured).}
Buy Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs.
Sell Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs.
Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR)- The amount by which the Buy Offset should be 
reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy 
occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the 
ORR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be 1.
Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR)- The amount by which #Buys should be 
reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount #Sells should be reduced if a Buy 
occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the 
TRR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal 
to 1.
Spread Minimum - The minimum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this 
might be [0.04]
Spread Maximum - The maximum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this 
might be [0.50]
Offset Minimum - The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A 
possible value for this might be [0].
Offset Maximum -The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A 
possible value for this might be [0.50]
Initial Offset - The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started
Initial Spread - The Spread used when the program is started
Spread-Offset Minimum - The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed 
Offset. Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer. A 
possible value for this might be [0.01]
Dead Interval - The period of time which must pass before the program will 
recalculate the above Criteria, if no transactions have taken place during 
the Dead Interval. A possible value for this might be [240] seconds.

Program Outputs

The program should output the following variables as a result of combining 
the above Criteria in a user-defined Formula:

Spread (integer) - as per current Stack Manager
Offset (integer) - as per current Stack Manager
Suspension (boolean) - Whether or not the Product should be suspended. 
Normally "False"


Program Interface and Operation Principles

The user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a 
relationship among the above Criteria, which will produce and apply the 
Outputs to a particular Product. This relationship would be defined with 
Intensity Formulas and Transaction Formulas. 

Every time a Transaction occurs, or a Dead Interval passes, the Criteria will 
be recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the 
program. If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place, 
then Intensity = Intensity +240 and #Buys=#Buys-TRR and #Sells=#Sells-TRR and 
Buy Offset = Buy Offset- ORR and Sell Offset = Sell Offset - ORR. 

If the user-defined Formulas (see following) indicate that a change in spread 
should occur, then if the Offset is zero (in the case of a trade occurring) 
or if no trade has occured (during the passing of a Dead Interval), the 
system shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last 
transaction, adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread 
value.

Any adjustment to the Spread shall respect the Spread-Offset Minimum. If a 
reduction in the Spread should violate the Spread-Offset Minimum, then the 
Buy Offset (or Sell Offset, or both as appropriate) shall be reduced 
accordingly. Similarly, if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula 
to a level greater than the Spread, the Spread shall be increased to maintain 
the Spread-Offset Minimum.

GUI/Formulas Example:

Constants
Intensity Factor: [4]
Dead Interval: [240]
Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR): [0.3]
Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR): [0.3]
Spread Minimum [0.04]
Spread Maximum [0.50]
Offset Minimum [0]
Offset Maximum [0.49]
Spread-Offset Minimum [0.01]

         INPUTS           OUTPUTS
Intensity Formula
Formula # Intensity   Spread Offset  Suspension
S1  >220   -0.01 n/a F
S2  <30   +0.01 n/a F
S3  <10   +0.02 n/a F

Transaction Formula
Formula # # Transactions  Spread Offset  Suspension
V1  <4   n/a -0.01 F
V2  >3   n/a +0.01 F
V3  >5   +0.01 +0.02 F
V4  >10   +0.02 +0.04 F
V5  >15   +0.04 +0.15 F
V6  >20   n/a n/a T
    
Note that #Transactions would be #Buys or #Sells, as appropriate. Note also 
that #Buys and #Sells are not intended to be an absolute count, but rather 
are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently 
occured.

In this example, all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through 
the GUI.


Simulation

Obviously, if we want to proceed, we will want to conduct several simulations 
to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness. However, to give some idea of 
how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular 
direction, please see the attached:




Additional Features

System Notifications

There should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader, which will be 
similar to Stack Manager Garbage Checks: Warning and Failure levels for both 
Offset and Price. The warning levels will trigger a pager message. The 
Failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be 
automatically suspended. The Price checks will be against prices input by the 
trader (not relative price movements, but actual price). There should be both 
maximum and minimum price checks (e.g. gas is trading at $5.50. The

Offset checks will only be against a maximum value.

As Final Exams Begin, Power Is a Big Question

For final exams, prepared students pack extra pens, calculators, bottled 
water, granola bars. And, at the University of California's Berkeley campus 
this year, a flashlight. 
As state officials and utilities struggle to maintain the power supply during 
California's continuing energy shortage, administrators and professors at the 
31,000-student campus are planning for the possibility that rolling blackouts 
may disrupt exams, which began on Friday and run through next Saturday.
''People here are used to interruptions,'' Sara Abbas, 21, a senior 
communications major, said with a shrug as she studied in a cafe near campus. 
''People walking in, people running around buck naked and whatnot. People 
have cut the power lines. They just reschedule.'' 
In an e-mail message sent Wednesday, the executive vice chancellor, Paul R. 
Gray, advised instructors to use ''individual discretion to decide the 
disposition of their examinations once the exam has started.'' Among the 
options: delay the test until the lights return; postpone it until a 
Saturday; grade the incomplete test; or cancel the exam altogether. 
Professors are also encouraged to check a Web site to see if their exam rooms 
have windows. ''In some classrooms,'' Mr. Gray noted, ''students may have 
sufficient natural light.'' 
The rolling blackouts could hit most of the campuses of the University of 
California and California State University. The two systems are embroiled in 
a legal dispute with Enron Energy Services, a Houston-based company that, in 
February, cut short a four-year contract to provide electricity directly to 
the universities. For now, the two systems -- among the largest energy 
consumers in the state -- are being supplied by Pacific Gas and Electric and 
Southern California Edison. 
Though several medical centers and the Davis, Los Angeles and Riverside 
campuses of the University of California system are exempt from the 
blackouts, the rest of the campuses have been put on alert. 
At Berkeley, the warning from Mr. Gray only heightened pre-exam stress 
levels. 
''Stopping in the middle of a final would be detrimental to my grade because 
I save the hardest questions until the end,'' said Heidi West, 20, a 
sophomore majoring in political science. 
Aaron Chung, a senior studying cognitive science, said it would be unfair to 
grade half-finished exams because he often circled answers instinctively, 
planning to return later with more care. ''The only thing I don't have a 
problem with is if the professors give everyone A's,'' Mr. Chung, 23, said. 
''You have to be under a lot of duress for that to happen.'' 
Gary L. Firestone, a biology professor, said he would move his 500-member 
class out into the sunshine and tell students to spread their blue books on 
the grass. But Jeff Good, a graduate student who teaches Introduction to 
Syntax and Semantics, said he would probably cancel the exam because the 
final counts for only 20 percent of the grade. 
That is what Michelle Chen, a junior linguistics major in Mr. Good's class, 
is hoping for. 
''I would love a blackout,'' Ms. Chen said. ''I'm going to turn on my 
air-conditioner. My toaster, too.''

(Copyright Times Newspapers Ltd, 2001)

BRITISH TELECOM has inflicted enough damage on itself in the past year. But 
others are still lining up to put the boot in. Hours after the company 
announced a Pounds 5.9 billion rights issue and the separation of cash-hungry 
BT Wireless, Moody's Investors Service lowered BT's credit rating. This 
thumbs-down will cost BT an extra Pounds 35 million a year on existing loans 
as well as making future working capital more expensive. 
The timing is odd. One of the two other main agencies presented with the same 
BT proposals maintained its rating and the other edged it down so little that 
change-of-rating clauses were not triggered. In the meantime, the market 
prices of BT debt have been rising. The Enron Cost of Credit, which measures 
the overall risk premium on BT borrowing, has halved since mid February. Such 
costly inconsistencies must focus more critical attention on the agencies, 
whose power has grown out of proportion to their accountability.
Moody's verdict is, however, peanuts compared with the cost to BT of the 
whims of Stephen Byers and the UK competition authorities. Moody's will no 
doubt be aghast to learn that Yell could be worth Pounds 1 billion less as a 
result. 
In 1996 the Monopolies and Mergers Commission found that BT's Yellow Pages 
had an 85 per cent monopoly of its market and made it sign undertakings to 
cut prices by 2 per cent a year in real terms. The Office of Fair Trading has 
reviewed this report; predictably, it has found that the enforced price cuts 
have kept competition down and kept Yell's market share up. 
The reasoning behind OFT advice that annual real price cuts should be doubled 
is closed to scrutiny until Mr Byers has a new BT undertaking. But it appears 
to argue that the market is still a monopoly, so Yell must be charging too 
much, so prices should fall further. 
The result, according to those formerly eager to buy Yell, is that a growth 
business has been turned into a stagnant one, losing all momentum. This 
sounds typical of the dead hand of UK regulation. It must strengthen the 
resolve of BT's new leaders to remodel what the authorities so hate to the 
greater advantage of shareholders.

OUTLOOK
Outlook
Houston needs to think small about future technology
WILLIAM DYLAN POWELL

(Copyright 2001)

OK, it's test time - sort of like a breakfast-time Rorschach test for Outlook 
readers. Here we go: What's the first thing that comes to mind when someone 
mentions Houston? 
Time's up. Your answers may have been energy, medicine or seemingly random 
acts of highway closure. But how about something very, very small? While 
Houston may not exactly be synonymous with all things tiny, we may want to 
start giving more mind share to the world of the miniature. As technology 
advances, Houston may owe a great deal to the study of small substances.
Nanotechnology is the study of creating functional structures on a molecular 
scale (the prefix "nano" means one billionth, or 10 to the ninth power 
numerically). Its theories and practices give scientists the means to 
construct useful entities using the smallest known particle of unaltered 
matter. 
Before your eyes glaze over in a terminology-induced science class flashback, 
you should hear some of the possibilities that this technology could afford 
residents of the Bayou City and their respective commercial enterprises. The 
possibilities give the works of science fiction author Ray Bradbury a run for 
their money, and include producing computers the size of viruses or factories 
that could fit neatly on your desk. Cancer-destroying robots could roam a 
patient's innards like mounted police at a spring break celebration. 
Eventually, all diseases and mutations could be eliminated. And all 
manufacturing processes would become waste-free, both in terms of the 
environment and from a business process standpoint. 
Sound like science fiction? Maybe, but truth is rapidly catching up with 
fiction. A team of university researchers recently figured out how to make a 
functional switch out of a single organic molecule. Discoveries such as these 
have spawned several branch fields of study including nanobiotics, NEMS 
(nanoelectromechanical systems) and nanomedicine. 
This technology would surely change the world. But it would especially affect 
Houston. Applications for nanotechnology are a great fit for Houston's 
economic landscape. The chemical industry already has begun conducting 
research in small-sizing certain chemical compounds. And the energy industry, 
still our darling, has great interest in the power management possibilities 
of nanotech. This could be Houston's next great vehicle for economic 
development. 
Nay-sayers have expressed caution regarding progress in this field on two 
separate fronts. First on how distant potential commercial offerings remain; 
and secondly on the potential dangers of combining genetic engineering, 
nanotechnology and robotics (for fear of creating self-assembling intelligent 
machines as often portrayed in science-fiction movies). But too much 
technological progress is happening at once for the possibilities not to whet 
the appetites of the entire scientific and business communities. 
Already, developmental overtures have been heard from Houston's little sister 
to the north. The Dallas-Fort Worth region and its growing base of 
semiconductor, light assembly and defense industries are keeping a close eye 
on developments in small science. In March, a private-sector company donated 
$2.5 million to the University of Texas at Dallas for nanotech research. And 
a handful of Dallas-area groups have been quietly conducting research of 
their own. This money augments the federal government's nearly half-billion 
dollar allotment of 2001 research funding for nanotechnology. Houston has its 
own projects, but they receive far less publicity. 
Houston's public nanoscience efforts have been centered mostly on Rice 
University's grand Turks of academia. Pushing the envelope of academic 
excellence as usual, Rice's heavyweight research barons continue to generate 
and distribute knowledge on the many potential applications of this exciting 
technology. But as successful as they are, they receive far less publicity 
and support than other less commercially significant disciplines. 
On May 29, leaders from the energy, medical and technology sectors will 
converge at the Houston Technology Forum to discuss various technology trends 
that will affect Houston's future. Will the keynote speakers (chief 
executives from Compaq, the Texas Medical Center and Enron) address the issue 
of what Houston is doing to prepare for advances in nanotechnology and its 
potential economic impact on the region? 
I certainly hope so. Energy, medicine and technology are the terra firma of 
Houston's economy. Each of these industry sectors could reap profound 
benefits by bringing nanotechnology's concepts to light. 
Sure, the fruits of this nascent science are still a long way off. But it's 
going to become remarkably important sooner than we think. So while 
Houstonians are well known for our love of largeness, it's time to think 
small. Let's take a careful evaluation of what this technology could mean to 
our city and its economic development.

A
Panel plots new course for area's future / Education, economics, quality of 
life top group's list of needed improvements

A group of prominent business executives, worried that Houston's reputation 
as an unpleasant place to live imperils its future, is developing a plan to 
transform the city's educational system, urban design and economic base. 
The work of the Center for Houston's Future, a nonprofit group affiliated 
with the Greater Houston Partnership, reflects growing concern that Houston 
must reposition itself as a vibrant, desirable destination if it is to 
compete in an economic climate that empowers skilled workers to live wherever 
they choose.
Creating such a "livable city," leaders of the effort say, would in turn 
enrich the lives of every Houstonian. 
"The interests of the business community are fully aligned with the interests 
of the community at large," said Eugene H. Vaughan, a money management 
executive and board chairman of the Center for Houston's Future. 
A report prepared for the organization by a business-based task force 
recommends that local leaders challenge long-held assumptions that have 
discouraged meaningful land-use planning. It sketches a vision of Houston 20 
years from now in which technology and other tools have revolutionized public 
education, "livable city centers" have changed the physical landscape and 
current civic leaders have groomed a new, more diverse generation of 
successors. 
The report argues that the business community's traditional leadership role 
in Houston's civic affairs should continue. But it suggests the models of 
business influence that prevailed in "the old days" should be re-examined. 
"Those were the days when oil was king, and Houston was the energy capital of 
the world - the days when a handful of `big' leaders, including CEOs of major 
corporations, could meet in a room together and decide on the future of 
Houston," the report states. 
"But times have changed, and there is far less tolerance in Houston's highly 
diverse, egalitarian society for a hidden oligarchy to run things, no matter 
how benevolent those leaders might be." 
The center's board includes top executives of some of Houston's most 
successful and influential companies, including Enron Chairman Ken Lay; Ned 
Holmes, chairman and CEO of Parkway Investments/Texas Inc.; James Royer, 
president and CEO of Turner, Collie & Braden Inc.; William White, president 
and CEO of WEDGE Group Inc.; and Jim Kollaer, president and CEO of the 
Greater Houston Partnership. 
Vaughan said the stature of the board members is an indication that the group 
is not likely to generate plans that will simply sit on a shelf. 
"They've got so many demands on their time that they're not going to fool 
around with something that is ill-conceived," he said. 
Rice University sociology professor Stephen Klineberg, one of the experts who 
advised the task force that generated the report, agreed that the center's 
work could be very influential. 
"This is the first time there's been a systematic, coordinated effort on the 
part of the business community" to improve Houston's quality of life, 
Klineberg said. 
The Center for Houston's Future was created in the early 1990s primarily as a 
source of research information for the partnership, Houston's premier 
business organization. But its role changed about two years ago, Vaughan 
said, when Holmes became chairman of the partnership and encouraged the 
center to take an aggressive approach to planning for the region's future. 
Last summer, the center organized three workshops attended by 36 people 
representing a cross section of the business community. These 10-day, 
seven-night events, led by professional facilitators and featuring various 
guest speakers, produced a report outlining four possible future Houston 
scenarios. 
James D. Calaway, a member of the center's board, said the details outlined 
in the four scenarios are intended to be "illustrative" and are not 
necessarily the actions the organization ultimately will recommend. However, 
they provide insight into the direction of the group's thinking, he said. 
In the first scenario, based on the assumption that local planning and 
decision-making proceed much as they have in the past, the workshop 
participants speculate that tension between the city and suburbs increases to 
the point that the Legislature strips Houston of its annexation power. 
Development is greatly restricted because of failure to meet clean-air 
standards, property values plummet and the City Council must pass a large tax 
rate increase. 
Houston becomes a stronghold of low-wage, service-sector employment, and the 
gap between rich and poor widens: "For many who live there, it's simply a 
large urban sprawl, adrift in the global economy, or it's a three-year 
hardship post on the way to something more desirable." 
Scenario two suggests that Houston's leaders transform the educational system 
by developing a "Teacher Network" that delivers Internet-based educational 
resources into every classroom and teacher's home in the region. This in turn 
leads to a communitywide electronic educational network, with every home in 
the Houston area connected to the Internet by 2007. 
These efforts, combined with universal, full-day preschool care, lead to 
state-of-the-art local schools by 2010, with almost universal high school 
graduation rates and 75 percent of these graduates going on to college or 
technical training programs. 
The report does not estimate the cost of these measures or identify how they 
would be funded. Potential sources, Calaway said, include local, state and 
federal tax money, private grants and reallocation of funds now being spent 
on more traditional educational programs. 
In scenario three, local leaders take bold steps to overcome Houston's 
reputation for sprawl, dirty air and lack of green space - perceptions that 
hamper efforts to attract the talent needed to keep the region economically 
competitive. 
These leaders develop a vision of Houston based on the creation of "livable 
city centers" - major activity centers targeted for redesign and 
redevelopment - and the connection of these centers through "personal and 
public transport in corridors that delight the eye." 
Within the centers, streets are reconstructed to better accommodate 
pedestrians. Financial incentives prompt developers to provide a wide range 
of housing styles, including substantial affordable housing. The Main Street 
light rail line is built, succeeds spectacularly and is followed by more rail 
lines extending in various directions. 
To accomplish these goals, the report states, local leaders must overcome 
their "ingrained suspicion of planning," and the City Council must adopt 
"new, more prescriptive development standards" within the livable city 
centers. Early successes lead to a public referendum authorizing the 
expenditure of $8 billion over 20 years to create the "livable city." 
Scenario four focuses on making Houston a "crossroads of the world economy." 
The city's business leadership becomes broader and more diverse, and it turns 
its energy toward diversifying the economy. 
The energy industry, adapting to the new economic climate, transforms its 
business model and creates new, high-tech enterprises. Space, nanotechnology 
and biotechnology research help launch hundreds of companies that quickly 
become significant global players. 
The workshop participants concluded that Houston must accomplish key elements 
of scenarios two, three and four if it is to become a "true world-class city 
in which to live and conduct business." 
Calaway and Vaughan said the next steps will include designating committees 
to develop specific recommendations in each of the broad areas studied, such 
as education and quality of life. Working groups then will be established to 
begin translating these ideas into policy, they said. 
Although the center is focused on the long term, they said, it must produce 
results as soon as possible. 
"If we do not get serious about this, 20 years from now we're going to be a 
low-wage environment, putting people in very, very dead- end jobs," Calaway 
said during a recent presentation on the group's work to members of the 
nonprofit Gulf Coast Institute. 
"We've got to get the quality of life right, but we've also got to make sure 
that we educate these kids for our future."

MSEB not to pick up 15 pc in DPC after phase II completion

05/13/2001
Press Trust of India Limited
(c) 2001 PTI Ltd.

Mumbai, May 13 (PTI) Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has decided 
not to pick up the remaining 15 per cent equity in Enron-promoted Dabhol 
Power Company (DPC), which it was earlier supposed to, after the complete 
construction of the entire USD three billion power project in Dabhol. 
"It is true that we had promised to take the 15 per cent, translating into 
infusion of around USD 65 million and given the serious financial stress the 
board is facing, it is not going to be possible for us to participate in the 
phase II of the project", a senior MSEB official told PTI here Sunday.
Currently, Enron International owns 65 per cent, MSEB -15 per cent, General 
Electric and Bechtel 10 per cent each. 
However, MSEB is yet to send an official intimation to DPC in this regard, 
the official said adding the board would inform the company soon after the 
completion of the project. 
DPC's USD 1.87 billion phase II would be fired on June seven, 2001, thus 
marking completion of the 2,184 MW project. 
DPC, which received a Foreign Investment and Promotion Board clearance in 
last December for its 10.83 billion foreign Direct Investment, has not been 
able to scout an alternative fifth partner for MSEB's equity. 
The company had decided to off load the 15 per cent of its current holding of 
65 per cent to a new entity, as according to the company's global 
debt-consolidation it needed to maintain its stake at 50 per cent in DPC 
after its completion. 
In order to avoid any delay, Enron had agreed to meet up with the equity 
shortfall as per the former's agreement with its lenders.

Enron plans to pull out of Gulf gas project: MEED

05/13/2001
Agence France-Presse
(Copyright 2001)

DUBAI, May 13 (AFP) - Enron Corp. of the United States plans to pull out of a 
project to deliver Qatari gas to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Middle East 
Economic Digest (MEED) reported on Sunday. 
Enron is a partner in the Dolphin Energy project along with the 
Franco-Belgian company TotalFinaElf and the Abu Dhabi government- owned UAE 
Offsets Group (UOG). Its role is to build a pipeline under the Gulf between 
Qatar and Abu Dhabi.
"The profit margin for Enron would be low. At present, the Dolphin project is 
being developed primarily as an upstream venture," an industry source told 
MEED. 
Another industry publication, Middle East Economic Survey (MEES), reported 
last week that the two other partners regarded Enron's estimated cost for 
constructing and laying the 350-kilometre (220- mile) undersea pipeline as 
too high. 
"There is talk of new partners," a source with TotalFinaElf, whose role is to 
develop a block in Qatar's giant North Field, told MEED. "But whatever 
happens, we are staying." 
On March 14, Qatar and the UAE inked a 25-year term sheet agreement on the 
project, setting the volume at two billion cubic feet (20 million cubic

Differences over pricing and volumes had put back the signing of the 
agreement for two years after a first statement of principle for Dolphin was 
inked by Qatar and UOG in March 1999. 
According to MEES, Qatar Petroleum and UOG have finally agreed on a gas price 
formula of 1.3 dollars per million BTU (British thermal units) following 
"high-level political intervention from Qatar and Abu Dhabi". 
TotalFinaElf and Enron are strategic partners in the multi- billion-dollar 
project, each holding a 24.5 percent share in Dolphin Energy Limited (DEL), 
with UOG retaining a controlling 51 percent stake. 
>From Abu Dhabi, the gas is to be distributed inside the emirate and on to 
Dubai and Oman. An extension to Pakistan through an undersea pipeline is also 
planned, as part of a regional gas network.

SMALL BUSINESS / Pleasure cruisin' / Yacht fleet owner offers customers what 
amounts to limo service on the lake

KEMAH - Tom Lober trundled home from second grade with a three- tiered wooden 
box he'd made at school. 
"This is my houseboat," he told his mother 35 years ago. "When I grow up, I'm 
going to live on a boat."
His practical-minded mother put the "boat" to work as a patio plant stand 
until it finally rotted from a decade of exposure. 
On a recent evening, Lober stood on the bow of one of his four charter 
yachts, enjoying the sunset-tinted water and a mild breeze as the 100-foot 
luxury boat moved quietly from Clear Lake into Galveston Bay. 
"This is what I love," Lober said, scanning a horizon dotted with distant 
boats. "The others are here to party, but this is it for me." 
The founder and owner of Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts spoke calmly against 
the din of a mini-Mardi Gras heating up on middeck, where bead-clad 
executives were letting their hair down at their annual appreciation party 
for a major customer. A Mae West look- alike hired for the event meandered 
among them, handing out cigars and sultry comments in her mermaid-cut white 
dress studded with faux pearls and a white feather boa twirled about her 
neck. 
In the eight and one-half years since the 42-year-old Lober started Star 
Fleet, he's seen everything from fire-eaters to hula dancers as entertainment 
on the hundreds of custom cruises his staff of 70 puts together each year. 
Last year, the company booked 400 cruises, which translated into $2.3 million 
in gross sales, in events ranging from Gulf Coast versions of company picnics 
to a bat mitzvah with a Gilligan's Island theme. One guy recently plunked 
down $2,000 to charter an entire boat for a date. 
One of Lober's seven captains is, handily, a licensed minister for weddings. 
Star Fleet staff recently added squirt guns, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks as 
regular on-board equipment. 
"It's a bizarre business," Lober said. "Nothing seems unusual anymore." 
Nearly all Star Fleet's cruises include dinner. His kitchen staff does the 
prep work for hors d'oeuvres and main courses on land near the marina, 
transferring them to a generous galley on board before customers arrive. The 
galley crew does the final cooking. 
Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts is one of about a dozen businesses of its 
size in the country that provides strictly private charter yacht cruises, but 
Lober has hundreds of competitors locally. 
"I'm competing with caterers, hotels, restaurants - anyone in the eating, 
drinking and party business," he said. "People say there are two things 
you're never supposed to own: a boat and a restaurant. I put a restaurant on 
a boat." 
Last month, he launched what he believes is the first-ever water limousine, a 
30-foot yacht complete with wet bar, sound system, leather couches, TV and 
VCR that takes small groups to waterfront restaurants and bars, just like a 
limo does on land. 
Sometimes, his clients hop off and dine at one of the restaurants on the 
Kemah Boardwalk while the limo is anchored beside it. In other cases, waiters 
deliver the food to the boat, equipped with removable dining tables that can 
seat 14, and the customers dine while cruising Clear Lake. 
Lober was a natural shoo-in for a career on the water. His father owned a 
supply boat business in Houston and a fleet of shrimp boats based in 
Trinidad. He eventually became president of his dad's supply boat business 
after getting a master's degree in maritime management from Texas A&M 
Maritime Academy in Galveston in 1981. 
But he still had that idea from second grade that grew from living on a boat 
to providing exclusive entertainment on the water. 
In 1986, he joined the Passenger Vessel Association, a national group of 
vessel owners that provides public or private cruises for gaming, ecotourism 
or other entertainment. He attended seminars, talked to boat owners, 
researched trends in the industry and tried to figure out what it would take 
to float his idea. 
Lober drew up plans for a boat big enough to accommodate up to 150 
passengers, but with a three-foot draft to keep from running aground in the 
notoriously shallow Clear Lake and Galveston Bay. 
"I wanted to be able to take that boat anywhere on the lake," which is five 
feet deep in places, he said. 
Bankers were skeptical when he approached them for a loan. 
"This was a new business in Houston that had never been done before," Lober 
said. "They had no confidence. 
"I finally got to the point where I'd just take my business plan into a bank 
and say, `I know I'm not going to get a loan - just look at what I've got and 
tell me what it needs,' " he said. 
Even without a loan in place, Lober began hands-on research. During the week, 
he still worked at his father's supply boat business, but flew to Fort 
Lauderdale, Fla., on weekends to work as a deck hand and food server for a 
charter yacht company to learn the business from the bottom up. 
After a year of loan seeking, he found a lender at the Passenger Vessel 
Association's annual meeting. Caterpillar Finance agreed to lend him 60 
percent of the $950,000 in construction costs if he installed Caterpillar 
engines on the boat. 
Construction took a year, during which Lober continued his research, serving 
drinks on weekends aboard a charter boat on the Detroit River and Lake St. 
Clair. 
Finally, Lober launched Star Gazer in October 1993. 
The maritime academy might have taught him how to navigate by the stars, but 
it didn't prepare him for marketing. 
"I didn't know what I was doing," Lober said. "The first year, I spent 
$125,000 in marketing blunders," including a $50,000 mass mail campaign that 
he called "a total flop." 
Marketing was twice as expensive as he thought it would be and took twice as 
long for potential customers to understand the concept he was trying to sell, 
he said. Meanwhile, his boat sat in the stall for up to three weeks at a 
time. 
Lober had a $30,000 monthly overhead in debt service, office rental, 
insurance and slip fees, and "I still had to pay it if the boat didn't leave 
once," he said. 
Panicked, he joined the Greater Houston Partnership to seek out ideas, and he 
got one: target marketing. 
He and his small staff scrutinized every detail about the people who used the 
boat and set out to find more like them. He set his sights on the corporate 
client, which makes up about 70 percent of his business today. Corporate 
customers include Enron, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Continental Airlines and Katy 
Mills mall. 
"We have had our party with Star Fleet every year for five years," said Ravi 
Lal, director of ethylene division of Technip, based in San Dimas, Calif. 
"The first year, I wanted to do something special that I hadn't seen before. 
Everybody likes it, and everybody wants to come back." 
Business slowly began to build, and word spread. Lober added the 90-foot Star 
Cruiser in 1997, the 74-foot Star Spirit in 1999, and brought in a fourth, 
the Lake Limo, last month. Also in 1999, he bought 6 acres with 600 feet of 
waterfront and built Star Fleet Marina. While part of that land is still 
undeveloped, it eventually will become a parking lot for 500 cars when Lober 
adds a fifth large yacht, Star Ship, sometime in the future. 
"We plan to add Star Ship when we're turning down enough business from the 
other boats," he said. 
After more than eight years, Lober has yet to take home a salary, putting 
everything back into the business. 
The more he puts back, the more business he can accommodate. 
But Lober and his staff still keep close tabs on their customers. 
"We track everything - which individuals, what type of event, whether they 
prefer sit-down dinners, how they heard about us - you name it," he said. 
It's a lot of details. He knows that blackout shades, pull-down projector 
screens and multiple microphone jacks are needed for presentations, and that 
some clients like to be picked up at one of the Galveston hotels or other 
locations on the Houston Ship Channel. 
If a customer hires a deejay, a crewmember provides padding to put underneath 
the CD player on the bandstand because dancing on the steel dance floor 
causes the player to bounce. 
Lober's three full-time cruise consultants handle charter buses to and from 
the marina, limos, menus, photographers and decorations. They work with Star 
Fleet's in-house florist and theme designer to provide floral arrangements 
for sit-down dinners and Hawaiian leis of fresh orchids and hibiscus for a 
major retailer's party, for which the florist helped transform the boat's 
stanchions into palm trees. 
And consultants have their own suggestions, such as bestowing captains' hats 
instead of the usual corsages to employees with top sales who were being 
honored at a recent floating awards banquet. 
Lober believes his company's custom service brings customers back. 
"They handle all the details once, and after customers go on that first 
cruise, they're sold on the concept," he said. "People love something 
different. We provide a different kind of party. If they do it once, they 
usually want to do it again." 
But cruises aren't limited to parties, Lober said. Customers have chartered 
boats for banquets, retreats, new product introductions, incentive awards 
dinners and for scattering loved ones' ashes. 
About 60 percent of Star Fleet's business is repeat and referral. The recent 
corporate party featuring the Mae West look-alike was the fifth the company 
has chosen to have with Star Fleet. 
Part of Lober's initial marketing problem - which continues today - is that 
Houstonians just don't realize how close to the water they are. 
"It's not like Fort Lauderdale, where water is part of the landscape," he 
said. "In Houston, there's no high-visibility location to see the water, just 
one spot on Loop 610 that overlooks the Port of Houston. Even in Clear Lake, 
there are only one or two places when you drive around the lake that you can 
actually see the water. We don't have a San Francisco Bay or New York Harbor. 
So people have to be reminded." 
He also has to deal with the misconception that only the very rich can afford 
cruises, Lober said. 
"Some people think they can't afford a luxury yacht, but when they compare 
our complete package with upscale restaurants, hotel banquet facilities, 
country clubs and wedding manors, we are quite competitive," he said. "And 
our food is gourmet quality. Just like a five-star hotel, we never cut 
corners." 
Event cruises start at $40 per guest including food, bar, entertainment, tax 
and gratuities. 
Lober depends heavily on customer surveys to develop the service he and his 
crew provide. And customers informally give Star Fleet staff new ideas with 
some of the extras they bring aboard, such as the squirt guns, Mardi Gras 
beads, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks. 
"We learn a lot from our customers," he said. "We see what they do, take the 
best and give it back to them." 
Because customer surveys indicate that about 20 percent of Star Fleet's 
business comes from being seen on the water, Lober and his captains make 
their crafts as visible as possible whenever they take them out. The real 
opportunity for hot-dogging comes when a customer charters two or three 
boats, and they raft up to become the Star Fleet flotilla, with customers 
moving from one boat to another. A three-boat charter can handle up to 375 
guests. 
But one boat can still do a lot of advertising. 
At the recent corporate party, Mae West joined the other revelers who were 
slinging Mardi Gras beads at al fresco diners as Capt. Tony DeFore edged Star 
Gazer close to the Kemah waterfront. They may not have known it, but they 
were doing a little of Lober's public relations work for him. 
As the boat pulled back into the Star Fleet Marina, Lober pointed out a barge 
under construction. When it is finished - by the end of the year, he hopes - 
the bottom floor will be a galley for food preparation, the second the Star 
Fleet office and the third floor an 1,800-square-foot apartment. 
It will kind of resemble that three-tiered wooden box he brought home from 
school years ago, Lober says. 
And he's going to live at the top.

More power to reform agenda
Soma Banerjee

THE electricity industry is often identified as the black sheep in the 
infrastructure sector which has continued to lag behind despite an overdose 
of government support. 
Despite being one of the earlier industries to be opened up, private 
investments in this sector have failed to take off.
Worse, the only sizeable project which was something to write home about 
Enrons Dabhol Power plant in Maharashtra is currently a under cloud with its 
promoters involved in a legal battle with the state entity and its sole 
consumer for non-payment of bills. Policy makers and investors in the energy 
sector are still groping to find ways and means to improve the performance of 
this key industry. 
Although private investments were expected to come in a big way in creating 
new capacities, policy uncertainties and above all the poor financial health 
of the consumer, in most cases the SEBs, have posed major problems for power 
plant developers. 
After about ten years of liberalisation, the private sector has to its credit 
only about 5000 MW and according to projections by experts investments in 
greenfield projects are unlikely before four to five years. 
The factors that have been taken into consideration in the current projection 
are almost inbuilt into the system. For one, there is a general agreement 
that stressing on generation alone without doing much on the distribution 
front has eroded the financial health of most SEBs. 
``Private power developers cannot be expected to invest in projects till they 
are assured that they will be paid for the energy produced, experts say. 
But like the recent Montek Singh Ahluwalia report maintains, such reforms 
cannot be done overnight and will require minimum five to seven years before 
they break even. 
The sector has already seen major exits like Cogentrix and Powergen and if 
the current trends are anything to go by it would not be long before Enron 
too says Sayonara India, claim sources in the power industry. 
IPPAI, an association for private power investments, feels that the flip-flop 
by the government as far as power policies are concerned have made it 
difficult for investors to take decisions. 
``Take this as an example at one time there were more than 200 MoUs signed up 
for private power projects, the government provided counter guarantees for 
eight projects, of which only three have taken off. Of this the Enron project 
is already facing problems of nonpayment, says a senior source. 
According to estimates drawn up by financial institutions like Power Finance 
Corporation an organisation responsible for monitoring the financial health 
of the SEBs and helping them with their reform programmes almost all the SEBs 
have registered a negative turnover. Which is why the financing or 
escrowability of SEBs across the country has been reduced to zero. 
According to Union power minister Suresh Prabhu, the states are now 
responsive to changes and reforms and the recent drive initiated by the 
Centre to work with the state governments was expected to yield results. 
But this sector has seen far too many committees which have failed to yield 
much hope and it is only sheer determination of SEBs and political will that 
can help this backbencher.

India Power Min: New Power Deal With Enron Unit Possible
By Himendra Kumar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

05/12/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India is hopeful the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board's power purchase agreement with the U.S. energy company Enron Corp.'s 
(ENE) Indian unit Dabhol Power Co. can be renegotiated and the DPC's dispute 
over payments be settled, the country's federal Power Minister Suresh Prabhu 
said. 
In a weekend interview with Dow Jones Newswires, Prabhu said the very fact 
that the DPC had come to the negotiating table for discussions on its power 
price was an indication that Enron was keen to save its India project.
A special panel, set up by the Maharashtra state government, met with 
representatives of the DPC, for the first time Friday and agreed to another 
meeting May 23. 
Friday's meeting lasted for more than two hours. 
"I am of the view that a negotiated settlement is possible since the first 
meeting of DPC with the Maharahtra state expert panel went off well. There 
has been a positive response both from the DPC and the MSEB after the 
meeting. The central government will also reciprocate by participating in a 
meaningful dialogue. The next meeting will really decide on how it all goes," 
Prabhu said. 
Earlier this week, in an e-mail to Dow Jones Newswires from Houston, Enron 
Vice President John Ambler however, said, "While we have constantly 
maintained that we are open to continuing a dialogue towards resolving 
issues, this (Friday) meeting should in no manner be construed as an open 
offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract." 
The Maharashtra state government contends that the price paid for electricity 
from the Dabhol power plant, India's biggest-ever foreign investment at $2.9 
billion, is "unaffordable" and seeks to renegotiate tariffs. 
A recent committee appointed by the government, the Godbole panel, 
recommended that the power purchase agreement be renegotiated. 
Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power. 
Critics object to Dabhol charging 7.1 rupees ($1=INR46.8825) a kilowatt-hour 
for its power, compared with INR1.5/kwh charged by other suppliers. 
The 2,184-megawatt DPC project in Maharashtra has been mired in financial 
disputes after the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its main customer, 
failed to pay the December 2000 and January bills. The Godbole panel is 
working toward lowering the DPC's power tariff and allowing the sale of 
excess power to the federal government or its utilities. A restructuring of 
the DPC's stakeholding may also be on the agenda. 
The Maharashtra government has asked the committee to try to negotiate a 
revised agreement within a month. The DPC currently operates a 740-megawatt 
naphtha plant contributing about 0.7% to India's installed capacity. Enron 
has maintained that work will be completed by the year-end in the second 
phase of the Dabhol project that will add 1,444 MW to its capacity. The plant 
will switch from naphtha to liquefied natural gas as a fuel source in 2002. 
Texas-based Enron has a 65% stake in the DPC and is the project's largest 
shareholder. Other shareholders include the MSEB with 15%, and General 
Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel Enterprises (X.BTL) with 10% each.

India: Talks begin on Dabhol issue

Asia Intelligence Wire

MUMBAI, May 11. OFFICIALS of Enron India today met the expert committee 
headed by Dr Madhav Godbole to discuss the fate of Enron's Dabhol Power 
Company. 
Mr A.V. Gokak, Union Government representative, who was appointed only last 
night, could not attend the meeting due to the short notice.
Lenders to the project who were to attend the meeting stayed away. 
Instead, Mr A.G. Karkhanis, former Executive Director, Industrial Development 
Bank of India, attended as observer on behalf of foreign and Indian lenders, 
Mr Vinay Mohan Lal, Energy Secretary, told reporters here after the meeting. 
When asked about Enron's reluctance to renegotiate, Mr Lal said: "They are 
coming again on May 23. What does that mean?" 
Though none of those present at the meeting was willing to give more details, 
senior State Government officials had earlier told Business Line that the 
State would be willing to discuss phase II only after a decision on the 
rebate slapped on DPC. 
"Basically our strategy will be to bring the Rs 401- crore rebate payable by 
DPC to the centre-stage," the official said. "The company has not mentioned a 
single word about the rebate in any of their letters to either the MSEB or 
the State. And we, on the other hand, have discussed anything but the rebate 
in our letters to DPC," he said. 
Mr Wade Cline, Managing Director, Enron India, did not comment on whether the 
company would issue the preliminary termination notice. 
The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) Chairman, Mr Vinay Bansal, and 
Mr Lal had last evening briefed the Democratic Front constituents about their 
stand vis-a-vis Enron. 
They are understood to have told the political brass of the State that MSEB 
does not need the second phase of the Dabhol power project. 
They categorically said MSEB would not buy power from DPC-phase II, it is 
learnt. 
MSEB also reiterated its stand that DPC should adjust the dues owed by it 
against the non-performance penalty. 
Senior MSEB officials said the board had replied to the arbitration notice 
issued by DPC and made its position clear. The board is of the opinion that 
DPC should adjust Rs 213 crore - the December and January bills - against the 
Rs 401 crore penalty for performance default. 
The State Government also has backed the MSEB in its replies to the three 
arbitration notices served on it. It has said that since MSEB does not accept 
the charges - non-compliance with the power purchase agreement (PPA) - 
leveled against it, the State is not bound to pay. 
The Centre too is understood to have backed MSEB in its preliminary reply to 
the conciliation notice from DPC. 
Today's meeting was attended by Mr Cline, Mr Neil McGregor, President, DPC, 
Mr Mukesh Tyagi, Vice-President, DPC, and Mr Sanjeev Khandekar, VP, DPC, and 
Mr Mohan Gurunath, Chief Financial Officer, DPC. 
Among the renegotiation panel members, Mr Deepak Parekh, Mr E A S Sarma and 
Mr Kirit Parikh were also unable to attend. The next meeting is scheduled on 
May 23, Mr Lal said. 
Gokak nominated to panel: The Government has nominated former fertiliser and 
telecom secretary, Mr A.V. Gokak, to the arbitration committee involving 
Dabhol Power Company (DPC). 
The Power Ministry had earlier mooted the additional solicitor general, Mr 
Harish Salve's candidature for the job. 
The conciliation process, however, has been hanging fire as the third 
conciliator is yet to be appointed. Dabhol Power Company had written to the 
Centre last month seeking six names for selection of a mutually acceptable 
conciliator to kick- start the conciliation process. 
DPC's letter to the Finance Ministry was seen in the context of the 
substantial delay between the initiation of the conciliation process three 
weeks ago and the finalisation of the conciliators. Soon after the 
conciliation process was initiated, DPC decided to invoke political force 
majeure and moved in for arbitration - a prelude to termination of the 
project.

India to allow 3rd party sale if DPC, MSEB jointly approach

05/12/2001
Press Trust of India Limited
(c) 2001 PTI Ltd.

Mumbai, May 12 (PTI) The Federal Government will allow sale of power to a 
"willing buyer" if the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) and 
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) will together approach the power 
ministry with a concrete proposal for their 2,184 mw project in Dabhol. 
"I will give whatever status they want, including a mega project one, if DPC 
and MSEB jointly approach the Centre (Federal Government) for the same", 
Indian Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told reporters here Saturday.
He said the Indian Government would extend its cooperation to the Maharashtra 
government (western state) "in every way" to resolve the imbroglio between 
MSEB and DPC. 
When pointed out that both the state government and DPC were of the opinion 
that federal power utility National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) should 
buy the power, Prabhu said NTPC cannot do so as it was power selling entity 
and not buying one. 
"There is no question of NTPC buying power from the project since long term 
power purchase agreements (PPAs) have been signed by NTPC with the buying 
states", he reiterated. 
Prabhu said the Indian Government would also try and find out potential 
buyers of DPC power "if other states were willing to buy the same". 
Earlier in his meeting with state chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, the 
latter had suggested that NTPC sell the excess power over and above the 
300-400 MW needed for the state from the 740 MW phase-I and soon to be 
commissioned phase-II of 1,444 MW, to other needy states.

LOCAL STORIES
DEFAZIO CALLS FOR STATE TO BUY PGE TO PROTECT RATES
DAVE HOGAN AND JEFF MAPES of the Oregonian Staff

05/12/2001
Portland Oregonian
SUNRISE
C01
(Copyright (c) The Oregonian 2001)

Summary: The suggestion generates little enthusiasm and critics suspect it's 
motivated by the lawmaker's possible race for governor 
"I believe this is an extraordinary opportunity and a way that we can 
insulate almost a quarter of our population and a core of Oregon's business 
community from the craziness that is going on in the energy wholesale 
markets." -- U.S. REP. PETER DeFAZIO D-ORE.
The state of Oregon should consider buying investor-owned Portland General 
Electric to help protect Oregonians from gyrations in the electricity market, 
U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio declared Friday. 
Gov. John Kitzhaber reacted politely and said he'll explore the idea, but 
others said it's a long shot because of political, financial and timing 
factors. 
Critics said the proposal appeared aimed more at attracting attention to 
DeFazio's potential candidacy for governor than anything else. 
Several companies already are considering buying the utility, but DeFazio 
said state ownership could help keep PGE customers' electricity rates low and 
generate profits that could help the rest of Oregon. 
"I believe this is an extraordinary opportunity and a way that we can 
insulate almost a quarter of our population and a core of Oregon's business 
community from the craziness that is going on in the energy wholesale 
markets," said DeFazio, D-Ore. 
PGE serves about 725,000 retail customers, mostly in the Portland area, and 
is owned by Houston-based Enron Corp. PGE's sale to Nevada's Sierra Pacific 
Resources for $3.1 billion officially fell apart last month. Other possible 
buyers include Northwest Natural and ScottishPower, which owns PacifiCorp. 
While Enron and PGE officials declined to comment Friday, legislative leaders 
showed no particular enthusiasm for DeFazio's idea. 
"I appreciate his efforts, but I don't think it's the right idea at this 
time," said House Speaker Mark Simmons, R-Elgin. He said the state already 
has a package of bills aimed at spurring more energy production and 
conservation. 
Senate President Gene Derfler, R-Salem, said he'd be willing to sit down and 
talk with DeFazio. "I would not just shut the door," he said, but he doesn't 
plan to devote much work to the proposal. Derfler questioned whether state 
government could run a utility as efficiently as a business. 
DeFazio said a PGE purchase would offer several benefits. State ownership 
would put control of PGE in local hands instead of those of a faraway 
corporation such as ScottishPower. For PGE customers, state ownership would 
provide some protection and stability in electricity rates. It also would be 
a good investment that would pay for itself and perhaps pump revenue back 
into the state's coffers. 
The purchase could be financed with tax-exempt bonds sold by the state. 
DeFazio said state Treasurer Randall Edwards had told him the idea was "in 
the realm of possibility." 
DeFazio's idea is an intriguing one and could provide some benefits, said Bob 
Jenks, executive director of the Citizens' Utility Board, which represents 
customers of investor-owned utilities such as PGE. 
Jenks said the primary benefit would be that, if the state bought PGE, the 
utility would be able to buy lower-priced electricity from the Bonneville 
Power Administration, which is required to sell power at lower rates to 
publicly owned utilities. However, a publicly owned PGE wouldn't be able to 
buy the lower-priced BPA power for about five years because of electricity 
sales contracts that already are in place. 
And even if PGE were able to buy lower-priced BPA power, that wouldn't 
necessarily translate to lower electricity bills for PGE customers, Jenks 
said. In addition, he said it could increase rates for other publicly owned 
utilities because the BPA has a shortage of cheap hydropower. 
The state Public Utility Commission would have to approve any sale of PGE, 
but outgoing PUC Chairman Ron Eachus criticized DeFazio's proposal, saying it 
had the potential to increase rates both for PGE customers and for publicly 
owned utilities. He also said it seemed designed to get political attention 
for DeFazio's potential candidacy. 
"I think we're in the political season where people are proposing grandiose 
schemes that aren't very well thought out, and this seems to be one of 
those," Eachus said. 
DeFazio conceded that a high-profile proposal focused on a Portland-area 
issue such as the ownership of PGE would be a good way for a candidate to 
build support for a run for governor, but he said that had nothing to do with 
his plan.

Congressman suggests state buy PGE
By CHARLES E. BEGGS
Associated Press Writer

SALEM, Ore. (AP) - Congressman Peter DeFazio on Friday proposed that the 
state buy Portland General Electric as a way to hold down power costs. 
The Democrat outlined his plan after presenting it to Gov. John Kitzhaber, 
who said he would ask his energy advisers to analyze it.
PGE is Oregon's biggest electric utility, serving more than 700,000 
customers. DeFazio said a state purchase of the company could insulate many 
Oregonians from "the craziness in power markets." 
DeFazio said the state could buy the company by issuing revenue bonds and 
have the utility operate as a public power entity. 
He said the purchase would give the state a diverse mix of transmission 
rights along with hydropower, gas, coal and renewable energy sources. 
"While I have not exhaustively researched the proposal, it does appear to be 
feasible," said DeFazio, an opponent of electric deregulation. 
Enron Corp., the Texas-based owner of PGE, is trying to sell the utility. 
Sierra Pacific last month abandoned its plan to buy PGE for $3.1 billion, 
citing increasing difficulties in the current market and the political 
environment in the West. 
Kitzhaber said he's not opposed to the idea of the state buying a private 
utility, as long as it would benefit consumers. 
DeFazio said PGE has been a profitable company, and putting it in public 
ownership could give it preference over private utilities for the Bonneville 
Power Administration's hydropower. 
The congressman's suggestion wasn't welcomed by the Legislature. 
"Thanks, but no thanks," said House Speaker Mark Simmons. 
"Philosophically, I think it's the wrong approach," he said. "We have a 
bipartisan package of bills dealing with the issue." 
Among those are his measure to delay partial electric deregulation for large 
businesses and a bill to speed up the process for siting temporary generating 
plants. 
Senate President Gene Derfler didn't reject the idea, but said the 
Legislature doesn't have enough time in the current session to take on a job 
like a utility purchase.

Jennifer asked me to explain about the effect of the refinery fire.

The St. Croix refinery has their reformer offline.  The reformer is used to 
convert straight-run naphtha into a high octane blending component called 
reformate as well as some butane and lighter gases.  The effect would not 
really be a reduction in gasoline, but a reduction in a high quality blending 
component which would make it harder to make RFG.

As of this writing, the fire is out. If you have any further questions, feel 
free to contact me.

Some of our food processing factories in the Midwest which have fuel switching
capability find it profitable at these gas prices to burn rendered animal fat 
in
lieu of natural gas.  Apparently, the doesn't hurt the boiler machinery.  One 
of
the guys responsible for this move did a back of the envelope calculation and
found that at $8.00 / Dth NG prices it was even profitable to buy olive oil in
bulk as a heating fuel.  They haven't used veggie oil yet but are considering
it.  Anyone else hear any stories of end users switching to unusual fuels?

John:

Enron has a couple of suites reserved strictly for Enron use.  Each one holds 
21 people and the cost would be $2550 without food.  If we needed another 
suite then, Enron Field would charge us $100 per person as long as one of 
their suites is available.

John

Hope you're well.

We are doing some work here on the long term curve for UK natural gas and 
would value your views on the long term NYMEX Nat gas curve.
By long term I am talking 7-20 years. 

Our thinking is that beyond the traded period of 5-10 years forward, UK 
prices would at least partially reflect the long run marginal cost of LNG in 
a "globalised" market provided US prices were not significantly above.

As we are currently working on some long term structured deals it would be 
great to get your input on this. 

Many thanks

Andy

Mike- I have their trader coming into the office tomorrow- they are a macro 
fund (they manage Harvard's endowment fund) that trades commodities- mostly 
crude and metals.  I want to get them into some gas and power trades.  
Specifically, I want to get them into the short Rockies trade for the summer 
that we have Tudor in.  

Johnny recommended I have you speak to them- can you give me a few minutes 
during the day to talk to them about the west in general.

I have him in all day- we are sitting with Mike Roberts to do the weather 
update from 6 am-7:30 - would be great if we could get you between 7:30 and 
8:30 am.  If not, let me know when is good- Ina will know where I am

Hawk vote for California firm unanimous 
Montgomery Watson pegged for water plant 
By MARY FLOOD 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
The Houston Area Water Corp. voted unanimously Monday to grant a $92 million 
contract to a California-based firm to design, build and operate a Lake 
Houston water plant. 
City Council soon will receive the contract for its approval. The 
administration of Mayor Lee Brown was believed to have favored Montgomery 
Watson's chief competitor, Azurix Corp., an arm of local energy giant Enron 
Corp. 
The water corporation, known as "the Hawk," voted 5-0 to grant the contract. 
If approved by City Council, the contract would give the company 2 1/2 years 
to get the plant up and treating raw lake water. 
It was initially expected that the plant, which will be designed to handle 40 
million gallons of water daily, could cost as much as $150 million to build. 
The Hawk board asked the vying companies to modify their bids several times, 
and that caused the competitors to lower their prices. 
The contract calls for the Hawk to pay a monthly operating fee of $157,000 
when the plant is working. And Montgomery Watson could be required to 
construct, at the Hawk's option, an additional 40 million-gallon-a-day plant 
expansion for $32 million. 
But the details of how the plant will be financed have not been determined. 
The Hawk board discussed borrowing money using the city's credit rating on a 
short-term basis until it could develop long-term financing by selling bonds 
itself. 
The initial customer for the water is the city of Houston, which would repay 
the Hawk the cost of producing the treated water. The hope is that the plant 
eventually will provide water to other entities in the area as well. This 
plant is part of an area plan for the treatment of surface water that could 
cost about $2 billion to implement. 
City Councilman Carroll Robinson, who heads the council infrastructure 
committee, said he expects to hold two hearings about the contract. One would 
focus on how the Hawk board picked Montgomery Watson. A series of three 
recommendations from City Hall staff recommended Azurix. 
Hawk board members said Montgomery Watson's prices were lower by millions and 
that Azurix plans to sell Azurix North America, the body that would oversee 
this contract. 
The second City Council hearing will focus on financing, Robinson said. "In 
my mind, how the city will pay for this construction is as important as who 
will do it," Robinson said. 
The Hawk board, appointed by Brown and approved by City Council, has been 
heavily lobbied by the contenders for the job. 
Because City Council does not have to follow the Hawk recommendation, new 
pressure has begun at City Hall. The third bidder, U.S. Filter Operating 
Services, part of a French company, has been heavily lobbying some council 
members to switch the contract to it. 
Some members of the Azurix team -- people at companies that would have gotten 
work had Azurix gotten the job -- have written letters complaining about the 
Hawk procedures as well. 
John M. Stokes, president and chief executive officer of Azurix, penned the 
first such distressed missive. In April, he wrote to Hawk board Chairman 
David Berg complaining of the "deleterious economic effect" on Azurix of the 
board's decision to negotiate with Montgomery Watson. He requested that Berg 
answer a series of questions in writing explaining why Azurix didn't get the 
job. Berg didn't do so. 
Although that letter had a threatening tone, Amanda Martin, president of 
Azurix North America, said no threat was intended and the letter simply 
indicated how upset the team was when it first learned Azurix wasn't chosen. 
Azurix was the rumored front-runner for months. 


		

		
		
		
		INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY: Enron may cut stake in Gulf gas project 
Financial Times; May 15, 2001
By ROBIN ALLEN

		There are growing fears that Enron, the US power company, may withdraw or 
sharply reduce its stake in the Gulf's Dollars 10bn Dolphin gas export 
scheme, one of the most ambitious of its kind in the region. 
		Enron officials have refused to comment on reports that the company is 
reconsidering its position as a minority shareholder in Dolphin Energy, in 
which France's TotalFinaElf (TFE) also has 24.5 per cent. 
		However, one industry specialist said yesterday Enron was talking of 
"selling" at least part of its shareholding. 
		The threat raises critical issues for western companies seeking to profit 
from accessing state-owned oil and gas in the Gulf. 
		The project was launched two years ago by Abu Dhabi, the wealthiest of the 
United Arab Emirates, to promote energy security for the Gulf. But Abu 
Dhabiis seen as a prime example of a state where prestige and opaque domestic 
political considerations can be as important as profitability in such a 
large-scale project, especially in the early stages. 
		Dolphin's majority owner is UAE's Offsets Group (UOG), an offshoot of Abu 
Dhabi's defence procurement industry. In March, Dolphin, a relative newcomer 
on Abu Dhabi's energy scene, signed a Dollars 3.5bn agreement with Qatar to 
exploit and pipe up to 2bn cubic feet a day of gas from Qatar's prolific 
North Field to Abu Dhabi. 
		Qatari gas is the source of Abu Dhabi's long-term energy strategy, and Enron
's role was to develop, at a profit, the downstream section, primarily to 
construct and lay the 350km pipeline from Qatar to Abu Dhabi. 
		Enron is not a specialist in energy production or pipeline fabrication, but 
one of its main aims, according to one analyst, was to gain access to the gas 
accruing to it from the Qatar deal and then trade it on. Sheikh Zayed Bin 
Sultan al-Nahyan, Abu Dhabi's ruler, disapproves of commodity trading. 
		"If the Qatar-UAE gas deal was going to be profitable" for western energy 
majors, asked one senior western diplomat, "then why are the serious US 
energy majors not involved?" For more reports see www.ft.com/globaleconomy

JAPAN: Enron says high power rates costing Japan.

05/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

TOKYO, May 15 (Reuters) - A senior executive of U.S. energy giant Enron Corp 
said on Tuesday that Japan could save an estimated four trillion yen ($32.45 
billion) in annual costs if electricity rates were cut to the average of 
members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 
"If you were to pare Japanese industrial electric rates to the OECD 
average...savings to all...customers would be about four trillion yen per 
year," Enron Corp Vice President Steven Kean told a seminar in Tokyo.
Speaking at a seminar on electric power deregulation, Kean said that 
indigenous factors such as steep land prices and a lack of natural energy 
resources were often blamed for Japan's high electricity rates. 
But he said these factors were not sufficient to explain Japan's high 
electricity rates. 
A report commissioned by Enron Japan Corp showed that in 1998 Japan's 
electricity rates for industrial users were 16.81 yen per kilowatt hour (kWh) 
compared to a second highest rate of 12.44 yen in Italy. 
Japan's business sector has expressed concern at the nation's high 
electricity rates, saying that it blunts their competitive edge on the 
international market. 
Kean also drew parallels between Japan, in the midst of deregulation, and 
California which has been suffering from a power shortage since deregulating 
its market in 1998. 
These included the length of time that authorities in Japan took to issue 
permits to allow the construction of new power plants, he said. 
"The regulatory structure in Japan is very strict...just like in California," 
Kean said. 
North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity, Enron gained its 
first foothold in Japan in 1999 when it established affiliate E Power Corp. 
In April of last year, it set up subsidiary Enron Japan Corp. 
Kean urged Japan to step up measures to open up its power market, a process 
he said held many benefits. 
Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market. Since March last 
year, large-lot consumers have been free to chose their suppliers. The 
measure liberalised an estimated 30 percent of the power market and ended 
Japan's 10 power utilities regional monopoly. 
However, industry watchers note that there have been very few new entrants 
and that further deregulation measures must be taken for rates to fall. The 
Japanese government is due to review the process in 2003.

Japan Must Speed Up Pwr Sector Dereg To Lower Rates-Indus

05/15/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Japan should accelerate the ongoing electric power sector 
deregulation to fully liberalize the retail market, in order to bring down 
the country's high power rates while ensuring stable power supply, experts 
said at an industry seminar Tuesday. 
The pressure is mounting for Japan's 10 power utilities, which have long 
enjoyed regional monopolies until a year ago, to become cost- effective and 
performance-conscious after the government partially liberalized the retail 
power market in March 2000.
However, the current scheme has so far failed to lure a large number of 
potential entrants because of the high transmission fees they must pay to 
conventional power companies. 
"What happened in overseas (power industries) suggest that the liberalization 
in Japan wouldn't only lower power rates but would also contribute to stable 
power supply significantly," said Tatsuo Hatta, professor of economics at the 
University of Tokyo. 
Compared with the U.S., Japanese electricity charges are typically twice as 
much for households and three times higher for industrial users. 
"There is a large discrepancy (in rates), and that is why we should hurriedly 
implement the liberalization," Hatta said. 
He said Japan's steep seasonal peak-load curve - one of the reasons the power 
companies cite as the cause of high power rates in Japan - can be altered 
once the prices are liberalized. "If power rates are set higher during those 
peak hours following the liberalization, users would refrain from using 
electricity." 
Steven Kean, executive vice president of the U.S. energy major, Enron Corp. 
(ENE), told the same seminar that Japan's power costs remain on the upward 
trend despite cost reductions in Europe and the U.S. 
He said Japan could achieve a cost-saving of Y4 trillion a year if its power 
prices fall to levels in Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development countries following the liberalization. 
Hatta and Kean were speaking at the seminar called "Reassessing Power 
Deregulation," which was co-sponsored by the Houston-based Enron. 

Hatta of the University of Tokyo said "it's very wise" that Japan has begun 
the deregulation with the "bilateral supply, or trade" system under which 
suppliers and users clinch deals directly. 
Under the current reforms, the sector for high-volume, large-lot industrial 
and commercial users - which represents only 30% of the Y15 trillion market - 
is opened to free competition. The government is to review the partial 
deregulation by 2003 for further deregulation. 
Japan should then introduce spot electricity trading such as futures and 
derivatives to alleviate risks of complicated price volatility for power 
providers, Hatta said. 
Hatta and other experts attending the seminar said further deregulation 
should destroy the systems that have supported the country's high power rates 
- regional monopolies and the fair rate return method, under which all costs 
are levied on prices. 
"There is absolutely no need to set the same (power) prices" nationwide, 
Hatta said. Power companies should make the opaque transmission fees 
transparent and set them accordingly with regional demand, he said. 
Yoshinori Omuro, vice president of Takashimaya Co.'s (J.TKA or 8233) 
management department, acknowledged the slow progress of the deregulation. 
Takashimaya, a major department store operator, has shifted to Diamond Power 
Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp. (J.MIB or 8058) as its 
power supplier at two of its 18 stores, with "strong back-up" from the 
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. 
"Despite the deregulation, the situation isn't where we can negotiate with 
power utilities to reduce (electricity costs). We have no choice but select 
independent power providers," Omuro said.

SINGAPORE: ANALYSIS-No Asia fallout seen from Enron's India woes.
By Cameron Dueck

05/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SINGAPORE, May 15 (Reuters) - A bitter payment battle between U.S. energy 
giant Enron Corp and authorities in India will serve as a reminder to foreign 
investors of the risks of putting money into emerging markets, analysts and 
bankers say. 
But it is unlikely to deter the flow of money into Asian electricity projects.
The pace of power privatisation and deregulation varies too greatly from 
country to country for the controversy in India to chill investment activity 
across Asia, they say. 
It does, however, underline the risks companies take despite some security 
offered by government payment guarantees. 
"Independant power producers (IPPs) will see Enron and Dabhol as an 
illustration of the dangers and possible risks of investing in an emerging 
market, but it would be going too far to say that other markets will be 
adversely affected because of it," said Philip Jackson, a banker with JP 
Morgan Chase in Hong Kong. 
Enron is on the verge of bailing out of an almost completed $2.9 billion 
power project because of a decade-long dispute with the troubled Maharashtra 
State Electricity Board (MSEB) over pricing and unpaid bills. 
MSEB has fallen about six months behind in paying for electricity supplied by 
Dabhol Power Co, the Indian unit of Houston-based Enron. 
The utility said last month that it had repaid about $28.6 million of the 
$48.2 million outstanding. 
The board of Dabhol has authorised the management to stop selling power to 
MSEB if the dispute is not resolved. Local media reports earlier in May said 
Enron was pulling executives out of India and relocating them elsewhere. 
Dabhol has invoked payment guarantees issued by the state and federal 
governments, but neither has stepped forward to foot the bill. 
GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES 
Banks often demand sponsor or host government guarantees to lessen risk 
before financing energy projects, which have long lead times and high capital 
expenditure. 
Governments are keen to provide guarantees to attract foreign investment. 
Guarantees may cover shortfalls in production, default of customer payment or 
even changes in market conditions. 
But such guarantees do not always provide the desired safety net and analysts 
said the legal systems in many emerging nations are simply not efficient 
enough to back these agreements. 
Enron's experience in India highlighted the risks of power investment in 
emerging countries and the unpredictability of government guarantees, they 
said. 
"Guarantees like that are painful for companies and for polititicians they're 
even more so," said John Vautrain, vice president at Purvin & Gertz in 
Singapore. 
"If the call is substantial, it's going to be bad." 
Robert Booth, director of the Bardak Group in West Perth, Australia, was more 
pessimistic and reckoned some companies might take a lead from Enron and shy 
away from emerging Asian nations. 
"Investors will pull back from these countries until they see that there is a 
properly functioning legal system that gives them assurance if they have to 
call in a government guarantee," Booth said.

Saudi Won't Announce Winners Of Gas Projs Tue - Report

05/15/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

MANAMA, Bahrain -(Dow Jones)- Saudi Arabia's supreme petroleum council is 
expected to hold a meeting Tuesday evening, but it's unlikely to declare its 
choice of international oil companies to participate in downstream gas 
projects, Arabic al-Hayat newspaper reported. 
The newspaper quoted sources at the government's technical committee 
overseeing the proposed projects as saying that the committee hasn't 
completed its final report concerning the oil companies' offers.
"Studies and recommendations haven't been completed yet and they need some 
time in order to present the project at its final structure, attached with 
recommendations from the technical committee," the sources said, according to 
the newspaper. 
However, the oil council "might endorse some balances concerning the offers," 
the newspaper said but didn't elaborate further. 
Sources in Saudi Arabia have said the oil companies were expected to be 
notified soon on whether they have been selected to participate in the gas 
projects. 
Saudi Arabia invited international oil companies in October 1998 to 
participate in proposals for downstream gas projects and upstream gas 
enhancement. 
After a series of meetings between the negotiating committee and the oil 
companies in the past year, several companies were shortlisted for each 
project. 
The companies shortlisted for Core Venture 1, the $15 billion South Ghawar 
Area Development were Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD), BP PLC (BP), Exxon Mobil 
Corp. (XOM), Chevron Corp. (CHV), Total Fina Elf S.A. (TOT) and ENI SpA (E). 
For Core Venture 2, the Red Sea Development, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Occidental 
Petroleum Corp. (OXY) are bidding jointly and Exxon Mobil, Total Fina Elf, 
Marathon Oil Canada Inc. (T.M), Shell and Conoco Inc. (COCA) were 
shortlisted. 
And for Core Venture 3, the Shaybah area, Total Fina Elf, Conoco, Phillips 
Petroleum (P), Enron and Occidental, Exxon Mobil, Shell and Marathon Oil were 
shortlisted.

MSEB refutes allegations by Enron, DPC
Girish Kuber

The Economic Times
Copyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)

MUMBAI 
THE MAHARASHTRA State Electricity Board on Monday in a letter to Enron 
refuted all allegations made against it by the company while invoking the 
political force majeure.
Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company on April 9 had invoked the political 
force majeure clause. DPC had indicated it was not in a position to fulfil 
its contractual obligations to MSEB because of political circumstances beyond 
its control. 
MSEB in a reply on Monday denied Enron's allegation of 'political 
circumstances' and said there was no reason why it should have felt insecure. 
"Such a step was necessary under the Power Purchase Agreement and related 
security documents to notify the board of 'certain events and to enforce our 
rights'," DPC had said. However, according to MSEB, such a step by DPC was 
uncalled for. 
For DPC, invoking the force majeure clause was necessary as 'certain events 
occurred that are beyond the reasonable control of the affected party (DPC)'. 
MSEB has expressed surprise in a letter on Monday. 
The energy major had dispatched the notice to MSEB, as an affected party, 
which had been subjected to "concerted, deliberate and politically motivated 
actions of state government, the Government of India and the Board, which 
will have a material and adverse effect on DPC's ability to perform 
obligations under PPA". 
"Given the cumulative effect of these political actions, DPC determined that 
the political force majeure declaration is an appropriate mechanism for 
providing that notice, and that is an appropriate and necessary step in 
protecting DPC and its stakeholders' rights," the statement added. 
However, for MSEB this was 'yet another move' from Enron to avoid paying Rs 
402 crore penalty the MSEB has slapped on it for failing to supply 
electricity as per the agreement. 
MSEB, in today's letter, reiterated its suggestion to adjust December 2000 
and Januray 2001 bills, against the Rs 800 crore penalty it has slapped on 
Enron for not supplying electricity as per demand. 
MSEB has refused to pay DPC's December 2000 and January 2001 bills worth Rs 
213 crore.

Saudi Supreme Petrol Council meeting to decide on huge gas project bids

05/15/2001
Business Recorder
Copyright (C) 2001 Business Recorder; Source: World Reporter (TM)

RIYADH : Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) is holding meetings 
on bids by 12 foreign oil majors for three giant gas projects and should take 
a decision shortly, a top oil official said on Monday. "The SPC has been 
discussing recommendations by the negotiating committee about the bids, and 
the meetings will continues executive president of the committee Abdulrahman 
al-Suhaibani told AFP. 
"It is not clear yet when the discussions will be completed and wham a final 
decision will be issued," added Suhaibani, who expected it to be soon. The 
meetings began two weeks ago.
A senior foreign oil executive in the kingdom expected an answer to his 
firm's bid by the end of this week or the start of next week. 
"The SPC is holding a crucial meeting today (Monday) and tomorrow. bin were 
told we would get an answer to our proposals either this weekend or early 
next week," the executive told AFP. 
The negotiating committee made detailed recommendations after meeting with 
the representative of 12 international oil companies (IOCs) which are bidding 
for the three multi-billion projects, the executive said. 
The committee, comprising ministers who are also SPC members, is headed by 
Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal. 
The gas projects, which would be the first foreign investment 
in the kingdom's energy sector since nationalisation in 1961, are located in 
the South Ghawar field near Al-Hufuf in the Eastern Province, Shaybah in the 
Empty Quarter desert, and the northern Red Sea area. 
They cover 440,000 square kilometres (176,000 square miles), making it the 
world's largest area for hydrocarbon investment. 
US majors Enron and Occidental in a joint bid, as well as Chevron, 
Conocokilometres, ExxonMobil, Marathon, Phillips and Texaco have been 
shortlisted for the Saudi projects. Rounding out the list are European firms 
BP Amoco, Eni, Royal Dutch Shell and TotalFinaElf. 
ExxonMobil, Shell and TotalFinaElf are in the bidding for all three ventures. 
The investment involves gas exploration and production, setting up 
petrochemical industries and power and water desalination plants. 
The projects, called the natural gas initiative, are to be carried out 
simultaneously by consortia of two to three firms in cooperation with Aramco, 
the national oil company, on long-term basis for up to 30 years, the 
executive said. 
Aramco has been working to double the Saudi gas network's capacity from the 
current 3.5 billion cubic feet (105 million cubic metres) per day to seven 
billion cubic feet (210 million metres) daily in 2004. 
Saudi Arabia, which sits on top of the world's biggest oil reserves, has 
proven natural gas reserves of 220 trillion cubic feet (6.6 trillion cubic 
metres).-AFP

i think thats rite -think curve flattens somewhat.back end the overvalued
part for now. i think we more consolidate sideways choppy for a few sessions
but if the present  rate of injections continue the end users/utilties will
have to stop buying cuz of real phys limitations to take the gas into
storage. funds short but only 6% of open int and have covered later part of
last week.
  think vol comes in again too.i think it sale 4.50 scale up-talked to some
others to o thinking it cant go below 4.00 so i actually think more the
suprise in the short term for a break of 4.00!! so who knows/cud work the
other way.
   agree-disappointed at lack of producer selling-we had one deal come thur
but its been worked for months so not price relevant.
  when are you in town next?

indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will
get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for

John,
Following up on yesterday, there are two additional considerations. 

First, with regard to the idea of curtailing gas input at the Topock 
liquefaction plant, the pipeline bottleneck is actually downstream of the 
plant, so that wouldn't help. 

Second, it seems there are more of these "portable pipeline" units floating 
around than I thought. Besides the inoperable unit in Amarillo, both Transgas 
(in Massachusetts) and Minnigasco may have at least one. Moreover, PG&E has 
one at the end of a long lateral line on its system just south of Sacramento. 
Apparently it uses it mostly to augment linepack. The specs of that unit are 
about 4 times higher than the Amarillo one: it puts out 400,000 cubic 
feet/hour (about 9.6 mmcf/d or almost one contract) at 150 psi. As I said 
yesterday, these units are the only way that you could get gas into the 
pipeline system in California. 

This information I got from Jeff Beale, who runs CH-IV, a small-scale LNG 
consultant. He said that he'd had some similar calls about LNG, and also that 
he'd be willing to help Enron source equipment if we were really interested 
in looking further into transporting LNG into California. 

Assuming that we could get a few "portable pipelines" and some trucks, there 
are five liquefaction plants that could most conveniently supply LNG:

Location Owner  Liquefaction Capacity (gal/day)  Capacity (mmcf/d) Storage 
(gal) Storage (mmcf)
Topock, AZ ElPaso/ALT 90,000      7.4   100,000  8.2
LaPlata, CO Williams 20,000     1.64   100,000  8.2
Sacramento   57,600     4.72   132,000  10.8
LaBarge, WY Exxon  60,000     4.92      
Evanston, WY Amoco  95,000     7.8   100,000  8.2

Totals         26.48

Whether these plants have spare LNG to sell us is another question. The 
Sacramento plant, which I mentioned yesterday, is supposedly dedicated to 
providing methane for laboratory purposes. The others may have contracts with 
LNG fleet owners. 

I'll check back with you later today about the outcome of your meeting.

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Thank you,

I know it will be close to impossible to get out but I wanted to invite you 
to our Christmas party on Dec 20 here in NYC- we'd love if you came.  If not, 
in the new year, I hope we can set something up where you meet some of the 
new funds we are dealing and have some fun up here.

I met someone good to work with you guys at this last Super Saturday- David 
Larson- Berkeley- good derivatives, trading knowledge, personable.  I'll fax 
through resume- we are making him an offer for the analyst pool.

Thanks for all you help always,
Caroline
