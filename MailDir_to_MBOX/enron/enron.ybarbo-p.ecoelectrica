Mariella,

Attached is a spreadsheet that calculates the Energy Payment received from PREPA and the cost of LNG from Cabot for the year 2001. It can also be used  for future years. A not-so-obvious revelation from the attached calculations is that for the year 2000, the Energy payment and the cost of LNG per kwh are equal if the heat rate for Eco @ 100% dispatch is 7473 BTU/kwh (i.e., before application of the Fuel Cost Correction Curve). Since Eco's heat rate at 100% of 507MW is lower than 7473 BTU/kwh, the PPA pays a little above the actual fuel cost. 

I will be happy to review this with you or with Remi. Also, I will FAX to you the handwritten pages mentioned. 

Regards,

Paul

M,

One of the papers you reference was prepared by Paul Y'Barbo, the other by me.  In essence, as long as the PR-CPI is higher than the basis, we maintain a positive energy margin.  I am not sure I can find the documents - they may be in my new office or in the files I have asked Cynthia to keep in a file cabinet on your floor - last time I was on your floor they were still in boxes.

Paul - please see if you have the documents Mariella is asking for.  If you are not sure what she is talking about, please contact her and provide what she needs (you may have to reproduce the mathematical equations).

Rick

Hi Rick,
Believe it or not it was only two days ago that I threw away the analysis you performed for me when I asked the question of: is Eco exposed to fuel risk because it's PPA energy pricing formula (including indexing) appears different than its LNG cost formula (including indexing)?  I know the conclusion reached by you, Doug R. and the folks from ECT who helped put the transaction together at the time was: No.  In fact, we have a small positive energy margin.  Conditions would almost have to be unimaginable for the margin to become negative, etc.  

In today's staff meeting I was asked to involve Remi Collongues (he heads our trading efforts in Brazil) in taking a look at the revenue-cost aspects of our LNG project in Puerto Rico to confirm or correct the conclusions reached earlier.  Do you still have a copy of the analysis you prepared for me?  It was a hand-written analysis together with copies of the pertinent PPA and FSA provisions. 

Thanks in advance. Mariella

Paul,

When the Hub goes below $3.50 it becomes difficult. At <$3.00 probably no 
takers.

Jaime-
I am just going by the contract which shows two banking days after receipt of 
invoice.  There is no way to get a payment out today, as it takes a day or 
two to work invoices through our system.  How about if I pay it the way the 
contract stipulates and if there is a difference to be settled, we can net it 
against our next fuel management payment?

The price was reduced to accomodate a transfer of funds two days after 
completion of discharge. The final discharge was completed on March 11th, 
therefore we were expecting to see the money today. Therefore, if payment is 
not until Thursday we should be increasing the price.

Jaime,

Seems like this could be a good deal for Eco. The pricing seems reasonable to me given the fact that Peerless will have money tied up on inventory that we will seldom use.

Questions:

1. what is the going rate for leasing tank capacity in the area?

2. will Peerless be storing No.2 (that meets our quality specs) in tanks in addition to Eco's? Do they plan to transfer diesel back and forth between those tanks? If so, how do we control quality?

3. how much Minimum Inventory will Peerless agree to? The more the better for Eco.


Note: The Platt's Index is Low Sulfur No.2 U.S. Gulf Coast - Waterborne

Dan - comments?

Roberto,

Below are some observations: 

For the year 2000 (ignoring October), EcoElectrica sold power to PREPA for:

Capacity:	$0.037/kwh
Energy:		$0.026/kwh
Total:		$0.063/kwh


In 2001 Jan-April:

Capacity:	$0.049/kwh	increase of $0.012/kwh (+32.4%)
Energy:		$0.037/kwh	increase of $0.011/kwh (+42.3%)
Total:		$0.086/kwh

The increase in energy payment mirrors the increase in fuel cost for 2001 versus 2000. Cabot contract LNG Commodity Charge increased 50% from $2.32/MMBtu to $3.48/MMBtu in 2001.

However, the per unit increase in Capacity Payment is almost entirely due to PREPA dispatching Eco at a lower % of availability in 2001. Additionally, PREPA has been offered kwh's above a 76% dispatch for $5.80/MMBtu or $0.0435/kwh but has not purchased them. If PREPA were to dispatch Eco at 88%, I estimate that their total purchase cost of all kwh's purchased would be $0.074/kwh in 2001.

Also, it is not an Apples-to-Apples comparison when PREPA compares their cost of generation using fuel cost only to our cost of generation that includes return of investment capital as well as fuel cost.   

Let me know if you want to discuss further.

Paul

The attached spreadsheet allows you to easily calculate Eco's year-end LNG 
inventory for a variety of cases that vary dispatch rate, # days of outage 
for CT1, and number of cargoes diverted between now and year-end. Simply 
enter your assumption for number of days of CT1 outage in cell A16 and the 
number of cargoes you want to divert in cell A23. The year-end inventory is 
automatically calculated. A negative number means that you require more LNG 
than you are entitled to receive.

Assuming that you want the LNG tank full at year-end:

1. Eco will be able to receive 100% of the remaining 6 cargoes if the CT1 
outage is 60 days or less

2. 175 days of CT1 outage are required to result in Eco being able to divert 
1 cargo and still have a full tank at year-end

3. a 60-175 day outage for CT1 results in surplus LNG but whether or not it 
is enough to market depends on how much the outage exceeds 60 days

The above figures assume a 76% dispatch and 95% availability on days that Eco 
is not assumed to be in an outage.


Paul

These Letters of Prtotest are simply standard proceedure for ships in the 
trade and mean nothing unless we cause a delay beyond our allowed laytime 
(which we did not).  Even if we had exceeded our laytime, it is not usual to 
respond to these protests.  Instead we would document our side internally and 
wait for any demurrage claim which might arise.

As to the "Hilli", the last ETA at Lake Charles was Apr 18-19,  I will keep 
you updated of any changes.  I will also pass on Hector and Victor's names to

Chris-
We agree with your calculation for the reconciliation for the year 2000 with 
a net amount due Enron of $187,351.39.  Per our agreement, we will short pay 
the April 2001 demand charge invoice (inv # 01040001)by this amount.  The net 
amount we will pay on this invoice is as follows:
 Amount due on Apr '01 Dem Charge $1,914,760.56
 Credit from 2000 Reconciliation  <$187,351.39>
 Net due April 17, 2001   $1,727,409.17

You can send us the actual credit invoice for our records next week when you 
get back.

Thanks and regards,
Dan Masters

Here is the last email I have.
The difference with regards to the shipment on 13-14th September., is that
the figure you were using(2,630,718mmbtus) was calculated using the disport
analysis, instead of the load port analysis which is how all of the other
reports are calculated. I will fax you a copy of the  report.

Chris,

I have reviewed your reconciliation spreadsheet and have discovered a
discrepapancy  regarding the "Matthew" delivery on September 14, 2000.  It
appears that a volume, other than the discharge volume, is being applied to
calculate the average heating value.  My calculations show that the average
heating value for this Setpember 14 delivery should be 22.47, as opposed to
22.61.
Despite this one discrepancy, we match perfectly.
I have attached my reconciliation spreadsheet below for your convenience.
I show that Cabot owes EcoElectrica $209,472.88.
Please review and let me know if you are in agreement.
Regards,

Dustin Collins

Based on today's closing NYMEX prices there is $1.9 MM of price difference 
between EcoElectrica's 2002 Winter Cargo Commodity Charge plus Commodity 
Surcharge and the delivered cost of 83,000 CBM of LNG. That is $5.61 vs 
$4.61. This assumes we pay a day rate of $50,000/day for the vessel, Jan '02 
NYMEX is $5.41, and the FOB price for LNG is $2.66. 

Let's stay in touch about the possibilty of landing a spot cargo into Puerto 
Rico in January. As we discussed, how we play this with Cabot is a big issue. 
There could be an additional $4.7 MM of value that could be captured by Eco 
if Cabot were unable to release its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo. 
Also, let's continue to think about how we make the logistics work and how we 
can get Cabot's cooperation if needed.

Also, note that Eco may need 2 cargoes of this size to make it until the 
Early Spring Cargo.

Larry,

The approach speed indicator you refer to that is currently used is not 
intrinsically safe and should not be approved for use by the FERC or USCG. 
The system we are recommending is similar to the one being used in India and 
other ports and is an integrated system. The additional cost of including the 
approach speed indicator with the tension monitoring and quick release is 
minimal compared to an incident. Larry Snyder and Tony Galt can give you more 
information on the need for this and the cost effectiveness.

Larry - Please add your comments/corrections and forward on to Victor. 

Approach velocity metering is currently hand held and portable and will  
remain so. ?No permanent equipment is planned for installation. ?The purpose  
of the equipment is to measure the ship's approach velocity as it is nearing  
the mooring position. ?The velocity should not exceed 6 inches per second as  
it contacts the breasting dolphins. ?If the ship were to impact the dock at 
a  
greater velocity, then a subsequent inspection should be performed to  
ascertain whether or not damage to pier pilings had occurred. 

The metered mooring hooks have been recommended but not specified nor  
procured. ?The metered hooks would allow close monitoring of ship's forces 
on  
the dock during unloading and the data would allow for the ship to adjust  
forces on the dock, and this controlling the ship's position, by precise  
application/use of ballast and intermediate adjustment of mooring lines. 
This  
feature, by providing precise information on the forces (and motion) of the  
ship relative to the dock would allow for greater precision in positioning 
of  
the ship at the optimum vertical and horizontal position relative to the  
unloading arms and avoidance of undue forces on the unloading arms. 
This feature would reduce likelyhood of perc valves discharging and  
disconnecting of the ship during unloading. ?In summary, it's an information  
system that provides for a higher level of control of the unloading process. 

Regards,

Javier,

Attached is the memo Greg was referring to. We can discuss when you want. No $ value was calculated for these potential opportunities. I would imagine that the calculations would be very complex (if possible to do at all).

I thought of 1 more type of opportunity that could arise. If U.S. natural gas prices fall from one year to the next, Eco may be better off buying spot LNG rather than buying LNG from Cabot at the contract price. We are looking at this for the Year 2002.

Paul

Gentlemen,

As our March cargo has been diverted to Lake Charles I do not see the need 
for a conference call today. I will nominate tentative date for April and May 
which we can revise next month. As an  indication I will nominate the 1-5 
April followed by another cargo 35-40 days later. These dates are consistent 
with the current planned outage and a dispatch rate of between 76% and 85%. 
If anybody has and any questions or comments please let me know.

If the last Hoegh Galleon cargo of this year is diverted to Puerto Rico, the economics of sending non-Cabot LNG to Puerto Rico are different than those mentioned in my prior note.

Based on current prices, there is $0.7 MM of value that could be captured between Enron LNG and Eco on the diversion. This represents the price difference between what it would cost to buy back our sale to ENA at CMS and what Eco would have had to pay Cabot for a Winter Cargo. If CMS would let us out of the terminal fee or let it apply to a future delivery, that would add an additional $1 MM of value. If Cabot had to give up its Demand Charge and Demand Surcharge (hard to imagine) on the Winter Cargo, that adds another $4.7 MM.

A second Hoegh Galleon cargo should add $1.5 MM but would need to be sourced from Nigeria or Algeria(???). 

Cabot controls the date of the Last Cargo delivered in 2001. It can be November 23-December 15 (unless another date is mutually agreeable). The date of this last delivery determines the earliest date that Eco would be able to receive the Hoegh Galleon. The earliest that Eco could receive the Hoegh Galleon should therefore be between December 20 and January 11 - depends on Cabot. 

Eco would be able to receive a second Hoegh Galleon cargo as soon as 29 days after the first Hoegh Galleon cargo delivery or as late as 45 days after. Two Hoegh Galleon cargoes should give Eco enough fuel (barely) to get them to the dates where they are eligible to receive the Early Spring cargo (100 days after the Last Cargo of 2001). 

In addition to the $$$'s available to be captured, this program removes Eco's risk of not receiving a Winter Cargo from Cabot.

Economics and Timing -  The amount of value to be captured is most heavily influenced by December-January NYMEX prices. These impact our cost to buy back gas at the CMS tailgate and our cost to buy the second Hoegh Galleon cargo. Our gas cost is more subject to change than is the Cabot contract price we are trying to beat. If we had a crystal ball, we would lock-in the economics of the diversion and of the purchase of the second cargo when the NYMEX bottoms-out. The front of the price curve has lost ~$1.00/MMBtu in the last 2 weeks. Where will it go from here?

In order to be prepared to execute when market conditions are right, we need to get Eco on board and initiate discussions with a producer about supply for the second cargo. Also, we should talk with Gene Massey to confirm that the contract says what we think it says and to get his thoughts on what we are trying to do.

I would appreciate any insights that you may have regarding this opportunity.

Regards,

Paul

Rudy-
In the contract it says that nominations for the following month are firm 
while the 60 and 90 day ranges are just estimates.  Since taking delivery of 
the smaller ship causes us to nominate another cargo within the same month, 
we were stipulating that only the first nomination is firm as the contract 
defines it.  With all that being said, we are still planning on working 
together as usual for a  schedule that works for both sides.
Regards,
Dan

Phil,

Yesterday we had our call to nominate the April LNG ship delivery.

We decided to nominate our five day window between April 4 thru 8.  PREPA is 
forecasting a 75% dispatch thru that period.  If the dispatch is 75%, we 
forecast that we would be running out of LNG about on the 8th.  Typically, we 
nominate with a few days cushion against the late delivery date.  We decided 
not to have a few days cushion for  the following reasons:

1. We avoid a cash flow shortfall of between $1-5 million (depending on the 
ship size) prior to April 16, 2001.

2. Inventory projections are based on 100% power plant availability.

3. Based on lastest loading schedules, Cabot is expected to respond with 
April4-6 delivery window.

4. There is sufficient LPG available to cover several days of LPG operation.

5. In the event that PREPA dispatches higher than 76% (and exposes themselves 
to SFP), volumes that we have made available to PREPA are priced at 
$6.75/mmBtu, which should cover our LPG costs.  Additionally, the volumes 
made available would only allow dispatch at about 87%.  We are prepared, if 
necessary, to significantly increase the price of any additional volumes made 
available to discourage dispatch above 87%.

Although our nomination should take care of a cash flow shortfall in April, 
we will have a problem in May (prior to May 17, 2001) unless we receive 
insurance money.  If we have a problem in May, it is not clear to me that we 
will be able to draw on the DSR as debt service payments are due only in 
March, June, September, and December.

Our insurance strategy must now include getting at least a partial payment in 
April.  Jaime please undate the cash flow (we will need this to address the 
Lenders recent request for an update) and advise us of our options assuming 
we will have a cash flow shortfall in May.

Rick

Item 5 under Significant Plant Modifications Proposed says you are  examining 
design changes required to install a mooring line tension meter and  ship 
approach velocity meter on the dock(???).
?
What is the rationale for why you feel these two items are needed and can  
you tell me how they work and what happens if they measure beyond some set  
point.? What are the set points you want to measure and why??  Thanks.

Good Morning Puri:  We have been diligently working on your below request, and
can now offer the following instructions.

Next Loading date for Pt Fortin currently scheduled for AM of 30 March 2001.  
As
for heel quantity, we must take into account the  transit  (8 days) from 
Boston
to Pt Fortin, and still allow for sufficient heel to keep tanks cold on 
arrival,
I suggest in way of 1000 cubic meters, and ask for Masters input in this 
regard.

Expected unloading date at Penuelas is 02 April 2001.  Vessel should plan on
departing Pt Fortin Am of 31st March and adjust speed so as to arrive Penuelas
Pilot Station at 0530/0600 02 April.

As always, noon position reports are requested, and the normal points of 
contact
at ALNG and Cabot be advised.

Upon departure Boston on 22 March, Master must make notification directly to
ECOELECTRICA, and our Agents in Puerto Rico (Luis-Ayala) providing ETA to both
Pt Fortin to Load, and then further ETA to Penuelas.  Noon reports on ballast
voyage to Pt Fortin, and loaded voyage to Penuelas must also copy ECO, and
Ayala.

I know the Master has all of the relevant POC information for the above, so I
will not include it here.  Should you have any further questions, please so 
not
hesitate.


Best Regards
Joe McKechnie

Rudy-
Per our conversation last week, the "Methane Arctic" will be delivered on
to EcoElectrica on April 2, but you had mentioned the possibility of
adjusting the due date for the invoice.  We didn't discuss an exact date,
but the plant would like to see a due due date of April 17 if that works
for you.  Please advise.

I have been asked by the plant to request that the payment terms for the

If the last Hoegh Galleon cargo of this year is diverted to Puerto Rico, the 
economics of sending non-Cabot LNG to Puerto Rico are different than those 
mentioned in my prior note.

Based on current prices, there is $0.7 MM of value that could be captured 
between Enron LNG and Eco on the diversion. This represents the price 
difference between what it would cost to buy back our sale to ENA at CMS and 
what Eco would have had to pay Cabot for a Winter Cargo. If CMS would let us 
out of the terminal fee or let it apply to a future delivery, that would add 
an additional $1 MM of value. If Cabot had to give up its Demand Charge and 
Demand Surcharge (hard to imagine) on the Winter Cargo, that adds another 
$4.7 MM.

A second Hoegh Galleon cargo should add $1.5 MM but would need to be sourced 
from Nigeria or Algeria(???). 

Cabot controls the date of the Last Cargo delivered in 2001. It can be 
November 23-December 15 (unless another date is mutually agreeable). The date 
of this last delivery determines the earliest date that Eco would be able to 
receive the Hoegh Galleon. The earliest that Eco could receive the Hoegh 
Galleon should therefore be between December 20 and January 11 - depends on 
Cabot. 

Eco would be able to receive a second Hoegh Galleon cargo as soon as 29 days 
after the first Hoegh Galleon cargo delivery or as late as 45 days after. Two 
Hoegh Galleon cargoes should give Eco enough fuel (barely) to get them to the 
dates where they are eligible to receive the Early Spring cargo (100 days 
after the Last Cargo of 2001). 

In addition to the $$$'s available to be captured, this program removes Eco's 
risk of not receiving a Winter Cargo from Cabot.

Economics and Timing -  The amount of value to be captured is most heavily 
influenced by December-January NYMEX prices. These impact our cost to buy 
back gas at the CMS tailgate and our cost to buy the second Hoegh Galleon 
cargo. Our gas cost is more subject to change than is the Cabot contract 
price we are trying to beat. If we had a crystal ball, we would lock-in the 
economics of the diversion and of the purchase of the second cargo when the 
NYMEX bottoms-out. The front of the price curve has lost ~$1.00/MMBtu in the 
last 2 weeks. Where will it go from here?

In order to be prepared to execute when market conditions are right, we need 
to get Eco on board and initiate discussions with a producer about supply for 
the second cargo. Also, we should talk with Gene Massey to confirm that the 
contract says what we think it says and to get his thoughts on what we are 
trying to do.

I would appreciate any insights that you may have regarding this opportunity.

Regards,

Paul

Oscar-
These Letters of Prtotest are simply standard proceedure for ships in the trade and mean nothing unless we cause a delay beyond our allowed laytime (which we did not).  Even if we had exceeded our laytime, it is not usual to respond to these protests.  Instead we would document our side internally and wait for any demurrage claim which might arise.

As to the "Hilli", the last ETA at Lake Charles was Apr 18-19,  I will keep you updated of any changes.  I will also pass on Hector and Victor's names to Cabot for clearance to attend.

  The restriction and delay mentioned in the document,  were extraordinary events, caused by equipment malfunction, our operators did,
   their best effort to perform the transfer as fast and safe as usual. The transfer operation began on 4-05-01 at 12.20 PM and was finished at
   3:26 AM on 4-06-01, a total of 15 hours. The Contract grant 30 hours for this  operation, reason why this LOP doesn't proceeds   

PD. Let  me  know the most  recent ETA of the HILLI to Lake Charles on April . Victor Vega and   Hector Vega / PIC  will be at the discharge to survey the operation and get enought information to satisfy,  EcoElectrica  Safety and  Operating Procedures.

Clay,

We expect to get Eco's OK, on Thursday, to give Cabot notice that Eco has the opportunity to purchase "replacement fuel" rather than purchasing the Cabot contract 2002 Winter Cargo. Current Henry Hub prices indicate that diversion of the last 2001 Hoegh Galleon cargo to Puerto Rico makes economic sense. We are studying the logistical issues.

A second Hoegh Galleon size cargo will be needed, most likely in February. When can Dan and I visit with you to discuss the prospects for arranging this February cargo? We'd like to know about product availability, how long can we wait to set the load dates, and will the previous pricing formula used by OLNG apply to Puerto Rico?

Cabot has 10 days to respond to the notice. Eco can buy spot LNG, regardless of Cabot's response. Cabot's response primarily determines whether or not Eco must pay $4.7MM in demand charge and demand surcharge.

Best Regards,

Paul

Below are the key points of a conference call held on Friday, May 11, 2001. Attending were Gene Massey of Arent Fox and Coralina Rivera, Dan Masters, and Paul Y'Barbo of Enron. The call was in reference to the LNG supply contract between EcoElectrica and Cabot LNG. Enron LNG got the answers it hoped to get and more.

1. Article 12.3 gives Cabot the right to not deliver a Winter Cargo to Eco if Cabot is unable to complete an Algerian Loading within a window specified in the contract. Cabot could give notice to Eco as late as 3 days prior to the scheduled loading of the Winter Cargo that Cabot will be unable to deliver the cargo. The failure to complete the Algerian Loading must not be the result of a default by Cabot or Distrigas. The failure to achieve an Algerian Loading may not necessarily be the result of an Algerian Force Majeure situation. 

2. Article 12.3 (b) (iv) gives Eco the right to secure replacement fuel for the Winter Cargo. If Eco notices Cabot that Eco has the opportunity to secure replacement fuel, then Cabot has 10 days to notify Eco whether or not they are willing to release the right to not deliver the Winter Cargo. Eco may buy replacement fuel regardless of whether or not Cabot releases the right to not deliver the Winter Cargo. In other words, even if Cabot commits to delivery of a Winter Cargo, Eco is under no obligation to purchase a Winter Cargo from Cabot. 

If Cabot is unable to release its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo, then Eco will buy the replacement fuel and will not have to pay the Demand Charge or Demand Surcharge on the Winter Cargo, a quantity equal to 119,000 cubic meters (~$4.7 MM).

If Cabot releases its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo and Eco still buys the replacement fuel, then Eco will receive no reduction in the annual Demand Charges and Demand Surcharge.

Eco has until December 1st to give notice that it has the opportunity to buy replacement fuel. It was Gene's opinion that the sooner Eco gives notice (today would be good), the less likely Cabot would be willing to give up its right to not deliver the Winter Cargo. Thus, the more likely Eco would be able to get a reduction in Demand Charges and elimination of the Demand Surcharge.

Important Note: The economics of the deal work such that the largest monetary benefit of buying replacement fuel exists when December/January/February U.S. natural gas prices are at their lowest point of the year.

If U.S. natural gas prices were to go down a little further, Eco would want to buy more non-Cabot LNG than just the Winter Cargo replacement.

3. Per Article 7.5, Eco's annual purchase commitment is 66% of the LNG consumed at the Power Facility up to a maximum of 19.46 TBtu (~7 Standard Cargoes). In a year in which the Power Facility consumes 9 Standard Cargoes, Eco would need to "purchase" 6 Standard Cargoes from Cabot. Failure to do so would result in payment of liquidated damages of approximately $0.36/MMBtu.

Important Note: Per Article 7.5, if replacement fuel is purchased rather than buying a Winter Cargo from Cabot, that quantity counts as though it were purchased from Cabot for the purpose of assessing whether or not Eco met its annual purchase commitment. Thus, in a year in which the Power Facility consumes 9 Standard Cargoes, Eco could buy replacement fuel instead of a Cabot Winter Cargo plus 5 Standard Cargoes from Cabot and still meet its annual commitment.

There are benefits to Eco for buying replacement fuel - certainty of supply and a lower price. Enron LNG should continue to pursue a deal with Eco. I plan to schedule a meeting with Mariella Mahan as soon as she is available.

I will provide an update of the economics of this trade in my next e-mail.

The "Matthew" discharged 2,702,390 MMBtu at Lake Charles.  After taking out 
the 1.75% terminal fuel expense, we will have 2,655,098 available for our 
sale to ENA.  We have sold ENA 2,666,000 for March on this deal, so we need 
to buy 10,902 MMBtu to cover the shortage.

Chris-
We agree with your calculation for the reconciliation for the year 2000 with a net amount due Enron of $187,351.39.  Per our agreement, we will short pay the April 2001 demand charge invoice (inv # 01040001)by this amount.  The net amount we will pay on this invoice is as follows:
	Amount due on Apr '01 Dem Charge	$1,914,760.56
	Credit from 2000 Reconciliation		<$187,351.39>
	Net due April 17, 2001			$1,727,409.17

You can send us the actual credit invoice for our records next week when you get back.

Thanks and regards,
Dan Masters

Here is the last email I have.
The difference with regards to the shipment on 13-14th September., is that
the figure you were using(2,630,718mmbtus) was calculated using the disport
analysis, instead of the load port analysis which is how all of the other
reports are calculated. I will fax you a copy of the  report.

Regards
Chris

Chris,

I have reviewed your reconciliation spreadsheet and have discovered a
discrepapancy  regarding the "Matthew" delivery on September 14, 2000.  It
appears that a volume, other than the discharge volume, is being applied to
calculate the average heating value.  My calculations show that the average
heating value for this Setpember 14 delivery should be 22.47, as opposed to
22.61.
Despite this one discrepancy, we match perfectly.
I have attached my reconciliation spreadsheet below for your convenience.
I show that Cabot owes EcoElectrica $209,472.88.
Please review and let me know if you are in agreement.
Regards,

Dustin Collins

Subject: Methane Artic Discharge 2/12-13

The discharge of the LNG cargo was sucessfully completed this morning at 
approximately 5:30 AM.  The ship sailed at around 9 AM today.  Below are the 
highlights of discharge.

At around 1:20 AM the UPS system (Uninterruptible Power Supply system) failed 
causing loss of power to alarm and control system.  This activated ESD and 
unloading was safely shutdown with no problems.  It took approximately 2 
hours to identify the UPS system as the problem, bypass the UPS so power was 
supplied directly from line (not through UPS) and restart pumps to full rate 
unloading.  Bypassing UPS only required throwing switch to line setting as 
system is set up to accommodate problems with UPS.  Eco will investigation 
the UPS system to correct the problem.
Eco had planned on loading liquid nitrogen (LN2) to the ship before cargo 
discharge started.  Eco had a preliminary procedure they had prepared for LN2 
loading.  Coast Guard had not reviewed a procedure for LN2 loading so wanted 
staff to review the document before LN2 loading.  It was agreed LNG unloading 
would proceed and LN2 loading would occur after cargo discharge was 
completed.  A copy of procedure was sent to Coast Guard's San Juan office for 
staff review.  Within  2 hours the Coast Guard had approved loading the 
liquid nitrogen after the cargo discharge was completed.  Eco will prepare an 
official procedure and submit it to the Coast Guard as an addition to the 
procedures previously submitted.
Eco had pre-cooled the LN2 line in preparation for loading onto the ship.  
The line was allowed to warm up and cooldown occurred the next morning (13th) 
during the cargo ratedown.  Once the last cargo pump was shutdown the loading 
of LN2 began.  The LN2 transfer went very slowly.  The Methane Artic used a 1 
and 1/2 inch stainless hose to connect Eco's loading line to ship's 
manifold.  Eco's line is a 3".  It was obvious the ship was in a hurry so 
they decided that after increasing the level in one of its' two tanks by 
approx. 11% that they had enough LN2 and ceased the loading operation.  
Disconnection of the vapor and LN2 lines were completed and the ship sailed 
shortly thereafter.  The ship loaded very little LN2 and obviously didn't 
really need much although they were low (only 29%  in one tank).  
There were several minor leaks at flanges in the LN2 loading system.  Leaks 
were small and nitrogen safe so loading was not stopped for warming up line 
and tightening the bolts.  These leaks were identified and flanges will be 
tightened during the next week.
With the problems of the UPS failure the operators forgot to shutdown the 
sample collection system.  This will probably result in a bad composite 
sample.  I have already discussed with Victor Vega the need to have a person 
only follow the LNG sample collection and analysis during the entire period 
of the cargo discharge.  They would have no other responsibility.  I had 
previous had discussion with the Eco chemist Luz regarding a testing program 
to take place after this discharge to give additional support to prove the 
sample system works.  I will follow up this week to ensure test takes place 
within the next week.  I will need Eco's management support with scheduling 
this.

Subject: Methane Aritc Discharge 2/12-12

One item I forgot to mention was that there was high winds for approx. 45 
minutes during the early part of the cargo discharge (around 3-4 PM) on the 
12th.  Wind speed gusted to 38 knots.  The guidelines given to the coast 
guard for wind speeds was a sustained wind speed of 30.8 knots for stopping 
cargo discharge.  When the winds came up to the 30.8 Eco started discussions 
with ship's chief mate and contacted local weather agency to get an idea of 
weather forcast.  Winds were not expected to remain at the extremely high 
level for very long and ship maintained itself alongside, so the discharge 
continued with constant monitoring of the situation..  If it had been a 
Moss-Rosenburg design ship, I would have recommended that Eco shut down the 
unloading until the winds subsided.  

The Coast Guard rep. was aware of the conversations which took place between 
the ship and shore and was pleased with how Eco handled the situation.

Rudy-
Per our conversation today, the invoice for the "Hilli" delivery will be due no earlier than May 17,  2001.  If under normal payment terms the invoice would be due later than May 17, then the regular due date would prevail.

Thanks for your help,

Rudy-
I have been asked by the plant to request that the payment terms for the "Hilli" be extended.  Since the delivery is earlier than Eco needs the product,  they would request that the invoice be due on May 17.  Please advise if this is agreeable.

Thanks,

Oscar,

Per our conversation, the following are the fuel management team's 
assumptions of fuel requirements for Eco at 100% of capacity:

LNG   91,260 MMBtu/day at 507 MW    Heat Rate = 7500 BTU/kwh

LPG   1905 Metric Tons at 507 MW     Heat Rate = 7461 BTU/kwh    (Note: 522 
gallons/MT   ,   91,300 Btu/gallon)

No.2   619,000 gallons/day at 465 MW   Heat Rate = 7313 BTU/kwh    (Note: 
131,850 Btu/gallon)


Heat rates at less than 100% of capacity will be different from those at 
100%. Check with Rick or Arthur regarding performance curves.

Call me if you have any additional questions.


Regards,

Paul

Jaime-
I am just going by the contract which shows two banking days after receipt
of invoice.  There is no way to get a payment out today, as it takes a day
or two to work invoices through our system.  How about if I pay it the way
the contract stipulates and if there is a difference to be settled, we can
net it against our next fuel management payment?

Dan:

The price was reduced to accomodate a transfer of funds two days after
completion of discharge. The final discharge was completed on March 11th,
therefore we were expecting to see the money today. Therefore, if payment
is not until Thursday we should be increasing the price.

This is the language that has been approved for the notice we would give to Cabot if we decide to notify them about replacing the Winter Cargo:

	Persuant to clause 12.3(b)(iv) of the LNG contract, EcoElectrica
	hereby gives notice to Cabot that it has the opportunity to secure
	replacement fuel for the 2002 Winter Cargo.

	If EcoElectrica does not receive, within the 10-day period allowed, a
	release by Cabot LNG of all rights it has under Section 12.3 not to deliver
	the 2002 Winter Cargo, that cargo shall be deleted from the ACQ and the
	other adjustments made as provided in Section 12.3(iv).

	Pursuant to Article 18, please acknowledge receipt of this notice.

Did the EXCOM group give approval to give the notice?  If so, we need to get together to discuss what to do next.

DWT         66,200
Five Cargo tanks with ten cargo pumps
16 Inch liquid and vapor connections
Parallel Mid-body fwd from manifold c/l of vapor line = 38.9 meters
Parallel Mid-body aft from manifold c/l of vapor line = 73.2 meters
Ships side to manifold flange face = 3.5 meters
Manifold height above ballast draught = 15 meters
Distance between manifold connection c/l's = 2.52 meters

I will provide you both with further information in regards to the ESD
connection soonest, but I can confirm her connections work in Lake Charles.

Please let me know who will be your point of contact for this at the Eco
Terminal.

Thank You and Best Regards

Rudy-
Confirming our conversation this morning, we have agreed that Cabot will provide the notices to EcoElectrica per section 7.1(a) of the LNG supply contract on or before July 16, 2001 instead of June 1, 2001.  EcoElectrica will then provide its notices per the same section on or before August 16, 2001 instead of July 1, 2001.

Thanks and regards,
Dan Masters

I've clarified the language in 2(a).

Paul / Dan:

A summary of the alternatives related to the LNG winter cargo follows:

	1. If we don't do anything and Cabot does not deliver: 
		a. We may save $4.7 million in demand charges and surcharges, but will have exposure to spot fuel prices at a time when prices are expected to rise.

	2. Write a letter to Cabot notifying them that we have an opportunity to secure a winter cargo now and have them confirm their commitment to a winter cargo delivery. 

		a. Should Cabot commit to a winter cargo we would be in the same position we are today with the exception that they no longer have the ability to cancel the winter cargo on short notice. If we later decline to receive the winter cargo we still pay the $4.7 million in demand charge and surcharge. We would decline to nominate a winter cargo from Cabot only if spot fuel prices are lower than the commodity charge and surcharge.	
					
		b. Should Cabot not commit to a delivery we are relieved of the obligation to pay the $4.7 million in demand charges and surcharges and can buy a spot cargo at an additional savings. The total potential benefit to EcoElectrica of the transaction can be close to $5 million at the current LNG prices (this scenario will be better if prices go down)..

Given where the LNG market is today we should proceed to send the letter to Cabot.

Jaime, Oscar:

Have reviewed the possibility of purchasing a non-Cabot Winter Cargo.  Please review and comment.  The analysis should be looked at in conjunction with the narrative written by Paul included in the attached email.  For detail of analysis, refer to the following Excel icon. 

 


	Items for Consideration and/or Assumptions 	

Cabot's willingness to release the right  not deliver the Winter Cargo (time is of essence in getting Cabot to make this decision in Eco's favor)
Purchase of non-Cabot cargo at 10 cents lower than our 2002 Estimated Commodity Charge and Surcharge Rate. Should consider other scenarios. 	
PRCPI growth of 5.5%, could be updated given the availability of 4-month actual data. 
NYMEX to be continued updating - actual and future. 
Have not considered other incidental expenses related to the transaction.

Ernesto,

Below is a discussion of some of the key contractual issues surrounding the 2002 Winter Cargo. You may also want to review the contract to gain an understanding of how the delivery dates are set for the Last Cargo of 2001, the 2002 Winter Cargo, and the 2002 Early Spring Cargo.

We can discuss this opportunity for Eco in a few days after you have had a chance to familiarize yourself with the issues.

Regards,

Paul

Below are the key points of a conference call held on Friday, May 11, 2001. Attending were Gene Massey of Arent Fox and Coralina Rivera, Dan Masters, and Paul Y'Barbo of Enron. The call was in reference to the LNG supply contract between EcoElectrica and Cabot LNG. Enron LNG got the answers it hoped to get and more.

1. Article 12.3 gives Cabot the right to not deliver a Winter Cargo to Eco if Cabot is unable to complete an Algerian Loading within a window specified in the contract. Cabot could give notice to Eco as late as 3 days prior to the scheduled loading of the Winter Cargo that Cabot will be unable to deliver the cargo. The failure to complete the Algerian Loading must not be the result of a default by Cabot or Distrigas. The failure to achieve an Algerian Loading may not necessarily be the result of an Algerian Force Majeure situation. 

2. Article 12.3 (b) (iv) gives Eco the right to secure replacement fuel for the Winter Cargo. If Eco notices Cabot that Eco has the opportunity to secure replacement fuel, then Cabot has 10 days to notify Eco whether or not they are willing to release the right to not deliver the Winter Cargo. Eco may buy replacement fuel regardless of whether or not Cabot releases the right to not deliver the Winter Cargo. In other words, even if Cabot commits to delivery of a Winter Cargo, Eco is under no obligation to purchase a Winter Cargo from Cabot. 

If Cabot is unable to release its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo, then Eco will buy the replacement fuel and will not have to pay the Demand Charge or Demand Surcharge on the Winter Cargo, a quantity equal to 119,000 cubic meters (~$4.7 MM).

If Cabot releases its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo and Eco still buys the replacement fuel, then Eco will receive no reduction in the annual Demand Charges and Demand Surcharge.

Eco has until December 1st to give notice that it has the opportunity to buy replacement fuel. It was Gene's opinion that the sooner Eco gives notice (today would be good), the less likely Cabot would be willing to give up its right to not deliver the Winter Cargo. Thus, the more likely Eco would be able to get a reduction in Demand Charges and elimination of the Demand Surcharge.

Important Note: The economics of the deal work such that the largest monetary benefit of buying replacement fuel exists when December/January/February U.S. natural gas prices are at their lowest point of the year.

If U.S. natural gas prices were to go down a little further, Eco would want to buy more non-Cabot LNG than just the Winter Cargo replacement.

3. Per Article 7.5, Eco's annual purchase commitment is 66% of the LNG consumed at the Power Facility up to a maximum of 19.46 TBtu (~7 Standard Cargoes). In a year in which the Power Facility consumes 9 Standard Cargoes, Eco would need to "purchase" 6 Standard Cargoes from Cabot. Failure to do so would result in payment of liquidated damages of approximately $0.36/MMBtu.

Important Note: Per Article 7.5, if replacement fuel is purchased rather than buying a Winter Cargo from Cabot, that quantity counts as though it were purchased from Cabot for the purpose of assessing whether or not Eco met its annual purchase commitment. Thus, in a year in which the Power Facility consumes 9 Standard Cargoes, Eco could buy replacement fuel instead of a Cabot Winter Cargo plus 5 Standard Cargoes from Cabot and still meet its annual commitment.

There are benefits to Eco for buying replacement fuel - certainty of supply and a lower price. Enron LNG should continue to pursue a deal with Eco. I plan to schedule a meeting with Mariella Mahan as soon as she is available.

I will provide an update of the economics of this trade in my next e-mail.

Paul

This is the language that has been approved for the notice we would give to Cabot if we decide to notify them about replacing the Winter Cargo:

	Persuant to clause 12.3(b)(iv) of the LNG contract, EcoElectrica
	hereby gives notice to Cabot that it has the opportunity to secure
	replacement fuel for the 2002 Winter Cargo.

	If EcoElectrica does not receive, within the 10-day period allowed, a
	release by Cabot LNG of all rights it has under Section 12.3 not to deliver
	the 2002 Winter Cargo, that cargo shall be deleted from the ACQ and the
	other adjustments made as provided in Section 12.3(iv).

	Pursuant to Article 18, please acknowledge receipt of this notice.

Did the EXCOM group give approval to give the notice?  If so, we need to get together to discuss what to do next.

Dan

The attached spreadsheet allows you to easily calculate Eco's year-end LNG inventory for a variety of cases that vary dispatch rate, # days of outage for CT1, and number of cargoes diverted between now and year-end. Simply enter your assumption for number of days of CT1 outage in cell A16 and the number of cargoes you want to divert in cell A23. The year-end inventory is automatically calculated. A negative number means that you require more LNG than you are entitled to receive.

Assuming that you want the LNG tank full at year-end:

1. Eco will be able to receive 100% of the remaining 6 cargoes if the CT1 outage is 60 days or less

2. 175 days of CT1 outage are required to result in Eco being able to divert 1 cargo and still have a full tank at year-end

3. a 60-175 day outage for CT1 results in surplus LNG but whether or not it is enough to market depends on how much the outage exceeds 60 days

The above figures assume a 76% dispatch and 95% availability on days that Eco is not assumed to be in an outage.

James,

As discussed last Friday I talked with SWPC re fuel specification limits and they provided me with the attached gas fuel specification protocol. Table 1 of the protocol details the allowable fuel requirements. However, In order to protect our warranty SWPC informed me that any deviation from the fuel gas specifications included within the equipment supply contract must be submitted to SWPC and written approval for use be given. With this in mind can I suggest the following.

1. Section 8 of the protocol outlines the deliverables from us in order for SWPC to evaluate the acceptability of the fuel gas with our existing combustor and control arrangement. Specifically for changes to natural gas (as opposed to a synthetic and waste gasses) the deliverables are included in Table 3 attached to the protocol. If you can collate this information from fuel analysis already conducted on the proposed fuel then I can complete the data table and submit to SWPC. Please note the standard conditions which SWPC use to calculate the Specific Gravity as this is significant in calculating the Gas Index (section 2) and subsequently the Gas Index Limits (section 2.1.1).

2. If data is available to allow us to complete some / all of the "Other Tests Non Mandatory" section of Table 3 (especially Hydrogen Sulfide) then please supply this too. 

3. If data is available regarding the contaminants detailed in Table 4 of the protocol then please supply these also. However if these data are not available then this shouldn't cause too much of a problem as there will be no contaminants expected considering the fuel is a natural gas.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Arthur.

Jaime, Oscar:

Have reviewed the possibility of purchasing a non-Cabot Winter Cargo.  Please review and comment.  The analysis should be looked at in conjunction with the narrative written by Paul included in the attached email.  For detail of analysis, refer to the following Excel icon. 

 


	Items for Consideration and/or Assumptions 	

Cabot's willingness to release the right  not deliver the Winter Cargo (time is of essence in getting Cabot to make this decision in Eco's favor)
Purchase of non-Cabot cargo at 10 cents lower than our 2002 Estimated Commodity Charge and Surcharge Rate. Should consider other scenarios. 	
PRCPI growth of 5.5%, could be updated given the availability of 4-month actual data. 
NYMEX to be continued updating - actual and future. 
Have not considered other incidental expenses related to the transaction.





Saludos

Oscar:

We need to look at when it would be most convenient to enter into an LNG purchase transaction given the scenario explained by Paul Y'Barbo below. Please work with Roberto Alvira and prepare a proposal for management.

I am forwarding a separate EMail from Paul with the potential economics of the transaction.

Ernesto,

Below is a discussion of some of the key contractual issues surrounding the 2002 Winter Cargo. You may also want to review the contract to gain an understanding of how the delivery dates are set for the Last Cargo of 2001, the 2002 Winter Cargo, and the 2002 Early Spring Cargo.

We can discuss this opportunity for Eco in a few days after you have had a chance to familiarize yourself with the issues.

Regards,

Paul

Subject:	Eco Winter Cargo

Below are the key points of a conference call held on Friday, May 11, 2001. Attending were Gene Massey of Arent Fox and Coralina Rivera, Dan Masters, and Paul Y'Barbo of Enron. The call was in reference to the LNG supply contract between EcoElectrica and Cabot LNG. Enron LNG got the answers it hoped to get and more.

1. Article 12.3 gives Cabot the right to not deliver a Winter Cargo to Eco if Cabot is unable to complete an Algerian Loading within a window specified in the contract. Cabot could give notice to Eco as late as 3 days prior to the scheduled loading of the Winter Cargo that Cabot will be unable to deliver the cargo. The failure to complete the Algerian Loading must not be the result of a default by Cabot or Distrigas. The failure to achieve an Algerian Loading may not necessarily be the result of an Algerian Force Majeure situation. 

2. Article 12.3 (b) (iv) gives Eco the right to secure replacement fuel for the Winter Cargo. If Eco notices Cabot that Eco has the opportunity to secure replacement fuel, then Cabot has 10 days to notify Eco whether or not they are willing to release the right to not deliver the Winter Cargo. Eco may buy replacement fuel regardless of whether or not Cabot releases the right to not deliver the Winter Cargo. In other words, even if Cabot commits to delivery of a Winter Cargo, Eco is under no obligation to purchase a Winter Cargo from Cabot. 

If Cabot is unable to release its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo, then Eco will buy the replacement fuel and will not have to pay the Demand Charge or Demand Surcharge on the Winter Cargo, a quantity equal to 119,000 cubic meters (~$4.7 MM).

If Cabot releases its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo and Eco still buys the replacement fuel, then Eco will receive no reduction in the annual Demand Charges and Demand Surcharge.

Eco has until December 1st to give notice that it has the opportunity to buy replacement fuel. It was Gene's opinion that the sooner Eco gives notice (today would be good), the less likely Cabot would be willing to give up its right to not deliver the Winter Cargo. Thus, the more likely Eco would be able to get a reduction in Demand Charges and elimination of the Demand Surcharge.

Important Note: The economics of the deal work such that the largest monetary benefit of buying replacement fuel exists when December/January/February U.S. natural gas prices are at their lowest point of the year.

If U.S. natural gas prices were to go down a little further, Eco would want to buy more non-Cabot LNG than just the Winter Cargo replacement.

3. Per Article 7.5, Eco's annual purchase commitment is 66% of the LNG consumed at the Power Facility up to a maximum of 19.46 TBtu (~7 Standard Cargoes). In a year in which the Power Facility consumes 9 Standard Cargoes, Eco would need to "purchase" 6 Standard Cargoes from Cabot. Failure to do so would result in payment of liquidated damages of approximately $0.36/MMBtu.

Important Note: Per Article 7.5, if replacement fuel is purchased rather than buying a Winter Cargo from Cabot, that quantity counts as though it were purchased from Cabot for the purpose of assessing whether or not Eco met its annual purchase commitment. Thus, in a year in which the Power Facility consumes 9 Standard Cargoes, Eco could buy replacement fuel instead of a Cabot Winter Cargo plus 5 Standard Cargoes from Cabot and still meet its annual commitment.

There are benefits to Eco for buying replacement fuel - certainty of supply and a lower price. Enron LNG should continue to pursue a deal with Eco. I plan to schedule a meeting with Mariella Mahan as soon as she is available.

I will provide an update of the economics of this trade in my next e-mail.

Paul

Todd,

The attached calculations are using a Year 2000 PR-CPI of 180.525 (this is 
not obvious because of formatting). The Cabot contract does not specify how 
many decimal places to use. Do we have anything worked out with them 
regarding rounding of the PR-CPI?

When the Hub goes below $3.50 it becomes difficult. At <$3.00 probably no takers.

Oscar,

Per our conversation, the following are the fuel management team's assumptions of fuel requirements for Eco at 100% of capacity:

LNG   91,260 MMBtu/day at 507 MW    Heat Rate = 7500 BTU/kwh

LPG   1905 Metric Tons at 507 MW     Heat Rate = 7461 BTU/kwh    (Note: 522 gallons/MT   ,   91,300 Btu/gallon)

No.2   619,000 gallons/day at 465 MW   Heat Rate = 7313 BTU/kwh    (Note: 131,850 Btu/gallon)


Heat rates at less than 100% of capacity will be different from those at 100%. Check with Rick or Arthur regarding performance curves.

Call me if you have any additional questions.


Regards,

Paul

Note:

It is not too early to be thinking about the possibilty of buying a replacement Winter LNG cargo for the Eco project (see Article 12.3 (b) (iv) of the Cabot contract). My interpretation of the contract is that you avoid the Commodity Charge, Commodity Surcharge, Demand Charge, and Demand Surcharge on one Standard Cargo if Cabot cannot commit to Delivery of the Winter Cargo. For 2002, these add up to over $7.00/MMBtu based on current estimates of how 2001 prices will settle. December/January Nymex prices are ~$5.60/MMBtu. I believe that should mean that Puerto Rico should be able to land a cargo at near $5.00. 

We can discuss the hedges you would need to put in place to secure the benefit of buying the replacement cargo.

Greg,

Attached are some revisions to Jaime's worksheet.

Here are some pertinent facts:

1. Re: Requirement to have 15 days of fuel on-site.   The lowest inventory levels (3 fuels) Eco has seen this year was just before the May LNG cargo. Eco was down to 15.8 days on-site. If Eco had sold 1,000,000 gallons of LPG to ProCaribe in January, then ProCaribe would have decreased its March purchase by 1,000,000 gallons (1 day of Eco consumption) and Eco would have needed to buy 200,000 gallons (0.2 days) on the March cargo. In other words, Eco would have needed to replace only 20% of the LPG it sold. The total cargo size of the March cargo would have been 800,000 gallons less than it was. In May, the fuel on-site would have been exactly 15 days.

2. Mont Belvieu in March was $0.544 and in May it was $0.512. Eco's buyback price in March would have been $0.614 versus its sales price to ProCaribe of $0.70.


Let me know if you have any other questions.


Paul

Based on today's closing NYMEX prices there is $1.9 MM of price difference between EcoElectrica's 2002 Winter Cargo Commodity Charge plus Commodity Surcharge and the delivered cost of 83,000 CBM of LNG. That is $5.61 vs $4.61. This assumes we pay a day rate of $50,000/day for the vessel, Jan '02 NYMEX is $5.41, and the FOB price for LNG is $2.66. 

Let's stay in touch about the possibilty of landing a spot cargo into Puerto Rico in January. As we discussed, how we play this with Cabot is a big issue. There could be an additional $4.7 MM of value that could be captured by Eco if Cabot were unable to release its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo. Also, let's continue to think about how we make the logistics work and how we can get Cabot's cooperation if needed.

Also, note that Eco may need 2 cargoes of this size to make it until the Early Spring Cargo.

Jane-
Per our phone conversation on Friday, we will plan on receiveing the "Methane 
Arctic" with approximately 68,500 M3 about April 2.  This should hold us 
until the last part of April or first part of May.  We will put out the 
official nomination as usual on March 12.

Wayne,

Everything looks good economically and contractually on this (I'll provide an update in another e-mail).

Touchy Area:  Rick Sierra suggests that we get Mariella Mahan's support on this and that we fully disclose the economics to her. Rick says that she will not move unless she fully understands who is making the $$$'s and why they are extracting those amounts. I think that our position is defensible. Who else could provide the replacement fuel at a lower price? Rick feels that she will be reasonable as long as Eco is treated fairly. We always have "Let's do what's best for Enron". 

Shall I initiate a discussion with Mariella?

NEW WORK SOUGHT FOR RIOT-HIT GAS SHIPS

Gas exporters in Indonesia are seeking business for two LNG carriers unexpectedly left without cargoes because of the turmoil in the Indonesian province of Aceh.

LNG industry sources say Osprey Maritime's 129,000 cbm Golar Spirit (built 1981) and Leif Hoegh's 125,000 cbm Hoegh Gandria (built 1977) are sitting idle since  violence caused ExxonMobil to shut its LNG production plant at 
Arun in March.

Sorces indicate the vessels were initially offered at over $90,000 per day, but say rate expectations have now been dropped to nearer $70,000 a day, despite the current shortage of available tonnage.

One report suggests that a US-based importer has fixed one of the ships for a spot cargo from Bontang in Indonesia to Lake Charles, Louisiana, but details on the prospective deal have yet to emerge.

ExxonMobil declared force majeure and shut down its onshore gas fields in Indonesia on 9 March - cutting off supplies to its Arun LNG processing plant - after security incidents and rebel activity in troubled Aceh province escalated.

Indonesian based observers say Pertamina is now keen to see Arun restarted as soon as possible.

However, they add that ExxonMobil is not optimistic about the prospects for putting its employees back in before the end of the year.

Kogas imports around 3-4 million tonnes of LNG amounting to one-fifth of its imports from Arun, and has annual contracts to import two million tonnes of LNG from Malaysia, and 700,000 tonnes from Brunei.

Kogas could be forced to look at taking supplies from the Middle East or other Asian export projects unless the Acehnese tensions are eased.

New suppliers like Yemen are emerging while existing exporters such as Malaysia, Australia, and the Middle East are expanding their capacity, creating fierce competition.

Rick,

Some additional factors have come to light since our Wednesday decision to not divert the Hoegh Galleon to Eco at the end of July. I believe that these factors warrant continued consideration of the diversion.

1. A Cabot LNG cargo was nominated with a delivery window of August 18-22. The cargo can be cancelled with no penalty "up to 10 days prior to the middle day of its Delivery Window". Cabot should be notified as soon as possible if Eco chooses to cancel.

2. The delivery window of the Cabot cargo might be past the time that the FERC representatives planned to be in Puerto Rico. Victor Vega is checking with his contacts at the FERC to find out whether or not they will still be in Puerto Rico during the time the cargo will be unloaded.

3. Eco's upside is really greater than previously discussed. Let's say that Eco purchased the Hoegh Galleon cargo for $3.38/MMBtu. All of this LNG should be considered "excess LNG" for the year 2001. Eco could make a deal with PREPA that resulted in an 85-90% dispatch and PREPA could get a great "spot fuel price". Each $0.10/MMBtu that Eco is able to get from PREPA for dispatch above 76% means $200,000 of profit to Eco. A SPF of $3.98/MMBtu would be a $0.60/MMBtu margin on 2 TBtu or $1.2 MM.

Let's discuss.

Paul
