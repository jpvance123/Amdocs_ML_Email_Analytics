In addition I think that Jennifer Shipos ( originally slated for Tx marketing) will be better suited to return to the Derivatives group.  That being the case, Tom, Barry, Brian and I agree that we should extend an offer to Morris Larubbio.  If Gary and Morris accept, that will complete the 2 marketing slots for Texas.

Louise, with mark smith out, I'd like approval to go to plan B which would be to extend an offer to Gary Brian. How do we go about doing this? 

This move is supported by Tom Martin, Vickers, and Tycholiz. By cc to Chis - any objections?

Mitch said he is definitely done if we get him VP, 140Base, 125/125.  He will call in the morning to see if we can do that.  I recommend we bite the bullet given our lack of marketer success to date.

I need to compare my spreadsheets with our database to ensure we have similar info. If I find any discrepancies, I will let you know on Monday.

FYI.

I've asked for more accurate analysis of what differences are and may need your help to get an agreement to either increase bases for those say below $100k base or give everyone an "allowance" as part of the initial first 12 month transition.

We have this issue in every deal we do, the benefit coverage is good
overall, but employees pay more for the coverage. It's income based which
mitigates impact to lower paid and we find higher paid focus on total comp
and not benefits.  Benefits are the one thing we keep the same for all of
Citigroup and we don't want to do anything with subsidy or anything else.
Happy to discuss futher how we market overall comp. and ben. philosphy to
deal with the benefits.

John,

I am worried about comparison between your and our benefits costs. Perhaps
you could review and let me know if you agree we have a problem. My
recommendation is that we consider a subsidy or payrise for our people who
may otherwise suffer a hardship in meeting the additional costs of your
medical/dental premiums.

Louise,

I have a bit of an issue with this because the power and gas objectives seem to take a backseat to the EOL objectives.  For example, bradford said he will not get to my request for my top power counterparties for a couple of weeks because he has a top-50 eol list that he is working on.  There are a lot of counterparties that are important that do not necessarily use EOL.   EOL is an amazing platform, but I dont think EOL should be driving the power, gas, legal and credit rampup processes.

Hello Louise,Dave,David,

Is there any reason why we should not get started with the process of 
getting business cards and Amex cards for all folks that have signed 
up to join the new entity?

In order for Wes's team to handle the curve validation and reporting responsibilities under the UBSW preferred delineation of responsibilities between Op's and Accounting/Finance, he estimates a need for 3 people. As I understand it, while in Enron terms these activities were previously handled in Sally's area, a transfer of 3 people from her team is not possible, primarily as a consequence of  them not having bought anyone across in Gossetts team to handle physical business. Apparently these people were cut in the last round of headcount reductions pre-offers.

Bottom-line, Wes needs to go ahead and get 3 people on board quickly so would you confirm how you want to proceed:

1. Are you ok with incremental headcount or does the Energy Op's or another headcount budget reduce by 3 to balance the books and keep overall at 650.
2. Can I go ahead and put a contract offer in front of Kevin Sweeney?
3. Can we produce a standard offer for 2 other people including a sign-on representative of what they might have received in Bonus (these are 2 snr spec level so this would be in the teens).

Louise -

I spoke with Dave last night and he would like to propose the following changes.

Stephanie Sever		from $6,500	to $7,000	
Christopher Walker	from $2,000	to $4,000	(Jennifer Denny highly recommends, contributions not reflected in mid-year rating)
Fraisy George		from $2,479	to $3,000	(used to be in call center, nature of job changed and has increased responsibility from mid-year)
Adam Johnson 		from $2,000	to $6,000	(Jennifer Denny highly recommends, would take him over anyone else at his level, feels should be compensated for 							his contributions)

Please let me know your thoughts.

Amy

In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be "Double Deducted" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence. 

    

Thanks, Tony Jarrett

The following e-mail is to confirm my understanding of the following verbal assurances provided to me as part of the intent and conditions for signing a contingent employment agreement/retention package related to the sale of the Enron gas and power trading business ("Enron trading business") to a new entity.

If a new entity purchases the Enron trading business and the contingent employment agreement executed on January 5, 2002 becomes a valid and binding agreement, Enron's management will not initiate a lawsuit to recover the 2001 performance bonus payments.
Enron and/or purchaser of the Enron trading business will seek approval from the bankruptcy judge of the 2001 performance bonus payments to eliminate any future uncertainty with respect to the validity of those payments.
To the extent the total retention $'s available for the Enron trading business employees is increased above current levels (from the leading bidder as of January 5, 2002), the intent of Enron's senior management is to make an upward adjustment to the individual employees who have committed to the new entity such that the employee maintains a substantially similar percentage of the total "pool" of retention $'s.

we have asked our benfits folks to work on better comparisons, however, we
don't like to make exceptions on benefits, we have people across the street
in Houston etc, like to keep benefits the same across Citigroup and have pay
(cash and equity) be the delta between business groups.

John,

The more I look at these comparisons, the more I'm convinced we have to
agree an interim subsidy to let folks down gently and/or a salary
adjustment. I think we will lose a very high number of people from this
transaction if we don't make some accommodation here.

I'll call you later today to discuss.

I also need to touch base with you on your salary comment. I need to clarify
what you mean by salary freeze. I understood you were ok with us promoting a
few people (50 or so) in next 4/6 weeks (so long as we run list passed you
first) and in this regard I would expect to adjust their salaries. We have
traditionally raised commercial support salaries (below VP) in line with
COLA (based on performance but typically around 3-4.5% of payroll) each
January and there certainly will be some expectations we will have to deal
with.

Regards

David

Attached below is an Excel Workbook containing benefits projections for
2002.  The first tab contains Enron Rates including Flex Dollars, the 2nd
tab is Citigroup Rates conservative estimate, and the 3rd tab is Citigroup
Rates maxing out the Life and AD&D rates. After averaging out the Citigroup
rates, out of pocket costs for Netco employee's will range anywhere from 4
to 5% because flexdollars are not provided.  If you have any questions about
the grids give me a call.

I sent him back a reply saying, as a minimum, if we see "hardship" for the
less than $100k base people, we will want to raise their salaries 3-5%.

We have this issue in every deal we do, the benefit coverage is good
overall, but employees pay more for the coverage. It's income based which
mitigates impact to lower paid and we find higher paid focus on total comp
and not benefits.  Benefits are the one thing we keep the same for all of
Citigroup and we don't want to do anything with subsidy or anything else.
Happy to discuss futher how we market overall comp. and ben. philosphy to
deal with the benefits.

John,

I am worried about comparison between your and our benefits costs. Perhaps
you could review and let me know if you agree we have a problem. My
recommendation is that we consider a subsidy or payrise for our people who
may otherwise suffer a hardship in meeting the additional costs of your
medical/dental premiums.

Out two San Fran employees would like to work out of the UBS Warburg office there.  I believe it is 555 California St.  Is there someone at UBS I should contact?

Just discussed this with Collette and UBS HR. Suggestion is we proceed as follows:

Any suggested change must be agreed by one of you on the Enron side (including support)
If you agree, we will capture the proposed changes on the attached form and fax it to UBS team.
If the change is simply a reallocation of dollars, as anticipated within the pool, they will generate a new contract.
If the change is incremental to the pool, or otherwise significant, Collette has arranged a time on Sat, Sun and Mon to call Hutch. If he agrees she will authorise the UBS team to produce the amended form.
I anticipate suggested changes to the document text and titles. These we will also capture on above form and fax to UBS for discussion.

Looks like I need to run this passed Colette Dow to make sure they are ok. Can you help me with who you would consider the subs for the names below who are now out from the c list:

	  Alonso, Thomas     	 
	  Arora, Harry   (replacement Greg Woulfe)
>       Aucoin, Berney  (potential replacement Jim Brysch) 
>       Badeer, Robert
>       Choi, Paul
>       Conch, Charles
>       Coulter, Edwin
	  Fischer, Mark 
>       Gupta, Gautam
>       Herndon, Rogers
>       Keavey, Peter
>       Luce, Laura
>       McKay, Brad
>       Motley, Matt
>       O'Neil, Murray  (replacement Scotty Gilbert)
>       Patrick, Micheal (on list in error should be Sherman) 
>       Roberts, Mike   (replacement Dave Ryan)
>       Robinson, Mitch
>       Rosman, Stewart
>       Ruscitti, Kevin
>       Schweiger, James
>       Suarez, John
>       Whitt, Mark

If Lagrasta and Llodra sign a doc of some nature we will be at 81 against a target of 84. 

If we have agreement to switch out about 5 names from above list we are over condition precedent. I talked with Greg who believes this is not an issue, but I just as soon have that in writing.

     My understanding is "c"s can only be swaped with UBS approval.  I 
     would send a note to Colette requesting approval for any names change 
     in the front office.
     
     Thanks

Please let me know your understanding of the deal conditions surrounding the 
"c"list. My current estimate is we may just get the required 84 names from the 
 original list, however, it seems many people from my side have the 
understanding tha t:
     
*       Where someone on the c list said no, we could substitute names. If this 
is the case we have passed the threshold easily.
*       That while my piece of paper says 80% the intent was 70%. Again we 
wouldbe done today.
*       Some of the names are "mistakes" which were never intended to be on 
list(this probably accounts for 4 names at least).
     
Obviously, I am keen to report to all that we have achieved the appropriate 
signup percentages and that this deal condition is done.
     
David

Lavo said he is not keeping track of these dollars.  Greg said I should communicate to the two of you what I have done.

Employee:		Old Sign-On		New Sign-On
George Wood		70K			80K
Andrea Woodland	15K			25K
Chris Lackey		30K			35K
Jeff Shields*		30K			35K
Laura Wente*		35K			35K
		Total:	!80K			210K

*Part of original $11MM pool, but new offer (instead of Choi and Rosman)

Employee headcount is kept flat (Shields and Wente for Choi/Rosman)
Sign-on Dollars is kept flat ($30K spent vs $60K saved on declines by Mark Smith and Troy Black (60K each))

Following our discussion this morning we discussed and agreed in principle, the following changes to the "standard" contract form with UBS:

1 - Involuntary Termination
Change for all contract to 90 days. Wording 99% agreed.

2 - UBS "free" option beyond March 15
Change to March 22 and make mutual. Wording 95% agreed.

3 - Non-compete to exclude Enron retrospective reference
Re-wording of this clause to focus on NETCo and ENA rather than Enron. Wording 50% agreed.

4 - Miscellaneous clause
Change to clause that says ee reps they know of no claims, grievances, to be changed to "against individual". 100% agreed.

5 - Recognition of prior Enron service wording
Added to contracts. Wording lifted from offer letter. 100% agreed.

While we have agreed to above, please bear in mind:

- Contracts will now be delayed until wording is finally signed off by lawyers (eta 3 hours)
- We have to draw the line on further changes en mass now or we won't get anything done.
- We have not "agreed" salary and promotions completely. UBS are concerned about percentages of a few. I think we will have resolution this evening.
- I am not expecting new docs until late this evening.

Audrey is ok with the following plan.  Please let me know if you are too...

Breakfast (donuts, muffins, kolaches, coffee) on both floors to welcome everyone in the morning.

Happy Hour celebration with the group.

  
I have looked into:
Sambuca Jazz Cafe http://sambucahouston.citysearch.com/  We can have the place to ourselves from 3-5 and we could move the party to the 2nd floor after 5:00.  Audrey would prefer that we keep it to a two drink minimum.  They can have drink tickets available upon arrival.  We can have a selection of appetizers available and we could also arrange to pay for valet parking.  With a high estimate of 600 people here are the following cost estimates:

Food, Beverage, Valet*, Tax, and Gratuity - $29.22 per person
Same as above minus valet* - $27.22 per person

*Valet was only for an estimate of 200 cars

I'm ready to roll with the arrangements, and told Audrey I would keep her in the loop regarding arrangements.  

Let me know!

Regards,
Julie

We would like to have a biref status meeting at 9am in John Lavorato's old office/Greg Whalley's new office, at 9am Monday morning.
 
The main agenda item is to review where we are relative to last weeks distribution of offer letters and for certain key people employment agreements. As of Friday there remained a large number of contracts especially, unaccounted for (although the recipients alledgedly have verbally accepted the terms).

Do you think we should arrange events for the remote offices as well?

Louise, 

We have been trying to get something arranged for this Friday.  UBS has special events personnel that arrange these types of events including what we saw at the Houstonian a few weeks ago.  It is my understanding that we are awaiting approval from Mike Hutchins before making any arrangements.  Informally, I have spoken with Jillian's and Sambuca regarding availability for a Friday afternoon event.  However, absent using yours or Greg's credit card, we will need approval through UBS prior to booking any formal event.

Kind regards,
Julie

I had planned to be going to London for a long weekend between Feb 7 and 12th for some family gatherings. Absent any last minute emergencies, I am planning to make the trip. I will be reachable by cell phone and probably email sporadically.

Whitt is fine at 150k and 150k @if Lucci is at 50k and 50k @if we offer employment to Theresa Staab who is a scheduler.

Also all of us may be going to NY on Thursday morning.

Issue is headcount approval. In the next 6 months I'm not sure we can commit to any increase, although if we get a flying start in Canada it is possible. While I think we can explore whether UBS are interested elsewhere, my feeling is that we can't commit to anything at this stage. If things are different in July them maybe we can reconsider if they haven't found something elsewhere.

Subject:	ECC New Grads

David, we made offers to 4 new grads a few months ago to work for Enron Canada Corp. ECC is obviously going to renege on these offers. Is there any opportunity to have these offers assigned to UBS Warburg Energy. All four of these new grads are outstanding and the timing should be aligned with business ramping up (ie June - Sept timeframe). The estate would be cooperative with assigning the offers and the students are looking for clarity/comfort.

Redmond - Approved to go to 175/175 but only after Louise/Lavo speak with him.
Frihart - Approved in principle but preference is for Calger/Vickers to leave $85k s/o in and reduce $105/$105 to $50/$50.
Brysch - increase to 75/75 approved.
Lambie - is a probable no, not a verbal yes.
Oh - Approved at 75/75
Biever - Approved at 20/20
Drozdiak - approved at 20/20
Steffes - Whalley to call. Is at 100/100, for some reason Steffes thought it was 200/200!
Port - should be withdrawn
Gorny - draft as replacement to Port 50/50 contract (I need to approved with Stockman)
Hayden - draft contract at 50/50 as above.
Sweeney - Has declined in principle therefore do not proceed.

Louise,

Seung-Taek Oh will be working for me as the head of real-time markets in Ercot. As a two year associate he would have been eligible for promotion to manager. He was also an UBS employee and as such was an associate director. I would like to change his title from undefined to associate director.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Doug

Mitch said he is definitely done if we get him VP, 140Base, 125/125.  He will call in the morning to see if we can do that.  I recommend we bite the bullet given our lack of marketer success to date.

Earlier today Mark Breese resigned to accept another position.  Mark had been slated to go to NetCo in Structuring to work for Berney Aucoin.  Several weeks ago Eric Moon also resigned.  He too was slated for NetCo Structuring.  At this point Berney is the only remaining individual in NetCo Structuring.  I suggest that we identify individuals that might be considered for replacements.  These individuals are likely to currently be in EstateCo. As EstateCo has not yet announced any retention program I am concerned that possible replacements may elect to leave EstateCo before we have a chance to discuss NetCo positions.  I would like to work with Berney and the Origination team to identify appropriate replacements and move to notify them of this opportunity.

Just spoke with Colette, she confirmed that the list Lance sent us was in fact inaccurate. In fact we had a target of 74 in the C category (or 70%). As such Colette agreed we were done.

Excellent.

Overall Stats

650	Headcount Budget
688	Updated offers made (includes 9 new offers requested yesterday and today)
584	Acceptances as of now.
52	Outstanding
42	Declines (Mainly commercial plus Weather)

Deal contingency update:

B List
12 of 12		Target was 80% or 10.

C List
79 of 105 (this includes 5 or 6 people who are waiting final docs but are done verbally but not Llodra or Lagrasta who are still "open")
Target was 84.

I have meeting with Colette Dow to discuss C list and make sure she is OK with some of the names we have switched out. Presuming she agrees we will be done on this condition.

B list

11 of 12 signed (Milnthorp verbal acceptance)

C list

68 of 105 signed (13 verbal acceptances subject to docs - puts us at 81). Target is 84.

You mentioned this morning we can swap out names in this group. If so here are names that are definite no's from C list:

Aucoin, Berney	(potential replacement Jim Brysch)
Badeer, Robert
Choi, Paul
Conch, Charles
Coulter, Edwin
Gupta, Gautam
Herndon, Rogers
Keavey, Peter
Luce, Laura
McKay, Brad
Motley, Matt
O'Neil, Murray	(replacement Scotty Gilbert)
Patrick, Micheal (on list in error should be Sherman)
Roberts, Mike
Robinson, Mitch
Rosman, Stewart
Ruscitti, Kevin
Schweiger, James
Suarez, John
Whitt, Mark

Looks like we will NOT meet percentage on original names, so you may want to have the swapping out discussion with Mike Hutchins.

Just a quick FYI;

If we end up doing deal with Umbrella, our review of their benefits package seems to indicate it will cost many of employees significantly more for the same level of medical and dental coverage, as much as $5000 pa.

I plan to raise this with John Donnelly and see if we can negotiate a softer landing for people, but I wanted you to know that this will cause quite a stir if we proceed without any pay rises or special subsidy for the rank and file.

Louise, 

We have been trying to get something arranged for this Friday.  UBS has special events personnel that arrange these types of events including what we saw at the Houstonian a few weeks ago.  It is my understanding that we are awaiting approval from Mike Hutchins before making any arrangements.  Informally, I have spoken with Jillian's and Sambuca regarding availability for a Friday afternoon event.  However, absent using yours or Greg's credit card, we will need approval through UBS prior to booking any formal event.

Kind regards,
Julie

I want to make sure that we are adopting a policy whereby any material changes to employment agreements for individual employees are adopted across the board so we are creating consistency for all employees with respect to contract terms and conditions.
 
I think this is very important from an execution and timing standpoint.   I want to be able to represent to employees that "lawyering" the docs to death is not necessary, because we are going to maintain consistency for all employees.
 
I would like an affirmative yes on this question by Tuesday am.
 
Does everyone agree?

My current understanding is an anticipated close of February 8th (Friday). 

There are a number of matters we will need to communicate to employees between now and then. While we may decide that consolidating these matters into a single communication is not practical/desirable, I would like to make sure that all employee communications are co-ordinated. Below is an initial list of the general matters that we have currently identified as needing to be addressed with my understanding of who is taking the lead:


HR Matters					Audrey Martin/David Oxley/Robert Jones/Neil Davies
Deadlines for o/s offers
Payroll switch over
First few checks to home address
Benefits coverage/elections
Orientations
Enron departure letter/process
Return of Enron proprietary documents/info

Buildings Access/Security Badges		Rocco Velpri/Bill Donovan/Cindy Olson/Wes Colwell
New badge arrangements
Access to Enron premises
Use of Gym, Doctors office, Restaurant, kids centre
Access for Enron ee's to NETCo floors
Ongoing Car parking, Bus passes et al

Cell phones/Blackberrys/Pagers		Wes Colwell/Jenny Rub/?
Transfer arrangements
Return of equipment

Email addresses/Network Access/et al		Jenny Rub/?
New logons/passwords
Old files return to Enron

Stationary and General Admin		Wes Colwell/Tammy Shepherd
Business Cards
Letterhead, et al
Ordering of office supplies
Return of Enron supplies

Business Expenses				Audrey Martin/David Oxley/Wes Colwell
Process going forward
Training/procedures/payment schedule
Reimb. of outstanding Enron expenses

All Employee Communications		Mark Palmer/ David Walker
On launch celebration/bon voyage
Subsequent update/mediums

Please let me have your comments/recommendations on above. Given the NETCo employee list is not yet finalised, I will be the point of contact to confirm correct headcount and names.

David

In a strategic move to provide relative probability to moving enovate (JV with Peoples Energy) to UBS, I believe it is critical to show Peoples our support of the office in Chicago.  The potential of this outcome increases two fold, by ensuring Gregg Penman and Richard Tomaski are employees of UBS.  Neither received an offer due to decisions made outside my control.  We have now given odds that enovate will move into Newco or be sold to a third party.  I believe this outcome is disheartening to all of us involved.  It was my goal to salvage as much of the PEC relationship as possible and meetings held in Chicago this week were essential as a first step.  I have continued to believe in this business model whether with Peoples or elsewhere and I belive strongly that Gregg and Richard are essential staff.  They "know" how to run it and none of our competitors have suceeded in this business.. 
 
My team believed in a business model and followed through in relocating their families, setting up a business with a "real" customer (that Enron all to often discounted) and created something that a significant list of third parties want to buy (BP Amoco, Oxy, Sempra, PanCanadian, El Paso, Sempra, CMS, Duke, and Dynegy).  This relationship has created over $130MM dollars of MTM for Enron without consideration of the information trading obtained.  This was not a transaction, but a business.  
 
My recommendation for Gregg and Richard is to immediately provide an offer that requires a non-compete of 1 year with consideration of $60,000 at 6 months and $60,000 at one year, with the promise of stock in year 2.  
 
We do not want these guys at a competitor or with Newco.  No one else in the industry has the ability to run as quickly as we will if we have this team together.  You can hold me to that.  
 
I can be reached at home at 713/528-9854.
 
Laura

Base is same
Upfront payment is same
$55cash/$55 equity

I have had discussions with Bryant.  He was disappointed as to the reduction in the equity because as he says "he is in this for the long run". However, I can get him done at current structure if move 50/50 to 55/55.  Is that possible ? That adds a total of $10 k over a 2 year period with 50% cash ($5000) in the first year and 50% equity ($5000) in the back.  Seems like it should not be a deal breaker.

Louise, 

We have been trying to get something arranged for this Friday.  UBS has special events personnel that arrange these types of events including what we saw at the Houstonian a few weeks ago.  It is my understanding that we are awaiting approval from Mike Hutchins before making any arrangements.  Informally, I have spoken with Jillian's and Sambuca regarding availability for a Friday afternoon event.  However, absent using yours or Greg's credit card, we will need approval through UBS prior to booking any formal event.

Kind regards,
Julie

John,

As discussed, we propose a 3% adjustment to the base salaries of the under $100k employees to be included in the NETCo offer letters we may produce next week (this is separate from any promotions we may want to make - we will give you a list by Friday pm). I have spoken with John and Louise and they are in agreement. Following our last conversation I believed you also were in agreement. Please confirm.

The salary increase will NOT be communicated as a subsidy for additional benefits costs, but as a modified/streamlined annual base salary review which we would do at this time of year, in the normal course of business.

David

Subject:	Final Cost Estimates For SSMB Benefit Transition

Attached below is the final Estimates for SSMB:

Based on a worst case scenario if all AD&D, Employee Life and Spouse Life insurances were maxed out it will take $1.9 million additional dollars to make every employee whole (3% over our current annual payroll).

If we only look at employee's who make less than $100 K a year we would need $1.2 million additional dollars. (worst case scenario)

Included are all the estimates, rate charts, and salary adjustments.

 

Thanks, Tony

I worlked with Jeff Gosset, Stacey White and Bob Hall today on their input for proposed promotions for Operations.  Tana Cashion has the recommended names and salary increases.  Do you need anything else?  Description of their respoinsibilities, rationale for promotion recommendation, etc.?  Let me know.  

I mentioned to Tana that letters had been given to both Jeff Gossett and Bob Superty in late November or December stating that they would be promoted from Director to Senior Director at the first of the year.  We have Jeff covered, but with the change in Bob Superty's reporting relationship, I want to be certain that his promotion doesn't fall through the cracks.  Tana was somehow unaware of these letters, although they were prepared by HR.  As you review the entire list of proposed promotions, please be check to make sure that Bob Superty's name was submitted by Scott Neal for a promotion.  

Thanks.  --Sally

John,

The more I look at these comparisons, the more I'm convinced we have to agree an interim subsidy to let folks down gently and/or a salary adjustment. I think we will lose a very high number of people from this transaction if we don't make some accommodation here.

I'll call you later today to discuss.

I also need to touch base with you on your salary comment. I need to clarify what you mean by salary freeze. I understood you were ok with us promoting a few people (50 or so) in next 4/6 weeks (so long as we run list passed you first) and in this regard I would expect to adjust their salaries. We have traditionally raised commercial support salaries (below VP) in line with COLA (based on performance but typically around 3-4.5% of payroll) each January and there certainly will be some expectations we will have to deal with.

Regards

David

Attached below is an Excel Workbook containing benefits projections for 2002.  The first tab contains Enron Rates including Flex Dollars, the 2nd tab is Citigroup Rates conservative estimate, and the 3rd tab is Citigroup Rates maxing out the Life and AD&D rates. After averaging out the Citigroup rates, out of pocket costs for Netco employee's will range anywhere from 4 to 5% because flexdollars are not provided.  If you have any questions about the grids give me a call.

We have this issue in every deal we do, the benefit coverage is good
overall, but employees pay more for the coverage. It's income based which
mitigates impact to lower paid and we find higher paid focus on total comp
and not benefits.  Benefits are the one thing we keep the same for all of
Citigroup and we don't want to do anything with subsidy or anything else.
Happy to discuss futher how we market overall comp. and ben. philosphy to

John,

I am worried about comparison between your and our benefits costs. Perhaps
you could review and let me know if you agree we have a problem. My
recommendation is that we consider a subsidy or payrise for our people who
may otherwise suffer a hardship in meeting the additional costs of your
medical/dental premiums.

Great!  That sounds logical and much more simple than preparing entirely new agreements.  I hadn't seen a template, but would be happy to assist by either preparing or reviewing one.  Let me know if I can provide any assistance.  Michelle

     Michelle:

     I think what was discussed is simply a cover letter to annex to the
     contracts indicating the name of the new entity. Lou/Audrey-didn't we
     prepare a template for this ?

Do you have any information on new contracts for Canada?

Thanks.

        The name for the Canadian entity which will enter into both Master Agree
ments and individual commodity transactions is: "UBS Warburg Energy (Canada) Ltd
.", as confirmed by Lou Eber: UBS Chief Legal Counsel.

        I am working on chasing down the parental guarantee issue.

It's my turn, I've asked for nothing 

I need Caroline Abramo 

As well as her bonus we need 

100k and 100k contract. 

A promotion to VP. 

And she wants to report Calger and Milnthorp. 

Hunter and I think it is very important.

Lets discuss again after we have nailed whether there are any large differences in medical insurance costs. Bottom-line, we won't people to sign new offer letters without too much pain or accusations that the terms are not "comparable". I share your sentiment about lower salaried employees, mainly.

I'll call you Monday.

David

We have a salary freeze in place over 75 k, people will have to get used to
some short term changes for better long term opportunity.
