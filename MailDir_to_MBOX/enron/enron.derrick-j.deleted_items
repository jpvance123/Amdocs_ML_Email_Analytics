Please consider the following retired judges from Chicago.  I don't know any
of them personally and there is a good chance that neither does Paul Weiss:
Abner Mikva, Seymour Simon, Frank McGarr.  They come highly recommended by
my friend Marv Aspen, the Ch. Judge of the ND Ill.

I understand that due to Enron's problems in America and the fact that that Arthur Andersen are getting involved in a dispute over various audit matters as a result of the bankruptcy there may be difficulties in having Andersen audit ENS for year 2001. While I can see that there may be reservations in accepting the re-appointment of Andersen for ENS I feel that we should consider the implications of finding another auditor at this late stage.

Andersen in Warsaw are well aware of the problems ENS is facing at the present time with regard to power and gas pricing; they are aware of the problems associated with the Settlement Agreement and it's accounting treatment to date. They are familiar with our systems and people. We have also negotiated a significant reduction in fees compared with last year.

New auditors would have to be taken through all the issues from scratch. This would consume time not only from the accounting department but throughout the Company. The audit would take longer and, at this stage, I'm not sure when any new auditors would be able to start given that January is their busiest period. Andersen are available with immediate effect since I have constantly been impressing on them that, given the complexity of ENS problems, we should allow ourselves the maximum amount of time to consider what to put into the report should some problems persist longer than envisaged.

I feel that a change in auditors at this moment in time would be not be in our best interests in view of the above. Also if the ownership of ENS is to be changed it would be beneficial to have audited accounts in double quick time since potential investors will undoubtedly be looking for such statements.

Jeff McMahon has proposed that Ben Glisan is the most appropriate person to provide brief summaries to the BoD on Chewco, Whitewing and Marlin, if Ken would like these topics presented to the BoD.  Both Jeff and Ben will be standing by for today's meeting in case they are needed.  Joe Dilg will attend the full meeting, most likely via teleconference.  

Following is a revised note to Ken.  Thanks.

The Crescendo project is a Northern Border project, and the appropriate contact for Christopher Sullivan (the fellow that left Jim the voice mail) is probably Janet Place.  I've left Janet a voice mail with the contact information on Sullivan and asked her to get ahold of him regarding his letter on the helium issue.  In case you access email ahead of voice mail Janet, the guy is Chistopher Sullivan, Rocky Mountain Helium, 1-800-945-1547.  Thanks all.  DF

Frank, Steve, Charlie, Robin, Greg and Maria:  CONGRATULATIONS on an outstanding result!  I don't think I've ever in my days as an outhouse and inhouse lawyer worked with a team that was so cohesive and effective.  That you guys did it with a group pulled together  from two firms as well as in house lawyers is doubly impressive.  We appreciate the long hours and sacrifices you all made to get  this thing ready and try it in such a short time period.  Your timing is impeccable, as having a little good news about Enron out in the marketplace is sorely needed right now!  Thanks again guys!  DF

Dear Sir:

My understanding is that Mr. Rick Bergsieker and you are the only directors
of Enron Middle East, Ltd., and that Mr. Darrin Donegan is the current local
manager of this company.  I also understand that Mr. Bergsieker is not with
Enron any more, Enron Middle East is still solvent, and it has very limited
indebtedness, other than my outstanding expense claims.

PLEASE READ ON.

I was an employee of Enron from 9 September 1999 to 5 December 2001 and from
1 February 2001 to the end, my Enron employer was Enron Middle East.  During
this time, I incurred business related expenses with the prior knowledge and
approval of my supervisors totaling US$90,000.  I have duly filed and had
approved these expense claims, but unfortunately have not received the
reimbursement yet.  Mr. Clay Harris was my last boss and he is still with
Enron (clay.harris@enron.com, EGM LNG team, London).  Ms. Kim Hickok
(kim.hickok@enron.com) is the current EGM HR person and has the full
documentation relating to the claim.

PLEASE READ ON.

Albeit very limited, Enron Middle East does have some assets.  I plead with
you to instruct Mr. Donegan to sell Enron Middle East's assets reimburse my
pre-agreed, appropriately lodged, and duly approved expense claims, whose
non-payment has been ruinous for my family.

I thank you for your help at these difficult times.

Dear Senator Leahy:

        I am Chairman of the Committee of Corporate General Counsel, which
is part of the Business Law Section of the American Bar Association. Our
membership is comprised of the senior-most legal officers of many of
America's largest companies.

        Our members have asked me to write to you, in your capacity as
Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to express our views concerning
the importance of the Federal Judiciary.

        The tragic events of September 11 underscore for all of us the
freedoms that we enjoy in our country. We know that you and your fellow
Senators on the Judiciary Committee are devoted to helping protect these
precious freedoms. We also know that you and your fellow Senators recognize
the critical importance of our system of justice in preserving and
protecting these freedoms.

        We write to express our thanks to you and your colleagues for your
efforts in reviewing the qualifications of individuals nominated for
Federal
District Court and Circuit Court positions. Recognizing the need for a
fully-staffed Federal Judiciary, we also appreciate all your efforts in
determining the qualifications of nominees for the Judiciary as
expeditiously as possible.

         If our organization, or any of our members, may ever be of
assistance in any way, I hope you will call upon us. Thank you.

Jim/Rob -

Given the number of litigation issues, the Linklaters Dabhol team needs another senior lawyer to help lead various efforts (which I have advocated).  Christopher Walker has recommended that Greg Reid of Linklaters join the team.  I believe that Greg is currently head of Linklaters International Arbitration group.

I've spoken with Barry Hunsaker and Stephen Wallace regarding Greg.  Both had very favorable things to say about Greg:  Hard-working, detail-oriented, smart, etc.  Neither of them had any reservations about Greg although he apparently does have a sharp sense of humor (so I can see why he and Chris get along).

Greg would not handle the "India side" of the litigation efforts which would remain with Chris.  He would help with the "London side" and the lender enforcement side (to the extent that occurs outside India).  In any event, Chris would remain as the leader of the overall litigation effort and we will expect Chris to keep tabs on matters Greg is handling to ensure the overall coordination of the effort.

Let me know if you have any comments or objections to Greg's involvement.

Bruce

Subject:	Dahbol


Dear Mr Lundstrom,

from discussions with my partner, Sandeep Katwala, I understand that as the
number of issues and proceedings arising out of the Dahbol project continue
to proliferate we need to increase the partner resources devoted to the
matter.

I attach a short cv giving my professional and academic background. I have
been at Linklaters for 16 years doing litigation and arbitration . For the
last 2 years I have been co-ordinating L&A's European arbitration practice,
but have, in the past, worked closely with Chris Walker. I have also had
considerable exposure to power projects, both domestic and international
(including an involvement in the Appeal to the Supreme Court in Pakistan on
the Hub project).

Last year I successfully completed a significant arbitration for EOG. Please
feel free to call Barry Hunsaker at EOG if you would like more background on
that job. I am presently acting on a much smaller matter for Enron (taking
instructions from Stephen Wallace) that comes to hearing in London on 8/9
November.

I am presently based in Paris, but spend about one third of my time in our
London office. This is increasing and, as a result, I will be moving back to
London in July/August of next year. If you have any questions regarding my
suitability to join the team on the Dahbol project please do not hesitate to
call me direct.

yours sincerely

If our negotiating team can get the Prime Minister to change his name from Behari Vajpayee to Vajpayor, our problems will be solved...

Mark - Below are the details on the status of our remaining open inquiries.
We could use your help mostly as follows:

1.  Ensuring that we get responses back from Enron Methanol (Drew Fossum)
and PGE/Enron Communications (Barbara Halle).  We have been in touch with
them, but they are still researching our requests.

2.  Getting information needed for the transfer of control applications for
the delinquent companies (PGE, EOTT, Louisiana Gas, Midwestern Gas and
Magnolia Construction).  We will need details on all of the transactions and
will need to figure out who will sign the applications. 

3.  Getting contact information for the companies listed in III., below, for
which we still have no information.

We will call you in the morning to discuss.  Thanks for your help.  Aileen.

TEXAS TRIBUTE ONLINE
News from The University of Texas at Austin
____________________________________________
Dear Texas Tribute reader:
This is the first issue of TEXAS TRIBUTE ONLINE, a monthly e-newsletter offering brief items of interest from the UT Austin campus. Some items will include a link you can click on for a complete story while others will stand alone.
You are receiving TEXAS TRIBUTE ONLINE because of your interest in and support of UT. Like the printed version of Texas Tribute, the online edition's primary goal is to highlight the enormous impact of philanthropy at the University, and other interesting items will occasionally be part of the mix.
We hope you enjoy TEXAS TRIBUTE ONLINE, but if you do not wish to receive future issues, simply reply to this message and type REMOVE in the subject field to be removed from our distribution list. Thank you.
And now, on to the news:
TEXAS ICON HERB KELLEHER, founder and chairman of the board of Southwest Airlines (but not a UT alumnus), has given UT's McCombs School of Business $4 million to fund the Herb Kelleher Center for Entrepreneurship. The center, charged with creating the country's leading academic program focused on entrepreneurship, is cleared for take-off and will begin offering classes this spring. There is no word yet on whether the McCombs School will increase its supply of cocktail napkins -- the medium Herb used to sketch out Southwest's first business plan.--> SEE http://www.bus.utexas.edu/news/pressreleases/kelleher.asp
THIRTEEN GIFTED AND AMBITIOUS SCHOLARS from as far away as Spain are calling UT home this year as the inaugural class of the prestigious new Harrington Fellows Program for distinguished faculty and graduate students. "As we had hoped, the program has enabled us to attract some of the world's best minds," says UT President Larry R. Faulkner. "They bring with them tremendous talent, knowledge, and experiences."--> SEE http://www.utexas.edu/do/impact/harrington.html
IT SEEMS LIKE ONLY YESTERDAY to Robert Dedman and the Rev. Jim Fenner that they were UT Law School classmates and fellow members of the Tejas Club, but it was more than 50 years ago. In 1948, Jim loaned Robert $800 to buy a car so that he could get a better job. After a year of selling real estate and insurance, Robert paid Jim $880 - the loan in full plus 10 percent interest. Jim refused the extra $80, saying he wasn't trying to make money on the loan, just help a Tejas brother in need. Robert, who never forgot the gesture, has honored Jim and the bonds of Tejas brothers by endowing a $100,000 Tejas scholarship fund in Jim's name.

Hi Jim,

I'll make the arrangements for Henry Hu, and will let him know the
details.

Attached is the RSVP log to date for the November 2 meeting.  I've asked
George Kryder and Betsy Whitaker (the two we've not heard from yet) to
advise me of their plans ASAP.  The meeting looks like a "go", though
Tom Green, Anne McNamara and Joe Hubach won't be able to attend (Hubach
has an all day meeting but hopes to join us for drinks and dinner).

Anne McNamara wrote kindly in her RSVP that "with this small a group
perhaps we could seek a convenient time before scheduling meetings in
the future".

I'll send you for your review no later than Monday (1) a revised
proposed "organizational plan" (the written smorgasborg of options we
discussed last month), (2)a draft agenda for the meeting, and (3) a
draft cover memo from you to the ExComm members.  I recommend that we
send the approved versions of these on Tuesday or Wednesday via email.

>From the press I'm reading every day, it sounds like you must be pretty
busy!

Let me know if there is anything else you want me to do in preparation
for the upcoming meeting.

Incidentally, we had an outstanding meeting of the IOGEC Executive
Committee last week.  I'll fill you in later.

David

Dear Professor Hu, thank you for your message.  Your participation by

be very welcome.  I currently plan to be in Austin for the UT Law School
Foundation Board meeting and related matters on November 9 and 10.
Perhaps our paths will cross there.  All the best.  Jim Derrick

Jim -- I don't see any problem with this and will confirm with Mark and then get back to John.  

Just FYI, this is the same transaction in which we did not waive the conflict for Skadden to represent British Gas (BP/Chaco's partner in these negotiations), but that was only because Skadden is providing litigation support to us on the Cuiab? project and they have direct inside knowledge of our negotiation strategy on the gas side.  K&S won't have this issue.

Regards,
	John

Please see the message below.  I would appreciate your responding directly to John Keffer. Subject to the usual caveat regarding arbitration and litigation, I have no objection to John's undertaking the representation, but the two of you are better positioned than I to know whether this would be a problem.   Thank you.  Jim

Jim-I'm sorry to be bothering you about this again, but I need to get your
clearance for me to represent BP in a transaction in Bolivia where BP,
through its partially owned subsidiary Empresa Petrolera Chaco, will be
selling gas to Southern Cone Gas Ltd.  As I understand it, the gas is
intended for Enron's Cuiab? power plant in Brazil.

Thanks again.

John

 affirmed  a District Court decision of patent invalidity under the on-sale=
  provisions of 35 U.S.C. ?102(b). Robotic Vision Sys.,  Inc. v. View Eng'g=
, Inc and General Scanning, Inc., 249 F.3d  1307 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The Fede=
ral Circuit applied the new two  prong on-sale bar test from Wayne K. Pfaff=
 v. Wells Elecs.,  Inc., 525 U.S. 55 (1998).    In the Pfaff case, the Supr=
eme Court, referred to drawings  and other descriptions of an invention as =
proof that the invention  is complete and hence ready for patenting. Using =
the new Pfaff  test, the Federal Circuit held in the Robotic Vision case th=
at a software invention was ready  for patenting when one of the inventors =
verbally described the invention  to a co-worker in sufficient detail to al=
low him to practice it,  even though the actual software used to practice t=

HIGHLIGHTS

NINTH CIRCUIT USES EIGHTH AMENDMENT PROPORTIONALITY TEST TO
VOID NONCAPITAL SENTENCE IMPOSED UNDER CALIFORNIA'S THREE
STRIKES LAW

Prison terms, imposed under California's "Three Strikes"
law, that will ensure at least 50 years of incarceration for
a nonviolent recidivist convicted of petty theft violate the
Eighth Amendment, the Ninth Circuit declares. The court
finds the sentence grossly disproportionate to the gravity
of the defendant's property crimes and to comparable
sentences in other jurisdictions.

The Three Strikes law imposes a minimum 25-year sentence
without parole for any third felony offense by a defendant
with at least two prior convictions for "serious" or
"violent" felonies. The court cites several problems with
the statute, including that the triggering felony need not
be serious or violent, the prior strikes need not be violent
offenses, and there is no time period after which prior
convictions will no longer be counted as strikes. . . . Page

FRAUD ON COURT, AS OPPOSED TO FRAUD ON PTO, MAY NOT SERVE AS
GROUND FOR HOLDING PATENT UNENFORCEABLE, FEDERAL CIRCUIT
SAYS

Litigation misconduct by a patentee may be the basis for
dismissing a particular patent infringement suit but not for
finding the patent unenforceable, the Federal Circuit holds.
"Litigation misconduct, while serving as a basis to dismiss
the wrongful litigant, does not infect, or even affect, the
original grant of the property right," the court reasons.

The court distinguishes fraud on the court from inequitable
conduct before the Patent and Trademark Office in obtaining
the patent, which taints the patent itself and renders it
unenforceable by any party. The court disavows broad dicta
in a 1990 decision indicating that patents may be held
"unenforceable due to unclean hands." . . . Page 1298

PUNITIVE DAMAGES MEGA-AWARD IN EXXON VALDEZ CASE REVERSED BY
NINTH CIRCUIT AS UNCONSTITUTIONALLY EXCESSIVE

The $5 billion punitive damages award to commercial
fishermen injured by the "Exxon Valdez" oil spill is
unconstitutionally excessive, the Ninth Circuit rules. The
award is disproportionate to the $287 million compensatory
damages incurred by the plaintiffs, to potential criminal
and civil penalties, and to the $125 million restitution and
penalty settlement with federal and state authorities, the
court finds.

The unprecedented 1995 award was entered before the U.S.
Supreme Court spelled out the due process constraints on the
magnitude of punitive damages in "BMW v. Gore". Applying the
"Gore" standards, the Ninth Circuit concludes that the
district court did not properly take into account the purely
economic nature of the harm incurred by the plaintiffs, the
unintentional character of the accident, or the mitigating
actions undertaken by Exxon. . . . Page 1301

consistent with the recent changes to the Federal Credit
Union Act, the D.C. Circuit holds. . . . Page 1292

CRIMINAL LAW: The imposition of two consecutive

theft violates the Eighth Amendment's protection against
disproportionate sentences, the Ninth Circuit determines. .

Act, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals holds in a case
of first impression. . . . Page 1296

   Subject:  Career Opportunities at Enron



   Dear Mr. Derrick:

        Les LoBaugh suggested that I contact you to inquire about an
   in-house
   counsel position at Enron. I am the General Counsel of Niagara Mohawk
   Holding's
   unregulated subsidiaries, Niagara Mohawk Energy, Inc. and Niagara Mohawk
   Energy
   Marketing, Inc. We expect the sale of Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing to
   close
   in November or December of this year, pending FERC approval, and a sale
   of
   Niagara Mohawk Energy's Distributed Power and Energy Services Business
   units may
   occur contemporaneously with that closing. Therefore, I am now pursuing
   other
   career opportunities.

        I am a good candidate for an in-house counsel position at Enron
   because of
   my 12 years experience as an attorney in the energy industry. As General
   Counsel
   for the Company, I provide legal services and business advise to senior
   management and the Board of Directors of both the energy marketing and
   the
   energy services subsidiaries. My experience includes drafting and
   negotiating
   gas and electric retail sales agreements and master agreements and
   related
   documents for wholesale energy trading and marketing transactions,
   including
   physical transactions and financial instruments such as swaps. I monitor
   and I
   am responsible for representing my company in FERC and state regulatory
   proceedings. I keep up to date on the fast moving events and trends in
   the
   energy marketing and trading industry by closely monitoring regulatory
   proceedings, reading information that is published in trade and related
   energy
   industry publications and my involvement with the National Energy
   Marketers
   Association and the Federal Energy Bar Association. I am also
   responsible for
   representing the company and managing outside counsel in litigation and
   alternative dispute resolution proceedings. My experience includes
   utility
   regulatory and legal matters, the transactional work associated with
   corporate
   mergers and acquisitions, corporate governance, human resource/employee
   issues,
   interconnection agreements, municipal law, leasing, financing and
   secured
   transaction agreements, commercial contracts, condemnation litigation
   and real
   property matters.

        I have attached my resume for your review. Please contact me at
   your
   earliest convenience to schedule an interview. I look forward to hearing
   from
   you soon.

        Thank you for your consideration.

                            Very truly yours,
                            Steven R. Pincus

	Bob,

	I hope you and your family had a good Thanksgiving.

	Per our telephone conference of just a moment ago, at Jim's request, I have personally hand-delivered to your office (and to Steve Susman's office) a copy of Uriel Dutton's proposed waiver letter agreement.  Steve was out of the office, so I left a voice-mail for him.  I will be in around 7:45 a.m. tomorrow morning and look forward to speaking with you and Steve about the background and issues raised, so that we can make a decision, hopefully tomorrow, on going-forward strategy, in light of Mariner's urgent need for representation in a large corporate matter.

	Many thanks.

	Britt

Andy has hired David Gerger, a lawyer well-known to me (and a former VE
associate) to be his lawyer advising him on criminal matters.  David called
today to say that Andy was cooperating with Enron.  We talked briefly about
who Andy should hire in the Houston civil cases.  Andy's first choice is
Kirkland & Ellis.  I told David the name of several litigators there that I
like and respect.  PS to Jim, Ted Mirvis called back to say that he would be
happy to take a reporter's call about what an informal inquiry is.

The package is significantly higher than what the industry peers would receive in this position and in this market. I wish we had a chance to discuss this issue internally first.

In case I were to retain him as part of Enron Poland at a later date - I can not justify this level of remuneration as part of my budget.

Jarek

I have discussed this with Jacek.  The reason for increasing Jacek's package is retention.

Rob:

It's clear the Journal smells blood in the water surrounding Enron in

general and with respect to the limited partnership issues in particular.

My sense is that Enron's current media strategy is  to contain the story; a

worthy objective.  But I think the current approach of providing limited

disclosure, declining to answer questions and not making the CFO and other

executives available for interviews is compounding the perception that Enron

"doesn't get it". There is a real issue here that is becoming a proxy for

investors and the media who complain that the company is arrogant, lacks

transparency and does not really mean it when it says it intends to be more

open.

An internal document leaked either by an investor or an Enron insider, a

series of stories all hammering essentially the same points...these are

clear signs that the story will not go away until Enron addresses the

questions more clearly and directly.  There are ways to do so in a manner

that will not undermine the company's legal position.

As I mentioned to you in the letter sent last week, I have been in this

situation with clients many times in the past, and an outsider's perspective

is of value.  Let me know if there is an opportunity to present that

perspective.

thanks

Marc, I met this morning with an acquaintance, Eric Johnson, with respect to a product that he thought might be of interest to Enron. In our discussion it became apparent that his product is not an obvious fit with Enron, and he asked about the possibility of discussing the product with the New Power Company.  I gave him your name and number with the thought that you might direct him to the appropriate individual on the business side.  Jim

~James,
 Hi, this is Steve Callaway over at Tom James Clothing Company.  I just
wanted to take a moment and let you know about some of the holiday
promotions we are running right now.  We have the Custom shirt promo, buy
six custom shirts and get one free.  We also have our custom wraps, these
are great deals on custom clothing just for the holidays.  These all make
great gift ideas for family friends and coworkers.
  We have also added a lot to our women's line and have some exciting new
things that would make great gifts for the special ladies in your life.
Don't forget now is the time to start thinking about your formal wardrobe
with the holidays just around the corner, how is your tux looking these
days??
 I would like to meet with you in the next few weeks and show you some of
the new things we are doing this season.  You can just e-mail me to set an
appointment or give me a call at (713) 622-5678 EXT 136.  I hope things are
well with you and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Steve Callaway
Professional Clothier

Bruce,

given that Enron Europe has no relationship to speak of with Ashursts, I would not find it surprising. We have used them historically. One partner was very strong in UK gas. He left more than a year ago and since then we have not used them. We do not therefore have a relationship which would allow us to exert any influence over them.

Rob/Mark -

Would we find this surprising given any relationship that Enron has (or doesn't have) with Ashursts?

Dear Senator Leahy:

        I am Chairman of the Committee of Corporate General Counsel, which is part of the Business Law Section of the American Bar Association. Our membership is comprised of the senior-most legal officers of many of America's largest companies.

        Our members have asked me to write to you, in your capacity as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to express our views concerning the importance of the Federal Judiciary.

        The tragic events of September 11 underscore for all of us the freedoms that we enjoy in our country. We know that you and your fellow Senators on the Judiciary Committee are devoted to helping protect these precious freedoms. We also know that you and your fellow Senators recognize the critical importance of our system of justice in preserving and protecting these freedoms.

        We write to express our thanks to you and your colleagues for your efforts in reviewing the qualifications of individuals nominated for Federal District Court and Circuit Court positions. Recognizing the need for a fully-staffed Federal Judiciary, we also appreciate all your efforts in determining the qualifications of nominees for the Judiciary as expeditiously as possible.

         If our organization, or any of our members, may ever be of assistance in any way, I hope you will call upon us. Thank you.


                                        Sincerely,

We were having some retention problems with Jacek for a variety of reasons.  After discussion in London we decided to increase his package.

I believe it is highly unlikely that Jacek would be interested in working out of the Warsaw office for Enron Poland.

The package is significantly higher than what the industry peers would receive in this position and in this market. I wish we had a chance to discuss this issue internally first.

In case I were to retain him as part of Enron Poland at a later date - I can not justify this level of remuneration as part of my budget.

 Dear Bob

It was good to speak to you briefly when I was in Houston the week before
last and I am sorry we did not get the chance to meet up. As I mentioned I
have very much enjoyed working with all of the team at Enron on the ICI job
and hope that at some stage in the future we get a chance to work together
again.

There was one matter that I forgot to mention when we spoke, although
Michael Brown may already have mentioned it to you. A few weeks ago we were
asked to act for the Maharashta State Electricity Board in relation to
arbitration proceedings against Dabhol. We of course turned the job down as
we obviously did not want to act against Enron(or of course Gail) given our
existing relationship. You would of course expect nothing less but I hope
you might bear this in mind next time you have a major dispute for which you
need UK counsel. After we turned down the job I think the MSEB's next port
of call was going to be Herbert Smith, our opponents on the ICI job!

I am due to see Gail in London next week but if you are ever passing through
London I do hope you will also look me up.

With best regards

Richard

Mike -

While one paragraph states that normal destruction policies are suspended it states in the next paragraph to retain only ones related LJM.  My interpretation is "preserve anything to do with LJM and if you are unsure preserve anything you think is related to LJM until you can verify". 

Jim - This is an inquiry from our New York trading office.  


Thanks
Bruce

Paula -- we've received written questions from the New York Times for a weekend story.  I need your assistance on the following:

Why, in securities filings this year, did Enron describe its principal business as "security brokers, dealers & flotation" when before it had said it was in the business of "wholesale-petroleum & petroleum products"?

Has the board taken any action in regard to the events of the past week? 

Have they called any special meetings?  formed any special committee? 

Have they hired an attorney to review the situation? 

I know you have several meetings today, but when you get a chance, would you give me a call or email me? 

Thanks, Paula!

Dabhol and the do nothing Government

By Prem Shankar Jha

Ever since the Vajpayee's Government came to power more than two
and a half years ago, the economy has been sliding relentlessly
into the deepest recession it has ever known. In the nine months
since December industrial growth has averaged 1.7 per cent. The
decade when it averaged 9 per cent and the months, only five
years ago, when it touched 16.2 per cent, are now but a distant
memory. Consumer demand was utterly flat before the September 11
terrorist strikes in the U.S. It has now shrunk dramatically -
vehicle sales dropped by 20 percent in September and colour TV
sets registered a growth of a measly 3 to 4 per cent. With no
demand to power it, inflation, measured by the consumer price
index, has fallen almost to zero. The share market is dead and
there is no fresh investment. Employment in the organised sector
is shrinking in absolute terms for the first time in human
memory.

In the past three years two million new job seekers have tried to
find a place, however humble, in the organised sector of the
economy but been turned away. By 2004, the number will have risen
by another three million. But Mr. Yashwant Sinha is confident
that a good monsoon will revive demand and by itself solve all of
the country's problems.

But one recent event highlights the government's paralysis more
sharply than any ream of statisitcs can ever do. This is its
failure to react to the defeat in a London Consumer court of the
Maharashtra State Electricity Boards's attempt to foil Enron's
bid to take it before an international arbitration court by
claiming that a case was pending before an Indian court
challenging the arbitration clause in the power purchase
agreement.

The London Court correctly maintained that just as a government's
international obligations as defined by the Treaty or the
agreement supercede its obligations under domestic law,
proceedings in an international court must take precedence over
those in a domestic court. The way has, therefore, been cleared
for India to face the humiliation of being dragged before an
international tribunal for a breach of it contractual
obligations.

Given the fearsome proficiency of Enron's lawyers, both those
whom they retain and those who drafted the power purchase
agreement, it is virtually a foregone conclusion that the MSEB
will lose the case. If that happens, then by a conservative
estimate, India will have to pay around $5 billion, in costs and
damages. In addition it will have to spend a little more to
complete phase II of the project. Thus in the end the project is
likely to cost not $3 billion but more like $5.2 to 5.4 billion.
For much of the year or more that this demeaning dispute has
dragged on, the Centre played ostrich and pretended that this was
simply a dispute between a State Government and a private
company, and it had no say in the matter. That pretext in any
case wore thin when New Delhi refused to honour its counter-
guarantee after the MSEB stopped paying its monthly dues. But
today it has been exposed for the hollow sham it was because
neither the MSEB nor the Maharashtra Government is even capable,
let alone willing, to pay such an enormous penalty. So the bill
will, inevitably land at the Centre's door. And that means the
taxpayer's door.

The Centre will have no option but to pay. But having done so,
will it then gift the project to the Maharashtra government? The
answer, obviously, is no. What it will be forced to do is
transfer it to the National Thermal Power Corporation to complete
and operate. But since no one can possibly run a $5 billion power
plant generating 2,100 MW of power profitably, the NTPC too will
insist on the capital value of the project being substantially
written down first. Judging from the offers that the Tata
Electric Company and the Bombay Suburban Electricity Supply
Company (BSES) were making to Enron, the written down value will
not exceed $2 billion. Thus, whichever way we look at it, the
country will end by paying for a Dabhol-size power plant ($3
billion) without getting a single watt of electricity or for that
matter anything else) in return.

None of the above criticism is intended to deny that Enron
probably did gold plate the Dabhol project once the Narasimha Rao
government agreed to price its power on a cost-plus basis. Nor is
it intended to mitigate the criticism of the Rao government that
had it only brought the Maharashtra government and more
particularly the MSEB into the negotiations from the beginning
the latter's inability under law to pay backup charges at more
than twice the rate being demanded by public sector power plants
would have been exposed long ago.

But the mistakes of the past cannot in any circumstances justify
even greater mistakes in the future. For better or for worse, the
Enron deal was struck, and it was struck not once but twice. As a
serious, responsible government that knows the importance of
honouring one's word in a world where contract is king, the
Vajpayee Government must honour the country's contractual
obligations. This does not in any way preclude its trying to
alter its terms by negotiation to avoid pitfalls that it did not
see, but by definition all future changes must be by mutual
consent.

The changes that Enron will accept and will make Dabhol's power
affordable, are known to all. As the 1995 Renegotiating Committee
and the Godbole Committee recommended, the Government should buy
the $800 million LNG regasification plant and turn it into a
separate company that can supply gas to all the current and
future users on the west coast. In fact, it could go one better
and bring in a foreign strategic partner to invest in and manage
the plant. This is entirely feasible because its installed
capacity is more than twice what Dabhol is likely to need. This
will bring down the capital cost, upon which backup charges and
cost per unit of power will be calculated, to $2.2 billion.

Second, the Central Government should buy 30 per cent of the
equity in Dabhol from the promoters. This was negotiated with the
1995 committee but the MSEB could not raise the funds to do so.
This will bring down the cost that has to be serviced in foreign
exchange to $1.9 billion and the debt portion whose servicing
represents a fixed charge in foreign exchange to $1.2 billion.

The Centre could also follow up a suggestion made by the chairman
of BSES to convert a part of the foreign exchange into rupee
debt. That will reduce further the vulnerability of electricity
tariffs to changes in the exchange rate. With the price of oil
having fallen (for India) to around $20 a barrel, these changes
will bring down the cost of Dabhol's power at 90 per cent
capacity utilisation own to below Rs. 2.40 a unit. This will make
it entirely viable, especially if Maharashtra and the
neighbouring states agree to make a marginal increase in the
average power tariff or are able to bring down power theft and
reduce subsidies to the pseudo-rural sector.

The right course for the centre even at this late stage will be
to take over the project from the MSEB, renegotiate it with
Enron, or if Enron wants to opt out, then buy the project from it
at cost and make the above structural changes on its own before
handing it over to the NTPC. Getting dragged to court will
neither solve the problem of paying for Dabhol's power nor answer
the more basic question - how can any electricity grid add new
power plants to itself without raising the average tariff it
charges for electricity.

Paula -- we've received written questions from the New York Times for a weekend story.  I need your assistance on the following:

Why, in securities filings this year, did Enron describe its principal business as "security brokers, dealers & flotation" when before it had said it was in the business of "wholesale-petroleum & petroleum products"?

Has the board taken any action in regard to the events of the past week? 

Have they called any special meetings?  formed any special committee? 

Have they hired an attorney to review the situation? 

I know you have several meetings today, but when you get a chance, would you give me a call or email me? 

Thanks, Paula!

	Pete,

	I like the hell out of your idea.  I understand that you are going to continue the significant amount of spadework you have already done on the malpractice insurance and unauthorized practice of law issues, as we discussed.  If you can get those issues worked out and get management approval (and let me know how I can help with that), I will volunteer to take a case and will fly up to New York.   

	Go, man.

Enron taps credit line; stock slides

10/27/2001
Associated Press Newswires 
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. 

HOUSTON (AP) - After Enron Corp. tapped into more than $3 billion in credit in an effort to boost confidence of investors and customers, stock prices dropped. 

Enron Corp.'s stock price hit its lowest point in more than five years Friday. Shares fell 95 cents on Friday to $15.40, a level not seen since 1995, as analysts continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the company's earnings announcement earlier this month.

The stock is down more than 50 percent in two weeks, and the company lost almost $14 billion in market value. 

Late this week the company decided to convert $3 billion in revolving credit it has through various banks into cash. The company put about $1.1 billion in the bank in an effort to reassure business partners and investors of its liquidity and is using the $2.2 billion balance to begin an orderly repurchase of a certain kind of short-term corporate IOU known as commercial paper. 

"Nothing spells confidence quite like cash, which is what we want investors to understand," said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer of the $1.1 billion banked this week. 

Palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as "good management decisions." 

On Oct. 16 Enron's third-quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about: Then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, with the Enron board's approval, had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest. 

The partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron. 

Fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when Wall Street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously. But last week when the company reported a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, new questions began to arise. 

The Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships, and earlier this week Fastow was put on a leave of absence. 

Reducing the company's debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools, like a revolving line of credit, could give great peace of mind to Enron's investors, said Anatol Feygin, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. 

"It helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business, which is really the core of their operations," Feygin told the Houston Chronicle for Saturday's editions. 

Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities, still sees the move as somewhat confusing. 

"Just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus, but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange, mixed message," she said. "Do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back? Is it a gesture for customers? It first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management."

BARRON'S: REVIEW & PREVIEW

Turning Up the Heat: 

Energy trader Enron ousted its chief financial officer days after it said the SEC was conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it made with entities tied to the CFO, Andrew S. Fastow. Enron said Fastow took a leave of absence to restore investor confidence. Enron shares have plunged 50% recently, after it announced the probe and reported a $618 million loss. 



BARRON'S: The Trader

10/27/2001
Dow Jones Commodities Service

Bulls Look To Recovery, As Techs Lead The Surge 
By Andrew Barry 


-- In what undoubtedly will become a business-school case study, Enron let potentially containable concerns about some asset writedowns and a formerly obscure group of partnerships mushroom into a full-blown financial crisis last week. 

Enron's stock plunged 10.60 to 15.45, following a 10-point drop in the prior week, and the company's bonds fell sharply as yields rose to junk levels of around 10%. By week's end, Enron had drawn down $3 billion in bank credit lines to pay off nearly $2 billion in maturing commercial paper, leaving it only about $1 billion of net liquidity. 

Enron's big energy trading operation, which accounts for the bulk of the company's profits and most of its equity valuation, now may be vulnerable because it hinges on a solid credit rating and the confidence of trading counterparties. Enron faces potential debt downgrades from the major rating agencies, but the company is likely to remain an investment-grade credit. Moody's Investors Service now rates its debt Baa1, three notches above junk. 

One doomsday scenario is that counterparties on existing Enron trades, concerned about Enron's viability, push for settlement of the trades, precipitating the kind of liquidity crisis that engulfed Long-Term Capital Management in 1998. 

Despite entreaties by friendly Wall Street analysts to come clean about its financial situation, Enron has resisted, refusing to disclose the size of potential liabilities involving Enron-created partnerships whose debt is guaranteed by Enron. 

Enron called a conference call Tuesday to clear the air, but it ended up compounding its problems by failing to answer questions posed by a Boston investor about the Marlin partnership, leaving Wall Street with the clear impression that the company faces a nearly $1 billion loss on that deal. 

Some suspect that Enron stonewalling is motivated by fears that further disclosure will expose the inadequacy of the asset coverage behind its partnerships and thus significant Enron liabilities that will impair the company's credit ratings. There may also be the need for potential writedowns of various Enron assets, including its money-losing broadband business. 

Enron now trades at only a slight premium to its second-quarter book value of $13 a share, but it's worth noting that tangible book, excluding goodwill, was only $9 a share. Book value fell in the third quarter by an undetermined about because of Enron's $1 billion asset writedown and its still-mysterious $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity related to one of its partnerships. The third-quarter book value won't be known until Enron releases its balance sheet, which may not occur until its quarterly 10-Q is released. 

The Enron situation is another black eye for Wall Street research. The company was a Street favorite for years because of its strong and consistent profit growth. Enron was able to get away with providing minimal disclosure about its energy trading activities and its partnerships because analysts and investors didn't demand it. The Enron bull case essentially boiled down to the company's leadership in the booming energy trading markets and analysts' confidence in management. The Street really didn't provide much more insight than that into a company that at one point had a $75 billion valuation. That value has since shrunk to $14 billion. 

Enron's woes also show how equity analysts pay too little attention to company balance sheets. Until last week, Enron analysts still were more focused on earnings dilution than the more important issue of Enron's financial health. 

Enron had about $15 billion in debt and preferred stock outstanding at the end of the second quarter and an undetermined amount of guaranteed off-balance-sheet debt. Enron clearly ignored the importance of its balance sheet, allowing it to grow enormously over the past few years. Judging from the company's rather meager credit lines, Enron apparently figured nobody would ever doubt the financial strength of the king of the energy markets.

City - Enron directors cash in shares.

LEADING executives at Enron, the troubled US energy giant, cashed in shares worth more than $100m ( #70m) this year in the run-up to a financial crunch that has left the company's credibility in ruins. 

Research by Thomson Financial shows that Kenneth Lay, chief executive, sold about 400,000 shares this year, netting him more than $25m. He still held 2.8m shares until July.

Other executives made similar sales, a revelation likely to anger investors who have seen the shares fall from $83 at the start of the year to $45 by July. They halved again this week and fell to below $16 yesterday. Enron declined to comment on the share sales. 

Mr Lay said in a statement that he is seeking to "dispel uncertainty in the financial community" by drawing on lines of credit to restore faith in Enron's financial strength. Enron will pay off debts of $2.2 billion and keep another $800,000 in cash. He said: "We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community." 

The company is facing an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission into partnerships managed by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer. 

Mr Fastow was ousted on Wednesday night as part of the company's moves to restore confidence, though Enron insists he has done nothing wrong. 

Enron lost $1 billion in the third quarter on what it has called "failed investments".

ENRON STOCK SINKS TO 5-YEAR LOW 

Energy trading giant Enron Corp., its stocks hammered by a potential credit crunch and its chief financial officer's ouster, fell to its lowest close in more than five years on Friday. The fall was sparked by word of a big quarterly loss and a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into the ousted CFO's links to some of Enron's partnerships. Enron stock closed at $15.50, off 85 cents or 5.2 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange.

Enron Taps Credit Line; Stock Slides

Enron Corp.'s stock price hit its lowest point in more than five years Friday after it tapped into more than $3 billion in revolving credit in an effort to re-assure investors and customers. 

Shares fell 95 cents on Friday to $15.40, a level not seen since 1995, as analysts continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the company's earnings announcement earlier this month. The stock is down more than 50 percent in two weeks, and the company lost almost $14 billion in market value.

Late this week the company decided to convert $3 billion in revolving credit it has through various banks into cash. The company put about $1.1 billion in the bank in an effort to reassure business partners and investors of its liquidity and is using the $2.2 billion balance to begin an orderly repurchase of a certain kind of short-term corporate IOU known as commercial paper. 

"Nothing spells confidence quite like cash, which is what we want investors to understand," said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer of the $1.1 billion banked this week. 

Palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as "good management decisions." 

Enron's most recent woes began Oct. 16 when its third-quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about: Then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, with the Enron board's approval, had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest. 

The partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron and were formed originally as a way to offset risks associated with some of the company's newer businesses such as broadband trading. 

Fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when Wall Street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously. But last week when the company reported a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, new questions began to arise. 

Analysts began to demand more details behind the workings of the partnerships, details that Enron did not provide as quickly as some would have liked. 

Enron Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay told analysts and investors the company was careful to ensure that the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected, but The Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships, and earlier this week Fastow was put on a leave of absence. 

In drawing down the $3.3 billion line of revolving credit this week, the company put about $1.1 billion in the bank to ensure liquidity and is using the balance to begin an orderly repurchase of its commercial paper. 

Now Enron will begin repurchasing its commercial paper. This is a way for companies to raise money over a short period at rates that are usually slightly better than what banks offer, and often with more flexible terms. 

Investors in commercial paper -- who are actually more like lenders, since it's actually a form of debt -- are often fund managers who often have large sums of extra cash in search of short-term investments. 

The investors like commercial paper because it lets them earn money on cash that would sit idle otherwise and lets them do it through something issued only by companies with top credit ratings and usually backed by bank lines of credit. 

"To some extent, redeeming the commercial paper is at the expense of the capital markets, which look at it negatively," said Anatol Feygin, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. 

But reducing the company's debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools, like a revolving line of credit, could give great peace of mind to Enron's investors, he said. 

"It helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business, which is really the core of their operations," Feygin said. 

Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities, still sees the move as somewhat confusing. 

"Just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus, but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange, mixed message," she said. "Do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back? Is it a gesture for customers? It first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management." 

Jeff Dietert, an analyst at Simmons & Co., said Enron management needs to continue to make clear the issues that have investors confused and concerned. 

In a worst-case scenario, investor fears could create a vicious cycle that continues to drive the stock down, which would force bond rating agencies to consider downgrades of Enron. That could lead to lower credit ratings, which would force Enron's energy trading partners to limit their exposure to the company and cut back on business with it. 

"Thus, we see a big incentive for Enron to clarify the issues," Dietert wrote in a report Friday. "Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off." 

Feygin said he also believes the company will continue to do better in revealing its financial dealings but thinks there may be more surprises in store. 

For example, a Wall Street Journal article Friday discussed for the first time another business entity with ties to Enron known as Chewco. It was formed in 1997 with about $400 million in financial backing to buy interests in unnamed Enron assets. 

Chewco was run by Michael Kopper, a managing director of Enron's Global Equity Markets Group. 

"Frankly, that was the first time I had ever heard of that entity," Feygin said. "Until now, everything that's come out I've at least heard of or had some idea of what they were from the company's filings or discussions. This is something I had never heard of before."

Enron Taps All Its Credit Lines To Buy Back $3.3 Billion of Debt
By FLOYD NORRIS

The New York Times 
Page 2, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company 

The Enron Corporation, trying to reassure investors that it has ample liquidity, began to repurchase all its outstanding commercial paper yesterday, using $3.3 billion it borrowed from banks by depleting its lines of credit. 

An Enron spokesman said that when the commercial paper repurchases are completed the company will retain more than $1 billion in cash.

The moves did not appear to reassure investors, as Enron's share price fell to another six-year low. Shares traded as low as $15.04 yesterday, before ending the day at $15.40, down 95 cents. 

The move will raise the interest expense for the company, because banks normally charge more than companies have to pay in the commercial paper market, and because its outstanding debt will rise by the additional $1 billion. 

Enron's debt is rated investment grade. But its bonds now trade below investment grade levels, although not so low that it appears investors fear an early default. But with the bonds trading so low, it is unlikely Enron will be able to sell more commercial paper. 

Enron's stock has been plunging since Oct. 17, shortly after it disclosed that its third-quarter balance sheet, which has yet to be released, will show a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity as a result of complicated transactions involving partnerships formerly controlled by Andrew Fastow, who was the company's chief financial officer until he was replaced on Wednesday. 

The stock has lost more than half its value since the earnings announcement, and the company has disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission has asked questions about its accounting practices.

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $3-billion credit line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low-interest, short-term loans. 

The company's stock has fallen 54% in the last 14 days after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by Enron's former chief financial officer. The shares fell 95 cents, or 5.8%, to $15.40 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Investors said Chief Executive Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure them that the company's credit rating won't be cut. Enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets, where short-term loans carry lower rates than banks offer. 

"Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No," said John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth Third Bancorp. "People are questioning the credibility of management." 

The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion in commercial paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. 

The price of Enron's 6.75% bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 11/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86 cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating of BBB+, yield 9.53%. 

Investors have grown concerned that the firm's credit rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from failed investments. Enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions. 

Enron's decision to tap its credit line was "a smart financial move," said Stephen Moore of Moody's Investors Service. "It took away the hassle and time-consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and insured access to capital."

Enron, the Houston-based energy trading giant, continued to pay the price for financial opacity as its stock slumped to its lowest level since 1995 and its five-year bonds traded at 77 cents in the dollar with a yield of 11.13 per cent, down from 83 cents on Thursday. Bond prices at these levels normally suggest that investors expect a company to file for bankruptcy. Page 10.

HIGHLIGHTS
__________


EPA NOMINEE URGES CAREFUL BALANCING OF ACCESS TO
INFORMATION, SECURITY

President Bush's choice to become EPA's chief information
officer tells a Senate committee that public access to EPA
data will have to be more carefully balanced with growing
concerns that such data could be of use to terrorists. "I've
always been a very staunch advocate for public access to
information," Kimberly Terese Nelson tells the Senate
Environmental and Public Works Committee. "However, Sept. 11
did change some things." EPA's Office of Environmental
Information has removed general risk management information
from the agency's Web site and is reviewing manuals and
information products for data that could compromise national
security. . . . Page A-1

1,100 ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS CALL FOR DEEP CUTS IN POWER PLANT
EMISSIONS

A coalition of 1,100 national and local environmental groups
plans to release principles today emphasizing large cuts in
power plant pollution--a sign the groups are not willing to
compromise on legislation introduced by Sen. Jeffords that
is opposed by the Bush administration and industry groups.
The release of the principles comes as Jeffords, chairman of
the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, is
planning a hearing next week on his legislation (S. 556),
which calls for major reductions in power plant emissions of
sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide
by 2007. . . . Page A-1

RESEARCHER SUGGESTS USING EMISSIONS TRADING TO CUT POWER
PLANT POLLUTION

If emission allowances for power plant pollution are
distributed through a government-led auction among electric
utilities, the cost of carbon reductions would be
dramatically reduced, suggests a researcher. . . . Page A-11

EPA CLOSE TO COMPLETING PROPOSAL ON RECYCLING OF CATHODE RAY
TUBES

EPA is close to completing long awaited rules on recycling
cathode ray tubes and disposing of solvent-contaminated shop
towels and wipes, according to the director of EPA's Office
of Solid Waste, Elizabeth Cotsworth. She says the rules on
cathode ray tubes, aimed at removing some of the regulatory
barriers industry faces in recycling the tubes, are headed
to the White House Office of Management and Budget for
review. Cathode ray tubes are major sources of lead and
mercury in the country's waste stream. . . . Page A-2

SNOWE INTRODUCES BILL TO REQUIRE CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS
OF TRUCKERS

Companies that transport hazardous materials would have to
conduct background investigations of drivers and document
the drivers' identities under legislation introduced by Sen.
Snowe.  Employers would have to obtain fingerprints and
photographs of job applicants and conduct criminal
background checks on applicants for jobs with access to very
sensitive hazardous materials. Immigration and
naturalization service records also would have to be
reviewed under provisions in Snowe's bill (S. 1557).
"Federal authorities already recommend that companies hiring
drivers conduct these tests, and my legislation will simply
make this a mandatory requirement," Snowe says. . . . Page

DOE SELECTS PROCESS FOR SEPARATING MATERIAL IN RADIOACTIVE
SALT WASTE

The Energy Department chooses a process to separate
high-activity and low-activity portions of high-level
radioactive salt waste stored at the Savannah River Site in
South Carolina. The department says it will use "caustic
side solvent extraction" to separate highly radioactive
components of the radioactive salt waste from the
low-activity constituents. . . . Page A-6

OZONE HOLE OVER ANTARCTIC SAID NOT TO HAVE GROWN OVER PAST
THREE YEARS

The hole in the stratospheric ozone layer has not grown in
the past three years because the level of ozone-destroying
chlorine compounds has peaked and is beginning to decline,
according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. Satellite data show the area of the ozone
hole above Antarctic peaked at about 26 million square
kilometers, making it about the same size as North America
and similar to its size over the past three years. . . .

PANEL HAS LITTLE CONCERN ABOUT EXPOSURE TO METHANOL IN DIET,
AT WORK

A federal advisory panel concludes that it has "minimal
concern" that normal exposures to methanol through diet or
in the workplace will harm human development or
reproduction. However, the panel is more concerned over the
effects of high accidental exposures on human development.
EPA is assessing the risks of methanol to develop an
inhalation standard. . . . Page A-5

MEETING ADVANCES CAUSE FOR HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS, PESTICIDES
TREATY

The three-year-old Rotterdam Convention on the prior
informed consent procedure for certain hazardous chemicals
and pesticides moves closer to coming into force after the
conclusion of talks at the headquarters of the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization. The talks feature delegates from
102 countries meeting in dozens of small groups to "close
the open paragraphs" in the Rotterdam Convention, says one
observer. . . . Page A-8

U.N. PANEL REPORTS ON MAXIMUM RESIDUE LIMITS FOR 26
PESTICIDES IN FOOD

An international scientific panel recommends maximum residue
limits for 26 pesticides in food that ultimately may be used
by some countries to determine what food products are
acceptable in trade. The Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residues
for 2001 recommends the residue limits to the Codex
Alimentarius Committee on Pesticide Residues. . . . Page

OVERFISHING, HABITAT DAMAGE SEEN AS WORSE THAN POLLUTION FOR
OCEANS

Destruction of aquatic habitats and overfishing are having a
greater adverse impact on international waterways than is
pollution, says Dag Daler, project manager for the global
water assessment effort and a participant in a United
Nations-sponsored conference in Sweden. About 120 conferees
representing 40 countries attend the first general assembly
of the Global International Waters Assessment, a United
Nations Environment Program project. . . . Page A-9

WETLANDS
________

NATIONWIDE PERMITS: A proposal by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to reissue nationwide permits authorizing activity
in wetlands should not include changes that weaken
environmental protections until a comprehensive assessment
of the program is complete, says EPA comments to the corps.
Developers, who are subject to the nationwide permit
requirements under the Clean Water Act, deride the proposal
as doing little to correct flaws they say are inherent in
the program. Environmental advocates criticize the proposal,
saying the permit program has resulted in thousands of acres
of lost wetlands. . . . Page A-3

In addition I understand from Tim DeSpain that they are holding Treasury funds pending payment of fees, and that he is pursuing this issue too.   Equity Trust acts as the sole Director for these companies which means that only Equity Trust can sign corporate documents on behalf of these companies.  They prepare and register all necessary filings (numerous) with the Companies Register and advise us and keep us in line on Dutch corporate law. They will not advise us on Dutch bankruptcy proceeding requirements until we make good on the outstanding amount. 

Outstanding fees total EUR 173,595.16 which equals appx. US$154,309 plus we would need a float going forward so that they could draw from it.

Invoices are up to 12 months old and many of them are the responsibility of Enron Europe group.

None of the companies involved has filed for bankruptcy.

The package is significantly higher than what the industry peers would receive in this position and in this market. I wish we had a chance to discuss this issue internally first.

In case I were to retain him as part of Enron Poland at a later date - I can not justify this level of remuneration as part of my budget.

I have discussed this with Jacek.  The reason for increasing Jacek's package is retention.

Jim/Rob -

As Paul Kraske suggested in this e-mail today, I'm going to get Bill Lawler
from V&E involved in the India judicial probe analysis.  As you will
recall, Bill has helped us with the China problems and issues that came up
in India earlier this year (particularly charitable contributions) and more
recently with the criminal charges against Sanjeev relating to certain
quarry leases.

Let me know if you have any comments or objections to our involving Bill on
this issue.

Thanks,
Bruce

Vicki-I apologize again for a K&S partner having attended the initial
meeting between Enron and Home Depot yesterday before you and Jim Derrick
had an opportunity to review our waiver request.  As I mentioned to you
yesterday, none of the lawyers who worked on the Electrolux matter (myself,
Ken Culotta and Kevin Keenan) will have any involvement in the Home Depot
matter.  I can also confirm that the amount of work Erik Swenson (who would
lead the project on behalf of Home Depot) has done for Enron to date has
been minimal and none of it has involved EES's energy outsourcing business.

As I believe both clients are anxious to work on the potential transaction,
please let me know of the waiver as soon as you can.

Regards

John

Subject:	Jeff McMahon Named CFO


Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

I have discussed this with Jacek.  The reason for increasing Jacek's package is retention.

>
> 1.	The general outline of the Committee's report is great and I
> commend the Committee for its efforts.  I support expanding the scope
> of the Center, moving to a simplified dues based membership and
> rotating (with some modification) the membership of the Executive
> Committee.
>
> 2.	I have some concerns with some of the specifics inside that
> broad outline, however.
>
> 	a.	My perspective is somewhat parochial.  I am concerned
> primarily about preserving the Center as a vibrant forum for oil & gas
> lawyers.  I concur in the recommendation of the Membership Committee
> to expand the scope of the Center to include a broad segment of the
> energy industry, but we should be careful to find a way to do so which
> does not impair the ability also to maintain focus on specific
> segments of the industry.  As a way of accomplishing this goal, my
> thought would be to provide for separate "practice groups" (e.g.,
> committees) within the Center for oil & gas, power, energy marketing &
> trading ("emt") and coal & nuclear ("energy mining") (and possibly
> others).   There would be no limitation on belonging to more than one
> practice group.  (As a side note, this would actually serve to
> increase Jones Day's participation because we would have separate
> lawyers on each committee who might not otherwise participate if we
> did not provide an opportunity for such "pluralism").
>
> 	b.	As part of the effort at maintaining "pluralism," my
> thought also is to provide for a seat on the Executive Committee for
> the chair of each practice group.  This would help avoid the potential
> that the Center might become dominated (as occurred, for example, with
> the old SONREEL) by one group or another.  To assist in
> institutionalizing the diversity, the Executive Committee would be
> composed of the officers, the chairs of the various committees
> (program, membership, information, etc.) and the chair of each
> practice group.  In order to preserve the rotation anticipated by the
> Membership Committee recommendations, the chairs of the committees and
> practice groups could be limited to two year terms.  They would stay
> on the Executive Committee once their term as chair expired only if
> selected to an officer position within the Center.  The initial terms
> of the practice group chairs could be staggered so that not every
> chair would rotate off at the same time.  In order to provide maximum
> opportunity for participation in leadership positions, the term of the
> officers could be set to a year.
>
> 	c.	I think it is also important as a part of maintaining
> "pluralism" to ensure that the individual practice groups (rather than
> an overall Program Committee) serve as the primary focus for the
> development and presentation most of the Center's programs.  In other
> words, the oil & gas practice group would be responsible for the
> Annual Oil & Gas Institute; the power practice group would be
> responsible for developing an Annual Power Institute and so on.  This
> would ensure that the Center's programs remain responsive to the
> individual interests of the practice areas rather than become tilted
> in one direction or another.  The practice groups could decide to put
> on joint programs with each other and, each year, the overall program
> committee chair would decide whether to put on one or more overall
> programs (such as an "Introduction to Energy Law" program).
>
> 	d.	While I would leave it to the individual practice groups
> to decide on the location and length of the Institutes, I must admit
> that I am uncomfortable with going to a one-day Annual Oil & Gas
> Institute.   I think that such an approach would limit the ability of
> the chairs to provide quality programming and would limit the
> attractiveness of the programs.  Thinking personally for a moment, I
> would be less inclined to incur the travel dollars (or to authorize
> the travel dollars of others in the Firm) if they are only going to
> "buy" a one-day program.  If we are going to incur CLE-related travel
> dollars, especially to remote sites such as Calgary or London, my view
> is that the bigger bang (credits) for the buck, the better.
>
> 	e.	Finally, as a potential contributor, I want to make
> certain that the significant contributors have some continuing role in
> the operation of the Center, even if they don't have a representative
> on the Executive Committee.  I think that the Advisory Committee is
> well placed to serve that function.  To that end I would suggest that
> the Advisory Committee be composed of former officers (in the manner
> suggested by the Membership Committee report), plus a member
> designated by every company/firm stepping up to a given dues level.
> Unlike the Executive Committee, the members of the Advisory Committee
> (other than those participating in their status as former officers)
> should not be required to rotate.  A company/firm can maintain its
> same delegate to the Advisory Committee for as long as it desires.
> This would preserve some continuity and, also, not interfere with
> decisions made by those bodies maintaining financial commitments to
> the Center.
>
> Anyway, these are my thoughts.  I look forward to the discussion
> Friday.

The Dabhol mtg. today at 4:30 has been cancelled.  Kean called and said Lay is having a meeting w/Kean and others at 5:00 re: investors.  My question is:  The Dabhol mtg. is rescheduled to 12:00 tomorrow.  You have Amy Dunn Taylor luncheon at Brennan's tomorrow.  Rob will have to cancel the Amy Dunn Taylor thing and do the Dabhol.  Are you going to do the Dabhol and should I cancel you out of the Amy Dunn Taylor thing also.

Dear Mr. Derrick:

	Thank you for your e-mails.  It would be wonderful if we did get a chance
to meet in person while you're in Austin - whether you're here in
connection with this upcoming Law School Foundation meeting or here later
on for some other reason.

	Of course, at a minimum, I hope to be able to come to the
to-be-newly-scheduled meeting of the Institute for Law & Technology and
meet you there.  Yesterday, I received the 10/29/01 memo from David
Ellwanger and the accompanying binder.  There is a reference on page 27 of
the binder to a preliminary plan for the Institute that has been developed
by David Winn.  Would it make sense for this preliminary plan to be
circulated to committee members ahead of time?

	Incidentally, I read this morning of Bill's election to Enron's board - as
you know, he is outstanding.

	Best regards.

I am attaching herewith a short note on J Kurdukar alongwith his
photograph.
The note contains my personal analysis of Kurdukar. We may further do some
research on his judgements & Narmada report to understand him better.
Thanks & regards.........suhas

Subject:  Judicial Probe

Wade-

Suhas called to let me know that former justice of the supreme court J
Kurdukar has been appointed as the presiding judge of the GOM commission of
inquiry.  We anticipate a formal notification by the GOM of the probe and
its terms of reference some time later today.  From what I understand he is
considered more objective than some of the other proposed candidates and,
to that extent, he may be less likely to mount a crusade against the
company and its officers and directors.  At the same time, he is renowned
for the glacial pace of the proceedings over which he presides.  Evidently,
he tends to allow every interested party opportunities to intervene and be
heard and the Narmada Dam resettlement which he evidently has also
overseen, has dragged on for most of the last ten years. We'll try to find
out a little more about what he's done recently and let you know what the
bio looks like.

Obviously another logistical question of interest is how long it will
actually take the commission to get up and running.  Suhas seemed to think
it would take a couple of weeks for Kurdukar to organize financing from the
GOM (good luck) and get a small staff together.  Needless to say, if there
are other actions which we contemplate taking prior to the commission being
convened, we probably should not wait.

Paul

Jim

Hi there, following up from my call earlier...

I am working as part of a team implementing financial trading agreements with our intra group counterparties. Part of that process involves contacting the directors of each enterprise and clarifying certain pieces of information. I know that you are a director of the following companies:

Enron Trading Services Inc
Enron Metals and Commodities Ltd
Enron Metal Brokers Ltd
Enron Metals Far East Ltd

Could I ask that you confirm the following with respect to each company?

Whose signature would be required on any new trading agreement for the company?
Would there need to be a corporate resolution in order to sign the new trading agreement?

Thanking you very much in advance for your time,

Best Regards
Lauren Christie
(London Office)

POWER BRIEFS
FRIDAY, JUNE 1, 2001



* * * DELIVERING ON THE STRATEGY  - On Tuesday, May 30th, NewPower celebrat=
ed a record-breaking day in customer sign ups. Between the Charlotte and He=
rndon facilities, and the company's outbound telemarketing efforts, NewPowe=
r booked more than 1,300 accounts for the day!  Approximately 572 new custo=
mers called in to our center to come onboard for a gas plan, while approxim=
ately 390 called in for electric.  Total (gas and electric) residential out=
bound telemarketing efforts for the day brought in approximately 287 new cu=
stomers, while outbound telemarketers enrolled approximately 63 new small c=
ommercial customers.  Since August, NewPower has enrolled roughly 120,000 g=
as and electric customers.  The count for the end of June is estimated at 1=
24,000 (this does not take into account Tuesday's remarkable results).  Thi=
s is the beginning of great things to come for NewPower's marketing and cus=
tomer contact efforts.   Please share the great news with contractors and c=
onsultants.

Jim,

Bear Paw Energy, an entity acquired by Northern Border Partners, LP in March has been sued in District Court in Denver by a former employee over alleged promises concerning ownership in Bear Paw. Through Britt Davis and Bonnie White, we received several recommendations for counsel. We spoke with Larry Treece, the partner at Sherman & Howard who previously handled an arbitration involving Western Gas Resources and EPP. If there are no conflicts, we will likely engage the firm of  Sherman & Howard. Please let me know if you have any concerns with this engagement. Thank you .

Janet

Thanks, Jim.  I hope your schedule clears up and you can be there, but I
understand if you can't.

On the Tech Law front, so far we have acceptances for the November 2
meeting from Tom Klitgaard, Joe Sims, Larry Lyles (meeting only), Joe
Hubach (reception/dinner only), (you, me and David Ellwanger).

Tom Green is unable to attend, as is Anne McNamara (who wrote:  "David,
with a group this small, perhaps you could check dates before setting
the meeting.  Just a thought.").

I've not yet heard from Coggins, Hu, Kryder or Whitaker.

I'll update this RSVP report next week.

David

       This is your reminder of our special meeting next Friday to
continue
   our long-range planning and restructuring of the IOGEC as we expand
our
   scope and membership to include new fields of energy law.  A number
of
   the issues left on the table at our mid-year meeting in August should
be
   resolved now as we get ready for the annual Institute in February and
   begin a concurrent membership drive.  Lunch will be served.  As we
have
   much to discuss, the meeting may run to 4:00 or so.

       If you have not yet advised David Winn whether you will attend,
   please do so now ( dwinn@swlegal.org <mailto:dwinn@swlegal.org> ;
   972-664-3488).

           An agenda will be sent to you next week in advance of the
   meeting. Thanks again for your wisdom and your leadership.

Jim:

I can imagine the firestorm and I trust you would let me know if we could
somehow be of assistance. I can't think of a better group to weather the
circumstances than you and your extremely talented team.

I will keep this brief. Carrin requested an asset allocation model based on
your combined assets.  Pls let me know if you are comfortable with our
including the detail of your assets in a presentation to Carrin.

We hoped to respond to Carrin today but I will not do so until I hear from
you.

Regards.

HOG FARMS TO INSTALL NEW TECHNOLOGY, PAY FINE FOR CLEAN
WATER VIOLATIONS

Premium Standard Farms and Continental Grain Co. reach an
agreement with EPA and a citizens group requiring the hog
producers to install as much as $50 million in new
technologies to address violations of the Clean Water Act
from their concentrated animal feeding operations. The
consent decree, which also requires the companies to pay a
$350,000 civil penalty, stems from a 1997 lawsuit brought by
the Citizens Legal Environmental Action Network against the
two companies, which together comprise the second largest
hog producer in the United States. . . . Page A-1

BALLAST WATER MANAGEMENT REPORT REQUIRED OF SHIPS ENTERING
U.S. WATERS

Ships entering U.S. waters will have to submit a ballast
water management report under a final U.S. Coast Guard rule
designed to control the introduction of invasive species.
The rule also provides voluntary ballast water management
guidelines for operators of vessels entering U.S. waters
from beyond the United States exclusive economic zone and
promotes ballast water management for all vessels operated
in U.S. waters. . . . Page A-1

UNIFORM LAW SOUGHT FOR STATES TO ENFORCE RESTRICTIONS ON
BROWNFIELDS

A proposal for a uniform law for all states to follow that
would allow land-use restrictions on contaminated property
to be enforced when ownership is transferred is being
drafted by an organization of attorneys appointed by state
governments. The goal for most polluted industrial sites,
such as brownfields, is to redevelop and to reuse the land,
according to Bill Breetz, an attorney with the National
Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.
Currently, Breetz says, no state has a law making
environmental covenants on land enforceable when the
property changes hands. . . . Page A-2

COUNTER-TERRORISM BECOMES FOCUS OF EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
MEETING

In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, EPA
decides to place special emphasis on the subject of
counter-terrorism measures during a December meeting on
chemical emergency preparedness and prevention. EPA was
planning next month's conference before the terrorist
attacks in Washington and New York, but changes the agenda
for emergency responders, state and local emergency
planners, industry representatives, and regulators to focus
heavily on "the best ways to combat terrorism." . . . Page

FEDERAL COURT RULES SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA MUST BOOST MASS
TRANSIT USE

The agency responsible for transportation planning in the
San Francisco Bay Area must boost the use of public transit
to a level it set in a 1982 clean air plan. The U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California
issues the decision in a case involving a ridership goal the
Metropolitan Transportation Commission set in the Bay Area
portion of California's state implementation plan. The
opinion is a victory for environmental groups that have
spent years trying to persuade the commission to devote more
resources to programs designed to improve transit ridership.

HABITAT DESIGNATION SOUGHT FOR ENDANGERED PLANT SPECIES IN
CALIFORNIA

Two environmental groups file suit to compel the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service to designate critical habitat
protection for eight plants classified as either endangered
or threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act. The
California Native Plant Society and the Center for
Biological Diversity file the complaint in U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of California seeking

TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS CONSIDERED FOR STREAMLINED
ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS

Federal highway and transit officials consider establishing
a short list of transportation projects that would be
monitored to ensure they do not get hung up in lengthy
environmental permitting and review processes. The Federal
Highway Administrator and the Federal Transit Administrator
are considering establishing a list of projects that would
receive special oversight to ensure all efforts are made to
streamline environmental reviews and permitting decisions,
an FHWA official tells a federal interagency group. . . .

NORDIC NATIONS PREPARE TO LAUNCH KYOTO RATIFICATION EFFORTS
BY YEAR END

The five Nordic governments, generally satisfied with
negotiations that completed an international climate change
agreement, will begin asking their national parliaments to
ratify the accord before the end of this year, government
officials from the five nations tell BNA. They say
ratification by all the Nordic countries should occur before
the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg
in September 2002. . . . Page A-6

TEXAS: The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission
approves a new program that will allow information collected
by citizens about possible environmental violations to be
used as evidence in enforcement cases. The program, which
takes effect Jan. 1, allows citizen-collected information to
be used as evidence if certain requirements are met. . . .

AIR POLLUTION:  New York state's highest court declines to
hear an appeal of a lower court decision that required the
state power authority to conduct an environmental impact
statement for 11 small natural gas-powered electric
generating units. The case stems from the installation of
the units by the state's power authority earlier this year
to meet the summer electricity needs of New York City. . . .

Dear Stephen, 
I naturally follow with interest the Enron discussions in India. We do have  
reasonably good relations in the energy policy field in India, and I in  
particular with the Indian energy regulator. 
We do offer a deal mediation/conciliation service. My sentiment is that your  
negotiations in India have reached locked position, out of which it is  
normally almost impossible to extricate. 
You might consider or put me in touch with the senior Enron staff to see if  
they would be interested in a conciliation/deal mediation project. 
regards, tw

HIGHLIGHTS

INTERIOR'S REVISIONS OF HARDROCK MINING REGULATIONS
CHALLENGED IN COURT

Environmental groups amend a lawsuit in federal district
court to overturn recent revisions the Department of
Interior made to rules regulating mining on public lands.
Claiming the revisions further weaken the environmental
mining rules, the Mineral Policy Center, Great Basin Mine
Watch, and Guardians of Our Rural Environment challenge
Interior Secretary Norton's decisions on the grounds they
violate the Federal Land Policy and Management Act's mandate
"to prevent undue degradation" of public lands. The groups
also asked the U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia to prevent the Norton mining rules from taking
effect while the court considers the case. . . . Page A-1

EPA TO PROPOSE EMISSIONS LIMITS FOR ASPHALT PROCESSING
OPERATIONS

EPA is proposing air toxics emissions standards for asphalt
processing and asphalt roofing manufacturers. The proposed
rule would apply to facilities that produce "blown" asphalt
for use in making roof shingles. The proposal also would
apply to plants that apply blown asphalt to fiberglass or
apply felt to produce shingles. The proposed rule is ready
for publication in the "Federal Register", but its
publication date is not set. . . . Page A-2

http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/den.nsf/id/a0a4y6f4d4_


NEW YORK ENACTS NEW RULES FOR PROPOSED ELECTRIC GENERATING
FACILITIES

Gov. Pataki signs legislation to expand the environmental
requirements power companies must meet before they can
participate in New York's expedited approval process for new
or modified electric generating facilities. Under the new
law, power companies must demonstrate their proposed
facility would be equipped with technologies that avoid or
minimize the number of aquatic organisms that are impinged
on filtering screens or entrained in intake systems used to
draw water to cool electric generation equipment. . . . Page
A-9

http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/den.nsf/id/a0a4y6f4p1_


NEW DATA REVIEWED AS EPA CONSIDERS CHANGES TO ANIMAL FEEDLOT
PROPOSAL

More flexible approaches to regulating water pollution from
livestock operations are being considered by EPA as the
result of new data received on a proposed rule to curb
discharges from these facilities. A "notice of data
availability" contains information the agency is considering
to refine its cost and economics model used in the proposed
rule that would set effluent limitation guidelines for
concentrated animal feeding operations. . . . Page A-4

CALIFORNIA CONCENTRATES ON HEXAVALENT CHROMIUM RULE FOR
DRINKING WATER

California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard
Assessment pulls the plug on its suggested "public health
goal" for total chromium in drinking water because it was
based on potentially flawed science. Allan Hirsch, a
spokesman for the agency, says rather than set a new goal
for total chromium, the state will focus on establishing a
goal for hexavalent chromium, also called chromium 6. The
California Department of Health Services is required to
adopt a chromium 6 standard by January 2004. . . . Page A-11

IRRIGATION DISTRICT TO PAY FOR HABITAT PROJECTS TO SETTLE
PESTICIDE LITIGATION

An Oregon irrigation district agrees to pay $100,000 for
habitat protection projects to resolve Clean Water Act
litigation concerning aquatic herbicide applications under a
proposed consent decree filed in  the U.S. District Court
for the District of Oregon. The case stems from the Talent

COURT PERMITS PRIVATE GROUPS TO APPEAL DECISION AFFECTING
COHO SALMON

A federal judge tells a consortium of environmental groups
they may intervene to appeal a district court ruling
affecting the listing of salmon as an endangered species.
After the National Marine Fisheries Service announced it
would not appeal the district court's decision that the
agency had erred when listing only wild and not
hatchery-reared Oregon Coastal coho salmon under the
Endangered Species Act, Earthjustice and other environmental
and fishing requested to intervene for the purposes of
appeal. . . . Page A-6

AIR DISTRICT APPROVES PLAN TO CUT DUST IN CALIFORNIA'S MAIN
FARMING AREA

The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District
approves a measure to reduce dust from unpaved roads,
parking lots, and storage areas. The rule is developed to
address the air pollution problems in the 25,000-square-mile
Central Valley, the state's main agricultural area, and to
prevent EPA from blocking more than $2 billion in federal
transportation funds. . . . Page A-10

HIGHWAY AGENCY, ARMY CORPS ADDRESS WETLANDS ISSUES, ROAD
PROJECTS

Officials from the Federal Highway Administration and the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are working to address issues
that can impede efficient wetlands permitting processes for
transportation projects, officials tell an interagency
meeting. As a result of a workshop on environmental
streamlining, FHWA and corps officials are discussing a
range of options for streamlining the Clean Water Act
Section 404 permitting process for transportation projects
that affect wetlands. . . . Page A-6

DOE'S INSPECTOR GENERAL CITES LAW FIRM FOR POTENTIAL
CONFLICT OF INTEREST

A law firm contracted by the Energy Department to work on
the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository may have
violated the conflict-of-interest terms of its contract by
continuing to lobby on behalf of the Nuclear Energy
Institute, according to a report from the DOE Office of
Inspector General. Nevada's two senators, both of whom
strongly oppose the Yucca Mountain project, blast the law
firm of Winston & Strawn for "misconduct" and vowed to
pursue "every possible legal remedy." . . . Page A-8

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

TRANSPORT: Legislation intended to protect the public
against the threat of chemical attacks has aroused the
opposition of hazardous materials transporters who say it
could hamper the Department of Transportation's authority to
regulate hazardous materials. The Chemical Security Act (S.
1602) would allow EPA to issue administrative orders and to
secure relief through litigation when there is an "imminent
and substantial endangerment from a potential accident or
criminal release." The proposal has the potential to
threaten Transportation's authority to regulate hazmat, says
the National Association of Chemical Distributors. . . .
Page A-3

http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/den.nsf/id/a0a4y6e0k3_

HAZARDOUS WASTE: Three wastes generated mainly from
inorganic chemical manufacturing processes are now listed as
hazardous waste in a final EPA rule to be published today.
The three wastes--K176, K177, and K178--will now be
regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act's
hazardous waste management rules. . . . Page A-2

http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/den.nsf/id/a0a4y6g8t9_

RESEARCH: EPA awards more than $22 million in grants to
universities to establish five hazardous substance research
centers. The centers will research potential effects of
hazardous substances in the environment and will provide
community outreach, according to EPA Administrator Whitman.

Dear General Counsels:

As part of my work with the Enron Compliance Report, I am working with the Enron Assurance Services Network formed by Rick Causey to ensure audit activities are aligned with management objectives.

There are several EAS leaders reporting to Tod Lindholm and Shawn Kilchrist.  Tod and Shawn report to Rick Causey  with a dotted line to the Audit Committee of the Enron Corp. Board of Directors.  The EAS leaders are dedicated to improving controls and are responsible to each business unit for its internal controls.

The EAS leaders are:
	Michelle Atwood - ENA, GM, IM, RAC
	Paul Bromley - Enron Europe
	Misty Barrett - EES
	Vicki Gregorcyk - EBS
	Terri Wheeler - Enron Corp.
	Sutton - ETS 
	John Berggren - International

 I am working with each of the EAS leaders in connection with our Reporting of Incidents under the Enron Compliance Report for calendar year 2001.  They will help us ensure that we are capturing and reporting all incidents.  Of course, the attorney client privilege and confidentiality will be maintained.

The EAS leader for your respective business unit will be in touch with you regarding the internal control environment and improvements thereto.  

Thank you in advance for your help.

Sharon

Jim,

We need to advise the Executive Committee members that the November 2
meeting is canceled so they can free next Friday up on their calendars.

Shall I send the memo below (after you've added the dates you propose
and made any other modifications you wish), or would you rather I
contact them myself and simply tell them to stand by for more
information?

Thanks.

David

RE: Our Inaugural Meeting

Due to conflicts in several of our members' schedules, I have determined
to re-schedule our inaugural meeting from November 2 to a later date. I
hope this does not greatly inconvenience those of you who have already
made your plans to attend on the 2nd.

Rather than simply announcing the new date, I'd like to try to find a
date suitable for all members. Please advise David Winn (
<mailto:(dwinn@swlegal.org> dwinn@swlegal.org or 972-664-3488) of your
availability on the following dates for our meeting in Dallas - as we
originally planned, we will begin with a working lunch at 12:00 p.m.
followed by drinks and an early dinner afterwards:

a) ____________

b) ____________

c) ____________

d) ____________

After reviewing your responses, we'll promptly schedule our meeting for
the date most convenient to the greatest number of committee members and
notify you of the new date.

Please pardon this change in plans. I do think it is important that we
have a full attendance as we chart our course for our first year, and
I'm looking forward to getting on with our work.

Dear Senator Leahy:

        I am Chairman of the Committee of Corporate General Counsel, which
is part of the Business Law Section of the American Bar Association. Our
membership is comprised of the senior-most legal officers of many of
America's largest companies.

        Our members have asked me to write to you, in your capacity as
Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to express our views concerning
the importance of the Federal Judiciary.

        The tragic events of September 11 underscore for all of us the
freedoms that we enjoy in our country. We know that you and your fellow
Senators on the Judiciary Committee are devoted to helping protect these
precious freedoms. We also know that you and your fellow Senators recognize
the critical importance of our system of justice in preserving and
protecting these freedoms.

        We write to express our thanks to you and your colleagues for your
efforts in reviewing the qualifications of individuals nominated for Federal
District Court and Circuit Court positions. Recognizing the need for a
fully-staffed Federal Judiciary, we also appreciate all your efforts in
determining the qualifications of nominees for the Judiciary as
expeditiously as possible.

         If our organization, or any of our members, may ever be of
assistance in any way, I hope you will call upon us. Thank you.

IN THE MONEY: Enron - From Energy Trader To Spinmeister
By Carol S. Remond

A Dow Jones Newswires Column=20

(This column was originally published Wednesday.)=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- With the value of its stock continuing to plummet, E=
nron Corp. (ENE) tried to put on a good face Wednesday by issuing a press r=
elease touting, among other things, increased liquidity.
The problem is that most of the so-called news was three days old, recycled=
 from the company's latest quarterly filing.=20
And investors weren't fooled by the release. Although the stock of the emba=
ttled Houston energy trader regained some ground immediately after the rele=
ase, climbing to $5.35 a share from $4.60, it quickly gave up most of its g=
ains. One hour after the release, Enron stock was back trading at $4.98 a s=
hare, down more than 28% on the day.=20
"They had to say something, but really didn't have any new news. It's quite=
 incredible," said a Wall Street analyst covering Enron.=20
Amid mounting fears that Enron's credit woes could thwart its plan to merge=
 with rival Dynegy Inc. (DYN), a merger that many see as the only way for E=
nron to avoid possible bankruptcy, Enron began its press release by announc=
ing that "it has closed on the remaining $450 million of a previously annou=
nced $1 billion in secured credit lines..."=20
Great news, given the way Enron has been burning through cash. Except that =
investors who took time to read Enron's filing with the Securities and Exch=
ange Commission on Monday already knew that "on November 19, 2001, Enron cl=
osed a $450 million new secured line of credit, which will mature in the fo=
urth quarter of 2002." Readers of the company's 10-Q also knew that the $45=
0 million credit was secured by the assets of Enron's Northern Natural Gas =
Co.=20
Meanwhile, the real news everyone was waiting for, an announcement about wh=
ether a $690 million loan due next Tuesday had been extended, has yet to be=
 finalized.=20
Enron said in its release that it expected that an extension to mid-Decembe=
r would be formalized soon.=20
Separately, people familiar with the matter said J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. an=
d Citigroup Inc. continue to work with Enron to extend the maturity of the =
syndicated loan, which contains a clause that, unbeknownst to many, was tri=
ggered by Enron's ratings downgrade to "BBB-" by Standard & Poor's Corp. ea=
rlier this month. The clause stipulated that Enron would have to repay the =
$690 million note on November 27 if it didn't post collateral.=20
Those people said that the syndicated loan, which is built inside a structu=
red vehicle used to finance minority interests in power and energy sectors =
around the world, would likely be extended to the middle of 2002 when other=
 bank loans to Enron come due. About $1.75 billion of Enron's $3.5 billion =
in syndicated bank loans come due in May 2002 and will likely need to be re=
structured.=20
About $250 million of the assets securing the $690 million loan are in the =
process of being sold and will be used to pay down the loan, reducing the o=
utstanding portion of the loan that will need to be restructured, according=
 to the people familiar with the terms.=20
Meanwhile, Dynegy also tried to rally, although somewhat halfheartedly, inv=
estors around its plan to acquire Enron's stock. Dynegy said it was encoura=
ged by reports that Enron closed on its remaining $450 million credit facil=
ity and news of the extension of the $690 million loan. Under the terms of =
the acquisition, Enron holders would receive 0.2685 Dynegy share for each E=
nron share.=20
Investors, however, remain more circumspect, unmoved by the whopping 104% r=
isk premium currently attached to the merger. (That's how much investors bu=
ying Enron shares would make if the deal was closing Wednesday.)=20
Aside from continued worries about how much bad news may still come, analys=
ts and traders appear particularly concerned with Enron's liquidity, or lac=
k thereof, going forward.=20
"We're having a hard time believing that this new credit infusion (from the=
 banks), even with the $1.5 billion from Dynegy, will provide enough liquid=
ity for Enron," one risk arbitrageur at a New York hedge fund said.=20
As part of the merger agreement between Dynegy and Enron, Chevron Texaco, w=
hich owns 26% of Dynegy, already injected $1.5 billion into Enron. Another =
$1 billion is expected upon closing of the deal.=20

USA: Houston economy seen weathering major layoffs.
By Ellen Chang

11/23/2001
Reuters English News Service=20
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.=20

HOUSTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Houston's economy, buffered by a broad and dive=
rse tax base, should be able to weather thousands of layoffs from some of t=
he city's major corporations, including energy powerhouse Enron Corp., econ=
omists and analysts said.=20
Financially ailing Enron Corp. , which has 21,000 employees worldwide and i=
s in talks to be bought by Houston-based rival Dynegy Inc. , is the third m=
ajor employer in the city to announce severe financial problems in recent m=
onths. Analysts expect layoffs if the merger occurs.
Continental announced a layoff of 3,000 employees after the Sept. 11 attack=
s and Hewlett-Packard Co.'s plan to buy Compaq Computer Corp. will, if fina=
lized, result in 15,000 layoffs at the two companies. Compaq also announced=
 8,000 layoffs worldwide in July.=20
"It's fair to say that the potential layoffs at Enron and the layoffs at Co=
ntinental, taken alone, are negative factors, although probably small in th=
e grand scope of the Houston economy," said Phil Scheps, director of Housto=
n's finance and administration department.=20
Since last month when Enron became a target of a Securities and Exchange Co=
mmission investigation into financial dealings with partnerships, the energ=
y giant's market share has steadily eroded.=20
While neither Enron nor Dynegy have given any indication of the number of l=
ayoffs that could hit Houston, Barton Smith, director of the Institute for =
Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston, said the layoffs "will b=
e spread out over a long period of time and will not be excessive."=20
Robin Kapiloff, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service, said the city's ef=
forts to diversify its economy over the past decade will protect its revenu=
e collections, even as some of the city's biggest employers suffer. "We're =
watching to see where things go now," she said.=20
Alex Fraser, a director at Standard & Poor's, said the ratings agency isn't=
 concerned about Houston's credit position at this point. "While Enron is c=
ertainly a large player and prominent corporation, we're unclear on what th=
e impact would be."=20
While the fourth largest city in the country experienced a bit of a slowdow=
n since the Sept. 11 attacks, Houston has outperformed the rest of the nati=
on.=20
With a tax base of $87.3 billion in 2001, Houston is also buffered by the T=
exas Medical Center, the city's largest employer. Next year the city's tax =
base is estimated to grow to $95 billion.=20
Still, the national recession, energy price weakness in general, and the in=
itial loss of consumer confidence related to the attacks has caused the cit=
y to reduce its estimate of sales tax growth to 1.5 percent from 5 percent.=
 That revised estimate equals a $13 million reduction in the city's $1.4 bi=
llion budget.=20
But the city's property tax revenue has not been affected. Only a small cha=
nge in property tax collections is expected in 2002 because valuations are =
based on Jan. 1 data and for most of 2001, real estate growth was very larg=
e, Scheps said.=20
While recent economic indicators appear positive, and consumer confidence h=
as quickly rebounded, a better read on the strength of Houston's tax revenu=
e collections will be available in February when the city receives data for=
 the December holiday season, Scheps said.

Dynegy's Decision to Buy Enron Hits Crossroads Amid Rising Financial Woes

11/23/2001
Dow Jones Business News=20
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)=20

Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is=
 coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the mult=
ibillion-dollar deal, Friday's Wall Street Journal reported.=20
The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron (E=
NE) shares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-tradin=
g company, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas. Du=
ring the past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revi=
sed downward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billio=
n reduction in shareholder equity.
The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn=
erships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Secu=
rities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hu=
ndreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possib=
ility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t=
han $2 billion in loans by the end of the year.=20
As of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron =
shares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. =
In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the =
volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron's bonds also again traded sharpl=
y lower, market observers said.=20
The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy's stock, which also was among the most a=
ctively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dyne=
gy (DYN) shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each.=20
On Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executi=
ve Chuck Watson said his company was working "to accelerate the regulatory =
approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously=
 announced agreement" though it continued to perform "due diligence" on Enr=
on.=20
Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk=
 away from the deal if Enron's financial and legal problems become severe e=
nough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-=
called material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier th=
is year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to c=
omplete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark=
., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a=
 drop in IBP's earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit.=20
Dynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal,=
 two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders wou=
ld have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set.=20
One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enr=
on contained information Dynegy hadn't known about. Dynegy representatives =
planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i=
nformation as part of the company's due diligence, this person said. It cou=
ldn't be determined what the new information was.=20
The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685=
 share for each of Enron's roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving=
 the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy's current stock price. =
However, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to =
Dynegy.=20
On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $=
8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As =
of Wednesday, Enron's market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula=
 price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme=
nt, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra=
ding relatively close to the offering price.=20
Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. In=
itially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron =
and provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officia=
ls have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year,=
 would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy's earnings.=20
Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director=
 at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron's financial pro=
blems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than=
 Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said he thinks a "likely scenario"=
 is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15=
 Dynegy share for each Enron share.=20

For thousands of people burned by Enron Corp.'s spectacular implosion, it m=
ust have been tough to feel thankful yesterday.=20
Over the past month, the Houston-based company has admitted its earnings re=
ports going back four years are useless, written down billions in worthless=
 investments, and fired its chief financial officer in a failed bid to shor=
e up its plunging stock.
The slide in Enron's stock (ENE/NYSE) has already wiped out US$67-billion i=
n shareholder wealth. Now it may lose its last lifeline, a US$7.93-billion =
takeover offer from Dynegy Inc.=20
Enron's fall is proving to be more than just a cautionary tale about sketch=
y accounting. The case is raising serious questions about the responsibilit=
y of analysts who strongly recommended a stock that many now admit they nev=
er really understood.=20
"The public isn't going to trust stock analysts for awhile," said Scott Pre=
ston, a San Francisco-based analyst with Research Capital Corp. who does no=
t cover Enron. "Every analyst had a buy on the stock. And it's not like the=
re was only one little issue there. It's a mess and big brokerages were com=
ing out as it was on the way down saying put this thing in your Grandmother=
's [RRSP]."=20
But Wall Street's embarrassment pales next to the pain of shareholders, inc=
luding Enron employees whose pensions were loaded with the stock.=20
"I have lost my savings, my plans for the future, everything," Roy Rinard, =
a long-time Enron staffer, said this week as he announced that employees ha=
ve banded together for a class-action lawsuit against the company.=20
Several analysts have acknowledged that Enron's financial statements were r=
outinely incomprehensible. But with brokerages vying for the millions of do=
llars in equity and bond underwriting business Enron provided every year, m=
any analysts chose to focus on the company's growth, and failed to ask toug=
h questions about its books.=20
Critics say the red flags were waving long ago.=20
The first clear sign of trouble came Aug. 14, when Jeffrey Skilling quit th=
e CEO job he took over just seven months earlier, citing personal reasons. =
Former chief executive Kenneth Lay reclaimed the job. "Our business is stro=
ng and our growth prospects have never been better," Mr. Lay said at the ti=
me.=20
In fact, cracks were already appearing in the business. Enron's plan to sta=
rt trading capacity on fibre optic networks was a costly failure, and the c=
ompany was locked in a prolonged dispute with the Indian government over en=
ergy purchases in the region.=20
In October, Enron surprised investors by reporting its first quarterly loss=
 in more than four years, due in large part to the writedown of US$1-billio=
n in bad investments. Within a week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commi=
ssion started investigating Enron's finances.=20
The company soon admitted major accounting errors dating back to 1997. Its =
profits had been overstated by US$586-million, or 20%. The company revealed=
 that some of the investments it had written off were limited partnerships =
headed by CFO Andrew Fastow -- a serious breach of good corporate governanc=
e. Mr. Fastow was fired, but it didn't stop Enron's descent.=20
The pain may be far from over.=20
Facing a year of regulatory hearings to approve the merger, and a rapidly d=
evaluing asset in Enron, many fear Dynegy will walk away from the deal. If =
that happens, Enron may be doomed.=20
The stock closed Wednesday at US$5.01, down 93% this year. Dynegy closed at=
 US$39.76, valuing the Enron offer at US$10.67 a share. The fact that Enron=
's stock is trading so far below the offer price is a sure sign that invest=
ors doubt it will proceed, at least not at the current offer price.=20
All this has left investors wondering how so many could have been so wrong,=
 about so much. And how can so many continue to endorse the stock?=20
Of the 18 analysts that cover the stock, 10 still rate it a "buy." Goldman =
Sachs analyst David Fleisher removed Enron from his recommended list this w=
eek, but only after his firm was excluded from the banking syndicate arrang=
ing the Dynegy deal.=20
Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, dropped Enron from "buy" =
to "sell" this week, citing its long history of spotty disclosure, and ofte=
n evasive answers to questions. She acknowledged to clients that her downgr=
ade is "too little, too late" for many.

NEW YORK - Officials working to shore up Enron Corp.'s balance sheet said y=
esterday the struggling energy trader hoped to receive capital injections o=
f more than US$1.5-billion as early as next week.=20
Enron is in talks about investments of US$250-million with JP Morgan Chase =
and Citigroup and is also hoping to raise at least US$1-billion from privat=
e equity investors.
People close to Enron declined to comment on which buyout firms might wish =
to invest in Enron, but the Blackstone Group, which was reported to be talk=
ing to the company before Dynegy Inc. made its US$9-billion rescue bid, is =
understood not to be talking to Enron any longer.=20
Members of the 20-strong bank lending group, led by JP Morgan Chase and Cit=
igroup, are being asked to defer the maturities of their upcoming debt unti=
l after completion of the merger.=20
The move comes as reports from Goldman Sachs & Co. and Fitch, the credit ra=
ting agency, raised questions about the company's cash flow and its medium-=
term viability.=20
David Fleischer, a Goldman Sachs analyst, argued that cash balances were in=
adequate to meet US$2.8-billion of debt obligations falling due before the =
end of the year. People close to Enron say that nearly US$1-billion of that=
 debt has already been restructured.=20
The Fitch report said that if the Dynegy deal was not completed Enron would=
 struggle to meet US$9-billion of obligations, due before the end of next y=
ear.=20
People close to Enron insisted Dynegy remained committed to the merger and =
played down talk of renegotiation.=20
Dynegy would shortly issue a statement reasserting its commitment to the de=
al, they predicted.=20
But bankers acknowledged the fate of the Dynegy deal was largely irrelevant=
 in terms of the company's immediate liquidity problems.=20
The company has raised about US$7-billion in cash, enough to cover its oper=
ating costs since a US$1.2-billion writedown of shareholder equity plunged =
it into crisis on Oct. 16.=20
However, the company's cash flow is being squeezed. The computer screens in=
 front of energy traders at Enron's London headquarters still glow, even if=
 they are doing much less business following the U.S. group's financial woe=
s.=20
The Belgravia offices house Europe's biggest electricity trader, which acco=
unts for about a fifth of all European power contracts, worth roughly (ps)7=
0-billion ($158-billion) last year in British, Nordic and other European ma=
rkets.=20
Fears over Enron's credit rating have prompted a sharp fall in its European=
 electricity trading. Nonetheless, some companies that had previously withd=
rawn from buying and selling power with Enron have resumed trading with it =
in the short-term market.=20
Few want to risk trading further than a week or two ahead, however, given c=
ontinuing doubts over the company's finances.

Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is=
 coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the mult=
i-billion-dollar deal.=20
The pressure is coming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron shar=
es and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-trading compan=
y, the biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas in the U.S. In the p=
ast month, Enron has taken a $1 billion (1.1 billion euros) write-off of as=
sets, restated downward the past several years of earnings and taken a $1.2=
 billion reduction in shareholder equity. The problems owe largely to deali=
ngs Enron had with private partnerships run by some of its own executives n=
ow under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In d=
ocuments filed with the SEC on Monday, Enron disclosed hundreds of millions=
 of potential additional write-offs as well as the possibility that its wea=
kening financial condition could force it to repay more than $2 billion in =
loans by the end of the year.
On the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday, Enron shares were down 28% at $5.=
01 each, after having dropped some 23% on Tuesday. There was no trading Thu=
rsday. More than 115 million shares changed hands Wednesday, more than four=
 times the volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron's bonds also fell, tr=
aders said.=20
The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy's shares, which were also among the most=
 actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy shares were at $39.=
76 each on Wednesday, down $1.94.=20
Dynegy Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said his company was worki=
ng "to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger =
in accordance with the previously announced agreement" though it continued =
doing due diligence review on Enron. Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has=
 opportunities to renegotiate or walk away from the deal if Enron's financi=
al and legal problems become severe enough.=20
Dynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment. To consummate the dea=
l, two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders w=
ould have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set.=
=20
The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685=
 of its shares for each of Enron's roughly 850 million fully diluted shares=
, giving the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy's current stock=
 price.=20
However, from a price point of view, the deal is looking ever less attracti=
ve to Dynegy.=20
On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $=
8.63 a share, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. =
As of Wednesday, Enron's market price was only about 47% of the merger-form=
ula price.=20
Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announcement, when=
 the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins trading rel=
atively close to the offering price.=20
Sentiment among Wall Street analysts is also turning against the merger. In=
itially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron =
and provide a major boost to Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron executives have predi=
cted that the merger, which is supposed to be completed late next year, wou=
ld significantly and immediately increase Dynegy's earnings.=20
Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director=
 at UBS Warburg LLC, said that because of Enron's financial problems a comb=
ined company would actually have lower earnings next year than Dynegy would=
 have by itself. Mr. Barone said a "likely scenario" is that the merger for=
mula will be renegotiated sharply lower to about 0.15 Dynegy shares for eac=
h Enron share.=20
Such a move wouldn't be without precedent. According to a person familiar w=
ith the merger negotiations, Dynegy reduced the exchange formula at least o=
nce prior to the Nov. 9 announcement because of Enron's rapidly sinking sto=
ck price, which at the beginning of this year was above $80 a share.=20
In perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on Wall Street, Go=
ldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer lowered his ratings on Enron and Dynegy=
. A longtime Enron fan, Mr. Fleischer issued a report expressing doubts tha=
t the merger would help Dynegy's earnings and whether Enron could "recover =
the significant business that has been lost" in its energy trading operatio=
ns. "The Enron machine continues to sputter," wrote Mr. Fleischer.=20
Some observers say that if Dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to sig=
nificantly renegotiate the terms, Enron might be pushed into bankruptcy. Wi=
thout the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its bankers and cus=
tomers, an Enron request for bankruptcy protection from creditors "is highl=
y possible," said Ralph Pellecchia, a senior director at Fitch, a credit-ra=
tings agency. On Wednesday, Fitch maintained its credit rating on Enron at =
just one notch above noninvestment grade, or "junk" status. But Fitch also =
said that Enron's trading partners had made "significant cash collateral ca=
lls" in recent days that are "well in excess of previous expectations," con=
tributing to liquidity pressures.=20
Among the advisers Enron has hired during its current crisis is the law fir=
m of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which has a specialty in bankruptcy and corpor=
ate restructuring. One energy trader said Wednesday that some colleagues ha=
d even started a betting pool about the timing of a possible Enron bankrupt=
cy filing. But he quickly added that he had no knowledge that the company h=
as contemplated such a step.=20
Asked about a possible bankruptcy filing, an Enron spokeswoman said the com=
pany expects the Dynegy deal to go through and therefore doesn't expect to =
have to look at alternatives to the merger. Since the merger announcement, =
Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay has said that his company had alternatives to th=
e Dynegy deal, but he has declined to identify them.=20

Enron Europe carries on trading.

The screens in front of energy traders at Enron's London headquarters are s=
till glowing, even if they are doing much less business following the US gr=
oup's financial woes.=20
The Belgravia offices house Europe's biggest electricity trader, which acco=
unts for about a fifth of all European power contracts, worth roughly GBP70=
bn ($99bn) last year in UK, Nordic and other European markets.
Fears over Enron's credit rating have prompted a sharp fall in its European=
 electricity trading. Nonetheless, some companies which had previously with=
drawn from buying and selling power with Enron have resumed trading with it=
 in the short-term market.=20
Few want to risk trading further than a week or two ahead, however, given c=
ontinuing doubts over the company's finances. Whether Enron can survive dep=
ends on the commitment of Dynegy, the rival US energy group, to its $9bn re=
scue takeover announced two weeks ago.=20
John Sherriff, president and chief executive of Enron Europe, was anxious o=
n Thursday to show that it was still "business as usual" for his energy tra=
ders.=20
He estimates they are transacting about 70 per cent of the number of contra=
cts they would normally expect, but only about 40 per cent by volume. Rival=
 traders believe volumes may have fallen much further.=20
Contracts ranging from a day ahead to many years hence are used as a hedge =
to protect generators and retailers from risks of sudden price changes.=20
As financial instruments they are traded many times over. As a result, the =
total value of the transactions is much higher than the cost of the actual =
electricity delivered. However, the transactions play an increasingly impor=
tant role in oiling competitive electricity markets.=20
Rival European power companies and traders are anxious that Enron should no=
t fail.=20
Brian Senior, director of trading and asset management at Innogy, the UK ar=
m of the demerged National Power, said recent transactions had shown there =
was sufficient liquidity in European markets to cope if Enron disappeared.=
=20
Traders were more concerned that Enron might not be able to honour existing=
 long-term contracts. "This could have a domino effect, putting pressure on=
 other companies," said Mr Senior.=20
US power companies failed in similar circumstances after the Ohio-based Fed=
eral Energy defaulted on power contracts in 1998, he said.=20
Martin Stanley, president of European energy trading for TXU, another large=
 US energy group, said: "We are watching the situation carefully and would =
want to do nothing to add to Enron's problems by making unhelpful comments =
about their current position."=20
Mr Sherriff said: "Counter-parties are generally being very supportive."=20
Innogy said it had resumed limited trading with the US group but was "watch=
ing the situation carefully". TXU said: "We are still trading with Enron in=
 the short-term market but less than we were."=20
The Nordic market is one of the most active for power trading. US groups su=
ch as Enron, TXU and Dynegy have helped to expand the UK market, while Enro=
n has a strong base in Germany.=20

Enron Faces Suits by 401(k) Plan Participants
By Theo Francis and Ellen Schultz
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

11/23/2001
The Wall Street Journal=20
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)=20

Enron Corp., the embattled Houston energy and trading company, has been sue=
d by members of its employee-retirement plan, which has suffered losses bec=
ause of Enron's plummeting stock price.=20
Two separate lawsuits, filed in federal court in Houston, allege Enron misl=
ed participants in its 401(k) retirement plan about the risks of investing =
in the company's shares and note that the company forced the employees to r=
emain invested in its stock even as the shares fell. Amid growing disclosur=
es of financial problems in recent weeks, the company "locked down" the ret=
irement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19 to make administrative changes, which =
prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed.
Enron, which recently agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., Houston, becaus=
e of mounting financial problems, has seen its stock price fall to $5.01 on=
 Wednesday from a peak of nearly $90 a share last year. The decline has bee=
n costly to participants in Enron's retirement plan because more than 60% o=
f the 401(k) assets were invested in Enron shares at the end of last year, =
according to one of the suits.=20
The first suit was filed Nov. 13 on behalf of plan participants by Campbell=
 Harrison & Wright LLP, a Houston law firm, and the second was filed Tuesda=
y by Seattle-based Hagens Berman LLP. Both seek class-action certification.=
=20
Enron said its corporate policy is not to comment on pending lawsuits. A sp=
okeswoman also said the company's 401(k) plan offers participants 18 invest=
ment choices, one of which is company stock.=20
The company's stock has fallen amid mounting losses and disclosures that it=
 had extensive off-balance-sheet dealings with a web of partnerships headed=
 by former company officials. The Securities and Exchange Commission has la=
unched a formal investigation into the company's accounting, and Enron has =
said it will restate years of financial information.=20
The suits against Enron are the latest of a series of suits filed against c=
ompanies over losses in the company-stock portion of their 401(k) plans. Th=
e suits allege the plan trustees breached their fiduciary duties by continu=
ing to offer company stock, even after they became aware of serious busines=
s problems that would hurt the stock price. All the suits are pending.=20
As with most of these companies, Enron matches employee contributions to th=
e 401(k) with shares of Enron stock, and also offers Enron stock as an inve=
stment choice, in addition to a variety of mutual funds. About $1.3 billion=
 of the plan's $2.1 billion in assets was invested in Enron shares at the e=
nd of 2000, according to the suit filed by Campbell Harrison.=20
Pamela Tittle, a participant in the 401(k) plan who worked in the finance d=
epartment and a named plaintiff in the Enron suit filed by Campbell Harriso=
n & Wright, had roughly 2,000 shares of Enron stock in her retirement accou=
nt and has suffered losses of about $140,000 as a result of the stock's dec=
line. The suit alleges that the trustees of the Enron 401(k) plan violated =
their fiduciary duties by not informing plan participants that the company =
stock was in peril.=20
The suit filed by Hagens Berman, also alleges that the company failed to wa=
rn participants about risks of remaining invested in Enron stock. In additi=
on, it accuses Enron of systematically misrepresenting its financial result=
s since 1998 in connection with the partnerships under investigation by the=
 SEC.=20
Roy E. Rinard, a lineman for Enron in Oregon who is a named plaintiff in th=
e suit filed by Hagens Berman, has seen the value of his retirement plan fa=
ll to $70,000 from $470,000, largely as a result of the decline in Enron's =
stock. "I feel like I have been betrayed," Mr. Rinard said in press release=
 issued by his lawyers. "I lost my savings, my plans for the future, everyt=
hing."=20
Under federal pension law, companies are allowed to offer their own stock i=
n retirement plans, and are allowed to force employees to hold onto the sto=
ck. Enron doesn't let employees diversify out of shares they receive as mat=
ching contributions to the 401(k) plan until age 50.=20
However, plan trustees are supposed to operate the plan in the best interes=
ts of the participants, which includes choosing prudent investments. Genera=
lly, to prove that the plan's administrators breached their fiduciary dutie=
s, employees must show that the trustees knew the stock was a bad investmen=
t. This presents a high hurdle, so it is not surprising that prior lawsuits=
 over losses in company stock in 401(k) plans have generally come in the wa=
ke of allegations of accounting irregularities.=20
Lynn Sarko, one of Ms. Tittle's attorneys with Seattle's Keller Rohrback LL=
P, is also co-lead counsel in a similar lawsuit against Lucent Technologies=
 Inc., Murray Hill, N.J. Another firm representing Ms. Tittle is Dalton Got=
to Samson & Kilgard PLC, which is lead counsel in a similar suit against Ik=
on Office Solutions Inc., Malvern, Pa. The two law firms are representing M=
s. Tittle with Campbell Harrison & Wright.=20
The suits against Lucent and Ikon, like the suit against Enron, allege that=
 then-current plan trustees kept offering company stock in the plan despite=
 knowing of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price. Repr=
esentatives for Ikon and Lucent say their companies didn't require employee=
s to invest in the company stock, and educated employees about the need for=
 diversification.=20
The suit in which Mr. Rinard is plaintiff notes that on Oct. 17, a day afte=
r Enron announced the company was taking a nonrecurring charge totaling $1.=
01 billion in the third quarter, Enron "locked down" the 401(k) plan's asse=
ts, preventing participants from selling Enron shares. (A "lock-down" occur=
s when a retirement plan is transferred from one administrator to another, =
and generally lasts several weeks, during which time participants can't mak=
e changes in their investment choices).=20
The lock-down was lifted on Nov. 19. In the interim, on Nov. 8, Enron annou=
nced it would be forced to restate downward its reported financial results =
from 1997 through 2000. By the time the lock-down was lifted, as a result o=
f all the negative news the shares had fallen to below $9 a share from $32.=
20 on Oct. 17, when the lockup started, Hagens Berman attorney Karl Barth s=
aid.=20
"They were locked into it right when Enron knew it was going to be announci=
ng some really bad news," Mr. Barth said. "Mr. Rinard's looking at having n=
o retirement savings now. It's a horrible thing to have to start over in yo=
ur 50s."

Enron says sorry as shares keep falling.

Investors in Enron must be wondering when their luck will change. The compa=
ny's shares were sent tumbling again this week after the company revealed t=
hat its credit crunch was worse than many investors thought. The news spurr=
ed talk that rival energy trader Dynegy may have to inject more cash under =
its plan to buy Enron - or could even walk away from the deal.=20
In a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Enron sa=
id it must pay down a $690 million note by Nov. 27 because of the recent do=
wngrade of its credit rating. Unless Enron repays the note or posts a lette=
r of credit, the unidentified creditor can start liquidating Enron assets. =
These include CEG Rio, a gas distribution company in Brazil that Enron is a=
lready in the process of selling to pay down other debt.
At the market close on Tuesday, Enron shares stood at $6.99/share, about 39=
% below Dynegy's bid price of $11.60/share, and a fraction of the $90.75 pe=
ak reached in August 2000 when the company was in its asset-light pomp.=20
At least Enron is trying to say sorry - sort of. In a conference call with =
analysts and investors last week, chairman and chief executive Kenneth Lay =
indicated regret for the series of bad investments in non-core businesses t=
hat has nearly bankrupted the big energy trading company. "In hindsight, we=
 made some very bad investments in some non-core businesses," Lay acknowled=
ged. "I could not have ever contemplated the events we as a company and you=
 as a stakeholder have faced over the last several weeks. This has resulted=
 in a complete loss of investor confidence."=20
And, via the Dynegy deal, a complete loss of Enron independence, although e=
ven that is not cut and dried. If Enron fails to settle the $690 million de=
bt repayment next week, its credit rating would likely be reduced to sub-in=
vestment or "junk" status. And if that happened, it would qualify as a "mat=
erial adverse change," allowing Dynegy to pull out of the merger if it want=
ed to. Analysts doubt things will get this bad, still giving the deal a 70-=
90% chance of going through.

Business/Financial Desk; Section C
>From Sunbeam to Enron, Andersen's Reputation Suffers
By FLOYD NORRIS

11/23/2001
The New York Times=20
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company=20

THIS has been the worst year ever for Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm =
that once deserved the title of conscience of the industry. The Securities =
and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud complaints against the Andersen p=
artner who audited Sunbeam and against the firm itself in the Waste Managem=
ent case.=20
Now Enron has repudiated the financial statements that were certified by Ar=
thur Andersen, in the process shaving more than half a billion dollars from=
 the company's reported profits in recent years.
All of which raises the question: Has Arthur Andersen become the black shee=
p of the accounting industry?=20
It is not an easy question to answer, and not everyone is willing to rush t=
o judgment. ''If you want to attack Andersen for Enron, you need to know mo=
re than we know,'' Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and=
 Exchange Commission, said this week.=20
But if there is a thread connecting what is known about the three cases, it=
 is materiality. In all three cases, Andersen auditors spotted bad accounti=
ng but were persuaded it was immaterial and therefore allowed it to go ahea=
d.=20
Materiality is one of those flexible concepts that can get accountants into=
 trouble. The idea is that it doesn't much matter if a few little things we=
re gotten wrong. But they can add up.=20
At Enron, however, they did not add up to that much -- a total of $93 milli=
on over four years. The biggest restatement of Enron profits concerns a rel=
ated party that Enron now says should have been consolidated. It is not cle=
ar if Andersen had the facts needed to make that decision at the time.=20
To those who treasure the role of auditors, the humiliation of Andersen is =
painful. Back in the 1950's, it was Leonard Spacek, Andersen's managing par=
tner, who warned that ''the profession's existence is in peril'' because it=
 was not showing enough independence. His public prodding was crucial in ma=
king the industry do a better job. Two decades ago, when the issue on the t=
able was pension accounting, Andersen was the only major accounting firm to=
 break with clients and push for good rules.=20
Now Andersen's backbone is open to question. It was evidence that senior pe=
ople at Andersen repeatedly gave in to pressure from Waste Management that =
led the S.E.C. to bring that suit, which the firm chose to settle without a=
dmitting it had done anything wrong. The partner that the S.E.C. says looke=
d the other way at Sunbeam is fighting the accusations, and Andersen says h=
e acted properly.=20
Lynn Turner, who was chief accountant of the S.E.C. at the time and is now =
director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State Un=
iversity, says what is happening to Andersen now is reminiscent of what hap=
pened to Coopers & Lybrand when he was a partner there and the firm had a s=
eries of highly publicized blown audits.=20
''We got bludgeoned to death in the press,'' he said. ''People did not even=
 want to see us at their doorsteps. It was brutal, but we deserved it. We h=
ad gotten into this mentality in the firm of making business judgment calls=
.'' By that he meant that the firm paid too much attention to not offending=
 clients and not enough to good accounting.=20
For Andersen to avoid that fate, its relatively new chief executive, Joseph=
 Berardino, who declined to be interviewed for this column, will need to se=
t a tone inside the firm making clear that he expects auditors to show the =
backbone that Mr. Spacek epitomized. And then he will have to convince the =
public of that.

Dynegy Deal To Buy Enron Hits Crossroads
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

11/23/2001
The Wall Street Journal=20

Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is=
 coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the mult=
ibillion-dollar deal.=20
The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron sh=
ares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-trading comp=
any, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas. During t=
he past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revised do=
wnward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billion redu=
ction in shareholder equity.
The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn=
erships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Secu=
rities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hu=
ndreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possib=
ility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t=
han $2 billion in loans by the end of the year.=20
As of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron =
shares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. =
In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the =
volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron's bonds also again traded sharpl=
y lower, market observers said.=20
The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy's stock, which also was among the most a=
ctively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dyne=
gy shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each.=20
On Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executi=
ve Chuck Watson said his company was working "to accelerate the regulatory =
approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously=
 announced agreement" though it continued to perform "due diligence" on Enr=
on.=20
Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk=
 away from the deal if Enron's financial and legal problems become severe e=
nough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-=
called material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier th=
is year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to c=
omplete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark=
., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a=
 drop in IBP's earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit.=20
Dynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal,=
 two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders wou=
ld have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set.=20
One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enr=
on contained information Dynegy hadn't known about. Dynegy representatives =
planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i=
nformation as part of the company's due diligence, this person said. It cou=
ldn't be determined what the new information was.=20
The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685=
 share for each of Enron's roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving=
 the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy's current stock price. =
However, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to =
Dynegy.=20
On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $=
8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As =
of Wednesday, Enron's market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula=
 price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme=
nt, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra=
ding relatively close to the offering price.=20
Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. In=
itially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron =
and provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officia=
ls have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year,=
 would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy's earnings.=20
Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director=
 at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron's financial pro=
blems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than=
 Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said he thinks a "likely scenario"=
 is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15=
 Dynegy share for each Enron share.=20
Such a ratcheting down wouldn't be without precedent in the deal. According=
 to one person familiar with the merger negotiations, Dynegy reduced the ex=
change formula at least once prior to the Nov. 9 announcement because of En=
ron's rapidly sinking stock price, which at the beginning of this year was =
above $80 a share.=20
In perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on Wall Street, Go=
ldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer lowered his ratings on Enron and Dynegy=
. A longtime Enron fan, Mr. Fleischer issued a report expressing doubts tha=
t the merger would help Dynegy's earnings and whether Enron could "recover =
the significant business that has been lost" in its giant energy-trading op=
erations. "The Enron machine continues to sputter," Mr. Fleischer wrote.=20
Some observers say that if Dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to ren=
egotiate the terms significantly, Enron might be pushed into a bankruptcy-l=
aw filing. Without the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its ba=
nkers and customers, an Enron bankruptcy-court filing "is highly possible,"=
 said Ralph Pellecchia, a senior director at Fitch, a credit-ratings agency=
. On Wednesday, Fitch maintained its credit rating on Enron at just one not=
ch above noninvestment-grade, or "junk," status. But Fitch also said it bel=
ieved Enron's trading partners had made "significant cash collateral calls"=
 in recent days that are "well in excess of previous expectations," contrib=
uting to "liquidity pressures."=20
Among the advisers Enron has hired during its current crisis is the law fir=
m of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which specializes in bankruptcy and corporate-=
workout situations. Asked about a possible bankruptcy filing, an Enron spok=
eswoman said the company expects the Dynegy deal to go through and therefor=
e doesn't expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger. Since the m=
erger announcement, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay has said his company had alt=
ernatives to the Dynegy deal but he has declined to identify them. Enron sa=
id it made some progress improving its financial position. The company said=
 it reached a final agreement with units of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Cit=
igroup Inc. on the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1 bill=
ion in secured credit lines. Enron said lenders had agreed to extend repaym=
ent of an existing $690 million note to mid-December from next week. The sp=
okeswoman said a restructuring of that obligation is expected to be complet=
ed next month so that repayment wouldn't be required this year.=20

Premiums Stay High on Enron's Near Options, And `Doubling Up' Date Looms fo=

NEW YORK -- Volatility and premiums on Enron's near-month options remain ex=
tremely high. It is a sign that investors are willing to pay a rich price f=
or option protection and expect the stock to be unsettled as the Houston co=
mpany sorts through its credit and debt problems and seeks to calm frazzled=
 investors.=20
Enron near-month defensive puts traded heavily in an otherwise quiet sessio=
n Wednesday, as investors bought them to hedge. The December 5 puts traded =
more than 10,000 contracts and jumped 45 cents to $1.10 at the Chicago Boar=
d Options Exchange. The stock closed down $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01, as of 4 =
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Enron's calls traded actively as some investors sold them to generate incom=
e. Traders noted some call buying -- especially after Enron procured a thre=
e-week extension on a $690 million note -- as some hopeful investors bet on=
 Enron pulling through its troubles and proceeding with its merger with Dyn=
egy Inc. Enron's December 5 calls traded more than 14,500 contracts, compar=
ed with open interest of 710, as they fell $1.45 to $1.15 at the CBOE.=20
For investors who want to book a tax loss on beaten-down stocks, the "wash =
sale" rule can be a hurdle, because it essentially prevents taxpayers from =
selling stock or securities at a loss and then reacquiring "substantially i=
dentical" securities within a 30-day period before or after that loss. This=
 poses a problem for those who want to book a loss yet own stocks whose pri=
ces now make them attractive "buy" candidates.=20
In addition, the Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that the w=
ash-sale rule will disallow a loss if the investor sells an in-the-money pu=
t, because there is a strong likelihood that stock will be put to or acquir=
ed by the investor.=20
So investors typically get around the wash-sale rule by "doubling up": buyi=
ng additional stock or options, waiting at least 31 days, and then selling =
the original stock to book the loss. Investors double up by buying calls, w=
hich locks a price to buy stock and achieves the same effect as buying addi=
tional stock.

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- The foreign-owned 85% stake in India's $2.9 billion=
 Dabhol Power Co. may be sold for under $700 million, a senior Indian gover=
nment source told Dow Jones Newswires Thursday.=20
"The two prospective buyers for Dabhol's foreign equity, BSES Ltd. (P.BSX) =
and Tata Power Co. (P.TPW) have currently suggested a price which is below =
$500 million. During the final purchase negotiations, their take-it-or-leav=
e-it offer may go up to as high as around $700 million," said the official.
U.S. energy company Enron Corp. (ENE) owns a controlling 65% stake in the 2=
,184-megawatt Dabhol power project, located in the western Indian state of =
Maharashtra.=20
Enron wants to sell its stake because of payment defaults by its sole custo=

JAPAN: Shock waves from Enron crisis felt in Japan.

11/22/2001
Reuters English News Service=20
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.=20

TOKYO, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The shock waves from the crisis at Enron Corp are=
 being felt in Japan, where the stressed energy group has about 60 billion =
yen ($486.9 million) of bonds outstanding, money market dealers said on Thu=
rsday.=20
Dealers said most of Enron's yen-denominated bonds are believed to be held =
by Japanese investors.
In the U.S. bond market, Enron's 6.4 percent dollar-denominated notes matur=
ing in 2006 were selling at a deep discount of 62 cents on the dollar on We=
dnesday.=20
The price of Enron's yen bonds are also under pressure, but because the Jap=
anese market is far less liquid than the U.S. market it is virtually imposs=
ible to quote a price.=20
"Even if you want to sell them, there's no one is out there to buy," said a=
 market source, who declined to be identified.=20
Some investors holding Enron's bonds put on brave face.=20
"Enron's core business is still doing fairly good. And we have bonds due ne=
xt May. So we have concluded that there won't be grave concerns for its red=
emption," said Yasushi Inoue, manager at UFJ Partners Asset Management.=20
Some in the market are concerned, however, that some money management funds=
 (MMFs) have Enron bonds in their portfolio.=20
MMFs, seen as an alternative to bank deposits, generally invest in safe ass=
ets in order to secure stable fixed income.=20
But because the Bank of Japan has been guiding short-term rates to near zer=
o since last March, some funds are allocating money to riskier bonds, or co=
mmercial paper, to raise returns.=20
Five MMFs run by four asset management companies hold Enron bonds totaling =
about 38.5 billion yen nominal value.=20
DEFAULT WORRY=20
Should Enron default on the yen bonds, the price of those MMFs would fall b=
elow their purchase price, meaning some funds would be unable to fully pay =
back the money entrusted to them.=20
Although MMFs technically do not guarantee principle, they are widely regar=
ded be almost as safe as deposits.=20
"If the MMF prices fall below purchase price, investors may lose confidence=
 in MMFs, which could trigger an exodus of funds out of MMFs," said the mar=
ket source.=20
That would force fund managers of MMFs to sell a large part of assets in th=
eir funds, which could in turn push up short-term interest rates.=20
"I could not rule out such possibility," said the source.=20
Separately on Thursday, Enron said it was reviewing operations in Japan, in=
cluding an option to sell the business to a third party.=20
"Enron Corp is reviewing its operations in Japan ... considering every poss=
ibility including retaining the operations or selling a part of it," a spok=
eswoman in Tokyo said.=20
The company will likely finalise its plans within five or six weeks, she sa=
id.=20
Enron gained its first foothold in Japan in 1999, when it established affil=
iate E Power Corp, hoping to benefit from Japan's deregulation of the retai=
l power market.=20
In April last year, it set up Enron Japan Corp, which has so far introduced=
 electricity trading and marketing and other financial instruments. The com=
pany has 70 employees in Japan.=20
Shares of Enron closed down 28.33 percent at $5.01 on the New York Stock Ex=
change on Wednesday. ($1=3D123.22 yen).

Asia Energy Watch:PlattsDirect To Launch In Rough Waters
By Jeremy Bowden

11/22/2001
Dow Jones International News=20
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)=20

A DOW JONES NEWSWIRES COLUMN=20

SINGAPORE -(Dow Jones)- Credit concerns at Enron Online and repeated delays=
 to the launch of eNymex have dramatically altered the outlook for online e=
nergy trading over recent months.
The big-oil backed Internet site, Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, has so=
 far been the main beneficiary of its competitors' problems, with recent tr=
ade volumes jumping sharply. But its growing hegemony may soon be challenge=
d by a very different online trading system, run by Platts, a unit of publi=
sher McGraw-Hill Cos. (MHP).=20
Aware of sensitivity to its role in oil markets from within the industry, P=
latts is approaching electronic trading with a very different business mode=
l from existing commission-based sites.=20
Platts sources say its new system, dubbed PlattsDirect, is designed - initi=
ally at least - as a "communication device" to enhance its existing role of=
 assessing and publishing benchmark energy prices. Its current telephone-ba=
sed systems, they say, can't cope with rising liquidity, all of which must =
be factored in when making its price assessments.=20
They hope PlattsDirect will develop as a "master exchange," providing a "ne=
utral base" for other exchanges to feed pricing information, in order to co=
mpliment Platts leading role as price benchmark assessor and publisher.=20
PlattsDirect is more likely to charge a subscription fee than commissions, =
sources said, although a final decision has yet to be made. Unlike some oth=
er systems, PlattsDirect will offer no clearing or counterparty service.=20
While a launch date hasn't been fixed, Platts hopes PlattsDirect will be up=
 and running in early 2002. Nymex by contrast, is without a launch date for=
 its eNymex Internet system, which has suffered repeated delays since its o=
riginal launch date of October 2000.=20
Is Nymex Leaving It Too Late?=20

Some oil traders suggest Nymex has "missed the boat" in its efforts to deve=
lop electronic trading, bogged down by its desire to keep local floor trade=
rs happy.=20
In September, Nymex President J. Robert Collins said the launch of eNymex h=
ad been delayed by factors including the bankruptcy of one of the system's =
developers, Globalview Software Inc., according to industry publications Oi=
l and Gas Journal and Petroleum Intelligence Weekly.=20
But several months later, Globalview continues to be alive and well, despit=
e legal action taken against it by Nymex, and has posted a 25% increase in =
sales so far this year. A senior Globalview official said his company is co=
untersuing, without providing further details.=20
ICE invited Nymex to join it last year, but Nymex rejected the offer, prefe=
rring to focus on its own electronic system. In June, ICE acquired London's=
 International Petroleum Exchange, which plans to scrap floor trading and a=
dopt electronic trading for all its products.=20
Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Enron Online faces even more serious problems than Nyme=
x. Oil trading sources say it has seen a sharp reduction in trade volume ov=
er recent weeks as counterparties grow increasingly wary over the company's=
 financial position. The system Enron designed to reduce credit risk - wher=
e Enron itself acts as a counterparty to every online trade - appears to ha=
ve backfired.=20
Even if the system is successfully transferred to Dynegy Inc. (DYN) - which=
 has agreed to take over Enron, pending legal objections - trading sources =
say counterparties are likely to be wary of placing so much risk with a sin=
gle company again, leaving the Enron Online trading model at a disadvantage=
.=20
They added that unless the Dynegy takeover is quick, Enron Online liquidity=
 could dry up completely. Enron itself has warned that reduced trading acti=
vity will hit fourth-quarter earnings.=20
Platts' Independence, Physical Trade Advantageous=20

While it doesn't appear keen to compete with other systems head-on initiall=
y, PlattsDirect has several advantages which could persuade traders to use =
its system. A possible absence of commissions is of concern to Singapore br=
okers and probably other online sites too.=20
Platts sources claim the site's independence and resulting objectivity is a=
lso a major advantage over other sites. But the concern for Platts is that =
that very independence also means it has no guaranteed support from within =
the trading community.=20
ICE, by contrast, was developed and is owned by a selection of companies in=
volved in the trading of oil, including oil majors BP PLC (BP), Total Fina =
Elf SA (TOT) and Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD), and enjoys IPE support.=20
PlattsDirect is also able to offer physical trade - unique so far among on-=
line energy trading sites. Some traders say Platts' existing role as a publ=
isher of benchmark oil price assessments - particularly in Asia - is bound =
to attract trade to the new system.=20
"Some companies will want to trade on PlattsDirect because prices from the =
system will be used when assessing benchmarks," said one trader. The majori=
ty of physical oil trade is priced against benchmarks rather than on a spot=
 basis, and most over-the-counter derivative products are also settled agai=
nst Platts' benchmark assessments - including Nymex Brent and many on ICE.=
=20
Platts claims physical and derivative products worth US$10 billion are trad=
ed against its benchmark quotes everyday, and this makes influencing those =
quotes a priority for traders.=20
Platts also plans to use the prices of oil derivative trades from PlattsDir=
ect to improve the accuracy of its daily assessments of forward prices.=20

HOUSTON (AP) - Shares of embattled Enron Corp. continued their rapid declin=
e as analysts and investors expressed more doubt that the once-mighty energ=
y trader could recover lost business and investor confidence.=20
Analysts are questioning whether Dynegy Inc.'s planned dlrs 8.9 billion acq=
uisition of Enron will survive.
Enron shares fell 23 percent Tuesday, then slid another 28 percent Wednesda=
y, to close down dlrs 1.98 at dlrs 5.01 on the New York Stock Exchange.=20
Shares of Dynegy fell dlrs 1.94 to dlrs 39.76 on the NYSE.=20
In a report issued Wednesday morning, Goldman Sachs & Co. analyst David Fle=
ischer became the latest to question Enron's future, saying a Securities an=
d Exchange Commission filing by the Houston-based company earlier this week=
 "raised new issues about liquidity and the ability of the company to even =
finance itself over the next several months."=20
Documents that Enron filed with the SEC late Monday restated the company's =
third-quarter earnings and said the company may have to repay a dlrs 690 mi=
llion debt by next week because of its decreased credit ratings.=20
Fleischer said Enron's Nov. 16 cash balance of dlrs 1.2 billion is inadequa=
te to meet remaining debt obligations.=20
Fleischer acknowledged, however, Enron's efforts to renegotiate next week's=
 due date for the dlrs 690 million debt. He said there were indications tha=
t Enron's banks may be willing to restructure the debt.=20
Michelle Foss, director of the Energy Institute at the University of Housto=
n, said this latest round of troubles had to raise concerns about whether t=
he Dynegy-Enron deal will be pulled off.=20
"It doesn't look like it's going to be able to happen," Foss said. "It did =
look like a decent idea when they proposed the merger, but today I'm sure t=
hey'll look at it and see if they can salvage their attempt to buy Enron."=
=20
Representatives of Enron and Dynegy did not immediately return telephone ca=
lls for comment Wednesday.=20
Enron agreed to be bought after its stock price plunged about 80 percent in=
 the weeks after disclosing a dlrs 1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equ=
ity related to partnerships run by company officers. The arrangements allow=
ed Enron to keep about half a billion dollars in debt off its books.=20
Those partnerships are being investigated by the SEC.=20
Earlier this month, Enron said it overstated earnings from 1997 through the=
 first half of 2001 by dlrs 586 million and revised its debt upward by dlrs=
 628 million.=20

Investors were increasingly worried last night that rival Dynegy's $8.9 bil=

Enron, which has admitted to huge accounting errors amid a Securities and E=

IT'S BEEN FOREVER long since a juicy accounting scandal hit the business pr=
ess, so a big hearty thanks to Enron Corp. of Houston for making up for los=
t time.=20
Who knew that the largest energy company in the United States - one of the =
biggest in the world, in fact - would suddenly be keeping company with such=
 disgraceful accounting debacles as Waste Management Inc., the garbage-haul=
ing company that overstated earnings by $1.43 billion (U.S.), Safety-Kleen =
Corp. ($534 million), Sunbeam Corp., Cendant Corp., and, lest we forget, Bo=
ston Chicken Inc., which made a tasty bucket-of-cluck but kept losses off i=
ts balance sheet until it went bankrupt and shareholders were wiped out.
Back to Enron. In the past decade and a half, the company, under the leader=
ship of Kenneth Lay, was remade from an uninspiring regional pipeline calle=
d Houston Natural Gas into what Lay called an "energy store" branded with a=
 jazzy name. Enron and its CEO drew much laudatory press for virtually crea=
ting wholesale markets for electricity and natural gas just when deregulati=
on allowed for open market competition. Moving into online energy trading w=
as inspired - the company laid claim to being the world's largest e-commerc=
e concern. One-stop shopping for all your energy needs! Revenues were enorm=
ous. Profits nudged $1 billion. Its place in the business firmament was sec=
ured when the Houston Astros' quarter-billion-dollar retractable roof ballp=
ark was named Enron Field.=20
Now we know that the transformation was more magical than anyone imagined.=
=20
The first clue was the company's announcement that it was restating earning=
s going back four years plus a few quarters. Call it five years. Now that j=
ust might be a record.=20
It's never good news when a company says it will be rethinking its profit n=
umbers. They never seem to go up as a result. Sure enough, in the case of E=
nron approximately $590 million was erased from the earnings line starting =
in '97, when the company should have netted $96 million less than it previo=
usly claimed, through to last year, in which it should have taken a $132 mi=
llion haircut to its earnings.=20
For Enron, it has been a long, if swift, fall for a firm once voted by Fort=
une magazine as more innovative than either Intel Corp. or Microsoft Corp. =
The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating. The stock once tra=
ded at $80. It closed yesterday at $5.01 on the New York Stock Exchange.=20
This week, a former accountant with the SEC pronounced that the Enron disas=
ter, added to the accounting messes that have gone before, make for investo=
r losses to rival the savings and loan fiasco. The company's debt rating is=
 barely investment grade and its survival strategy - delivering itself to a=
 takeover by the much smaller Dynegy Inc. - is in jeopardy. In a securities=
 filing Monday, Enron said that a ratings downgrade will force it to meet a=
 debt obligation of $690 million before month's end, an obligation that it =
may not be able to meet. Yesterday the company said it had bought some brea=
thing room on that debt, to mid-December. Any more "ratings events," that i=
s, another downgrade, will cause the company to "repay, refinance or cash c=
ollateralize" another $3.9 billion. Short story: the company's unravelling.=
=20
Did it have to come to this? Judging from the off-balance sheet shenanigans=
 at the company, the answer to that question is a clear yes. We need only c=
onsider the moment in 1999 when Enron's board endorsed a move by none other=
 than its own chief financial officer to head up a couple of wholly-owned s=
ubsidiaries that would do business with the principal company. The results =
of the subsidiaries would not be consolidated on Enron's balance sheet. A s=
prinkling of insiders constituted the review and approval team that would o=
versee the transactions.=20
Andrew Fastow was the lucky CFO. Lucky is an apt description, as Enron has =
now disclosed that Fastow earned more than $30 million from a host of manag=
ement and investment activities through both the subsidiaries and related p=
artnerships called JEDI and Chewco. (Yes, they were named in honour of the =
Star Wars movies.)=20
Enron always had a reputation for being fast and entrepreneurial. Investors=
 just never knew how fast and entrepreneurial the company was. Fastow was p=
ushed out the door three weeks ago. The company's treasurer and its general=
 counsel were fired. Both had participated in a limited partnership that ha=
d purchased interests in affiliated subsidiaries of the Fastow subsidiaries=
. It's as simple as that.=20
Some of the Fastow transactions, involving investments in power projects fr=
om Poland to Brazil or call options on gas turbines, are as clear as mud. O=
thers are more transparent. Example: in December, 1999, Enron sold an equit=
y investment in Enron Nigeria Barge Ltd., providing "seller financing" to t=
he purchasing investment bank. Seven months later, LJM2, one of the Fastow-=
managed subsidiaries, purchased the investment and assumed the seller-finan=
ced note from Enron. When LJM2 subsequently sold the investment it repaid t=
he Enron note and pocketed a $700,000 profit.=20
There are plenty of conflict of interest examples. Plus numerous losses tha=
t should have accrued to Enron as a result of the subsidiaries' activities,=
 losses that the company thought it would rather not recognize.=20
Chastened, Enron has established a special committee to study all such tran=
sactions. It won't help investor confidence that the investigation may iden=
tify even more bad news. It's doubtful that the proposed merger with Dynegy=
 can take place any more.=20
JP Morgan Chase and Salomon Smith Barney, which have acted as advisers to E=
nron on the merger, have financed $1 billion in loan assistance to help the=
 company through the critical period ahead. An analyst at Goldman Sachs cal=
led it "another win for the bank/broker model." Here's a different way to l=
ook at it: Morgan and Citigroup, Salomon's parent, share a wide range of ex=
posures within the Enron empire and are desperate to see the deal done.=20
If the merger fails, Enron will have to pay a $297.5 million breakup fee to=
 Dynegy and a further $52.5 to ChevronTexaco Corp., which has 26 per cent o=
f Dynegy.=20
Investors can't see a win anywhere in the story. Their stock is in the base=
ment. Multiple class-action suits have been launched, citing fraud, materia=
l misrepresentation, breach of duty of disclosure, unjust enrichment. A sep=
arate lawsuit aims to enjoin the merger.=20
And what of Enron's auditors? On Monday, Michigan Democratic Representative=
 John Dingell called for an investigation into Arthur Andersen LLP for the =
work it did for both the energy company and, years ago, for Waste Managemen=
t. (In July, without admitting or denying any fraud allegations in the Wast=
e Management affair, the Big Five accounting firm paid a $7 million fine to=
 the SEC.)=20
The Public Oversight Board, which oversees the accounting profession in the=
 United States, now says that any scrutiny of Andersen's work is a job for =
the SEC. The numbers mess will predictably spur more criticism of the role =
of the auditor and an examination of how impartial any auditor can hope to =
be when it's being paid both for accounting work and for consulting service=
s, as Andersen was. Did Andersen ever argue for more conservative accountin=
g? Or how about this: how is it that all these "special purpose entities" -=
 JEDI, etc. - were kept off the balance sheet when they did not qualify for=
 non-consolidation treatment? Isn't the auditor supposed to know that?=20
For the moment, Kenneth Lay is wearing the most laundry. It was on Lay's wa=
tch that the web of off-balance sheet business was established. The Missour=
i-born son of a Baptist minister retired in February, then stepped back int=
o the job in August when his replacement announced he was leaving for perso=
nal reasons, something to do with a new marriage and a big house being buil=
t. "There's nothing to disclose," said Jeffrey Skilling on his way out the =
door. "The company's in great shape."=20
The company is in dreadful shape. The news gets worse with every passing mi=
nute.

HOUSTON - Enron Corp. said yesterday it secured the remaining US$450-millio=
n of a new US$1-billion credit line, but the news did little to reassure in=
vestors it can stay afloat long enough to complete its merger with rival Dy=
negy Inc.=20
Shares of the Houston-based energy giant were off 26%, despite the announce=
ment in which Enron also said it had pushed back the deadline for repaying =
a US$690-million debt to mid-December from a deadline of next Tuesday.
Enron's shares fell 23% on Tuesday after it raised credit concerns in a fil=
ing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
"The Dynegy deal will take a long time and a lot of things could happen ove=
r that time period," said Michael Barbis, a Fulcrum Global Partners analyst=
. "Dynegy did their homework, but if they missed anything, they have a numb=
er of exit opportunities."=20
In yesterday's statement, Enron said it is in feverish talks with its other=
 lenders to restructure its debt obligations and reaffirmed its commitment =
to the Dynegy deal, tagged at US$9-billion in stock.=20
"We continue to believe that this merger is in the best interests of our sh=
areholders, employees, and lenders," said Ken Lay, Enron's chairman and chi=
ef executive.=20
Enron was the most actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange for=
 the second day in a row.=20
Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive, said he is encouraged =
by the new US$450-million loan and the debt extension for the US$690-millio=
n.=20
"We are continuing our confirmatory due diligence and working to accelerate=
 the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance wit=
h the previously announced agreement," he said.=20
Mr. Watson said ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26% of Dynegy, reiterated i=
ts "full confidence in Dynegy's disciplined management approach to complete=
 the merger and to build a new company into an industry leader."=20
Privately, analysts were calling the odds of a successful merger lower in t=
he wake of new negative news made in a U.S. Securities and Exchange filing.=
 Most analysts called the chances of success even, whereas most had called =
the odds of success at 60% to 70% earlier.=20
Wall Street analysts said Enron is losing market share because of credit co=
ncerns by its trading partners and questions over Dynegy's takeover offer.=
=20
"Enron is definitely losing market share on credit concerns. Cash needs to =
run the business have now increased. The market perceives Enron as needing =
more cash," said Mr. Barbis.=20
Goldman Sachs & Co. downgraded Enron and Dynegy to "market perform" on Tues=
day, and took both off its recommended list. It said the cash infusion from=
 Dynegy -- US$1.5-billion -- "appears inadequate to restore the confidence =
of Enron customers."=20
The bad news in Monday's filing with the SEC included the acceleration of t=
he US$690-million debt because of a credit downgrade on Nov. 12, a new redu=
ction in third-quarter earnings, word that Enron has only about US$1.5-bill=
ion cash on hand after new infusions of US$5.5-billion over the past few we=
eks and an admission that trading volumes had dropped.=20
The trading business, Enron's crown jewel and the part most coveted by Dyne=
gy, relies on volume for profitability, and Enron said it was possible the =
lower volumes would hamper fourth-quarter earnings.=20
Its trading partners, now more publicly than before, on Tuesday said they w=
ere treading carefully.=20
"We've been scaling back for some time, but we're still dealing with Enron.=
 Everyday, our credit people are watching," said Al Butkus, a vice-presiden=
t with Kansas City-based Utilicorp United.=20
Cinergy, a Cincinnati-based energy firm, said through a spokesman that it c=
ontinued to trade with Enron but was keeping a close eye on its health.=20
An indicator of Enron's shape was the fact its bonds are being quoted by pr=
ice, like junk bonds, rather than how much extra yield they carry over U.S.=
 Treasuries, like investment-grade bonds.

CALGARY -- Enron Corp. won some financial breathing room yesterday, but its=
 shares plunged as much as a third before recovering slightly over continui=
ng fears that a deal to rescue the once-mighty U.S. energy trader could be =
in jeopardy.=20
Shares in the beleaguered Houston company sank at one point to $4.55 (U.S.)=
 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. For the second successive day, =
investors were beating up the company over news Monday that $690-million in=
 debt is rapidly coming due as a result of Enron's slashed credit ratings.
Reassurances from Enron that banks have agreed to extend the due date past =
next Tuesday gave the stock a modest prop. Shares closed the day at $5.01, =
down $1.98, for a market capitalization of less than $4-billion. Enron shar=
es now stand 45 per cent below their Monday close, and a fraction of their =
$80 level in February.=20
Industry observers fear the news of the debt problem -- the latest in a str=
ing of nasty surprises from the company -- could jeopardize a rescue of the=
 once-dominant global energy merchant by smaller hometown rival Dynegy Inc.=
 The two companies struck a merger deal that would see Dynegy buy Enron for=
 about $8.9-billion in stock on Nov. 9.=20
U.S. analyst Michael Worms said Enron's recent disclosures made the deal's =
fate uncertain.=20
"Obviously, with the most recent disclosures regarding Enron, it renewed un=
certainty as to whether or not this deal would still go through," said Mr. =
Worms, an analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York who was bullish abo=
ut the deal last week.=20
The market apparently considers it far from a done deal as well, with the s=
pread between Dynegy's share offer and Enron's price widening substantially=
 this week. At a share exchange ratio of 0.2685 of a Dynegy share for each =
Enron share, Enron shareholders would receive about $10.67 at Dynegy's clos=
ing price of $39.76 on the NYSE yesterday.=20
But in a statement issued later in the day, the two companies insisted the =
merger is still on.=20
"We are continuing our confirmatory due diligence and working to accelerate=
 the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger," Chuck Watson, D=
ynegy's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement.=20
In a separate statement, Enron chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay said company ex=
ecutives "continue to believe that this merger is in the best interests of =
our shareholders, employees and lenders."=20
But industry observers said Enron remains in a precarious position. As cred=
it concerns balloon, trading partners are increasingly reluctant to do busi=
ness with the company.=20
"Enron is definitely losing market share on credit concerns," said Michael =
Barbis, an analyst at Fulcrum Global Partners. As a result, "the market per=
ceives Enron as needing more cash."=20
The very methods that contributed to Enron's rapid rise are generally seen =
now as the reason for its woes.=20
Enron, established in 1985, grew from a modest natural gas pipeline company=
 with annual revenue of less than $5-billion to an energy giant with revenu=
e pegged at about $200-billion this year.=20
To finance this explosive rate of growth, the company created a vast and im=
penetrable network of affiliated entities or partnerships to divert billion=
s of dollars of debt -- which would have jeopardized Enron's credit rating =
and limited growth -- from its balance sheet.=20
But the off-balance sheet transactions caught up with the company in recent=
 months, with Enron announcing a $618-million third-quarter loss and disclo=
sed a $1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity in part because of the p=
artnerships.=20
The company followed with more disturbing news, saying earnings have been o=
verstated by about $600-million since 1997.=20
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now investigating Enron in r=
elation to the partnerships, some of which were headed by former Enron exec=
utives.=20
Lawsuits have also been flying at the company as shareholders line up in an=
 attempt to recover more than $15-billion in lost market value since Septem=
ber.=20
Meanwhile, its would-be acquirer, Dynegy, hasn't been immune to the fallout=
 of the latest developments. Its stock dropped yesterday too, and at $39.76=
 is well below the $47.20 it hit last week, but above the $33 low it was tr=
ading at before the merger deal was announced.=20
Analysts said that if the merger goes through, Dynegy stands to gain consid=
erably. The company estimates the addition of Enron will beef up its bottom=
 line by about 35 per cent or 90 to 95 cents a share next year, a sizable c=
hunk of profit that would justify a share price in the $60 to $70 range.=20
"The outlook for earnings over the next couple of years, assuming the acqui=
sition of Enron is successful, is significant," said Mr. Worms of Gerard Kl=
auer Mattison. Despite Enron's latest troubles, he maintained a "buy" ratin=
g on Dynegy with a 12-month target of $68.=20
Dynegy has also taken moves to limit its downside. The company is injecting=
 $1.5-billion of cash into Enron, but it gets rights to Enron's prized 27,0=
00-kilometre Northern Natural Gas pipeline in return for its investment if =
Enron goes under.=20
As well, the merger agreement specifies that Dynegy can walk away from the =
deal if legal costs exceed $3.5-billion.=20
"The bet here is, can Dynegy's management pull this off, and can Enron stay=
 afloat until the merger closes?" said John Meloy, an analyst at Simmons & =
Co. International in Houston.

Officials of Dynegy Inc. on Wednesday weighed whether to seek to renegotiat=
e the terms of an agreement to acquire Enron Corp., its Houston rival, whil=
e Enron and its bankers sought to shore up the energy trader's finances, ex=
ecutives close to the two firms said.=20
Although Enron said it secured the remaining $450 million of a new $1 billi=
on credit line and pushed back the deadline for repaying a $690 million deb=
t, its shares fell a further 28 percent, after falling 23 percent on Tuesda=
y.
"If Dynegy steps away entirely from the merger, Enron's credit situation se=
ems untenable, with a bankruptcy filing highly possible," rating agency Fit=
ch Investors said.=20
UBS Warburg analyst Ron Barone said "bankruptcy would not be out of the que=
stion" if the merger fell through or ran into obstacles.=20
"We believe the odds of Enron incurring a material adverse change on its op=
erations is soaring," Barone said in a research note, saying that Dynegy ma=
y invoke clauses allowing it to walk away from or alter the terms of the $9=
 billion agreement.=20
In a statement, Enron said it was in feverish talks with its other lenders =
to restructure its debt obligations and reaffirmed its commitment to the Dy=
negy deal.=20
"We continue to believe that this merger is in the best interests of our sh=
areholders, employees and lenders," Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenn=
eth Lay said.=20
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James Lee said in the same statement =
that Chase believes its interests and those of Enron and its other primary =
lenders are aligned, and that the bank would "develop a plan to strengthen =
Enron's financial position up to and through its merger with Dynegy."=20
Enron's shares fell $1.98 to close at $5.01. It was the most actively trade=
d issue on the New York Stock Exchange for a second day in a row.=20
The shares had dipped as low as $4.55 on Wednesday, rebounding slightly aft=
er Enron's announcement. Accounting for stock splits, that is the lowest En=
ron has traded since February 1989.=20
Dynegy shares were off $1.94, or 4.65 percent, at $39.76.=20
Dynegy on board=20
Dynegy Chairman and CEO Chuck Watson said he is encouraged by the new loan =
and debt extension. Watson said in a statement that Dynegy was working to "=
accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger."=20
Watson said ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26 percent of Dynegy, reiterate=
d its "full confidence" in Dynegy's ability to complete the merger.=20
However, Dynegy officials worried Wednesday that even discussing the idea o=
f renegotiating the merger agreement could damage confidence in Enron among=
 investors and other energy traders.=20
An executive close to Dynegy said that there did not yet appear to be legal=
 grounds on which to break up the deal unilaterally. Nor, he added, was Dyn=
egy prepared to demand that Enron allow the terms of the deal to be changed=
.=20
An Enron spokeswoman said that she was not aware of any attempts by Dynegy =
to renegotiate the deal.=20
Privately, analysts were calling the odds of success lower since Enron made=
 a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday alerting in=
vestors to its credit crunch.=20
Monday's filing noted that Enron's financial woes have led to a "reduced le=
vel of transaction activity" with the company by trading partners.=20
Most analysts interviewed by Reuters called the chances of the deal even, w=
here earlier they had listed odds of success at 60 percent to 70 percent.=
=20
However, one analyst said he thought emotion was driving the current stock =
moves, and that it comes despite three powerful factors in favor of the dea=
l.=20
"The bottom line, Enron needs this to happen, Dynegy wants this to happen, =
and ChevronTexaco is supportive of it happening," Credit Suisse First Bosto=
n analyst Curt Launer said.=20
Trading deals down=20
Goldman Sachs downgraded Enron and Dynegy to "market perform," and took bot=
h off its recommended list. Goldman said the cash infusion from Dynegy--$1.=
5 billion--"appears inadequate to restore the confidence of Enron customers=
."=20
Enron's trading partners said they were treading carefully.=20
"We've been scaling back for some time, but we're still dealing with Enron.=
 Every day, our credit people are watching," said Al Butkus, a vice preside=
nt with Kansas City-based UtiliCorp United Inc.=20
The trading business, Enron's crown jewel and the part most coveted by Dyne=
gy, relies on volume for profitability, and Enron has said it was possible =
that the lower volumes would hamper fourth- quarter earnings.=20
One indicator of Enron's shape was the fact that its bonds are being quoted=
 by price, like junk bonds, rather than by how much extra yield they carry =
over U.S. Treasuries, like investment-grade bonds.=20
The company's 6.4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and 6.75 percent notes mat=
uring in 2009 were respectively bid Wednesday afternoon at 62 and 60 cents =
on the dollar, each down from the high 60s on Tuesday. Their yields to matu=

WASHINGTON -- An accounting industry watchdog won't investigate auditing pr=
oblems at Enron Corp. despite a request from a senior U.S. lawmaker, but ma=
y take a broader look at what's causing recent audit debacles.=20
"Investigation of the Enron situation rests with the SEC," Public Oversight=
 Board Chairman Charles Bowsher said. "We can't run a separate investigatio=
n."
The Securities and Exchange Commission is examining accounting and audit pr=
oblems at Houston-based Enron, focusing on investments in limited partnersh=
ips tied to former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. Enron has acknowl=
edged it overstated net income by $586 million (663.8 million euros) and wi=
ll need to restate five years of financial reports.=20
Citing concerns about the accounting industry's peer-review process, Rep. J=
ohn Dingell asked the Public Oversight Board to conduct a special investiga=
tion of Arthur Andersen LLP and its audit work for Enron.=20
Mr. Bowsher said the oversight board won't open a special investigation, le=
aving that to the SEC and the industry's quality-control inquiry committee,=
 but will decide at its next meeting whether to take "a hard look" at recen=
t, high-profile audit blowups.=20
"We're probably going to want to look at some of these major audit failures=
, and that's not limited to Andersen," Mr. Bowsher said.=20
He cited recent audit failures involving Cendant Corp., Microstrategy Inc.,=
 Sunbeam Corp. and Waste Management Inc., saying "I think we ought to look =
at them all."=20
Former SEC chief accountant Lynn Turner expressed disappointment at the ove=
rsight board's reluctance to exercise its investigative muscle, given a ras=
h of financial restatements and frauds that have cost investors more than $=
100 billion in recent years.=20
"In light of losses that have reached the magnitude of the savings-and-loan=
 debacle, it's time for the POB to start carrying out investigations of wha=
t's happening at the audit firms," Mr. Turner said.=20
He said Rep. Dingell is right to question the accounting profession's abili=
ty to police itself through so-called peer reviews, saying recent audit fai=
lures "are evidence that the peer-review process is not as robust as it nee=
ds to be."=20
Firms that audit public companies must undergo peer review every three year=
s, subjecting their work to scrutiny by a competing audit firm or a panel a=
ppointed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. In prac=
tice, the Big Five firms hire each other to conduct the oversight, with no =
requirement to rotate assignments, and critics say reviewers aren't as toug=
h as they could or should be.=20
"There's a tendency in the peer reviews, even when problems are identified,=
 to regard them as isolated instances," not evidence of a systemic failure =
at an audit firm, said Douglas Carmichael, an accounting professor at Baruc=
h College in New York.=20
Mr. Bowsher defends peer reviews as "a very rigorous, thorough process," bu=
t concedes they haven't prevented a recent bout of problematic audits. He s=
uggested that may be due to factors from bad judgment on the part of indivi=
dual partners to questions about applying accounting and auditing standards=
.=20
In Enron's case, the quality-control inquiry committee, composed of about a=
 dozen CPAs, will investigate Andersen's audit work but critics doubt it wi=
ll do much digging.

Employees' Retirement Plan Is a Victim as Enron Tumbles
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

11/22/2001
The New York Times=20
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company=20

The rapid decline of the Enron Corporation has devastated its employees' re=
tirement plan, which was heavy with company stock, and has infuriated worke=
rs, who were prohibited from changing their investments as the stock plunge=
d.=20
Through the 401(k) retirement plan, employees chose to put much of their sa=
vings in Enron shares, and the company made contributions in company stock =
as well. But around the time Enron disclosed serious financial problems las=
t month, the company froze the assets in the plan because of an administrat=
ive change. For several weeks, as the stock lost much of its value, workers=
 stood by helplessly as their retirement savings evaporated. They were not =
allowed to switch investments at all -- even though the plan had far less r=
isky choices.
The unfortunate timing caps a year of pain for Enron's workers. At the end =
of last year, the 401(k) plan had $2.1 billion in assets. More than half wa=
s invested in Enron, an energy conglomerate. Since then, the stock has lost=
 94 percent of its value.=20
At Portland General Electric, the Oregon utility acquired by Enron four yea=
rs ago, some workers nearing retirement have lost hundreds of thousands of =
dollars. The utility has lined up grief counselors to help them work throug=
h their problems.=20
''We had some married couples who both worked who lost as much as $800,000 =
or $900,000,'' said Steve Lacey, an emergency-repair dispatcher for Portlan=
d General. ''It pretty much wiped out every employee's savings plan.''=20
''Shortly after it was frozen, the articles started coming out about some o=
f the questionable activities of Enron,'' Mr. Lacey added. ''The stock took=
 a tremendous drop, and we were pretty much helpless.''=20
The loss serves as a grim reminder of the danger of relying too heavily on =
one investment. Stock plunges similar to Enron's have also wiped out the re=
tirement savings of many employees of the Nortel Networks Corporation, Luce=
nt Technologies Inc. and Global Crossing Ltd.=20
The loss by Enron's workers also stands in stark contrast to the profits ma=
de by some senior Enron executives, who sold stock during the last few year=
s. Enron's chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, made $20.7 million during the first se=
ven months of 2001 by exercising stock options -- and more than $180 millio=
n by exercising options during the three prior years. Last week, Mr. Lay ag=
reed to forgo a $60 million severance package after Enron traders and emplo=
yees made clear how upset they were that he would profit from the proposed =
acquisition of the company by Dynegy Inc. while they were suffering.=20
Enron -- which is already the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commissi=
on investigation of transactions among Enron and partnerships headed by the=
 company's former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, and a number o=
f shareholders' suits -- now has an additional legal problem.=20
On Tuesday, Steve W. Berman, a lawyer from Seattle who represented states a=
gainst the tobacco industry, filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in H=
ouston seeking class-action status on behalf of Enron employees who lost mo=
ney on the stock through their retirement plan. The lawsuit says that Enron=
 schemed to pump up the price of the stock artificially and violated its fi=
duciary duty to its employees by failing to act in their best interests.=20
''They were promoting Enron as a retirement investment vehicle and matching=
 employees' contributions with Enron stock, when they knew the stock was ov=
ervalued, and that's a breach of their fiduciary duties,'' Mr. Berman said =
in an interview yesterday.=20
What's more, he said, the assets were frozen on Oct. 17, with the stock at =
$32.20, even though Enron executives knew there would be imminent disclosur=
es about the company's accounting practices. ''They knew the worst news was=
 about to come out, but they froze the stock,'' he said.=20
Enron closed yesterday at $5.01.=20
The company declined to comment on much of the allegations because of pendi=
ng litigation. A spokeswoman, Karen Denne, said that the change in plan adm=
inistrators had been in the works for a number of months and that she did n=
ot know the exact date the change was put into effect.=20
Like many other big companies, Enron made its contributions to the plan in =
company shares. But employees also chose to put much of their own contribut=
ions into the stock, lured by its stellar past performance. The company say=
s that 89 percent of the Enron stock in the plan wound up there because emp=
loyees chose it, and 11 percent was the company's contribution.=20
''A lot of people believed in the stock, so it wasn't just the company matc=
h,'' said an employee at Enron's headquarters in downtown Houston. ''It was=
 their own money, too. People are just shell-shocked.''=20
The stock's past performance had lured many workers. Last year, as the stoc=
k soared, total assets in the 401(k) plan rose more than 35 percent.=20
About 57 percent of Enron's 21,000 employees participate in the 401(k) plan=
. The company generally matches employee contributions at 50 cents on the d=
ollar, up to 6 percent of their salary, with Enron stock, which cannot be s=
old and put into another investment until the employee reaches age 50. But =
Ms. Denne said workers otherwise ''have a range of options'' in which to in=
vest their money.=20
Gerry O'Connor, a senior consultant with the Spectrem Group, a consulting f=
irm based in Chicago, said it was not uncommon for companies to freeze asse=
ts when administrators were switched. ''If you don't, you can wind up with =
misallocated money, wrong statements, and all kinds of complicating factors=
,'' he said.=20
But a heavy dose of assets in one company stock has been a concern to many =
specialists in retirement planning. Employees are taking ''a lot of risk, b=
ut they don't think of it as such,'' Mr. O'Connor said.=20
''They say, 'You know, I work for this company, and we're doing great.' ''=
=20
In addition to the swoon in their 401(k) plans, Enron employees have watche=
d the value of their stock options wither. Enron gave a far larger percenta=
ge of employees options than most companies do, but now, with the fall in E=
nron shares, nearly all of those options are worthless.=20
Enron's tumbling fortunes have come as a particular shock to some of its wo=
rkers in Oregon. About 95 percent of the 2,700 employees of Portland Genera=
l, which Enron recently agreed to sell to help it raise badly needed cash, =
are invested in the 401(k) plan, said Scott Simms, a spokesman.=20
The losses, he added, have hit everyone ''including officers all the way th=
rough to other staff.''=20
''It's certainly not something in which certain employees have lost out and=
 others haven't,'' he said. ''It was the same plan for everyone.''=20
In an interview with The Oregonian in Portland, Peggy Y. Fowler, Portland G=
eneral's chief executive, said the asset freeze was an unfortunate coincide=
nce. ''The timing couldn't have been worse,'' she said.=20
''We refer to our retirement program as a three-legged stool -- Social Secu=
rity, the company pension and the 401(k),'' Ms. Fowler said. ''One of the l=
egs has been cut off.''

Circling the Wagons Around Enron
Risks Too Great To Let Trader Just Die
By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and RIVA D. ATLAS

11/22/2001
The New York Times=20
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company=20

Officials of Dynegy yesterday weighed whether to seek to renegotiate the te=
rms of the company's agreement to acquire Enron, its Houston rival, while E=
nron and its bankers sought to shore up its finances, executives close to t=
he two companies said.=20
The discussions came as the stock and energy markets continued to register =
doubts about the financial stability of Enron, the energy trading concern. =
Enron's stock fell another 27 percent, even though the company won a three-=
week reprieve from its banks on a $690 million note that would have come du=
e next Tuesday if Enron had been unable to come up with collateral.
An executive close to Enron described the loan extension, by J. P. Morgan C=
hase and Citigroup, as a Band-Aid, given the approach of Thanksgiving. ''Pe=
ople are trying to take the time to come up with something for the intermed=
iate term,'' the executive added.=20
The bankers also met with investors, including leveraged buyout firms and t=
wo industrial companies, which might inject up to $2 billion into Enron und=
er arrangements that would protect them from a further collapse in the comp=
any's stock, the executives said.=20
The new investments would be in Enron's Transwestern Pipeline, which links =
natural gas fields in Texas to the California market, they said. The deals =
would be structured like Dynegy's agreement, as part of the merger, to infu=
se $1.5 billion into the Enron subsidiary that owns the Northern Natural Ga=
s pipeline. That arrangement lets Dynegy keep the pipeline even if the merg=
er falls apart.=20
Besides talking with other potential investors, J. P. Morgan Chase and Citi=
group agreed to terms that have each taking a $250 million equity stake in =
such a deal, the executives said. The bankers plan to meet with Enron offic=
ials on Monday to complete the transactions, they added.=20
Karen Denne, an Enron spokeswoman, noted that the company had previously sa=
id it was seeking a further infusion of up to $1 billion in equity. ''We ar=
e not going to discuss the specifics of who we are talking to,'' she said.=
=20
Though investors again manhandled the stock of Enron, which is down 94 perc=
ent this year, the banks, Dynegy and credit-rating agencies all sought to p=
roceed delicately. Executives explained that hasty moves could only deepen =
the crisis of confidence in Enron, wiping out the energy trading operations=
 that only months ago made it one of the nation's most admired and politica=
lly influential companies.=20
Dynegy officials worried yesterday that even talking about renegotiating th=
e merger deal could damage confidence in Enron among investors and other en=
ergy traders.=20
An executive close to Dynegy said that there did not yet appear to be legal=
 grounds on which to break up the deal unilaterally. Nor, he added, was Dyn=
egy prepared to demand that Enron allow the terms of the deal to be changed=
. But he indicated that the situation could change.=20
Ms. Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said that she was not aware of any attemp=
ts by Dynegy to renegotiate the deal. Dynegy issued a statement saying that=
 its chief executive, Chuck Watson, was encouraged by the steps Enron had t=
aken with its bankers. Mr. Watson said the company was continuing its due d=
iligence on the deal.=20
Dynegy's shares, which rose as high as $46.94 in the days after the merger =
was announced, on Nov. 9, closed yesterday at $39.76, down more than 4 perc=
ent for the second consecutive day.=20
Enron was the most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange, cl=
osing at $5.01, down $1.98. That means the premium that Dynegy would be pay=
ing for Enron has risen to 115 percent.=20
Analysts following Enron's debt said that bankers had little choice but to =
support the company, given that most of Enron's bank debt is not secured. T=
hat means that if bankers pushed Enron into bankruptcy, they would receive =
no better treatment than the holders of more than $6 billion in Enron bonds=
 and other debt.=20
Enron said it was in talks with lenders to restructure $9.15 billion in deb=
t that will come due by the end of 2002. ''If the Dynegy deal closed, that =
would be the best thing for the banks,'' said one analyst following the deb=
t.=20
James B. Lee Jr., vice chairman of J. P. Morgan Chase, echoed that thought =
in a statement issued by Enron. ''We believe the interests of Chase and Enr=
on's other primary lenders are aligned in this restructuring effort,'' he s=
aid. ''We will work with Enron and its other primary lenders to develop a p=
lan to strengthen Enron's financial position up to and through its merger w=
ith Dynegy.'' Along with Citigroup, J. P. Morgan Chase is Enron's lead bank=
, and it is also an adviser on the merger with Dynegy.=20
Another group with the power to push Enron to the brink, the big credit-rat=
ing agencies, continued to step gingerly. The agencies have held Enron's de=
bt rating one step above ''junk'' status, knowing that downgrading it furth=
er would force the company to pay or refinance up to $3.9 billion in debt -=
- effectively rendering Enron insolvent. One rating agency official said ye=
sterday that such a move would roil the entire debt market, adding that it =
was ''patriotic'' to hold off.=20
Still, one rating agency, Fitch, put out a strongly worded commentary yeste=
rday.=20
''If Dynegy steps away entirely from the merger, Enron's credit situation s=
eems untenable, with a bankruptcy filing highly possible,'' wrote Ralph Pel=
lecchia and Glen Grabelsky, the Fitch analysts following Enron. ''Our prese=
nt BBB- rating rests on the merger possibility and continued support of the=
 lending banks, without which Fitch would consider lowering the rating.''=
=20
Analysts and energy executives said that Enron's collapse -- though unthink=
able just weeks ago -- would be unlikely to cause a meltdown in the nation'=
s energy markets. While Enron has been the nation's biggest trader of elect=
ric power and natural gas, many other companies -- including Dynegy -- make=
 markets in those commodities. Analysts say the gradual unfolding of Enron'=
s financial woes this fall has given its trading partners time to unwind de=
als and limit their exposure to Enron.=20
Yet even one of Enron's most stubborn supporters was forced to concede yest=
erday that his confidence had been shattered by the company's problems, inc=
luding the rapid depletion of its cash reserves, restatements that erased $=
600 million in earnings and the surprise disclosure of the $690 million deb=
t.=20
That fan, Goldman, Sachs & Company's energy analyst, David Fleischer, downg=
raded the shares to neutral. Until yesterday, Goldman had kept the stock on=
 its recommended list.

On the days it was cold and damp, utility lineman Roy Rinard would think ab=
out the future.=20
His hip hurt from arthritis, and his lungs hurt from sarcoidosis, but Rinar=
d knew on days like that he'd be climbing poles for only four or five more =
years.
That's because the 54-year-old was pumping every dime he could into his 401=
(k) plan at work and getting a dollar-for-dollar match. And the money was p=
iling up in the 21 years he worked there.=20
Earlier this year, Rinard had $472,000 in his 401(k) plan. Today, it's wort=
h about $40,000.=20
That's because Rinard is a lineman with Enron-owned Portland General Electr=
ic in Portland, Ore.=20
In January, Enron was trading for $84.87. Wednesday it closed at $5.01 a sh=
are.=20
Part of the reason that Rinard lost so much money is that Enron gives its e=
mployees their 401(k) match in company stock. That was great when the stock=
 was flying high but as the stock has tanked, employee retirement accounts =
have evaporated.=20
It's fairly common for employers to give their 401(k) match in their own co=
mpany stock, said Scott Alt, assistant vice president of Aon Consulting, a =
human resources consulting firm in Houston.=20
It's often cheaper for a company to provide stock because they don't have t=
o put out the cash, said Alt, who sets up 401(k) plans for companies.=20
And giving stock makes the employees shareholders, which many executives be=
lieves breed loyalty. They work a little harder when they own the company, =
Alt said.=20
And employees like it -- except, of course, if the stock plummets.=20
At Enron, the problem was compounded when many employees, including Rinard,=
 saw Enron's stock doing so well that they decided to put their entire acco=
unt into Enron stock.=20
Enron executives were talking about how the stock price was poised to climb=
 above $100 a share, he recalled. It was going to $120.=20
Rinard and a co-worker, Steve Lacey, have filed an Employee Retirement Inco=
me Security Act, or ERISA, lawsuit in Houston contending that Enron reckles=
sly endangered their retirement funds.=20
Steve Berman, managing partner for the law firm of Hagens Berman in Seattle=
, said Enron touted the value of its stock and encouraged employees to put =
their entire portfolio into Enron stock.=20
Enron officials didn't emphasize the risk and instead painted the situation=
 as positive, especially when things were going downhill, said Berman, who =
is hoping to get the suit certified as a class-action case.=20
He's hoping to prove that the 401(k) plan executives failed to act responsi=
bly when they knew about serious business problems.=20
Berman is hoping to break some new legal ground with his case. It's pattern=
ed after a case against Lucent Technologies in which Lucent employees sued =
their employer this summer for matching their 401(k) contributions with com=
pany stock that later tanked. That case is still in litigation.=20
Another troubling feature of the Enron 401(k) plan was that employees were =
not allowed to make trades for about a month. Unfortunately, the lockdown b=
egan Oct. 17, the day after Enron surprised the market that it was taking a=
 $1.01 billion after-tax third-quarter charge to get out of bad investments=
.=20
Enron officials, who did not return a telephone call for this column, have =
said they had planned the lockdown for several months because it was changi=
ng plan administrators.=20
But that timing was disastrous for Rinard and his co-workers who couldn't s=
ell their shares between the time it was $33.84 a share on Oct. 16 and when=
 they could begin to trade again at less than $10 a share.=20
"I just watched it drop, horrified," Rinard said. "There wasn't a thing I c=
ould do about it."=20
Like many employees, Rinard's 401(k) retirement fund was the only thing he =
had. And now Rinard is kicking himself for trusting his company too much.=
=20
Before the wheels came off the wagon, retirement was a doable thing, Rinard=
 said. The end was in sight.=20
"Now, after 35 years of climbing poles, I'm just right back to where I star=
ted."

Enron Shares Fall Again on Doubts Energy: A retreat by bankers or a credit =
downgrade could threaten Dynegy merger and land firm in bankruptcy. Stock t=

NEW YORK -- Investors pounded shares of Enron Corp. to a 12-year low Wednes=
day amid mounting doubts about whether the Houston-based energy-trading kin=
g can survive long enough to complete its announced takeover by cross-town =
rival Dynegy Inc.=20
Enron shares plunged $1.98, or 28%, to close at $5.01 in New York Stock Exc=
hange trading, its lowest level since April 1989. Enron, a Wall Street darl=
ing just months ago, is down 94% year-to-date.
A minefield stands between Enron and the merger, analysts said. Almost any =
stumble--a further downgrade by a credit rating agency, a retreat by Enron'=
s bankers or trading partners, another negative surprise about its financia=
l condition--could pitch it into bankruptcy.=20
Still, the credit rating agencies held their fire Wednesday, keeping Enron'=
s bonds one notch above "junk," or sub-investment-grade, status.=20
Enron also gained some breathing space from its lenders, announcing that a =
$690-million note payment due Tuesday had been postponed to mid-December.=
=20
"I think they'll probably limp through [to the merger]," said analyst Micha=
el S. Worms of Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York. "But it's a bad limp."=
=20
There were no major new disclosures to prompt Wednesday's sell-off, but inv=
estors seemed to be afraid to hold Enron stock over the Thanksgiving weeken=
d, traders said. The stock market is closed today and open Friday for an ab=
breviated session--traditionally the lightest trading day of the year.=20
Enron shares plummeted 23% on Tuesday in reaction to a filing Monday with t=
he Securities and Exchange Commission in which Enron disclosed the $690-mil=
lion obligation. The disclosure was a surprise even to the credit rating ag=
encies that have been in constant contact with Enron executives since the c=
ompany's finances began unraveling last month.=20
The rating agencies' view is critical, because under some controversial Enr=
on deals that have come to light recently, a downgrade to junk level would =
be a "trigger event" requiring Enron to immediately pay $3.9 billion to cre=
ditors, the company said in Monday's SEC filing.=20
Such an event could instantly bankrupt the company, analysts said.=20
Enron has been reeling since mid-October, when it began disclosing details =
of deals involving limited partnerships organized by current or former comp=
any executives. The partnerships' purpose appears partly to have been to pu=
mp up Enron's reported profit while concealing large amounts of debt it was=
 incurring.=20
The SEC has announced that it is investigating the situation.=20
In addition to announcing the delayed payment, Enron said Wednesday that it=
 had tapped the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1-billion=
 credit line from its chief lenders, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup =
Inc.=20
Enron probably can restructure its debts and postpone most payments until M=
ay, analyst Ronald M. Barone of Standard & Poor's rating agency said Wednes=
day. It is in the lenders' interest to cooperate, as much of Enron's debt i=
s unsecured by hard assets, and the banks would stand to lose most of their=
 principal in a bankruptcy, he said.=20
Dynegy broke its recent silence Wednesday by issuing a statement in which C=
hairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said he was "encouraged" by the ne=
ws of Enron's agreements with its lenders.=20
Dynegy is "working to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to compl=
ete the merger," Watson said, adding that oil giant ChevronTexaco Corp., wh=
ich owns 26% of Dynegy's stock, reiterated its support for the deal.=20
Ratcheting up the pressure on Enron, another credit rating agency, Fitch In=
c., issued a statement Wednesday listing its own concerns. Enron's energy t=
rading partners seem to be demanding more cash collateral and reducing thei=
r exposure to Enron, which calls into question the ongoing value of the com=
pany's core trading business, Fitch said.=20
Although Dynegy has reiterated its intention to complete the merger, Enron'=
s problems make renegotiating the merger terms or canceling the deal a poss=
ibility, Fitch said.=20
"If Dynegy steps away entirely from the merger, Enron's credit situation se=
ems untenable, with a bankruptcy filing highly possible," Fitch said.=20
If the merger falls through, Dynegy still will retain the right to purchase=
 Enron's Northern Natural Gas Co. pipeline system for $1.5 billion.=20
However, analyst Andre Meade of Commerzbank Securities said he believes Dyn=
egy still is mainly interested in the trading franchise.=20
"I don't think it's worth Dynegy's while to go through all this pain if the=
y just want to pick up assets [such as the pipeline] on the cheap," Meade s=
aid.

Enron Stock Declines Further On Release of Regulatory Filing --- Document R=

Enron Corp.'s stock and bond prices took another beating after the energy c=
ompany's release late Monday of its much-anticipated third-quarter financia=
l filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This revealed po=
tentially major new cash-flow and earnings headaches.=20
As of 4 p.m. in New York Tuesday, Enron shares were at $6.99, down $2.07, o=
r 23%. Enron once again topped the exchange's most-active list with 89.9 mi=
llion shares traded, more than twice the volume of the next most active sto=
ck.
Enron bond prices fell into the range of between 70 cents and 80 cents on t=
he dollar, according to market observers. Following the announcement earlie=
r this month of Dynegy Inc.'s plan to buy Enron for around $10 billion in s=
tock, bond prices had firmed to above 80 cents on the dollar.=20
A Dynegy spokesman Tuesday wouldn't comment on the status of the pending ac=
quisition, other than to say his company was reviewing Enron's third-quarte=
r financial report, filed with the SEC, as part of continuing "due diligenc=
e." Under the proposed acquisition, Dynegy would exchange 0.2685 of its sha=
res for each Enron share. Based on Dynegy's 4 p.m. price Tuesday of $41.70 =
a share, off $1.90, the deal values Enron shares at about $11.20 -- well ab=
ove the current market price.=20
Monday's third-quarter financial report from Enron, which supplemented and =
revised Enron's earnings announcement last month, reinforced fears that the=
 energy-trading company is in a "precarious financial position and will be =
for awhile," said Andre Meade, head of U.S. utility research at Commerzbank=
 Securities.=20
Enron's SEC filing Monday said that because of the company's deteriorated c=
redit standing, it might have to repay a $690 million note by this coming M=
onday. The filing also said Enron might be forced to take a $700 million pr=
etax charge to earnings in the current quarter, ending Dec. 31, due to a dr=
op in value of some of its assets.=20
Houston-based Enron has been in deepening financial distress for the past m=
onth, since announcing big asset and shareholder-equity reductions in the t=
hird quarter.

FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Enron granted breathing space - US energy grou=
p postpones $690m in repayments as it fights for survival.=20
Enron, the crisis-hit US energy trader, won a stay of execution from its le=
nders yesterday but remained on a knife edge as it struggled to restore the=
 confidence of customers, bankers and investors.
The former stock market star said repayment of $690m ( #479m) of outstandin=
g notes would be postponed from next Tuesday to "mid-December". The group a=
lso said it had finalised the remaining $450m of a $1bn credit line from JP=
 Morgan Chase and Salomon Smith Barney, part of Citigroup.=20
Enron's survival is crucial to the smooth functioning of the US energy mark=
et, which the group dominates. Its failure would also have severe repercuss=
ions in the wider financial markets, where Enron offsets much of the risk o=
f energy price changes.=20
Negotiations with lenders are set to continue through today's Thanksgiving =
holiday, according to people close to the talks.=20
Whether Enron can survive depends on the commitment of Dynegy, rival US ene=
rgy group, to its $9bn rescue takeover bid, announced two weeks ago. Dynegy=
 said yesterday it was "encouraged" that Enron had progressed in boosting i=
ts liquidity and it was continuing the "due diligence" review of Enron's op=
erations.=20
Some analysts believe Enron will burn through its cash balances of $1.2bn b=
efore the Dynegy deal can be completed next year.=20
David Fleischer of Goldman Sachs, one of the last remaining bulls on Enron,=
 downgraded the stock yesterday, pointing out that cash balances were inade=
quate to pay off debt obligations of $2.8bn by the end of the year.=20
One person close to the talks with lenders said Enron had a medium-term pla=
n for restructuring $9.15bn of debt due by the end of next year. Jimmy Lee,=
 vice-chairman of JP Morgan Chase, said the bank would work to "strengthen =
Enron's financial position up to and through its merger with Dynegy".=20
In morning trading yesterday, Enron's stock fell 33 per cent before it anno=
unced the extension of the $690m repayment. The group's bonds had also fall=
en to levels that suggested Enron faced bankruptcy.=20
By lunchtime in New York the stock had recovered slightly and was trading a=
t $4.97, 29 per cent lower on the day. The shares started the week at $9, b=
ut a regulatory filing by Enron on Monday that detailed the extent of its d=
ebt prompted traders to limit exposure before Thanksgiving.=20

Lenders throw Enron lifeline but Dynegy is main rescue hope
NEIL HUME I N NEW YORK

Enron, the debt-stricken energy trading group that owns Wessex Water, was t=
hrown a lifeline yesterday by its lenders who postponed the repayment of a =
$690m (pounds 487m) loan due next week. But its survival still depends on w=
hether its smaller rival Dynegy goes ahead with its $9.6bn rescue takeover.=
=20
Last night Dynegy said it was encouraged by the agreement and was seeking w=
ays to speed up regulatory clearance of the deal that would create the domi=
nant force in US energy trading.
Enron shares, which touched $4.55 - their lowest price since February 1989 =
- before the banks announced that the repayment deadline would be extended =
from next Tuesday to mid-December, were down in afternoon trading yesterday=
 by $1.74 at $5.25.=20
Enron also said it had drawn down the remaining $450m of a $1bn secured cre=
dit line from JP Morgan and Schroder Salomon Smith Barney.=20
"We have been in contact with our banks and believe we can identify a mutua=
lly beneficial restructuring to enhance our cash position, strengthen our b=
alance sheet and address upcoming maturities," said Jeffrey McMahon, Enron'=
s chief financial officer=20
This week, Enron shares went into yet another free fall following the publi=
cation of a third-quarter filing with the securities and exchange commissio=
n in which the company warned that last week's credit rating downgrade by S=
tandard & Poor's would trigger the repayment of the $690m loan on Tuesday. =
Enron also revealed it would have to repay $9.15bn of debt by the end of ne=
xt year.=20
That news sparked fears that Enron might run out of cash before the Dynegy =
takeover. Both firms estimated it could take six to nine months to gain reg=
ulatory approval without special dispensation.=20
Dynegy is offering 0.2685 shares for each Enron share and under the terms o=
f the deal can walk away if Enron's problems turn out to be worse than prev=
iously thought.=20
Yesterday's agreements will help restore confidence among Enron's customers=
, seen as the key to the deal. The energy trading division is Enron's main =
profit engine and the major attraction for Dynegy.=20
In the past two months Enron has suffered a fall from grace. It shares have=
 lost 90% of their value since it sacked its finance director Andrew Fastow=
 in October for unusual transactions carried out off balance sheet. These f=
orced it to take a $1bn charge and cut shareholder equity by $1.2bn.=20
To shore up its financial position, Enron is likely to sell Wessex Water, f=
or which it paid pounds 1.4bn in 1998, and a number of gas-fired power stat=
ions, including the high performing 1,900MW Teesside plant.

Dynegy aims for quick merger with Enron

Copyright (c) 2001 The Deal LLC=20

Prompted by Enron's recent stock sell off, Houston energy trader Dynegy is =
trying to quicken the pace of the companies' $24 billion merger.=20
After watching Enron Corp.'s stock plummet at the start of a short holiday =
week, Houston energy trader Dynegy Inc. said Wednesday it would try to quic=
ken the pace of the companies' $24 billion merger.
Prompting Dynegy's statement was Enron's announcement that it closed on $45=
0 million of a promised $1 billion line of financing from J.P. Morgan Chase=
 & Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc., secured by the assets of its subsidia=
ry, Northern Natural Gas Co.=20
Dynegy, which has agreed to acquire crosstown rival Enron in an all-stock d=
eal, said it was encouraged by the development and was working to accelerat=
e the transaction.=20
The companies announced Nov. 9 their intent to merge in a deal that was val=
ued at $24 billion, including $13 billion in Enron debt.=20
Enron's stock price has plummeted since the company acknowledged the Securi=
ties and Exchange Commission was investigating its financial disclosures an=
d trading activities.=20
Dynegy said the financing terms also pleased ChevronTexaco Corp., which own=
s 29% of Dynegy.=20
ChevronTexaco agreed to pump $2.5 billion of new equity into Dynegy, $1.5 b=
illion of which immediately will be channeled into Enron and $1 billion at =
closing.=20
Dynegy will use the initial $1.5 billion to acquire preferred stock and oth=
er rights in an Enron subsidiary that owns the Northern Natural Gas pipelin=
e system. The funds will give Enron additional cash liquidity to support it=
s operations.=20
Enron, which last week closed on $650 million of financing secured by its T=
ranswestern Pipeline Co., also said it is in discussions with its primary l=
enders to make a formal postponement to mid-December of a $690 million paym=
ent that is due Tuesday.=20
"We believe the interests of Chase and Enron's other primary lenders are al=
igned in this restructuring effort," said James B. Lee, vice chairman of J.=

Enron Tries to Pacify Worries as More Investors Decide to Sell Shares

 Reporter (TM)=20

Faltering Houston energy trader Enron Corp. tried to calm investors' worrie=
s Wednesday, announcing progress in relieving its debt situation, but its s=
tock lost a quarter of its value for the second day in a row.=20
At one point Wednesday, shares hit a 12-year low, touching $4.55.
The stock partially recovered after the company said it negotiated a three-=
week extension on a $690 million note that became due next week after the c=
ompany's debt rating deteriorated.=20
Enron also said it closed on the remaining $450 million of a previously ann=
ounced $1 billion line of credit and is trying to restructure other debt.=
=20
Still, counting debts owed at the parent company and a subsidiary, Enron ne=
eds to raise nearly $1 billion to pay off notes coming due in the next mont=
h or so, said Scott Keller, an analyst at DealAnalytics.com.=20
Shares closed at $5.01, down $1.98, or 28 percent, in New York Stock Exchan=
ge trading.=20
Around 115.6 million shares changed hands, making it the most active stock =
on U.S. exchanges Wednesday.=20
Until its recent downfall, Enron was regarded as a high-flier among energy =
companies, having diversified from its natural gas roots to the electricity=
 trading and telecommunications industries. The stock hit a 52-week high of=
 $84.88 late last year.=20
An investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission this fall led to=
 the restatement of Enron's earnings back to 1997 and the disclosure of a n=
umber of complex and questionable partnerships -- some run by the company's=
 chief financial officer.=20
Mr. Keller said Wednesday that it's crucial that a special committee appoin=
ted by the company's board complete an internal investigation of financial =
dealings that prompted the SEC probe.=20
"Once your short-term liquidity runs out, it doesn't matter who wants to bu=
y you," Mr. Keller said=20
Although both Enron and Dynegy reaffirmed their commitment to a merger Wedn=
esday, analysts said Enron could be facing a bankruptcy filing long before =
a buyout if it doesn't restore enough confidence to raise the funds it need=
s.=20
The merger deal between Dynegy and Enron -- announced Nov. 9 --allows Dyneg=
y to back out of the transaction should there be a "material adverse change=
" in conditions.=20
Houston-based Dynegy could also decide to renegotiate the terms of the deal=
, which currently prices Enron at about $11 a share.=20
Considering Enron's credit problems and the growing number of companies can=
celing transactions with the energy trader, analysts are increasingly uncer=
tain that the deal will close at any price.=20
"What Dynegy is buying more than anything else is the trading operations," =
said Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg. "A week ago, I would have said t=
here was a 90 percent chance that this deal would go through. Now, I would =
say it's 50-50."=20
Early Wednesday, Goldman Sachs lowered its rating on Enron's stock. CIBC Wo=
rld Markets also cut Enron to a "hold" from a "buy."=20
And Mr. Youngberg lowered his rating to "sell" late Tuesday.=20
"Individual investors who are buying the stock now are really gambling with=
 their money," he said.=20
Indeed, those who are still holding Enron stock are in an all-or-nothing gu=
essing game, analysts said. Should they sell out now or hold on with the ho=
pe that the Dynegy deal will go through before Enron faces bankruptcy?=20
Lately, investors have been deciding in droves to sell. Enron has logged an=
 average daily trading volume of 47 million shares for the last month, comp=
ared with 2.1 million shares trading each day this time last year.=20
"What the market activity represents is the increasing uncertainty about wh=
ether you're going to get $10 or $11 or zero," Mr. Keller said.

From: =09Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON   On Behalf Of Steve Kean@ENR=
ON
Sent:=09Tuesday, October 09, 2001 11:04 PM
To:=09All Enron Worldwide@ENRON
Subject:=09Security Update


Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Som=
e of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personne=
l) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, =
there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all th=
e steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our faciliti=
es and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi=
ty, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business con=
trols organization.  You can contact this organization through their websit=
e (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email =
(CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John B=
rindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Pleas=
e feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, =
or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for t=
he Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be ins=
tituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?=09As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron =
Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?=09Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid =
picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S=
. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identif=
ication).=20

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing=
 in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca=
rd.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. o=
r foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identifica=
tion) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?=09Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b=
adged contractor at all times.

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo=
yee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby receptio=
n area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointm=
ent.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to=
 the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected=
, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the =
escorting employee or badged contractor.

?=09Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their =
workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Secu=
rity (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y=
ou or hold doors open, allowing "tail gating" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit=
uted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times=
 in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi=
pment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand the=
se measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. =09


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommenda=
tions:

?=09While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommend=
s that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to str=
ongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pak=
istan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Geo=
rgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that =
planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Ara=
bia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?=09For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate securit=
y recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent =
reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being question=
ed and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a re=
sult, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the Uni=
ted States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry th=
eir passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest=
 that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card=
 as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immi=
gration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National=
ity Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her "regi=
stration" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanen=
t Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Cros=
sing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not his=
torically been asking domestic travelers for "registration" documentation, =
but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it=
 would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c=
urrent lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corpor=
ate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

Jim -- Per our discussion, I gave Mary Flood the attorney numbers at Enron, mainly because she had credible research anyway and our number was actually a little lower. She also has a prominent lawyer in town quoted as saying that he has always viewed us as one of the major law firms in town, which is really all she needs.  My guess is we won't like this story, but it is very difficult to reel someone in on speculating about layoffs in one function when we all know what's coming companywide.

Thanks Jim.

There are about 245 attorneys employed in our legal department

I am not able to find anyone available for an interview today.  If you

Subject:	Dabhol -- Judicial Probe

Jim/Rob -

As Paul Kraske suggested in this e-mail today, I'm going to get Bill Lawler
from V&E involved in the India judicial probe analysis.  As you will
recall, Bill has helped us with the China problems and issues that came up
in India earlier this year (particularly charitable contributions) and more
recently with the criminal charges against Sanjeev relating to certain
quarry leases.

Let me know if you have any comments or objections to our involving Bill on
this issue.

Thanks,
Bruce

Subject:	L. Nagyte's resume



Dear Mr. Emilio Battioli,

I am an LL.M. candidate (August 2001) at the University of Michigan Law
School. I am very happy to have found the attorney in Enron Corporation who
has studied at the University of Warwick, the institution from which I have
graduated, too.

I have always been eager to practise law in a corporation and at the moment
I am looking for a job in the South of the US. Therefore, I have decided to
write to you contemplating that Enron Corporation may be interested in
utilizing my credentials.

As a native of Lithuania with a law and business degree from the University
of Warwick, I have had extensive international business and personal
experience in UK, Eastern Europe and Russia. I did an internship in Oil
Trading International and Legal Departments of BP Amoco PLC, London. I also
gained some corporate work experience when doing an internship in Harden &
Wells in Beijing. To gain further insight into corporate and securities
matters, I have focused on business related classes at the University of
Michigan Law School.

I would really appreciate if you had a look at my resume, which is attached
to this e-mail. Thank you ever so much.

Sincerely,
Lina Nagyte

I've instigated the following change:  instead of running the report to update the online corporate data sheets each weekend which frequently means that no data sheets are available until Monday, I've requested they be run on Thursday evening to be ready by Friday morning.  This way anybody working over the weekend will have the data sheets.  Of course we continue to be available for data not accessible through the data sheets.  Hope this helps a little.

Best regards
Kate

CONGRESS APPROVES SUPERFUND BILL TO PROMOTE DEVELOPMENT OF
BROWNFIELDS

The Senate approves a superfund reform bill that would
provide liability relief to small businesses and innocent
landowners, after a Wyoming senator withdraws his opposition
to the bill (H.R. 2869). The House had passed the measure
earlier in the day, which means the first major piece of
environmental legislation to clear Congress in 2001, a
measure designed to promote redevelopment of polluted
properties known as brownfields, is now ready for President
Bush's signature. The legislation also seeks to promote
redevelopment of brownfields sites by authorizing $250
million annually to fund assessment and cleanup activities.

REPORT FROM WHITE HOUSE EXPECTED ON FUEL ECONOMY CREDIT
TRADING

A Bush administration task force is looking to expand on a
recent National Academy of Sciences proposal to establish a
system of tradeable credits under the Corporate Average Fuel
Economy program, John Graham, chief regulatory official at
the White House, tells BNA. "Such a program would be less
costly than the current program and create a continuous
incentive for automakers to improve fuel economy," says
Graham. Under such a scenario, automakers could get credits
for achieving greater fuel economy standards than required
under the CAFE program and sell those credits to other
companies struggling to meet the standards. . . . Page A-1

WHITMAN SIGNS RULE TO MAKE HAZARDOUS WASTE CLEANUPS EASIER,
CHEAPER

EPA Administrator Whitman signs a final rule that will allow
companies to consolidate hazardous waste at remediation
sites without triggering the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act's strict waste management regulations. The
final Corrective Action Management Unit rule is expected to
make contaminated site cleanups easier and cheaper for
companies by allowing consolidation of waste for temporary
or permanent disposal. . . . Page A-6

EPA PETITIONED TO HALT USE OF TWO PESTICIDES USED TO TREAT
WOOD

Several environmental and public health groups petition EPA
to halt immediately the use of two pesticides used to treat
wood and are threatening to sue the agency if it fails to
suspend their use. The federal government has failed to act
to protect children from exposure to the wood preservatives
chromated copper arsenate and pentachlorophenol, according
to a statement from Beyond Pesticides/National Coalition
Against the Misuse of Pesticides, a Washington-based
organization, and the lead petitioner. . . . Page A-1

SENATE'S ANTI-TERRORISM BILL AUTHORIZES FUNDS FOR DRINKING
WATER SECURITY

The Senate passes an anti-terrorism bill that would
authorize a $50 million EPA program for drinking water and
wastewater security grants over six years. A similar bill
passed by the House authorizes $60 million for those
activities over the next five years. . . . Page A-2

COURT SAYS MASSACHUSETTS SUPERFUND LAW DOES NOT PRECLUDE
JURY TRIAL

A Massachusetts trial court finds the state's hazardous
waste law, which is modeled on the federal superfund
statute, does not preclude jury trials. In doing so, the
court declines to follow federal case law barring jury
trials in superfund cost recovery suits. . . . Page A-3

REGIONAL WATER BOARD DELAYS TOUGHER STANDARDS FOR ORANGE
COUNTY, CALIF.

The Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board decides
to postpone for one month action on a municipal stormwater
permit that proposes tougher standards for cities in Orange
County, Calif. Officials from many of the 24 cities in the
county asked for the delay to enable them to review
revisions in the five-year national pollutant discharge and
elimination system permit. . . . Page A-4

EPA FINDS 'DEFICIENCY' IN AIR PERMITTING PROGRAM OF
WASHINGTON, D.C.

The air permitting program in the District of Columbia does
not provide adequate public notice of permitting decisions
and does not comply with federal regulations under Title V
of the Clean Air Act, according to EPA. A "notice of
deficiency," published by EPA in the "Federal Register", is
a prerequisite for withdrawal of EPA approval for the
District's operating permit programs, but the director of
the air protection division in EPA Region III says D.C. is
not in danger of losing control of its air operating permit
program. . . . Page A-2

ENERGY TAXES: Belgium's six-month effort to negotiate an
agreement on an energy harmonization tax while holding the
European Union presidency ends in failure. As a result,
Belgium's Finance Minister says prospects for gaining
approval of the tax in 2002 are bleak. "This is another
setback for the EU and its efforts to implement and meet the
Kyoto Protocol targets on greenhouse gas reductions," says
an EU official. . . . Page A-6

Freeman, we represent Jani-King.  Their CEO was ordered to give a deposition in a case where he does not have unique or superior  knowledge of discoverable information. Our attempts to get it quash or obtain relief from the court of appeals and the Supreme Court have been unsuccessful.
This issue is of importance to the jurisprudence of the state because more and more CEO's are being requested to give depositions and there is confusion in the law as to what an apex deponent is required to state in the affidavit in order to trigger the apex deposition doctrine. Must the affidavit state that he/she does not have ANY knowledge of relevant facts, rather than saying that he/she does not have any UNIQUE OR SUPERIOR knowledge of relevant facts as the Supreme Court said in Alcatel USA ? 
At this point, our best chance in getting the court's attention is for the court to be flooded with amicus briefs requesting that the court take this case to resolve the conflict that exists among various courts of appeal. If the Supreme Court does not resolve the confusion that exist is the law at this time, litigants will continue to waste of time and money in fighting apex depositions. 
Can you please forward this email to your membership to see if anyone is interested enough to file a quick amicus brief?  If anyone is interested, they can contact me or Kirsten Castaneda (214-740-8533) or Gary Powell (214-740-8470) in our Dallas office. 
Time is of the essence as the motion for rehearing is due next Friday. 
If this is not the proper protocol, I would appreciate hearing from you.

Sorry, I gave a bum lead....... as the facts unfold, it looks like this deal relates to a Volumetric Production Payment transaction  and equity investment done out of Scott Josey's group...the properties involved are located in Utah and Colorado..............the "Crescendo entity" is managed by non-Enron personnel.  From my discussions with Scott Josey this a. m., it appears that Crescendo management has been using outside local counsel to determine the relative rights as between Crescendo who owns the oil and gas rights and Sullivan who holds the helium rights via a lease arrangement with the BLM............Andy Edison, as of this morning, is on-point according to Scott Josey....Scott Josey's group is an ENA group.
best regards   bng

The Crescendo project is a Northern Border project, and the appropriate contact for Christopher Sullivan (the fellow that left Jim the voice mail) is probably Janet Place.  I've left Janet a voice mail with the contact information on Sullivan and asked her to get ahold of him regarding his letter on the helium issue.  In case you access email ahead of voice mail Janet, the guy is Chistopher Sullivan, Rocky Mountain Helium, 1-800-945-1547.  Thanks all.  DF

John,
Here?s the CV of the lawyer that we referred to previously (it is
unfortunately in Spanish). Her field of specialization is Administrative
law. She currently works for the Municipality of La Plata, though she
may get a leave to do this job for us. I am concerned about this point.
If this is an obstacle that we could not overcome (I
 know you have asked the opinion of Jim Derrick about her), we may have
to look for another alternative as soon as possible.

Jim:  Im finalizing the SPA that will be going out to our shortlist of
final-round bidders in connection with the auction of our interest in
SK-Enron.  Currently, the definition of "Knowledge" as it relates to our
knowledge-qualified reps only includes the actual knowkedge of Jim Hughes
and Darrell Kinder.  For optical reasons, our bankers and corp. development
have suggested we broaden that group to include at least the actual
knowledge of the Enron-appointed directors of SK-Enron, which, of course,
would include you.  Although I realize you have not been intimately
involved with the goings-on at SK-Enron, Im checking if it would be ok with
you to be added to the list for the desired optics. Im happy to provide you
with the draft agreement (and the schedules once they are prepared) should
you desire.  Pls let me know.  Thanks.

Hi Jim,

I got your phone message and fully understand your need to be in Houston
next Friday.

We will of course reschedule the Executive Committee meeting from
November 2 to a later date.  The good news is that this will give us a
chance to pick a date far enough out to attract a better attendance.

Are there dates in December which you are confident will be available on
your schedule for the re-scheduled meeting?  I recommend that we follow
Anne McNamara's suggestion and float those dates now -- 5 to 7 weeks out
-- and pick the date most convenient to most members.

Shall I draft an e-memo from you stating that we want to re-schedule the
meeting to accommodate more members' schedules, and proposing dates for
them to tell us their availability?

Good luck with all the crocodiles and turkeys you're having to deal with
these days.

David

    Adjectives suitable for use on corporate email fail me in attempting to
describe this individual, whose animus, in my view clearly is at such a
level that it cannot possibly be disinterested.

<http://www.riskgrades.com/clients/thestreet/index.cgi?tickers=ENE>
problems won't go out the door with Andrew Fastow.


The finance chief, who was replaced Wednesday, came under scrutiny as the
executive who orchestrated and profited from a hedging deal that went sour,
saddling Enron with a $1.2 billion charge to equity. As details of this
deal, and  <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/detox/10002702.html> others,
have emerged over the past two weeks, Enron stock has collapsed, falling 54%
in just seven days.



  <http://www.thestreet.com/tsc/c.gif>
<http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/thestreet.com/markets;abr=!ie;mkts=detox;pti
le=2;sz=336x280;ord=080112?>  border=0 height="280" width="336">
<http://www.thestreet.com/tsc/c.gif>

Wednesday, the stock fell a further 17% on enormous volume, signifying that
once-faithful mutual fund holders were bailing. Also Wednesday, a raft of
once-friendly analysts downgraded the stock. Faced with betrayal on that
scale, Enron management at last felt compelled to act; a press release says
Fastow is taking a leave of absence. He's been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon,
formerly CEO of Enron's industrial markets group.


How might the Enron bulls spin this? Likely, they will point to McMahon's
alleged opposition to Fastow's role in the big hedging deal, called LJM2, to
show that the "Fastow era" is over. The Wall Street Journal, citing
anonymous sources, reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon
complained about Fastow's possible conflict of interest. Probably, the fear
was that Fastow couldn't serve Enron and LJM2 equally, especially as he was
allegedly making a lot of money from LJM2.


Clearly, if McMahon turns out to be a new broom, that's a positive for
Enron. An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journal's
account of McMahon's stance on LJM2 was correct.



Plunging
Investors not liking Enron here

  <http://images.thestreet.com/markets/detox/1425.gif>

Not much else is encouraging, however. Fastow's departure shows that it took
massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action. On a
difficult  <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/detox/10002864.html> conference
call Tuesday, CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding backing. It took
Wednesday's plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO. In other words, Lay
listens only when the market screams and hollers. How much further does the
stock have to fall to bring further much-needed reforms at the company?

The spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and
Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastow's replacement was
necessary to rebuild investor confidence.


Enron culture is thick with financial sorcery. People got upset by one
shadowy deal, but no one knows exactly how the company's core energy trading
business makes money. It's hard to believe the LJM2 deals were done in
isolation and without the knowledge of the board.


In fact, the chatter is that Fastow and Skilling proposed the LJM2
transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broadband
business. The board apparently feared the volatility that might come from
being in broadband, so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM2 as a way to hedge that
volatility away. This meant LJM2 entered agreements that gave it access to
increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from the
downside. Should the whole board be on the hook, too? The spokeswoman
responds that the board would not have entered the LJM2 transaction if it
had not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders.


Lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market's views.
Arguably, that's downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent
on potentially skittish short-term financing. Letting things get this bad
has risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers. It shows an
unhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they're unavoidable. The
spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve
transparency.


Any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated, but is it any wonder
people compare this lot to Long Term Capital Management?

We have received inquiries from several attorneys who attended only the Thursday session of the Enron Corp. Law Conference in San Antonio.  If you have not already contacted someone about CLE credit for Thursday,  please send an e-mail to Becky Zikes stating that you attended the Thursday session.  This will enable you to claim 3.50 hours total credit, with 1.25 hours ethics credit for Thursday.  If you have any questions, please contact Becky Zikes at 3-1843, or Diane Goode at 5-7103.   Please respond by Thursday, May 31 since we need to finalize our CLE filings with the various state bar organizations. 


If you wish to receive CPE credit (for certified public accountants) for the Law Conference, please  send an e-mail to Becky Zikes and we will get the appropriate certificate prepared.  Again, any questions should be directed to Becky Zikes at 3-1843, or Diane Goode at 5-7103. 

Thanks for your help.

WHITMAN SAYS ENVIRONMENT STILL PROTECTED DESPITE
ANTI-TERRORISM FOCUS

Despite taking on new responsibilities in response to the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, EPA will continue to ensure the
quality of the nation's air, water, and land is protected,
Administrator Whitman says in an interview with BNA. "We've
obviously had to reallocate, shift some resources and people
around in order to meet the responsibilities post-September
11th," Whitman says. But the various offices of EPA are
"continuing to do what they need to do. We're continuing to
work on the issues that are priorities." Whitman says the
agency is not diverting resources from high-priority
matters, like superfund cleanups, "but we've asked everyone
to go back and reprioritize and see if there are other
cleanups that are not very environmentally sensitive." . . .

U.S. COURT AFFIRMS CLASSIFICATION OF DIOXIN AS 'KNOWN' HUMAN
CARCINOGEN

The Department of Health and Human Services acted reasonably
in upgrading dioxin from a "reasonably anticipated" to a
"known" human carcinogen in the National Toxicology Program
list, according to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit. The court's decision is
expected to have major implications for EPA's ongoing
reassessment of the risks of dioxin. The agency hopes to
complete its final reassessment of dioxin early next year. .

found not guilty by a federal court jury in Dallas, Texas,
of charges that they falsified test data in order to meet
quality standards required by EPA. The lab analyzed samples
of air, liquids, soils, pesticides, explosives, and
nerve/chemical agents for consulting firms, engineering
companies, and federal, state, and local governments,
according to the Department of Justice. . . . Page A-2

EPA ENDS REVIEW OF FUMIGANT TELONE, SAYS BENEFITS OUTWEIGH
RISKS

EPA says it has ended a special review of cancer risks posed
by the fumigant telone, finding the pesticide's benefits
outweigh its risks. The fumigant is an alternative to methyl
bromide, which is being phased out under the 1987 Montreal
Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. . . .

COMMENT PERIOD EXTENDED ON WHOLE EFFLUENT TOXICITY TEST
METHODS

The comment period on a proposed rule updating methods for
measuring whole effluent toxicity in effluents and the
waters into which they are discharged is extended by EPA
until Jan. 11, 2002. The proposed rule would modify whole
effluent toxicity test procedures, which seek to
characterize effluent as a whole in terms of its toxic
effects on certain test species. . . . Page A-3

BESTFOODS FOUND NOT LIABLE FOR CLEANUP COSTS AT MICHIGAN
SUPERFUND SITE

A federal court finds Bestfoods Inc. is not liable for
superfund cleanup costs at the site of a chemical
manufacturing plant in Muskegon County, Mich. The U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Michigan decides
the Englewood, N.J.-based food-processing company is not
responsible for cleanup costs because Michigan and EPA
failed to prove the company, and not its subsidiary, Ott
Chemical Co., actually operated the plant. . . . Page A-8

WORK BLOCKED IN EFFORT TO TREAT SEWAGE GENERATED BY TIJUANA,
MEXICO

Millions of gallons of Tijuana wastewater continue to flow
daily from Mexico into the United States as bureaucratic
infighting, legal challenges, and international
complications stall efforts to achieve secondary treatment
levels. Litigation and infighting block what began as a U.S.
effort to help Mexico's state of Baja California clean the
wastewater its Tijuana River brings north and into U.S.
coastal waters. . . . Page A-6

Dear Mr. Derrick:

I wanted to share with you the most recent product development at EnTrust
Capital.  In response to feedback from our client base, we have developed a
Business Management Services division.

Our service can encompass many aspects of your daily life; check writing,
banking, bookkeeping, monthly reporting of expenditures, budgeting, payroll
services for household employees, analysis, reconciliation and recording of
brokerage activity, to name a few, and the cost for these services is
relatively negligible.  We will provide practical guidance on cash
management and investment of surplus funds in order to maximize interest
earned on excess cash balances.  We are also able to coordinate and interact
closely with your tax accountants (or recommend ones, if necessary) to help
plan for your income taxes and to make the preparation of your personal
income tax returns as painless as possible.

Our business management group consists of a small, but growing professional
staff, including a bookkeeper, certified public accountant and tax,
insurance and business consultants, all of whom are highly trained and
experienced in all facets of personal business management.  Their focus is
solely that of organizing and servicing our clients' daily business
management needs. Our insurance consultants can review, broker or underwrite
any of your insurance needs.  Furthermore, having a trusted "gatekeeper" to
coordinate and interact with all your professional advisors can help insure
that nothing gets overlooked.

Additionally, EnTrust has developed close working relationships with
attorneys and accountants specializing in trusts and estates, with whom we
can coordinate your estate planning in conjunction with your overall
investment objectives.  Furthermore, we offer brokerage account recording,
reconciliation, analysis and record keeping for your trusts and estates.

With EnTrust's business management group, not only can we help save you
time, headaches and simplify your daily life, but we can turn an oftentimes
disorganized "do-it-yourself" chore into a professional, systemized personal
business management success, at a low cost to you.  We view this newest
service as part of our overall and continuing goal of understanding and
meeting our clients' needs.

Please feel free to contact me at (212) 224-5503, or via email
tlevy@entrustcapital.com to arrange for a meeting or conference call to
evaluate how our Business Management Services may be able to help you manage
your personal finances more efficiently.

Regards,

Todd

Hi Jim,

Well, it's been quite a month!  I hope the dust is clearing for you a
little bit, at least.

The results of our email poll of Executive Committee members for our
inaugural meeting are as follows:

a)  Friday, January 11, 2002 -- all can make it except McNamara, Kryder
and (maybe) Green;

b)  Friday, January 18, 2002 -- all can make it except Kryder and
(maybe) Green;

c)  Wednesday, January 23, 2002 -- all can make it except (maybe) Green.

Shall we go ahead and nail down the meeting date and circulate it so the
folks can lock it in on their calendars?  What day do you choose?

Thank you so much for finding the time to manage this matter, as you
have, amid all the other matters on your plate.

David

HIGHLIGHTS

STATES GAIN FLEXIBILITY IN ADOPTING NUTRIENT CRITERIA FOR
WATER STANDARDS

States may be allowed some flexibility to meet a 2004
deadline for adopting nutrient criteria into water quality
standards if they can demonstrate a plan for meeting
specific milestones, EPA writes in final guidance on the
criteria. In addition, the guidance allows states to
prioritize the waters for which they need to develop
nutrient criteria and to use their own approach in the
process. Excessive nutrients lead to eutrophication, which
manifests itself as algal blooms. EPA says these blooms
result in low dissolved oxygen levels, fish kills, murky
water, and depletion of aquatic flora and fauna. . . . Page

CARBON MONOXIDE LIMITS RELAXED FOR LARGE MUNICIPAL WASTE
COMBUSTORS

EPA announces that it is extending from three hours to 15
hours the period, during two types of malfunctions, when
large municipal waste combustors are excused from compliance
with carbon monoxide emissions limits. The rule amends the
new source performance standards for large municipal waste
combustors issued in 1995, which required compliance with
emissions limits except during three-hour periods of
startup, shutdown, or malfunction. . . . Page A-1

HOUSE PANEL PROPOSES FUNDS TO ASSESS VULNERABILITY OF WATER
SUPPLY

A $20 billion anti-terrorism package proposed by the House
Appropriations Committee includes nearly $110 million, an
amount not requested by the White House, for immediate
drinking water vulnerability assessments by EPA.  The funds
would pay for both cyber and physical security assessments
that could begin as early as this year if the overall
spending bill is approved by Congress. . . . Page A-1

REPROCESSED URANIUM TO BE USED AS FUEL AT TVA POWER PLANT IN
ALABAMA

The Tennessee Valley Authority will enter an agreement with
the Energy Department to reprocess about 33 metric tons of
highly enriched uranium for use as fuel in an
electricity-generating power plant. Bruce L. Yeager, an
environmental policy specialist with TVA, says the
weapons-grade uranium will be converted to low-enriched
uranium for use at the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant in Athens,
Ala. . . . Page A-3

 GUIDANCE ON RISK ASSESSMENT FOR PESTICIDES EXPECTED IN
DECEMBER

Revised guidance explaining how the EPA is assessing
cumulative risks of the organophosphate pesticides will soon
be reviewed by the White House Office of Management and
Budget and is expected to be approved for release by early
December. This cumulative methodology guidance will coincide
with the expected Dec. 3 release of a preliminary cumulative
risk assessment of the organophosphates, says an advisor in
the Office of Pesticide Programs. . . . Page A-9

The U.S. recycling industry is a viable, well-established
business sector that is diverse and contributes
significantly to the economy, according to an EPA study.
EPA finds more than 56,000 recycling and reuse
establishments operating nationwide with annual gross
revenue of over $236 billion. . . . Page A-2

FRANCE ANNOUNCES IMMEDIATE BAN ON USE OF ARSENIC SALT IN
AGRICULTURE

The French Ministry of Agriculture announces an immediate
ban on the use of arsenic salts (sodium arsenates) in
agriculture. French winemakers use about 1.5 million liters
of arsenic salts annually to prevent the spread of fungus in
vineyards. The ministry points to a report on the
carcinogenic properties of arsenic salts. . . . Page A-6

WORLD BANK URGES CHINA TO INCREASE SPENDING ON ENVIRONMENT

China needs to increase its investment in environmental

EUROPEAN UNION
______________

CHEMICAL LABELING : The European Parliament endorses a more
stringent approach to regulating industrial chemicals that
would require chemical manufacturers to provide toxicity
data on their products before selling them, would mandate
labeling of products that contain hazardous substances, and
establish the public's right-to-know the results of toxicity
tests and whether those tests were conducted on animals.  .

http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/den.nsf/id/a0a4y5h2d0_

CLIMATE CHANGE: A European Union emissions trading scheme
should be voluntary in its initial phase and should include
all six of the greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto
Protocol instead of just carbon dioxide, says the Union of
the Electricity Industry, a trade association representing
producers of electricity in the EU. . . . Page A-4

http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/den.nsf/id/a0a4y5b2r1_

CARBON SINKS: Despite arguing for years against the use of
"carbon sinks" to offset greenhouse gas emissions, the
European Commission announces a method to verify the amount
of greenhouse gases taken up by forests that will play a
"fundamental role" in implementing the Kyoto Protocol. . . .

Bruce,

Herewith the bio(hagio)graphical details of Arthur Marriott QC from the
Debevoise & Plimpton website.

My experiences of Arthur Marriott QC as a presiding arbitrator are good. He
is not a lawyer of the same calibre as Lord Mustill or Andrew Rogers QC (nor
would he,I think,claim to be).  But he is very practical and knows what he
is doing.  He wants to get on with things where he can. He is also quite
adroit at managing tribunals. That is almost certainly going to prove to be
a necessary skill with Kamal Hossain who will see his role as advocating the
GOI's position and engineering whatever delay the GOI wants. I am hopeful
that (eventually) Kamal Hossain will overplay his hand,which will leave
us,in practical terms,with a Rogers-Marriott tribunal.

October 19, 2001

Dear National Member:

The National Program is continuing its conference call series on America's
Response to Terrorism, with Jonathan B. Tucker, Director of the Chemical
and Biological Weapons Nonproliferation Program at the Center for
Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) of the Monterey Institute of International
Studies, on Wednesday, October 24, 12:00 to 12:45 p.m. EDT.  Dr. Tucker
will lead the discussion on the Biological and Chemical Threat, and Michael
P. Peters, Senior Vice President of the Council on Foreign Relations, will
moderate.

Before joining CNS, Jonathan Tucker worked for the U.S. government for six
years. He served as an arms control fellow at the Department of State, an
analyst in the international security program at the Congressional Office
of Technology Assessment, a foreign affairs specialist in the office of
chemical/biological policy at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and
a senior policy analyst on the staff of the Presidential Advisory Committee
on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses. In February 1995, he worked as a
biological weapons inspector in Iraq under the auspices of the United
Nations Special Commission. He edited Toxic Terror:  Assessing Terrorist
Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons and wrote Scourge: The Once and
Future Threat of Smallpox (Atlantic Monthly Press, 2001).

Please respond to this e-mail if you would like to participate in the
conference call with Jonathan Tucker and Michael Peters, and we will send
you call-in instructions.  Please don't hesitate to call me at 212/434-9465
or e-mail me directly at ifaskianos@cfr.org if you have suggestions or
questions.

Regards,
Irina Faskianos
National Director
Council on Foreign Relations

Hi Bruce,
    That's where I was heading.  Either I save everything on the tapes or nothing.  I don't think anything pertaining to LJM is applicable here.
Thanks,
Mike

Mike -

While one paragraph states that normal destruction policies are suspended it states in the next paragraph to retain only ones related LJM.  My interpretation is "preserve anything to do with LJM and if you are unsure preserve anything you think is related to LJM until you can verify". 

Jim - This is an inquiry from our New York trading office.  


Thanks

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers
are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM
partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests
in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to
preserve documents that might be used in the litigation.

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended
immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings,
e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way
relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2,
including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any
transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and
Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a
requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil
and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the
meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with
anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

When I got in this morning, there was a note on my desk from Andy saying you wanted to meet with him this morning.  I am supposed to let him know when.

Thank you, Jim!  We need all the extra edge we can get in this tricky
fundraising climate.

Joyce Gillespie with The Lyons Foundation asked me to provide her a copy of
any letter that we send to the trustees.  Please adapt this letter to your
style and send to each of them w/carbon to:
Joyce Gillespie
The Lyons Foundation
1202 Dairy Ashford
Houston, Texas 77079-3004

Dear Jim/R.A. Seale,
I've been a member of Society for the Performing Arts for a number of years
and have enjoyed every minute.  The organization was founded in 1966 along
with the establishment of Jones Hall (construction began in 1964 under John
Jones/Houston Endowment leadership) and represents some of the finest
performers, dancers, musicians in the world.

We are appealing more broadly to our local foundations and need your help to
allow them to continue their fine outreach program.  As you can imagine, the
flooding of Jones Hall in June virtually devastated their offices and their
archives, but their outreach and education programs have continued due to
the staff's dedication to the arts.  They even managed to hang onto Mormon
Tabernacle Choir when Jones Hall was flooded by moving them over to Reliant
Hall.

Our city needs as much relief and beauty as we can muster in these difficult
times.  Thank you for strongly favoring this request.  Call Sally Tyler,
Director of Development, at 713-227-3384, if you need additional
information.

 W <http://graphics.nytimes.com/images/dropcap/w.gif> hat really went on in
some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen?

Wall Street has been puzzling over that since Enron ( news/quote
<http://www.nytimes.com/redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.m
arketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=ENE> ) released
its quarterly earnings a week ago. Yesterday shares in Enron plunged $5.40,
to $20.65, after the company said that the Securities and Exchange
Commission was looking into the transactions.

The reaction was in some ways puzzling. Given the questions that have been
raised since the earnings announcement - some of them prominently featured
in The Wall Street Journal - it was likely that the S.E.C. would begin a
preliminary inquiry.

Whether it will go farther than that is not clear, but if nothing else the
slide in Enron shares over the last week shows the hazards that can confront
a company that allows word of a major reduction in its balance sheet value
to dribble out. Enron's shares rose 67 cents, to $33.84, last Tuesday, as
investors first reacted to the earnings announcement. But since then they
have fallen $13.19, or 39 percent.

The $1.2 billion reduction in shareholders' equity was not mentioned in a
news release Enron issued on its quarterly earnings last Tuesday. It was
briefly mentioned in a conference call with analysts, but many of the
listeners seem to have not noticed that, wrongly thinking Kenneth L. Lay,
Enron's chairman and chief executive, was referring to a $1 billion
write-off that was disclosed in the earnings release.

When questions were asked in the following days, the explanations were less
than thorough. Enron explained that the reduction in shareholders' equity
was related to the termination of "structured finance vehicles" involving
partnerships that had been controlled by the company's chief financial
officer.

"Both the debt and the equity people are looking for more clarity about how
the company goes about its business," said Ralph Pellecchia, a credit
analyst at Fitch Investors Service. He added that the issue of the company's
"credibility related to this transaction really seems to have a life of its
own."

Enron declined yesterday to allow any officials to be interviewed about its
financial reports. But last night it said Mr. Lay would hold another
conference call with investors at 9:30 a.m. today.

The company's earlier disclosures regarding the partnerships baffled many
analysts. They referred to such things as "share settled costless collar
arrangements" and "derivative instruments which eliminated the contingent
nature of existing restricted forward contracts." The disclosures said the
company entered into the transactions "to hedge certain merchant investments
and other assets."

It appears that Enron was able to report profits from them, even though the
underlying assets included investments that declined in value. The Wall
Street Journal, citing reports the partnerships made to institutional
investors, has reported the partnerships did well enough to make large cash
distributions to their investors. Enron officials in recent days have
refused to discuss the arrangements in any detail.

One of the questions that the S.E.C. may look into is whether the
termination of those transactions should have been treated as a balance
sheet item, or whether it should have been taken as a loss that affected
reported earnings. An S.E.C. spokesman declined to comment.

Under accounting rules, a company's transactions in its own shares cannot
produce profits or losses, whatever the effect on cash flow. So a company
that sells its shares for $10 each, and buys them back at $50, or at $1,
will report no earnings effect. Enron said that the reduction to
shareholders equity, and a related reduction in notes receivable, "is the
result of Enron's termination of previously recorded contractual obligations
to deliver Enron shares in future periods."

Stephen Moore, an analyst with Moody's Investors Service who has put Enron's
debt on review for a possible downgrade, said that while some of the details
were not clear, "Essentially, Enron's promise was that a certain amount of
Enron's shares would be worth $1 billion. The shares plummeted, and they
were not" worth that much.

Enron emphasizes its own version of earnings, which leaves out some
expenses, and directs attention away from its balance sheet, which is
disclosed only in S.E.C. filings, not in the earnings news release. The
reduction in shareholders' equity would be shown only on the third-quarter
balance sheet, which has yet to be released.

Earlier this year, Jeffrey Skilling, then Enron's chief executive, reacted
strongly when a questioner on a conference call challenged the failure to
provide balance sheet numbers when earnings were released. He called the
questioner a common vulgarity that surprised many listeners. Mr. Skilling
later resigned for what he said were personal reasons and Mr. Lay, the
chairman and former chief executive, took back the latter title.

While Enron was riding high, its often difficult-to-understand reports were
generally seen as not being a problem. The company appeared to be the
dominant force in the business of energy trading, and to be able to produce
phenomenal profits. When Mr. Lay was reported as having played an important
role in formulating the Bush administration's energy policies, the aura was
only enhanced. In January, the shares traded for $84.

But now, with some of the company's ventures clearly having run into
problems, it appears that investors are growing less willing to accept the
company's reports. That the partnership transactions were disclosed at all
was because of the involvement of the chief financial officer, and some have
wondered if there might have been similar deals with others.

Mr. Lay has promised to make the company's financial reports easier to
understand, and last week's report was at first praised by some analysts for
doing just that.

In a news release yesterday, Mr. Lay said the company welcomed the S.E.C.'s
request for information. "We will cooperate fully with the S.E.C. and look
forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to
rest," he said.

Jim,

we are evaluating 3 metals assets acquisition opportunities: 

1. the Longview alumina smelter in Washington State

2. the Vanalco alumina smelter in Washington State

3. an Arco/BP aluminum rolling facility in Kentucky.

I would like to run with one external US firm on these deals (the 3 deals are at exactly the same preliminary stage and there will be some economies of scale to be had. Also consistency of approach is important). The firm also needs to have strong offices with metals expertise both in London and New York and preferably close to the facilities in question. 

The firm I believe can deliver these advantages is Shearman and Sterling. I have spoken to a couple of people in the Houston office about this to get their views.

I would be grateful for your confirmation that you have no objection to this.

Thanks very much Jim.

	I have now spoken with the following people in doing further due diligence:

	1.  Theresa Bushman.  Theresa tells me that she shares the view with Mariner's GC that it would be helpful to have F&J continue to represent Mariner for the time being, given F&J's knowledge of Mariner's corporate history.  Theresa, if I have mischaracterized what you told me, please respond.

	2.   Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner's GC.  Kelly advised me recently that she has a new corporate matter of some urgency that she wants to retain F&J to handle, subject to your approval.  Kelly told me that she would be contacting you about this.

	3.   Prof. John Dzienkowski of the University School of Law.   John has given me his informal thoughts over the telephone on the ethical issues, based on hypotheticals I presented to him; of course, these are not to be taken as recommendations.  In a nutshell, John thinks it would be problematic for a law firm to unilaterally withdraw from the representation of a corporate client solely and only to be able to take on more business potentially adverse to that client in the future.  John thinks it might be appropriate to ask for a disgorgement of fees paid under these circumstances.

	4.  Uriel Dutton.  Dutton says that with an appropriate waiver letter, F&J would be willing to continue its representation of Enron and the Enron subsidiaries, including Mariner and the proposed new Mariner matter, conditioned on the following:

	a.  F&J could not continue to represent Corp. on  one of the three IP matters, which is the nonprovisional patent application (although Dutton was not specific, I believe F&J lists it as the "Method and System for the Determination of VAR").

	b.  F&J would continue to represent Corp. on the six or so abestosis matters in order to try and get Corp. dismissed, but with the understanding that if dismissal was not available, that new representation would be obtained by Corp. before trial.

	c.  Dutton will be sending over a draft proposed waiver letter for our consideration.   We told Dutton that we anticipated getting back to him on this matter early next week.  Although Dutton will be out of the office next week, he will be reachable by cell phone.

	Proposed going forward strategy:

	Chuck and I suggest that if an acceptable waiver letter can be fashioned, that we proceed with proposal offered by F&J.  We invite comments.

	Britt

Given that the Xcelerator has been returned to Corporate from EWS, would you like me to continue to use Haedicke's group for legal support, or is there someone in corporate I should speak with instead?

Thanks.

Please accept Mark Evans' apologies, he will be on vacation tomorrow and therefore unable to join the scheduled weekly conference call.

Mark requested that I ask you if you would like one of the senior lawyers from our department, eg., Justin Boyd, Paul Simons or Marcus Von Bock to join the call in his absence?

Many thanks

Jim:  Thanks for forwarding this to me---this helps me with our ongoing (seemingly daily!) disclosure issues.  Considering the confidential nature of these litigation memos, and the fact that Andy probably doesn't know who the heck I am(and probably doesn't care!), would you ask him to include me on his distribution list?  I think he will be more comfortable getting the request from you.  Thanks, Rex.

After all that has happened was wondering what your thoughts were about our
Christmas plans. We are a little unsure about New York. Not afraid simply
wondering if it was still what we should be doing or even want to do. Really
haven't come to any conclusions and wondered what your thoughts are?

Jim and Rob,
 
I hope you are both doing well. I realize that you must both be extremely busy with other more important issues but I find myself in a position that I HAVE to raise the issue described in the email below to your direct attention. The email is self explanatory but the bottom line is that not only has Enron failed to make payments that are due to me and to one of my companies for MONTHS now but  the company is not even responding to my requests for information.
 
I would highly appreciate it if you advised me on the best way to handle this, i.e WHO do I need to talk to who has the decision authority to make the payments and give me answers. I stress once more that the unjustified delays by Enron in making these payments is already causing me serious  problems and potential losses.
 
I look forward to your response.
 
Thanks and hope to see you soon.
 
Diomedes.

Subject: Enron payments
 
Mary Joyce,
 
I hope all is well with you. 
 
I am contacting you regarding a number of late payments by Enron which have now become urgent from my standpoint. These payments refer to contractual obligations between ECI (one of my affiliate companies) and Enron and to the Employment Contract between Enron and myself. The payments have been invoiced and they are months late now.
 
After questioning John Novak about the status of these payments (after leaving Enron I was told by Rob Walls to send all invoices related to the ECI and to my agreement with Enron to John Novak in Enron South America) I received a voice mail from Pam Buttler, who I believe works with you, informing me that I would have to wait until early November, maybe even until late November as the "changes in management at Enron require that all contracts be reviewed by the Compensation Committee which would convene in early or late November". 
 
As soon as I received this message last Wednesday I left a message with Pam and also a voice mail with you and I subsequently left two messages with your assistant asking you to contact me urgently regarding this very serious matter but as I have not heard from you I am writing this email to make sure that my position is clear.
 
These payments are due by Enron based on existing contracts and I see no reason why I have to wait for a review by an internal Compensation Committee. These payments are already significantly late and I have been extremely patient with continuous delays in payments due to me by Enron up to now. Moreover I have repeatedly let Enron know that I am in the process of closing a transaction which depends on receiving these payments, otherwise I would incur costs by unwinding other positions that I have. I need these payments to be made no later than Wednesday, October 24.
 
Please inform me of Enron's intents so that I can take all the appropriate steps to enforce my contractual rights.
 
I look forward to hearing from you,
 
Regards,
 
 
Diomedes Christodoulou.

Dear Mr. Derrick:
I am Director of Marketing and Sales of Mobious Solutions, a company that specializes in the discovery and production of electronic evidence.
Kindly permit Mobious to perform a demonstration for you of a fully automated process by which to separate and produce responsive, non-responsive and privileged electronic documents (with special emphasis on e-mail)in the event of a "2nd Request" production of documents mandated by the federal government in Enron's merger with Dynegy.
Mobious' method is enormously expeditious and has saved corporate entities thousands, hundreds of thousands and even millions of dollars.
Sincerely,
Bob Eisenberg

MONITORING RECOMMENDED IN EPA GUIDANCE ON WATER POLLUTION
REPORTS

Recommendations to states for doing biological monitoring to
determine whether a water body is impaired and requires a
total maximum daily load of pollutants is contained in final
guidance released by EPA. The "2002 Integrated Water Quality
Monitoring and Assessment Report Guidance" calls on states
to develop a comprehensive monitoring and assessment
strategy describing their approach to obtaining data used to
characterize the attainment status of their waters. The
final guidance, developed by EPA's Office of Wetlands,
Oceans and Watersheds in the agency's Office of Water does
not differ substantially from draft guidance circulated last
month. . . . Page A-1,  Text E-1

STAFF SAYS TECHNOLOGY TO MEET NONROAD DIESEL RULES
AVAILABLE, FEASIBLE

Current technology makes it feasible for heavy-duty diesel
engine manufacturers to meet the most stringent emission
standards in place for engines that are more or less than 50
horsepower, according to EPA staff. This finding, announced
in a technical staff paper open for public comment, sets the
agency up to enter the next phase of nonroad diesel engine
regulation--more stringent standards for these engines and
their diesel fuel, says an EPA official in the Office of
Transportation and Air Quality. . . . Page A-8

NATURAL GAS, PIPELINE INDUSTRIES SEEK LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE
SAFETY

Leading natural gas and liquid pipeline industry groups urge
the Bush administration to press Congress to pass
legislation to improve pipeline safety. In a letter to
Transportation Secretary Mineta, industry officials say a
working group of leaders from liquid pipeline, natural gas
transmission, and natural gas distribution companies "has
reached consensus on numerous issues that promote the
continued safety and reliability of the nation's pipelines."

U.N. REPORT TARGETS SEWAGE TREATMENT AS TOP PRIORITY TO
PROTECT OCEANS

A United Nations Environment Program report cites poorly
planned coastal development, sewage flows, and excessive
nutrients from industrial and agricultural runoff as the
most serious problems associated with ocean pollution. The
report was prepared for a meeting next week in Montreal of
the organization's Global Program of Action for the
Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-Based
Activities. . . . Page A-3

PESTICIDE MAKERS GET MORE TIME FOR AIR POLLUTION
PRECOMPLIANCE PLANS

Pesticide active ingredient makers will get three more
months to submit precompliance plans for hazardous air
pollutant emissions limits under a final rule being
published today by EPA. A separate final rule also being
published today changes the definition of "process tank" for
pesticide makers as part of the settlement of a lawsuit
filed by an industry group. . . . Page A-2

EPA PROPOSES TO ALLOW CERTAIN HAZARDOUS WASTES TO BE SENT TO
LANDFILLS

EPA proposes a rule that would allow, under limited
conditions, hazardous waste eligible for placement in
Corrective Action Management Unit sites to be disposed of in
federally regulated hazardous waste landfills. Several
industry groups had pushed to have the proposed change
included in an EPA rule proposed last year that addressed
Corrective Action Management Unit sites and had sought to
make it easier for industries to clean up hazardous waste
sites. EPA issues this separate, new proposed rule
addressing off-site shipment of some wastes as a result of
those comments on last year's proposal. . . . Page A-4

REVISIONS TO VERMONT WETLANDS RULES RELAX REQUIREMENTS FOR
DEVELOPERS

Revised wetland rules that would loosen some regulatory
requirements on developers are expected to be adopted in
Vermont next month. The rules would streamline the wetlands
review process in Vermont and ease regulatory burdens for
routine development activities. But the rules also would
provide added protection for Class I wetlands, already the
most protected category of wetlands. . . . Page A-5

EPA DRAFT POLICY EVALUATES PESTICIDE EXPOSURE THROUGH
DRINKING WATER

EPA plans to release today for public comment a draft policy
to explain how it will implement the Food Quality Protection
Act of 1996 requirement to evaluate exposures to pesticides
through drinking water. Under the policy, absent evidence to
the contrary, the agency says it will not generally conclude
that drinking water treatment would reduce exposures to a
pesticide. . . . Page A-6

WATER BOARD REJECTS INDUSTRY APPEALS ON SAN DIEGO STORMWATER
RULE

The California Regional Water Quality Control Board rejects
the appeals of the San Diego Building Industry Association
and the Western State Petroleum Association to block a plan
for the regulation of stormwater runoff in the San Diego
region. . . . Page A-8

spent nuclear fuel in dry storage at power plants. . . .

INTERNATIONAL TRADE
___________________

WTO: The European Union assures the United States it will
not promote the use of the "precautionary principle" to
justify the imposition of illegitimate trade barriers in
negotiations expected next year to clarify the relationship
between World Trade Organization rules and multilateral
environmental agreements, such as the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species and the Cartagena
Protocol of Biosafety. U.S. officials say the commitment was
made in a letter from the EU Trade Commissioner during the
recent meeting of trade ministers in Doha, Qatar. The
ministers agreed in Doha to launch a new round of
multilateral trade talks that will include discussions on
the relationship between WTO rules and "specific trade
obligations" set out in multilateral environmental
agreements. . . . Page A-3

      We need to advise the Executive Committee members that the

      Shall I send the memo below (after you've added the dates you

Freeman, we represent Jani-King.  Their CEO was ordered to give a deposition in a case where he does not have unique or superior  knowledge of discoverable information. Our attempts to get it quash or obtain relief from the court of appeals and the Supreme Court have been unsuccessful.
This issue is of importance to the jurisprudence of the state because more and more CEO's are being requested to give depositions and there is confusion in the law as to what an apex deponent is required to state in the affidavit in order to trigger the apex deposition doctrine. Must the affidavit state that he/she does not have ANY knowledge of relevant facts, rather than saying that he/she does not have any UNIQUE OR SUPERIOR knowledge of relevant facts as the Supreme Court said in Alcatel USA ? 
At this point, our best chance in getting the court's attention is for the court to be flooded with amicus briefs requesting that the court take this case to resolve the conflict that exists among various courts of appeal. If the Supreme Court does not resolve the confusion that exist is the law at this time, litigants will continue to waste of time and money in fighting apex depositions. 
Can you please forward this email to your membership to see if anyone is interested enough to file a quick amicus brief?  If anyone is interested, they can contact me or Kirsten Castaneda (214-740-8533) or Gary Powell (214-740-8470) in our Dallas office. 
Time is of the essence as the motion for rehearing is due next Friday. 
If this is not the proper protocol, I would appreciate hearing from you.

jim,  thankyou most graciously for the help.  i share your philosophy that you "try to support the lawyers in our community."  i feel i too give that support through my active presence as a member of the boards/executive committees of the federal bar association, south texas chapter (vice president), american inns of court, garland walker inn (secretary), american bar association, section of litigation (co-chair of cle)  and of course the ut law school executive committee.

we would like to contact chuck cheek as well (we do have an oil and gas practice) and i would appreciate your giving him a "heads up" that jerry swonke or i will contact him.   thanks.    best regards,  roger

Attached are two versions of a press release.  We plan to issue one of these before market open tomorrow.  The second version assumes financial close on the remainder of the secured credit facility (I need someone to confirm or deny).  The first version speaks only to the merger and our debt restructuring efforts.  Please review and provide comments as soon as possible to me and Karen Denne (karen.denne@enron.com).  I understand that Jeff McMahon and Jimmy Lee will discuss the attached at 7:00 CST tomorrow.

Ken:

Pete van de Gohm and I attended the NPC meeting in Washington on June 6 where the final draft Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) subcommittee document was presented to the Secretary of Energy and the NPC membership.  The draft document was accepted and the final document is being prepared.

At your request, we are pleased to continue working with Archie Dunham and the NPC subcommittee to attack the next phase of the project, the development and implementation of an Information Sharing and Analysis Center, or ISAC.  The ISAC will be the tool in providing threat information to the industry and is the main focus of the CIP project.

This next phase may require the involvement of an Enron attorney and a business lead as the ISAC will likely take the form of an LLC or similarly structured entity.  We will address these as the need arises with Jim Derrick and Steve Kean.

We feel we have made a great contribution to the energy industry by moving this project forward, and we are eagerly looking forward to our continued involvement.

Regards,

Mike Hicks

Subject:	RE: Crescendo

Sorry, I gave a bum lead....... as the facts unfold, it looks like this deal relates to a Volumetric Production Payment transaction  and equity investment done out of Scott Josey's group...the properties involved are located in Utah and Colorado..............the "Crescendo entity" is managed by non-Enron personnel.  From my discussions with Scott Josey this a. m., it appears that Crescendo management has been using outside local counsel to determine the relative rights as between Crescendo who owns the oil and gas rights and Sullivan who holds the helium rights via a lease arrangement with the BLM............Andy Edison, as of this morning, is on-point according to Scott Josey....Scott Josey's group is an ENA group.

The Crescendo project is a Northern Border project, and the appropriate contact for Christopher Sullivan (the fellow that left Jim the voice mail) is probably Janet Place.  I've left Janet a voice mail with the contact information on Sullivan and asked her to get ahold of him regarding his letter on the helium issue.  In case you access email ahead of voice mail Janet, the guy is Chistopher Sullivan, Rocky Mountain Helium, 1-800-945-1547.  Thanks all.  DF

Dear National Member:

The National Program conference call series on America's Response to
Terrorism continues next week, Wednesday, October 31, from 12:00 to 12:45
p.m. ET.  Sumit Ganguly, Professor of Government and Asian Studies at the
University of Texas at Austin, will lead a discussion on India and Pakistan
in the War on Terrorism and Michael P. Peters, Senior Vice President of the
Council on Foreign Relations, will chair.

Dr. Ganguly is author of the forthcoming book Fearful Symmetry: Explaining
the Indo-Pakistani Conflict.  He will focus on the risks and opportunities
that the United States now faces in South Asia, and how relations between
India and Pakistan will affect the United States in the war on terrorism.

Please respond to this e-mail if you would like to join us for the
conference call with Sumit Ganguly and Michael Peters, and we will send you
call-in instructions.  Please don't hesitate to call me at 212/434-9465 or

questions.

Regards,
Irina Faskianos

	Chuck and I just got off the phone with Uriel Dutton about F&J's representation.  F&J's key concern appears to be a potential ethical conflict that may arise if (a) F&J continues to represent Enron Corp., as it is currently doing with respect to IP matters and some asbestosis litigation and (b) F&J is tendered litigation or arbitration adverse to Enron Corp, even if substantially unrelated to the current matters.  Dutton confirmed that he was aware of no such litigation or arbitration having been tendered to F&J.  

	Dutton advises that while under the Texas rules of ethics, outside counsel can represent a party adverse to an existing client if the matters are not substantially related, that is not necessarily true if the matter is in federal court in Texas or brought in the courts of other states.  Further, even if a client such as Enron Corp. is willing to give an advance general ethical waiver, without knowledge of what future adverse matters F&J may take on, such "blind waivers (my term)" are often not upheld.  Dutton believes, however, that with respect to matter handled for former clients, it is generally the rule everywhere that there needs to be a "substantial relationship" between the matters for any potential ethical bar to arise.  In other words, it sounds like F&J wants to remove at least Enron Corp. from its list of current clients as soon as reasonably possible.

	Dutton did say that with respect to the other F&J matters, the bulk of which are related to Mariner, there may be some accommodation that may be reached.  Dutton will speak further with his colleagues and get back with us.  I will call Prof. Dzienkowski at the UT School of Law (our speaker for many years at the Unit CLE ethics seminar) and see if I can get some free advice about these issues.  I will of course only be speaking hypothetically.

	I will keep you advised.

	Britt

Today, the Corporate Secretary Department began receiving large amounts of registered mail which already has been signed for in the mailroom and delivered to us.  Chuck Cheek tells us that his Litigation Group should not receive these letters and will not be directly involved. 

We are just trying to ascertain to whom (individual/department/outside counsel) should this mail be directed.  

When we get an answer, we will pass the word and give the mailroom proper instructions.  It is my understanding that many of the officers on 50 also are receiving these letters.  We will need to notify all of the proper procedure.  

Let me know, and we'll take it from there.

thanks for the email regarding your german hire.  i'm in london this week on a number of different items and it occurred to me that they have a german lawyer in germany and a german lawyer in london.  do you think it would be a good idea to talk to one of the enron europe german lawyers about her or alternatively have one of them interview her in german?  let me know what you think.

Personal & Confidential

Gentlemen:

Attached are NPW drafts of the Form 8-K and Press Release.

Marc Manly called this evening to indicate that he will try to get Business Review Committee (BRC) sign-off on the Transaction by the end of the day tomorrow (hopefully earlier), followed by a short NPW Board meeting or, in lieu thereof, the circulation of a Unanimous Written Consent.  I questioned whether the Enron directors should recuse themselves from the Board meeting ( I believe they should do so, although they could be present for quorum purposes) and how any recusal would affect a Consent (in lieu of a Board meeting).  Joe, do you have any thoughts here, given the circumstances.  In addition, Marc and I have signed-off on the BRC resolutions (which are being circulated for execution), and I will review tonight the latest draft of the Board resolutions that I just received.

I am providing a copy of this E-Mail to Mark Koenig for his information from an Enron IR perspective.

Regards,
Robert

Robert:

     I attach the current versions of a form 8-K and associated press
release, assuming the Business Review Committee and the Board approve the
transactions.  Gene is reviewing these documents and may have additional
comments.  Please provide any comments and I will recirculate another draft
reflecting all comments received.  As indicated in the 8-K, we would intend
to include the press release as a filed exhibit to the 8-K.

     We are attempting to finalize the underlying deal documents tonight so
that they may be submitted to the BRC.  Unless there is a problem with
using resolutions by unanimous consent (e.g., the Enron directors must
recuse themselves and thus the resolutions can only pass by means of a live
board meeting), we are tending toward board action by unanimous consent.
We will explore if that is a problem, and if so, will call a telephonic
meeting at the earliest time we can obtain a quorum.

                                   Marc

Dear Friends,

It has been more than a month since our lives were changed. September 11 has taken a terrible toll.  The size of that toll remains to be seen. The College has responded in a way to make all of us proud.  Students, faculty and staff have banded together and given of themselves in an effort to cope with this tragedy.  Nearly 12,000 of us gathered on the South Mall to participate in a moving ceremony of sympathy and resolve. We are changed but not detained from our purpose-to educate one another and thereby to try to make sense of the world in which we find ourselves. Teaching young people is a wonderful balm.

We have all been touched by the catastrophic actions in New York, Washington, DC, and Pennsylvania--some more directly than others. Here on campus, we have been struggling to return to our normal lives while we serve as a source of strength and reason for our students, as well as for each other. I hope this finds you and your family safe and well.

TARL LAUNCHES NEW WEBSITE
For those of you with an interest in Texas history, you'll be pleased to see a new public education website, Texas Beyond History, that has been launched by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL). The new website can be found at http://www.utexas.edu/research/tarl/tbh/index.html, and showcases information and images about Texas cultural heritage-more than 13,000 years of human history-from Clovis to cotton farmers. For the first time, the public, especially school children and teachers, will have access to the most important of TARL's scientific holdings through online virtual museum "exhibits" and a variety of creative resources including map tools, children's activities, an illustrated glossary and lesson plans. This is the first website of its kind anywhere in the country.

FACULTY
As always, we are very proud of the achievements of our faculty. Here are just a few of the newsworthy announcements on that front.
** CATHARINE ECHOLS, OF THE PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT, has been appointed to serve as a member of the Biobehavioral and Behavioral Processes Study Section of the National Institutes of Health.
** R. J. HANKINSON, OF THE PHILOSOPHY DEPARTMENT, has been selected as editor of "Apeiron: A Journal for Ancient Philosophy and Science."
 You may have also seen several faculty members on national television lately:
** LIZA SHAPIRO OF ANTHROPOLOGY appeared in the PBS series "Evolution" on Sept. 25.
** JULIET WALKER, A NEW PROFESSOR OF HISTORY, was a guest on "Larry King Live" on Sept. 4 to discuss her upcoming book on Oprah Winfrey.
** SUMIT GANGULY, GOVERNMENT AND ASIAN STUDIES, has been on CNN, "Marketplace," "The News Hour," and many international radio and print media discussing the political situation in Pakistan and India.
** HOWARD MILLER, OF THE HISTORY DEPARTMENT, has been awarded the Liberal Arts Council Teaching Award. The recipient of this award, in recognition of excellence in teaching, is chosen by student members of the Council.
** WILLIAM GOETZMANN, AMERICAN STUDIES, will receive a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Texas Book Festival on Nov. 17. First Lady Laura Bush is scheduled to present the award to Prof. Goetzmann in the House Chambers of the Texas House of Representatives. You can find more information about the Festival at http://www.austin360.com/local/partners/texasbookfestival/.
** PAUL WOODRUFF, PLAN II AND PHILOSOPHY, recently had two books published, "Reverence" and a translation of Sophocles' "Antigone."

THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST
Our students are making the news as well. The October issue of "Glamour" magazine features RICHA GULATI as one of the Top 10 College Women of 2001. Richa is a Plan II major and a winner of the Truman Scholarship. In addition, Richa and fellow Liberal Arts student ANDREW FRIEDBERG, a Government/Economics/Finance major, were honored as the University's Outstanding Students for this academic year.

We are also very pleased to announce this year's winners of the Larry Temple Scholarship. RICHARD COFER II, History and Government major, and MARGARET PORTER, Liberal Arts Honors, are the recipients of this award. Another recent scholarship winner is FRANCISCO JOSE BENAVIDES. Francisco, majoring in Italian and English, is one of only two winners of a scholarship from the Italian American Foundation.

On Oct. 20, the Texas Exes awarded their Distinguished  Alumnus Awards for 2001 (http://www.texasexes.org/news.php3?id=56), and no less than five of the six honorees hold Liberal Arts degrees:

R. Gordon Appleman (BA '59)
Betty Sue Flowers (BA '69, MA '70)
Ricardo Hinojosa (BA '72)
Joe R.  Long  (BA '51)
and
Jon P. Newton (BA '63)

On the same evening, Prof. William S. Livingston,  Senior  Vice President of The University, Professor  of  Government, former Acting President of The University, was awarded the Distinguished Service Award by the Exes (http://www.texasexes.org/press.php3?pr=4).  This is only the second time that this award has  been made.

Congratulations to each of these distinguished alums, friends, and colleagues.


UT MYTHOLOGY
One of the recurring myths about UT is that the classes are all huge.  Here is the breakdown on class size in the College of Liberal Arts for this semester:

Enrollment	Number	Percent
1-30		936	74%
31-75		170	13%
76-100		51	4%
100-200		55	4%
Over 200	56	4%
Total		1268	100%

We are working hard to reduce the number of classes with more than 75 students, but we are proud of the fact that nearly three-fourths of our classes have 30 students or less.

Let us hear from you.

Jim, did Ken get a chance to discuss this expense report with you?  It is mainly for late charges to an American Express bill that Andy was late paying.  He and I both felt it was the principal of the charges that neither of us really wanted to approve.

Thanks.

Rosie

p.s.  If he didn't get a chance, I will be happy to print out for you.

new member recruitment drive and the reorganization of the IOGEC.  This
matrix is "Tab 1" on the agenda.

These documents, as well as the others identified on the agenda, will be

I wanted to give you an opportunity to "read up" in advance.

I look forward to seeing you in Houston on Friday.

Rob Stern of the law firm of O'Melvey & Meyers is here representing Jeff Skilling and requesting access to ENE Board/Committee minutes and Agenda files.   My feeling is that we will provide him access as we have provided to other outside law firms representing Directors and Officers.    Just wanted to confirm that with you.

We have heard from many of you regarding the attached request.  This e-mail=
 lets you know suggested recipients to date.  It also confirms that (i) the=
 current goal is to ascertain whether a change of ownership of either Enron=
 Corp. or Enron North America Corp. will cause contract breaches, defaults =
or terminations resulting in material liabilities and (ii) the timetable is=
 as soon as possible.  Preliminary responses early this week (subject to fu=

	Jim,

	I wanted to give you advance notice that the referenced matter could go to trial sometime during the week of October 22, 2001. This is a wrongful termination suit (sex discrimination/hostile work environment) which was filed on December 30, 1999.  Plaintiff seeks back pay, front pay and compensatory damages.  The case does not present substantial exposure to the company as Plaintiff's backpay claim is less than $20,000 and I believe that the likelihood of her recovery of frontpay or compensatory damages is remote, because she quit a job with Halliburton just a few months ago and because there simply is no evidence that she suffered compensatory damages since her discharge from EES. 

	The case is pending before Judge Patrick Mizell. Before he proceeds with the trial, the court will have to rule on the pending motions for summary judgment, which we have filed on behalf of EES and which could very well dispose of this case. Plaintiff has not timely responded to the motions. Last week, the court allowed Plaintiff's counsel to withdraw from the case, but the court assured me that he would not postpone the trial or the hearing on the pending motions. Plaintiff has indicated that she intends to hire replacement counsel, but to date no appearance has been made on her behalf.  I anticipate that she will be appearing pro se before the court.  The hearing on the motion is set for October 22, 2001 and I think there is a good chance that the MSJ will be granted. 

	Despite several attempts over the last three months to explore pretrial resolution of this matter, Plaintiff has refused to make a settlement demand or even meet with an EES human resource representative to discuss settlement. Her unwillingness to even discuss settlement is part of the reason that her former attorneys withdrew from the case. I fully expect that we will be required to take this matter through trial if the court does not rule in our favor on the pending motions. We have made the appropriate arrangements with witnesses so that if necessary, we will be ready to go next week. We are listed third or fourth on the trailing trial docket.

	I will keep you advised of any further developments. Please contact me if you have any questions.

Per our earlier discussion, I recommend changing the second sentence in Jeff's quote to:  "We firmly believe that Dabhol's contract. . ."  Please call if you would like to discuss.  Thanks.

Subject:	Erroneous press

Mark, I'm sure you are aware of the comments in the press that I have copied and inserted here below.  There have been others that are similar.  Basically, the press is reporting that we have dissolved the LJM partnerships, ended all relationships with the LJM entities, etc.  All that we have done is unwind the raptor entities, LJM still exists, all other transactions with LJM still exist, it's just that Andy sold his interest in the partnerships.  Michael Kopper owns them and would probably be considered a "friend of Enron" by investors/journalists.

I'm concerned about our efforts to build back investor confidence - do we correct the press?  how do we address this?  I'm concerned that we will once again be hit with credibility concerns when the press or investors fully understand that LJM still exists and we have deals still pending with it and have deals still in place with it.  How do we correct this erroneous press?   Sherron Watkins

Excerpts:
"Enron  has been under fire since last week as questions have surfaced about its accounting practices, especially in regard to two limited partnerships created by Fastow in 1999 and since dissolved. ...." By Lisa Sanders , CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 10:05 AM ET Oct. 25, 2001

EPA ISSUES RULE TO PROTECT DRINKING WATER FROM MICROBIAL
CONTAMINATION

EPA Administrator Whitman signs a final rule requiring
drinking water systems to install controls preventing the
backwash of recycled water from filter rinsing. The rule is
designed to prevent microbial contamination of drinking
water. Issued under the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments
of 1996, the Filter Backwash Recycling Rule will apply to
more than 4,600 large and small water systems that serve
about 35 million Americans, according to EPA.  "Today, I am
taking steps to better protect America's drinking water from
microbial contaminants, such as Cryptosporidium," Whitman
says. . . . Page AA-1

BUSH PLEDGES TO UPHOLD MORATORIUM ON OIL DRILLING OFF
CALIFORNIA COAST

President Bush says he will continue a moratorium on new
leases for oil and gas drilling off the California coast.
"Mr. Governor, I will honor my commitment to you to uphold
the moratorium on new drilling leases off the coast of
California," Bush says in Los Angeles. Former President Bush
imposed a moratorium on drilling in offshore areas of
California in 1990, and President Clinton extended the
moratorium until June 2012. . . . Page A-2

WHITMAN REVIEWING PROPOSAL TO CUT PAPERWORK BURDEN OF WASTE
RULES

EPA Administrator Whitman is said to be reviewing a proposed
rule to reduce the paperwork burden imposed by hazardous
waste regulations. Examples of the changes in the proposal
are the reduction of hazardous waste tank inspections and
the elimination of certain notices under the Land Disposal
Restriction rules. A final rule is not expected until late
next year. . . . Page A-1

prison a father and son who pleaded guilty to conspiracy
charges to distribute dichlorodifluoromethane gas (CFC-12)
and to evade some $7 million in federal excise tax on the
ozone-depleting refrigerant. Aurelio Vigna is sentenced to
24 months in prison and his son, Joseph Vigna, to 18 months
in prison. The judge also orders them to pay a combined
$750,000 to the IRS and to resolve all civil tax liability.

PAINT COMPANIES TO PAY $800,000 FOR CLEANUP OF BALTIMORE
SUPERFUND SITE

Four paint companies agree in a proposed settlement to pay
$800,000 to EPA for the costs of cleaning up a former
industrial superfund site in Baltimore. Under the proposed
settlement in federal court, Jotun A/S and Jotun Marine
Coatings Inc. will pay EPA nearly $200,000, and Ameron
International Corp. and the Valspar Corp. will pay a total
of $600,000 to reimburse the agency for removal activities
performed on the Ainsworth Paint & Chemical Co. superfund
site in Baltimore. . . . Page A-3

U.S. INDUSTRY DERAILS APPROVAL OF INTERNATIONAL SYMBOL FOR
CHEMICAL RISK

The International Labor Organization's Working Group on the
Harmonization of Chemical Hazard Communication fails to
agree on a proposed international sign for identifying
chemical hazards after objections are raised by the U.S. air
transport industry. The industry objects to the use of the
sign to indicate immediate as well as long-term hazards. The
harmonized system is meant to improve worker safety
standards and consumer protection around the world in the
labeling and transport of chemical goods. . . . Page A-5

GAO SEEKS CRITERIA FOR MEASURING SUCCESS OF EFFORTS TO
PROTECT WETLANDS

Criteria should be established for measuring the ecological
success of wetlands mitigation efforts to ensure in-lieu fee
arrangements and other means of mitigating wetland losses
accomplish their goals, the General Accounting Office says.
In-lieu fee mitigation occurs when a permittee pays a fee
instead of performing mitigation associated with a project
or buying credits from a mitigation bank--parcels of land
set aside and restored, usually as high-quality wetlands.
"The extent to which the in-lieu-fee option has achieved its
purpose of mitigating adverse impacts to wetlands is
uncertain," GAO said. . . . Page A-2

HOUSE BILL WOULD REQUIRE STUDY ON REDUCING NUMBER OF
GASOLINE BLENDS

Two Wisconsin congressmen offer legislation (H.R. 2017) to
require an EPA study on the feasibility of reducing the
number of gasoline blends sold in the Midwest and other
parts of the country. The representatives say they want the
EPA to determine whether more uniformity among gasoline
blends would ease supply problems and bring down prices. . .

NORTH CAROLINA EXPECTED TO FALL SHORT OF SOLID WASTE
REDUCTION GOAL

The amount of solid waste disposed of in North Carolina has
dramatically increased over the past 10 years, making the
state's waste disposal reduction goals impossible to meet,
according to the state Department of Environment and Natural
Resources. The department's latest solid waste management
annual report says the amount of solid waste disposed of by
North Carolina residents has increased by 45 percent since
1991. . . . Page A-6

ICELAND EXPECTS TO RECEIVE EXEMPTION UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE
TREATY

An exemption to allow Iceland to build a new industrial
facility without violating the Kyoto Protocol's limits on
greenhouse gases probably will be approved by the climate
change pact's signatories, perhaps as early as July.
Iceland's environment minister, Siv Fridleifsdo`ttir, says
the exemption would acknowledge that one additional factory
in Iceland could lead to a large percentage increase in the
nation's greenhouse gas emissions. The clause is scheduled
to be discussed at the climate change talks in Bonn in July.

U.S.-CANADA: A science advisory panel is expected to meet in
June to review nontarget plant toxicity tests being
harmonized under NAFTA by EPA and Canada's Pest Management
Regulatory Agency. The review by the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act Scientific Advisory Panel is
a step toward harmonizing U.S. and Canadian data
requirements on the toxicity of pesticides to plants not
targeted by the chemicals.

An EPA official says the review could assist the two
agencies in conducting plant risk assessments and in
reducing uncertainty in risk management decisions.

Under NAFTA, Canada and the United States agree to develop
compatible pesticide review programs to facilitate routine
sharing of work. . . . Page A-6

REGISTRATION: A recent arbitration decision on how one
pesticide maker should compensate another for data generated
to support regulatory decisions may lead to the use of a
hybrid method of data citation, an attorney involved in the
dispute tells BNA. Pesticide makers may try to combine the
methods of data citation known as selective citation and
cite-all citation, according to the attorney who represented
Gharda U.S.A. in the arbitration involving the pesticide
chlorpyrifos. . . . Page A-5

Dear Mr. Derrick:

     Les LoBaugh suggested that I contact you to inquire about an in-house
counsel position at Enron. I am the General Counsel of Niagara Mohawk Holding's
unregulated subsidiaries, Niagara Mohawk Energy, Inc. and Niagara Mohawk Energy
Marketing, Inc. We expect the sale of Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing to close
in November or December of this year, pending FERC approval, and a sale of
Niagara Mohawk Energy's Distributed Power and Energy Services Business units may
occur contemporaneously with that closing. Therefore, I am now pursuing other
career opportunities.

     I am a good candidate for an in-house counsel position at Enron because of
my 12 years experience as an attorney in the energy industry. As General Counsel
for the Company, I provide legal services and business advise to senior
management and the Board of Directors of both the energy marketing and the
energy services subsidiaries. My experience includes drafting and negotiating
gas and electric retail sales agreements and master agreements and related
documents for wholesale energy trading and marketing transactions, including
physical transactions and financial instruments such as swaps. I monitor and I
am responsible for representing my company in FERC and state regulatory
proceedings. I keep up to date on the fast moving events and trends in the
energy marketing and trading industry by closely monitoring regulatory
proceedings, reading information that is published in trade and related energy
industry publications and my involvement with the National Energy Marketers
Association and the Federal Energy Bar Association. I am also responsible for
representing the company and managing outside counsel in litigation and
alternative dispute resolution proceedings. My experience includes utility
regulatory and legal matters, the transactional work associated with corporate
mergers and acquisitions, corporate governance, human resource/employee issues,
interconnection agreements, municipal law, leasing, financing and secured
transaction agreements, commercial contracts, condemnation litigation and real
property matters.

     I have attached my resume for your review. Please contact me at your
earliest convenience to schedule an interview. I look forward to hearing from
you soon.

     Thank you for your consideration.

                         Very truly yours,
                         Steven R. Pincus

I believe that Scott Josey is the commercial guy responsible for Crescendo.  I have left him a voice mail about this and will let everyone know his response.

Janet just left me a voice mail and believes this is an ENA deal after all.  Barbara--you may want to get ahold of Janet to verify ownership on this one.  Please let this group know what the final answer is.  DF

The Crescendo project is a Northern Border project, and the appropriate contact for Christopher Sullivan (the fellow that left Jim the voice mail) is probably Janet Place.  I've left Janet a voice mail with the contact information on Sullivan and asked her to get ahold of him regarding his letter on the helium issue.  In case you access email ahead of voice mail Janet, the guy is Chistopher Sullivan, Rocky Mountain Helium, 1-800-945-1547.  Thanks all.  DF

Hi Jim,

Well, it's been quite a month!  I hope the dust is clearing for you a
little bit, at least.

The results of our email poll of Executive Committee members for our
inaugural meeting are as follows:

a)  Friday, January 11, 2002 -- all can make it except McNamara, Kryder
and (maybe) Green;

b)  Friday, January 18, 2002 -- all can make it except Kryder and
(maybe) Green;

c)  Wednesday, January 23, 2002 -- all can make it except (maybe) Green.

Shall we go ahead and nail down the meeting date and circulate it so the
folks can lock it in on their calendars?  What day do you choose?

Thank you so much for finding the time to manage this matter, as you
have, amid all the other matters on your plate.

David

Subject: Summer Intern Program




I am a member of the  Houston Bar Association -- Minority Opportunities in the Legal Profession  Committee.  One of the programs we sponsor is a first-year law student  internship program.   This committee meets with the students at all of  the law schools in Houston and asks them to submit their resumes.  We then  provide copies of the resumes to prospective employers for review.  The  employer then selects the students they would like to interview.   

 

Some employers have  the students participate in their permanent hiring programs.  Others  provide this simply as a learning experience for the students.  The  employer determines the length of the internship and the compensation.  Six  weeks is a common period.  This is a great program which has provided  valuable experience to a large number of students for many years.  If your  organization would be interested in participating in this program, or if you  would like more information, please e-mail me or call me.  I appreciate  your consideration of this matter.   (Please feel free to forward this  e-mail to the appropriate person(s) in your organization.)

To the Executive Committee:

Ted has advised that Exxon Mobil prefers that the sponsors for the
Rogers Award ceremony (reception and dinner) not be drawn solely from
firms which represent Exxon Mobil.  I intend to contact as many as three
firms which do a substantial amount of work for Exxon Mobil --
Fulbright, Akin Gump and Baker Botts -- but I need to identify one or
two other sponsors for the event, which will be held at the Petroleum
Club of Houston, February 21, 2002.  The total financial sponsorship we
seek is $15,000, which should almost cover the direct out of pocket
costs of the event.  So, the amount of contributions needed (which
should be equally shared among the co-sponsors) will be $7,500 each if
we go with only two sponsors, or $5,000 if we go with three co-sponsors,
or $3,750 if we go with four co-sponsors.

Please advise me ASAP (this week) whether your firm or organization is
interested in co-sponsoring the event this year, in any of the above
amounts.  The reason I'd like to hear from you this week is that I'd
like to include recognition of the sponsors in the Institute brochure if
possible, and it is about ready to go to the printer.  To help you
discuss the possibility of sponsorship with your partners, further info
about the Rogers Award and the benefits of sponsorship follows below.

In the last two years, the ceremony has been a gala affair in the
evening on the first night of the Institute, including a reception and
dinner, instead of the Institute luncheon event of prior years.  As in
prior years, attendance at the ceremony was included in the tuition for
the Institute, so all Institute attendees were invited to attend without
further cost and most of them did.  Since membership on our Advisory
Board includes tuition-free attendance at the Institute, all Advisory
Board members are also invited to attend the ceremony without charge and
many of them did.  Attendees have been invited to bring spouses or other
guests, but there has been a $100 charge for guests.

In 2000, we honored Sir John Browne at the Hall of State in Dallas; the
reception was sponsored by Jones Day, which contributed $7,500 for the
reception.  In 2001, we honored Ken Lay at the Institute of Texan
Cultures in San Antonio;  the reception was sponsored by Vinson &
Elkins, which contributed $7,500 for the reception.

The actual out of pocket expense for the entire 2001 event was over
$16,000.

This year, as you know, we are endeavoring to make the Oil and Gas
Institute (including the Rogers Award ceremony), like all CAIL programs,
self-sufficient financially.  Attendance at the award ceremony will
again be included in the Institute tuition and all Advisory Board
members will again be invited to attend cost-free as well.  Because we
are honoring Lee Raymond, we want to continue the recent tradition of
presenting the award at a gala evening event.  Accordingly, we'd like to
obtain sponsorships for the Rogers Award ceremony (reception and dinner)
this year of $15,000.

For their financial contribution, sponsoring firms will get: (a)
sponsorship recognition/publicity at the Rogers Award event in the form
of a welcome sign, in the written event program and orally from the
podium, (b) sponsorship recognition in literature at the Institute, and
probably oral announcements from the Institute podium, (c) recognition
in our annual list of contributors to the Institute for Energy Law (how
does that new name sound to you?) in our CAIL annual report, and (d) the
right to invite several guests to the event, in addition to the firm's
attorneys who may already be attending the Institute.  I'd like to also
include (e) recognition/publicity in the Institute brochure, which will
be mailed to about 40,000 attorneys nation-wide.  To get this additional
recognition in the brochure, however, as I said, we need to confirm the
sponsor(s) this week, hence my request to hear from you, if you are
interested, ASAP (ideally today or tomorrow so I'll have time to line up
the other co-sponsors before the publication deadline).

As our Membership Committee advised at the October meeting, many firms
welcome sponsorship opportunities such as this as good marketing for the
firm.  In this case, it is also an opportunity to help celebrate Lee
Raymond's outstanding career in the oil and gas industry, to help
continue the Annual Institute's tradition of excellence in oil and gas
law education, and to help the Institute for Energy Law grow into its
new name.

Though not mandatory, I would hope that the sponsor(s) will either be or
become members of the Institute for Energy Law.

In short, please let me know ASAP if your firm or organization is
willing to co-sponsor the Rogers Award ceremony this year.

On two related matters, I'm happy to report that Strasburger & Price has
offered to sponsor the Deans of Oil and Gas Practice Lecture Luncheon on
Friday this year in the amount of $4,000 (thanks, Stuart) and Jones Day
Reavis & Pogue has offered to sponsor as an experiment for the Institute
a networking lunch (no speaker) on Thursday in the amount of $4,000
(thanks, Brad).  I'm also happy to report that the Institute program and
faculty this year are excellent, and that the program will again include
several new features developed by the Institute co-chairs (thanks, Brad
and Jack).

Sorry for making this request at the last minute, but I'd like to see
the sponsors recognized in the Institute brochure, as well as in the
other ways mentioned, and I also want to get the brochure to the printer
this week.  I certainly understand if this is too short notice to get
the necessary approvals so quickly.  If we can't get the necessary
sponsors identified this week, we'll go ahead and print the brochure
without this recognition and the sponsors will receive our recognition
and thanks in the other ways mentioned.

Thanks much.

David

PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERS FOR AIRPORT  SECURITY
There is overwhelming evidence that highly  professional public-
private partnerships work in high-threat European  countries, says 
Kenneth P. Quinn, former chief counsel to the Federal  Aviation 
Administration.
The European system compares favorably to the  unfunded mandate to 
provide security at airports that is put on American  airlines, 
says Quinn:
o There, the screening workforce is about 15 percent  public 
and 85 percent private, and wages are often 60  percent 
higher -- here, wages are too low.
o There, turnover is around 15 percent; here, it  often 
exceeds 100 percent.
o There, national governments impose strict training,  with 
36 hours' classroom time and up to 200 hours' airport  
training -- here, we require 12 hours' classroom and  only 
40 hours' on-the-job training.
There, proof of European Union member-state  citizenship is often 
required of workers. Here, resident-alien status  suffices. 
There, federal governments license the companies and  their 
workers. Here, all security responsibilities fall on  carriers, 
with no federal certification.
Disparaging and certainly nationalizing the private  workforce at 
U.S. airports -- which by all accounts performed  properly on 
Sept. 11 -- will cause the current system of contract  workers to 
break down, as workers look for new jobs or transfer  to more 
secure ones.
President Bush has asked Congress not to tie his  hands by 
preventing him from turning to the private sector,  saying: 
"Giving the government flexibility to use private  contractors 
will facilitate transition to the new system, promote  better 
screening services through competition, and ensure  that security 
managers can move swiftly to discipline or remove  employees who 
fail to live up to the rigorous new  standards."

Janet just left me a voice mail and believes this is an ENA deal after all.  Barbara--you may want to get ahold of Janet to verify ownership on this one.  Please let this group know what the final answer is.  DF

The Crescendo project is a Northern Border project, and the appropriate contact for Christopher Sullivan (the fellow that left Jim the voice mail) is probably Janet Place.  I've left Janet a voice mail with the contact information on Sullivan and asked her to get ahold of him regarding his letter on the helium issue.  In case you access email ahead of voice mail Janet, the guy is Chistopher Sullivan, Rocky Mountain Helium, 1-800-945-1547.  Thanks all.  DF

Care has to be taken as to what constitutes an "acceptable" waiver letter, and if it is too broad (e.g., gives them anything in the way of being able to take sides against us on a matter on which they have done work for us) it would be unacceptable.

Subject:	In re F&J Representation
Importance:	High



	I have now spoken with the following people in doing further due diligence:

	1.  Theresa Bushman.  Theresa tells me that she shares the view with Mariner's GC that it would be helpful to have F&J continue to represent Mariner for the time being, given F&J's knowledge of Mariner's corporate history.  Theresa, if I have mischaracterized what you told me, please respond.

	2.   Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner's GC.  Kelly advised me recently that she has a new corporate matter of some urgency that she wants to retain F&J to handle, subject to your approval.  Kelly told me that she would be contacting you about this.

	3.   Prof. John Dzienkowski of the University School of Law.   John has given me his informal thoughts over the telephone on the ethical issues, based on hypotheticals I presented to him; of course, these are not to be taken as recommendations.  In a nutshell, John thinks it would be problematic for a law firm to unilaterally withdraw from the representation of a corporate client solely and only to be able to take on more business potentially adverse to that client in the future.  John thinks it might be appropriate to ask for a disgorgement of fees paid under these circumstances.

	4.  Uriel Dutton.  Dutton says that with an appropriate waiver letter, F&J would be willing to continue its representation of Enron and the Enron subsidiaries, including Mariner and the proposed new Mariner matter, conditioned on the following:

	a.  F&J could not continue to represent Corp. on  one of the three IP matters, which is the nonprovisional patent application (although Dutton was not specific, I believe F&J lists it as the "Method and System for the Determination of VAR").

	b.  F&J would continue to represent Corp. on the six or so abestosis matters in order to try and get Corp. dismissed, but with the understanding that if dismissal was not available, that new representation would be obtained by Corp. before trial.

	c.  Dutton will be sending over a draft proposed waiver letter for our consideration.   We told Dutton that we anticipated getting back to him on this matter early next week.  Although Dutton will be out of the office next week, he will be reachable by cell phone.

	Proposed going forward strategy:

	Chuck and I suggest that if an acceptable waiver letter can be fashioned, that we proceed with proposal offered by F&J.  We invite comments.

	Britt

Thanks for the input, Rob.  Julia has already gone through the Enron Europe and Enron Wind interview processes.  She speaks excellent English, as well as German.  In addition to myself and Chris Wood, she was interviewed by an Enron Wind German lawyer (who has left and she is replacing), an Enron Corp. German lawyer, and by a German lawyer from Punder.  The feedback is unanimously positive.  I think I have run all of the interview traps in Europe, and am confident that she will be a real asset to our department and to the Enron Wind Europe team.

Photo Sessions for Next Pictorial Roster Set for June 19-20, August 14-15

	The Houston Bar Association has contracted with a new publisher for
the 2002 edition of the HBA Pictorial Roster, and photography sessions have
been scheduled for members who would like to have a new picture taken for
the Roster -- free of charge.
	Any member who would like to have his or her photo taken may come by
the Houston Bar Association office between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:00
p.m. on June 19 or June 20. Another session will be scheduled August 14 and
August 15. There is no charge for the photo, no appointment is necessary,
and the photo sessions will take only a few minutes. The Houston Bar
Association office is located downtown at 1001 Fannin, Suite 1300.
	Members may also submit their own photo for the Roster, or use an
existing photo already on file with the HBA.
	Legal Directories Publishing Company, Inc. will begin publishing
annual editions of the Pictorial Roster, rather than every two years. The
HBA hopes to have as many current photos as possible in the new Roster, so
please take advantage of this opportunity.

Subject:	India -- Recent E-Mails re Inappropriate Activities

Rob -

I met with John Brindle on Friday to discuss the recent India e-mails.  Earlier, I talked with Bob Sparger, the HR person who is mentioned in one of the e-mails.  

I've also now reviewed a series of e-mails from "Anonymous", "Enron Wellwisher" and "Amit Patil".  I can't find any allegations in these e-mails that Enron has misbehaved vis-a-vis the outside world -- all of the allegations seem to me to relate to breaches of internal policies, self-dealing, etc.  Accordingly, I don't see an FCPA hook in these e-mails.  I asked John and Bob and they confirm that they do not see an FCPA issue in these e-mails.

Let me know what role you think Legal should play.  I'd be happy to have HR take the lead in following-up on what are largely HR issues.  If you want us to be more assertive in this process, we can do that as well.  In an earlier e-mail, I thought that we might be able to get Paul or Robert to help out with these e-mails.  I just don't see that this is feasible at this point -- these guys are working non-stop at firefighting at present.  We could, however, get Lena or one of the other lawyers involved.

By the way, John's people will investigate how Anonymous is getting access to our e-mail system.

Bruce

Dear All,

With reference to Art 14.2 (11) of the Articles of Association the Management Board wishes to ask the Supervisory Board for written consent to assign the rights of ownership of motor vehicle Alfa Romeo (reg - RLE 400) to the insurers PZU to enable them to pay compensation to ENS for the theft of the vehicle. Should the vehicle now be found, the property rights to the vehicle will reside with PZU.

Rob, I have thought about this lately also.  We just can't lose all that history.  Let me check with Ken and we'll try to do it this month, but I don't want you to have a visitor  badge.

Rosie:

I have about 70 interviews on the Ken Lay and Enron story transcribed and in various states of revision, and of course the future of the project is now up in the air.

What I have on paper naturally tells a positive story about Ken individually and Enron.   I am concerned that all this will be lost given what has gone on in recent weeks and months and what will continue to go on in 2002 with legal matters.  One pitch I have is that I could finish the interviews and revisions focusing on the many positives before the merger to ensure that this record exists for posterity.

Could you prioritize a meeting with Ken to discuss what I have and where we could go with it in the future either internally or externally?  A lot of ideas are running through my head.  Cindy Olson is also involved with this, and I need to talk to Jim Derrick some  for the legal angle.  One or both of them could join us at the meeting if Ken would like--along with anyone else Ken would like to be there.

If this meeting is in December that will be fine, but I might have a visitor badge by then for all I know.

- Rob

P.S. I'm fine--hope you are too!

Jim, I continue to see that Enron is dominating a large section of the
energy industry news these days.  I hope everything is going well for you
and that when everything shakes out you will, as always, come out shining.

Best wishes, Les

Gentlemen -

A few brief updates:

The hearing before the Bombay High Court regarding MERC jurisdiction is still on for Monday.  We are still not sure whether or not there will be anything substantive discussed at the hearing.  Gail Brownfeld and Christopher Walker are flying to Bombay just in case.  I just spoke with Jim McCartney and he is planning to try to attend as well.  

There was no unified "message" from the lenders at the conclusion of the Singapore lenders meetings.  Our Finance guys are pretty confident that the offshore lenders will not cure the construction contract defaults this month.  The Indian banks may or may not cure.  If no one cures, the construction contracts will terminate in mid-June. 

We received a copy of a very interesting letter from the Chairman of MSEB to the India Central Electricity Authority and copied to GOM dated January 11, 2001 (less than three weeks before we were first accused of misdeclaring).  The Chairman states:  

"The high price of Dabhol power today was perhaps not accurately anticipated. . . .DPC Phase II trial runs are to commence shortly. . . .It is a fact that we have not been able to fully absorb even DPC phase I power at 90% PLF. . . .[O]nly on MSEB projections and certification DPC have invested a huge sum in Phase II.  Can we ask them to stop now?  Poor off-takes of DPC power are not just because of low demand, but also on account of the high price and the poor financial condition of MSEB.  We would be grateful for Government advice in the matter."

It appears to me that the "advice" was to charge that DPC was misdeclaring its availability and to demand huge offsets as a result.

Bruce

To members of the Board: the request for additional  funding to complete the post-flood renovation of Jones Hall did not make it onto  today's City Council agenda. Instead, it will be considered next Wednesday  morning. I plan to attend the meeting as a very inobtrusive observer, and will  let you know what happens.
 
Have a wonderful Thanksgiving with your families.  I'll be in touch next week!

Subject: Jones Hall renovation  update
To my board members:
 
A great deal has transpired over the past several  weeks, as Ann and Toby can attest, and I thought that a brief update to you  was in order. 
 
HOK, CHP and Gilbane have been working hard on  the areas of the Hall yet to be renovated/restored, to wit:
 
1. Music library (to be relocated above ground  into the jump area, encompassing the old usher's room, etc.)
2. Dressing rooms
3. Storage for instruments and other  items
4. Symphony offices
5. SPA offices
6. Rehearsal hall
 
I wrote to you two weeks ago asking your thoughts  about using Jones Hall funds to assist with the renovation of the rehearsal  hall, primarily to protect Mario et al from going back to City Council for  more money. However, the accumulated projects listed above have turned out to  be so costly that there was no way to eke out the dollars here and there. As a  result, Mario and Jordy Tollett are now leading a new request to fund the  projects listed above. This request COULD (but will not necessarily) be  presented to Council next Tuesday, November 23 by Jordy. 
 
The total cost of these projects is $2.9 million,  of which approximately $1 million is attributable to the relocation of the  music library and the "dominoes" that follow that relocation - i.e., the  relocation of the storage rooms and the dressing rooms.
 
I will let you know what happens at City Council.  Mario has been good about keeping me informed but has not asked for any help  from the Foundation.
 
In other areas, Chip has settled back into the  Hall and we are acquiring office furniture for his humble space. I will be  contacting each of you to schedule a meeting in early December, and at that  time will issue a 2002 quarterly board meeting calendar that we will try to  cast in stone for next year.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions. I  am relieved that it appears that the Foundation will not need to part with  more money to help with this renovation at the present time, although we might  still be called upon to do so. I will keep you informed.
 
Have a wonderful weekend and, if I don't speak  with you next week, a lovely Thanksgiving.
 
Best,
 
Kim Sterling

Hardie Davis and I plan to join Sunday's Audit Comm. and BoD meeting by phone.  Will you be here physically or via phone?  I am just looking for a human being from the Company who might be here in case other humans decide to come to the building as well!   We have reserved 50M03 for people attending in person.

Laura Valencia and Mary Martinez will be here for any administrative needs, and Laura will start the call and be on the communications line.  I will have a second line and be able to communicate directly with her if necessary.

I do not yet know if Ken plans to be in the building or not.  Please drop me a note with your plans.  

Rick - Do you have a preference for the AA guys?  Also, have you considered an executive session at the start or at the end of the call for any matters the Audit Comm. might want to address in that forum?  We could keep the third-party folks on "music hold" if you choose to have an exec. session.

Jim - I am trying to be out of the office next Mon. - Wed..  Hardie will be here and I will be very accessible.  Let me know if you have any concerns about that, but I think I can manage the activities from afar for a few days.  

Thank you.

Jim,

B&M are our lead firm in Japan, and are used extensively by Jane McBride, and also on a more sporadic basis by businesses in London (eg metals and the Wind business) which have operations in Japan. Enron Wind in Japan have appointed Paul Davies of B&M in Tokyo to act on a joint venture for Enron Wind in Japan.

In the summer of 2000, we undertook some basic physical gas due diligence re gas in the Ukraine utilising Baker & McKenzie's Kiev office.  This was in preparation for a potential long-term gas deal to get gas out of the Ukraine to the Romanian border (for onward sale in Romania / Poland).  B&M was the only "recognised" firm in the Ukraine.

That's it.


							Mark

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

=20

=20

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=
ies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will b=
e incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als=
o be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations=
, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) =

ilding, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (=
713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be consi=
dered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders i=
n connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their d=
irect or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are availab=

Mark, I'm sure you are aware of the comments in the press that I have copied and inserted here below.  There have been others that are similar.  Basically, the press is reporting that we have dissolved the LJM partnerships, ended all relationships with the LJM entities, etc.  All that we have done is unwind the raptor entities, LJM still exists, all other transactions with LJM still exist, it's just that Andy sold his interest in the partnerships.  Michael Kopper owns them and would probably be considered a "friend of Enron" by investors/journalists.

I'm concerned about our efforts to build back investor confidence - do we correct the press?  how do we address this?  I'm concerned that we will once again be hit with credibility concerns when the press or investors fully understand that LJM still exists and we have deals still pending with it and have deals still in place with it.  How do we correct this erroneous press?   Sherron Watkins

Excerpts:

The Crescendo project is a Northern Border project, and the appropriate contact for Christopher Sullivan (the fellow that left Jim the voice mail) is probably Janet Place.  I've left Janet a voice mail with the contact information on Sullivan and asked her to get ahold of him regarding his letter on the helium issue.  In case you access email ahead of voice mail Janet, the guy is Chistopher Sullivan, Rocky Mountain Helium, 1-800-945-1547.  Thanks all.  DF

Michelle and Kriste: 
You probably know about this case already, but this was filed this week in Federal Court: 
Pamela Tittle et al. v. Enron Corp. et al. 
11/13/2001-3913 
The description of the facts are: 
Possible class action ERISA violation case in which the defendants failed to fulfill their fiduciary duties to an Enron employee retirement plan by misrepresenting the financial status of hedging agreements made with third party partnerships.
The plaintiff's attorney is Robin Harrison.  I know Robin quite well.  He does not do that much employment work, and is more of a commercial litigator.  As you know, I have done a substantial amount of ERISA work and would be interested in helping Enron out on this case.  Please let me know what we can do to help.

Dear All,

With reference to Art 14.2 (11) of the Articles of Association the Management Board wishes to ask the Supervisory Board for written consent to assign the rights of ownership of motor vehicle Alfa Romeo (reg - RLE 400) to the insurers PZU to enable them to pay compensation to ENS for the theft of the vehicle. Should the vehicle now be found, the property rights to the vehicle will reside with PZU.

Jim,

B&M are our lead firm in Japan, and are used extensively by Jane McBride, and also on a more sporadic basis by businesses in London (eg metals and the Wind business) which have operations in Japan. Enron Wind in Japan have appointed Paul Davies of B&M in Tokyo to act on a joint venture for Enron Wind in Japan.

In the summer of 2000, we undertook some basic physical gas due diligence re gas in the Ukraine utilising Baker & McKenzie's Kiev office.  This was in preparation for a potential long-term gas deal to get gas out of the Ukraine to the Romanian border (for onward sale in Romania / Poland).  B&M was the only "recognised" firm in the Ukraine.

That's it.

It looks like an Oregonian investigative reporter is trying to  put a story together suggesting that our management advised  employees that they should be investing in Enron stock through  their 401Ks (see attached note from our public affairs).   
 
Jim (or Rob), should we be conferring with Enron defense  counsel on this, and if so who?  dn

Jeff Manning at The Oregonian called to say tomorrow's newspaper will have  another report on the Enron 401(k) problems, and the connection to PGE through  the details of three lawsuits. I said nothing new, but did clarify a quote that  had appeared from PGE in the previous story Manning wrote.
 
I've copied Doug on this because the issue is getting more serious.  Manning informed me that The Oregonian has now assigned him and Gail Hill  to "charge ahead and do more on this story." They want to sit down with HR and  review documentation that proves that we have provided financial planning  counsel, that we have provided information about diversifying portfolios, etc.  This is strongly leaning in the legal area, and we would like to have  counsel before saying anything further. We can't expect much cover from Enron,  either: Manning vented to me about how no one there will return his calls.
 
Carol, Gail, Kregg and I can be available to meet early tomorrow to discuss  how to move ahead on this. Doug, let us know if sometime before noon might work  for you. Thanks.

Subject:	Home Depot Waiver


Vicki-I apologize again for a K&S partner having attended the initial
meeting between Enron and Home Depot yesterday before you and Jim Derrick
had an opportunity to review our waiver request.  As I mentioned to you
yesterday, none of the lawyers who worked on the Electrolux matter (myself,
Ken Culotta and Kevin Keenan) will have any involvement in the Home Depot
matter.  I can also confirm that the amount of work Erik Swenson (who would
lead the project on behalf of Home Depot) has done for Enron to date has
been minimal and none of it has involved EES's energy outsourcing business.

As I believe both clients are anxious to work on the potential transaction,
please let me know of the waiver as soon as you can.

Regards

John

SUBJECT; RE:INTRODUCTION OF (OAHED)AND REQUEST FOR
FINANCIAL/TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR EFFECTIVE TAKE-OFF
OF ESTABLISHING A LIAISON OFFICE  IN THE GAMBIA.

ATTN:JAMES

INTRODUCTION
*Organization of African Health and Economic
Development (OAHED), was created with a vision to
coordinates efforts to combat diseases and promote
physical and mental health. Contribute significantly
to eradicate communicable diseases and promoting
improved sanitation and health condition in Africa and
promote economic development.
*OAHED based on a common vision on economic
stabilization strategies and shared conviction , that
(OAHED) have  a pressing duty  to eradicate poverty
and diseases and to place Africa countries both
individually and collectively on the path of
sustainable growth development at the same time
participate actively in the world economy.
*The programmme of (OAHED) is anchored on the
determination  of Africans to extricate themselves and
the continent from the malaise of underdevelopment and
exclusion in the world globalization.
*Poverty and backwardness of African stand in stark
contrast to the prosperity of the developed world.The
continued imagination of Africa from the globalisaton
process and the social exclusion of the vast majority
of its people constitute a serious threat to global
stability.
*In Africa, 365 million peoples or half of the
population live on less than $1.00 per day.The
mortality rate of children under 5years of age is 140
per 1000 and life expectancy at birth is only 54
years. Only 41 percent of the population have access
to safe water, medical care, education etc. The high
rate of illiteracy for people over 15 is 54 percent.
*OAHED calls for the reversal of this abnormal
situation by changing the relationship that underpins
it.African are appealing neither for the further
entrenchment of dependency through aid, nor for
margical concession.
*We are convinced that an historical opportunity
present itself to end the scourge of underdevelopment
that afflicts Africa. The resources, including
capital, technology and human skills that are required
to launch a global war on poverty and underdevelopment
exist in abundance.What is required to mobilize these
resource and use them properly, is bold and
imaginative leadership that is genuinely committed to
a sustained effort of human upliftment and poverty
eradication as well as a new global partnership based
on shared responsibility and mutual interest.
*In the circumstance, Organization of African Health
and Economic Development(OAHED) hereby declare that we
will no longer allow ourselves/African countries to be
conditioned by circumstances. We determine our own
destiny and call on the rest of the world to help and
complement our efforts. There are already signs of
progress and hopes. Democratic regimes that are
committed to the protection of human rights, peoples
centered development and market oriented economies are
on the increase. African people have begun to
demonstrate their refusal to accept poor economic and
political leadership.These development are,  however
uneven and inadequate and head to be further
expedited.
OAHED is about consolidating and accelerating these
gains. It is a call  for a new relationship of
partnership  between African and the international
community, especially the highly industrialised
countries, to overcome the development chasm that has
of course widened over centuries of unequal relations.
*Our perfect knowledge in respect of the high level of
your commitment and goodness in the vineyard of
humanity impressed and impelled us to seek for your
kind assistance to establish the (OAHED) liaison
office in the Gambia.
The materials and funds needed for the effective
take-off are as follow:
1.Cost of renting /furnishing
office??????????.USD$38,000.00
2.Logistics, ie, vehicles???????????????USD$325,000.00
3.Staff emolument, mobility and communication
etc????USD$57,000.00
4.Contingency  (5%)
    Grand Total ???????????????????USD$420,000.00
In the light of this, we are now on board in a
situation not to be described caused by financial
difficulty. We have no facilities neither have we any
money to purchase those materials that are absolutely
necessary in this issue.Your goodness to humanity has
ever been such as leaves not the smallest doubt you
will not suffer us to starve in the situation  you
have been pleased to place us, and which is such as
will ever tend to make us the most grateful/happy and
to ensure success as well as accomplish the set-up
goals.You  will be induced to take this issue into
consideration an urgent intervention in this
impediment, and by a little pecuniary aid, please
save us from this impasse.It will be an act worthy of
your self, and that imprint upon our heart which will
never be erased.
*OAHED will welcome any assistance you render to
enable us put in place the relevant infrastructures
that would enhance the effective and the presence of
Organization of African Health and Economic
Development in the Gambia. Any assistance given should
be considered a worthwhile service to God and Humanity
.If you require any further information or
clarification in any point, please do not hesitate to
ask.

Looking Forward to The Pleasure of your Compliance.

Yours Faithfully

Rev. Emmanuel .  E. Awuruh
CEO/PRESIDENT
ORGANIZATION OF AFRICAN HEALTH AND ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT(OAHED)
THE GAMBIA, WEST AFRICA.

Jim-I'm sorry to be bothering you about this again, but I need to get your
clearance for me to represent BP in a transaction in Bolivia where BP,
through its partially owned subsidiary Empresa Petrolera Chaco, will be
selling gas to Southern Cone Gas Ltd.  As I understand it, the gas is
intended for Enron's Cuiab? power plant in Brazil.

Thanks again.

John

Paul -

All of the news today should be considered victories for the Dabhol Legal Team:  

 -- DPC's amendment to writ petition to address the biasness of MERC's commissioners was allowed.  

 -- Commissioner Deo recused himself from any further MERC hearings.  

 -- The final merits hearing on MERC jurisdiction was set for Dec. 11-14.  

Please pass along my appreciation to everyone at DPC involved in the effort.

NEWPOWER IN THE NEWS  -  =20
NEWPOWER TESTS CONSERVATION TOOLS - [Philadelphia Business Journal, May 31.=
] The next time you forget whether you left the thermostat on, there's a ch=
ance you could turn it off with your cell phone.   You could, that is, if y=
ou're from one of 300 households in Philadelphia that will participate in o=
ne of three pilot programs that will link electricity meters to the Interne=
t. http://philadelphia.bcentral.com/philadelphia/stories/2001/05/28/daily27=
.html=20

NEWPOWER SEES SAVINGS FROM SMART ENERGY TECHNOLOGY - [Reuters, June 1.] New=
Power said it will conduct three pilot programs in Philadelphia to test con=
sumers' reaction to "smart" energy saving technology.  These new products r=
equire "smart"' meters that tell  a "smart"' device to operate when the cos=
t of generating electricity is cheapest?" Energy restructuring leads to tec=
hnological innovation, efficiency and environmental benefits,"' said H. Eug=
ene Lockhart, NewPower's president and chief executive officer.  "`These pi=
lots are a wonderful example of control being shifted from the utility to t=
he consumer. The nation's move to energy restructuring makes it possible fo=
r consumers to better manage their energy needs." http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/0=
10601/n0179210.html

ENERGY-SAVING TECHNOLOGY TO BE USED IN PILOT PROGRAM - [Philadelphia Inquir=
er, June 1.] NewPower said it would launch three residential pilot programs=
 in Philadelphia this month, to gauge consumer response to energy-saving te=
chnology.  The three programs will include 100 homes each and consist of a =
time-of-use metering pilot, a heating and air-conditioning control pilot, a=
nd a Web-based interactive pilot, which lets customers control their thermo=
stat from any Web-enabled device. NewPower said it wanted to learn how cons=
umers react to pricing and features of so-called demand-side management mea=
sures, and how to make them profitable. =09
NEWPOWER TO LEARN IMPACT OF HI-TECH METERS, CONTROLS ON CUSTOMERS LIVES - [=
Restructuring Today, June 1.] NewPower is taking the latest in DSM technolo=
gy to the people in an effort to see how they react?.Tim Vail, NewPower's v=
ice president of energy technology solutions, is not doing a technology bet=
a test.   "We want to learn consumer acceptance and responses to the produc=
ts."  A critical Vail target is learning how residential consumer lifestyle=
s compare with load profiles so test volunteers will have to fill out a num=
ber of questionnaires about what they were doing at a given time.  The powe=
r industry has long bunched up ratepayers into classes using an average to =
picture typical use of customers.  "We've got empirical data from a variety=
 of sources but we want to get real world experience with it," Vail noted, =
a major departure from most metering pilots underway these days?"How do we =
take this technology and meld it into a product that consumers will want an=
d use - that's the critical component of restructuring," he added?"Educatio=
n is a major component of the whole piece for us," Vail said. =09

SAVING ENERGY IS HOT AGAIN - [Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, June 3.] Not since t=
he oil crisis of the 1970s has the public's interest in energy conservation=
 seemed so high.  Even President Bush touts the value of conservation, desp=
ite criticism from environmentalists that his administration's policies rel=
y too much on increased energy production and too little on energy efficien=
cy and conservation. John Hangar, a former PUC member and current president=
 of PennFuture, an environmental and consumer advocacy organization, wants =
electric utilities to install time-of-use meters in customers' homes. . . A=
t least one company has leap-frogged over state regulators. NewPower began =
installing energy-saving technology in 300 households in the greater Philad=
elphia area.  "These pilots are a wonderful example of control being shifte=
d from the utility to the customer. The nation's move to energy restructuri=
ng makes it possible for consumers to better manage their energy costs," sa=

TWO MARKETERS CUT NATURAL GAS PRICES - [Atlanta Journal-Constitution, June =
1.] Atlantans are getting a small break on their energy bills: Two leading =
Georgia natural gas marketers have reduced prices following a sharp drop in=

ranteed for one year, by 5 percent and its variable price by 3 percent?NewP=
ower, a new entrant in Georgia's unregulated natural gas market, is offerin=
g to lock in a gas price of 74.9 cents per therm for two years. That compar=
es with one-year offers of 84.9 cents per therm from Georgia Natural Gas an=
d 76.9 cents from Shell Energy.=20

NEWPOWER TO START GAS SALES TO PG&E CUSTOMERS IN CALIFORNIA - [Bloomberg, J=
une 4.] NewPower is offering northern California residents two-year fixed-p=

pokeswoman Gael Doar said. http://www.bloomberg.com/fgcgi.cgi?T=3Dmarketsqu=
ote99_news.ht&s=3DAOxv3sBTUTmV3UG93 =20

NATURAL GAS OFFERED AT FIXED RATE - [The Freemont Argus and Oakland Tribune=
, June 5] New York state-based NewPower is offering California residents a =
fixed-rate contract for natural gas, a commodity that saw big price spikes =
this past winter due to a supply shortage.  Residential customers in PG&E's=
 service territory who commit to a two-year contract would pay 98 cents for=
 each therm of natural gas. There would also be a monthly service fee of $2=
.99. http://www.argus-ang.com/default.asp?puid=3D16&spuid=3D16&indx=3D91011=

PRIX FIXE NATURAL GAS NOW AVAILABLE - [Contra Costa Times, June 5.]  With a=
n offer of a two-year price guarantee, NewPower has set out to capture a po=
rtion of the retail natural gas market now served by the bankrupt utility u=
nit of PG&E Corp. http://www.contracostatimes.com/news/leads/stories_one/en=
ron_20010605.htm=20

NEWPOWER OFFERS FIXED RATES - [Gas Daily, June 5.]  Gas customers in Pacifi=
c Gas & Electric's service territory can lock into a fixed rate with NewPow=
er, a subsidiary of New Power Holdings.  The national gas and electric mark=
eter yesterday began to offer  two-year fixed-rate to customers in several =
counties in Northern California.  "NewPower is enormously pleased to provid=
e California consumers, who've been buffeted by volatile energy prices, wit=
h a stable gas contract," said Eugene Lockhart, president and CEO of The Ne=
w Power Co.
SELLING STABLE PRICES WORKS FOR NEWPOWER IN CALIFORNIA - [Restructuring Tod=
ay, June 6.] Yes, the California market is open for retail gas competition.=
  It's been open for maybe a decade but few have found the market attractiv=
e until now.  NewPower is going in selling a two-year fixed price package t=
hat really appeals in today's world of price spiking. The fixed price insul=
ates customers from price spikes in the volatile California marketplace. Ne=
wPower's Terri Cohen relates that the firm expects to sign up 16,000 custom=
ers.  They'll have the opportunity to lock in gas at 98? a therm, compared =
to an average PG&E price last January of $1.40 a therm.  The LDCs change th=
eir price monthly with a filing to the PUC based on what their costs have b=
een.  NewPower's deal is available to retail customers in 37 northern Calif=
ornia counties, including San Francisco and Sacramento. Before the announce=
ment, NewPower already had 600,000 gas and electric customers in 19 markets=
.

SURVEY SHOWS CUSTOMERS OVERWHELMINGLY FAVOR PRICE STABILITY - [Maxim Consul=
ting Press Release, June 1.]  A nationwide survey shows that gas customers =
want their local gas utility to pursue strategies that will prevent future =
price spikes. The survey results also suggest ways for utilities to regain =
customer loyalty diminished in the wake of last winter's price increases. T=
he results of the survey were recently presented to a group of utility exec=
utives and regulators at the New England Conference of Public Utilities Com=
missions. The survey shows that customers overwhelmingly prefer programs th=
at mitigate price volatility, such as fixed price and capped price programs=

SHELL UNIT SIGNS DEAL ON NATURAL GAS PRICES - [Cleveland Plain Dealer, June=
 2.] Shell Energy Services Inc. yesterday became the next big player in Nor=
theast Ohio's quickly changing utility services industry.  The Texas-based =
subsidiary of Shell Energy signed a one-year deal with Northeast Ohio Publi=
c Energy Council to provide discounted natural gas to customers in NOPEC co=
mmunities across eight counties, beginning in September. http://www.clevela=

9 CITIES UNITE FOR GREATER MIGHT  - [Boston Globe, June 3.] Imagine if nine=
 Massachusetts cities combined their muscle to lower their health-care prem=
iums and energy costs, and unify plans for affordable housing and developin=
g jobs.  Those are among the hopes of city leaders who participated in a ne=
w cooperative effort that kicked off Wednesday.  At the meeting, officials =
from Boston, Cambridge, Chelsea, Everett, Malden, Medford, Melrose, Revere,=
 and Somerville discussed ways their communities might be able to better wo=
rk together. Possible areas of collaboration include joint purchasing and f=
orging common strategies. http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/154/north/9_cit=
ies_unite_for_greater_mightP.shtml=20

ON BUSH'S BRAND OF ENERGY DIVERSITY - [TIME.Com, June 4.] The Bush administ=
ration's national energy policy is meant to stimulate a national debate. It=
 is certainly doing that. Whatever you believe about its recommendations, t=
he report is a surprisingly well-crafted overview of America's energy situa=
tion. http://www.time.com/time/business/printout/0,8816,128829,00.html=20

THE BATTLE OF CALIFORNIA - [Newsweek, June 4.] There are two dueling storyl=
ines for California's energy crisis. In the Gray Davis version a noble publ=
ic servant who inherited a flawed electricity deregulation scheme from his =
Republican predecessor is trying to defend California's shellshocked consum=

ilters runs from $39.95 to $59.95, plus shipping and handling.
The EnergyPack offers 300-watts of portable power.  Whether Dad is boating,=
 camping, indoors or outoors, he has a rechargeable generator (think portab=

run his laptop for seven hours.  It is $159.95 plus shipping and handling (=
a more powerful, 600-watt EnergyPack is also available for $279.95).

* * * DELIVERING ON THE STRATEGY - 


NewPower Conducting Three Innovative Energy-Saving Pilot Programs In Philadelphia To Help Consumers Control Their Energy Costs

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 31, 2001-- Some 300 Philadelphia households will soon participate in three pioneering pilot programs that will test consumer's reaction to energy saving technology. 

The programs will be launched next month by The New Power Company(TM), a subsidiary of NewPower Holdings, Inc., with technology and services provided by the Carrier Corporation, Shadowpack Inc., Coactive Networks, National Family Opinion Research (NFO) and Sargent Electric Company. 

The three pilots consisting of 100 households each will include: a time-of-use metering pilot; an HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) load control pilot; and an interactive home gateway pilot. The interactive home gateway pilot will allow consumers to remotely access their thermostat from any Internet-enabled device. 

"As NewPower has advocated since its inception, energy restructuring leads to technological innovation, efficiency and environmental benefits,' said H. Eugene Lockhart, The New Power Company's president and chief executive officer.  "These pilots are a wonderful example of control being shifted from the utility to the consumer. The nation's move to energy restructuring makes it possible for consumers to better manage their energy needs."
 
Here are additional details on each of the three pilots: 
?	Participants in pilot program ``A'' will have time-of-use meters installed in their homes. These meters record daily energy use and will enable 		NewPower to better understand typical energy consumption patterns. 

?	In pilot program ``B,'' the HVAC load control pilot, Carrier's Comfortstat(TM) programmable thermostat will be installed in 100 homes. The purpose 	of this pilot is to gauge customers' reaction to having NewPower remotely alter their thermostat setting by 2 to 6 degrees to help the homeowner 		better manage their energy usage and costs. 

?	Under pilot program ``C,'' NewPower's remote energy management system will allow consumers to change their thermostat setting from any 		Internet-accessible device, including a PC, ``smart'' mobile phone or PDA. However, unlike pilot ``B,'' the customer always remains in control and 		may instantaneously override the adjustment at any time from the Web or a wireless device. 

Sargent Electric Company will install and service the energy management systems throughout the duration of the pilot programs. Their professional installers will complete the system installation in a matter of hours and provide helpful user instruction. 

The pilot programs will run from early June to the end of September -- the peak season for energy consumption. Homeowners are currently being recruited by NFO Research, and, as part of the pilot, will be asked to complete a number of short surveys about how they use the system and their feelings about new product concepts. 

Coactive Networks will provide the heart of the interactive home gateway system in pilot ``C.'' This first-of-its-kind technology uses home networking to enable real-time monitoring and control of devices over the Internet without requiring any new wires in the home. Shadowpack has built the system's Web and wireless user interfaces and will provide the back-end infrastructure necessary to carry out customer requests. Shadowpack's services allow for seamless connectivity from almost any Internet accessible device.

I just read the order.  My congratulations  to each of you as well.  Job well done.  Now hopefully the Commissioners will issue an order consistent with the judges decision.  We all needed some good news!  By the way Drew you should probably come up with a better description of your past experiences than "outhouse lawyer".

I don't think I've ever in my days as an outhouse and inhouse lawyer worked with a team that was so cohesive and effective.  That you guys did it with a group pulled together  from two firms as well as in house lawyers is doubly impressive.  We appreciate the long hours and sacrifices you all made to get  this thing ready and try it in such a short time period.  Your timing is impeccable, as having a little good news about Enron out in the marketplace is sorely needed right now!  Thanks again guys!  DF

Today, the Corporate Secretary Department began receiving large amounts of registered mail which already has been signed for in the mailroom and delivered to us.  Chuck Cheek tells us that his Litigation Group should not receive these letters and will not be directly involved. 

We are just trying to ascertain to whom (individual/department/outside counsel) should this mail be directed.  

When we get an answer, we will pass the word and give the mailroom proper instructions.  It is my understanding that many of the officers on 50 also are receiving these letters.  We will need to notify all of the proper procedure.  

Let me know, and we'll take it from there.

You have confirmed by voice mail that V&E have been retained to defend the recent share holder derivative litigation.  To date, we have been made aware of six (6) lawsuits which have been noticed to underwriters.  

I am receiving requests from V&E for copies of policies and other information and we have responded.  Normally,  V&E would be working through an Enron attorney and we would like to know if internal counsel has been appointed in this matter so that we can provide copies for their file as well. Please advise.

Jarek

We were having some retention problems with Jacek for a variety of reasons.  After discussion in London we decided to increase his package.

I believe it is highly unlikely that Jacek would be interested in working out of the Warsaw office for Enron Poland.

The package is significantly higher than what the industry peers would receive in this position and in this market. I wish we had a chance to discuss this issue internally first.

In case I were to retain him as part of Enron Poland at a later date - I can not justify this level of remuneration as part of my budget.

I have discussed this with Jacek.  The reason for increasing Jacek's package is retention.

propose to the others (in December or January).  Are you in a position

   Jim,

   We need to advise the Executive Committee members that the November 2
   meeting is canceled so they can free next Friday up on their
calendars.

   Shall I send the memo below (after you've added the dates you propose
   and made any other modifications you wish), or would you rather I
   contact them myself and simply tell them to stand by for more
   information?

   Thanks.

   RE: Our Inaugural Meeting

   Due to conflicts in several of our members' schedules, I have
determined
   to re-schedule our inaugural meeting from November 2 to a later date.
I
   hope this does not greatly inconvenience those of you who have
already
   made your plans to attend on the 2nd.

   Rather than simply announcing the new date, I'd like to try to find a
   date suitable for all members. Please advise David Winn (
   <mailto:(dwinn@swlegal.org> dwinn@swlegal.org or 972-664-3488) of
your
   availability on the following dates for our meeting in Dallas - as we
   originally planned, we will begin with a working lunch at 12:00 p.m.
   followed by drinks and an early dinner afterwards:

   a) ____________

   b) ____________

   c) ____________

   d) ____________

   After reviewing your responses, we'll promptly schedule our meeting
for
   the date most convenient to the greatest number of committee members
and
   notify you of the new date.

   Please pardon this change in plans. I do think it is important that
we
   have a full attendance as we chart our course for our first year, and
   I'm looking forward to getting on with our work.

John,

If his schedule allows, I think Ken would be the best person to meet with the PM's secretary. If Ken is not available, I recommend either Jim or me. We do have one conflict in the schedule and that is a meeting called by all the lenders for DPC to attend that is for the week of Nov. 5. We do not know the date, and the location will be either London (our preference) or Singapore. As soon as we know this, I will let you know.

On an interesting side note, the press today reported that AES chairman Dennis Bakke wrote a letter to the Prime Minister in which he said they were increasingly frustrated with doing business in India, that all foreign investors were getting tired of this, and he said he believed that the state gov't of Orissa had EXPROPRIATED their investment. Sounds like he took a page out of Enron's book.

	The Embassy called to confirm that the Indian Prime Minister now plans to be in Washington on November 7.  We talked of a meeting on November 8 with the Secretary of the PMO.  Who would be best to take the meeting? 

	The US-India Business Council is also planning a letter to the PM which would underscore the short time left for negotiations and the need for the GOI to designate a schedule for meeting. One would think the PM would want to have made progress before arriving in Washington, but ...  John

TO: The Executive Committee of the Institute for Law and Technology

FROM: James V. Derrick, Jr., Chair

RE: Our Inaugural Meeting

Due to conflicts in several of our members' schedules, I have determined
to re-schedule our inaugural meeting from November 2 to a later date. I
hope this does not greatly inconvenience those of you who have already
made your plans to attend on the 2nd.

Rather than simply announcing the new date, I'd like to try to find a
date suitable for all members. Please advise David Winn (
<mailto:(dwinn@swlegal.org> dwinn@swlegal.org or 972-664-3488) of your
availability on the following dates for our meeting in Dallas - as we
originally planned, we will begin with a working lunch at 12:00 p.m.
followed by drinks and an early dinner afterwards:

a)  Friday, January 11, 2002

b)  Friday, January 18, 2002

c)  Wednesday, January 23, 2002

After reviewing your responses, we'll promptly schedule our meeting for
the date most convenient to the greatest number of committee members and
notify you of the new date.

Please pardon this change in plans. I do think it is important that we
have a full attendance as we chart our course for our first year, and
I'm looking forward to getting on with our work.

Sent:	Tuesday, October 16, 2001 9:26 AM
To:	All Enron Worldwide@ENRON
Subject:	Third Quarter Earnings Results


Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Rob -

We may be following in their footsteps.  We've publicly said that certain prospective acts (e.g., IFI foreclosure, a buy-out at less than full costs, etc.) would constitute expropriation but have not said publicly that expropriation has already occurred.

AES in Dispute with State in India

U.S.-Based AES Corp. Complains About Getting Paid by Indian State

By RAJESH MAHAPATRA 
Associated Press Writer

NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- AES Corp., a U.S. energy company, is seeking the Indian prime minister's help to settle a dispute over power production with a state government.

In a letter to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, AES president Dennis W. Bakke said his company's determination to continue in India was being tested by the government of the eastern Orissa state.

The letter, a copy of which was made available to The Associated Press on Tuesday, was dated Oct. 1 and appeared to have been faxed to the office of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

AES and another major American power company, Enron Corp. (NYSE:ENE  - news ), have made big investments in India after the government allowed foreign investment in the power sector in the early 1990s.

Houston-based Enron has had problems getting paid for power produced at the plant it helped build in India.

AES, based in Arlington, Va., operates two power plants in Orissa, holds 49 percent of the Orissa Power Generation Corp. and manages the main power distribution company in the state.

In his letter, Bakke told Vajpayee that AES has faced ``expropriation, repeated contract violations, intimidation ... and direct interference with day-to-day management'' by the state government and its agencies. The letter also complained about government-run agencies failing to pay 2.1 billion rupees ($44 million) in bills.

``If the situation faced by AES is not remedied urgently, it will undermine the trust and confidence of foreign investors in India,'' Bakke wrote. ``While AES still remains committed to India as a country it would very much like to serve, our determination to continue is being tested.''

AES has already offered to withdraw from the distribution company -- known as the Central Electricity Supply Company of Orissa. However, it has said that the company will continue with its interests in electricity generation.

The prime minister's office said it was not ready to comment on the report.

In Bhubaneshwar, an Orissa energy department official said when it was persuading AES to continue in the CESCO, the state government had given a verbal commitment that AES would be given an additional 2 percent stake, making the energy firm a major shareholder in the company.

However, the Orissa government had not been able to fulfill its commitment, the official said speaking on condition of anonymity.

If AES decides to pull out completely, it will be the third American company to do so.

Cogentrix Inc. quit a power project in southern India before it was started, while Enron is in the process of withdrawing from the Dabhol Power Project in western Maharashtra state, India's biggest ever foreign investment project.

On Sept. 14, Enron chairman Kenneth L. Lay wrote a letter to Vajpayee threatening legal action to pursue claims of up to $5 billion relating to the Dabhol Power Co. dispute and questioned India's ability to honor its contracts.

Lay had also warned that India may find it hard to attract foreign investors in the future because of the payment dispute with the Dabhol project, which stopped production and construction in May.

Emilio,

I think you should proceed.  Could you send me a resume?

Jim, our two lawyers at Azurix Buenos Aires have needed some assistance in handling routine matters, given that most of Emilio's time is taken up with the termination issues.  The though has been to hire a local lawyer, known to the local team, on a contract basis to help with these items.  There's significant work to help in dealing with pending construction and supply contracts as the concession winds down.  I assume this is OK with you.

John,
I met this lawyer that I mentioned to you again, and she seems to be
ready to manage working for us full-time during a three months period in
order to help us, mainly with the fixing of contractual issues with our
suppliers vis a vis termination / tranfer of the contracts to the
Province / determination of liabilities. The costs would not be high,
and she seems to be (I hope so) a very discreet person (particularly
considering the job she currently has). If you do not have a problem
with this (my only concern is her work at the Municipality), I would ask
her to start working for us on Monday, not on a labour relationship
basis, but rather on a independent professional one (she would bill us
for her services).

     --What do you do when you have to research across state lines?

     --What do you do with a Federal question that properly demands a national look across all thirteen Federal circuits?

Larry, although this transaction has been closed and I see no reason to keep these entities, please also confirm with Ken and D. Shields. By the way, has the transfer to UF been finalized??

Coralina, you'll recall that all of the above companies were set up to be part of the Power Plant/Regasification facility JV with Union Fenosa.  That has died, and these companies are now considered "shelf" companies, with no business and no purpose; however, we cannot keep them as such, since they are costly, I'd like to dissolve them before year-end.

Would you kindly send me a return message with your approval to proceed with dissolving all of the above entities.  I of course will send an annoucement memo company-wide ("Notice of Intent to Dissolve") to give those involved a chance to review and respond back if there is any reason NOT to dissolve them.  I do have one group wanting Enron Dominicana B.V.

Thanks Cora.

I've had a number of discussions with Mary Nell Browning over the last couple of days in relation to opportunities with Enron outside of the Enron Europe legal department, including the possibility of her moving into a commercial role. She is presently talking to a few of my people about this. It did occur to me that there maybe a role for her in Global Assets, commercial or legal and I've suggested that she calls you to discuss.

She tells me that she's presently minded to take the voluntary redundancy offered. I have told her that in her case, I'm prepared to give her the benefit of that package until the end of the year to give her more time to find a role internally, in what is clearly a tough time here.

I would appreciate any help you could give. I will also try and catch up with you to chat about this.

Many thanks



Michael Brown

Excellent. 

Is David also to be the registered agent for the other 5 states in which PGE appears from the data sheets to be licensed to do business? What about PGE subsidiaries? What about Alberta -- I would anticipate that the current Canadian agent would be maintained and that he would interface on SOP directly with David?

I would ask that you provide Becky with a list of the companies by states for which David will serve as registered agent. Also, if David's team is entering the critical case information on LawManager as SOP is received, which I understand they are or plan to do, then we need not ask David to forward a copy of the SOP transmittal sheet to Becky; otherwise, she will need a copy. Of course, should any PGE-related service be received through Becky, she will advise David of same by email and follow-up with hard copies.

Thanks for your assistance.

Are you handling the filing with the Oregon Secretary of State to change PGE's
registered agent to Dave Aamodt?  Also, do you have instructions for us
regarding distribution to Enron of documents served on PGE's registered agent?

We're assuming the change will take effect on June 1.

Rosy's been off for the past few days, so I haven't been able to get an update
from her.

Anything PGE needs to do to make this go smoothly?

Dear James Derrick,

We hope you are now in receipt of preliminary results from Ipsos-Reid's Public Perceptions on Continental Energy as reported in the prestigious National Journal sent on Friday.  As well, we have included a hyperlink to our  November 17th 2001 presentation to the Senate Leadership entitled Public Opinion on Energy Issues and National Energy Policy and the press release resulting from that day's press conference.  Your organization might really benefit from seeing the whole survey, which will be completed shortly after Thanksgiving. This survey is the largest poll ever conducted on public opinion about energy issues in North America. To discuss this further, please contact me, Thomas Riehle, President of Ipsos-Reid U.S. Public Affairs at (202) 463-7300.

I look forward to reviewing this opportunity with you and your organization.

Thom Riehle

                         MEDIA RELEASE
FROM: THE FATIMA CENTER, 266 Elmwood Ave., Buffalo, NY 14222
CONTACT: Coralie Graham, 905-871-7607 or coraliegraham@softcom.ca
OR WEBSITE: www.fatima.org
26 October 2001 - FOR RELEASE: IMMEDIATE

"RALLY AGAINST TERRORISM" SET FOR NEW YORK
Mid-November prayer campaign targets 6 million Catholics

Thousands of Catholics in New York and around the world believe
that the terrorist attack against the World Trade Center was
prophesied by the Blessed Virgin Mary to three shepherd children
at Fatima, Portugal, on July 13th, 1917. A Rally Against
Terrorism, to be held at New York's Hotel Pennsylvania, from
Saturday, November 10th through Monday, November 12th, will offer
New Yorkers the chance to do something positive to make world
leaders listen to the Fatima Message.
     The Blessed Virgin Mary said, "If My requests are not
granted ... the good will be martyred, the Holy Father will have
much to suffer, various nations will be annihilated." According
to Father Nicholas Gruner, the "Fatima Priest", this foretells
tragic events like those of September 11th. "This is it!", he
says, "This is what Our Lady tried to warn us about."
     The Rally Against Terrorism is being held in New York
because, the organizers say, of the nearly 300 million Americans
who are at risk of annihilation, New Yorkers should be the most
aware of the death and destruction which can be rained on us from
the skies or delivered through the mail. The only thing we can do
to protect ourselves, they say, is to pray and campaign for
obedience to the Message of Fatima.
     Attenders at the rally will hear seven distinguished
speakers, including Father Gruner, explain the simple, step-by-
step instructions Our Lady gave us for averting an even worse
disaster. "Everything else has been tried," the Fatima Priest
says. "We have nothing to lose, and world peace to gain, by
insisting that the Pope and all the bishops do what Our Lady of
Fatima has commanded." Participants will be urged to play their
part in making this happen.
     There will also be opportunities to join in Masses, Rosaries
and other prayerful devotions offered up in remembrance of those
who have died and for the protection of the living.
     Admission to the Rally Against Terrorism is free. Sessions
are scheduled from 8:45 a.m. until 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, Sunday
and Monday, November 10th through 12th, at New York's Hotel
Pennsylvania, 401 - 7th Avenue, between 32nd and 33rd Streets.
Further information can be found on the Fatima Website:
www.fatima.org.
                                                            - 30 -
NOTE TO MEDIA: We especially invite members of the press--
including electronic media as well as print- to attend and cover
the Rally Against Terrorism. For more information, contact Arthur
Skinner or Coralie Graham at the Fatima Center, telephone 1-866-
871-7723, or, outside North America, +1-905-871-7607, or e-mail
Coralie Graham, coraliegraham@softcom.ca.

Jim:

I wanted to take a moment and wish you and Carrin the best for the holiday
season.  Goodness knows we have all had an extraordinary '01-- I am guessing
this has been a year unlike any other for you and your family.  Here's to a
very healthy and happy '02.

Let's get together in the new year when you have a moment to focus on your
personal matters. Until then, should you need anything please let me know.

Regards.

Jim-I interviewed David Lang today for a summer clerkship and liked him a
lot.  Thanks for encouraging him to see K&S

Shall we try to reschedule our lunch, or do a golf game?  How's your
schedule looking?

All the best.

APPEALS COURT ASKED TO STAY RULING VACATING HAZARDOUS AIR
POLLUTANT RULES

EPA joins with the Sierra Club and industry petitioners in
asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit to stay a decision vacating hazardous air
pollutant standards for hazardous waste combustors. The
joint motion seeks to allow EPA to implement interim
standards while it formulates a new rule setting forth
permanent standards, according to an attorney representing
industry plaintiffs. . . . Page A-1

W.R. GRACE TO PAY $2.75 MILLION TO SETTLE SUIT OVER ACCESS
TO MINE

W.R. Grace & Co. will spend $2.75 million on additional
health care benefits for residents in Libby, Mont., to
settle a dispute with federal agencies over access to the
company's vermiculite mining operations. EPA says the
agreement also calls for Grace to pay $71,000 in fines for
denying the agency full access to property that housed the
former mine. EPA gained full access rights to the property
in March when the U.S. District Court for the District of
Montana ordered the company to allow access to the
properties for investigation and cleanup work by the
government. . . . Page A-1

SHIPPERS WANT FEDERAL INVOLVEMENT IN ANY FUTURE RAILROAD
MORATORIUM

Railroad customers who ship hazardous materials are calling
for federal coordination if terrorist activities prompt
another moratorium on the transportation of certain
dangerous chemical shipments by rail. After the Association
of American Railroads restricted the movement of sensitive
types of cargo earlier in October, critics charge the abrupt
moratorium left shippers in the lurch and placed the
responsibility on shippers to determine the exact
restrictions on certain poison-by-inhalation chemicals,
which varied from railroad to railroad. Should a similar
moratorium be needed in the future, the National Industrial
Transportation League recommends it be handled and
coordinated by the federal government. . . . Page A-4

CHANGES URGED FOR GUIDANCE TO IMPROVE ECOLOGICAL RISK
ASSESSMENTS

Draft recommendations to help risk analysts improve
ecological risk assessments should be revised to make them
more useful, says a federal advisory board in a draft
report. EPA's Risk Assessment Forum develops the guidance,
"Planning for Ecological Risk Assessment: Developing
Management Objectives," to complement the "Guidelines for
Ecological Risk Assessment" issued by the agency in 1998.
Such guidance documents are used by companies, state
agencies, and other organizations when conducting risk
assessments. . . . Page A-3

ONTARIO ISSUES NEW RULES TO LIMIT AIR POLLUTION FROM POWER
PLANTS

New emission limits for electric utilities that burn fossil
fuels are an aggressive step in the Ontario government's
efforts to fight air pollution, says its provincial
Environment Minister Elizabeth Witmer. The phased-in limits
for Ontario's electricity generating sector will take effect
Jan. 1, and, when fully implemented in 2007, will help
Canada to meet its commitments under the Ozone Annex to the
Canada-U.S. Air Quality Agreement, says Witmer. She says
Ontario's new regulations include an emissions trading
system for the electricity generating sector that will
create an incentive for Ontario businesses and
municipalities to further reduce pollution. . . . Page A-5

EPA FINDS USE OF BIOREMEDIATION INCREASING AT SUPERFUND
SITES

The use of bioremediation projects to clean up superfund
sites is increasing because the technologies are less
expensive than conventional remedies. In "Use of
Bioremediation at Superfund Sites", EPA says, of the 1,106
superfund sites at which the agency has made a decision on
the cleanup remedy, bioremediation activities are taking
place at 78, or 7 percent of the sites. . . . Page A-2

A scientific advisory panel recommends EPA conduct a more
complex probabilistic risk assessment for its review of wood
treated with the pesticide chromated copper arsenate, rather
than the simplified approach it chose. A panel member says
EPA could adopt a modeling approach like the one it
developed for assessing risks posed by pesticides found in
food under the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. The
recommendation by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
Rodenticide Act Scientific Advisory Panel comes as the panel
reviews components of the agency's preliminary assessment of
hazard and exposures for children from playground equipment
treated with chromated copper arsenate. . . . Page A-8

LAKESHORE PROPERTY OWNERS FILE SUIT OVER RUNOFF FROM CHICKEN
FARMS

A group of lakeshore property owners file a lawsuit against
Tyson Foods Inc. in Oklahoma state court alleging poultry
waste from the company's operations pollute the lake to

shorefront property at Grand Lake O' the Cherokees in
northeastern Oklahoma near the Missouri border. According to
their suit, the lake is polluted by poultry waste from a
Tyson Foods chicken-processing plant in Noel, Mo., and by
runoff from Tyson Foods chicken farms located in the
watershed of Grand Lake. . . . Page A-9

WORLD BANK REPORT TOUTS IMPORTANCE OF HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT

A healthy environment is critical to reducing worldwide
poverty, which will help to ensure development activities
are sustainable and do not deplete natural resources, says
the World Bank in its annual environmental review. The
report estimates some developing countries lose 4 percent to
6 percent of their gross domestic product because of losses
in productivity and natural capital resulting from
environmental degradation. . . . Page A-6

Dear All,

With reference to Art 14.2 (11) of the Articles of Association the Management Board wishes to ask the Supervisory Board for written consent to assign the rights of ownership of motor vehicle Alfa Romeo (reg - RLE 400) to the insurers PZU to enable them to pay compensation to ENS for the theft of the vehicle. Should the vehicle now be found, the property rights to the vehicle will reside with PZU.
