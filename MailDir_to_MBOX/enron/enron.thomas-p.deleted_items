The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 17:00 and 21:00 in the January 28,
2002 Real-Time Market.

Prices in the January 29, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

Aaron Breidenbaugh <aaron@global2000.net> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Greetings,

FERC ALJ Young has issued his eagerly anticipated report on Northeast
RTO formation.

Subscribers may obtain a copy of the report, business plan, and
appendices here:

http://www.iso-navigator.com/NERTO_Business_Plan_Final.pdf

Judge Young recommends the appointment of settlement judges for the
post-mediation "going forward" process and refrains from advocating any
particular governance structure or stakeholder processes apart from
tallying the number of stakeholder supporters for each.

Over the objections of the largest group of stakeholders, including PJM,
as well as virtually all generators and marketers, the Judge advocates
Option 1-M concerning market design issues. He cites with favor its
incorporation of "best practices" from NYISO and ISO-NE and criticizing
Option 3-M's failure to identify best practices, "let alone implement
them". Option 1-M is the option favored by NYISO and ISO-NE and
anticipates end-state implementation by Q3 2004. It is described in
Appendix B of the Business Plan.

The Judge implies in his criticism of the very aggressive Option 3-M
that some of its supporters at least "would sacrifice optimal RTO market
benefits in the long term to exploit more immediate economic opportunity
in a sprint". He also notes that "PJM was unwilling during the mediation
to concede that any practice pre-identified by another ISO in fact
constituted a best practice." The following statement is especially
noteworthy:

"I left the mediation confident that the PJM paradigm will prove a more
than adequate platform for the Northeastern RTO- provided it
incorporates essential best elements from the other ISOs, and provided
further that impatience, haste and greed are not permitted to drive RTO
implementation at the expense of sound policy."

Although he takes no position on whether the RTO CEO or Board members
should have to resign their current positions, the Judge does advocate a
an RTO-dedicated staff that does not work for the existing ISOs. He also
acknowledged the fact that the mediation process "decidedly
disadvantaged" smaller, newer entities, and that the Commission needs to
address this problem in the post-mediation process.

The report notes the technical difficulties likely to be faced in
scaling up the PJM platform to the entire Northeast and the vagaries of
NY and NE:

"None of the software experts whom I consulted believes the Northeastern
RTO will require an entirely new software system.  Neither does any of
them believe that any currently-employed software is capable of managing
a system as large and complex as the RTO.   The Northeastern RTO will
constitute the largest energy market in the world.  The complexity of
the technology it will take to implement and administer that market is
staggering.  I learned during the course of the mediation that the
complexity of electric system management software is second only to that
of the banking industry.  I also learned that there are very, very few
vendors who design such software, and those vendors have a tremendous
economic incentive to overestimate their/their software's capabilities
to secure such lucrative contracts.  Once entrenched, moreover, it would
be exceedingly difficult and expensive to switch vendors in the event
the original software proved inadequate.  And that would be the least of
the problems.

Accordingly, it is my strong recommendation that independent,
non-vendor, experts be involved in the technology assessment from the
outset.  These experts should be involved in both the IT and
applications technologies assessments, and should be required to
demonstrate that they have no financial interest whatsoever in the
outcomes of those assessments.  This will assure that the RTO has the
advantage of continuing and unbiased expert opinions with respect to
software provider representations and capabilities throughout the
assessment process and beyond."

(Left unstated was the fact that PJM itself is the software vendor of
the PJM platform.)

The ALJ strongly advocates that the Commission preclude comments on the
Report or, alternatively, that if comments are allowed, replies should
be permitted.

Aaron

(Copies of this email are being circulated to the TIE list as a public
service.)

Subject:	A piece of history- 1987




  Subject: Do you remember this?  Ollie made the headlines in
  1987 and was laughed at by the News Media.

 IT WAS 1987!

 At a lecture the other day they played an old video of Lt.
 Col. Oliver North testifying at the Iran-Contra hearings during the
 Reagan administration.

 There was Ollie in front of God and country getting the third degree.
 But what he said was stunning!!
 He was being drilled by some senator; "Did you not recently spend close
 to $60,000 for home security system?"

 Ollie replied, "Yes I did sir." The senator continued, trying to get a
 laugh out of the audience," Isn't this just a little excessive?" "No
 sir," continued Ollie.

 "No? And why not?" the senator asked.

 "Because the lives of my family and I were threatened sir."

 "Threatened? By whom?" the senator questioned.

 "'By a terrorist, sir." Ollie answered.

 "Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that much?"

 "His name is Osama bin Laden sir." Ollie replied.

 At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but
 couldn't pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A
 couple of people laughed at the attempt. Then the senator continued.

 "Why are you so afraid of this man?" the senator asked.

 "Because sir, he is the most evil person alive that I know
 of," Ollie answered.

 "And what do you recommend we do about him?" asked the senator.
 "Well sir, if it were up to me, I would recommend that an
 assassin team be formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of
 the earth."

 The senator disagreed with this approach and that was all that
 was shown of the clip.

 If anyone is interested, the Senator turned out to be none
 other than Al Gore.

	   The five million gallon per year ethanol plant began construction
back in August of 2001 and after a heat exchanger is put into service,
Plover plans to begin producing ethanol from a variety of feedstocks.
The plant was originally designed to process two million bushels per
year of corn seed into the synthetic fuel but it will also have the
capability of utilizing cheese whey and potato waste feedstocks to
produce alcohol.
	   Situated in a region heavily populated by dairy and cheese plants,
Plover intends to capitalize on its location by accepting cheese whey,
a by-product of cheese processing and producing an additional two to
three million gallons per year of alcohol utilizing waste heat from
the main plant. Additional equipment such as an expanded distillation
system will be added to accommodate the additional throughput.
	   They will have the competitive advantage of using low-cost
industry byproducts instead of higher-price corn as feedstocks. When
the plant begins commercial operation, area cheese-makers will have a
constructive alternative to disposing of their whey on farm fields, an
environmentally questionable practice.
	   The plant is situated in central Wisconsin, roughly 80 miles west
of Green Bay in the small town of Plover in Portage County. The 100
foot tall elevator structure can be seen on the Wisconsin horizon from
miles away. The facility will also be the first ethanol plant in
operation in the state since the mid 1980's.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides a comprehensive Ethanol Production
Package (http://www.industrialinfo.com/esemdethanolpp.htm) that
outlines all current development activities in the emerging ethanol
market place. This database covers 60 ethanol plants currently in
operation and 62 plants under development. For more information on

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Distrigas Nears Completion of Its East
Coast Liquefied Natural Gas -- LNG -- Receiving Terminal Expansion, in
an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 29, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Incorporated; Houston). Distrigas of Massachusetts Corporation
(Boston) a subsidiary of Tractebel (Brussels, Belgium) is currently
expanding its Everett LNG receiving terminal in Massachusetts. The
current 435 million cubic feet per day capacity will be increased to
over 1.1 billion cubic feet per day and is scheduled to receive its
first new expansion tanker load on March 1, 2002.
	   Kvearner (London) was awarded the engineering contract and
Tractebel coordinated the E+P+C contract. Ground was broken on the
expansion project in February of 2001. The heart of the $125+ million
expansion is the addition of four new 150 million cubic feet per day
Kaldair model submerged combustion vaporizers and two new NOx units
utilizing ammonia as a catalyst for the removal of nitrous-oxide. The
expansion capacity is already contracted to a 1,800 mega-watt
gas-fired power plant currently under construction in the area. Once
completed, the expansion will make the Everett LNG terminal the
largest LNG terminal on the East Coast and the first in a line of
expansions and new facilities that could add up to an investment of
$3.2 to $4 billion before the end of 2005.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Hydro Aluminum Investment in North
American Secondary Aluminum Sector to Exceed $100 Million, in an
Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 21, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston). Despite a somewhat depressed secondary aluminum market,
Hydro Aluminum Metal Products North America (Louisville, Ky.) a
subsidiary of Norsk Hydro ASA (NYSE:NHY) (Oslo, Norway) will spend
over $100 million on new facilities over a five year period. As part
of a continuing strategy to expand its international network of
secondary aluminum smelters, which includes five in Europe, Hydro
Aluminum has started construction of its second grassroot North
American secondary aluminum smelter to be located in Commerce, Texas.
The $37 million plant is scheduled to start operations late this year.
The plant will produce 90,000 metric tons a year of aluminum billet
from recycled scrap for sale to extruders and other aluminum end
users.
	   2001 was an active year for Hydro, not only did they open their
first grassroot secondary aluminum smelter in Henderson, Ky., they
also acquired Wells Aluminum and its associated secondary smelter in
Monett, Mo. This will give the company three secondary aluminum
smelters with a total capacity of 260,000 metric tons starting in 2003
when the Commerce plant will be in full operation. The company has
plans on the drawing board for a fourth smelter to supply the
northeastern U.S., once market conditions necessitate the demand. As
competitors have downsized recently, Hydro Aluminum has gone against
the grain utilizing its industry experience and energy efficient
technology to become a world leader in the aluminum billet market.
	   Norsk Hydro is an industrial leader-based in Norway and focused on
world growth of oil and gas resources, light metals and agricultural.

Kim, we would like to extend a formal offer to Reagan J. Mathews who is currently working for Enron Broadband.  Please forward the formal documentation to Reagan so that the transfer to East Power can take place.

TJ, if you could find out who Reagan's assistant and HR representative are and fax the documentation to the appropriate persons so that he can join our group.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Subject:  FW: Martha Stewart's Redneck Etiquette

Security Level:?         Internal



tips for rednecks

1. Never take a beer to a job interview.
2. Always identify people in your yard before shooting them.
3. It's tacky to take a cooler to church.
4. If you have to vacuum the bed, it's time to change the sheets.
5. Even if you're certain you're included in the will, it's rude to drive
the
U-Haul to the funeral home.

DINING OUT:
1. When decanting wine from the box, tilt the paper cup and pour slowly so
as
not to "bruise" the wine.
2. If drinking directly from the bottle, hold it with your hands.

ENTERTAINING IN YOUR HOME:
1. A centerpiece for the table should never be anything prepared by a
taxidermist.
2. Don't allow the dog to eat at the table, no matter how good his
manners.

PERSONAL HYGIENE:
1. While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this should be done in private,
using one's OWN truck keys.
2. Even if you live alone, deodorant isn't a waste of money.
3. Use of toiletries can only delay bathing a few days.
4. Dirt and grease under the fingernails is a no-no, as they detract from a
woman's jewelry and alter the taste of finger foods.

DATING (Outside the Family):
1. Always offer to bait your date's hook, especially on the 1st date.
2. Be assertive. Let her know you're interested: "I've been wanting to go
out
with you since I read that stuff on the bathroom wall 2 years ago".
3. Establish with her parents what time she's expected back. Some will say
10:00
PM, others might say "Monday." If the latter is the answer, it's the man's
responsibility to get her to school on time.

THEATER ETIQUETTE:
1. Crying babies should be taken to the lobby and picked up after the
movie's
ended.
2. Refrain from talking to characters on the screen. Tests have proven they
can't hear you.

WEDDINGS:
1. Livestock is a poor choice for a wedding gift.
2. Kissing the bride for more than 5 seconds may get you shot.
3. For the groom, at least, rent a tux. A leisure suit with a cumberbund
and a clean bowling shirt can create a tacky appearance.
4. Though uncomfortable, say "yes" to socks and shoes for the occasion.

DRIVING ETIQUETTE:
1. Dim your headlights for approaching vehicles, even if the gun's
loaded and the deer's in sight.
2. When approaching a 4-way stop, the vehicle with the largest tires doesn't
always have the right of way.
3. Never tow another car using panty hose and duct tape.
4. When sending your wife down the road with a gas can, it's impolite to ask
her
to bring back beer, too.
5. Don't lay rubber while traveling in a funeral procession.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Jacobs Ranch Coal Mine Expands to Meet
Demand for Low Sulfur Coal, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 24, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, Texas). Kennecott Energy Company, a subsidiary of Rio Tinto
(NYSE:RTP), is ramping up production at its Jacobs Ranch coal mine
from 29 million tons up to 41 million tons annually by the end of
2002. The production ramp up will utilize existing infrastructure,
although some mine haulage trucks will be added. Production of Powder
River Basin coal has skyrocketed in recent years due to high demand
for low sulfur coal at power plants. The low sulfur coal burns cleaner
and is cheaper to mine than other types of coal. The Jacobs Ranch coal
mine, located in the Powder River coal basin in Wyoming, is the fourth
largest coal mine in North America.
	   Kennecott Energy is also expanding its coal reserve base in
Wyoming. The company recently announced the acquisition of the North
Jacobs Tract for $379.5 million. The acquisition will add
approximately 537 million tons of coal reserves and will extend the
life of the Jacobs Ranch Mine. Long term development plans for the
North Jacobs Ranch tract include constructing a 2.5 mile overland
conveyor from the tract to existing facilities at Jacobs Ranch, but
officials say it will be 2007 or 2008 before that happens.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including forecasts, outlooks, industry alerts, and
databases for the energy and industrial markets. For more information
on trends and upcoming construction activities for the Metals &
Minerals or Energy markets as well as other industrial sectors send

market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants,

The following software updates will become active on October 30, 2001.

The NYISO web infrastructure will be enhanced through the
implementation of BEA's WebLogic product. The new application
server will be the platform utilized by the MIS to provide
bidding and scheduling capability to Internet customers. The
new software replaces the NetDynamics product, will provide
the same functionality, and will be a more robust and reliable
development platform for future enhancements.

Enhancements will be made to the software that generates the
Pre-MGF (Master Generator File) file used by transmission owners
in the event of a Backup Dispatch System (BDS) activation. The
enhancements will ensure more accurate operation of the BDS system.

The NYISO web page will be modified to add a ticker function
that displays the real-time load information.

Multiple preliminary software changes will be made to the MIS,
SPIDER, and BAS systems in preparation for the activation of
Virtual Bidding in the NYISO energy markets on November 1, 2001.
Activation of Virtual Bidding is pending approval by the FERC.


If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
representatve
or the Help Desk at 518-356-6060.

Customer Relations

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Is the Deep South the ``Detroit'' of the
Auto Making Industry for the 21st Century?, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 30, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Incorporated; Houston, Texas) Is the dominance of Detroit, MI and the
Midwest in the auto making industry nearing an end? At least a half
dozen major auto manufacturers are either looking at, or have already
built, auto-manufacturing facilities in states such as Mississippi,
Alabama, and South Carolina. Along with the new auto-manufacturing
facilities come the inevitable Tier-1 and Tier-2 support plants that
provide the parts and supplies necessary to manufacture automobiles.
The southern states are pulling out all the stops, through economic
benefits packages, to attract the automobile manufacturers and their
support structure to these non-traditional states in an effort to
boost local economies. At stake are billions of dollars and thousands
of jobs in the lucky state or states that can attract the lucrative
auto making businesses.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Expansion Plan Ensures that the Virginia
Port Authority Remains Competitive in the 21st Century, in an Advisory
by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 16, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Incorporated; Houston, Texas) In 1995, Virginia Port Authority (VPA)
was faced with a dilemma. A key question was asked: What steps needed
to be taken to ensure the VPA maintained its market share among
competing US East Coast ports? To answer that question, VPA
commissioned a study to be done by a consulting team of maritime
experts. The results of this study would provide VPA with insight into
what steps needed to be taken to meet their long-term goals.
	   The study was completed in June of 1995 and entitled "The VPA 2010
Plan." The Plan focuses on two (2) key areas: Maximizing existing
port-wide cargo handling capabilities and developing new or improved
facilities to handle the market needs of the future. According to the
study, VPA has the potential for a possible 250% increase in
containerized cargo (potential Intermodel volume increase of 300%) by
the year 2010. In addition, breakbulk cargo could increase by 200% in
the same timeframe.
	   To be capable of handling these potential increases in port
capacity, VPA had to take a hard, serious look at its existing
facilities. It was determined that each of their three (3) cargo
terminals would need renovations and expansions future growth.
	   The largest renovation/expansion would have to take place at their
Norfolk International Terminal (NIT). However, renovation/expansion
work would also be taking place at the Newport News Marine Terminal
(NNMT) and the Portsmouth Marine Terminal (PMT).
	   All total, VPA is initially looking at over $334 million worth of
improvements and expansions to help attract the more then 16 million
tons of general cargo forecasted for VPA by 2010. Some of the work
planned includes Intermodel Container transfer facility
renovations/expansions at NIT, a new 4,000 ft wharf at NIT, additional
container/gantry cranes at NIT, NNMT and PMT, the development of an
additional 250 acres of container storage at NIT, the renovation of 81
acres at NIT, the development of an additional 41 acres of container
storage at PMT, additional berths added at NNMT, plus miscellaneous
modifications and renovations at all three (3) terminals.
	   When it is all said and done, VPA is taking the steps necessary to
position themselves as best they can to take advantage of their
potential future to the fullest. Investments, such as those mentioned
above, will ensure that VPA has the capability to maintain their
competitive edge for years to come and hopefully allow them to
increase their market share by 2010.
	   The Port of Virginia is among the largest and most successful
ports on the East Coast. The three (3) VPA Terminals trade with more
then 100 nations and account for an estimated 116,000 jobs throughout
Virginia.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) The State of Food & Beverage 2001
Spending, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 16, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, Texas). As the Food & Beverage Industry continues
restructuring to find growth, mergers, acquisitions and consolidation
are shrinking the industry. In recent years, food processors have
shown ravenous appetites for acquiring smaller companies that can help
increase their market share and improve efficiencies. Five of the
biggest industry players control about 50% of sales in the United
States.
	   Since improved efficiency is one of the typical reasons for
mergers and consolidations, often the result is the closure of
less-efficient plants. Once that process begins, there are many
related decisions that need to be made that quite often can lead to
decisions regarding the consolidation of other facilities in a company
and sometimes replacing an aging facility with new construction.
	   Since the beginning of the year, Industrialinfo.com has been
tracking activities in mergers and acquisitions and also plant
closings. 141 plants in the US and Canada have closed their doors and
over 85 major mergers/acquisitions have been made with more in the
works or pending for the year 2001.
	   Excess production capacity has become a problem in some parts of
the food industry, such as grain processing and meat production. The
primary reason industry experts say is a decline in foreign demand,
partly due to increasing production by processors in South America and
Asia, particularly China.
	   Companies seeking to construct new facilities are also facing more
stringent state and local regulations regarding air emissions and
water pollution. Given the increasing capital investment, food
processors are more likely to expand, when possible, rather than build
new plants.
	   IIR's capital spending and MRO projections for 2001 are at $13.8
billion. In the top 45 publicly held companies, spending projections
are estimated at $11 billion, up 1.1% over 2000 projections. Over two
thirds of capital spending is happening within existing facilities
with money being spent mainly on production, packaging and process
control equipment. Improvements in automation and information
integration are the major trend impacting capital spending over the
next five years.

market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
and industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming
construction activities in the Food & Beverage industry as well as

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The NYISO Back-Up Dispatch System  is scheduled to be tested on Tuesday,
January 8 ,2002.  The test will begin at about 10:30 a.m. and last for
approximately one hour.

Security Constrained Dispatch (SCD) will be stopped, but the mainframe
computer will continue to operate, allowing the NYISO to monitor security.
If a situation occurs, the Shift Supervisor will be able to re-start SCD
and take appropriate action.  The Market Information System (MIS) and
Balancing Market Evaluation (BME) will remain available during the test.

If you have any questions, please call Customer Relations at 518-356-6060.

	Course # 7129-01:  Thursdays, Oct 18 - Dec 13 (no class Nov 22)
PLEASE NOTE that the two schedules are not interchangeable; employees should

Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their own fees.

HOW TO ENROLL:
	1.  Print out the attached registration form.
	2.  Complete the form, but please note the following 
		SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
		A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
			your email address.
		B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says "Please enroll
			me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________",

The next courses at the Princeton Review office start the week of October 20.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or for future schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
	The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your
application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially
improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
	All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour,
of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.  The
Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

On Saturday, 11/17, the Operational Announcements  state that both Roseton units would be committed for Local  Reliability on Sunday.  I have two questions concerning this  commitment; 1) What happened after SCUC ran that required two 600 mw units be  put on at minimum?  2) Since the local Transmission Owner didn't request  these units on, why is it referred to as Local Reliability?  There is a  substantial amount of uplift generated ( no pun intended ) by this decision and  when the term Local Reliability is used it raises a question as to the  allocation of this cost.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Energy Producers Continue Expansion
Plans Despite Cautious Market in 2002, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 17, 2002--The following is an
advisory by IndustrialInfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc;
Houston). It seems as though it was just yesterday that the California
energy crisis was reaching catastrophic proportions and Governor Davis
(CA) had all but deemed Houston the evil empire of the universe. All
eyes were on the states with deregulation looming on the horizon and
wondering if the next deregulated state would follow in the steps of
California. State governors and a newly elected Bush Administration
were scrambling for answers to prevent a regional crisis from becoming
a national nightmare. Prior to that Industrial Information Resources
had identified over 300,000 megawatts of new generation either under
construction or in various stages of planning and development. The
solution then was to build more power plants and add new capacity.
Also in response to the shortfall of energy production, the National
Energy Policy estimated the need for 1,300 new power plants to meet
future demand. Developers responded in kind, taking an aggressive
approach to meet our new electrical needs by developing and building
new power plants at alarming rates.
	   Wow! What a difference a year makes. Due to new capacity, milder
seasons and a shaky economy, lower demand and prices are causing some
to question the validity of the national energy crisis. No less than
seven states have delayed deregulation placing in question the future
developments of some new plants. Our economy, already in recession
took a nose-dive after the tragic events of Sept. 11, 2001, further
reducing demand primarily from industrial and commercial customers. To
close out the year we witnessed the demise of the Enron Corporation,
which could have far-reaching effects in the industry. As a result
many developers are heading into 2002 with a more cautious approach to
constructing new power plants.
	   On Wednesday one of the most aggressive developers in the
industry, Calpine Corporation (NYSE:CPN) (San Jose, Calif.) outlined
their revised future development program in a conference call hosted
by Pete Cartwright (chairman, CEO & president), Robert Kelly
(president of Calpine Finance), Charles Clark (senior VP & corporate
controller) and other members of Calpine's management team. Calpine
announced plans for completion of twenty-seven projects representing
15,200MW currently under construction. "Upon completion of
construction of this program, Calpine will have a portfolio of
26,300MW of the most efficient power plants in the United States by
the end of 2003," stated Cartwright. Plans are to proceed with
thirty-four projects in advanced development accounting for 15,100MW
of capacity. Development of these projects will be completed to a
point where they are ready to begin construction and then will be
placed in "hot standby" according to Mr. Cartwright. "We have ordered
all these projects be put on hold and no capital spending will take
place until we have had opportunities to do a thorough review of each
project." Calpine had planned to spend about $2 Billion on advanced
projects in 2002. "We intend to keep going with these projects when
conditions are right. We do not intend to have any significant
cancellations." Plans are to continue with approximately 30,000MW in
early development originally scheduled to be completed by 2006. In
contrast, Cartwright says a number of his competitors are cancelling
and selling off their projects. In his address, Mr. Cartwright also
commented on the status of power markets, availability of capital and
earnings. "Our goal, as it's always been, is to grow Calpine to become
the largest and most profitable power generator in North America."
	   Calpine is certainly not the only power plant developer to
announce revised programs for the coming year. Companies such as NRG
Energy, Dynegy and El Paso Merchant Energy have also announced a
review of their strategies. Research conducted by Industrial
Information Resources has identified over 50,000MW of cancelled
projects since June of 2001, including projects by PPL and Mirant.
"While this is a major contrast from the beginning of 2001, all we
need is a speedy economic recovery, a harsh winter and a scorching
summer and it could be deja vu all over again," according to Britt
Burt manager of power market research for Industrial Information
Resources.

Iris,

I agree with Rob that the course is a little light relative to the time spent.  The course material is on the web and I suggest going through this.  I would also include Paul Thomas in your resource list and recommend spending some time with Paul and the Northeast Physical group.  They live and breath this market daily.

Tom.

Hi,

	I came across a workshop which discusses all the aspects of NYISO' s operation - see email below.  

	Some of the transmission guys suggested that Enron should be represented at this conference.

	However, Rob Stalford says that you guys are able to tell us everything we need to know about the new NYISO regulatory environment. 

Thanks,
Iris

Hello Everyone,

The Oracle DBA team would like request NetCo production database downtime starting tomorrow Thursday 01/31/2002 at
10am to perform database reorg.  This reorg is important to ensure efficient data access after the data cleansing effort.

Attached is the summary of the reorg work and the estimated downtime.  All NetCo production databases will be ready
no later than Friday 02/01/2002 at 7am if not earlier.

 
Please response with your approval by COB today.  If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me or your dbas.

Thanks,
Mable

Dear Power Outage Database Customer,

Attached you will find an excel document. The outages contained within
are forced or rescheduled outages. Your
daily delivery will still contain these outages.

In addition to the two excel documents, there is a dbf file that is

No it is through expedia, we would have to call american airlines and ask
how much the ticket is by itself and pay it of w/ the credit we have w/
them. From what I have seen $1000.00 will be ticket price then we would have
to pay the rest (hotel and lift ticket)

Did you get my e-mail about benefits?
I also looked for Phoenix I foun for $280.00 (COntinental) & $399.00
(American)

Love

I understand there was a problem on my desk this week with a market that was
posted and executed on by one of our traders. I was not in the office and a
decision was made for the trade to stand.

I apologize if there was a lack of professionalism at this end. We do a lot of
business with Enron and  I am interested in keeping a working business
relationship.

Please include me in any discrepancies with our real-time traders and their
accounts: pplhourly(1-8).

A small deal,as I see it you owe us a jab...and I won't be asking for any
favors any time soon.

thanks

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) US Energy Partners Commissions
Milo-to-Ethanol Plant In Russell, Kansas, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors & Energy Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 22, 2002--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Incorporated;
Houston, Texas). US Energy Partners LLC (Russell, KS) have completed
construction of a $30 plus million ethanol plant in Kansas that will
produce fuel grade ethanol from some 9 million bushels of milo
feedstock annually.
	   When fully commissioned in February of this year, the plant will
produce 25 million gallons per year of fuel grade ethanol. US Energy
Partners have also entered an agreement with Williams Bio-Energy
(Pekin, Ill.) to market all of the ethanol to be produced at the plant.
	   The plant will also receive process steam from the City of
Russell's new 15MW (mega-watt) cogeneration power plant that is
currently under construction near the site. The steam will be utilized
to dry the distillers grain by-product produced during the process of
making ethanol.
	   The facility is located roughly 220 miles west of Kansas City,
Kansas.
	   Jay Brunson, IIR's Synthetic Fuels Manager added, "US Energy is
the fifth operational ethanol plant in Kansas. Currently about 37
million gallons per year of ethanol come out of Kansas. Four
additional ethanol plants are currently underdevelopment and when they
come on line in 2003, the state will have the capacity of producing
about 152 million gallons annually."
	   Industrial Information Resources has developed an exclusive
real-time database for the ethanol industry. The Ethanol Production
Package (http://www.industrialinfo.com/esemdethanolpp.htm) provides a
comprehensive outline of all current development activities in the
emerging ethanol market place. This database covers 60 ethanol plants
currently in operation and 62 plants under development.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including alerts on industry and business trends and
project activity. For more information on upcoming construction
activities in the Synthetic Fuels industry as well as other industrial
sectors send inquiries to synfuelsgroup@industrialinfo.com or visit us

Malaysia For Asian Markets, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 10, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources
Incorporated, Houston). Two petrohemical projects worth $100 million
are now being launched in Malaysia by Sasol, the South African
petrochemicals and synfuels company. The first plant going on stream
at Kernith is a cracker for the production of ethylene and propylene
from natural gas. It will produce 600,000 tons of ethylene and 85,000
tons of propylene per annum. Sasol has a 12% interest in this plant,
with Malaysia's Petronas taking 64% and the U.S. company Dow 24%.
	   The adjacent plant at Petilin will produce 255,000 tons of
low-density polyethylene a year and will service markets in China,
Taiwan, other Asian countries and Africa. Sasol has a 40% share in
this plant with Petronas 40% and DSM from Holland 20%.
	   The two plants will increase Sasol's production of polyethylene by
50%. Sasol will use its 10% interest in Wesco, a distributor of
polymer products in China and Taiwan, to access Asian markets for its
Malaysian output.

A lady walks into a shop that sells VERY expensive Persian rugs. She browses
around, then spots the perfect rug and walks over to inspect it.  As she
bends to feel the texture of the rug, she farts loudly. Very embarrassed,
she looks around nervously to see if anyone has noticed her little accident
and hopes a sales person doesn't pop up right now. As she turns back, there,
standing next to her is a salesman. "Good day, madam. How may we help you
today?" Very uncomfortably she asks, "Sir, what is the price of this lovely
rug?" He answers, "Madam, if you farted just touching it, you are very
likely going to shit when you hear the price."

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Energy Producers Continue Expansion
Plans Despite Cautious Market in 2002, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 17, 2002--The following is an
advisory by IndustrialInfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc;
Houston). It seems as though it was just yesterday that the California
energy crisis was reaching catastrophic proportions and Governor Davis
(CA) had all but deemed Houston the evil empire of the universe. All
eyes were on the states with deregulation looming on the horizon and
wondering if the next deregulated state would follow in the steps of
California. State governors and a newly elected Bush Administration
were scrambling for answers to prevent a regional crisis from becoming
a national nightmare. Prior to that Industrial Information Resources
had identified over 300,000 megawatts of new generation either under
construction or in various stages of planning and development. The
solution then was to build more power plants and add new capacity.
Also in response to the shortfall of energy production, the National
Energy Policy estimated the need for 1,300 new power plants to meet
future demand. Developers responded in kind, taking an aggressive
approach to meet our new electrical needs by developing and building
new power plants at alarming rates.
	   Wow! What a difference a year makes. Due to new capacity, milder
seasons and a shaky economy, lower demand and prices are causing some
to question the validity of the national energy crisis. No less than
seven states have delayed deregulation placing in question the future
developments of some new plants. Our economy, already in recession
took a nose-dive after the tragic events of Sept. 11, 2001, further
reducing demand primarily from industrial and commercial customers. To
close out the year we witnessed the demise of the Enron Corporation,
which could have far-reaching effects in the industry. As a result
many developers are heading into 2002 with a more cautious approach to
constructing new power plants.
	   On Wednesday one of the most aggressive developers in the
industry, Calpine Corporation (NYSE:CPN) (San Jose, Calif.) outlined
their revised future development program in a conference call hosted
by Pete Cartwright (chairman, CEO & president), Robert Kelly
(president of Calpine Finance), Charles Clark (senior VP & corporate
controller) and other members of Calpine's management team. Calpine
announced plans for completion of twenty-seven projects representing
15,200MW currently under construction. "Upon completion of
construction of this program, Calpine will have a portfolio of
26,300MW of the most efficient power plants in the United States by
the end of 2003," stated Cartwright. Plans are to proceed with
thirty-four projects in advanced development accounting for 15,100MW
of capacity. Development of these projects will be completed to a
point where they are ready to begin construction and then will be
placed in "hot standby" according to Mr. Cartwright. "We have ordered
all these projects be put on hold and no capital spending will take
place until we have had opportunities to do a thorough review of each
project." Calpine had planned to spend about $2 Billion on advanced
projects in 2002. "We intend to keep going with these projects when
conditions are right. We do not intend to have any significant
cancellations." Plans are to continue with approximately 30,000MW in
early development originally scheduled to be completed by 2006. In
contrast, Cartwright says a number of his competitors are cancelling
and selling off their projects. In his address, Mr. Cartwright also
commented on the status of power markets, availability of capital and
earnings. "Our goal, as it's always been, is to grow Calpine to become
the largest and most profitable power generator in North America."
	   Calpine is certainly not the only power plant developer to
announce revised programs for the coming year. Companies such as NRG
Energy, Dynegy and El Paso Merchant Energy have also announced a
review of their strategies. Research conducted by Industrial
Information Resources has identified over 50,000MW of cancelled
projects since June of 2001, including projects by PPL and Mirant.
"While this is a major contrast from the beginning of 2001, all we
need is a speedy economic recovery, a harsh winter and a scorching
summer and it could be deja vu all over again," according to Britt
Burt manager of power market research for Industrial Information
Resources.

The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 05:00 and 17:00 in the
January 24, 2002 Real-Time Market.

In addition, the NYISO is reserving hours beginning 11:00, 13:00 and 15:00
in the Hour-Ahead locational reserve market.

Prices in the January 25, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Quebec Emerges As Key Location for New
Pharmaceutical and Biotech Plants, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors & Health/Medical Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 30, 2002--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc.; Houston,
Texas). The Canadian province of Quebec is successfully courting new
capital investment from pharmaceutical and biotech companies
worldwide. In the past year, over $300 million in new capital projects
were announced. Quebec is not only seeking established international
companies; they are also "hatching" them on a regular basis from their
strong Biotech City, located in Laval, Quebec. Biotech City is already
home to about 30 biotechnology, biopharmaceutical and information
technology companies and research centers. INRS-Institut Armand
Frappier, the host of Biotech City, is spending over $100 million to
add new R&D laboratory space and upgrade existing facilities.
	   Offering a host of attractions, including lucrative government
incentives and a strong intellectual property base at the
universities, Quebec is emerging as a major player in both research
and development and the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and biotech
products. Gone are the hints of outsiders being shunned for not being
French. Clever marketing efforts now promote that deep European flavor
coupled with a desirable North American location. Those efforts are
paying off.
	   The roster of companies investing in new or expanded facilities is
growing every year. Industrial Information Resources (IIR) is tracking
these companies. Merck Frosst Canada & Company (Kirkland, Quebec) is
in the midst of a $250 million expansion and modernization program at
their Kirkland, Quebec site. Pharmascience Incorporated (Montreal,
Quebec) recently completed a $50 million expansion at their Montreal
facility. Quebec is also under serious consideration by two
international pharmaceutical companies for new plant investment at a
combined cost of almost $1 billion.
	   IIR tracks project spending trends in the Pharmaceutical-Biotech
industry and has recently released the 2002 US Pharmaceutical-Biotech
Industry Forecast
(http://www.industrialinfo.com/2002pharmforecast.htm)
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
and industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming
construction activities in the Pharmaceutical-Biotech markets as well

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Harley-Davidson Roars into the New
Millennium, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors & Automotive Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 23, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, Texas). You can hear them approaching from hundreds of yards
away. That guttural, rumbling, roar can only denote one thing, a
Harley is near. Harley-Davidson Motor Company (Milwaukee, Wi.)
(NYSE:HDI) has been an institution in the motorcycle industry since
1903 when William S. Harley and Arthur Davidson first painted their
names on the gas tank of the first Harley-Davidson (H-D) Motorcycle.
Originally designed to be a racing bike, the H-D bike won its first
race in 1905 and never looked back.
	   As the most popular motorcycle in America, H-D is constantly
growing in an effort to keep pace with ever-increasing demand, and to
keep ahead of the research curve on new product development. The new
millennium appears to bode well for H-D as they have announced plans
to spend approximately $250 million on capital projects in 2001 alone.
This includes grassroot plants in both Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and
will position H-D to maintain its lead in the U.S. motorcycle
industry. In addition to planning brand new facilities, H-D is also
expanding and upgrading their existing plants and research centers. In
Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, H-D is planning a 75,000 square foot (sqft)
office building addition and a 65,000 sqft plant expansion.
	   These expansions will enable H-D to maintain 800 jobs and create
393 new positions, something the Governor of the state is fully
behind. "The company is expanding and upgrading equipment at two of
its Wisconsin facilities," says Wisconsin Governor Scott McCallum.
"The quality of its products has helped raise Wisconsin's viability
around the world." H-D shipped 200,000 motorcycles for the first time
in company history last year. H-D's internal company goals had
initially called for reaching that sales milestone by 2003, the year
they celebrate their first century of business.
	   Harley-Davidson, Incorporated is the largest U.S.-based motorcycle
manufacturer, and produces heavyweight motorcycles and offers a
complete line of motorcycle parts, accessories, apparel, and general
merchandise.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Energy Producers Continue Expansion
Plans Despite Cautious Market in 2002, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 17, 2002--The following is an
advisory by IndustrialInfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc;
Houston). It seems as though it was just yesterday that the California
energy crisis was reaching catastrophic proportions and Governor Davis
(CA) had all but deemed Houston the evil empire of the universe. All
eyes were on the states with deregulation looming on the horizon and
wondering if the next deregulated state would follow in the steps of
California. State governors and a newly elected Bush Administration
were scrambling for answers to prevent a regional crisis from becoming
a national nightmare. Prior to that Industrial Information Resources
had identified over 300,000 megawatts of new generation either under
construction or in various stages of planning and development. The
solution then was to build more power plants and add new capacity.
Also in response to the shortfall of energy production, the National
Energy Policy estimated the need for 1,300 new power plants to meet
future demand. Developers responded in kind, taking an aggressive
approach to meet our new electrical needs by developing and building
new power plants at alarming rates.
	   Wow! What a difference a year makes. Due to new capacity, milder
seasons and a shaky economy, lower demand and prices are causing some
to question the validity of the national energy crisis. No less than
seven states have delayed deregulation placing in question the future
developments of some new plants. Our economy, already in recession
took a nose-dive after the tragic events of Sept. 11, 2001, further
reducing demand primarily from industrial and commercial customers. To
close out the year we witnessed the demise of the Enron Corporation,
which could have far-reaching effects in the industry. As a result
many developers are heading into 2002 with a more cautious approach to
constructing new power plants.
	   On Wednesday one of the most aggressive developers in the
industry, Calpine Corporation (NYSE:CPN) (San Jose, Calif.) outlined
their revised future development program in a conference call hosted
by Pete Cartwright (chairman, CEO & president), Robert Kelly
(president of Calpine Finance), Charles Clark (senior VP & corporate
controller) and other members of Calpine's management team. Calpine
announced plans for completion of twenty-seven projects representing
15,200MW currently under construction. "Upon completion of
construction of this program, Calpine will have a portfolio of
26,300MW of the most efficient power plants in the United States by
the end of 2003," stated Cartwright. Plans are to proceed with
thirty-four projects in advanced development accounting for 15,100MW
of capacity. Development of these projects will be completed to a
point where they are ready to begin construction and then will be
placed in "hot standby" according to Mr. Cartwright. "We have ordered
all these projects be put on hold and no capital spending will take
place until we have had opportunities to do a thorough review of each
project." Calpine had planned to spend about $2 Billion on advanced
projects in 2002. "We intend to keep going with these projects when
conditions are right. We do not intend to have any significant
cancellations." Plans are to continue with approximately 30,000MW in
early development originally scheduled to be completed by 2006. In
contrast, Cartwright says a number of his competitors are cancelling
and selling off their projects. In his address, Mr. Cartwright also
commented on the status of power markets, availability of capital and
earnings. "Our goal, as it's always been, is to grow Calpine to become
the largest and most profitable power generator in North America."
	   Calpine is certainly not the only power plant developer to
announce revised programs for the coming year. Companies such as NRG
Energy, Dynegy and El Paso Merchant Energy have also announced a
review of their strategies. Research conducted by Industrial
Information Resources has identified over 50,000MW of cancelled
projects since June of 2001, including projects by PPL and Mirant.
"While this is a major contrast from the beginning of 2001, all we
need is a speedy economic recovery, a harsh winter and a scorching
summer and it could be deja vu all over again," according to Britt
Burt manager of power market research for Industrial Information
Resources.

Hello Everyone,

	We had a few upsets this week, with some games missed by quite a few people. No one correctly picked Georgia
defeating #7 Tennessee. Oklahoma/TX game was mixed, many people missed Ohio St. beating Northwestern and the only non-top 25 game was mixed, with many people taking Southern Miss, as Memphis won 22-17. In the pros, many people picked Atlanta over the Bears incorrectly, San Diego over Cleveland was missed by most people, Arizona upsetting the Eagles was not good for just about everyone, Seattle beating Jacksonville was not picked by most people and Tampa Bay defeating Green Bay was also missed by most. Through all that, Joe Step did only get 5 incorrect picks and has won this weeks pool already. I came close with 6 wrong, but we both have St. Louis tonight. We had 33 entries this week, the most we've ever had, even back to last season, good job!! Therefore Joe won $66. Below is each person with the number of games they missed this week.

Iris,

I agree with Rob that the course is a little light relative to the time spent.  The course material is on the web and I suggest going through this.  I would also include Paul Thomas in your resource list and recommend spending some time with Paul and the Northeast Physical group.  They live and breath this market daily.

Tom.

Hi,

	I came across a workshop which discusses all the aspects of NYISO' s operation - see email below.  

	Some of the transmission guys suggested that Enron should be represented at this conference.

	However, Rob Stalford says that you guys are able to tell us everything we need to know about the new NYISO regulatory environment. 

Thanks,
Iris

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) US Chemical Companies Spending Millions
To Produce Their Own Electricity, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 15, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Inc.; Houston, Texas). The Dow Chemical Company, BP and Occidental
Chemical Company all have something new in common. These companies,
along with a growing list of their peers, are increasingly turning to
combined heat and power (CHP) generation, more commonly known as
cogeneration, as a solution for their electricity and process steam
needs. The co-production of electricity and steam are not new ideas,
but their popularity in the U.S. is growing. Recent estimates have
chemical companies responsible for nearly 1/3 or 17,000 mega-watts
(MW) of all electricity generated through cogeneration in the US.
	   Aided by legislation passed in 1978 allowing the sale of excess
electricity to local grids and more recent deregulation, projects of
all sizes are being planned and built across the country. Many factors
have contributed to make cogeneration more attractive to chemical
companies and chief among them are favorable economics and
environmental efficiency. Even the smaller chemical companies are
building cogeneration units, thanks to recent technological
breakthroughs.
	   Dow Chemical and American Electric Power have teamed up to build a
$325 million 900MW cogeneration at Dow's site in Plaquemine,
Louisiana, scheduled to start construction in the fourth quarter of
2001 and be completed in 2003. BP and Cinergy Solutions broke ground
late last month on a 570MW plant for BP's Texas City, Texas refinery
and chemical complex. The $275 million plant is expected to come
online in 2004. Occidental Chemical Corporation is reviewing plans for
an 80MW plant for one of its Gulf Coast sites with approval of for the
$40 million project expected in June of 2002.
	   "Traditional power producers were less than thrilled with the
increasing trend towards cogeneration, as they were not only losing
part of their customer base, but were also seeing those customers
emerge as rivals on the open market," according to Annette Kreuger,
Chemical Industry Specialist with Industrialinfo.com. "To offset the
losses, those same traditional energy producers are now bending over
backwards to put together attractive design and construction packages
for the chemical companies. In some cases, they are entering into
partnerships with the companies to share costs and profits. In these
days of deregulation, there are a host of ways to set up these new
cogen units, but the bottom line is that chemical producers want more
control of how their energy dollars are spent."
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
and industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming
construction activities in the Chemical Processing (CPI) markets as
well as other industrial sectors send inquiries to

Dear Market Participants:

Methodology used in developing the NYISO Virtual Bidding Credit
Requirements:

Day Ahead Market Hourly Zonal LBMP and Real Time Market Integrated Hourly
Zonal LBMP values were used as the data source for developing the NYISO
Virtual Bidding Credit Requirements.  These values are available on the
NYISO web site.  The time period of June 1, 2001 through August 31, 2001
was used.  Peak hours are defined here as the hours of 6am (06:00) through
and including 10pm (22:00).  The absolute value of the difference of the
DAM and R/T price was calculated for each peak hour.  The 97th percentile
of these series of prices was calculated for each zone.  The maximum of
these zonal 97th percentiles was calculated to be $159.33.  The data
manipulation and calculation was performed in MS Excel. The attached
spreadsheet contains the data used in the June 2001 to August 2001
calculations.

                    PM                   Subject:     ICAP/UCAP New procedure for Certification and updated form





Due to the large number of interpretations regarding the guidelines for
completing and
 submitting the UCAP Certification form, the following is designed to
reduce confusion
 and to bring uniformity to the certification process.

1.   All participants in the UCAP market who have had any purchase or
  sale activity must submit a certification.

2.   All transactions (including ISO auctions) must be recorded on the
  certification form.
   The ISO will validate your reported auction transactions.

3.   If you report activity in any month, you must continue reporting until
  the end
   of the (Winter or Summer) capability period.

4.   Bilaterals transacted after the certification date for the reportable
  month will not be
   recognized by the ISO.

5.   The ISO is are now changing the methodology for the recording of
  sales.

  The following procedure must be followed by a Supplier who physically
  owns capacity
   and does not serve a load.

a.   The Supplier will report all UCAP sold by PTID as a purchase, with
positive
      values, to themselves.  Do not report more UCAP than was sold.
b.   The Supplier will report all UCAP sold to OTHERS, without denoting
PTIDs as
      negative values.

  The following procedure must be followed by a Supplier who physically
  owns capacity and
  does serve a load, or an LSE who self-supplies from its own resources
  (i.e., SCR).

a.   The Supplier will report all UCAP sold by PTID as a purchase, with
positive values,
     to themselves.  Do not report more UCAP than was sold to OTHERS, and
     claimed for self-supply.
b.   The Supplier will report all UCAP sold to OTHERS, without denoting
PTIDs as
     negative values.
c.   The Supplier will not report the sale of UCAP to itself, these sales
have been included
     in step a. above.

6.   The following procedure must be followed by Load Serving Entities.
  a. the LSE will not identify PTID's.
  b. the LSE will report purchases as positive values.
  c. the LSE will report sales as negative values.

Attached are three sample certifications and one blank certification.

Sample 1

A Supplier with 200 MW of UCAP sold 100 MWs to the NYISO in the December
   monthly auction.  This Supplier has not sold 100 MW of the 200 available

Sample 2

A Supplier/LSE with 300 MW of UCAP available to sell, sold 50 MW to a new
LSE, kept 150 for its
 own needs and purchased 50 from an a new supplier to meet its 200MW UCAP
requirement.
This Supplier/LSE has not sold 100 MW of the 300 available

Sample 3

A LSE with a 75 MW requirement purchases all its UCAP from two sources.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) New Aluminum Bottle Products May Lead to
Increased Aluminum Usage in the Beverage Packaging Industry, in an
Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 15, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, Texas). About a year and a half ago, Daiwa Can Company,
Japan's largest aluminum can producer, began producing aluminum
bottles for beer and tea companies. The novelty has caught on in Japan
where the company produced approximately 480 million aluminum bottles
in 2001. Along with two other manufacturers of aluminum bottles,
capacity is expected to double over the next 2-3 years. All three
manufacturers of aluminum bottles in Japan are contemplating line

	   The aluminum bottle can has all the attributes of the aluminum
beverage can, it is lightweight and recyclable, but is shaped like a
bottle. It comes with a resealable aluminum screw on cap, which is
also recyclable. Aluminum bottles are expected to take market share
back from PET (Plastic) bottles, which have grown in popularity lately
and have replaced both glass & metal in some markets. It's only a
matter of time before this product catches on in the U.S. and other
international markets.

Govenrment Names

Almost 150 yrs ago, President Lincoln found it necessary to hire a private
investigator - Mr. Alan Pinkerton. The function that Pinkerton established
actually was the beginning of the Secret Service.
Since that time federal police authority has grown to a large number of
three-letter agencies - FBI, CIA, INS, IRS, DEA. Now comes a proposal for
another agency: The "Airport Security Service."  Can't you see it now, the
new service in their black outfits  with their initials in large white
letters across their backs?

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Canada's Iogen Produces Ethanol From
Wheat Straw, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 17, 2002--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Incorporated;
Houston). Iogen Corporation (Ottawa, Ontario) a privately held
company, is preparing final touches on a pilot scale ethanol plant to
demonstrate how ethanol can be produced from cellulose plant fibers.
	   Iogen is on target to begin producing 3,100 gallons per day of
fuel grade ethanol by the spring of 2002, utilizing approximately 40
tons per day of wheat straw feedstock. The process involves making
sugar from cellulose plant fiber. The sugars are fermented and
distilled into ethanol. Formerly, Ethanol-from-cellulose was
impractical and costly to manufacture until Iogen had success in
developing and manufacturing industrial enzymes to make ethanol fuel
out of agricultural residues.
	   The facility, located in Ottawa, Ontario Canada, has been in the
works since October of 1997. With capital assistance from Petro-Canada
(Calgary, Alberta), Iogen has made an investment of $30 million
(Canadian) to validate the usage of ethanol-from-cellulose technology.
Plans are already underway to find a site to construct a commercial
scale facility to produce roughly 50 million gallons per year of
ethanol.
	   Jay Brunson, synthetic fuels manager for Industrial Information
Resources said, "Iogen has been investigating possible sites for the
$60 plus million commercial scale plant in the United States, Canada
and the United Kingdom. We could see the first use of this type of
technology in a large scale commercial plant as early as 2004."
	   Industrial Information Resources has developed an exclusive
real-time database for the ethanol industry. The Ethanol Production
Package (http://www.industrialinfo.com/esemdethanolpp.htm) provides a
comprehensive outline of all current development activities in the
emerging ethanol market place. This database covers 60 ethanol plants
currently in operation and 62 plants under development.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including alerts on industry and business trends and
project activity. For more information on upcoming construction
activities in the synthetic fuels industry as well as other industrial
sectors send inquiries to synfuelsgroup@industrialinfo.com or visit us

=09 If you made a New Year's resolution, you've got company -- with history=
, that is! Making New Year's resolutions has been a tradition since the ear=
ly Babylonians. While their most popular resolution was to return borrowed =
farm equipment, your resolution probably has something to do with getting b=
etter organized and prepared for the semester or to become a better student=
 with higher grades.   With  Questia , this is one resolution you'll be abl=
e to keep. Questia is the essential tool for any college student; and at $1=
9.95 per month , it's a great value. Compare Questia to the investment you =
already have in your education -- room and board, tuition, college prep cou=
rses, etc. Questia is a much smaller investment, less than the cost of a te=
xtbook, and will help you to achieve success at school.  =09
 The World's Largest Online Library of Books with content not found anywher=
e else on the Internet  Your subscription to Questia grows in value because=
 we're always adding books. We now have more than 70,000 books  and journal=
 articles in our collection; and during 2002, we'll be adding even more. He=
re are a few of our latest additions:   Trust on Trial:  How the Microsoft =
Case is Reframing the Rules of Competition          by Richard B. McKenzie =
 DNA and Destiny: Nature and Nurture in Human Behavior        by R. Grant S=

harge and Changing the World We Know        by Andrew L. Shapiro  Lies! Lie=
s!! Lies!!!:  The Psychology of Deceit        by Charles V. Ford  Take our =
free test drive  and you'll see exactly what we mean.     =09    Ensure suc=
cess  One way to keep your New Year's resolution of becoming a better stude=
nt is to start thinking about all the papers and assignments you'll be rese=
arching and writing this semester -- essays, position papers and research p=
apers. When you become a Questia subscriber , in addition to our exclusive =
library, you'll have access to great writing and organizational tools that =
you can use all semester long.  With Questia, you'll do better research, be=
 better organized, even learn how to write better papers and, most importan=
tly, you'll become a better student.    Questia fun fact Did you know that =
2002 is a palindrome? What's a palindrome? We looked it up in our reference=

Every "Hormone Hostage" knows that there are days in the month when all a
man has to do is open his mouth and he takes his life in his hands.
This is a handy guide that should be as common as a driver's License in
the wallet of every husband, boyfriend or significant other.

* DANGEROUS: What's for dinner?
* SAFER: Can I help you with dinner?
* SAFEST: Where would you like to go for dinner?

* DANGEROUS: Are you wearing THAT?
* SAFER: Gee, you look good in brown.
* SAFEST: Wow! Look at you!

* DANGEROUS: What are you so worked up about?
* SAFER: Could we be overreacting?
* SAFEST: Here's fifty dollars.

* DANGEROUS: Should you be eating that?
* SAFER: You know, there are a lot of apples left.
* SAFEST: Can I get you a glass of wine with that?

* DANGEROUS: What did you DO all day?
* SAFER: I hope you didn't overdo it today.
* SAFEST: I've always loved you in that robe.

Q: How many women with PMS does it take to change a light bulb?

A: One. Only ONE!! And do you know WHY? Because no one else in this
house knows HOW to change a light bulb! They don't even know that the
bulb is BURNED OUT! They would sit in the dark for THREE DAYS before they
figured it out. And, once they figured it out, they wouldn't be able to
find the light bulbs despite the fact that they've been in the SAME CUPBOARD

for the past 17 YEARS! But if they did, by some miracle, actually find them
2 DAYS LATER, the chair they dragged to stand on to change the STUPID
light bulb would STILL BE IN THE SAME SPOT!! AND UNDERNEATH IT WOULD BE THE
WRAPPER THE STUPID @*!#$% LIGHT BULBS CAME IN! WHY? BECAUSE NO-ONE EVER
CARRIES OUT THE GARBAGE!! IT'S A WONDER WE HAVEN'T ALL SUFFOCATED FROM THE
PILES OF GARBAGE THAT ARE 12' DEEP THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE HOUSE. THE HOUSE!!
- IT WOULD TAKE AN ARMY TO CLEAN THIS #@*$!#@*$!#@!... HOUSE!

I'm sorry...what did you ask me?

Attached FYI is a memo prepared by IPPNY summarizing a NY Court of Appeals =
(NY's highest court) decision issued last week that could impact environmen=
tal reviews of projects that are smaller than 80 MW and thus not subject to=
 the State's siting law. As noted by IPPNY, the impact of this court ruling=
 could be to delay the environmental review and thus the permitting time fo=
r these smaller plants.  In other generation-related developments, the NYS =
Siting Board last week approved the Astoria Energy project. This is a 1,000=
 MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle facility to be loacted in Astoria, Que=
ens, New York City. The plant is estimated to go in service the 3rd quarter=
 of 2004. This brings to over 1600 MW the amount of new in-city generation =
recently approved by the State Siting Board, on top of the 400 Mw\W added t=
his past summer by the NY Power Authority.

Member Alert #48-2001
November 26, 2001

Court of Appeals issues Potential Setback to SEQRA Generators In NYPA Turbi=
ne Ruling

On November 20, 2001, the New York State Court of Appeals denied a motion b=
y the New York Power Authority ("NYPA") for leave to appeal a Appellate Div=
ision decision, Uprose v. Power Authority of State of New York, requiring t=
he preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement ("EIS") for its install=
ation of 10 GE LM6000 turbines at several sites in New York City.  (IPPNY's=
 brief supporting NYPA's motion was accepted by the Court.)  The impact of =
the ruling may be to delay the environmental review for projects evaluated =
under the State Environmental Quality Review Act ("SEQRA").

The Court of Appeals, the State's highest court, did not affirm the Appella=
te Division's decision, it merely declined to consider the appeal, which wa=
s discretionary.  The decision is binding only in the courts of the 2nd jud=
icial department, which includes Long Island and Westchester, although cour=
ts in other areas of the state may rely on the case for guidance.

Prior to the lawsuit, NYPA issued a negative declaration of potential signi=
ficant impact with regard to the turbine projects, a SEQRA prerequisite to =
proceeding without preparing an EIS.  The Appellate Division decision requi=
red that NYPA prepare an EIS by January 31, 2002 because NYPA's analysis of=
 particulate matter 2.5 ("PM2.5"), which relied on an evaluation of PM10 as=
 a proxy, was insufficiently detailed to support a negative declaration.=20

The potential impact for new generation projects is that applicants proposi=
ng power plants under 80 MW, which are subject to SEQRA, may be required to=
 prepare an EIS.  A State agency may still be able to issue a negative decl=
aration, and thus avoid the requirement to prepare an EIS, if an applicant =
demonstrates in its Environmental Assessment Form ("EAF") that there is no =
potential for adverse environmental impacts from PM2.5.  However, as a resu=
lt of the Uprose decision, the applicant may not be able to make this demon=
stration by relying on a PM10 proxy analysis.  If the demonstration cannot =
be made that PM2.5 will not have a potential adverse environmental impact, =
the agency must make a positive declaration, requiring the preparation of a=
n EIS and associated public notice and participation.  Potentially signific=
ant delay could result from this process.

The Appellate Division decision should have little impact on Article X appl=
ications.  The Article X process supplants the SEQRA process.  Essentially,=
 the Article X process requires the preparation of an EIS equivalent, where=
in PM2.5 is analyzed.  At least one case, Consolidated Edison's East River =
Repowering Project, has addressed the PM2.5 issue.  In that case, the Depar=
tment of Environmental Conservation ("DEC"), Department of Health, and the =
Department of Public Service agreed that the only applicable legal standard=
 for PM2.5 is the PM10 proxy standard.  The Board on Electric Generation Si=
ting and the Environment ruled that PM2.5 was not an issue in the case beca=
use it is within the purview of the companion DEC air permit proceeding.  A=
 ruling distinguishing the Uprose case was made by the Commissioner of DEC.=
  Although the court found that the proxy analysis conducted by NYPA was no=
t sufficiently detailed in the EAF to support a negative declaration under =
SEQRA in the Uprose case, the DEC Commissioner found in the East River case=
 that the PM10 analysis will support the determination as to whether or not=
 the proposed project complies with the PM2.5 standard.

In an unrelated development, the FERC last week issued two orders addressin=
g issues related to market mitigation.  In its Order Establishing Refund Ef=
fective Date And Proposing To Revise Market-Based Rate Tariffs And Authoriz=
ations ("Market Rates Order"), FERC instituted a proceeding to investigate =
the justness and reasonableness of the terms and conditions of market-based=
 rate tariffs and authorizations of wholesale generators.  FERC noted that =
it intends to revise all existing market-based rate tariffs and authorizati=
ons by adding the following language (which will be included in all new aut=
horizations, as well):

"As a condition of obtaining and retaining market-based rate authority, the=
 seller is prohibited from engaging in anticompetitive behavior or the exer=
cise of market power. The seller's market-based rate authority is subject t=
o refunds or other remedies as may be appropriate to address any anticompet=
itive behavior or exercise of market power."

FERC indicated that the refund effective date will be 60 days from notice o=
f the Market Rates Order in the Federal Register.

In a second order, FERC announced that it will implement an industry-wide s=
tandard market mitigation measure that will address conditions of market sh=
ortage in which market power could be abused.  The surplus margin assessmen=
t ("SMA") tool will be employed by FERC to determine what entities possess =
market power.  The SMA will replace the FERC's existing "Hub-and-Spoke" met=
hodology for determining whether an entity possesses market power.   Entiti=
es that fail the screen are required to sell uncommitted capacity into the =
spot market pursuant to a form of cost-of-service rates.  The SMA order exp=
ressly does not apply in New York, because FERC noted that it will not appl=
y this new mitigation procedure in markets (including NY) where market miti=
gation plans have been approved by FERC.

Copies of the orders are available upon request.  If you have any questions=
, please don't hesitate to contact IPPNY.

Mesquite Power Plant in Arizona, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 23, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc;
Houston). Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE)
(San Diego), will soon complete the underground piping and foundation
for a 1,250MW power plant near Arlington, Ariz. Located on a 400-acre
site, the Mesquite generating station is being built to serve the
southwest power market, including utilities and other whole energy
purchasers.
	   At an estimated $690 million project cost, the 1,250MW plant is
the second largest merchant power plant under construction in the
state, second only to the 2,300MW Gila River project. The plant will
have a natural gas fired combined-cycle configuration consisting of
two 625MW power blocks, each having two GE model PG7241FA combustion
turbine generators and a single GE steam turbine generator. The first
block will come online mid year 2003, with the second block scheduled
to come online in the beginning of 2004.
	   BVZ Power Partners, a combination of Black & Veatch, Overland
Contracting, and Zachry Construction Corporation, is providing
engineering and construction services for the project.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Quebec Emerges As Key Location for New
Pharmaceutical and Biotech Plants, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors & Health/Medical Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 30, 2002--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc.; Houston,
Texas). The Canadian province of Quebec is successfully courting new
capital investment from pharmaceutical and biotech companies
worldwide. In the past year, over $300 million in new capital projects
were announced. Quebec is not only seeking established international
companies; they are also "hatching" them on a regular basis from their
strong Biotech City, located in Laval, Quebec. Biotech City is already
home to about 30 biotechnology, biopharmaceutical and information
technology companies and research centers. INRS-Institut Armand
Frappier, the host of Biotech City, is spending over $100 million to
add new R&D laboratory space and upgrade existing facilities.
	   Offering a host of attractions, including lucrative government
incentives and a strong intellectual property base at the
universities, Quebec is emerging as a major player in both research
and development and the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and biotech
products. Gone are the hints of outsiders being shunned for not being
French. Clever marketing efforts now promote that deep European flavor
coupled with a desirable North American location. Those efforts are
paying off.
	   The roster of companies investing in new or expanded facilities is
growing every year. Industrial Information Resources (IIR) is tracking
these companies. Merck Frosst Canada & Company (Kirkland, Quebec) is
in the midst of a $250 million expansion and modernization program at
their Kirkland, Quebec site. Pharmascience Incorporated (Montreal,
Quebec) recently completed a $50 million expansion at their Montreal
facility. Quebec is also under serious consideration by two
international pharmaceutical companies for new plant investment at a
combined cost of almost $1 billion.
	   IIR tracks project spending trends in the Pharmaceutical-Biotech
industry and has recently released the 2002 US Pharmaceutical-Biotech
Industry Forecast
(http://www.industrialinfo.com/2002pharmforecast.htm)
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
and industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming
construction activities in the Pharmaceutical-Biotech markets as well
as other industrial sectors send inquiries to
pharmabiotech@industrialinfo.com or visit us at

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Russia Versus the Rest in Guinean
Bauxite Scrap, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 15, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, Texas). The Dian-Dian bauxite concession in the West African
country of Guinea is the bone of contention between Russian Aluminium
(Rusal) and a consortium, CBG (Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee),
which has among its members Pechiney, Comalco, Alcoa, VAW and Alcan.
The Russians already have a concession at Kindia but set the cost of
bauxite production at Dian-Dian at roughly 50% of their Kindia deal.
They claim that a deal was struck when the Guinean president visited
Moscow in July, which pre-empted the CBG group who in turn claim to
have first right of refusal with the government in the capital Conakry
and are challenging Rusal's claim.
	   Dian-Dian is reported by Rusal to hold between 400 million and one
billion tons of bauxite. Local Guineans are split between increasing
support for the Russians to assist in developing the national alumina
and mining industry and those who doubt whether the Russians will
eventually build a planned alumina refinery in Guinea. The latter
faction sees CBG benefits in broad industry involvement and the
stability of its members.

Dear Member,

It has been more than a month since the tragic events of
September 11.  And I want to express my personal
appreciation to the many thousands of readers from around
the world who have sent in words of sympathy to the people
of this country and in particular of New York City.  The
New York Times on the Web has kept open the area reserved
for these messages, and you are free to read them on our
site.

http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/19/national/ATTFORUM.html?rd=hcmcp?p=041EBP041E8z44Ib1012000mxZkHxZo$

The unfolding developments on the military and public
health areas are covered in great depth by the Times'
staff of reporters and editors. To make it easier to catch
up on the past six weeks of coverage, we have created a
special section on the Web called "A Nation Challenged."
This includes a day-by-day rundown of events as well as an
archive of past coverage.

http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/dayofterror/index.html?rd=hcmcp?p=041EAk041E8z44Ib1012000mxZkHxZo$

With so many correspondents involved in coverage of this
crisis, we felt it might illuminate some of the background
to these stories to have conversations with many of them.
You can listen to conversations with such veteran
correspondents as R.W. Apple, John F. Burns, David Sanger,
Judith Miller, and many others.

http://www.nytimes.com/library/world/101801begwer-audio.html?rd=hcmcp?p=041E9O041E8z44Ib1012000mxZkHxZo$

In a further effort to provide some unusual background to
the situation, Vincent Laforet, a New York Times staff
photographer, gives a first person account of being among
the refugees in Pakistan in "Photographer's Journal," a personal
multimedia essay.   His photos explore refugees piecing
together a Koran, spending time in an opium den and living
in a Pakistani school. Vincent accompanies the essay with
an audio description.

http://www.nytimes.com/photojournal?rd=hcmcp?p=041E8x041E8z44Ib1012000mxZkHxZo$

I have to confess to being a fervent New York Yankees fan,
going back to my childhood as a boy in the Bronx. Many New
Yorkers got a tremendous lift by the Yankees' comeback
against a very strong Oakland Athletics team. By the time
you read this you may know whether the Yankees won or lost
against the Seattle Mariners in the championship series
leading up to the World Series.

Why didn't we think of this????????
When you get ads in your phone or utility bill, include them with the payment.
Let them throw it away.
When you get those pre-approved letters in the mail for everything from
credit cards to 2nd mortgages and junk like that, most of them come
with postage paid return envelopes, right?
Well, why not get rid of some of your other junk mail and put it in with
these cool little envelopes!
Send an ad for your local cleaners to American Express, Or a
pizza coupon to Citibank.
If you didn't get anything else that day, then just send them their application
back!
If you want to remain anonymous, just make sure your name isn't on anything you
send them.
You can send it back empty just to keep them guessing!
Eventually, the banks and credit card companies will begin getting all their
junk back in the mail.
Let's let them know what it's like to get junk mail, and best of all THEY'RE
paying for it! TWICE!
Let's help keep our postal service busy since they say e-mail is cutting into
their business,
and that's why they need to increase postage again!

They'll get the message if we keep passing this on.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Russians and De Beers Cutting a Diamond
Supply Deal, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 25, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Inc., Houston, Texas). Looking to assure themselves of a minimum of
$500 million worth of rough Russian diamonds per annum, De Beers
(Johannesburg, South Africa) is looking to sign a long term agreement
on diamond marketing in December when the current agreement expires.
The Russians favor a deal between De Beers and the Russian diamond
company Alrosa thus being able to protect and control the adequate
supply of rough diamonds to the home industry and enable it to work
profitably.
	   Reports say that an agreement has been drafted and details are
being ironed out between the Russians and the South Africans. Over the
last two years, De Beers purchased around $1 billion of rough stones
in Moscow and they need the supply to maintain the variety they offer
clients. In the specialized world of diamond supply and demand
negotiations, De Beers does not want the Russian cutters to have sole
first rights over the best stones coming from the mine.
	   De Beers, the world's leading diamond producer was acquired
earlier this year by DB Investments and is currently delisted from the
JSE and LSE.

market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants:

The NYISO Back-Up Dispatch System is scheduled to be tested on Tuesday,
October 2, 2001.  The test will begin at about 10:30 a.m. and last for
approximately one hour.

Security Constrained Dispatch (SCD) will be stopped, but the mainframe
computer will continue to operate, allowing the NYISO to monitor security.
If a situation occurs, the Shift Supervisor will be able to re-start SCD
and take appropriate action.  The Market Information System (MIS) and

RTO Week

 <?xml:namespace prefix =3D o ns =3D "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:offi=
ce" />

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

=20

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices=20

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =
Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=
istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=
ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=
ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=
mpany.

=20


General Observations


=20

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left la=
te in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t=
he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of=
 all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; =
much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme=
d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo=
rward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover for=
ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha=
t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t=
o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was d=
iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the=
 reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=
ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=
anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

=20


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was "How many RTOs?  What is their scope?"  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, "What will be standard market design?"  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, "Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?" and, "How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should "Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further."  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e "RTO Design and RTO Implementation" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule ("covered" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both "covered" and "uncovered" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., "do congestion management") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., "LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, "My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true."  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, "Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?"  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the "new" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed "successes," such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these "successes" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Dear Power Outage Database Customer,

Attached you will find an excel document. The outages contained within

Guys:

Bob ask if I could help coordinate a meeting with you to gather valuable input.  
Would Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon around 4:00 be an acceptable time ?  If so, we'll be happy to step up and visit with you.

Thanks so much...

Teresa,

I was talking to True Quote while in New Orleans and Chris indicated that a northeast RTO was looking at potentially buying there real time system.  I am not sure why they would be looking at the system but suspect that they could use it as a means of communicating with the individual asset owners.  Maybe they would use it to display capacity and prices from the asset owners.  My desire to talk to the desk is to see if they can help me get a better idea of what the RTO's will be doing and to see if they had any ideas on how to structure a deal for the RTO's.  PJM seems to be a front runner in developing solutions for RTO's and has in fact created a company called PJM Tech.  Apparently they came to talk to us in the past.  I have a good contact at PJM but what to clear a meeting with the desk first.

Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Industrial Information Resources'
Ethanol Production Package Forecasts $4 Billion in Capital Spending
Through 2005, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

	   Business Editors & Energy Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 15, 2002--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Incorporated;
Houston, Texas). Today, synthetic fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel
are emerging as the renewable fuels of the future. New requirements
for reformulated gasoline, particularly in California, mean that the
gasoline additive MTBE no longer meets requirements and that its usage
may be environmentally hazardous. In California, the state air quality
board is requiring the removal of MTBE from gasoline by
December 31, 2002, making ethanol a likely substitute. Thirteen other
states are investigating similar requirements. The controversy
surrounding MTBE presents new opportunities for the ethanol industry
for the future.
	   The renewed interest in ethanol has prompted Industrial
Information Resources (IIR) to develop an exclusive Ethanol Production
Package (http://www.industrialinfo.com/esemdethanolpp.htm) to track
the new developments occurring in the industry, along with current and
future plant production capacities, contact information, and capital
spending data. IIR is tracking over $4 billion in capital spending
expected to take place over the next three to five years. This will
more than double the current capacity of today's ethanol production
capabilities. In the year 2001, some 1.8 billion gallons were produced
in the U.S. The market for ethanol is forecasted to grow to more than
3.9 billion gallons per year by 2005.
	   Biodiesel, also known as methyl esters, is another renewable fuel
derived from new and used vegetable oils. Recent interests in
biodiesel have come about after discovering that when a mixture of 20%
biodiesel is blended with standard petroleum diesel fuel, sulfur
content will be reduced down to acceptable levels. In its pure form,
biodiesel can be used as a fuel source in most combustion engines that
accept diesel fuels. Further interest could push this product to the
commercial market in the future. Today, biodiesel fuel production is
at 61 million gallons per year. As demand grows, production is
projected to reach 100 million gallons or more annually within the
next few years.
	   A Bioenergy stimulus package currently before Congress is intended
to reduce the U.S. dependence on foreign oil by 0.5%, while
increasing the use of synthetic fuels by 0.5%. Synthetic fuel
producers are anticipating a greater role for ethanol and biodiesel
through 2005 and beyond. It is forecasted that renewable fuels could
boost the U.S. economy by $300 billion and create as many as 300,000
new jobs in the synthetic fuel sectors of the economy by 2016.

	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including alerts on industry and business trends and
project activity. The Ethanol Production Package provides a
comprehensive outline of all current development activities in the
emerging ethanol market place. This database covers 60 ethanol plants
currently in operation and 62 plants under development. For more
information on upcoming construction activities in the Synthetic Fuels
industry as well as other industrial sectors send inquiries to
synfuelsgroup@industrialinfo.com or visit us at www.industrialinfo.com

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Sasol Launches Olefin Crackers In
Malaysia For Asian Markets, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 10, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources
Incorporated, Houston). Two petrohemical projects worth $100 million
are now being launched in Malaysia by Sasol, the South African
petrochemicals and synfuels company. The first plant going on stream
at Kernith is a cracker for the production of ethylene and propylene
from natural gas. It will produce 600,000 tons of ethylene and 85,000
tons of propylene per annum. Sasol has a 12% interest in this plant,
with Malaysia's Petronas taking 64% and the U.S. company Dow 24%.
	   The adjacent plant at Petilin will produce 255,000 tons of
low-density polyethylene a year and will service markets in China,
Taiwan, other Asian countries and Africa. Sasol has a 40% share in
this plant with Petronas 40% and DSM from Holland 20%.
	   The two plants will increase Sasol's production of polyethylene by
50%. Sasol will use its 10% interest in Wesco, a distributor of
polymer products in China and Taiwan, to access Asian markets for its
Malaysian output.

market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
and industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) New South Wales Coal Project Boost By
BHP Billiton, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 10, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Incorporated, Houston). BHP Billiton has given the go ahead for
construction of the Dendrobium metallurgical coal mine in the
Illawarra region of New South Wales in Australia. Capital expenditure
on the project is estimated at $126 million with the mine scheduled to
produce 5.2 million tons of raw coal per annum.
	   The company already operates four underground coal mines in the
area with a current capacity of 7.9 million tons of clean wet coal per
annum. The coal produced is primarily suited for coking purposes.
Dendrobium, which is expected to start production in early 2005 and
reach full capacity in 2006, will replace the Elouera Colliery, which
will cease longwall operations following reserves depletion in 2005.
	   In the year ended June 2001, Illawarra Coal shipped 5.9 million
tons of coking coal from the BHP Billiton group total of 33.9 million
tons. Dendrobium will produce 2.6 million tons of metallurgical coal
to be blended for domestic and export consumption, including BHP
Steel's Port Kembia plant, and 1 million tons per annum of by-product
thermal coal for export. The project, which will employ 170, will
inject $190 million into the regional economy and generate 1,000
direct and indirect jobs using existing rail transport, coal
preparation plant and pit-top facilities.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy

Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Tall Corn Ethanol Plant Taking Shape in
Iowa, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 9, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Incorporated; Houston, Texas). Two shiny corn storage silos and a
112-foot tall dry distillers grain storage silo can be spotted from
miles away on the Carroll county landscape as another ethanol plant
begins to take shape in Iowa.
	   Tall Corn Ethanol Cooperative (Coon Rapids, Iowa) and joint
venture operating partner TCE LLC are nearing the halfway point on
completion of a $48 million ethanol plant that will convert some 14.8
million bushels per year of no. 2 yellow corn into 40 million gallons
per year of fuel grade ethanol.
	   Due to mild winter conditions in Iowa and under the direction of
leading ethanol plant constructor Broin & Associates (Sioux Falls,
S.D.), the facility is on schedule for a September 2002 completion and
start-up. Tall Corn will utilize a dry processing technology and some
120,000 tons per year of dry distillers grain by-product will be
marketed as feed additives. The plant is located in west central Iowa
in Coon Rapids, some 60 miles northwest of Des Moines.
	   The Cooperative, which consists of 450 producer and non-producer
members, has invested $9.7 million in the project and is committed to
delivering 4.85 million bushels of corn to the plant annually. Other
area farmers and cooperatives will provide the remaining bushels of
corn to reach the projected 14.8 million.
	   Jay Brunson, Synthetic Fuels Manager for Industrialinfo.com,
added, "This is one of fourteen ethanol plants that are currently
under construction or in operation in Iowa. The state is one of the
nation's leaders in ethanol production with over 418 million gallons
produced annually and when the seven new plants currently under
construction are completed sometime during mid 2003, Iowa will have
the ability to produce over 628 million gallons of ethanol per year."
Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including alerts on industry and business trends and
project activity.
	   Industrialinfo.com also provides a comprehensive Ethanol
Production Package that outlines all current development activities in
the emerging ethanol market place. This database covers 60 ethanol
plants currently in operation and 62 plants under development. For
more information on upcoming construction activities in the Synthetic
Fuels industry as well as other industrial sectors send inquiries to

Subject:  go figure

Security Level:?         Internal

 A Japanese company and an American company decided to have a canoe
race  on the Missouri river. Both teams practiced long and hard to reach

there  peak performance before the race. On the big day the Japanese won

by a  mile.

Afterwards, the American team became very discouraged and morally
depressed. The American management decided that the reason for the
crushing defeat had to be found. A "Measurement   Team," made up of
senior  management was formed. They would investigate and recommend
appropriate action.

  Their conclusion was that the Japanese had 8 people rowing and 1
person steering, while the Americans had 1 person rowing and 8 people
steering. So American management hired a consulting company and paid
them
incredible amounts of money. They advised that too many people were
steering
the boat and not enough people were rowing.

   To prevent losing to the Japanese again next year, the rowing team's
management structure was totally reorganized to 4 steering supervisors,
3 area steering superintendents and 1 assistant superintendent steering
manager. They also implemented a new performance system that would give
the  1 person rowing the boat greater incentive to work harder. It was
called the "Rowing Team Quality First Program," with meetings, dinners
and free pens for the rower:  "We must give the rower empowerment and
enrichments through this quality program."

  The next year the Japanese won by 2 miles.

   Humiliated, the American management laid off the rower for poor
performance, halted development of a new canoe, sold the paddles, and
canceled all capital investments for new equipment.  Then they gave a
High Performance Award to the steering managers and distributed the
money saved as bonuses to the senior executives.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Industrial Manufacturing Outlook To
Remain Steady In 2002, In An Advisory By Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 8, 2002--An advisory from
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Incorporated;
Houston, Texas). According to the latest release of the 2002
Industrial Outlook (http://www.industrialinfo.com/indoutlook.htm)
published by Industrial Information Resources, portions of the
industrial manufacturing sector will remain depressed for the upcoming
year. Capital spending remained moderately low in 2001 for the
automotive, printing, publishing, and plastics and rubber products
molding industries. Other industries, such as semiconductor
manufacturing and textiles and apparel, experienced depressed market
growth with very minimal capital investment taking place.
	   The automotive sector has been one of the strongest capital
spending sectors over the last several years. America's "Big Three"
producers have spent billions of dollars retooling plants to increase
production of popular sport utility vehicles (SUVs), keeping up with
demand and staying competitive with foreign automakers. One of the
major trends affecting capital spending in the automotive industry is
the continuing effort by foreign automakers to transplant production
operations to the U.S. Billions of dollars have been spent by foreign
owned automakers to construct new plants and build or expand tier
supplier parts manufacturing plants. Even with the slowdown in the
economy, this trend will continue in 2002.
	   Bring up the words "technology" or "high tech" and the general
public frowns over the losses that have been posted by this sector.
Semiconductor manufacturing has not been excluded from these losses.
Over the past several years, this sector had been a large contributor
of capital spending for the industrial manufacturing markets. In 2000,
Intel spent over $6 billion building or expanding wafer fabrication
plants. However, as the market turns down, capital budgets are cut to
make up for the losses being posted by most firms. The worst hit
semiconductor producers are those who manufacture memory devices.
Currently prices are at rock-bottom lows. In 2001, we saw plants
lay-off employees, scale back production, or even close or sell off
manufacturing assets.
	   For 2002, IIR forecasts capital and maintenance spending for the
industrial manufacturing sector to increase slightly from 2001.
Coverage of this industry includes over 30 different sectors,
including: automotive, heavy machinery, electronics, semiconductors,
textiles & apparel, printing and publishing, durable and non durable
product manufacturing. IIR's recently released 2002 Industrial
Outlook, available on CD-ROM, outlines in detail issues and trends,
including capital and maintenance spending, for the Industrial
Manufacturing Industry and other industrial market segments. For more
information on the 2002 Industrial Outlook, trends and upcoming
construction activities in the industrial manufacturing industry as
well as other industrial sectors, send inquiries to
industrialmanufacturinggroup@industrialinfo.com or visit us at
www.industrialinfo.com or www.iirenergy.com.

Dear Power Outage Database Customer, 
Attached you will find an excel document. The outages contained within are forced/derated outages. Your daily delivery will still contain these outages. 
In addition to the excel document, there is a dbf file that is formatted like the daily delivery you receive nightly. This will enable you to load the data into your regular database. Any questions please let me know. Thanks.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Toyota Motor Manufacturing North America
Nears Completion of $800 Million Expansion in Princeton, Indiana, in
an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 22, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc.;
Houston, Texas). Toyota Motor Manufacturing North America (Erlanger,
KY), a division of Toyota Motor Corporation (Aichi Prefecture, Japan)
(NYSE:TM) is nearing completion of an $800 million expansion at its
Princeton, Indiana assembly plant. Located on 1,160 acres, the
original plant was built in 1998 and is the sole manufacturer of the
new Tundra full-size pickup truck. The Tundra is Toyota's first entry
into the full-size truck market and the Princeton plant produced
56,176 Tundras in 1999 for U.S. and Canadian export markets.
	   Construction started in the spring of 2001 to expand the original
2 million square foot facility by adding 1.8 million square feet. The
investment of $800 million at this facility will raise the annual
production capacity of Tundras and Sequoias from 120,000 units to
200,000 units. The facility houses operations in stamping, body
welding, painting, plastics and assembly of the Tundra pickup truck,
Sequoia full-size sport utility vehicle, and the Sienna minivan, which
is scheduled to start production in 2003. Once this expansion is
complete, Toyota's investment at Princeton, Indiana will total $2
billion, with a capacity of 300,000 units and employment expectancy of
4,300 people. Employment is currently 2,460 at this facility.
	   Toyota employs more than 30,000 people in North America, including
approximately 20,000 at its manufacturing plants in California,
Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, West Virginia, and Ontario and British
Columbia in Canada. Once the Indiana-built Sequoias debut, Toyota will
produce eight vehicles in North America; including the Avalon, Camry,
Camry Solara, Corolla, Sequoia, Sienna, Tacoma and Tundra.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Is the Deep South the ``Detroit'' of the
Auto Making Industry for the 21st Century?, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 30, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Incorporated; Houston, Texas) Is the dominance of Detroit, MI and the
Midwest in the auto making industry nearing an end? At least a half
dozen major auto manufacturers are either looking at, or have already
built, auto-manufacturing facilities in states such as Mississippi,
Alabama, and South Carolina. Along with the new auto-manufacturing
facilities come the inevitable Tier-1 and Tier-2 support plants that
provide the parts and supplies necessary to manufacture automobiles.
The southern states are pulling out all the stops, through economic
benefits packages, to attract the automobile manufacturers and their
support structure to these non-traditional states in an effort to
boost local economies. At stake are billions of dollars and thousands
of jobs in the lucky state or states that can attract the lucrative
auto making businesses.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Canada's Iogen Produces Ethanol From
Wheat Straw, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 17, 2002--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Incorporated;
Houston). Iogen Corporation (Ottawa, Ontario) a privately held
company, is preparing final touches on a pilot scale ethanol plant to
demonstrate how ethanol can be produced from cellulose plant fibers.
	   Iogen is on target to begin producing 3,100 gallons per day of
fuel grade ethanol by the spring of 2002, utilizing approximately 40
tons per day of wheat straw feedstock. The process involves making
sugar from cellulose plant fiber. The sugars are fermented and
distilled into ethanol. Formerly, Ethanol-from-cellulose was
impractical and costly to manufacture until Iogen had success in
developing and manufacturing industrial enzymes to make ethanol fuel
out of agricultural residues.
	   The facility, located in Ottawa, Ontario Canada, has been in the
works since October of 1997. With capital assistance from Petro-Canada
(Calgary, Alberta), Iogen has made an investment of $30 million
(Canadian) to validate the usage of ethanol-from-cellulose technology.
Plans are already underway to find a site to construct a commercial
scale facility to produce roughly 50 million gallons per year of
ethanol.
	   Jay Brunson, synthetic fuels manager for Industrial Information
Resources said, "Iogen has been investigating possible sites for the
$60 plus million commercial scale plant in the United States, Canada
and the United Kingdom. We could see the first use of this type of
technology in a large scale commercial plant as early as 2004."
	   Industrial Information Resources has developed an exclusive
real-time database for the ethanol industry. The Ethanol Production
Package (http://www.industrialinfo.com/esemdethanolpp.htm) provides a
comprehensive outline of all current development activities in the
emerging ethanol market place. This database covers 60 ethanol plants
currently in operation and 62 plants under development.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including alerts on industry and business trends and
project activity. For more information on upcoming construction
activities in the synthetic fuels industry as well as other industrial
sectors send inquiries to synfuelsgroup@industrialinfo.com or visit us

We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Sithe Energies Plans Over $3 Billion in
New Power Generation in the U.S. and Canada, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 10, 2002--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc, Houston).
Sithe Energies Incorporated (New York), a Private Energy Producer
(PEP), is investing over $3 billion in new power generation for the
United States and Canada. There are six plants in various stages of
development totaling 3,700MW and five facilities under construction
with over 2,600MW of new power generation scheduled to come online
through 2005.
	   Sithe Energies currently has an 800MW plant under construction in
North Weymouth, Mass., which is expected to come on line later this
year. A proposed project in Rockland County, N.Y., referred to as
"Ramapo" has recently been cancelled due to unfavorable market
conditions.
	   Sithe owns, develops and operates power generation facilities in
North America, Canada and internationally. In North America, Sithe
currently owns and operates 27 power plants producing approximately
3,800MW and expects to increase the number of operational power
generating facilities to over 38 by 2005.
	   Sithe Energies was founded in 1984 and is one of the top five
PEP's in the world. Exelon Corporation (NYSE:EXC)(Chicago) currently
owns 49.9% of Sithe Energies and over the next 5 years, may have the
option to purchase the remaining 50.1%. Exelon was formed in October
of 2000 from the merger of PECO (NYSE:PE)(Philadelphia) and Unicom
(Chicago). With over $15 billion in annual revenues and serving over 5
million customers, Exelon has become the nation's largest unregulated
supplier of natural gas and electricity
	   Although more than 70 percent of Exelon's 19,000MW generating
capacity comes from nuclear plants, Sithe Energies North American
facilities consist primarily of fossil and hydro power generation.

RTO Week

 <?xml:namespace prefix =3D o ns =3D "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:offi=

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

=20

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices=20

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =
Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=
istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=
ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=
ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=
mpany.

General Observations


=20

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left la=
te in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t=
he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of=
 all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; =
much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme=
d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo=
rward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover for=
ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha=
t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t=
o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was d=
iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the=
 reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=
ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=
anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

=20


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was "How many RTOs?  What is their scope?"  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, "What will be standard market design?"  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, "Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?" and, "How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should "Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further."  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e "RTO Design and RTO Implementation" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule ("covered" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both "covered" and "uncovered" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., "do congestion management") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., "LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, "My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true."  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, "Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?"  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the "new" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed "successes," such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these "successes" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

The NYISO is reserving hour beginning 10:00 in the January 19, 2002
Real-Time Market.

In addition, the NYISO is reserving hours beginning 0:00 - 11:00, 13:00,
14:00 and 17:00 - 23:00 in
the January 19, 2002 Hour-Ahead locational reserve market.

Prices in the January 20, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Capital Spending for the Semiconductor
Industry Shows Positive Signs Moving Into 2002, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 17, 2002--An advisory from
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Incorporated;
Houston). Despite worldwide employment losses in the semiconductor
industry, new economic data may suggest an upturn in the industry
during the second quarter of 2002. According to the recently released
Semiconductor Billings Report produced by the Semiconductor Industry
Association (SIA) and the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials
International (SEMI) association, November 2001 global chip sales
increased by 1.5%.
	   Typically, fourth quarter sales are normally high inline with the
holiday season and though 2001 fourth quarter sales may still lag
behind historical figures, any consecutive rise in semiconductor sales
may indicate that a bottom has formed and a recovery may be near. Over
the next few months, consumer demand will dictate whether or not the
upswing in sales will continue. Currently, the two biggest consumers
of tech products relative to semiconductors are multinational
corporations and telecommunications companies. It is estimated that
global spending for hardware and software by consumers will reach $600
billion in 2002. Any further investments will be dictated by the
future state of the economy.
	   During 2001, most semiconductor manufacturers scaled back
production to reduce inventory levels while demand remained weak. Many
companies announced employee layoffs that will continue through 2002.
For example, one of the largest employment losses came from Motorola.
The company announced in December yet another layoff of 9,400
employees. By mid 2002, total losses for the company will account for
over 150,000 jobs since August 2000. NEC announced plans to suspend
chip production in Scotland and lay off 1,260 employees by April of
2002. Several domestic production plants of NEC have also been scaled
back because of the economic downturn. Santa Clara, Calif.-based
Applied Materials Inc. recently announced that approximately 450
positions at their Silicon Valley fab facility and roughly 600
positions at their Austin campus would be cut. Although the list
continues, employment data always lags behind other indicators. These
manufacturers are simply reducing costs during a period of
uncertainty.
	   As the year unfolds, semiconductor sales still remain in question.
Capital spending for the industry is expected to be down. Some
semiconductor manufacturers may continue to invest in process
automations to stay ahead of the competition. The next wave of
production technology automation will come from the transition to
300mm silicon wafer production. Semiconductor equipment vendors are
pushing hard for manufacturers to modernize into new processes. This
could come soon. Industry experts are forecasting a recovery by mid
year 2002 spurred by consumer confidence. If so, semiconductor
manufacturers may increase 2002 capital investments. With inflation
under control, combined with eleven consecutive interest rate cuts
that have made borrowing more attractive, corporations have the right
formula to move forward with automation and technology investments
that will drive semiconductor manufacturers to expand.
	   Industrialinfo.com is a leading provider of information in the
industrial markets, including the semiconductors industry. For 2002,
industrialinfo.com released the 2002 Industrial Outlook
(http://www.industrialinfo.com/indoutlook.htm) that outlines in detail
issues and trends including spending forecast for the industrial

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Certifications, Event Reporting, Metering requirements and expectations,
Deficiencies and charges, derating methodology, UCAP, etc....ALL RIPs

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) New Aluminum Bottle Products May Lead to
Increased Aluminum Usage in the Beverage Packaging Industry, in an
Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 15, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, Texas). About a year and a half ago, Daiwa Can Company,
Japan's largest aluminum can producer, began producing aluminum
bottles for beer and tea companies. The novelty has caught on in Japan
where the company produced approximately 480 million aluminum bottles
in 2001. Along with two other manufacturers of aluminum bottles,
capacity is expected to double over the next 2-3 years. All three
manufacturers of aluminum bottles in Japan are contemplating line
additions or expansions at this time.
	   The aluminum bottle can has all the attributes of the aluminum
beverage can, it is lightweight and recyclable, but is shaped like a
bottle. It comes with a resealable aluminum screw on cap, which is
also recyclable. Aluminum bottles are expected to take market share
back from PET (Plastic) bottles, which have grown in popularity lately
and have replaced both glass & metal in some markets. It's only a
matter of time before this product catches on in the U.S. and other
international markets.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including forecasts, outlooks, industry alerts, and
databases for the energy and industrial markets. For more information
on trends and upcoming construction activities for the Metals &
Minerals or Energy markets as well as other industrial sectors send
inquiries to metalsandmineralsgroup@industrialinfo.com or visit us at

"Depillo, Raymond V." <Raymond.Depillo@pseg.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

In regard to the message below, I was wondering if there is anyone out there
could shed some light on a few questions.

1.  Where could one go to find information on the Rockland Electric
reconfiguration (FERC filings or even just information updates)?
2.  Why was this not an issue in any of the longer term auctions?  Don't we
now have very inconsistent treatment across the various TCC auctions?
3.  When exactly will this happen?  Since I have yet to see a filing, can we
assume this will be done by November?  If not, it is obvious this move will
relieve congestion on Center East, and potentially lead to an
undercollection problem on TCC revenues?  If this is the case, will these
costs be socialized across all loads (TOs), or funded by the entity that
physically called for the removal of the load?
4.  What happens to any of the grandfathered rights (TCCs) associated with
serving this load?  Will the TO that served this load release those to the
market?  Will they just disappear?  Or will the TO be allowed to keep them?
5.  Will this move be coordinated with PJM or can we expect some gaps
between the treatment of the Rockland load between the two ISOs and their
various markets?

Thanks,

Ray

The five remaining rounds of the Initial Autumn 2001 TCC Auction for
Six-Month TCCs will be conducted with the Rockland Electric Company portion
of Orange & Rockland Utilities, Inc. represented as external to the New
York Control Area (NYCA).  This will reduce the load in Zone G (Hudson

PTIDs are affected by this change.

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices <?xml:namespace prefix=
 =3D o ns =3D "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =
Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=
istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=
ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=
ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=
mpany.

 General Observations

 The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left l=
ate in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, =
the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% o=
f all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed;=
 much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seem=
ed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry f=
orward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover fo=
rward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize th=
at some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed =
to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was =
discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take th=
e reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was notice=
able conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two or=
ganizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

 FERC Deliverables

A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was "How many RTOs?  What is their scope?"  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, "What will be standard market design?"  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, "Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?" and, "How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should "Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further."  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e "RTO Design and RTO Implementation" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule ("covered" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both "covered" and "uncovered" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., "do congestion management") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., "LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, "My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true."  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, "Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?"  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the "new" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed "successes," such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these "successes" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) New South Wales Coal Project Boost By
BHP Billiton, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 10, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Incorporated, Houston). BHP Billiton has given the go ahead for
construction of the Dendrobium metallurgical coal mine in the
Illawarra region of New South Wales in Australia. Capital expenditure
on the project is estimated at $126 million with the mine scheduled to
produce 5.2 million tons of raw coal per annum.
	   The company already operates four underground coal mines in the
area with a current capacity of 7.9 million tons of clean wet coal per
annum. The coal produced is primarily suited for coking purposes.
Dendrobium, which is expected to start production in early 2005 and
reach full capacity in 2006, will replace the Elouera Colliery, which
will cease longwall operations following reserves depletion in 2005.
	   In the year ended June 2001, Illawarra Coal shipped 5.9 million
tons of coking coal from the BHP Billiton group total of 33.9 million
tons. Dendrobium will produce 2.6 million tons of metallurgical coal
to be blended for domestic and export consumption, including BHP
Steel's Port Kembia plant, and 1 million tons per annum of by-product
thermal coal for export. The project, which will employ 170, will
inject $190 million into the regional economy and generate 1,000
direct and indirect jobs using existing rail transport, coal
preparation plant and pit-top facilities.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
and industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming

District UCAPRequirement



ADesell@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Due to the terrorist actions in NYC which collapsed offices in the World
Trade
   Center complex and reduced customer Load in that Transmission District,
   the
   ISO is re-calculating the Unforced Capacity ("UCAP") requirement for the
   Consolidated Edison Transmission District (CETD) and the New York
   Control
   Area.  The new UCAP requirement for the CETD for the Capability Period
   11/1/01 to 4/31/02 is 12788 MW and the total UCAP requirement for the
   New York Control Area is 32892 MW.  Changes in the UCAP requirements
   of affected LSEs will be provided to them, individually, today.

   The table below provides a comparison of the revised UCAP requirements
   to those in effect prior to this revision.


                Revised   In Effect Prior          Reduction
                10/15/2001     to 10/15/2001

   Statewide         32892 MW  33024 MW       132 MW

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Seminole Electric Commissions 500MW
Power Plant In South Central Florida, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 7, 2002--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc., Houston,
Texas). Seminole Electric Cooperative, Incorporated, (Tampa, Fla.), a
cooperative-owned public utility company, began commercial operation
on January 1, 2002 in Hardee County of a 500MW (mega-watt) power plant
in Bowling Green, Florida.
	   The Payne Creek Generating Station is configured with gas-fired
combined cycle technology utilizing two 160MW Westinghouse turbine
generator sets, two heat recovery steam generators and an 180MW
Westinghouse steam turbine generator.
	   After extensive testing and demonstrating reliable service at
various load levels in December, Seminole has begun delivering power
to the grid. The station's output economically replaces capacity
previously purchased from another Florida utility. The 1,300-acre site
was also the first successful use of reclaimed phosphate mining land
for power generating unit construction and operation.
	   Black & Veatch (Shawnee Mission, Kan.) and subsidiary Overland
Constructors constructed the $200 million plant in 21 months. It will
require 23 people to operate the plant, which is located on 6697
County Rd. 663 in Bowling Green, Florida, some 40 miles southeast of
Tampa.
	   Seminole Electric is a generation and transmission cooperative. It
provides bulk supplies of electricity to 10 member distribution
cooperatives located throughout Florida. More than 1.5 million
individuals and businesses in 45 counties utilize Seminole and its
members for electric power service.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news on the industrial market
place including specialized databases for energy specific markets. For
more information on trends and future opportunities occurring in the
Power Generation market, including other industrial and energy sectors

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Construction of Mexico's First Privately
Owned Ethylene Complex Hinges On Availability of Feedstock, in an
Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 26, 2001--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc; Houston).
Corporacion Grupo Serbo (Mexico City) first announced its intent to
construct an estimated $3 billion ethylene and derivatives complex in
Altamira, Tamaulipas earlier this year. Serbo's owner, Sergio Bolanos
Quesada, seeking partners to round out his 20% interest in the
complex, made the announcement shortly after it was revealed that
Serbo was purchasing the beleaguered engineering and construction
firm, Bufete Industrial (Mexico City). From the start, Serbo
understood that Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), the state run oil and gas
monopoly, would provide 71,000 barrels per day of naphtha feedstock
for the proposed 975,000 metric ton per year ethylene cracker.
	   Pemex has been slow to sign the 25-year contract sought by Serbo
for the complex it hopes to complete by late 2005. A need to insure
feedstock supply could possibly delay the anticipated early 2002
groundbreaking of the 10-unit complex, which will include propylene,
butadiene, polypropylene and other downstream products, as well as its
own cogeneration unit for electricity and steam. Serbo also has plans
to construct a "city" adjoining the complex, featuring homes, schools,
churches, and hospitals, among many other features over and above
those found in more traditional "company towns."
	   Serbo and its partners hope to sell 95% of the complex's output on
the domestic market, with an estimated 50% going to other
petrochemical companies in Altamira. The heavily industrialized
Altamira is home to plants owned by BASF, Shell, and other chemical
majors. Serbo would have to import its naphtha feedstock if Pemex
fails to comply with their preliminary agreement, as other naphtha
sources are simply not available domestically.
	   "With this stall, Pemex is hurting itself and quite possibly the
future of additional private petrochemical investment in Mexico,"
according to Annette Kreuger, chemical industry specialist with
Industrialinfo.com. "With Mexico's President Vicente Fox making recent
speeches that private investment is the hope for Mexico's
petrochemical future, it doesn't bode well when a state run company is
dragging its feet over its part in a $3 billion investment -- an
investment that not only increases Mexico's protection against an
anticipated surge in foreign petrochemical imports over the next few
years but also offers an increased quality of life for an estimated
2,700 future employees."

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) DOE's Vision 21 Program Sets Goal of
Zero Emission Power Plant of the Future, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 20, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston). The energy plant of the future is being developed through a
series of research projects funded jointly between the DOE (Department
of Energy) fossil energy division and private sector partners. The
Vision 21 Program seeks to develop an ultra-clean, virtually
emission-free power plant ready for commercial generation by 2015. The
program sponsors emerging state-of-the-art technologies, which will be
combined in a modular plant configuration to utilize multiple fuels
(coal, natural gas, biomass, petroleum coke, and municipal waste) and
produce electricity along with other liquid fuels and/or chemicals.
The program sets performance targets of greater than 60% fuel to
energy efficiency for coal systems and greater than 75% fuel to energy
efficiency for gas.
	   Speaking at the recent annual meeting of the Western Coal
Transportation Association, Fred Palmer, vice president of legal and
external affairs for Peabody Energy (NYSE:BTU) (St. Louis), said that
Peabody Energy is fully supporting and is an active partner in the
Department of Energy's Vision 21 Program. The goal of this innovative
program is to build the power plant of the future with essentially
zero emissions. Mr. Palmer went on to mention an ambitious coal
industry program to achieve a zero emission coal-fired power plant in
operation by 2025.
	   This summer the DOE announced the winners of the third and final
round of project funding. So far the DOE has promised $22 million to
be spent over three years on the twelve projects selected. These
projects focus on developing specific modular components of the plant
and involve fuel cell technologies, coal gasification, high strength
materials, hydrogen separation, and computer systems to name a few.

nce it  was based on wind measurements at 33 feet (the official  height for=
 wind observations), which can be 3 times as strong  as the wind at the sur=
face. In 1945, Antarctic explorers  Siple and Passel developed the first wi=
nd chill index by  measuring the heat loss from a container of water as it =
 froze while suspended from the 33-foot pole. When the old  formula was dev=
eloped, the technology did not exist to verify  the accuracy those index va=
lues.   The new formula, implemented Nov 1, 2001, uses winds measured  at 5=
 feet, which is much more representative of the wind  that a human body exp=
eriences. The new Wind Chill/Temperature  Index also makes use of advances =
in meteorology, biometeorology  and computer modeling to provide a more acc=
urate, useful  formula for calculating the dangers from winter winds and  f=
reezing temperatures. In addition, clinical trials have  been conducted and=
 the results of those trials have been  used to verify and improve the accu=
racy of the new formula.  Check out the new Wind Chill values by watching t=

Dear Market Participants,

external transactions.  SCUC will account for the minimum run-
time parameter of MHBTs in determining the least production cost
evaluation for the day.  As a result, if SCUC schedules the MHBT,
it will be scheduled at the full requested MW and requested time
frame.

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
representatve or the Help Desk at 518-356-6060.

The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 03:00, 16:00, 17:00 and 21:00 in the
January 23, 2002 Real-Time Market.

In addition, the NYISO is reserving hour beginning 17:00
in the Hour-Ahead locational reserve market.

Prices in the January 24, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) AmerenEnergy Generating Company Begins
Construction of 468MW Energy Center in Illinois, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 9, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Incorporated; Houston, Texas). AmerenEnergy Generating Company (Saint
Louis, Mo.) is currently underway with the construction of a $160
million 468 mega-watt (MW) energy center to be located in Elgin,
Illinois. AmerenEnergy is an operator of more than 3,500MW of
generating capacity.
	   Construction began in November of 2001 for The Elgin Energy
Center, located on 1559 Gifford Road near the intersection of Gifford
and Spaulding Roads in Cook County and completion is expected in the
fall of 2002.
	   Sargent & Lundy (Chicago, Ill.) was selected to provide
engineering services and Fru-Con Construction Corporation (Ballwin,
Mo.) was selected as the overall general contractor to construct the
new power station.
	   The facility will use four simple-cycle natural gas fired
turbines, which will produce up to 468MW of peak load electricity. The
turbines will have the capability to be operated with wet compression
if needed for power augmentation following achievement of normal full
load power output. Wet Compression entails introduction of water into
the inlet air duct and evaporation of the water in the compressor.
	   Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) provides electric and gas services
to customers in Missouri and Illinois through its subsidiaries,
AmerenCIPS, AmerenUE, and AmerenEnergy Generating Company.
	   Ameren has $9 billion in assets, almost $6 billion in market
capitalization and $3.5 billion in total revenues. Ameren companies'
net generating capacity is nearly 12,000MW with a total of 14
base-load and hydroelectric plants, currently employing over 7,300
people.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
and industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Industrial Manufacturing Outlook To
Remain Steady In 2002, In An Advisory By Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 8, 2002--An advisory from
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Incorporated;
Houston, Texas). According to the latest release of the 2002
Industrial Outlook (http://www.industrialinfo.com/indoutlook.htm)
published by Industrial Information Resources, portions of the
industrial manufacturing sector will remain depressed for the upcoming
year. Capital spending remained moderately low in 2001 for the
automotive, printing, publishing, and plastics and rubber products
molding industries. Other industries, such as semiconductor
manufacturing and textiles and apparel, experienced depressed market
growth with very minimal capital investment taking place.
	   The automotive sector has been one of the strongest capital
spending sectors over the last several years. America's "Big Three"
producers have spent billions of dollars retooling plants to increase
production of popular sport utility vehicles (SUVs), keeping up with
demand and staying competitive with foreign automakers. One of the
major trends affecting capital spending in the automotive industry is
the continuing effort by foreign automakers to transplant production
operations to the U.S. Billions of dollars have been spent by foreign
owned automakers to construct new plants and build or expand tier
supplier parts manufacturing plants. Even with the slowdown in the
economy, this trend will continue in 2002.
	   Bring up the words "technology" or "high tech" and the general
public frowns over the losses that have been posted by this sector.
Semiconductor manufacturing has not been excluded from these losses.
Over the past several years, this sector had been a large contributor
of capital spending for the industrial manufacturing markets. In 2000,
Intel spent over $6 billion building or expanding wafer fabrication
plants. However, as the market turns down, capital budgets are cut to
make up for the losses being posted by most firms. The worst hit
semiconductor producers are those who manufacture memory devices.
Currently prices are at rock-bottom lows. In 2001, we saw plants
lay-off employees, scale back production, or even close or sell off
manufacturing assets.
	   For 2002, IIR forecasts capital and maintenance spending for the
industrial manufacturing sector to increase slightly from 2001.
Coverage of this industry includes over 30 different sectors,
including: automotive, heavy machinery, electronics, semiconductors,
textiles & apparel, printing and publishing, durable and non durable
product manufacturing. IIR's recently released 2002 Industrial
Outlook, available on CD-ROM, outlines in detail issues and trends,
including capital and maintenance spending, for the Industrial
Manufacturing Industry and other industrial market segments. For more
information on the 2002 Industrial Outlook, trends and upcoming
construction activities in the industrial manufacturing industry as
well as other industrial sectors, send inquiries to
industrialmanufacturinggroup@industrialinfo.com or visit us at

Hello everyone, 

	More upsets in the college and pro games this week sent most people into double digit incorrect picks this week. Most people missed the Washington St/Stanford game won by Washington St; most people missed the Kansas St/Texas Tech game, won by Texas Tech; most people missed the South Carolina/Arkansas game won by Arkansas; and everyone missed the Florida/Auburn game won by Auburn. The Texas A&M/Colorado game was missed by a fair amount of people as well.

	 In the pros, quite a few people picked Baltimore to beat Green Bay, but Green Bay won; also Kansas City was picked by some people to beat Pittsburgh, however, the Steelers won; San Diego was picked by many people to beat the Patriots, however, New England won again; the Miami/Jets and Denver/Seattle games were missed by most people and even the Oakland/Indy game was commonly missed as well. 

	Through all that, I managed to get only 7 games wrong; Stanford, Kansas St, Florida, San Diego, Miami, Denver and Indianapolis. I am in the lead currently with 7 missed games with Dallas tonight, while 2 people missed 8 games with Washington tonight. The other 2 people still alive tonight are Steve Pan and Daniel Muschar. If Dallas wins tonight, I will win outright, if Washington wins, then it will come down to total points scored. I picked 31 total points, Steve picked 35 and Daniel 37. Therefore, I will win with 32 or fewer pts scored, Steve and I will split with Washington and 33 pts. and Steve will win with 34-35 points scored and tie with 36 pts. Daniel will win with Washington and 37 or more total points scored. 

	I came in a close second place last week to Joe Step. My picks were given as always to Todd or Dave on Friday for verification. There were a record 34 people in the pool this week, therefore the prize is $68. 

	This coming week and next week there is a pro game on Thursday night because of the baseball playoffs. Therefore, I will hand out the pools this week and next week on Tuesday and they will be due before I leave on THURSDAY afternoon. Finally, here are the results of this past weekend's picks with the number missed by each person after their name.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Industrial Information Resources'
Ethanol Production Package Forecasts $4 Billion in Capital Spending
Through 2005, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

	   Business Editors & Energy Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 15, 2002--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Incorporated;
Houston, Texas). Today, synthetic fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel
are emerging as the renewable fuels of the future. New requirements
for reformulated gasoline, particularly in California, mean that the
gasoline additive MTBE no longer meets requirements and that its usage
may be environmentally hazardous. In California, the state air quality
board is requiring the removal of MTBE from gasoline by
December 31, 2002, making ethanol a likely substitute. Thirteen other
states are investigating similar requirements. The controversy
surrounding MTBE presents new opportunities for the ethanol industry
for the future.
	   The renewed interest in ethanol has prompted Industrial
Information Resources (IIR) to develop an exclusive Ethanol Production
Package (http://www.industrialinfo.com/esemdethanolpp.htm) to track
the new developments occurring in the industry, along with current and
future plant production capacities, contact information, and capital
spending data. IIR is tracking over $4 billion in capital spending
expected to take place over the next three to five years. This will
more than double the current capacity of today's ethanol production
capabilities. In the year 2001, some 1.8 billion gallons were produced
in the U.S. The market for ethanol is forecasted to grow to more than
3.9 billion gallons per year by 2005.
	   Biodiesel, also known as methyl esters, is another renewable fuel
derived from new and used vegetable oils. Recent interests in
biodiesel have come about after discovering that when a mixture of 20%
biodiesel is blended with standard petroleum diesel fuel, sulfur
content will be reduced down to acceptable levels. In its pure form,
biodiesel can be used as a fuel source in most combustion engines that
accept diesel fuels. Further interest could push this product to the
commercial market in the future. Today, biodiesel fuel production is
at 61 million gallons per year. As demand grows, production is
projected to reach 100 million gallons or more annually within the
next few years.
	   A Bioenergy stimulus package currently before Congress is intended
to reduce the U.S. dependence on foreign oil by 0.5%, while
increasing the use of synthetic fuels by 0.5%. Synthetic fuel
producers are anticipating a greater role for ethanol and biodiesel
through 2005 and beyond. It is forecasted that renewable fuels could
boost the U.S. economy by $300 billion and create as many as 300,000
new jobs in the synthetic fuel sectors of the economy by 2016.

	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including alerts on industry and business trends and
project activity. The Ethanol Production Package provides a
comprehensive outline of all current development activities in the
emerging ethanol market place. This database covers 60 ethanol plants
currently in operation and 62 plants under development. For more
information on upcoming construction activities in the Synthetic Fuels
industry as well as other industrial sectors send inquiries to
synfuelsgroup@industrialinfo.com or visit us at www.industrialinfo.com

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Mountainview Power Begins Construction
of a 1,034MW Generating Unit Addition in California, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 18, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.,
Houston, Texas). Mountainview Power Company LLC (San Bernardino,
Calif.), a subsidiary of AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) (Arlington, Va.),
began construction in August for a 1,034 mega-watt (MW) natural
gas-fired combined cycle unit addition at the Mountainview Power
Station in San Bernardino, Calif. Bechtel Corporation (San Francisco,
Calif.) was awarded the engineering, procurement and construction
contract and construction completion is scheduled for the summer of
2003.
	   The new addition will consist of four Foster Wheeler heat recovery
steam generators (HRSG's) and four natural gas-fired General Electric
MS7001FA combustion turbines. Each HRSG will be equipped with a
selective catalytic reduction (SCR) unit to reduce nitrogen oxide

The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 9:00 and 12:00 in the January 16,
2002 Real-Time Market.

In addition, the NYISO is reserving hour beginning 23:00 in the January 16,
2002 Hour-Ahead locational reserve market.

Prices in the January 17, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) From Russia With South African and
Australian Associates, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

	   Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 22, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Inc., Houston, Texas). Norilsk, the Russian nickel mining corporation,
is taking its first step out of the home territories of the former
Soviet Union with its participation in the Nakety nickel project in
New Caledonia. The project is at present estimated to be worth in
excess of $500 million. Assisting in the generation of the project,
which was initiated by the Australian/Canadian company Argosy, is the
South African project development and process engineering group
Bateman Project Holdings who have worked with both of the other
project associates on previous ventures.
	   The relationship with Norilsk could grow for Bateman as the
Russians are said to be interested in base metal projects in Africa
and South Africa. The South African company has developed technologies
and management and marketing techniques to apply to the commercial
exploitation of a range of raw mineral mining projects in developing
countries. It is currently completing a $160 million gas compressor
plant in Turkmenistan, which is being followed by a similar plant in
Uzbekistan. Phosphates projects in the Middle East and Peru are also
under consideration. In Africa, it has the Skorpion zinc-mine
concentrator, refinery and smelter in Namibia, the SA Chrome project
in South Africa and diamond, cobalt and copper projects in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as the Corridor Sands project
in Mozambique.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
and industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming
construction activities for the Metals & Minerals industry as well as

The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Tall Corn Ethanol Plant Taking Shape in
Iowa, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 9, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Incorporated; Houston, Texas). Two shiny corn storage silos and a
112-foot tall dry distillers grain storage silo can be spotted from
miles away on the Carroll county landscape as another ethanol plant
begins to take shape in Iowa.
	   Tall Corn Ethanol Cooperative (Coon Rapids, Iowa) and joint
venture operating partner TCE LLC are nearing the halfway point on
completion of a $48 million ethanol plant that will convert some 14.8
million bushels per year of no. 2 yellow corn into 40 million gallons
per year of fuel grade ethanol.
	   Due to mild winter conditions in Iowa and under the direction of
leading ethanol plant constructor Broin & Associates (Sioux Falls,
S.D.), the facility is on schedule for a September 2002 completion and
start-up. Tall Corn will utilize a dry processing technology and some
120,000 tons per year of dry distillers grain by-product will be
marketed as feed additives. The plant is located in west central Iowa
in Coon Rapids, some 60 miles northwest of Des Moines.
	   The Cooperative, which consists of 450 producer and non-producer
members, has invested $9.7 million in the project and is committed to
delivering 4.85 million bushels of corn to the plant annually. Other
area farmers and cooperatives will provide the remaining bushels of
corn to reach the projected 14.8 million.
	   Jay Brunson, Synthetic Fuels Manager for Industrialinfo.com,
added, "This is one of fourteen ethanol plants that are currently
under construction or in operation in Iowa. The state is one of the
nation's leaders in ethanol production with over 418 million gallons
produced annually and when the seven new plants currently under
construction are completed sometime during mid 2003, Iowa will have
the ability to produce over 628 million gallons of ethanol per year."
Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including alerts on industry and business trends and
project activity.
	   Industrialinfo.com also provides a comprehensive Ethanol
Production Package that outlines all current development activities in
the emerging ethanol market place. This database covers 60 ethanol
plants currently in operation and 62 plants under development. For
more information on upcoming construction activities in the Synthetic
Fuels industry as well as other industrial sectors send inquiries to
synfuelsgroup@industrialinfo.com or visit us at www.industrialinfo.com

We are getting ready for the launch of "NetcoOnline" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case:

Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch "NetCoOnline".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of "NetCoOnline" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of "NetcoOnline"

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, "NetcoOnline" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

Certain individuals in the Trading and Origination groups will be contacting customers on our Top 50 list to introduce the new company and begin the process of getting signed PA's. The NetcoOnline marketing team will work with Trading and Origination groups to make sure that all Master Users that previously had EnronOnline North American Gas and Power execution rights are contacted within one week of the PA and ETA being approved by the new buyer.  NetcoOnline Marketing will follow up with the Master Users to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


NetcoOnline Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).		

Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power
Kara Boudreau (30570) - Gas
Jennifer McQuade (53614) - Power
Dan Diamond (39673) - Gas


Definitions:

Master User - Typically the company authorized signatory that signed the Password Application. Establishes transaction rights for each trader (sub-users)

Sub-User - Trader, assigned either execute or read only status 

General Terms & Conditions (GTC) - Document that governs online trades unless a Master Agreement is in place

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) ``Everything But Arms'' - EU Trade
Development Assistance Scheme, in an Advisory by industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 16, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Incorporated, Houston, Texas). Mozambique has become the first country
to take advantage of the new `Everything but Arms' initiative launched
by the European Union earlier this year. In terms of the new
regulations, certain goods originating from developing countries may
enter the EU duty-free. The first exports of sugar under the scheme
have arrived in Lisbon, bringing scarce foreign exchange and revenue
to the reviving sugar industry.
	   The past sugar season was the first time that Mozambique had
produced a crop large enough to have an exportable surplus after
meeting domestic demand. The depredations of decades of civil war
followed by two years of devastating storms and floods have dogged the
country's efforts to get up from its knees.
	   The reconstruction and rehabilitation of the sugar industry has
caused the placing of strict import controls on the commodity.
Mozambique will receive an annual allocation of the EBA quota. The
scheme began in Georgetown, Guyana in May 2001, when Mozambique
initiated the first meeting of the developing nations to ensure
efficient negotiating interaction with European refiners.

New Green Energy Power Development, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors & Environmental Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 19, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Inc.; Houston, Texas). Canada's Northwest Territories provincial
government has been looking at the region's major river systems as a
source for green or environmentally friendly hydroelectric power.
Studies indicate that the six river systems in the province could
produce 11,630 mega-watts (MW) of power. Developing hydroelectric
power of this magnitude would require about $16.6 billion for new
generation construction alone, with several billion more needed for
power transmission line and infrastructure construction.
	   The largest river system in the province, the Mackenzie River
system, has the greatest potential for future development. It is
estimated that the river system has the capacity to support the bulk
of studied new hydroelectric generation construction at around $14
billion.
	   Utilization of green power instead of fossil fuels for new power
plants could reduce future CO2 emissions in Canada by approximately
50% and supports the provinces' push for greenhouse gas emission
reductions. In addition, communities in the region would be able to
share over $428 million of power sales related revenues annually from
power companies locating in the area. These power projects can also
stimulate industrial growth by attracting new support businesses to
the area.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy &
industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming
construction activities in the Power and Energy markets as well as
other industrial sectors send inquiries to
powergroup@industrialinfo.com or visit our Web site at

RBowers@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

In its Order on Rehearing issued by FERC in Docket ER00-1969-002 on
November 8, 2001, the Commission directed the NYISO to re-calculate
operating reserve charges for March 2000 within 15 days.

The  NYISO  initiated  the  rebilling of March 2000 settlements through the
settlement  adjustment  process  on  the  afternoon  of  November 21, 2001.
Advisory  billing  statements  have  been posting to customer web locations
since  midnight November 22, 2001.  The NYISO anticipates completion of the
March 2000 settlement adjustment at approximately 18:00, November 23, 2001.
Posting  of  advisory billing statements will continue through the evening,
but should complete by 23:00.  Invoices are scheduled to be posted for this
settlement adjustment on, or about, December 7, 2001.

Randy A. Bowers

                    AM                   Subject:     FERC ruling on March 2000 Operating Reserves





In  its  Order  on  Rehearing  issued  by  FERC  in Docket ER00-1969-002 on
November 8, 2001, the Commission rejected the NYISO's request for rehearing
to  continue  to  bill for operating reserves based on the $2.52 bid cap in
effect  for  the period March 1 through March 27, 2000.  FERC also directed
the NYISO to re-calculate operating reserve charges for that period without
the bid cap in place.

On Friday, November 16, 2001, the NYISO filed a stay/extension with FERC in
order  to postpone any re-billing pending an appeal of the FERC decision in
the  Federal Appeals Court. In the event that FERC does not act in a timely
manner   on  the  NYISO's  request,  the  upcoming  March  2000  settlement
adjustment,  expected  to  be  issued  on  or  about December 7, 2001, will
reflect  this  re-calculation in accordance with the FERC Order.  The total
amount  of  this  adjustment  is  approximately  $27 million, which will be
allocated  to the appropriate suppliers and LSE's for the period of March 1
through March 27, 2000.

high into the air at first. It was just overwhelming. You
wondered, 'Where do you start?' Now it is a gaping hole
four levels down into the ground. I just can't understand
how they did it that quickly."
-CAPT. RAYMOND REILLY, of the Fire Department, referring to ground zero.

During the course of their investigation, Special Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be taking documents they believe may be important for their investigation from employees' offices.  The FBI has agreed to return copies of such documents. 

In addition, should you have an immediate need for a document requested by the FBI, please make a copy of the specific document and give the original to the FBI. Thank you for your cooperation.

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

>From Kevin Hannon, Jim Hughes and John Lavorato

Our efforts to move our South American merchant business model to look like our North American and European models has been evolving quickly.  In the volatile Brazilian power market, Enron is poised to start-up the first merchant plant in the near future.  We are working on several structured transactions and are at the forefront in working with Brazilian regulators to create a viable deregulated power market.

To continue our positive momentum in South America, we have decided to change the leadership of the merchant business.  We have asked Orlando Gonzalez to become President and CEO.  In addition we have asked Brett Wiggs to join Orlando in the office of the chairman as Chief Commercial Officer.

Joe Kishkill has been involved in the South American business for many years and will be exploring other opportunities within Enron.  We would like to thank Joe for his contributions.  

Please join us in congratulating Orlando and Brett on their new duties.

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 15, 2001--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.; Houston,
Texas). Brach & Brock Confections Incorporated (Chicago, Ill.), a
privately held company, has begun construction on a new $50 million
confections plant in Linares, Nuevo Leon, Mexico.
	   Site work commenced back in mid September on a 350,000 square foot
plant that will be the new home to Brach's line of candy corn and
other seasonal confectionary products that used to be produced at the
soon to be phased out plant in Chicago, Illinois.
	   Jacobs Severdrup (Saint Louis, Mo.) is providing design services
and their Mexico division, Kujesa-Jacobs (Mexico City, District
Federale Mexico), will install the production lines and provide
construction management services. Group Garza Punzo (Monterrey, Nuevo
Leon, Mexico) will act as the general contractor for the 350,000
square foot production building shell. The project is scheduled for
completion in August of 2003.
	   Industrialinfo.com reported back in January 2001 that the company
had announced plans for a phased shutdown of the 2.3 million square
foot Chicago confections plant due to high domestic sugar prices, the
age of the nearly century old facility and consolidation among major
candy players. All manufacturing operations in Chicago will cease by
the end of 2003, but their headquarters will remain there.
	   Originally founded in 1904 by Emil J. Brach, Brach Confections
purchased Brock Candy Company in 1994 forming Brach & Brock
Confections Incorporated, which produces over 200 varieties of
candies, chocolates and fruit snacks.
	   For more information on trends and upcoming construction
activities in the Food and Beverage market as well as other industrial
sectors send inquiries to foodandbeveragegroup@industrialinfo.com or

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ."  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."

International Power Receives 2001 Final Dividend Payment From Hubco

International Power today received from The Hub Power Company (Hubco) GBP 7
million as final dividend for the year ended 30 June 2001.

This is the second dividend paid by Hubco following the resolution of its
dispute with Pakistan's Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA).

"The timely payment of this dividend demonstrates WAPDA's commitment to
Hubco and also indicates that dividend payments from Hubco can now be
expected as normal course of business", said Peter Giller, International
Power's Chief Executive Officer.

Notes to the Editors:

International Power has a 25.7% equity interest in Hubco. An interim
dividend for the year ended 30 June 2001 was paid to shareholders in
December 2001, which was the first dividend paid to Hubco shareholders
following the settlement of a tariff dispute that caused the suspension of
all dividend payments for a three-year period beginning in 1998.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Capital Spending for the Semiconductor
Industry Shows Positive Signs Moving Into 2002, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 17, 2002--An advisory from
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Incorporated;
Houston). Despite worldwide employment losses in the semiconductor
industry, new economic data may suggest an upturn in the industry
during the second quarter of 2002. According to the recently released
Semiconductor Billings Report produced by the Semiconductor Industry
Association (SIA) and the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials
International (SEMI) association, November 2001 global chip sales
increased by 1.5%.
	   Typically, fourth quarter sales are normally high inline with the
holiday season and though 2001 fourth quarter sales may still lag
behind historical figures, any consecutive rise in semiconductor sales
may indicate that a bottom has formed and a recovery may be near. Over
the next few months, consumer demand will dictate whether or not the
upswing in sales will continue. Currently, the two biggest consumers
of tech products relative to semiconductors are multinational
corporations and telecommunications companies. It is estimated that
global spending for hardware and software by consumers will reach $600
billion in 2002. Any further investments will be dictated by the
future state of the economy.
	   During 2001, most semiconductor manufacturers scaled back
production to reduce inventory levels while demand remained weak. Many
companies announced employee layoffs that will continue through 2002.
For example, one of the largest employment losses came from Motorola.
The company announced in December yet another layoff of 9,400
employees. By mid 2002, total losses for the company will account for
over 150,000 jobs since August 2000. NEC announced plans to suspend
chip production in Scotland and lay off 1,260 employees by April of
2002. Several domestic production plants of NEC have also been scaled
back because of the economic downturn. Santa Clara, Calif.-based
Applied Materials Inc. recently announced that approximately 450
positions at their Silicon Valley fab facility and roughly 600
positions at their Austin campus would be cut. Although the list
continues, employment data always lags behind other indicators. These
manufacturers are simply reducing costs during a period of
uncertainty.
	   As the year unfolds, semiconductor sales still remain in question.
Capital spending for the industry is expected to be down. Some
semiconductor manufacturers may continue to invest in process
automations to stay ahead of the competition. The next wave of
production technology automation will come from the transition to
300mm silicon wafer production. Semiconductor equipment vendors are
pushing hard for manufacturers to modernize into new processes. This
could come soon. Industry experts are forecasting a recovery by mid
year 2002 spurred by consumer confidence. If so, semiconductor
manufacturers may increase 2002 capital investments. With inflation
under control, combined with eleven consecutive interest rate cuts
that have made borrowing more attractive, corporations have the right
formula to move forward with automation and technology investments
that will drive semiconductor manufacturers to expand.
	   Industrialinfo.com is a leading provider of information in the
industrial markets, including the semiconductors industry. For 2002,
industrialinfo.com released the 2002 Industrial Outlook
(http://www.industrialinfo.com/indoutlook.htm) that outlines in detail

The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 16:00 and 17:00 in the January 25,
2002 Real-Time Market.

Prices in the January 26, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

Due to the terrorist actions in NYC which collapsed offices in the World
Trade
   Center complex and reduced customer Load in that Transmission District,
   the
   ISO is re-calculating the Unforced Capacity ("UCAP") requirement for the
   Consolidated Edison Transmission District (CETD) and the New York
   Control
   Area.  The new UCAP requirement for the CETD for the Capability Period
   11/1/01 to 4/31/02 is 12788 MW and the total UCAP requirement for the
   New York Control Area is 32892 MW.  Changes in the UCAP requirements
   of affected LSEs will be provided to them, individually, today.

   The table below provides a comparison of the revised UCAP requirements
   to those in effect prior to this revision.

The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 16:00 and 22:00 in the January 14,
2002 Real-Time Market.

In addition, the NYISO is reserving hours beginning 9:00 and 18:00 in the
January 14, 2002 Hour-Ahead locational reserve market.

Prices in the January 15, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

I wasn't sure if this was distributed. As you know the NYISO with LECG did a
pretty good critical review of the problems with the MIRANT study, most of
which I agreed with. However, I also thought that from a back of the
envelope perspective MIRANT had come up with a reasonable number using a
non-supportable methodology.

PJM has apparently revisited the issue. They have tried to estimate regional
savings from an integrated commitment and energy market. They did this for a
single year, 2001. They ran GEMAPS. The data for the system topology and
contingencies was obtained from all three ISO's. They used RDI data on
generator costs. The results are striking and a summary is attached.

While I am sure we are going to see more argument and debate about the data,
the transactions baseline etc., this is a pretty good first cut at what is
at stake. The general methodology is correct, and the data doesn't seem too
bad to me. It would make sense for the NYISO to again take a look at this so
that all of the participants can evaluate the implications if there are
indeed $600 million of potential production cost savings for NY.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Liquefied Natural Gas -LNG- Receiving
Terminals Making Progress Toward Fruition, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 23, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources
Incorporated; Houston). In an article written on July 18, 2001
concerning the future demand for natural gas in North America,
Industrial Information Resources identified LNG terminals as part of
the solution to the supply and demand problem. The demand for natural
gas is still expected to reach 30 trillion cubic feet per year by the
end of the decade, leading to a deficit of 8 trillion cubic feet a
year over today's production. Importing LNG by tanker to a terminal
and then regasifying the liquid before introducing it to the pipeline
system is a very economical way of obtaining a supply of natural gas.
	   Since July of 2001, one LNG terminal has been reactivated adding
600 million cubic feet per day to the supply side and bringing the
total receiving capacity to 2.8 billion cubic feet per day of natural
gas from three operational LNG terminals. Of the 23 operational
terminals, one is near completion of an expansion and another is
planning a further expansion to begin construction in mid 2002. A
fourth terminal with a capacity of 750 million cubic feet per day on
the East Coast is in the process of reactivation. After the addition
of an 850,000 barrel insulated LNG storage tank, the facility will be
ready to receive its first tanker load in the fall of 2002 and has
further expansion plans to double the size by 2005.
	   Since July the total number of planned LNG terminals has increased
from 10 to 12 in North America. The average capacity of each will be
about 750 million cubic feet per day. Two will be located in Canada,
six in the U.S. and 4 in Mexico. The actual number moving ahead since
July is somewhat different and reduces the number to one in Canada and
two in the U.S. Three of the four in Mexico have moved into the
permitting stage and two of these are seeking E+P+C contractors, while
the third has already selected one. These projects run an average of
$350 to $400 million apiece and most have multiple phases carrying out
to 2008.
	   Ed Weatherly, Petroleum Terminals Group Manager with Industrial
Information Resources, stated, "I believe that at least seven of these
terminals will be constructed and therefore introduce 5.25 billion
cubic per day of natural gas into the pipeline grids of Canada,
Mexico, and the U.S. by late 2005. LNG has a regasification ratio of
618:1 at a specific gravity of 0.43 which will allow the average LNG
tanker to carry 2.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas in a liquid
form, which is about a 3.5 day supply for the average LNG terminal
being planned. I think that there is a growing interest in these
capital intensive projects and by the end of 2002 we should have a
good idea of which of the players will get to market first and supply
the natural gas needed in the energy industry. There have been ripples
in the marketplace as of late, but there will still be many electrical
plants with natural gas as the primary fuel type coming on line over
the next decade."

Dear Power Outage Database Customer, 
Attached you will find an excel document. The outages contained within are forced or rescheduled outages. Your daily delivery will still contain these outages. 
In addition to the two excel documents, there is a dbf file that is formatted like your daily deliveries you receive nightly. This will enable you to load the data into your regular database. Any questions please let me know. Thanks.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Texas prepares for Power Deregulation,
in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 16, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, Texas) Texas residents and businesses are preparing for
deregulation that begins in the state on January 1, 2002 by educating
themselves on how electric provider choices can benefit them.
Depending on your geographical location, savings are being forecasted
between $14-$21 per month depending on your electric provider.
	   The Texas plan ranks among the best in the country in its approach
to electric restructuring through reasons like uniform business
practices and codes of conduct that were not present during the
deregulation of California. The state is primed for a successful
transition into a competitive electric retail market and other states
are watching as well to see how smoothly the transition proceeds.
	   Others hoping to benefit from deregulation are the Private Energy
Producers (PEP's) who will construct and operate new power plants
across the state. The Calpine's, Duke Energy's and the Kinder Morgan
Power's of the world will replace familiar utility company names like
Reliant Energy, American Electric Power and TXU Electric on electric
bills.
	   The majority of Texans will be able to choose a new Retail
Electric Provider (REP) as of January 1, 2002 and up to 5% of
customers are getting a head start on electric choice by participating
in a pilot program. Customers can pick and choose a provider based on
whether they want to save money, support environmentally friendly
sources of generation, seek better customer service, or stay with a
brand name they know and trust.
	   In Texas alone, Industrialinfo.com is tracking 49 PEP projects.
These projects are in various phases of development from planned,
engineered and under construction. In all, these projects represent
some 33,447MW of electric generation capacity and have an estimated
construction value of over $19.6 billion. Industrialinfo.com
speculates all 49 new power plants to be on-line by 2006.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
and industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming
construction activities for the Energy and Power markets as well as
other industrial sectors send inquiries to
powergroup@industrialinfo.com or visit us at www.industrialinfo.com.

As we continue to address a number of issues facing Enron, it is critical that the company remain focused on attracting, motivating and retaining a diverse and talented workforce.  We strongly believe that our workforce is world-class -- the best in any industry, so we will continue to develop and reward this tremendous talent base.
 
Because the lasting strength of our company is determined by the strength of our workforce, we are elevating the role employee-focused functions play within Enron.  We are pleased to announce that effective immediately Human Resources, Employee Responsibility, and Executive and Corporate Compensation will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.
 
David Oxley, Vice President, will continue to oversee Enron's Global HR function.  The lead HR representatives for the individual business units will report to David in addition to their respective Office of the Chairman.  Besides managing Recruiting, Staffing, Training, Compensation and the Performance Evaluation Process, David will also add Payroll and Labor Relations to his list of responsibilities.
 
Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President, will have responsibility for Employee Relations and Corporate Responsibility, which includes Social Responsibility, Community Relations, Diversity, Employee Relations, Redeployment, Alumni Relations, Employee Events and Programs, Benefits, Wellness, and Worklife.
 
Mary Joyce, Vice President, will continue to have responsibility for Executive and Corporate Compensation in addition to Global Employee Information Management and Reporting and Analysis.
 
David, Cindy and Mary will each report to the Office of the Chairman.  A detailed organizational chart is attached.  Please join me in congratulating David, Cindy and Mary on their new responsibilities.

with respect to its unilateral modification of Market Rule 5 and Appendix 5-C of the

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Canada's Iogen Produces Ethanol From
Wheat Straw, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 17, 2002--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Incorporated;
Houston). Iogen Corporation (Ottawa, Ontario) a privately held
company, is preparing final touches on a pilot scale ethanol plant to
demonstrate how ethanol can be produced from cellulose plant fibers.
	   Iogen is on target to begin producing 3,100 gallons per day of
fuel grade ethanol by the spring of 2002, utilizing approximately 40
tons per day of wheat straw feedstock. The process involves making
sugar from cellulose plant fiber. The sugars are fermented and
distilled into ethanol. Formerly, Ethanol-from-cellulose was
impractical and costly to manufacture until Iogen had success in
developing and manufacturing industrial enzymes to make ethanol fuel
out of agricultural residues.
	   The facility, located in Ottawa, Ontario Canada, has been in the
works since October of 1997. With capital assistance from Petro-Canada
(Calgary, Alberta), Iogen has made an investment of $30 million
(Canadian) to validate the usage of ethanol-from-cellulose technology.
Plans are already underway to find a site to construct a commercial
scale facility to produce roughly 50 million gallons per year of
ethanol.
	   Jay Brunson, synthetic fuels manager for Industrial Information
Resources said, "Iogen has been investigating possible sites for the
$60 plus million commercial scale plant in the United States, Canada
and the United Kingdom. We could see the first use of this type of
technology in a large scale commercial plant as early as 2004."
	   Industrial Information Resources has developed an exclusive
real-time database for the ethanol industry. The Ethanol Production
Package (http://www.industrialinfo.com/esemdethanolpp.htm) provides a
comprehensive outline of all current development activities in the
emerging ethanol market place. This database covers 60 ethanol plants
currently in operation and 62 plants under development.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Shell and Eskom Get Together in $540
Million Power Boost Project for Nigeria, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 28, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, TX). A $540 million contract has been awarded to the Shell
Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC) for two major
gas-fired projects at the Afam Power plant near Port Harcourt. The
contract from the National Power Authority (Nepa) is in line with the
Nigerian Independent Power Producer Program that is set to break
Nepa's monopoly by licensing local and foreign private investors.
	   The contracts to refurbish, operate and transfer the Afam I-IV
plant and to lease, operate and transfer the Afam V plant will involve
Shell taking over the existing assets in 2002 and operating the Afam
power plant for a period of fifteen years.
	   The projects will be undertaken in conjunction with Eskom
Enterprises of South Africa who will act as operations and maintenance
contractor to Shell. Eskom will handle the daily running of the plant
and supervise the overall contract and project management of the
construction phase.
	   The Afam power plant currently supplies about 240MW to Nigeria's
national power grid. The new investments are expected to make around
400MW available to the Nigerian national grid in 2002, increasing to
930MW by 2004. After the rehabilitation of the existing plant and the
commissioning of Afam V, Nigeria's national generating capacity will
be increased by 20% which could help to cure chronic outages in a
country where only 36% of the population has electricity.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Pebble Bed Modular Reactor Design Pushes
Renewed Interest in Worldwide Nuclear Power Generation, in an Advisory
by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 30, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc;
Houston): The rehabilitation of nuclear power generation plants, which
could represent part of the answer to world's power generation needs
over the next 30 years, has taken a few steps forward in the
consciousness of governments and industry in the past six months.
However, nuclear power still has a way to go among environmental
groups and those involved with post-Chernobyl public health concerns.
	   The Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) from Eskom in South Africa
continues to claim the attention of both the large power hungry
regions and the capital conscious development areas to which the
modular and smaller output plant could be both affordable and
appropriate.
	   Stakeholders in the project include the U.S. company Exelon with
12.5%, Eskom with 30%, British Nuclear Fuels with 22.5%, Industrial
Development Corporation of SA with 25%, and Black empowerment at 10%.
Currently, Exelon is negotiating for the possible purchase of 40 PBMRs
at a price of around $6 billion (USD). Early in 2001 the company
requested the U.S. National Regulatory Commission to start laying the
groundwork for PBMR licensing.
	   Exelon would like to see the $300 million demonstration unit,
which is planned by Eskom in South Africa as a proven model, to show
that all technical matters have been resolved and that safety,
efficiency and viability are proven enough for U.S. regulatory
agencies to proceed forward with licensing. The plant is to be built
alongside the existing nuclear power station at Koeberg in the Cape
Province of South Africa with work commencing in 2003. If approved,
Exelon may then start concurrent construction of U.S. sites to bring
PBMR-generated power to market at the earliest possible date and at
the best price. Specifications and claims by Eskom, who purchased the
technology after a 21-year development and proving period in Germany,
present the PBMR as small, safe, clean, cost efficient, inexpensive
and adaptable.
	   The PBMR uses multiple coated uranium particles encased in
graphite to form a fuel sphere (60mm in diameter). The PBMR design
makes use of helium as the coolant and energy transfer medium to a
closed cycle gas turbine and generator. The design differences between
the PBMR and Pressurized Water Reactors result in the PBMR being a
safe and economical power plant.
	   The annual world market for power generation is estimated at $70
billion. The PBMR, if it comes through its regulatory trials, would be
in a position to capture a tasty slice of this power action. With 10%
of the shareholding in the PBMR project reserved for new black
empowerment shareholders, 10 plant export orders a year could
contribute nearly $1 billion a year to South Africa's Gross Domestic
Product and another $1 billion in export income. An estimated 57,000
direct and indirect jobs would be created. These figures would double
and triple for 20 or 30 orders annually. If the demo plant achieves
its targets, Eskom will place an order for 10 modules, with the Exelon
order hopefully kicking in immediately for a possible date for the
first U.S. plant in 2007.
	   Eskom will sell PBMR's as a manufactured item with no rights
given. Eighty percent of the costs will be made up of the manufactured
reactor and 20% site construction related. The aim is for 40% of the
sourcing to come from South Africa. Taxpayers money (approximately $50
million so far) is being spent by the South African authorities in
giving all due diligence to the studies and to public feedback on the
project before the "go" decision is given. With this right and proper
concern and the considerable market presence of Eskom and Exelon the
130MW modules will no doubt play a crucial role in the future of
nuclear power generation.
	   The project managers are indicating growing confidence in their
ability to bring the product to market and have recently made a
significant move. A contract has been placed (in mid-January 2002)
with the U.S. company Stone & Webster and South African construction
company Murray & Roberts and black empowerment contractor Proman
Management Services to provide consulting services to the PBMR project
in engineering, procurement, construction management and project
management. Following this development, the PBMR management at Eskom
have gone on record to state that with the multi-national and
multi-disciplinary support now providing leverage, the approval
hurdles for the pilot project should be cleared by the end of 2002
given the crucial general diligence and environmental clearance by the
government.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Drilling Deep Oil Reserves Offshore
Angola, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 16, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, Texas). Girassol, the Angolan offshore, deepwater oil project
run by TotalFinaElf is set to raise the country's daily output by over
25% from 750,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 950,000 bpd. The US$2.7
billion project is expected to start pumping by the end of 2001 and to
have 40 wells at a depth of 1,360m producing 200,000 bpd.
	   It is estimated that a number of the wells could produce 40,000
bpd. Partners in Block 17 with TotalFinaElf are Exxon-Mobil, BP,
Statoil from Norway and Norsk Hydro with stakes ranging from 10% to
20%. Claiming that the 1,300m riser tower is the tallest offshore
structure in the world, the company has installed a floating storage
and production vessel (FPSO) with a capacity of two million barrels of
crude. The potential of this and two other discoveries in the area
with a combined total of around three billion barrels has motivated
the company to meet and solve the challenges of ultra deep water
drilling.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Uncertainty Around the Phase-Out of
MTBE Gives Producers Time to Evaluate Options, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 29, 2002--The following in an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources
Incorporated; Houston). MTBE (Methyl Tertiary-Butyl Ether) producers
across the U.S. and Canada have been preparing for the elimination or
reduction of MTBE as a fuel oxygenate for several years. The potential
extension of California's year-end deadline could buy some additional
time for gasoline producers to evaluate technologies capable of
producing suitable substitutes or securing agreements for Ethanol
feedstocks.
	   MTBE production increased tremendously in the late 80's and early
90's as legislation prompted its use in RFG (Re-Formulated Gasoline)
programs and by the mid 90's MTBE approached oversupply. Under growing
pressure from environmentalists with concerns of MTBE contaminating
water supplies in several western states, demand somewhat leveled off
in the late 90's and new capacity has rarely been seen since. In March
of 1999, Governor Gray Davis issued an executive order establishing a
self-imposed deadline of Dec. 31, 2002 to eliminate MTBE's use in all
gasoline produced in the State of California. Failed attempts to
convince the EPA to waive the oxygenate requirements for RFG fuels
combined with limited suitable substitutes might create the need to
delay the current deadline and open the door for producers to continue
production in the near future. Producers as far away as Canada and the
Rocky Mountains stand to gain greatly should the deadline be delayed.
	   Although a phase-out of MTBE across the country any time soon is
very unlikely, several U.S. and Canadian MTBE producers are investing
in studies to identify potential replacements that could be produced
with retrofits of the existing units currently in operation. Overseas
markets could hold some potential for domestic producers as there is
no indicator to suggest that overseas markets will not continue to
grow. In fact, the European Union has determined that there needs to
be tighter control over the handling and storage of MTBE and that it
does not present a health danger. Europe is expected to include MTBE
as a key player in its future development plans for cleaner burning
fuels.

Hey Paul,
I know you're busy, but can you let me know where to find the map detailing the Northeast transfers limits you included in the presentation you put together for Dana.
I'd like to include it in a presentation I'm putting together for John Llodra.
Thanks,
Max

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Sands Running for South
African/Australian Mining Venture, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors & Environmental Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 19, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Inc., Houston, Texas). The joint venture Ticor SA, between Kumba
Resources, the mining arm of Iscor the South Africa steel company, and
Australia's Ticor, has brought in the biggest Australian investment to
South Africa to date. Kumba has sold 40% of their heavy minerals sand
mining project near Richard Bay off the Kwazulu-Natal Indian Ocean
coast. Kumba banked approximately $40 million on the signing of the
deal and Ticor has the option to increase its stake to 80% when the
$130 million smelter is completed during the second phase of the
project at the end of 2003.
	   With this venture, Ticor could double the company's profit, as
titanium dioxide slag production would double to 100,000 tons per
annum. This would mean that Ticor could control 11% of global titanium
feedstock, making it the third largest producer in the world. The new
project would also make South Africa the world leader in titanium
oxide production. The 80 million tons of heavy mineral reserves at the
Hillendale mine will represent the first phase and will be undertaken
with hydraulic mining methods. Reserves are expected to last about ten
years but the operation could be extended to 22 years by starting new
mines at Fairbreeze to the south before the Hillendale deposit runs
out. The project is expected to attract $110 million of foreign
investment in the next two years and has established a community
development program in the area. Environmental protection and safety
have also received priority attention as have other sand mining
projects in the area.

Dear Power Outage Database Customer, 
Attached you will find an excel document. The outages contained within are forced or rescheduled outages. Your daily delivery will still contain these outages. 
In addition to the two excel documents, there is a dbf file that is formatted like your daily deliveries you receive nightly. This will enable you to load the data into your regular database. Any questions please let me know. Thanks.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Pipe Link Through Algeria Could Bring
Nigerian Gas to Europe, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 7, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources
Incorporated, Houston, Texas). Nigeria and Algeria have signed a
memorandum of understanding, which could see Nigerian gas being
exported to Europe by pipeline. The pipeline construction studies to
be undertaken between the two countries will look at a route from
southern Nigeria, through Abuja and across Niger and the Sahara Desert
to Beni Saf on Algeria's Mediterranean coast. Beni Saf is planned as
the terminus for the proposed pipeline between Algeria and Spain.
	   The original project to build a pipeline around the West African
coast to Algeria did not progress, although it spawned the West Africa
Gas Pipeline between Ghana, Nigeria, Togo and Benin, which is now
scheduled for construction.
	   The new plan will need 4,000 kms of pipe laying at a cost
estimated between $5 and $7 billion and would see Nigerian gas flowing
through the new line to Spain and the existing line to Italy.
	   In the wake of the Enron debacle, Nigeria LNG, Italy's ENI, and
Spain's Iberdrola are looking at the gap which will occur for the
Bonny liquefied gas complex if the US company's intention to buy 4
billion cubic meters a year has evaporated. This could motivate action
plans for the new pipeline. So far, the Spanish have signed for 1.5
billion cubic meters and the Italians 1 billion cubic meters of gas
and February 2002 is the scheduled decision time on whether to go
ahead with production from the planned fourth and fifth trains at the
Bonny complex.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
and industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming
construction activities for the Oil & Gas Transmission markets as well

RBowers@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

In its Order on Rehearing issued by FERC in Docket ER00-1969-002 on
November 8, 2001, the Commission rejected the NYISO's request for rehearing
to continue to bill for operating reserves based on the $2.52 bid cap in
effect for the period March 1 through March 27, 2000.  FERC also directed
the NYISO to re-calculate operating reserve charges for that period without
the bid cap in place.

On Friday, November 16, 2001, the NYISO filed a stay/extension with FERC in
order  to postpone any re-billing pending an appeal of the FERC decision in
the  Federal Appeals Court. In the event that FERC does not act in a timely
manner   on  the  NYISO's  request,  the  upcoming  March  2000  settlement
adjustment,  expected  to  be  issued  on  or  about December 7, 2001, will
reflect  this  re-calculation in accordance with the FERC Order.  The total
amount  of  this  adjustment  is  approximately  $27 million, which will be
allocated  to the appropriate suppliers and LSE's for the period of March 1
through March 27, 2000.

Also attached, please find an Excel file with very rough first draft of a

The goal will be to solicit comments from the BAWG members and NYISO Grid
Accounting staff at the November 28 meeting to correct all the rows and

All right ladies and gentlemen - here's the skinny on Tahoe... to refresh
your memory for those of you who went last year, we stayed in Tahoe City,
skiing Squaw and Alpine Meadows.  This year to add a little variety I was
thinking South Lake Tahoe, which is closer to Heavenly and Kirkwood and
includes more of a night life, such as casinos for those of us who are
gambling challenged...  So here are the details:

Dates:
The 2nd weekend of March, 3/8-3/10 appears to work best for everyone
(especially after enough whining by Reagan).

Accommodations:
There are a couple of 3-bdrm. condos next door to each other at the Tahoe
Keys for $300/night, sleeping 8-10 people each...  You can do the math, but
it will probably come out to about $35/person/night, give or take...  Most
of these places have a 3-night minimum, so if everyone can get away Thurs.
after work, we could plan on at least staying Thurs-Sat. nights and skiing
Fri, Sat., & possibly Sunday.

Transportation:
They have round trip shuttles from Reno to SLT for about $70 or $75, or we
could rent one or two SUVs or vans at the airport - I'll leave that up to
yall as I'll be cruising in from my crib Sac-town...  Check into flights
from your respective cities, but I believe SW has $99 each way from
Austin...

So that we can go ahead and book these condos, we need to get confirmations
from everyone interested in going as soon as possible - also let me know if
you can make it up Thurs. nite...

Peace,
Chris

Chris, it looks like Smokey and Durkee can get off
work the weekend of the 8th and 9th after all.  That
would actually be a better week for mr 5too because I
wouldn't have to miss any school.  Let me know how
many people you have interested so I can make
arrange,ments.
Aloha, Sean

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Amgen Wins, ImClone Loses in FDA
Approval Gamble, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

	   Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 24, 2002--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc; Houston,
Texas). With untold millions at stake, drug companies find themselves
playing against dreadful odds with each new product in development.
Beyond the incredible expense of drug development and the strenuous
clinical trial process, manufacturers also have the responsibility to
take it to market. Two recent FDA decisions illustrate just what a
gamble the entire process is.
	   Amgen, Inc. (Thousand Oaks, CA) (NasdaqNM:AMGN) chose to lay a
wager in the form of over $200 million in manufacturing facilities at
their 232-acre Longmont, Colorado campus, years prior to FDA approval
of their drug Aranesp, for patients with anemia-related kidney
problems. It appears likely to pay off with the potential $5 billion
in sales they expect the recently approved Aranesp to help generate.
	   ImClone Systems, Inc. (New York, NY) (NasdaqNM:IMCL), thinking
they had a sure winner in Erbitux, a treatment for colon cancer,
invested $40 million at their Branchburg, NJ facility. ImClone wasn't
alone in feeling confident in anticipating FDA Approval, as
Bristol-Myers Squibb (New York, NY) (NYSE:BMY) invested $1 billion in
September of 2001 to secure the drug's U.S. marketing rights.
	   Since then, the FDA announced on December 28, 2001 that they were
rejecting ImClone's Erbitux application, judging the documentation
insufficient to properly review the drug, ImClone's shares have fallen
drastically from a high of $75.00 on December 6, 2001 to $17.00 on
January 18, 2002. The question is, did ImClone attempt to hedge their
bet by cutting corners during clinical trials?
	   ImClone is struggling to survive, battling lawsuits from irate
investors, and facing a congressional investigation into allegations
that the company deceived those investors. Their newly expanded plant
has been idled. If forced to undergo new trials, Erbitux may not be
available for months, if ever.
	   Amgen is riding the wave of success with a second drug, the
rheumatoid arthritis therapy Kineret, which recently received FDA
Approval. They have announced future plans to expand the Longmont site
to 4 million square feet, an expenditure that could reach
$500,000,000.
	   "If ImClone is ultimately found not to have played by the rules,
then their gamble will prove to be a costly one, both in dollars and
the loss of a potential life saving drug," notes Annette Kreuger,
Industry Manager of Pharmaceutical-Biotech at Industrialinfo.com.
"Amgen played their cards right."

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Dredging Angolan Diamonds Beats Rain
Season Hazard, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--October 24, 2001--The following is an advisory by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc., Houston,
Texas). When licensing and share details of the Canadian company
SouthernEra have been finalized between the Angolan government and the
mining partners by March 2002, work will be able to proceed on the
Camafuca diamond project which has a diamond bearing kimberlite pipe
with a surface area of 167 hectares. Time and the rainy season are
crucial factors in the venture as the exposed part of the pipe can
initially be exploited by bulk-sampling whereas when the rainy season
hits the 80m wide Chicapa river floods over the area.
	   SouthernEra will use barge mounted dredges fitted with cutting
heads to recover the 23.2m carats worth $2.3 billion. This innovative
technique surmounts the natural obstacles, which have hitherto
prevented the exploitation of the pipe. The Israeli company Welox is
providing funding up to $20 million and will hold 33% of the joint
venture. Endiama, the Angolan government diamond corporation, will
hold 20%. SML, which is a combination of the Portuguese SPE and
Endiama, will take 15% and SouthernEra 32%.

Await Final Permit for Cogen Unit, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

	   Business Editors & Energy Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 24, 2001--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc.; Houston,
Texas). American Electric Power (NYSE:AEP) (Columbus, Ohio) and
development partner The Dow Chemical Company (NYSE:DOW) (Midland, MI)
are expecting final permit approval in November for the construction
of a 900 mega-watt (MW) $325 million cogeneration unit to be

	   AEP plans to begin construction during December of 2001 utilizing
their subsidiary AEP Pro Serv, Incorporated (Columbus, OH) for
engineering design on the project that is scheduled to take 22 months
to complete. A short list of two general contractors has also been
identified.
	   The natural gas-fired unit will be configured with four General
Electric 7FA combustion turbines and a nominal 200MW Alsthom stream
turbine with a heat recovery steam generator to produce electricity
and process steam for the Dow complex. A 20-year power sales agreement
is also in place with Tractebel Energy Marketing Inc. a subsidiary of
Belgian company Tractebel S.A.
	   Paul Addis, executive vice president for AEP adds, "This new
facility will bring generating capacity to Louisiana using
environmentally-friendly and energy-efficient technology, while at the
same time allowing Dow to achieve greater energy efficiency in its
core business."

Hi Paul,
I have attached the new estimates below, with rolling in all costs you are
saving about $100 per month including the first and second mortgages,
which is substantial.   At this point you probably have quite a bit in your
escrow account, tax bills go out November 1 and insurance is due October 1.
If you reduce your loan amount by these amounts and pay for them at closing
out of pocket you will reduce it even more.  The catch is that you won't
receive this money back from your current until probably 5 weeks after
closing.  It's up to you whether you want to "pocket" that money by having
rolled it into the loan amount or reimburse the out of pocket money from
this closing by not having rolled it into the loan amount.  It can be
confusing so let me know if you have any questions.

*****Reminder Notice************

Dear Market Participants

On October 17, 2001, the NYISO web servers will be upgraded.  This will
require both software and hardware changes.  While these changes will be
transparent to the users, these changes will require that the MIS system
be unavailable for approximately 60 minutes.  The outage will begin at
approximately 11:35 AM.  Market Participants planning on submitting
HAM transactions or modifying Day Ahead bids should act accordingly.

The NYISO will minimize the duration of the outage as much as possible
as we recognize the inconvenience caused by system outages.  Ultimately,
these changes will result in a more stable environment and provide enhanced
services that the current web servers are unable to perform.

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
Representative or the Help Desk at (518) 356-6060.

Thank You
Customer Relations

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) TVA Starts Construction of the Nation's
First Energy Storage Plant, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

	   Business Editors & Energy Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 24, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc;
Houston, Texas). The Tennessee Valley Authority (NYSE:TVB)(NYSE:TVC)
recently started construction of the nation's first large scale power
storage facility at a two acre site off of Highway 373 just east of
the Air Force Base near Columbus, MS. Construction of the $25 million
facility is expected to take 18-24 months to complete, creating
roughly 60 jobs before the project is finished in 2003. "This
innovative energy-storage plant is designed to improve power
reliability and customer service, have limited environmental impact
and contribute to economic growth for consumers in Mississippi and
throughout the Tennessee Valley," says TVA Chairman Glenn McCullough
Jr. "TVA continues to set the pace for energy production and
demonstrate its role as a national leader in the use of cutting-edge,
21st-Century technologies."
	   The plant was designed by Regenesys Technologies Limited, part of
Innogy plc (UK) and utilizes regenerative fuel cell technology. During
periods of low electrical demand the cells are charged with
electricity generated at other locations. The stored energy is then
released during times of demand. The power storage facility is
designed to store up to 120 megawatt-hours of energy and will be
capable of providing power to 7,500 homes for up to 10 hours. "This
will be the first use of the Regenesys technology in the United
States," said Regenesys Technology Chief Executive Officer Andrew
Duff. Rengenesys and Innogy are currently building a similar plant in
the United Kingdom scheduled for completion in 2002.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
and industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming
construction activities in the Energy Markets as well as other
industrial sectors send inquiries to powergroup@industrialinfo.com or

The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 07:00 and 16:00 in the January 22,
2002 Real-Time Market.

In addition, the NYISO is reserving hours beginning 0:00 through 6:00
in the Hour-Ahead locational reserve market.

Prices in the January 23, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Pipe Link Through Algeria Could Bring
Nigerian Gas to Europe, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 7, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources
Incorporated, Houston, Texas). Nigeria and Algeria have signed a
memorandum of understanding, which could see Nigerian gas being
exported to Europe by pipeline. The pipeline construction studies to
be undertaken between the two countries will look at a route from
southern Nigeria, through Abuja and across Niger and the Sahara Desert
to Beni Saf on Algeria's Mediterranean coast. Beni Saf is planned as
the terminus for the proposed pipeline between Algeria and Spain.
	   The original project to build a pipeline around the West African
coast to Algeria did not progress, although it spawned the West Africa
Gas Pipeline between Ghana, Nigeria, Togo and Benin, which is now
scheduled for construction.
	   The new plan will need 4,000 kms of pipe laying at a cost
estimated between $5 and $7 billion and would see Nigerian gas flowing
through the new line to Spain and the existing line to Italy.
	   In the wake of the Enron debacle, Nigeria LNG, Italy's ENI, and
Spain's Iberdrola are looking at the gap which will occur for the
Bonny liquefied gas complex if the US company's intention to buy 4
billion cubic meters a year has evaporated. This could motivate action
plans for the new pipeline. So far, the Spanish have signed for 1.5
billion cubic meters and the Italians 1 billion cubic meters of gas
and February 2002 is the scheduled decision time on whether to go
ahead with production from the planned fourth and fifth trains at the
Bonny complex.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
and industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming
construction activities for the Oil & Gas Transmission markets as well

million 468 mega-watt (MW) energy center to be located in Elgin,
Illinois. AmerenEnergy is an operator of more than 3,500MW of
generating capacity.
	   Construction began in November of 2001 for The Elgin Energy
Center, located on 1559 Gifford Road near the intersection of Gifford
and Spaulding Roads in Cook County and completion is expected in the
fall of 2002.
	   Sargent & Lundy (Chicago, Ill.) was selected to provide
engineering services and Fru-Con Construction Corporation (Ballwin,
Mo.) was selected as the overall general contractor to construct the
new power station.
	   The facility will use four simple-cycle natural gas fired
turbines, which will produce up to 468MW of peak load electricity. The
turbines will have the capability to be operated with wet compression
if needed for power augmentation following achievement of normal full
load power output. Wet Compression entails introduction of water into
the inlet air duct and evaporation of the water in the compressor.
	   Ameren Corporation (NYSE: AEE) provides electric and gas services
to customers in Missouri and Illinois through its subsidiaries,
AmerenCIPS, AmerenUE, and AmerenEnergy Generating Company.
	   Ameren has $9 billion in assets, almost $6 billion in market
capitalization and $3.5 billion in total revenues. Ameren companies'
net generating capacity is nearly 12,000MW with a total of 14
base-load and hydroelectric plants, currently employing over 7,300
people.

Subject: RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Congestion Management Panel



 RTO Week

Day 2 -- October 16, 2001

Congestion Management and Transmission Rights

The morning panel discussion was on congestion management.  The panelists w=
ere:  Nancy Brockway, Commissioner New Hampshire PSC; Reem Fahey, Edison Mi=
ssion; Carol Guthrie, Chevron/Texaco; Shmuel Oren, University of California=
 - Berkley and advises Texas PUC; Andy Ott, PJM; Michael Schnitzer, NorthBr=
idge Group.

General Observations

The Commissioners were again all present (Wood left mid-morning to give tes=
timony on Capitol Hill).  Today, however, FERC Staff was much more active i=
n the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions.  The topic=
s are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are be=
ing rehashed again.  This will probably continue for the rest of the week. =
 What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support =
for some of the basic concepts, most notably the need for a real time energ=
y market based using LMP.  Very few panelists have opposed this; at most, a=
 couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be st=
andardized -- basically conceding that PJM's system will be implemented in =
the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else.   =20

Locational Marginal Pricing

The panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary (Sch=
muel Oren does not oppose it).  Most of the panelists think this needs to b=
e standardized across RTOs.  Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem =
and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized.   Car=
ol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize=
 the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect.  She said FERC should =
try a couple of different systems and see what works. =20

FTRs versus Flowgates

The panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial, not phys=
ical.  Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be h=
is preference - unclear.  Most of the panelists, including the PSC commissi=
oner, prefer FTRs rather than flowgates.  Schmuel is a flowgate advocate.  =
After some discussion, the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could w=
ork together, provided that the definition of flowgate is understood.  Andy=
 Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates=
 is the same purpose of having hubs (liquidity, standard product), and if a=
 flowgate is defined as a grouping of point-to-point rights, then FTRs and =
flowgates can coexist.  If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights, it'=
s okay.  However, if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring s=
cheduling, the two cannot coexist.  Schmuel seemed to agree with this premi=
se, although this is not his preference.  He seems to prefer only flowgates=
 without FTRs.   Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fe=
ar that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs.

The panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or fl=
owgates should be allocated to load, but the method of allocation was not a=
greed upon.

FERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgate=
s.  Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitu=
tes a commercially significant flowgate, and what happens when circumstance=
s change over time, resulting in different flowgates being commercially sig=
nificant.  Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on c=
ommercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates, but if pa=
rticipants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedg=
ed, use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable. =20

The panelists agreed that these financial rights (either FTRs or flowgates)=
 should be tradable in the secondary market.  The panelists disagreed on wh=
ich instrument -- FTRs or flowgates -- are more tradable.  Andy thinks FTRs=
 are more tradable; Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable.

Options versus Obligations

The panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also dis=
cussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are=
 only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does =
not flow.  Andy Ott said options will most likely result in fewer FTRs bein=
g allocated.  Schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front. =20

The afternoon panel was on Transmission Planning and Expansion.  Steve Walt=
on was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly=
. =20

Let me know if you have any questions.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) King's Hawaiian Bakery Says Aloha to New
Bakery Site, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors & Food Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 23, 2002--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Incorporated;
Houston, Texas). King's Hawaiian Bakery (Torrance, Calif.), a
privately held company, has broken ground and has begun preparing the
site in Torrance, California for a new $28 million bread bakery.
	   King's Hawaiian has been in Torrance since 1977 but has since
outgrown its existing bakery operation and plans to relocate to the
new and expanded bakery by the end of the year.
	   Under the direction of leading food industry architects and
engineers Webber/Smith Associates (Lancaster, Pa.), the new 130,000
square foot bakery will be outfitted with state-of-the-art automated
baking ovens and packaging equipment and two 6,000 pound per hour
bread baking lines. Products that will be produced at the plant
include King's Hawaiian famous sweet bread and multigrain bread plus
dinner and sweet rolls. The bakery has been in the planning stages for
over two years.
	   In 1955, Robert Tiara founded the company, which had its first
operation in Hilo, Hawaii. Realizing the potential for his round loaf
bread in the states, he built and relocated the company to the
mainland in Torrance, California in 1977 and has been baking bread at
that location ever since. The new plant represents the largest
investment ever made by the company.

Joe Kirkpatrick wrote:

On a side note it is interesting to note that there is a recent
presentation
to the AMP/ICM Task Force by one of the participants that has determined
that if all the large suppliers collude in tandem to withhold 50 MW each
that there could conceivably be an increase in price. While this
conspiracy
theory is of concern to said presenter it would seem highly unlikely,
especially considering that bid load or exports provide a much higher
impact
on price in reality than the unlikely scenario of some large suppliers all
colluding in tandem.


My comment:

This is a serious mischaracterization of what was said.   No collusion is
required.  All that is needed for a large impact on prices from the
exercise of market power is for the generators to act in their own self
interest.

Subject:	New from FriedWire...


Good morning to all of you at Enron.
 
I wanted to make you all aware of two major new capabilities that FriedWire is soon to deploy.  One will be the new PJM intelligence module that will be an add-on to the existing Traffic Report.  The other is a brand new version of the Traffic Report itself that incorporates real-time electricity prices and news/commentary from THE major provider of this content.  FriedWire will be making some announcements shortly describing the strategic alliance between our firm and this content partner, and should be able to start showing the enhanced, jointly developed version of the Traffic Report in October.
 
Regarding the PJM module; we are now scheduling 30-40 minute, remote (Internet-based) overviews with clients who actively trade in PJM.  These will begin the week of September 24th.  If any of you or your colleagues would like to participate in a very informal session that looks at the capabilities of this new tool, please contact me and I can help set-up a date and time.  Some of the content and functionality in the PJM module includes:
 
}         Real time price and loadcharts that present current conditions in historical context
}         Real-time and day-ahead LMP data along with the public FTR data to provide a real-time estimate of FTR value
}         Easy interface for querying FTR data to provide competitive intelligence in the primary and secondary FTR markets
}         Tools for valuing FTRs in the monthly FTR auction
}         PJM load charts displaying PJM ISO load forecast bias
}         Eastern Interconnect frequency monitoring
}         LMP charts and maps
}         Customizable displays in the form of personalized Watchlists, tables and chart building tools
 
Thanks and contact me with anything you might need.
 
Take Care, 
 
Stuart Wright
Director
FriedWire Inc.

The NYISO has been experiencing difficulties in posting price reservations
to the TIE.  The postings have from time to time been extraordinarily
delayed.  Our internal process identifies such delays in enough time so
that we can generate another posting by COB of the appropriate day.
Several times the originally delayed posting has shown up on the TIE as
well, resulting in dual postings.  The NYISO apologizes for any confusion.
The NYISO notes that the price reservations are also posted to the OASIS,
and that there have been no problems in tghe latter process.

Dear Market Participants

1st Rochdale Cooperative. Ltd. is being removed from the
NYISO-administered electric energy markets.  The changeover
of 1st Rochdale's customers to the provider of last resort,
Consolidated Edison Company of New York, will take place on
Friday, October 12 for the Saturday, October 13th market.
1st Rochdale had previously posted a sufficient amount of
collateral to cover its obligations to the energy market and
the NYISO anticipates, therefore, that no losses associated
with this transition will be borne by the market.

Regards,
Customer Relations

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

As you are all aware, Enron and UBS have entered into an agreement for the sale of certain assets of the wholesale gas and power trading organization.  As part of that agreement, the management of UBS may speak to you over the next several days about an opportunity in that new organization.  If so, we encourage you to consider such an offer. However, if you are not employed by UBS, you remain an Enron employee.  If you have specific questions regarding your employment arrangements and job responsibilities please contact Anne Labbe in Human Resources at 5-7809, or feel free to contact either Jim Fallon or Dave Delainey directly.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) U.S. Forest Products Industry Shows
Signs of Getting Out of the Woods in Late 2002, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 20, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc;
Houston). The year ahead will be challenging for America's forest
products industry, much like 2001. Weak demand for some products
combined with a sluggish economy will continue to plague the industry
through most of 2002. Getting out of the "woods" will be determined by
how well manufacturers match production to demand, more industry
consolidation and by limiting capital spending.
	   Capacity expansion is mostly non-existent and growth will be less
than 1%, as plants will still have to contend with production
curtailments through the first half of 2002. Producers have indicated
that machines will no longer run outright, but instead run closer to
demand. By the third quarter of next year, producers expect to see a
significant reduction in high inventories that could trigger long
awaited price increases.
	   Industry consolidation has become necessary for growth as well as
a way to survive in a global marketplace. More mergers and
acquisitions are in line for the industry next year. In the midst of
shuffling manufacturing assets, business groups and marketing
strategies, more of the country's plants will close permanently.
Additionally, consolidation will lead to some U.S. plants falling into
the hands of foreign companies. For some plants, new ownership could
mean an injection of much needed capital investments.
	   Industrial Information Resources recently published 2002
Industrial Outlook (http://www.industrialinfo.com/indoutlook.htm),
available on CD-ROM, projects a whopping 20% decline in capital
spending compared to 2001. Though seemingly dismal, spending will be
sustained by environmental projects, the need to replace aging
equipment and by investments that yield high returns in the short
term.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
and industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming

In a train carriage there was Bill Clinton, George Bush, Janet Reno and Bo
Derek. After several minutes of the trip, the train passes through a dark tunnel
and the unmistakable sound of a slap is heard.

>      When they leave the tunnel, Clinton has a big red slap mark on his cheek.

>      (1) Bo Derek thought - "That sleazeball Clinton wanted to touch me and by
mistake, he must have                         put his hand on Janet Reno, who in
turn must have slapped his face."

Derek and she smacked                                 him."

The NYISO is reserving hours beginning 08:00, 10:00, 17:00, 18:00, and
20:00 in the January 21, 2002 Real-Time Market as well as hour beginning
08:00 at all external locations.

In addition, the NYISO is reserving hours beginning 19:00, 20:00, and 23:00
in the Hour-Ahead locational reserve market.

Prices in the January 22, 2002 Day-Ahead Market are correct.

Please note that Market Monitoring will no longer be reserving prices due
to ECA-B.  Code modifications were made on December 20th to incorporate
into the Real-Time price, the BME price in the presence of congestion.  The
incorporation is now an automatic process that is prescribed by the NYISO
tariffs.  This message will appear in price reservation announcements
through January 31, 2002.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Sasol Launches Olefin Crackers In
Malaysia For Asian Markets, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 10, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources
Incorporated, Houston). Two petrohemical projects worth $100 million
are now being launched in Malaysia by Sasol, the South African
petrochemicals and synfuels company. The first plant going on stream
at Kernith is a cracker for the production of ethylene and propylene
from natural gas. It will produce 600,000 tons of ethylene and 85,000
tons of propylene per annum. Sasol has a 12% interest in this plant,
with Malaysia's Petronas taking 64% and the U.S. company Dow 24%.
	   The adjacent plant at Petilin will produce 255,000 tons of
low-density polyethylene a year and will service markets in China,
Taiwan, other Asian countries and Africa. Sasol has a 40% share in
this plant with Petronas 40% and DSM from Holland 20%.
	   The two plants will increase Sasol's production of polyethylene by
50%. Sasol will use its 10% interest in Wesco, a distributor of
polymer products in China and Taiwan, to access Asian markets for its
Malaysian output.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
and industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming

Joel

My apologies if I mischaracterized the presentation, I simply interpreted
this excerpt from the PSC presentation..

As can be seen from the spreadsheet, no single
supplier, withholding 50 MW, can, on its own, cause the price to rise by the
$100
needed to breach the AMP's $100 price impact threshold. But, if a number of
large players, each acting unilaterally, withhold 50 MW due to the
profitability of
doing so, the combined effect on price could be over $100, which would be
both
very damaging to buyers, and very profitable to suppliers.

In my simple interpretation of the NYISO Market Monitoring Plan it is a
measure of conduct and impact.

As follows from the Market Monitoring Plan..

2.1

Conduct Subject to Mitigation

Mitigation Measures may be applied: (i) to the bidding, scheduling or
operation of an "Electric
Facility," defined for purposes of this Addendum to the Plan as an electric
generation resource or
transmission facility; or (ii) as specified in ? 2.3(b)).
2.3. Categories of Conduct that May Warrant Mitigation

a) The following categories of conduct, whether by a single firm or by
multiple firms acting
in concert, may cause a material effect on prices or guarantee payments in a
New York Electric Market
if exercised from a position of market power. Accordingly, the NYISO shall
monitor the New York
Electric Markets for the following categories of conduct, and shall impose
appropriate Mitigation
Measures if such conduct is detected and the other applicable conditions for
the imposition of Mitigation.


You state that one generator witholding 50 MW does not warrant mitigation
but a number of firms acting "unilaterally" would have an impact and should
be mitigated. The NYISO however according to section 2.3 (in my
interpretation of the Plan) a witholding of 50 MW (using your MW value) by
multiple firms cannot be market power if they are not acting in concert. You
admit that they are acting unilaterally and not acting in concert. If that
is the case the only way these firms should be mitigated is if they are
colluding or acting in concert.

Potentially splitting hairs here and I have no intention of swapping
interpretations of the Market Monitoring Plan when it is clearly the
function of the NYISO market Monitoring Unit, but what is the PSC's position
on one market participant trying to export 500 or 1000 MW to multiple export
points out of the NYISO; will this not have an impact on price, is this
market power because prices may go up?
Hopefully market power is not defined by high prices but by conduct as
defined in the Plan.

Regards..

Joe

Joe Kirkpatrick wrote:

On a side note it is interesting to note that there is a recent
presentation
to the AMP/ICM Task Force by one of the participants that has determined
that if all the large suppliers collude in tandem to withhold 50 MW each
that there could conceivably be an increase in price. While this
conspiracy
theory is of concern to said presenter it would seem highly unlikely,
especially considering that bid load or exports provide a much higher
impact
on price in reality than the unlikely scenario of some large suppliers all
colluding in tandem.


My comment:

This is a serious mischaracterization of what was said.   No collusion is
required.  All that is needed for a large impact on prices from the
exercise of market power is for the generators to act in their own self
interest.

market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants:

Billing Data Dictionary Version 15 will become effective for
November 2001 billing dates forward and will supercede Version 14.
Version 15 includes provisions for billing codes associated with
Virtual Bidding.  New sections have been added to both the hourly
and daily advisory statements to accomodate the Virtual Market
settlement billing codes.  A new billing code has also been added
to the Ancillary Services section of the daily advisory statement
to report incremental uplift due to under-forecasting.

The new dictionary will be posted at:
http://www.nyiso.com/markets/billing.html#datadict

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
Representative or the Help Desk at 518.356.6060.

Regards,

Customer Relations

The NYISO requires additional time to reconcile settlement balances for the
January 2000 2nd settlement adjustment.  As a result, issuances of invoices
for the January 2000 2nd settlement adjustment are being delayed.  It is
anticipated that invoices for the January 2000 2nd settlement adjustment
will be posted by 23:00, Monday, October 15, 2001.  The NYISO apologizes
for any inconveniences caused by this delay.

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Dynegy Sets Commissioning of 1,010 MW of
New ECAR Region Power for 2nd Quarter 2002, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 18, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, Texas). Dynegy Incorporated (NYSE:DYN) (Houston) is underway
with the construction of two new power plants that will bring 1,010
mega-watts (MW) into service during the 2nd quarter of 2002 in the
ECAR (East Central Area Reliability) region.
	   The larger of the two projects, the $150 million, 680MW
Renaissance Power Plant, will be located in Carson City, Mich., on a
30-acre track of land north of Highway 57 on property that was
originally developed by Decker Energy International back in June of
2000. The natural gas-fired plant will utilize four Westinghouse model
501F combustion turbines and will tie into Consumers Energy's
transmission system through a 2-mile interconnection line. Gas
connections will be provided by a 9.2-mile pipeline from Michigan
Consolidated Gas Company.
	   The second project, Foothills Generation Station, is adjacent to
Dynegy's 500MW Riverside Generation, located near Louisa, Ky., that
began commercial operation in June 2001. This $100 million natural
gas-fired simple-cycle peaking plant consists of two Siemens
Westinghouse 501F combustion turbines and brings an additional 330MW
to the grid. American Electric Power will provide transmission
interconnects and fuel will be provided by Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Company.
	   When Renaissance and Foothills come online along with Riverside,
Dynegy will have added approximately 1,510MW to the ECAR region by 2nd
Quarter 2002. Steve Bergstrom, president and chief operating officer
of Dynegy added, "These power projects will contribute significantly
to the financial base of the communities, providing for expanded
community services that will directly or indirectly benefit local
residents. These projects also will contribute to the county's goal of
continued growth and development, as well as provide much needed
capacity to help enhance electric service reliability in the areas."
	   Dynegy is a leading provider of energy and communications
solutions to customers in North America, the United Kingdom and
Continental Europe. Their position extends across the entire
convergence value chain, including power generation and wholesale and
direct commercial and industrial marketing and trading of power,
natural gas and coal. They are also involved in the transportation,
gathering and processing of natural gas liquids and the transmission
and distribution of electricity and natural gas to retail consumers.

market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
and industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming
construction activities for the energy and power markets as well as

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Sithe Energies Plans Over $3 Billion in
New Power Generation in the U.S. and Canada, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 10, 2002--Researched by
Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc, Houston).
Sithe Energies Incorporated (New York), a Private Energy Producer
(PEP), is investing over $3 billion in new power generation for the
United States and Canada. There are six plants in various stages of
development totaling 3,700MW and five facilities under construction
with over 2,600MW of new power generation scheduled to come online
through 2005.
	   Sithe Energies currently has an 800MW plant under construction in
North Weymouth, Mass., which is expected to come on line later this
year. A proposed project in Rockland County, N.Y., referred to as
"Ramapo" has recently been cancelled due to unfavorable market
conditions.
	   Sithe owns, develops and operates power generation facilities in
North America, Canada and internationally. In North America, Sithe
currently owns and operates 27 power plants producing approximately
3,800MW and expects to increase the number of operational power
generating facilities to over 38 by 2005.
	   Sithe Energies was founded in 1984 and is one of the top five
PEP's in the world. Exelon Corporation (NYSE:EXC)(Chicago) currently
owns 49.9% of Sithe Energies and over the next 5 years, may have the
option to purchase the remaining 50.1%. Exelon was formed in October
of 2000 from the merger of PECO (NYSE:PE)(Philadelphia) and Unicom
(Chicago). With over $15 billion in annual revenues and serving over 5
million customers, Exelon has become the nation's largest unregulated
supplier of natural gas and electricity
	   Although more than 70 percent of Exelon's 19,000MW generating
capacity comes from nuclear plants, Sithe Energies North American
facilities consist primarily of fossil and hydro power generation.

-----------------------------------------------------

Dear NYTimes.com Member,

One of the most meaningful features to appear in The New
York Times and on NYTimes.com is Portraits of Grief. This
feature first began running on September 15 and presented
brief profiles of World Trade Center victims. On December
31 the final daily edition of Portraits of Grief appeared
in The New York Times newspaper. A book will be published
this year, and the feature will continue to appear from
time to time, as more names become known and more families
agree to interviews.

In the meantime, we invite you to visit the Web site to
see a complete collection of Portraits of Grief,
alphabetized and listed by day. This archive represents
all the Portraits published to date. They will remain at
NYTimes.com indefinitely.

Another recent special feature has been the multimedia
photo essay. We have already talked here about the essays
done by Vincent Laforet and James Hill. I would now like
to direct your attention to the newest, this one by Times
staff photographer Ruth Fremson about the women in
Afghanistan. The essay features a very strong audio
commentary, which makes the point that not all the women
feel the same about the head-to-toe veil they were
required to wear under the Taliban's rule: in fact, many
are very comfortable dressed as they are.

http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/dayofterror/index.html?rd=hcmcp?p=041_Dk041_FO44Ib1012000mxZkHxZo$

We have enjoyed participating in almost daily
"conversations" with correspondents of The New York Times.
In these unstructured talks, each correspondent provides
information not only about the news he or she is covering,
but on what life is like in the particular place he or she
is located. There are over 50 discussions now available
for listening in audio format.

The Winter Olympics games at Salt Lake City begin soon and
NYTimes.com already has started covering this event. Our
Olympics section covers security concerns, athlete
profiles and an interactive map of the torch relay.
Special e-mail updates are now available, and include
periodic countdown reports and details of the torch run,
athlete profiles and event previews. When the games begin
on Feb. 8, we'll send daily dispatches with event results
and exclusive "postcards" from Salt Lake City by Times
sports reporter George Vecsey.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) New Capacity for the Polypropylene
Market Could Arrive in the Second Quarter of 2002, in an Advisory by
Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 22, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources,
Incorporated; Houston, Texas). Polypropylene (PP) has enjoyed a growth
of over 6% annually until the year 2000 and its future growth is only
expected to slow slightly. Polypropylene's diversity in end uses has
helped sustain its growth through a very slow 2001 industrial spending
year and estimates indicate growth for the next two years will be
approximately 4% annually despite a rapidly slowing economy.
	   Polypropylene has a high tensile strength and excellent chemical
resistance properties that make it attractive for both industrial and
consumer products such as fibers, films, compounded plastics and
packaging materials. These qualities and markets supported several
years of bullish pricing and strong demand. Capacity increases over
the last two years such as new unit additions by both ExxonMobil and
Dow has brought nearly 1.2 billion pounds per year of new capacity to
the market and translated that into reduced operating rates for some
producers as capacity slowly crept past demand.
	   Additional capacity is planned to come online in the second
quarter of 2002 when Phillips Petroleum begins operations of its new
775 million pound per year unit at its Bayway refinery in Linden, New
Jersey using UNIPOL technology.
	   2002 will likely result in lower profit margins for most PP
producers, but its diversity and a good supply of polymer grade
propylene feedstocks will help it remain in a position of growth.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
and industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming
construction activities in the Chemical markets as well as other
industrial sectors send inquiries to chemicalgroup@industrialinfo.com

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Huaneng Power International Announces
Plans for the Future, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

	   Business Editors & Energy Writers

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 22, 2001--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, Texas). Huaneng Power International, Incorporated (Beijing,
China) has announced its tenth five-year plan to be coordinated with
the construction of the China west-east natural gas pipeline. This
4,167 kilometers (2,604 miles) pipeline is still in the developmental
stages and is expected to start construction in the second half of
next year.
	   Huaneng Power plans the construction of two advanced combined
cycle gas turbine power plants in Jinling and Shanghai with a capacity
of 1,200 mega-watts (MW) each. It also has plans to continue to
develop large-scale mine-mouth coal-fired power plants adjacent to
coal mines with major road infrastructure in place. In addition to the
completion of the 1,320MW coal-fired Dezhou power plant, the company
also plans to expand its Shangan power plant with two 600MW coal-fired
units. If these projects are developed the power generated would be
4,920MW at a total cost of $3.2 billion, and it would raise Huaneng
Power's total generation capacity from its current 10,813MW up to
15,7335MW.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Alaska: America's Last Oil and Gas
Reserve, in an Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 18, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources
Incorporated; Houston). When Secretary of State William Seward
purchased Alaska from Russia on March 30, 1867 for $7.2 million, his
goal was to increase the United States' (U.S.) landmass. In reality
"Seward's Folly" has arguably turned out to be, the single best deal
the U.S. government has ever completed. While Alaska does cover over
656,000 sq miles, its greatest contribution to the U.S. has been, and
will continue to be, its natural resources.
	   The first major oil reserve in Alaska was first discovered in 1968
in Prudhoe Bay. Soon thereafter, construction of the Trans-Alaska
Pipeline kicked off in 1974 and by 1977 oil was being transported 800
miles south to Valdez, Alaska. Today, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline
transports 20% of the annual U.S. oil production.
	   With the discovery of the oil and natural gas reserves on the
North Slope, Alaska was thrust into the limelight of the U.S. energy
industry. Alaska boasts over 9 billion barrels of oil reserves yet to
be recovered. In addition, Alaska has the potential to recover 4
billion barrels of liquid natural gas and up to 65 trillion cubic feet
of raw natural gas. With the traditional oil and gas reserves in the
lower 48 states slowly depleting, Alaska remains the best hope to meet
the fuel needs of the U.S. energy industry in the future.
	   Having resources of this magnitude provides the state of Alaska
with numerous capital opportunities. Over $38 billion will be spent in
Alaska developing, processing and transporting the oil and gas
reserves in the next few years. New finds will be developed and
existing finds will be expanded as the industry seeks to develop the
natural resources to their utmost. Companies such as Phillips Alaska,
ARCO Alaska, BP Canada Energy, Foothills Pipeline, Yukon Pacific and
Arctic Resources are developing the oil and gas reserves at a feverish
pace.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including industry alerts and databases for the energy
and industrial markets. For more information on trends and upcoming
construction activities for the oil and gas markets as well as other
industrial sectors send inquiries to energygroup@industrialinfo.com
or visit us at www.industrialinfo.com and www.iirenergy.com.
