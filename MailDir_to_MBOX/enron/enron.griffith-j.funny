<!--StartFragment-->When Santa Runs Out Of Prozac
Dear  Santa,
I've written you for three years now asking for a fire truck.  
Please, I really really want a fire truck this year! 
Love,  Joey
Dear Joey,
Let me make it up to you. Christmas Eve, while you  sleep, I'm 
gonna torch your house.  You'll have more fire trucks than  you'll 
know what to do with.
- Santa
Dear Santa,
I  don't know if you can do this, but for Christmas, I'd like for 
my mommy and  daddy to get back together. Please see what you can 
do. 
Love,  Teddy
Dear Teddy,
What, and ruin that hot affair your dad's still  having with the
babysitter?  He's banging her like a screen door in a  hurricane, 
son!  Let me get you some nice Legos instead. 
-  Santa
Dear Santa,
I left milk and cookies for you under the tree,  and I left carrots
or your reindeer outside the backdoor. 
Love,  Susan
Dear Susan,
Milk gives me the shits and carrots make the deer  fart in my face.
You want to be a kiss-ass? Leave me a glass of Chivas Regal  and 
some Toblerone.
-Santa
Dear Santa,
I really really  want a puppy this year. Please please please PLEASE
-  Jimmy
Jimmy,
That whiney-begging shit may work with your folks, but  that crap
don't work up here. You're getting a sweater again. 
-  Santa
Dear Santa,
What do you do the other 364 days of the  year? Are you making toys?
Your friend, Thomas
Dear Thomas,
All  toys get made in China. I have a condo in Vegas, where I spend
most my time  squeezing cocktail waitresses asses, and losing all 
my cash at the craps  table. Hey, YOU wanted to know! 
- Santa
Dear Santa,
I wud  like a kool toy space ranjur for Xmas. Iv ben a good boy all
yeer.
YeR  FReND, BiLLy
Dear Billy,
Nice spelling. You're on your way to being a  career lawncare 
specialist.  How 'bout I send you a fucking book so you  can learn
to read and write?  I'm giving your older brother the space  
ranger, at least HE can spell!
-Santa
Dear Santa,
I  have been a good girl all year, and the only thing I ask for is
peace and joy  in the world for everybody!  
Love, Sarah
Dear Sarah,
Your  parents smoked pot when they had you, didn't they? 
-  Santa
Dear Santa,
I need more Pokemon cards please! All my  friends have more Pokemon
cards than me. Please see what you can do.   
Love, Michelle
Dear Michelle,
It blows my fucking mind. Kids are  forcing their parents to buy 
hundreds of dollars worth of these stupid  cards, and none of you 
snot-nosed brats are even learning to play the game.  Let me get 
you something more your speed, like "Chutes and Ladders." 
-  Santa
Dear Santa,
I want a new bike, playstation, a train,  some G.I. Joes, a dog, 
a drum kit, a pony and a tuba. 
Love,  Francis
Dear Francis,
Who the fuck names their kid "Francis" nowadays?  
- Santa
Dear Santa,
Do you see us when we're sleeping, do  you really know when we're
awake, like in the song?  
Love,  Jessica
Dear Jessica,
You are that gullible? Good luck in whatever you  do, I'm skipping 
your house... 
- Santa
Dearest  Santa,
We don't have a chimney in our house, how do you get into our  home?
Love, Marky
Mark,
Firstly, stop calling yourself "Marky";  that's why you're getting
your ass whipped at school. Secondly, you don't  live in a house, 
that's a low-rent apartment complex you're living in.  Thirdly, I 
get inside your pad just like all the burglars do, through your  
bedroom window. Sweet Dreams! 
-  Santa

WAIT TRAINING

Perhaps you can relate. One man was to meet his wife downtown and
spend some time shopping with her. He waited patiently for 15
minutes. Then he waited impatiently for 15 minutes more.

After that, he became angry. Seeing one of those photograph
booths nearby (the kind that accepts coins into a slot and takes
four shots while you pose on a small bench), he had an idea. He
assumed the most ferocious expression he could manage, which
wasn't difficult under the circumstances, and in a few moments he
was holding four small prints that shocked even him!

He wrote his wife's name on the back of the photographs and
handed them to a clerk behind the desk. "If you see a small, dark
lady with brown eyes and an apologetic expression, apparently
looking for someone, would you please give her this?" he said.

He then returned to his office content that, if a picture is
worth a thousand words, then four photos must be a full-blown
lecture!

His wife saved those pictures. She carries them in her purse now.
Shows them to anyone who asks if she is married..

How are you with patience? One person calls it "wait-training."
It seems that there is always something we are waiting for. We
wait on traffic and we wait in lines. We wait to hear about a new
job. We wait to complete school or to retire. We wait to grow up
or for maturity in a child. We wait for a decision to be made. We
wait for someone to change his or her mind.

Patience is an essential quality of a happy life. After all, some
things are worth waiting for. Every day presents plenty of
opportunities for wait training.

 We can resent waiting, accept it or even get good at it! But one
thing is certain - we cannot avoid it. How is your wait training
coming along?

Hello friends. I'm engaged in yet another bizarre art event. I hope 
to see you there. Details below >>>
00> Cockfight Arena <00
C-level, Chinatown Los Angeles
Saturday Nov. 10th
7pm - 11pm
The creators of Tekken Torture Tournament are proud to bring you 
Cockfight Arena. A one night parade of sweat and adrenaline pitting 
viewer against viewer in brutal virtual cockfighting theatre. After 
entering our dimly lit basement space, audience volunteers will don 
custom-made wireless game controllers with full sized wings and 
feathered helmets. Combatants will step into an arena to control 
their life size game avatars through vigorous flapping and pecking, 
competing for blood and birdfeed while rapaciously inflicting 
onscreen bodily harm.
:::
Cockfight Arena is free and open to the public. Gambling and smoking 
will be permitted. No animals or humans were injured in the 
production of this event.
:::
C-level is a cooperative public and private lab formed to share 
physical, social and technological resources. Its members are 
artists, programmers, writers, designers, agit-propers, filmmakers 
and reverse-engineers. Part studio, part club, part stage and part 
screen; C-Level is located in a basement in Chinatown Los Angeles and 
plays host to various events such as screenings, performances, 
lectures, debates, dances, readings and tournaments.
::

During the next 60 seconds, stop whatever you are  doing, and take this 
opportunity. (Literally it is only  1 minute) All you have to do is the 
following:  
You simply say an "Our Father" for the person that sent you  this message: 
Our Father who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom  Come, Thy 
Will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven.  Give us this day our daily 
bread and forgive us our  trespasses as we forgive those who trespass 
against us,  and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. For 
Thine is the Kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever,  Amen. 
Next, you send this message to everyone you know. In awhile,  more people 
will have prayed for you and you would have  obtained a lot of people 
praying for others. 
Next, stop and think and appreciate God's power in your life,  for doing 
what you know is pleasing to him. If you are  not ashamed to do this, 
follow the instructions. Jesus  said, "If you are ashamed of me, I will be 
ashamed of  you before My Father" 
If you are not ashamed, send this message...only if you believe.  "Yes, I 
love my God. He is my fountain of Life and My  Savior. He keeps me going day 
and night. Without Him, I  am no one. But with Him, I can do everything. 
Christ is  my strength." This is a simple test. If you love God and you are  
not ashamed of all the great things that He  has done for you, send this to 
everyone you know, and  the person who sent it to you. Thanks!!!

Ever notice how a 4  year old's voice is louder than 200 adult  voices?
----------------------------
Several years ago, I returned home  from a trip just when a storm hit
with crashing thunder and severe lightning.  As I came into my bedroom
about 2 a.m., I found my two children in bed with  my wife, Karey,
apparently scared by the loud storm. I resigned myself to  sleep in the
guest bedroom that night. The next day, I talked to the  children, and
explained that it was O.K. to sleep with Mom when the storm was  bad, but
when I was expected home, please don't sleep with Mom that night.  They
said ok. After my next trip several weeks later, Karey and the  children
picked me up in the terminal at the appointed time. Since the plane  was
late, everyone had come into the terminal to wait for my  plane's
arrival, along with hundreds of other folks waiting for their  arriving
passengers. As I entered the waiting area, my son saw me, and came  running
shouting, "Hi, Dad! I've got some good news!" As I waved back, I  said
loudly, "What's the good news?" "Nobody slept with Mommy while you were  away
this time!" Alex shouted. The
airport became very quiet, as everyone  in the waiting area looked at
Alex, then turned to me, and then searched the  rest of the area to see
if they could figure out exactly who his Mom  was.
----------------------------
An acquaintance of mine who is a  physician told this story about her
then 4 yr. old daughter. On the way to  preschool, the doctor had left
her stethoscope on the car seat, and her  little girl picked it up and
began playing with it. 'Be still, my heart,'  thought my friend, 'my daughter
wants to follow in my footsteps!'
Then the  child spoke into the instrument: "Welcome to McDonald's. May I
take your  order?"
-----------------
A certain little girl, when asked her name,  would reply, "I'm Mr.
Sugarbrown's daughter." Her mother told her this was  wrong, she must
say, "I'm Jane Sugarbrown." The pastor spoke to her in Sunday  School,
and said, "Aren't you Mr. Sugarbrown's daughter?" She replied,  "I
thought I was, but mother says I'm not."
-----------------
A Sunday  school teacher asked her little children, as they were on the
way to church  service, "And why is it necessary to be quiet in church?"
One bright little  girl replied,"Because people are sleeping."
-----------------
At the  beginning of a children's sermon, one girl came up to the altar
wearing a  beautiful dress. As the children were sitting down around the
pastor, he  leaned over and said to the girl, "That is a very pretty
dress. Is it your  Easter dress?" The girl replied almost directly into
the pastor's clip-on  mike, "Yes, and
my Mom says it's a bitch to  iron."
-----------------
And my personal favorite --- A little girl goes  to the barber shop with
her father. She stands next to the barber chair,  while her dad gets his
hair cut, eating a snack cake. The barber says to her,  "Sweetheart,
you're gonna get hair on your Twinkie." She says, "Yes, I know,  and I'm
gonna get boobs too."

A woman in a hot  air balloon realized she was lost.  She lowered altitude and spotted a man  below.  She descended a bit more and shouted, "Excuse me, can you help  me?  I promised a friend I would meet him in an hour ago, but I don't know  where I am..."
The man consulted  his GPS and replied, "You're in a hot air balloon approximately 30 feet above a  ground elevation of 2,346 feet above sea level.  You are 31 degrees, 14.97  minutes north latitude, and 100 degrees, 49.09 minutes west  longitude."
"You must be a  Republican," said the balloonist.
"I am," replied  the man.  "How did you know?"
"Well, answered  the balloonist, "everything you told me is technically correct, but I still have  no idea what to make of your information, and the fact is I am still lost.   Frankly, you haven't been much help so far."
The man responded,  "You must be a Democrat."
"I am," replied  the balloonist, "but how did you know?"
"Well," said the  man, "you don't know where you are or where you are going, you have risen to  where you are due to a large quantity of hot air, you made a promise which you  have no idea how to keep, and you expect me to solve your problem...  The  fact is, you are in exactly the same position you were in before we met, but  now, somehow, it's my fault!"

These are always funny.  Thought you might enjoy them.

The long awaited Darwin  Natural Selection Awards - Criminal Category have 
been released! ?These  awards are given each year to bestow upon that 
individual, who through  isolation by incarceration, has done the most to 
remove undesirable elements  from the human gene pool. 

RUNNER-UP # 9 Yankton, South Dakota: A woman  was arrested at her stepson's 
Boy Scout meeting. ?While watching a  policeman demonstrate his drug dog's 
ability, the dog found a bag of  marijuana in her purse. 

RUNNER-UP # 8 Colorado Springs: A guy walked  into a little corner store with 
a shotgun and demanded all the cash from the  cash drawer. ?After the cashier 
put the cash in a bag, the robber saw a  bottle of Scotch that he wanted 
behind the counter on the shelf. ?He  told the cashier to put it in the bag 
as 
well, but he refused and said  "Because I don't believe you are over 21." The 
robber said he was, but the  clerk still refused to give it to him because he 
didn't believe him.  ?At this point the robber took his drivers license out 
of 
his wallet  and gave it to the clerk. ?The clerk looked it over, and agreed 
that  the man was in fact over 21 and he put the Scotch in the bag. 
The robber  then ran from the store with his loot. ?The cashier promptly 
called the  police and gave the name and address of the robber that he got 
off 
the  license. ?They arrested the robber two hours later. 

RUNNER-UP # 7 A  woman was reporting her car as stolen, and mentioned that 
there was a car  phone in it. ?The policeman taking the report called the 
phone and told  the guy that answered that he had read the ad in the 
newspaper 
and wanted to  buy the car. ?They arranged to meet, and the thief was 
arrested.  

RUNNER-UP # 6 San Francisco: A man, wanting to rob a downtown Bank of  
America, walked into the branch and wrote "this iz a stikkup. ?Put all  your 
muny in this bag." While standing in line, waiting to give his note to  the 
teller, he began to worry that someone had seen him write the note and  might 
call the police before he reached the teller window. 
So he left  the Bank of America and crossed the street to Wells Fargo. 
After waiting a  few minutes in line, he handed his note to the Wells Fargo 
teller. ?She  read it and, surmising from his spelling errors that he was not 
the  brightest light in the harbor, told him that she could not accept his  
stickup note because it was written on a Bank of America deposit slip and  
that he would either have to fill out a Wells Fargo deposit slip or go back  
to Bank of America. ?Looking somewhat defeated, the man said "OK"  
and left. ?The Wells Fargo teller then called the police who arrested  the 
man 
a few minutes later, as he was waiting in line back at Bank of  America. 

RUNNER-UP # 5 From England: A motorist was unknowingly caught  in an 
automated 
speed trap that measured his speed using radar and  photographed his car. ?He 
later received in the mail a ticket for 40  Pounds and a photo of his car. 
Instead of payment, he sent the police  department a photograph of 40 pounds. 
? 
Several days later, he received  a letter from the police that contained 
another picture ...of handcuffs.  ?The motorist promptly sent the money for 
the fine. 

RUNNER-UP #  4 Drug Possession Defendant Christopher Jansen, on trial in 
March 
in  Pontiac, Michigan, said he had been searched without a warrant. ?The  
prosecutor said the officer didn't need a warrant because a "bulge" in  
Christopher's jacket could have been a gun. ?"Nonsense," said  Christopher, 
who happened to be wearing the same jacket that day in court.  ?He handed it 
over so the judge could see it. ?The judge  discovered a packet of cocaine in 
the pocket and laughed so hard he required  a five minute recess to compose 
himself. 

RUNNER-UP # 3 Oklahoma  City: Dennis Newton was on trial for the armed 
robbery 
of a convenience  store in district court when he fired his lawyer. 
Assistant District  Attorney Larry Jones said Newton, 47, was doing a fair 
job 
of defending  himself until the store manager testified that Newton was the 
robber.  ?Newton jumped up, accused the woman of lying and then said, "I 
should  of blown your (expletive) head off." The defendant paused, then 
quickly  added, "If I'd been the one that was there." The jury took 20 
minutes 
to  convict Newton and recommended a 30-year sentence. 

RUNNER-UP # 2  Detroit: R.C. ?Gaitlan, 21, walked up to two patrol officers 
who were  showing their squad car computer felon-location equipment to 
children in a  Detroit neighborhood. ?When he asked how the system worked, 
the 
officer  asked him for identification. ?Gaitlan gave them his driver's 
license,  they entered it into the computer, and moments later they arrested 
Gaitlan  because information on the screen showed Gaitlan was wanted for a  
two-year-old armed robbery in St. ?Louis, Missouri. 

RUNNER-UP #  1 Another from Detroit: A pair of Michigan robbers entered a 
record shop  nervously waving revolvers. ?The first one shouted, "Nobody 
move!" When  his partner moved, the startled first bandit shot him. 

THE WINNER A  Charlotte, NC, man having purchased a case of very rare, very 
expensive  cigars, insured them against fire among other things. ?Within a 
month,  having smoked his entire stockpile of cigars and without having made 
even  his first premium payment on the policy, the man filed a claim against 
the  insurance company. ?In his claim, the man stated the cigars were lost 
"in  
a series of small fires." The insurance company refused to pay, citing the  
obvious reason that the man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion.  ? 
The man sued.... ?and won. 
In delivering the ruling the  judge agreeing that the claim was frivolous, 
stated nevertheless that the  man held a policy from the company in which it 
had warranted that the cigars  were insurable and also guaranteed that it 
would insure against fire,  without defining what it considered to be 
"unacceptable fire," and was  obligated to pay the claim. ?Rather than endure 
a lengthy and costly  appeal process the insurance company accepted the 
ruling 
and paid the man  $15,000 for the rare cigars he lost in "the fires." After 
the man cashed the  check, however, the company had him arrested on 24 counts 
of arson.  ?With his own insurance claim and testimony from the previous 
case  
being used against him, the man was convicted of intentionally burning his  
insured property and sentenced to 24 months in jail and a $24,000 fine.

"Attention Taliban! You are condemned. Did you know that? The instant the terrorists you support took over our planes, you sentenced yourselves to death. The Armed Forces of the United States are here to seek justice for our dead. Highly trained soldiers are coming to shut down once and for all Osama bin Laden's ring of terrorism, and the Taliban that supports them and their actions. 
"Our forces are armed with state of the art military equipment. What are you using, obsolete and ineffective weaponry? Our helicopters will rain fire down upon your camps before you detect them on your radar. Our bombs are so accurate we can drop them right through your windows. Our infantry is trained for any climate and terrain on earth. United States soldiers fire with superior marksmanship and are armed with superior weapons. 
"You have only one choice ... Surrender now and we will give you a second chance. We will let you live. If you surrender no harm will come to you. When you decide to surrender, approach United States forces with your hands in the air. Sling your weapon across your back muzzle towards the ground. Remove your magazine and expel any rounds. Doing this is your only chance of survival."

A woman was very distraught at the fact that she had not  had a date
or
any
sex in quite some time.
She was afraid she might have something wrong with her so  she decided
to
seek the medical
expertise of a sex therapist. Her doctor  recommended that she see the
well-known Chinese sex therapist,
so she went to see him.
Upon entering the examination room, Dr. Chang said, "OK,  take off all
you
crose."
The woman did  as she was told.
"Now, get down and craw  reery, reery fass to odder side of room."
Again, the woman did as she was instructed.
Dr. Chang then said, "OK, now craw  reery, reery fass back to me."
So she  did.
Dr. Chang shook his head slowly and said, "Your probrem vewy bad. You
haf
Ed Zachary Disease.
Worse case I ever see. Dat why you not haf sex or  dates."
Worried, the woman asked  anxiously, "Oh my God, Dr. Chang, what is Ed
Zachary Disease?"
Dr. Chang looked the woman in the eye and replied, "Ed  Zachary
Disease is
when your face
rook  Ed Zachary rike your ass."

One fine morning, every thing was going smooth as usual. Suddenly,the
motors screeched with a sudden brake, when every one in the city couldn't
believe what had happened to America. It was in New York where the scene was

going very hectic. People cried out of shame.
Many where blaming the former president Mr. Bill Clinton. Hillary stood
staring at her darling husband. Clinton came to the crowd and said in
his words, "I'm Innocent, It's really dramatic to say I'm the only man
behind all these cases. Slowly, I feel I'm loosing confidence on myself".
Are you curious to know what had happened ...
