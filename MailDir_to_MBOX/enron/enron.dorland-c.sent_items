Hey Chris,


     How are you doing? Sorry I haven't gotten back to you sooner regarding
Stickley, but I was doing research to see if I could find any information
about the company.  Unfortunately, I had no success.  I have contacted Mega
group, (our buying group) to see if perhaps they had any information, but...
again another brick wall.  I cannot find a web site, or any listing in
"Furniture Today" (a listing of all manufacturers in the U.S.)  If I come
across anything I will let you know.  Do you know what pieces in particular
this fellow is looking for?  Perhaps we could source another vendor.??
     If I can be of further assistance, please feel free to call, email,
fax, or send message via messenger pigeon; whichever method you perfer.

Looking forward to your next contact.

E.T.   (better known as Sherry).

Subject:	RE: Critical Applications, Models and Data

Chris - In order that we are able to set up the transfer of files in an orderly fashion and, more importantly,  maintain security protections for certain directories (e.g. legal) I believe a better approach is to replicate our existing directory tree structure under a new I:/Newco/ directory.  At this level we can then break things out into the required subfolders (e.g. accounting, trading, legal, ...). 

In this regard we have set up the I:/Newco/ directory and started to create subfolders. I ask everyone who has put information in the I:/trading/newco directory to move it to  I:/Newco/ under their applicable subdirectory (which may need to be created).  I apologize that this is a hassle for those who have already transfered files.

If you have any concerns please let me know.

Regards
Chris

Subject:	Critical Applications, Models and Data

Hi everyone!

Once again I find myself being tasked by Geof Storey. Houston has requested that we make lists of all applications that we use and also that we consolidate all of the files (models and data) that are critical to our business (I don't think MP3's count) into one directory on the network. This is so that these items can be included in the proposed deal with newco. The Calgary Trading group has set up a directory on I:/trading/newco and I think if each group did the same that would be great. Each group should probably have one person in charge of the directory so there isn't any overlap. Call me with any ?'s/

Thanx 

Chris

Dave,

I just wanted to touch base with you on the cash trade that you intermediated between Stephane and Cascade this morning. I don't really feel that it is Stephane's responsibility to manage Cascades price risk and I think that you are out of line for accusing him of running over your customer. If you would like we could look at doing an  MSA with Cascade where by we could sell them gas at Sumas DI.

Strong decade foreseen for real estate 
'Demand for all types of housing is set to surge': Aging Baby Boomers, their children and immigrants to drive residential prices
Paul Vieira 
Financial Post 
The tail end of the Baby Boom generation, along with children of aging boomers and new immigrants to Canada, will keep the residential real estate market strong over the next 10 years, driving the average value of a house up 13%, a new study suggests.
"Demand for all types of housing is set to surge ahead over the coming decade, leading to robust activity, rising prices and a stable investment climate," says the study, jointly written by ReMax Ontario-Atlantic Canada, ReMax Western Canada and Clayton Research.
And Calgary will have the hottest real estate market, with housing prices set to climb 20% to 25% in the next decade, the study says.
Overall, the number of households will increase by 1.5 million over the next 10 years, leading to rising prices for existing homes and steady demand for newly built homes.
Peter Norman, vice-president of Clayton Research, a Toronto-based real estate consulting firm, said the increase will be fuelled by three factors: younger Baby Boomers, between the ages of 35 to 45, who are looking to buy their first home or upgrade from their current residence; the children of the older Boomers, generally 45 to 55, who will be entering the real estate market for the first time; and immigrants.
"Housing prices will remain quite firm over the next 10 years and move up in real terms" Mr. Norman said in an interview.
The combination of high rents and low rental vacancies, particularly in cities such as Toronto and Vancouver, will also help drive the housing market, as will the fact that there has been little or no construction of new rental units.
And mortgage rates are so low that buying is often as financially palatable as renting, Mr. Norman added.
The study concluded that the economy, although in a slump, is in much better shape than it was at the eve of the 1990s recession. Productivity and real income growth have recovered, unemployment is at lower levels than a decade ago, and the country's industrial structure has shifted away from a commodity and manufacturing base, the study said.
"A healthy, long-term economy will boost housing markets by keeping real incomes growing, real interest rates low, and providing confidence in the future performance of real estate assets."
Pamela Alexander, chief executive of ReMax Ontario-Atlantic Canada, said Calgary would be the hottest market in the country thanks to increasing oilpatch activity, migration from other parts of the country and its youthful population.
"Calgary is going through its renaissance period," Ms. Alexander said, adding that its average home price of $180,000 is still 30% to 35% cheaper than Vancouver or Toronto.
Toronto, with its average house price of $250,000, should see growth of 10% to 15%, Ms. Alexander said, because its population is heavily weighted toward 25 to 40 year olds -- who will buy their first home or upgrade -- and because of the scarcity of rental units.
Meanwhile, Ottawa, despite the high-tech downturn, remained one of the hottest housing markets with prices up 10% from a year ago. That market is expected to grow as the federal government increases spending and creates new departments, older civil servants retire and new people are brought in, and the high-tech sector rebounds.

Thanx for the pos report. Would you mind sending it to me each morning? Also, can you make sure that they have all of the deals (other than the few I have done) transferred out of my book by the end of the week. I talked to Brian? and he said he would look after it but can you make sure it happens.
 
Thanx,

Brad,

I need to top up my RRSP for 2001. My contribution limit from my tax return for 2000 is $10881. I have contributed about $5500 through Enron and Enron has contributed $3200 to my pension plan. Am I correct to assume that I can contribute about $2000. The part I wasn't sure about was the pension contributions. Let me know and I will send you a check.

Chris

PS I am going to Vancouver next weekend to look at buying a sweet Porsche

You are in charge. I think some DVD's is a super plan. I was also thinking that a really nice hammock would be a great gift but I have no idea where to get one. I will talk to mom and see if she knows where we could get one.

No chance of me getting back on the cougar trail. I have devoted myself to scouting out dumb blondes under the age of 25. Ideally I will find some 22 year old Britney Spears look alike. Wish me well.

To sleep.....I bet the next time you have a couple drinks and no talent is in sight you'll be giving her a call.  Hottie from picture has a large E and blow problem - had to split - too much for this hayseed from RD.  Matt's stag is on Aug long.  I think you told me you weren't going to make it but you are coming to the wedding, right?  I'm just trying to plan how many dudes for golf.

December 3, 2001
Enron files for Chapter 11 owing US$13B 
Canadian unit may survive: Filing allows energy giant to operate while restructuring
Peter Fitzpatrick 
Financial Post, with files from wire services 
Enron Corp. is seeking bankruptcy protection in one of the largest Chapter 11 filings in history, but its Canadian subsidiary is hoping to survive the energy giant's implosion.
Houston-based Enron took the widely-expected step yesterday in New York City. It was the latest humiliation for the leading U.S. energy trader, which boasted US$100-billion in revenue and US$1-billion in profit last year, but whose shares lost US$26-billion in market value in less than two months because of accounting concerns.
"While uncertainty during the past few weeks has severely impacted the market's confidence in Enron and its trading operations, we are taking the steps announced today to help preserve capital, stabilize our businesses, restore the confidence of our trading counterparties, and enhance our ability to pay our creditors," Ken Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. Enron listed about US$24.7-billion in assets and US$13.1-billion in debts in court papers. The largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy in history was Texaco Inc.'s US$35.9-billion filing in 1987.
The filing will allow Enron to continue operating while it negotiates a recovery plan with creditors, including the likely layoff of thousands of its 7,400 employees. It also blocks debt-collection efforts, lawsuits and other actions against the company.
Enron, which is looking to obtain debtor-in- possession financing to let it carry on, also said it is suing Dynegy Inc. for US$10-billion.
Dynegy triggered the collapse when it backed out of a US$23-billion takeover bid for Enron last week. Dynegy balked after learning Enron had overstated earnings by US$580-million since 1997 and had debt in outside partnerships that reduced shareholder equity by US$1.2-billion.
Enron's European arm went into bankruptcy last Thursday but it appears yesterday's filing did not cover its Canadian operation, Enron Canada Corp.
Calls yesterday to the Calgary-based subsidiary were not returned but in an affidavit filed in an Alberta court Friday, Robson Milnthorp, president and chief executive of the Canadian subsidiary, said he had been told by the parent company's lawyers that Enron Canada and its affiliates would be not be covered by any U.S. filing.
Enron Canada employs 143. It markets and trades electrical power and natural gas and has about $2.1-billion worth of contracts with hundreds of Canadian companies.
Mr. Milnthorp said in the affidavit that Enron Canada is a viable company on its own, but it needs time for advisors it has hired to negotiate with investors and potential buyers to recapitalize the firm.
Enron Canada asked for a stay under the Canada Business Corporations Act to prevent its partners in Canada from cancelling contracts, which they are able to do because the parent company can no longer guarantee them.
"Under the current climate of market hysteria, it is important to quiet things down and permit Enron Canada to demonstrate its financial strength and ability to perform independently of Enron Corp.," Mr. Milnthorp pleaded.
Although Justice D.G. Hart denied the stay, he told Enron to come back Wednesday once it had notified its Canadian partners of the application. Yesterday, however, a source familiar with the case said such a bid would be stillborn.
"If they try to do this application on Wednesday, there will be a ton of opposition. It will be almost impossible for them to get this order through," said the source, speaking before the Chapter 11 was announced.
The source said Enron Canada's only alternative may be to seek protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act, although that may be of no help since such a filing could also trigger contract cancellations.
Enron Corp.'s collapse leaves a global creditor list. Citigroup Inc., the largest U.S. financial services company, is owed US$3-billion from two loans and J.P. Morgan Chase's Chase Manhattan Bank is owed more than US$1.9-billion. In Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce has a US$215-million exposure. Other Canadian banks downplayed or did not comment upon the situation last week.
Standard & Poor's said banks and other financial institutions face losses of US$6.3-billion through credit derivatives.

Liz,

As this reception is targetted towards the more executive level within each
company and because we have a venue that has a maximum capacity (and have
been receiving mostly positive RSVP's), we have carefully chosen the
individuals to whom we have extended invitations to this reception.  After
speaking with Brian Tanaka, he would be comfortable in extending an
invitation to Chad,  Stephane and yourself only.

Please call if you have any questions.

Hi,

I'm wondering if I can trade physical Stanfield gas on EOL. We are looking to back gas off from the 70,000 firm we ship. I'd like to be able to purchase Stanfield gas and back it off back to Aeco. Our Houston guys would prefer this to us calling back and forth all day and deciding on volumes and prices. Is this possible and how do we need to get it set up??

Thanks,
Ryan

I think I saw her. If it was her she was pretty cute. Dan and I went to Earls last night and then just chilled. His flight was 2 hours late and they lost his bags. We are going back to the Deer tonight and I am going to have some people over tommorow pre-whiskey (around 7:30). You should come by tommorow night. My home number is 214-0454 and my cell is 875-6146. Talk to you later.

Possibly, she's got dark hair that's just above her shoulders. I don't really
recall if there was anyone else coming in at the same time.
How's Dan? Did you guys do anything last night?
Is there a plan yet for tomorrow?

Subject:	RE: Critical Applications, Models and Data

Chris - In order that we are able to set up the transfer of files in an orderly fashion and, more importantly,  maintain security protections for certain directories (e.g. legal) I believe a better approach is to replicate our existing directory tree structure under a new I:/Newco/ directory.  At this level we can then break things out into the required subfolders (e.g. accounting, trading, legal, ...). 

In this regard we have set up the I:/Newco/ directory and started to create subfolders. I ask everyone who has put information in the I:/trading/newco directory to move it to  I:/Newco/ under their applicable subdirectory (which may need to be created).  I apologize that this is a hassle for those who have already transfered files.

If you have any concerns please let me know.

Regards
Chris

Subject:	Critical Applications, Models and Data

Hi everyone!

Once again I find myself being tasked by Geof Storey. Houston has requested that we make lists of all applications that we use and also that we consolidate all of the files (models and data) that are critical to our business (I don't think MP3's count) into one directory on the network. This is so that these items can be included in the proposed deal with newco. The Calgary Trading group has set up a directory on I:/trading/newco and I think if each group did the same that would be great. Each group should probably have one person in charge of the directory so there isn't any overlap. Call me with any ?'s/

Thanx 

Chris

Ryan,

What's up? I don't know if you heard yet but it looks like I am moving back to Calgary in mid September. I will see you August 17. I'm coming home for Matt and Jen's wedding. Take it easy.

Mike,

I am not coming to Vancouver this weekend after all. The car I really wanted to look at sold so I am postponing my trip. I will probably be coming out in the next month or so and I will let you know. Take it easy. Do you have John Hughes' e-mail address?

Chris,

I have included a "TCPL Map"  that includes the Alliance pipeline.  Alliance data lags one day behind today's date so the flows on the Alliance pipeline for today appear as 0.

If one year ago you bought $1000 worth of Nortel today it would be worth $50. If one year ago today you bought $1000 worth of budweiser, drank all of it and returned the cans you would have $80.

Keith,

How was Portland? I'm out of the office moving most of Monday but I'll give you a call on Tuesday. Did you get a chance to drop of my keys at the rental office?

Chris

Matt,

That is cool. I can't really change the trip but I am sure I will be back in Vancouver soon. Send me your vitals and I'll let you know the next time I am in town. Or give me shout if you are ever out in Calgary. Do you have Atkinson's office phone number? I seem to have misplaced it. 

Thanx

Chris,
 
I can't do February 2nd.  As it turns out my gal made  dinner arrangements a while ago with another couple for the evening of the  2nd.  Is there anyway you could either come a week earlier or later? I'd  love to have a few with you.  Let me know.  Have you called Bill  Ryan?
 
Regards,

What is this thing? Mo got into the MBA program at the Rotterdam School of Management. How perfect is that? Going to do his MBA in Holland. You should call and congratulate him. It is actually a really good school. I am definately going to visit.

Absolutely.  When is you term date here in the USA so I can use this date to run the calculation?

Also, here is the information you requested

401k

When you return to Canada, you can either roll over your 401k to qualified IRA or you can request a distribution from Northern Trust. If you choose to receive the distribution, you will be taxed 20% Federal and then 10% penalty.  Northern Trust @ 800-316-7526

The Cash Balance Plan

If you are vested (at least 5 years with the company) you would be eligilbe for a distribution.  If you go to the HR Web page,
click on Benefits, A New Look For  Benefits, Pension Plan.  Then you will need to type in your ss# and pin  (which is the last four digits of your ss#)  It will lead you to a place where you could see how to calculate this figure.  You can request a distribution by calling x37979  then press Option 2 Cash  Balance Plan.

Chris, this is a year-end adjustment that will be done for your T4 prior to processing them.  Your final pay stub will stay the same as I cannot go back and re-issue those.

I'm going to use the 18K number we have record of and adjust the balance down.

Have you looked in to the stock option line item on my pay stub yet? The number on the stub is about 36000 and I think about 18000 is accurate.

Ian,
 
When I said spread I didn't mean graph the basis as opposed to the fixed price (these graphs are essentially identical to the first ones you did) I want a graph of the relationship (spread) between the 2 points. i.e. if Nov-Mar Sumas was marked at 0.20 and Nov-Mar Aeco was marked at (0.45) the Nov-Mar Sumas Aeco spread would be 0.65. Sorry if I wasn't clear. Call me with any ?s.

Thanx looks good. What I was really looking for was the relationship between Sumas and each of those points for the N-M and A-O strips.
 
Can you put these graphs together for me.

Dad,

Just though I would let you know I talked to a Royal Bank credit specialist this morning and he will get back to me this afternoon. I also talked to Jordan and he is going to take call Linda and get going on the paper work. I think I am going to come back to Calgary September 6-7 to finalize everything. There is an Enron Canada offsite in Banff that weekend (Sept 7-9) that I should go to. Thanx again for all your help this weekend.

I just want to understand which regulatory body oversees the pipeline and what (if any) rules will apply to creating a wall between the pipe and Duke's marketing organization. Let me know when you have got a minute.

Tamara,

Thanx for the info. I have 17" wheels on it now so I guess I will have to get wheels and tires. Do you know what the 16" wheels look like? Is there somewhere on the net I can see an example. Also I will need to have my car winterized (install a blockheater ect...) when I move back so I will give you a call then.

Chris,

Please disregard my last e-mail. I guess I completely misunderstood your
message. I just need to know if your tires are 16 or 17 inch. If the are 17
inch you will need wheels and tires, but if they are only 16 inch then tires
are all you need. Reason being, it is recommended that the IS300 is driven
with 16 inch tires in the winter time. For pricing you are looking at
$1686.00+gst
(17 inch) and $746.00+gst (16 inch). The brand of tires that are recommended
are Michelin Pilot Alpine Roh extreme wheel.
If you need any other information please e-mail or phone @ (403)291-2111

Al,

I am moving to Calgary from Houston and am wondering if Lexus has a
winter wheel/tire package for the 2001 IS 300. If not could you
recommend a wheel / tire dealer in Calgary who could help me find
something that would work. Thanx for your time.

Can you please set up a flexible template in excel so that we can fool around with the numbers on our X forecast and make copies of the historical data for the last 3 winters for everyone. I would like to have this done today so I can see the finished product before the meeting. Let me know if you have any questions.

Hello All 
 
Per the General announcement that went out a couple weeks ago I had requested all Time off (Flex days and Vacation) and Sick days for all employees since June 1st (or your start date).  The information is required to determine your carry forward allocation.  Without an e-mail indicating your time off I will not be able to update the new system and no carry forward dates  will be processed.  Even if you have not taken time off I need to know.  Also if you have any future time off requested and approved please forward those dates.  
 
Thanks in advance for your cooperation and assistance...
 
Send those e-mails...

Thank-you,

rts, thinks Enron's 2001 earnings will fall 6 cents short of the consensus =
estimate of $1.79. The firm also believes Enron stock should trade around $=
30, nearly 50% below Wednesday's $59.20.  The firm's 26-page report, publis=
hed May 6, highlights Enron's declining profitability and increasing levera=
ge and suggests that the company should trade on the same sort of multiple =
as a trading firm like Goldman Sachs (GS :NYSE - news ), which has a 2001 p=
rice-to-earnings ratio about half of Enron's 33 times. OWS also alleges tha=
t Enron's earnings quality is poor and that key parts of its financial stat=
ements are confusing and opaque.  Houston-based Enron didn't comment by pub=
lication time on elements of the report that Detox  sent the company. An en=
ergy analyst who is bullish on Enron's outlook says the OWS report contains=
 fundamental misunderstandings about the energy market and Enron's business=
 model, but he says the report does include some ground-breaking and valid =
insights. (The analyst's firm doesn't give stock recommendations.)  Economi=
es of Scale Why care what Off Wall Street writes, compared with, say, analy=
sts at Merrill Lynch (MER :NYSE - news )? For one, OWS has an excellent tra=
ck record. Particularly sweet was 2000, when the tech stocks it had bashed =
came crashing down. It has also shown itself to be well ahead of the curve,=
 recommending that clients sell e-tailer priceline.com (PCLN :Nasdaq - news=
 ) in June 1999, when faith in Internet stocks was at its blindest and thei=
r prices at their most insane.      Pulling Back Enron retreats after long =
rally   Enron, with its domination of a burgeoning energy market, annual re=
venue of over $100 billion and impressive earnings growth, can hardly be ra=
nked alongside the likes of priceline. But OWS thinks Enron is set for a pr=
ecipitous drop nonetheless. Why?  OWS's main beef is that key profitability=
 measures are in decline. Margins on Enron's pretax operating earnings (whi=
ch the company's earnings releases call IBIT, or income before interest, ta=
xes and other items) are falling. Total IBIT of $795 million in the first q=
uarter amounted to only 1.59% of the $50 billion in revenue for the period,=
 compared with a 2.08% margin in the fourth quarter and 4.75% in the year-e=
arlier period. Revenue in the first quarter was nearly quadrupled from the =
year-earlier period, yet IBIT rose only 27%. This shrinkage is due to lower=
-margin trading income making up an increasingly large share of Enron's rev=
enue base.  OWS thus calculates that for the remainder of 2001 Enron needs =
to generate an extra $2.1 billion in revenue for each additional penny it m=
akes over its 2000 EPS of $1.47 to reach analysts' expectation of $1.79.  T=
he energy analyst counters that OWS apparently hasn't grasped how Enron can=
 continue to increase earnings even when margins shrink. It does so simply =
by increasing volumes as the energy market balloons in size. In other words=
, margins may decline, but since revenues are so much higher, earnings stil=
l go up. Illustrating this, first-quarter 2001 EPS of 49 cents was 23% ahea=
d of the year-ago figure, even though the IBIT margin shrank by 3.2 percent=
age points. The analyst thinks Enron will make $1.82 per share in 2001.  Gr=
owing On You In addition, the huge growth in the energy market that has so =
helped Enron is likely to continue for several years, according to the anal=
yst. He notes that roughly 75% of the electricity available in the U.S. sti=
ll isn't traded in a market. "Eventually it will be part of a competitive e=
nvironment, but it'll take five to 10 years," says the analyst. And he beli=
eves the extreme volatility in energy-related commodities that has also ben=
efited Enron will exist for longer than OWS projects.  Still, OWS's point o=
n profitability is bolstered by other profit measures. Return on capital (n=
et income as a percentage of equity plus debt) was 6.6% in 2000, down on 19=
99's 6.9% and well below the 2000 returns on capital at Duke (DUK :NYSE - n=
ews ) (11.8%), Dynegy (DYN :NYSE - news ) (12.1%) and even Goldman (8.9%). =
 Even Enron bulls will admit that its financials are hard to follow. For ex=
ample, it doesn't give a gross margin number for its wholesale services, or=
 trading, business, which accounts for 96% of revenue. But one area of the =
company's financial statements registered with the Securities and Exchange =
Commission that consistently bugs analysts is the part that describes Enron=
's related party transactions, which are the deals it does with entities th=

 The reason for maintaining these hard-to-follow related party deals has be=

I thought you would like it...

It is the end-all be-all of Grand Cherokees.

Retail is $52,300 - your cash price is $45,488 including rebates.

As for Sept 6/7, what I will do is bring down the matching twin of the Jeep
in the Silverstone colour for you to play with.  It is a demo and identical
to the black one other than the exterior colour, so you will be able to see
what you think of it.

How does that sound?

I think Rob and I might try to golf (or just hit some balls) after work. If we do we will probably go to Tradition (way North). I'll let you know. If I'm not going to be home I could leave your Amex in an envelope at the office of my apartment or you could grab it when I get back. Let me know...

Mike,

I am really looking forward to Matt and Jen's wedding. I bought a new lampshade to wear. Be sure to get Matt all fucked up on the stag. Talk to you later.

Strong decade foreseen for real estate 
'Demand for all types of housing is set to surge': Aging Baby Boomers, their children and immigrants to drive residential prices
Paul Vieira 
Financial Post 
The tail end of the Baby Boom generation, along with children of aging boomers and new immigrants to Canada, will keep the residential real estate market strong over the next 10 years, driving the average value of a house up 13%, a new study suggests.
"Demand for all types of housing is set to surge ahead over the coming decade, leading to robust activity, rising prices and a stable investment climate," says the study, jointly written by ReMax Ontario-Atlantic Canada, ReMax Western Canada and Clayton Research.
And Calgary will have the hottest real estate market, with housing prices set to climb 20% to 25% in the next decade, the study says.
Overall, the number of households will increase by 1.5 million over the next 10 years, leading to rising prices for existing homes and steady demand for newly built homes.
Peter Norman, vice-president of Clayton Research, a Toronto-based real estate consulting firm, said the increase will be fuelled by three factors: younger Baby Boomers, between the ages of 35 to 45, who are looking to buy their first home or upgrade from their current residence; the children of the older Boomers, generally 45 to 55, who will be entering the real estate market for the first time; and immigrants.
"Housing prices will remain quite firm over the next 10 years and move up in real terms" Mr. Norman said in an interview.
The combination of high rents and low rental vacancies, particularly in cities such as Toronto and Vancouver, will also help drive the housing market, as will the fact that there has been little or no construction of new rental units.
And mortgage rates are so low that buying is often as financially palatable as renting, Mr. Norman added.
The study concluded that the economy, although in a slump, is in much better shape than it was at the eve of the 1990s recession. Productivity and real income growth have recovered, unemployment is at lower levels than a decade ago, and the country's industrial structure has shifted away from a commodity and manufacturing base, the study said.
"A healthy, long-term economy will boost housing markets by keeping real incomes growing, real interest rates low, and providing confidence in the future performance of real estate assets."
Pamela Alexander, chief executive of ReMax Ontario-Atlantic Canada, said Calgary would be the hottest market in the country thanks to increasing oilpatch activity, migration from other parts of the country and its youthful population.
"Calgary is going through its renaissance period," Ms. Alexander said, adding that its average home price of $180,000 is still 30% to 35% cheaper than Vancouver or Toronto.
Toronto, with its average house price of $250,000, should see growth of 10% to 15%, Ms. Alexander said, because its population is heavily weighted toward 25 to 40 year olds -- who will buy their first home or upgrade -- and because of the scarcity of rental units.
Meanwhile, Ottawa, despite the high-tech downturn, remained one of the hottest housing markets with prices up 10% from a year ago. That market is expected to grow as the federal government increases spending and creates new departments, older civil servants retire and new people are brought in, and the high-tech sector rebounds.

Wayne,

I was talking to Kevin Presto and he mentioned that you have a plane going to Portland. I need to get to Calgary and Kevin suggested I look into catching a ride with you and getting them to swing north and drop me off on their way back. Can you let me know when you plan to leave and if it isn't an inconvience I will talk to Lavo and see if he is OK with it.

Thanx

Kiron,

I am not that familiar with the corporate finance side of the business but I will ask around as to who would be a good person for you to contact. You might want to start with Kyle Kitagawa who is a VP in our Calgary corporate finance group. You can reach him at kyle.kitagawa@enron.com or 403-974-6700. Let me know if I can be any further help. 

Regards,

Chris Dorland

Hi Chris, 
 
I have just completed an MBA at IVEY and am looking to you for help and  advice.
 
I am interested to work at Enron in the  Corporate Finance Area.
 
This is specifically in the Capital Raising Function (Mergers &  Acquisitions, IPOs etc).
 
As per my understanding this could also be part of a Treasury area.
 
I am unsure of this. I am unable to ascertain this  information from the website.
 
My guess is that this might be based in the US at the Head  Office.
 
At this point I am looking for some direction (someone who you could refer  me to in the US) 
 
who could provide me this information or deal with this matter directly  (non-HR).
 
Could you give me some feedback in this regard.
 
By way of background, I have just completed an  MBA at the Richard Ivey School of business in London Ontario -  Canada.
 
Apart from this I bring to the table a good  amount of experience in the field of finance.
 
As a Chartered Accountant, I have over 7 years  international experience in the field of finance as an  Analyst - Financial Valuation, 
 
an Analyst - Equity Research  and as an Equities Dealer and  finally in the Risk  Management area.  
 
Last summer I worked at the Royal Bank Dominion  Securities Toronto as an Equities Research Associate - Gold Mining.  
 
I hope to hear from you in the near future.
 
Cheers
 
Kiron Vaghela   C.A.  M.B.A.

What are you doing for the rest of the weekend.  Should I talk to Ry-Ry, some ladies, etc and set up a night where we hit the town?  Or do you have plans.  Keep me posted.

   1999 SURVIVAL GUIDE FOR TAKING A DUMP AT WORK. 
   ESCAPEE 
   Definition: 
     A fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal   or 
   forcing poop in a stall. This is usually  accompanied by a sudden wave 
   of panic/embarrassment.  This is similar to the hot flash you receive 
   when  passing an unseen police car and speeding. If you release an 
   escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen. If you  are 
   standing next to the farter at the urinal, pretend  that you did not 
   hearit. No one likes an escapee, it  is uncomfortable for all involved. 
   Making a joke or  laughing makes both parties feel uneasy. 
   JAILBREAK (Used in conjunction with escapee) 
   Definition: When forcing poop, several farts slip out at a machine  guns 
   pace. This is usually a side effect of diarrhea  or a hangover. If this 
   should happen do not panic,  remain in the stall until everyone has left 
   the  bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just 
   occurred. 
   COURTESY FLUSH 
   Definition: The act of  flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of 
   the  poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an 
   undisclosed location. This reduces the amount of air time the poop  has 
   to stink up the bathroom. This can help you avoid  being caught doing 
   the 
   WALK OF SHAME. 
   WALK OF SHAME 
   Definition: Walking from  the stall, to the sink, to the door after you 
   have  just stunk-up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable 
   moment 
   if someone walks in and busts you. As with all farts, it is  best to 
   pretend that the smell does not exist. Can be  avoided with the use of a 
   COURTESY FLUSH. 
   OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER 
   Definition: A  colleague who poops at work and is damn proud of it. You 
   will often see an Out of the Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with 
   newspaper or magazine under their arm. Always look  around the office 
   for 
   the Out of the Closet pooper  before entering the bathroom. 
   THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (PFN) 
   Definition: A group of coworkers who band together to ensure  emergency 
   pooping goes off without incident. This  group can help you to monitor 
   the whereabouts of OUT  OF THE CLOSET POOPERS and identify SAFE HAVENS. 
   SAFE HAVEN 
   Definition: A seldom used  bathroom somewhere in the building where you 
   can least  expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the 
   opposite sex. This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex 
   entering 
   the bathroom. 
   TURD BURGLAR 
   Definition: A pooper who  does not realize that you are in the stall and 
   tries  to force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and 
   vulnerable moments that occur when taking a dump at work. If  this 
   occurs, remain in the stall until the TURD  BURGLAR leaves. This way you 
   will avoid all  uncomfortable eye contact. 
   CAMO-COUGH 
   Definition: A phony cough  which alerts all new entrants into the 
   bathroom that  you are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a 
   WATERMELON or to alert potential TURD BURGLARS. Very effective when 
   used 
    in 
   conjunction with  an ASTAIRE. 
   ASTAIRE 
   Definition: A subtle toe-tap  that is used to alert potential TURD 
   BURGLARS that you  are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt 
   that 
   the stall is occupied. If you hear an ASTAIRE, leave the  bathroom 
   immediately so the pooper can poop in  peace. 
   WATERMELON 
   Definition: A turd that  creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet 
   water.  This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a WATERMELON 
   coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH. 
   HAVANA OMELET 
   Definition: A load of  diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes 
   in the  toilet water. Often accompanied by an escapee. Try using a 
   CAMO-COUGH with an ASTAIRE. 
   UNCLE TED 
   Definition: A bathroom user  who seems to linger around forever. Could 
   spend  extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the 
   pot. An UNCLE TED makes it difficult to relax while on the  crapper, as 
    you 
   should  always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty.This 
   benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees. 
   FLY BY 
   Definition: The act of scouting  out a bathroom before pooping. Walk in, 
   check for  other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and 
   come back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER.   People may 
   become suspicious if they catch you  constantly going into the bathroom. 
   CRACK WHORE 
   Definition: A crapper that  has seen more ass than a Greyhound Bus. 
   Tell tale  signs of a CRACK WHORE include hairs, stains and streaks. 
   Avoid CRACK WHORES at all cost. Try finding out when the janitor  cleans 
   each particular bathroom. Don't forget with a  good cleaning,a CRACK 
    WHORE 
   can become a SAFE HAVEN.

Hi Chris,
Thank you for your quote request  on the Grand Cherokee.
I am just getting some numbers for you and I was  curious if you had decided if you were looking to purchase, finance, or  lease.
Just let me know and I will put together all the options for you  so you can see the different costs and/or monthly payments and decide what works  for you.
Thanks very much,

Hi Traci,

I hope you are having a good week. I am still a little tired from the weekend. Went out with my brother and a bunch of friends friday and saturday. Superbowl on sunday. Made for a very long monday. I have cooking class #2 tonight (soups and stocks). Should be a good time. Starting to get a little busier at work. Hopefully we will be up and trading sometime next week. I am coming to Red Deer this weekend. If you aren't busy we should do something on Saturday night. Have a great week and I will talk to you soon. 

Chris

Glad to hear all is well. I meant to comment that I thought the people profiled in the article should pull their heads out of their self important asses. It isn't about finding the meaning of life at work. It is all about the $$$. Work hard. Make $$$. Retire young. Things with me are great. Moving back to Calgary in about a month which is a little sooner than I thought I would be going back but when opportunity knocks you gotta go. Take care.

I don't hear from you in months and then you level me with such a thought
provoking, soul searching article.  Thanks for thinking of me to send it to.
  I really enjoyed reading it.  We certainly fit into certain parts of the
article.  There are a few life theories like that which working through.
Its all interesting stuff.

How are things going with you?  Are you enjoying Houston?

London has been great.  Brokering over here has been pretty rewarding.
Traders over here seem to have a lot more respect for other humans.
Catriona is well and has landed herself a pretty cool job in PR.

Keep in touch,

Mike

Subject:	Toronto Star: Banks said preparing Enron bids 

Dec. 11, 01:00 EDT Banks said preparing Enron bids 
Other big lenders may make offers later, reports say
	
NEW YORK (AP) - Citigroup Inc. and UBS AG are reportedly preparing rival bids to purchase the sputtering trading operations of Enron Corp., the Houston-based energy giant that filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this month. 
The two investment banks are expected to make separate proposals as early as this week to a New York bankruptcy court, the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times reported yesterday, citing unidentified sources. 
Enron's trading business, which accounted for roughly 90 per cent of earnings in the third quarter, has deteriorated in recent weeks because of uncertainty about Enron's finances. 
JP Morgan Chase and Co., which like Citigroup is a large Enron creditor, is expected to submit its own offer at a later stage, the newspapers said. The potential size of the bids was not reported. 
Shares of Enron climbed 4 cents (U.S.) to close at 79 cents yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Negotiators for Enron, Citigroup and UBS met over the weekend to finalize the details of the proposals, although sources warned that either one may still be withdrawn, the newspapers said. 
According to the reports, Enron would retain a large minority stake under the terms of the proposals being prepared. 
Representatives from Citigroup and UBS said their companies would not comment on the matter. Enron did not immediately return calls seeking comment. 
Just months ago, Enron was the country's seventh-largest company in terms of revenue. 
But the company stock plummeted after the company in October revealed questionable partnerships that helped keep billions of dollars of debt off its books and Enron acknowledged it overstated profits for four years. 
The swift collapse has launched investigations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, labor department, justice department and a congressional committee. 
Yesterday, Enron said it will negotiate a retention plan for some of its remaining employees after paying $105 million during the past two months to keep almost 600 workers on the job. 
The former top energy trader paid $50 million in bonuses last month to keep 75 workers, mostly electricity and natural-gas traders, while trying to conclude a merger with rival Dynegy Inc. That's before paying $55 million in bonuses to about 500 employees just ahead of its Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing. 
Enron wants to retain employees needed to keep the trading business operating in hopes it can survive and emerge from Chapter 11 protection, analysts said. 
"It seems logical that they would have to spend to keep key people," said Mike Heim, an A.G. Edwards analyst in St. Louis, Mo. 
Enron spokesperson Mark Palmer, however, said more job cuts are likely at the Houston-based company. 
He declined to comment on how much more Enron might spend on employee retentions. "It depends on what we can work out with the creditors' committee," Palmer said. 
"It's all up to the judge in the end, but usually the judge weighs heavily what the creditors' committee says." 
Enron cut 60 per cent of the 7,500 workers at its Houston headquarters last week, and 1,100 jobs were eliminated in the U.K. Before the company filed for bankruptcy last week, it employed 21,000 people.

I'll attach it again and hopefully you will be able to see it this time.

If not, it is the 60th Anniversary Limited - black exterior with the taupe
and agate interior...I thought it would be a good match for you and there
are only a few around and they are gorgeous.

Strong decade foreseen for real estate 
'Demand for all types of housing is set to surge': Aging Baby Boomers, their children and immigrants to drive residential prices
Paul Vieira 
Financial Post 
The tail end of the Baby Boom generation, along with children of aging boomers and new immigrants to Canada, will keep the residential real estate market strong over the next 10 years, driving the average value of a house up 13%, a new study suggests.
"Demand for all types of housing is set to surge ahead over the coming decade, leading to robust activity, rising prices and a stable investment climate," says the study, jointly written by ReMax Ontario-Atlantic Canada, ReMax Western Canada and Clayton Research.
And Calgary will have the hottest real estate market, with housing prices set to climb 20% to 25% in the next decade, the study says.
Overall, the number of households will increase by 1.5 million over the next 10 years, leading to rising prices for existing homes and steady demand for newly built homes.
Peter Norman, vice-president of Clayton Research, a Toronto-based real estate consulting firm, said the increase will be fuelled by three factors: younger Baby Boomers, between the ages of 35 to 45, who are looking to buy their first home or upgrade from their current residence; the children of the older Boomers, generally 45 to 55, who will be entering the real estate market for the first time; and immigrants.
"Housing prices will remain quite firm over the next 10 years and move up in real terms" Mr. Norman said in an interview.
The combination of high rents and low rental vacancies, particularly in cities such as Toronto and Vancouver, will also help drive the housing market, as will the fact that there has been little or no construction of new rental units.
And mortgage rates are so low that buying is often as financially palatable as renting, Mr. Norman added.
The study concluded that the economy, although in a slump, is in much better shape than it was at the eve of the 1990s recession. Productivity and real income growth have recovered, unemployment is at lower levels than a decade ago, and the country's industrial structure has shifted away from a commodity and manufacturing base, the study said.
"A healthy, long-term economy will boost housing markets by keeping real incomes growing, real interest rates low, and providing confidence in the future performance of real estate assets."
Pamela Alexander, chief executive of ReMax Ontario-Atlantic Canada, said Calgary would be the hottest market in the country thanks to increasing oilpatch activity, migration from other parts of the country and its youthful population.
"Calgary is going through its renaissance period," Ms. Alexander said, adding that its average home price of $180,000 is still 30% to 35% cheaper than Vancouver or Toronto.
Toronto, with its average house price of $250,000, should see growth of 10% to 15%, Ms. Alexander said, because its population is heavily weighted toward 25 to 40 year olds -- who will buy their first home or upgrade -- and because of the scarcity of rental units.
Meanwhile, Ottawa, despite the high-tech downturn, remained one of the hottest housing markets with prices up 10% from a year ago. That market is expected to grow as the federal government increases spending and creates new departments, older civil servants retire and new people are brought in, and the high-tech sector rebounds.

Tych,

Just wondering if you guys have talked to any storage guys in the PNW about storage deals for this Nov to next summer ect. The market is essentially saying that JP storage is worthless for this winter (Nov-Dec) and I don't think that should be the case. I think there is free money on the table for someone like Puget or Avista to roll their scheduled storage withdrawls to next summer. Let me know if you have any thoughts.

John,

Cancelled my trip to Vancouver this weekend. Car I was going to look at sold already. How are things going? Married? I am soo glad to be back in Calgary. I didn't think much of Houston. Life has been pretty boring. Looks like things are going to get busy again. Going to be working for UBS Wharburg Energy. A sub of UBS AG. Should be good. Seems like at great company. AA+ credit will be nice. They have a good risk tolerance and are more or less going to give us limits and let us do our own thing. Hopefully a little more stable than Enron. I think the largest financial instituion in the world should be. Anyway give me a call if you get to Calgary and we will grab some food. 

Take care

Chris

Hi Chris,

I think this is what you were wanting.  The spread graphs can be found in the "spread charts" worksheet.  The data for the charts can be found in the "spread << File: Spreads Data.xls >>  data" tab.

Regards,
Ian

   1999 SURVIVAL GUIDE FOR TAKING A DUMP AT WORK. 
   ESCAPEE 
   Definition: 
     A fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal   or 
   forcing poop in a stall. This is usually  accompanied by a sudden wave 
   of panic/embarrassment.  This is similar to the hot flash you receive 
   when  passing an unseen police car and speeding. If you release an 
   escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen. If you  are 
   standing next to the farter at the urinal, pretend  that you did not 
   hearit. No one likes an escapee, it  is uncomfortable for all involved. 
   Making a joke or  laughing makes both parties feel uneasy. 
   JAILBREAK (Used in conjunction with escapee) 
   Definition: When forcing poop, several farts slip out at a machine  guns 
   pace. This is usually a side effect of diarrhea  or a hangover. If this 
   should happen do not panic,  remain in the stall until everyone has left 
   the  bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just 
   occurred. 
   COURTESY FLUSH 
   Definition: The act of  flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of 
   the  poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an 
   undisclosed location. This reduces the amount of air time the poop  has 
   to stink up the bathroom. This can help you avoid  being caught doing 
   the 
   WALK OF SHAME. 
   WALK OF SHAME 
   Definition: Walking from  the stall, to the sink, to the door after you 
   have  just stunk-up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable 
   moment 
   if someone walks in and busts you. As with all farts, it is  best to 
   pretend that the smell does not exist. Can be  avoided with the use of a 
   COURTESY FLUSH. 
   OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER 
   Definition: A  colleague who poops at work and is damn proud of it. You 
   will often see an Out of the Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with 
   newspaper or magazine under their arm. Always look  around the office 
   for 
   the Out of the Closet pooper  before entering the bathroom. 
   THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (PFN) 
   Definition: A group of coworkers who band together to ensure  emergency 
   pooping goes off without incident. This  group can help you to monitor 
   the whereabouts of OUT  OF THE CLOSET POOPERS and identify SAFE HAVENS. 
   SAFE HAVEN 
   Definition: A seldom used  bathroom somewhere in the building where you 
   can least  expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the 
   opposite sex. This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex 
   entering 
   the bathroom. 
   TURD BURGLAR 
   Definition: A pooper who  does not realize that you are in the stall and 
   tries  to force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and 
   vulnerable moments that occur when taking a dump at work. If  this 
   occurs, remain in the stall until the TURD  BURGLAR leaves. This way you 
   will avoid all  uncomfortable eye contact. 
   CAMO-COUGH 
   Definition: A phony cough  which alerts all new entrants into the 
   bathroom that  you are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a 
   WATERMELON or to alert potential TURD BURGLARS. Very effective when 
   used 
    in 
   conjunction with  an ASTAIRE. 
   ASTAIRE 
   Definition: A subtle toe-tap  that is used to alert potential TURD 
   BURGLARS that you  are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt 
   that 
   the stall is occupied. If you hear an ASTAIRE, leave the  bathroom 
   immediately so the pooper can poop in  peace. 
   WATERMELON 
   Definition: A turd that  creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet 
   water.  This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a WATERMELON 
   coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH. 
   HAVANA OMELET 
   Definition: A load of  diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes 
   in the  toilet water. Often accompanied by an escapee. Try using a 
   CAMO-COUGH with an ASTAIRE. 
   UNCLE TED 
   Definition: A bathroom user  who seems to linger around forever. Could 
   spend  extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the 
   pot. An UNCLE TED makes it difficult to relax while on the  crapper, as 
    you 
   should  always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty.This 
   benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees. 
   FLY BY 
   Definition: The act of scouting  out a bathroom before pooping. Walk in, 
   check for  other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and 
   come back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER.   People may 
   become suspicious if they catch you  constantly going into the bathroom. 
   CRACK WHORE 
   Definition: A crapper that  has seen more ass than a Greyhound Bus. 
   Tell tale  signs of a CRACK WHORE include hairs, stains and streaks. 
   Avoid CRACK WHORES at all cost. Try finding out when the janitor  cleans 
   each particular bathroom. Don't forget with a  good cleaning,a CRACK 
    WHORE 
   can become a SAFE HAVEN.

Check this out!  It's hard, so good luck finding four or five things! 
This is a simple psychoanalytic test to measure your memory. 
Open the first superman picture. 
Memorize it and open the second. 
Without reopening the first try to note each of the differences between the 
two pictures.  There are at least three.  If you can find five or more, you 
are of above average intelligence.

What's going on. When I moved to Houston my e-mail address book got toasted so I am glad you sent your address. What's new? Where are you working now? I am in Houston trading electricity now. I like the job but the city is a dump.

As you know, I gave up  my 3 month vacation as a beach bum a few weeks ago, and have joined the real world again (definately prefer the bum lifestyle!!).   And after a record-breaking move that started at 10pm and ended at 6:00am, I am now settled into a place back on the westside. As always, my door is open (literally), if you are looking for some California sun.

I am guessing that you guys have market knowledge of shut-in costs for western Canada.  We have heard all of the typical low price rumors of Rockies shut-ins at a dollar.  I am going to put Steve South and Paul Lucci in charge of presenting a shut-in analysis by field in the Rockies and san juan.  What do I need to have these guys look at in terms of variable costs.  Is it as simple as gathering and processing?  

Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,
Grigsby

Chris,

Just wanted to touch base before you come down this weekend.  I am going to
Phil's stag in the Shuswap on Friday, but will be coming back on Sunday
around supper time.  Your mom said that you are staying until Monday, so
hopefully you'll be around to go out for supper or grab a movie Sunday night
when I get back.  Good luck house hunting, and I'll give you a phone call on
Sunday on my way home.

Ryan
P.S.  Try to find a place that has a nice guest suite...you know ensuite
with jacuzzi tub etc...

A lucent phone will be fine. I will only be on the desk for about 7-8 days so don't go to too much trouble. Do you have Keith and Frank's flight info for their trip to Calgary on Sept. 7 ? I will be there that weekend as well and want to coordinate my return with theirs.

Thanx,

Hi Chris,

Mike Grigsby has told me that you will be seating with the West Gas Trading Group for a couple of weeks beginning Sept. 1.  Will you be working off of a laptop for those two weeks?  I will make sure that you have the connections you need at the desk you will be sitting at and I will have a lucent phone setup for you.  Please forward me your extension, current location and badge number so I can setup the move.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do for you.  

Will a lucent phone be okay or will you need to be setup on a turret?

Sorry it took so long to get back to you. My boss has been out this week and I am doing both our jobs. Lots of fun. I'm glad you had a good time on your trip.I need a vacation. Are you over your cold yet? It is funny how many people I know have colds in the middle of July. I didn't do anything exciting of the 4th. I watched the NY fireworks on TV. We were on a big gong show weekend the weekend before in Conroe so I needed rest. Better get back but I'll write back later.

Chris

Hey Chris!!  My trip was great.  We had soooo much fun but it flew by.  I
have a good video you will have to watch.  I got back to work last Thursday
and was thrown immediately into a deal that was closing on Friday and to top
it off I wasn't feeling well once I got back here.  I think someone on the
plane was sick and gave me a cold.  So I rested over the weekend and then I
have had a complete week from hell this week.  I have been meaning to touch
base with you!  I didn't even do anything for the 4th of July.  Did you
watch the fireworks??  I was hoping to get out of here early but I don't
think I am going to have that much luck.  I am in town doggie sitting right
now.  I may actually be moving on the 15th of the month back inside the

to come up here.

Crystal,

How was your trip? I was in Lake Conroe last weekend for a work retreat.
We had a great time but I think Austin would have been a better
destination. Susposed to be 95-100 next week but feel like 110 with the
humidity. Can't wait. Take it easy.

Kerrie,

Hope you had a great Christmas. Mine was great. Very low key and relaxing. You missed a great night out in Red Deer on Saturday. High School reunion. Anyway take it easy and give me a call in the New Year and we'll get together for a drink. Below is my new address and phone number.

Subject:	IRS refund cheque--update

Hi Chris,

As promised, I have phoned the IRS today and spoken with a representative
who was able to tell me that the original request for the trace on your
cheque on September 19 was rejected by their system on October 22.  He told
me that he couldn't tell me why because the IRS aren't sure either why the
system rejected it.  As such, a new request for a trace was placed on
October 22 and now the IRS are asking us to wait until December 17.  The
IRS told me that you should receive a letter called a 510C letter from
them.  I have changed your address with the IRS from Texas to Calgary.  I
would ask that when you receive this letter to fax a copy to my attention
at 781-1825 for our files.

I know that this probably isn't the news you were hoping to hear, but at
least it's some news.  I have made a note to follow up with the IRS again
on December 17 and hopefully by then they will have good news in time for
the holidays!

Again, don't hesitate to contact either Judy or myself should you hear
anything further from the IRS, receive your cheque(!) or have any other
questions or concerns.

Kind regards,

Chris... this is the verbatum text from my CFA study material. You might want to cc this to dad as well:
 
1. Analysis of overall performance. How good are professional money managers?
 
- A study by Sharpe found that the average mutual fund manager did as well as the DJIA, but, after expenses, net returns were below those of the DJIA.
- Jensen found that after adjusting for risk the average fund earned about 1.1 percent less than they should have. Mains revised Jensen's study and conclued that fund performance was neutral.
- Carlson and Lehmann/Modest found that performance measurement varied with the index used, but overall, average performance was consistently inferior to the market.
- Cunby/Glen showed that internatinally diversified funds have not beaten the international index after adjustments for risk.
- Blake/Elton/Gruber show that bond mutual funds have not outpermed relevant bond indexes.
 
3. Market timing abilities: Performance can be attributed to security selection or to market timing ability. Can fund mangers time the market, that is, switch to an aggressive posture in advance of market upswings and switch to a conservative posture in advance of market downswings? Academic researchers conclude that there is no evidence to show that managers can time the market. 
 
4. Consistency of performance: Klemkosky concluded that investors should not use past performance to predict short-run future performance. Dunn/Theisen concluded that historical performance should be given little weight when picking a manager.
 
5. What should you derive from this or expect from a fund?
 
- The fund manager should help you determine your risk return preferences and then help you pick a fund that matches them.
- The fund should give you instant diversification.
- The fund should maintain its diversification and keep its risk class constant.
- The fund should try to achieve superior risk adjusted performance.
- The fund should provide you timely information for tax purposes and reinvest your dividends.

I'll keep those suggestions on file. I got him a pretty cool hammock from this Sharper Image type place. Hopefully it will help him relax a little.

I thought you would like it...

It is the end-all be-all of Grand Cherokees.

Retail is $52,300 - your cash price is $45,488 including rebates.

As for Sept 6/7, what I will do is bring down the matching twin of the Jeep
in the Silverstone colour for you to play with.  It is a demo and identical
to the black one other than the exterior colour, so you will be able to see
what you think of it.

How does that sound?

I am going to be moving back to Calgary from Houston in mid september and am looking to buy a loft or condo in the downtown area. I am thinking about 17th ave. and Kensington but I am open to other ideas. I will be in Calgary a couple of times in the next few months and would be interested in getting together to look at properties. If you could send me an e-mail with your contact info. I will call you to arrange an appointment. Thanx for the time.

John,

Here is what I think my out of pocket costs of this move will be:

Movers - $7500 CND
Flight - $1500 CND
Temp. Accomodations - $1500 CND
October Rent - $1500 CND

I am already at $12000 CND and I haven't even got to the car or any incidental costs yet.

Chris

I talked to Milly yesterday, he was ok with the concept of covering the 1 month salary.  I talked to Trish and the easiest/non-tax affected way to handle it is to submit expense forms.  The problem is if you sell the car at a loss, then the loss compensation is tax deductible, if you import the car, then the transport costs/imports duties can be submitted as an expense and is not exposed to taxes. I talked to Trish about exactly what you have proposed and she wasn't sure from an equity standpoint between what was given to other employees that she could do that. However, don't worry about it I'll do my best so that you are kept whole in one way or another.  The easiest position for me to push is if you actually want to keep your car, then you can expense the duty.

John,

Did you have a chance to talk to Dawn / Milly? Even if you want to work the flight / hotel / movers the usual way and then pay the balance as a "signing bonus" or something that would probably work. I am going to take a bath on my car in a big way. The option of moving my it back to Canada is out of the question as I just found out I would have to pay 6.1% import duty, 7% GST and about $400 in excise taxes and permits. Let me know.

If he is in Houston don't count on him doing it. I won't be getting out of here untill tommorow at the earliest and I am thinking it is going to be Friday or Saturday.

Chris,
 
    I will get risk to do that once your book has been completely emptied and all of the deals you have done plus the Station 2- Aeco Spread position has been moved into the book, there is an excel model we can run that dumps all of the deals in the book into a spreadsheet, until then however I will list all of the deals you have done and will send them to you.  Gillis has been in Houston, I am expecting him back today (possibly tomorrow).  
 
Hopes this works.  Let me know if you need anything else.

Could you run a report that shows all the deals in my books (Financial and Gas Daily) as of close of business on Friday (Sept.14). I doubt I will do any trading over the next couple of days but you should probably wait until tommorow afternoon to run it.
 
Thanx,

Thanx for the pos report. Would you mind sending it to me each morning? Also, can you make sure that they have all of the deals (other than the few I have done) transferred out of my book by the end of the week. I talked to Brian? and he said he would look after it but can you make sure it happens.
 
Thanx,

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 
1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 
2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.

Carlos
 
Thanx for the pos report. Would you mind sending it to me each morning? Also, can you make sure that they have all of the deals (other than the few I have done) transferred out of my book by the end of the week. I talked to Brian? and he said he would look after it but can you make sure it happens.
 
Thanx,
 
Chris

Strong decade foreseen for real estate 
'Demand for all types of housing is set to surge': Aging Baby Boomers, their children and immigrants to drive residential prices
Paul Vieira 
Financial Post 
The tail end of the Baby Boom generation, along with children of aging boomers and new immigrants to Canada, will keep the residential real estate market strong over the next 10 years, driving the average value of a house up 13%, a new study suggests.
"Demand for all types of housing is set to surge ahead over the coming decade, leading to robust activity, rising prices and a stable investment climate," says the study, jointly written by ReMax Ontario-Atlantic Canada, ReMax Western Canada and Clayton Research.
And Calgary will have the hottest real estate market, with housing prices set to climb 20% to 25% in the next decade, the study says.
Overall, the number of households will increase by 1.5 million over the next 10 years, leading to rising prices for existing homes and steady demand for newly built homes.
Peter Norman, vice-president of Clayton Research, a Toronto-based real estate consulting firm, said the increase will be fuelled by three factors: younger Baby Boomers, between the ages of 35 to 45, who are looking to buy their first home or upgrade from their current residence; the children of the older Boomers, generally 45 to 55, who will be entering the real estate market for the first time; and immigrants.
"Housing prices will remain quite firm over the next 10 years and move up in real terms" Mr. Norman said in an interview.
The combination of high rents and low rental vacancies, particularly in cities such as Toronto and Vancouver, will also help drive the housing market, as will the fact that there has been little or no construction of new rental units.
And mortgage rates are so low that buying is often as financially palatable as renting, Mr. Norman added.
The study concluded that the economy, although in a slump, is in much better shape than it was at the eve of the 1990s recession. Productivity and real income growth have recovered, unemployment is at lower levels than a decade ago, and the country's industrial structure has shifted away from a commodity and manufacturing base, the study said.
"A healthy, long-term economy will boost housing markets by keeping real incomes growing, real interest rates low, and providing confidence in the future performance of real estate assets."
Pamela Alexander, chief executive of ReMax Ontario-Atlantic Canada, said Calgary would be the hottest market in the country thanks to increasing oilpatch activity, migration from other parts of the country and its youthful population.
"Calgary is going through its renaissance period," Ms. Alexander said, adding that its average home price of $180,000 is still 30% to 35% cheaper than Vancouver or Toronto.
Toronto, with its average house price of $250,000, should see growth of 10% to 15%, Ms. Alexander said, because its population is heavily weighted toward 25 to 40 year olds -- who will buy their first home or upgrade -- and because of the scarcity of rental units.
Meanwhile, Ottawa, despite the high-tech downturn, remained one of the hottest housing markets with prices up 10% from a year ago. That market is expected to grow as the federal government increases spending and creates new departments, older civil servants retire and new people are brought in, and the high-tech sector rebounds.

Tamara,

Any updates on my IRS refund? Also I need a contact for my 2001 returns. As I will now be working for UBS I will probably be paying privately to have my return done but I would still like PWC to do both my US and Canadian returns for 2001. Please advise.

Hi Chris!

I followed up with the same IRS representative I spoke with in November
regarding your missing cheque.  I wish I had better news for the holiday
season.

Three traces were placed on your missing refund cheque and three times the
trace has been rejected.  The IRS doesn't know why.  They are placing a
formal inquiry into the matter.  The representative I spoke with has
admitted that somebody on the IRS' end isn't doing what they are supposed
to be doing and he promised me they'd get down to the matter.  I can only
tell you that I will follow up again in January of the new year.

In the meantime, have a very Merry Holiday Season and a Wonderful New Year!

Best regards,

The bonus structure was lined out in detail in a couple of HR video conferences we had with Houston. It is about 10X better than enrons.

Hey,

Does their description of the bonus structure concern you at all...may be payable, in part, in an equity award pursuant to the Firm's programs or plans. There is no choice like at Enron.

Let me know what you think,

I am moving to Calgary from Houston and am wondering if Lexus has a winter wheel/tire package for the 2001 IS 300. If not could you recommend a wheel / tire dealer in Calgary who could help me find something that would work. Thanx for your time.

Crystal,

Scott is off to Dallas for the weekend but I think I can swing checking out a game on Friday. How many people? I'll try to find some Enron tickets. Let me know...

Mohammad,

What's going on? Hope all you exams went well. Are you coming home for the holidays? If so give me a shout in the office, at home or in Red Deer. Things are a little nuts around here but everything with me is fine and I have a few alternatives to consider. All the best to you and your family.

Chris

What's up? Good to hear from you. I am very happily back in Calgary. Things
at Enron are totally fucked up right now. Not really sure how it is going
to play out. Anyway life goes on. Tell D'arcy I made less than 10 million
last year. Take it easy and I'll right more later.

   Hey Chris,

   How are you doing?  How are things at Enron.  I was shocked to see the
   stock
   price today.

   Are you back in Calgary or still in Houston?

   Let me know, are you coming to visit.  Do I have stories for you!!!

   Speak to you soon,

   Mohammad

Don't forget pink fuzzy dice and chain steering wheel and red interior lights. Chicks are going to love it. I'm going to get a chick with a python wrapped around her painted on the side and get those tires that stick out 6 inches from the wheel wells with gold plated rims. SWEET! The funny thing is that in some neighborhoods in Houston (predominately latin) that would be a killer ride.

What's up? I am still not doing much at work. Waiting for the UBS deal to be finalized and then it is back to work. Really excited for that too happen. You can only surf the net for so long. Kerri's wedding will be fun. Where are they having it? The round-up center or something. Not sure where that is. Hope all is well. Talk to you soon.

Absolutely.  When is you term date here in the USA so I can use this date to run the calculation?

Also, here is the information you requested

401k

When you return to Canada, you can either roll over your 401k to qualified IRA or you can request a distribution from Northern Trust. If you choose to receive the distribution, you will be taxed 20% Federal and then 10% penalty.  Northern Trust @ 800-316-7526

The Cash Balance Plan

If you are vested (at least 5 years with the company) you would be eligilbe for a distribution.  If you go to the HR Web page,
click on Benefits, A New Look For  Benefits, Pension Plan.  Then you will need to type in your ss# and pin  (which is the last four digits of your ss#)  It will lead you to a place where you could see how to calculate this figure.  You can request a distribution by calling x37979  then press Option 2 Cash  Balance Plan.

Hi

Sorry if I blew your party girl cover with one of your colleauges. Cooper and I were out on one of our many walks and I thought I would say hi. Hope you are feeling better now. Saturday was fun. I shouldn't have gone to the bar. Ended up losing Max at the drink and going home. He was on a rant about his girlfriend and how women are all screwed up. I imagine he picked up some lonely girl. I would love to do lunch one day next week. Let me know when is good for you and if you like sushi. Take it easy.

Hi Chris, how's it going? I heard you stopped by yesterday but I wasn't
here...I was actually sick! Not still recovering from Saturday, I try to
keep my weekend binges on the lowdown here, not that they believe me but
I try.
Did you have fun Saturday? How was Crazy Horse? I actually had the same
cabbie as you guys who drove me home, he said he picked up 2 guys that
seemed to be angry with women and looking to go out on the town! That's
not how I figured it out...he said he picked you guys up at the same
house.
We'll have to make plans to go for lunch sometime soon. My work # is

Talk to you soon,
Leslie

Mike

I provided that level of detail for calgary trading and marketing. I haven't seen the file Richard Mckeel created so I wouldn't know what is in it. Seems like we have about 3 different people working on the same project. So my answer is I don't know.

Hi Traci,

I had a very relaxing weekend. Slept 10 hours both nights. Worked out and chilled. Very good weekend except for the weather. No worries about Friday. The highways were ridiculous. My brother is coming to town on Thursday for a week. It will be good to see him. I am planning on being in Red Deer on the weekend of the 8th. Maybe we can get together then. Let me know if you are free.Have a great week and I will speak to you soon!

Chris

I hear your sister is looking for a piece of action so I thought you might tell her about the kid.

Graduated in 1997 with an HBA from The Richard Ivey School of Business (University of Western Ontario)

Started at Enron in may 97 as an analyst in the trading group working for Lavorato doing fundament analysis and acting as Lavo's trading assistant (slave)

Started out trading BC Cash desk in June of 98.

Moved over to trade short term Aeco in Sept 99. Did that for a year. Mike McDermott and Laird can let you know if I was any good.

Went to Houston in Sept 2000 to trade east power. Traded Cinergy cash desk and worked next to Fletch Sturm (Cinergy Term Trader) for a year. Learned a little bit about trading from him.

You know the rest.

What are her measurements again. 26 36 26

Can that be right?

            would have to pay $2000 USD to move it plus 6.1% of KBB value
   in
         import
            duty plus 7% GST plus $200 excise tax plus about $400 in
   permits.
         Looks
            like I am looking for a new car as well.

Dec. 12, 01:00 EDT Toronto real estate seen as solid value 
15% to 20% increase in equity expected over next 10 years
Tony Wong
business reporter
	
Worried about what your home will be worth 10 years from now if you buy it today? 
After deducting inflation, the average Toronto home should be worth anywhere from 15 per cent to 20 per cent more over the next decade, says a study released yesterday. 
Resale values for a Toronto home should do better than the national average, with a solid - although unspectacular - gain in equity, once inflation is factored in. That conclusion comes from research by real estate analysts Clayton Research Associates Ltd. in conjunction with ReMax Ontario-Atlantic Canada and ReMax of Western Canada. "Toronto will remain the rock of Gibraltar, showing decent, steady gains over the next decade," says Pamela Alexander, chief executive of ReMax Ontario-Atlantic Canada. 
Given that capital gains on a principal home are not taxable, that means an average gain in equity to the Toronto homeowner of 1.5 to 2 per cent every year over the next decade. That might be nothing to do cartwheels over, but it's a relatively comfortable return considering the meltdown in the equity markets. Across Canada, the average home is expected to increase by about 13 per cent in 10 years. 
"I've always said real estate is investment for dummies. You pay your mortgage, have someplace to live and you own a home in 25 years. It's not spectacular stuff, but you do come out ahead," says Alexander. 
That was not the case in the previous decade, however. From 1991 to 2001, home prices increased by only 9 per cent, from an average of $234,313 in 1991, to a forecasted $255,000 by the end of this year. If you factor in inflation, you'd be getting a negative return on your investment. 
However, Clayton Research says the next decade will be different than the last, primarily because: 
Demand for home ownership will remain elevated due to the low vacancy rates in Toronto rental accommodation. 
About half of Canada's international migration is destined for Toronto, which will boost population growth and first-time buyer demand. 
While the present economic slowdown is taking a toll on the Toronto economy, the medium-term outlook for Toronto is favourable. 
Canada-wide, the number of households is expected to expand by another 1.5 million over the next 10 years. 
While homes in Toronto, Ottawa and Kitchener-Waterloo are expected to post gains of 15 per cent to 20 per cent over the next decade, Calgary is forecast to lead the country in terms of appreciating housing values of between 20 per cent and 25 per cent. 
Clayton Research says the most significant event driving the housing market will continue to be demographic. The post-war generation born between 1946 and 1966 is moving into prime homeownership years. 
The youngest members of the group are 35 years old and will be 45 in 2011. According to census figures, people older than 45 are about 15 per cent more likely to own a home than people between 35 and 45. They are also set to inherit considerable wealth from their parents, a factor expected to affect their housing choices. 
On the other end of the market, the 20 to 35 age group is also expected to see a significant upswing, which means more people buying starter homes. Despite the lust we see for condominiums today, the study says that single detached homes will be the most popular dwelling of choice. 
"The traditional single detached home will be in strongest demand over the coming decade" representing 60 per cent of net new households. Condominiums and apartments will still see healthy demand.

Carlos,
 
Could you run a report that shows all the deals in my books (Financial and Gas Daily) as of close of business on Friday (Sept.14). I doubt I will do any trading over the next couple of days but you should probably wait until tommorow afternoon to run it.
 
Thanx,
 
Chris

Thanx for the pos report. Would you mind sending it to me each morning? Also, can you make sure that they have all of the deals (other than the few I have done) transferred out of my book by the end of the week. I talked to Brian? and he said he would look after it but can you make sure it happens.
 
Thanx,

Linda,

I found your email address on the internet so disregard the message I left on your cell. The following properties are the type of place I have in mind. I thought that these would give you a better idea the general concept I am looking for. I am starting to think that a townhouse / infill is a better way to go as opposed to an apartement style condo. I look forward to meeting you on Friday. Below are some MLS #'s of properties that interested me and my contact # in Red Deer / Calary.

Thanx

I had asked that it be delivered to you by hand before I left Thursday.  Apparently, they tried a few times but I asked Ben to only hand it to you.  We will bring it down today.

What are you driving these days? I'm selling my car cheap because it will cost me a fortune to take it back to Canada. 2001 Lexus IS 300 Silver with Black leather interior. Totally loaded with 3800 miles on it. Let me know if you or any of your buddies want to check it out.

I briefly scanned the contract you delivered this morning and it appears fine except for the salary listed in exhibit A (US salary but in CND dollars) which is incorrect. As I will be in Calgary in Monday the corrected version should probably just be sent to Dawn. 

Thanx

Hi everyone!

Once again I find myself being tasked by Geof Storey. Houston has requested that we make lists of all applications that we use and also that we consolidate all of the files (models and data) that are critical to our business (I don't think MP3's count) into one directory on the network. This is so that these items can be included in the proposed deal with newco. The Calgary Trading group has set up a directory on I:/trading/newco and I think if each group did the same that would be great. Each group should probably have one person in charge of the directory so there isn't any overlap. Call me with any ?'s/

Thanx 

Chris

What's going on? I hope school is going well. I am sure you have heard but things are getting back to normal around here. I think working for UBS is going to be really good. Seems like the cultures are going to mix really well. I am thinking about buying a porsche. I really like the 993's but I don't really like the 996's. Looking around for a nice low km 1994-97 C4. Anyway don't work too hard and keep in touch.

Hi Chris,

Just a note to let you know that a tax equalization calculation will not be
prepared for you,,,, in case you were unsure.  This means that the refund
owing to you on the US return is 100% yours - which is good news, right?

Tricia,

Have you looked in to the stock option line item on my pay stub yet? The number on the stub is about 36000 and I think about 18000 is accurate.

I don't think the machine that I use for ICE has been upgraded to windows 2000. There is no business applications selection under start>>programs>>on this machine.

Kerrie,

Congratulations! I actually heard the big news last week from Jill (of course) but I have been meaning to drop you a line. I was in town last weekend for Matt and Jen's wedding and while I was there I bought a house in Calgary. I'm moving back on September 15th to trade gas again for Enron. One again congrats and I'll give you a call when I get back to town.

I hope all is well.

Chris buddy!  How's it going?  I was chatting with Dan this morning and
I was able to track down your mailing address, so I can send you a
wedding invitation.  You're still M.C. right?  Just kidding, but it'll
be good to see you.  I hear everything's going good down there, speaking
for the rest of your buddies up north though, I'll be looking forward to
when that career path steers you back a little closer to home.  The
wedding is on August 18th(saturday), Mike & Nate are planning some golf,
camping and a little drinking as well on the August long weekend too if
you were planning on being back then as well, although that sounds like
a lot of travel.  Anyways, I suppose II'll see you at Sue and Dionne's
wedding?  Should be a good time.  Take it easy, Chris.

Brad,

Any progress on the direct line with the west desk? If we need to use a different circuit or something let me know. I called Mike Grigsby and asked him to look into it on his end. It is important that we get this line working as soon as possible. 

Chris

Dwayne,

As you can Imagine things in the US have been a little crazy which is why I haven't gotten back to you untill now. I will hopefully be in Calgary on Monday and will give you a call then. My office number in Calgary is 974-6910. Are the windows on that truck tinted?

I thought you would like it...

It is the end-all be-all of Grand Cherokees.

Retail is $52,300 - your cash price is $45,488 including rebates.

As for Sept 6/7, what I will do is bring down the matching twin of the Jeep
in the Silverstone colour for you to play with.  It is a demo and identical
to the black one other than the exterior colour, so you will be able to see
what you think of it.

How does that sound?

Congrats on the CFA. I am actually fighting back today. How much time a week would you say you spend on yard work? I am thinking that I will go with a place more like yours. Let me know what you think. I am going to have to get Monica back.

I thought you would like it...

It is the end-all be-all of Grand Cherokees.

Retail is $52,300 - your cash price is $45,488 including rebates.

As for Sept 6/7, what I will do is bring down the matching twin of the Jeep
in the Silverstone colour for you to play with.  It is a demo and identical
to the black one other than the exterior colour, so you will be able to see
what you think of it.

How does that sound?

Mike, 

I wish I was there to witness Dan in action. I will be next year for sure. Can't wait to see Johnny. Hopefully there are some single hotties at the wedding. There hasn't been a cougar sighting recently. Better hop. Talk to you later...

Things are good.  I am going out for lunch today with our corporate finance group.  I'm thinking of moving down there.  The wedding should be a gong show.  Golf trip to BC was amazing!  Greywolf is quite a track.  How's the stalker?  Still phoning in the odd booty call?  I'm back with mine.....I'm weak.   Good to see your bro - he did some vintage "wheeling" when he was down, it was sweet.  Take care, see you soon.  Johnnie says hi and he is looking forward to seeing you.  Later

Subject:	RE: Critical Applications, Models and Data

Chris - In order that we are able to set up the transfer of files in an orderly fashion and, more importantly,  maintain security protections for certain directories (e.g. legal) I believe a better approach is to replicate our existing directory tree structure under a new I:/Newco/ directory.  At this level we can then break things out into the required subfolders (e.g. accounting, trading, legal, ...). 

In this regard we have set up the I:/Newco/ directory and started to create subfolders. I ask everyone who has put information in the I:/trading/newco directory to move it to  I:/Newco/ under their applicable subdirectory (which may need to be created).  I apologize that this is a hassle for those who have already transfered files.

If you have any concerns please let me know.

Regards
Chris

Hi everyone!

Once again I find myself being tasked by Geof Storey. Houston has requested that we make lists of all applications that we use and also that we consolidate all of the files (models and data) that are critical to our business (I don't think MP3's count) into one directory on the network. This is so that these items can be included in the proposed deal with newco. The Calgary Trading group has set up a directory on I:/trading/newco and I think if each group did the same that would be great. Each group should probably have one person in charge of the directory so there isn't any overlap. Call me with any ?'s/

Thanx 

Chris

Kim,
 
I just wanted to touch base with you and let you know my schedule. I am in the Houston office this week from Monday to Thursday but I will be in and out quite a bit meeting with movers and clearing up loose ends. If we need to get together before I go we should probably plan to do so Monday or Tuesday as I will be packing and moving much of Wednesday and Thursday. Let me know when you would like to get together. I am sitting at 3208b.
 
Thanx
 
Chris

You actually passed her when you walked out. You have to remind me about that stuff, otherwise I'll forget. She's wearing a pinkish shirt today, but she might have had a jacket on when you passed her. She saw you at the very last second so you maybe didn't see her. As you can tell...I don't matchmake very pro-actively.
You'll have to come back again.

            Close to downtown. I am thinking infill / townhouse. My mom has
   a
         friend
            who says there are nice brownstone townhomes in Altadore. I am
         thinking
            of
            checking those out. I am looking for minimal maintenance. Do
   you
      have
            any
            ideas? Seen Kerri Murray lately?

Good morning Chris...

Actually, I was just out of the office most of yesterday and hadn't had a
chance to do your lease numbers, but I guess the lease isn't an issue
anymore...

By the way, if you are having grief selling your car, let me know - I can
post it on MegaWheels for you for free.  It's amazing how fast cars sell on
their website.

Anyway, if you need anything at all, let me know as I will be on the
computer all day today so I will be available right away.

Dwayne

Chris, sorry I didn't get back to you sooner.  As you know by now, the plane to Portland didn't happen.  I ended up driving to Salt Lake City and flying to Portland (I left Houston on Wednesday night and got in to Portland late Thursday night).  I hope you were successful in getting back to Calgary.  Regards, Wayne.

Wayne,

I was talking to Kevin Presto and he mentioned that you have a plane going to Portland. I need to get to Calgary and Kevin suggested I look into catching a ride with you and getting them to swing north and drop me off on their way back. Can you let me know when you plan to leave and if it isn't an inconvience I will talk to Lavo and see if he is OK with it.

Thanx

Rod,

What do you think of the Canadian bank stocks? Relative to their US counterparts they seem cheap. I know that the discount is due regulation (no take overs or mergers) but in a 4% interest rate environment a 4% dividend yield looks pretty attractive. Not to mention they continue to crank out earnings quarter after quarter.

What's up? I nearly drowned on the way home the other day. Beautiful weather we're having. Are you feeling better? I got a cold but I feel better today. The trick is getting 10 hours of sleep a night. Tonight is the MTV movie awards. I really need to get a life. I mentioned the party to Rob but he forgot to ask Darlene. I'll let you know if they are coming tommorow. Talk to you later.

Hi, Chris,

I am just wondering if you had received my fax from last week regarding the
Power of Attorney form (Form 2848).

Friday, Oct. 5th will be my last day at PwC, and I just wanted to follow-up
with you on this matter before I leave.  If you do not get a chance to fax
the form back to me before then, or if you have any other concerns, please
contact Judy Perdomo @ (403) 509-7470 after next Friday and she will be
happy to assist you.

Best regards,

Vicki Meszaros

1999 SURVIVAL GUIDE FOR TAKING A DUMP AT WORK. 
ESCAPEE 
Definition: 
  A fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal   or 
forcing poop in a stall. This is usually  accompanied by a sudden wave 
of panic/embarrassment.  This is similar to the hot flash you receive 
when  passing an unseen police car and speeding. If you release an 
escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen. If you  are 
standing next to the farter at the urinal, pretend  that you did not 
hearit. No one likes an escapee, it  is uncomfortable for all involved. 
Making a joke or  laughing makes both parties feel uneasy. 
JAILBREAK (Used in conjunction with escapee) 
Definition: When forcing poop, several farts slip out at a machine  guns 
pace. This is usually a side effect of diarrhea  or a hangover. If this 
should happen do not panic,  remain in the stall until everyone has left 
the  bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred.  
COURTESY FLUSH 
Definition: The act of  flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of 
the  poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an 
undisclosed location. This reduces the amount of air time the poop  has 
to stink up the bathroom. This can help you avoid  being caught doing the 
WALK OF SHAME. 
WALK OF SHAME 
Definition: Walking from  the stall, to the sink, to the door after you 
have  just stunk-up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment  
if someone walks in and busts you. As with all farts, it is  best to 
pretend that the smell does not exist. Can be  avoided with the use of a 
COURTESY FLUSH. 
OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER 
Definition: A  colleague who poops at work and is damn proud of it. You 
will often see an Out of the Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with   
newspaper or magazine under their arm. Always look  around the office for 
the Out of the Closet pooper  before entering the bathroom. 
THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (PFN) 
Definition: A group of coworkers who band together to ensure  emergency 
pooping goes off without incident. This  group can help you to monitor 
the whereabouts of OUT  OF THE CLOSET POOPERS and identify SAFE HAVENS. 
SAFE HAVEN 
Definition: A seldom used  bathroom somewhere in the building where you 
can least  expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the 
opposite sex. This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex  entering 
the bathroom. 
TURD BURGLAR 
Definition: A pooper who  does not realize that you are in the stall and 
tries  to force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and 
vulnerable moments that occur when taking a dump at work. If  this 
occurs, remain in the stall until the TURD  BURGLAR leaves. This way you 
will avoid all  uncomfortable eye contact. 
CAMO-COUGH 
Definition: A phony cough  which alerts all new entrants into the 
bathroom that  you are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a 
WATERMELON or to alert potential TURD BURGLARS. Very effective when  used 
 in 
conjunction with  an ASTAIRE. 
ASTAIRE 
Definition: A subtle toe-tap  that is used to alert potential TURD 
BURGLARS that you  are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that 
the stall is occupied. If you hear an ASTAIRE, leave the  bathroom 
immediately so the pooper can poop in  peace. 
WATERMELON 
Definition: A turd that  creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet 
water.  This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a WATERMELON  
coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH. 
HAVANA OMELET 
Definition: A load of  diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes 
in the  toilet water. Often accompanied by an escapee. Try using a 
CAMO-COUGH with an ASTAIRE. 
UNCLE TED 
Definition: A bathroom user  who seems to linger around forever. Could 
spend  extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the  
pot. An UNCLE TED makes it difficult to relax while on the  crapper, as 
 you 
should  always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty.This 
benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees. 
FLY BY 
Definition: The act of scouting  out a bathroom before pooping. Walk in, 
check for  other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and 
come back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER.   People may 
become suspicious if they catch you  constantly going into the bathroom. 
CRACK WHORE 
Definition: A crapper that  has seen more ass than a Greyhound Bus. 
Tell tale  signs of a CRACK WHORE include hairs, stains and streaks. 
Avoid CRACK WHORES at all cost. Try finding out when the janitor  cleans 
each particular bathroom. Don't forget with a  good cleaning,a CRACK 
 WHORE 
can become a SAFE HAVEN.

Laura,

I don't know if you have heard but I am moving back to Calgary to trade gas. I am coming back in mid-september. Would you do a USD/CND currency swap for me when I get back? I would like to avoid the Royal Bank's huge bid / offer spread. Let me know. 

Thanx

Chris

Hi Chris,

So you like black?  Oddly enough that was the one I was thinking of too...

Here's a picture...What do you think?

By the way, I will be here on the 6th and 7th, so I will see you then.

Take care,

Ryan,

Sorry I haven't gotten back to you. As you can Imagine things around here have been a little nuts. Just wanted to drop you a line and say hi. Everything with me is fine and I have several options in front of me. The next few months will probably be pretty frustrating but I am confident everything will work out in the end. As far a snowboarding I'm not sure if I am going to be able to get out before christmas. I am coming to Red Deer on Saturday for the night and will pick up my board but the girl I am seeing is going home for XMas on the 20th and I think it would be bad if I made plans to going skiing next weekend. Hope all is good with you and I'll talk to you soon. Are you going to be in Red Deer this weekend? If so let me know and I will give you a call.

   I slept (was passed out) through the whole thing. My car is on the 4th 
   floor of the parkade so luckily it was fine. I love the MTV movie 
   awards. 
   Shannon Elizabeth rules. Halle Berry naked in Swordfish. Can't wait. 
   What's

I checked out the whiskey on Saturday. Pretty cool club but the music has to go. And the whole no one under 35 policy really detracts from the talent. Mike is coming to town on Saturday and we are going to hit the town. Talk to you later. I have an excellent instilling jealous rage in the ex story for you but I'll save it to tell you in person.

I have spoken with Nella Cappelletto and Human Resources regarding your concerns parking at the Westin Hotel.

John,

I talked to Fletch yesterday and I think I am going to come back to Calgary. I'll give you a call this afternoon or Monday to talk about details but I just thought I would drop you a note so you could get the ball rolling with HR on your end. Talk to you soon.

I bought a brownstone in the River Park / Altadore area. #402 3511 14a St. SW. A really cool area and a great place. We will have to grab some sushi and catch up when I get back.

Talk to you soon.

Kerrie,

Congratulations! I actually heard the big news last week from Jill (of
course) but I have been meaning to drop you a line. I was in town last
weekend for Matt and Jen's wedding and while I was there I bought a house
in Calgary. I'm moving back on September 15th to trade gas again for Enron.
One again congrats and I'll give you a call when I get back to town.

Hi Chris, yeah I'll be around this weekend and likely up for a drink or two. As long as you don't keep spreading my weekend parties around my office! Just kidding. I actually got an email from Steph at the same time as you telling me about Dan so I don't know who else I would talk to that would care, but I can give it a shot.
Oh yeah...as for the girl I was thinking I should set you up with, she was away last week when you came in but if you're ever wandering around, she sits in the second office in that's behind you when you are standing at the reception desk, her name is Tina and she's one of our financial advisors, really cute & really nice. So you can come check her out and of course stop by and say hi to me.
I'll see you Saturday, if not sooner.
Leslie

Dawn,

I got your package yesterday and I signed the offer letter and will return it today. I wasn't sure what to do about the employment agreement because I signed a 2 year contract in April that is a little more detailed and restrictive that the one you sent. The main differences are with regards to the non-compete agreement (3.4) and termination before end of term (2.1). If you want I can include a copy of that contract with the offer letter. Let me know what you want me to do.

Thanx

Chris

A woman has been married to her husband for 30 years. Their sex life has
become really dull.  So one day she decides to spice things up by purchasing
a pair of crotchless panties.  One night while her husband was watching TV,
she put on her crotchless panties and hiked her leg up on the TV.

"Do you want some of this?" she asked her husband.

But he replied, "Hell no, look what it did to your panties!"

Hi Chris,

We have done a cash allocation of $7011.69 that was sitting in your RRSP as
cash.  I will fax you the form to sign and you can fax it back to me.  There is
also $3570.89 cash sitting in your Locked-In RSP- we will allocate that near
the end of the month when a new fund from Mackenzie is released- Brad wants to
put some of this $ into it (Growth Trends).  Please e-mail a good time to fax
this to you so it is not laying around the office at your end.  Thanks.

Lee

I have talked to Sierra Pacific and they have some storage... I will advise.

I think fuller was doing some leg work also.

Do you think there are any displacement issues that they may be forced to adhere to that would no allow them to shift flows?

Also, are you able to replicate the delivery point off of JP to make this happen?

Tych,

Just wondering if you guys have talked to any storage guys in the PNW about storage deals for this Nov to next summer ect. The market is essentially saying that JP storage is worthless for this winter (Nov-Dec) and I don't think that should be the case. I think there is free money on the table for someone like Puget or Avista to roll their scheduled storage withdrawls to next summer. Let me know if you have any thoughts.

Chris

Grigs,

I talked to Lambie (our resident produciton and reserve expert) about this and he thought it was highly unlikely that producers would shut in eastern rocks production for a couple of reasons. Apparently, if you shut in coal bed methane production there is a serious risk that the well will "water out" either ruining the well or causing 6 months to a year of production delays. Also, it seem logistically unlikely due to the small production volumes associated with each individual well (100-500 mm/d). In Chris's opinion coal bed methane would be some of the last production we would ever see shut in. Hope this helps. Let me know if you learn anything further.

Subject:	Shut - In costs

I am guessing that you guys have market knowledge of shut-in costs for western Canada.  We have heard all of the typical low price rumors of Rockies shut-ins at a dollar.  I am going to put Steve South and Paul Lucci in charge of presenting a shut-in analysis by field in the Rockies and san juan.  What do I need to have these guys look at in terms of variable costs.  Is it as simple as gathering and processing?  

Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,
Grigsby

Tricia,

I have already spoken to the RIV and Canada Customs. My car was manufactured in Japan and thus would be subject to an import duty of 6.1%, the GST and excise and import costs.

Purchase price = 35000 USD = 54000 CND
Duty on this amount = 3300
GST on this amount = 3800
Excise tax = 180
Permits = 400

Plus costs to convert the speedometer and odometer to the metric system and label all safety systems with french language instructions (from RIV) = approx. 500

That brings us to $8200 CND plus the cost to actually transport it from Houston to Calgary (at least $2000). Total approximately $10000 CND.

Hardly seems like the best option.

Also, I called Williams moving to find out what the cost was to move me down here last year. And the invoice just for the move of my household goods from Calgary to Houston was $4700 USD. Just off the top of my head my out of pocket costs will be:

Movers = $7300 CND (4700 USD)
Flight = $1500 CND
Hotel = $1500 CND
October Rent = $1500 (I have a 1 year lease in Houston that expires at the end of October)

The total of the above is $11 800.

Hi Chris.  I have some information for you about how to bring your car into Canada.  You'll have to do a little leg work, but you will get the  answers you're looking for.

First thing... call the Registrar of Imported Vehicles (RIV) here in Canada (1-888-848-8240 toll free U.S. & Canada).    You'll need the make, model, year, and original purchase price of your car.   This agency will tell you if your car is eligible for import and what if any modifications are required.    Costs associated with this can be reimbursed under your relocation package.

Generally you do not have to pay duty on the car if it originates from the U.S.    You'll have to pay 7% GST on the purchase value (less depreciation if you've had the car more than 30 days) converted into CAD$ using the f/x rate on the date of import.  There are some excise taxes for having an air conditioner ($100) or for a vehicle weighing more than 4,425 pounds.  Costs associated with this can be reimbursed under your relocation package.

Once you have an estimate of the costs for bringing your car here please let us know in case your relocation budget needs to be reviewed.


 << File: Importing a Vehicle.pdf >>   This document explains the process in more detail and has an example of the cost calculation.

Talk to you later,

>>(And it's a true story...)  
>>  
>>On a recent weekend in Atlantic City, a woman won a  
>>bucketful of quarters at a slot machine. She took a  
>>break from the slots for dinner with her husband in the  
>>hotel dining room. But first she wanted to stash the  
>>quarters in her room. "I'll be right back and we'll go  
>>to eat," she told her husband and carried the coin-laden  
>>bucket to the elevator.  
>>  
>>As she was about to walk into the elevator she noticed  
>>two men already aboard. Both were black. One of them was  
>>tall...very tall...an intimidating figure. The woman  
>>froze. Her first thought was: These two are going to rob  
>>me. Her next thought was: Don't be a bigot; they look  
>>like perfectly nice gentlemen. But racial stereotypes  
>>are powerful and fear immobilized her.  
>>  
>>She stood and stared at the two men. She felt anxious,  
>>flustered and ashamed. She hoped they didn't read her  
>>mind but Gosh; they had to know what she was thinking!!!  
>>Her hesitation about joining them in the elevator was  
>>all too obvious now. Her face was flushed. She couldn't  
>>just stand there, so with a mighty effort of will she  
>>picked up one foot and stepped forward and followed with  
>>the other foot and was on the elevator. Avoiding eye  
>>contact, she turned around stiffly and faced the  
>>elevator doors as they closed. A second passed, and then  
>>another second, and then another. Her fear increased!  
>>The elevator didn't move. Panic consumed her. My God,  
>>she thought, I'm trapped and about to be robbed!  
>>  
>>Her heart plummeted. Perspiration poured from every  
>>pore. Then one of the men said, "Hit the floor."  
>>Instinct told her to do what they told her. The bucket  
>>of quarters flew upwards as she threw out her arms and  
>>dove to the elevator floor. A shower of coins  
>>rained down on her. Take my money and spare me, she prayed.  
>>  
>>More seconds passed. She heard one of the men say  
>>politely, "Ma'am, if you'll just tell us what floor  
>>you're going to, we'll push the button." The one who  
>>said it had a little trouble getting the words out. He  
>>was trying mightily to hold in a belly laugh. The woman  
>>lifted her head and looked up at the two men. They  
>>reached down to help her up. Confused, she struggled to  
>>her feet. "When I told my friend here to hit the  
>>floor," said the average sized one, "I meant that he  
>>should hit the elevator button for our floor. I didn't  
>>mean for you to actually hit the floor, ma'am."  
>>  
>>He spoke genially. He bit his lip. It was obvious he was  
>>having a hard time not laughing. The woman thought: My  
>>God, what a spectacle I've made of myself. She was  
>>humiliated to speak. She wanted to blurt out an apology,  
>>but words failed her. How do you apologize to two  
>>perfectly respectable gentlemen for behaving as though  
>>they were going to rob you? She didn't know what to say.  
>>The three of them gathered up the strewn quarters and  
>>refilled her bucket.  
>>  
>>When the elevator arrived at her floor they then  
>>insisted on walking her to her room. She seemed a little  
>>unsteady on her feet, and they were afraid she might not  
>>make it down the corridor.  
>>  
>>At her door they bid her a good evening. As she slipped  
>>into her room she could hear them roaring with laughter  
>>as they walked back to the elevator. The woman brushed

>>downstairs for dinner with her husband.  
>>  
>>The next morning flowers were delivered to her room

ich I said, "Yes, of  course I'm serious - you should have heard the great =
things Chris and Dan said  about their Mom!"  Well, he didn't let me down..=
...and then I had a few  more tears!  You guys did a great job with your pa=
rt of the video and I was  proud of you.
=20
Well, we are going through some major  changes here as I'm sure you know.  =
We took possession of our new "Red  Deer" home on June 1st and the first th=
ing we did was get Gunner in to install  hardwood flooring.  They just fini=
shed yesterday and it is awesome!   Originally there was hardwood in the fr=
ont entrance way, but we had that all  refinished to match the new stuff th=
at we had installed in the family room,  kitchen, and atrium.  I just love =
it!
=20
Today we meet the painter there and  choose colours and she will get starte=
d on Tuesday.  We'll have the whole  house painted pretty much and then we =
can start shuffling our "stuff" from here  to there.  It's quite overwhelmi=
ng moving everything from a barn, two  oversize double garages and this hou=
se into the city.  We had all the "farm  stuff" to sell and dispose of and =
that is pretty much all done now.  Dave's  tractor was his pool table fund =
and it just sold a week or so ago, so off to Red  Deer Billiards to purchas=
e the pool table.  He is having snooker rails put  on - I guess that's what=
 your folks have too, isn't it?  They tell me it's  harder to play and that=
 I should get practised up at home and then hit the bars,  challenge the un=
suspecting to a game of eight ball and then whoop their butts  (because I'd=
 be so incredibly good after practising on the snooker table).   Makes me l=
augh!  I'm pretty positive challenging anyone for a game would be  a joke o=
n my part, but hopefully I can get into "pool" mode and have fun with it  t=
oo.
=20
The yard at our new home is just  incredible compared to most Red Deer yard=
s.  The home is on a huge pie  shaped lot and has been landscaped beautiful=
ly, so we are quite pleased with  that.  And I LOVE the house.  It's really=
 very nice and I can hardly  wait for the whole move experience to be over =
and to be settled in there with  everything in it's place.  We overspent at=
 Sim's and that's going to be fun  receiving all that new furniture!
=20
Andrea, Michael and Braedon are doing  just fine.  They purchased a home in=
 Clearview Meadows and it's really very  nice!  Has a fenced yard with lots=
 of mature greenery and Braedon just  loves his new swing set and sand box.=
  Andrea & Michael are finding it  a real treat to be back in town and reli=
eves me that Andrea is so much closer to  the hospital.  She usually is wor=
king evening shifts and I always worried  about her travelling the highway =
so late at night, especially in the  winter.  They are expecting baby numbe=
r 2 and it would appear to be a girl  from the ultrasounds she's had so tha=
t is pretty exciting.  Miss Jordyn  Marie will be her name (they haven't de=
cided on a boy's name yet in the event  that Miss Jordyn Marie has a "Mr. W=
iggley" - but are pondering it).
=20
Mark, of course is a whole other  story.  That boy gives me a few new grey =
hairs on a regular basis.   He's no sooner apart from Nikki and "enter Alis=
on".  Alison is 18 years old  and very very quiet, so hard for us to get to=
 know her, but she seems quite nice  so that's a good thing.  (Not sitting =
around with a scowl on her face like  Nick usually did)  Mark and Alison ar=
e "in love" and are just ga-ga over  each other.  We are very nice to see h=
im so happy, although worry that it  all happened a bit soon.  But, what do=
 we know?  Mark has been having  trouble with his health and I'm somewhat c=
ertain it is stress related, however  he denies that.  He experiences such =
severe chest pains that he actually  passes out from the pain.  This has be=
en happening more frequently of late  and he had to leave the job he was on=
 in Fort St. John and return home to try to  get healthy before he moves to=
 Cold Lake on July 1st!  (That's the other  big change)  They've run EKG's =
(or ECG's) on him, taken blood, chest  X-Rays, etc. and results all came ba=
ck clear, so they are unable to determine  what is causing him his problems=
.  I guess he's dropped alot of weight and  is now underweight for his age =
and height.  The Dr. has now determined it  is a muscle related problem and=
 has him on muscle relaxants and apparently they  are helping somewhat, so =
hopefully it will be as easy as that.
=20
I'm sad to see him leaving for Cold Lake  again as it is so far away and we=
 won't get to see him much - but you guys know  all about that!  He, on the=
 other hand is quite excited to get away and get  a "new" start so to speak=
, once again.  Alison is moving up there with them  and they are pretty exc=
ited to set up their own home.  Right now Alison is  in Australia - a trip =
she has been planning and saving for for quite some time,  but she is missi=
ng Mark terribly and trying to come home early.
=20
We are going to the production "Chicago"  with your mom and dad next weeken=
d and I'm really looking forward to the  day.  Dave and I are planning a tr=
ip to Toronto Dan - just a quick 4 dayer  with another couple and I think w=
e've pretty much decided on August 16 - 19th,  but tickets haven't been pur=
chased yet.  We will go see the Lion King and I  want to drive out to Niaga=
ra Falls while we're there also.  Should be  fun.  Hard for us to focus on =
too much until we get this move  completed.  We have until August 1st befor=
e we actually give up possession  here on the farm and thank God for all th=
e time - we seem to be needing it and  it's just flying!
=20
Well boys, I better get off the computer  and get back to my packing.  Will=
 do some packing and then head into town  to run some errands before we hav=
e to meet the painter.  Take care you two  and once again - Great job with =
the video!

I still see her now and then but she lives a rock star life and I don't have the stamina to go out 4 nights a week and get up at 4:30 for work. A little old for my taste as well. She is hot though. She looks exactly like Mariah Carey. It is great hanging out with her. It is amazing how much more interested other chicks are in a guy who hanging out with a bunch if hotties. Her best friend does the social "buzz" show in Houston's NBC station so she gets ticket and invites to every thing cool around town.

Mikey,

I am thinking of going with a townhouse / infill as opposed to an apartement style condo. I am going to look mostly in the Altadore / Killarney area. I think you get more house for your $ there as opposed to West Hillhurst. A couple of people have told me to check out Garrison Woods. Have you heard of it? What is the plan for the weekend. You should come down to Red Deer on Friday and have Earl's with the Dorlands. Maybe we could track down Johnny after. Are you taking a chica to the wedding? I am so looking forward to coming home. I got my face ripped off last week. Talk to you later...

Chris

Ian,
 
Thanx looks good. What I was really looking for was the relationship between Sumas and each of those points for the N-M and A-O strips.
 
Can you put these graphs together for me.

   Why One Firm Thinks Enron Is Running Out of Gas By Peter Eavis   Senior =
Columnist Originally posted at 5:23 PM ET 5/9/01 on RealMoney.com          =
  A small research boutique with a reputation for rigorous analysis is tell=
ing clients to quickly dump Enron (ENE :NYSE - news ), believing that the e=
nergy trading giant's 2001 earnings will fall well short of Wall Street's f=
orecasts.  Cambridge, Mass.-based Off Wall Street, led by analyst Mark Robe=
rts, thinks Enron's 2001 earnings will fall 6 cents short of the consensus =
estimate of $1.79. The firm also believes Enron stock should trade around $=
30, nearly 50% below Wednesday's $59.20.  The firm's 26-page report, publis=
hed May 6, highlights Enron's declining profitability and increasing levera=
ge and suggests that the company should trade on the same sort of multiple =
as a trading firm like Goldman Sachs (GS :NYSE - news ), which has a 2001 p=
rice-to-earnings ratio about half of Enron's 33 times. OWS also alleges tha=
t Enron's earnings quality is poor and that key parts of its financial stat=
ements are confusing and opaque.  Houston-based Enron didn't comment by pub=
lication time on elements of the report that Detox  sent the company. An en=
ergy analyst who is bullish on Enron's outlook says the OWS report contains=
 fundamental misunderstandings about the energy market and Enron's business=
 model, but he says the report does include some ground-breaking and valid =
insights. (The analyst's firm doesn't give stock recommendations.)  Economi=
es of Scale Why care what Off Wall Street writes, compared with, say, analy=
sts at Merrill Lynch (MER :NYSE - news )? For one, OWS has an excellent tra=
ck record. Particularly sweet was 2000, when the tech stocks it had bashed =
came crashing down. It has also shown itself to be well ahead of the curve,=
 recommending that clients sell e-tailer priceline.com (PCLN :Nasdaq - news=
 ) in June 1999, when faith in Internet stocks was at its blindest and thei=
r prices at their most insane.      Pulling Back Enron retreats after long =
rally   Enron, with its domination of a burgeoning energy market, annual re=
venue of over $100 billion and impressive earnings growth, can hardly be ra=
nked alongside the likes of priceline. But OWS thinks Enron is set for a pr=
ecipitous drop nonetheless. Why?  OWS's main beef is that key profitability=
 measures are in decline. Margins on Enron's pretax operating earnings (whi=
ch the company's earnings releases call IBIT, or income before interest, ta=
xes and other items) are falling. Total IBIT of $795 million in the first q=
uarter amounted to only 1.59% of the $50 billion in revenue for the period,=
 compared with a 2.08% margin in the fourth quarter and 4.75% in the year-e=
arlier period. Revenue in the first quarter was nearly quadrupled from the =
year-earlier period, yet IBIT rose only 27%. This shrinkage is due to lower=
-margin trading income making up an increasingly large share of Enron's rev=
enue base.  OWS thus calculates that for the remainder of 2001 Enron needs =
to generate an extra $2.1 billion in revenue for each additional penny it m=
akes over its 2000 EPS of $1.47 to reach analysts' expectation of $1.79.  T=
he energy analyst counters that OWS apparently hasn't grasped how Enron can=
 continue to increase earnings even when margins shrink. It does so simply =
by increasing volumes as the energy market balloons in size. In other words=
, margins may decline, but since revenues are so much higher, earnings stil=
l go up. Illustrating this, first-quarter 2001 EPS of 49 cents was 23% ahea=
d of the year-ago figure, even though the IBIT margin shrank by 3.2 percent=
age points. The analyst thinks Enron will make $1.82 per share in 2001.  Gr=
owing On You In addition, the huge growth in the energy market that has so =
helped Enron is likely to continue for several years, according to the anal=
yst. He notes that roughly 75% of the electricity available in the U.S. sti=
ll isn't traded in a market. "Eventually it will be part of a competitive e=
nvironment, but it'll take five to 10 years," says the analyst. And he beli=
eves the extreme volatility in energy-related commodities that has also ben=
efited Enron will exist for longer than OWS projects.  Still, OWS's point o=
n profitability is bolstered by other profit measures. Return on capital (n=
et income as a percentage of equity plus debt) was 6.6% in 2000, down on 19=
99's 6.9% and well below the 2000 returns on capital at Duke (DUK :NYSE - n=
ews ) (11.8%), Dynegy (DYN :NYSE - news ) (12.1%) and even Goldman (8.9%). =
 Even Enron bulls will admit that its financials are hard to follow. For ex=
ample, it doesn't give a gross margin number for its wholesale services, or=
 trading, business, which accounts for 96% of revenue. But one area of the =
company's financial statements registered with the Securities and Exchange =
Commission that consistently bugs analysts is the part that describes Enron=
's related party transactions, which are the deals it does with entities th=
at have some sort of link to the firm. In fact, one of the related entities=
 that Enron has traded with is headed by Enron's CFO, Andrew Fastow. The en=
ergy analyst comments: "Why are they doing this? It's just inappropriate." =
 The reason for maintaining these hard-to-follow related party deals has be=
en a source of speculation. But OWS analysis shows how a sales of optical f=
iber to a related party may have been used to goose earnings in the second =
quarter of 2000. Estimated profits from the so-called dark fiber (optical c=
able without the gear to send data over it) transaction allowed Enron to be=
at analysts' second-earnings earnings estimate by 2 cents a share, rather t=

I sold my car. $28000 USD but Enron is going to pay me $3000 USD for not having to move it and get it licensed in Canada. So it cost me $5000 to drive that car for a year. Not bad I guess. Have you and mom had any problems with her jeep?

Last week it would have been two cents, but now that there is a huge credit spread in the market, it may cost them .07.  We simply can't buy the physical volumes right now.  The credit spread in the SJ to cover our short is costing us .20.  

I love this market.

My intentions were not to lose you 30%. If you look at the trail of unrelated
events that unfolded over the last 2 years it is
easy to understand why the mkts have done so badly. This however does not help
people's frustration over the way the markets have performed over the last 2
yrs.

LOOKING BACK (1999-2001)



1. Y2K-	$ spent on technology
                   Gov~t allowed free flow of  money into system


2. DOT COM EXPLOSION-overvalued companies-3-4x- no value-no substance


3. SEPT. 2000- MIDDLE EAST NON-EVENT THREAT of WAR


4. MEDIA- OCT. 1987- comparing today to 1987-self fulfilling prophecy


5.  SOLID TECH COMPANIES 3Q earnings off due to Y2K slow downs


6.   U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION


7.   ENERGY CRISIS- led to low retail sales


8.  DEC. 2001 RETAIL SALES DECREASED- worst in 17 years


 9.MEDIA HYPE RE: RECESSION- businesses quit spending


10. SEPT. 11/02- panic, emotions run rapid, sell- drives mkt lower


11. ENRON SCANDAL


LOOKING AHEAD (2002)



DECREASED INTEREST RATES- 12 months to see effects- lowest in 40+ yrs
DECREASED INFLATION
DECREASED INVENTORIES & STAFF
ENCOURAGING GOVERNMENT FISCAL POLICY
IMPROVING CONSUMER CONFIDENCE
HISTORICAL RECORDS OF MARKET REBOUNDING

I just want to reposition  some funds you now own so going forward you will
better opportunity for gain.


I personally feel if we have another bad year like the last year you will see
massive layoffs and bankruptcies. In those going broke will be the banks.

Hi Chris,

I am attaching the breakdown on a Grand Cherokee that matches your request
as closely as possible.

The MSRP on the unit is $51,570 with pretty well every conceivable option -
I can get you this Grand Cherokee for the cash price of $45,188 including
rebates.

Take a look at the attachment and let me know if you have any questions or
comments.

Have a great day,

Dwayne

happened, because last I heard from your mom, you had signed on for 2 or 3
(poor memory on my part) years in Houston.  We should arrange some golf
while you're back if there's time.  I'll give you a call next week to touch

back next Tuesday.

Talk to you later,

Hi everyone!

Once again I find myself being tasked by Geof Storey. Houston has requested that we make lists of all applications that we use and also that we consolidate all of the files (models and data) that are critical to our business (I don't think MP3's count) into one directory on the network. This is so that these items can be included in the proposed deal with newco. The Calgary Trading group has set up a directory on I:/trading/newco and I think if each group did the same that would be great. Each group should probably have one person in charge of the directory so there isn't any overlap. Call me with any ?'s/

Thanx 

Chris

A couple of other quick things. My October Sumas position doesn't look correct. I am short 45000 mm/d and the report shows 50000 mm/d. I will list my oct sumas trades below if you can check on it for me. Also can you make sure my gas daily book is set up and include the change in position report in your daily e-mail.
 
Thanx,
 
Chris

Congress to Probe Enron Downfall

AP Online via COMTEX
November 30, 2001



Enron Corp. [ENE], already jarred by a spiraling stock price, a collapsed merger and massive debt, will be under the scrutiny of Congress.
Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, on Thursday announced hearings into Enron's accounting practices and into what impact the company's problems might have on electricity and natural gas markets.

"We're very interested in how the company handled its internal books," said Kenneth Johnson, a spokesman for the congressman, adding that the committee's general counsel had been directed to investigate circumstances leading up to the collapse.
Bankruptcy may be the smartest option for Enron Corp. as the once-mighty energy trader tries to extricate itself from a tangled mess of junk credit and massive debt, a bankruptcy expert and professor said.
"I would assume it would lead to a sale of the company, which was coming anyway," said Jay Westbrook, a bankruptcy expert who teaches at the University of Texas School of Law.
"Bankruptcy provides a lot of protections that makes it easier to do, and it buys time to find out what this company's really worth. That was Dynegy's problem - trying to figure out what the company was worth."
Analysts predicted bankruptcy was Enron's only option as the humbled company limped into limited operation Thursday to let skittish traders cut ties with it. The top executive for Dynegy Inc. [DYN], Enron's smaller rival and would-be savior, also detailed how Enron's financial "decay" caused a rescue merger to crumble.
Stunned employees tried to find hope in the fact that Enron - just months ago a towering presence in the energy markets - had yet to make a bankruptcy filing.
EnronOnline, the company's Internet-based trading system, was up and running on a limited basis for traders to finish transactions and offset credit risk with the company. The site, which was the first of its kind, was shut down for several hours Wednesday after Dynegy Inc. called off the merger.
But analysts said that operation, which was Enron's chief money maker, needs cash and credit to survive - both of which are scarce for the trader.
``Everyone should have at least some skepticism that it could ever emerge from Chapter 11,'' A.G. Edwards & Sons analyst Mike Heim said Thursday. ``The energy trading business has probably taken such a hit to its reputation that it would be difficult to retrench and go forward.''
Enron officials did not return repeated calls for comment.
A haggard Chuck Watson, chairman and chief executive of Dynegy Inc., said a steady stream of revelations of weak finances and decline in Enron's core energy trading business left his company no choice but to walk away.
"This was a very difficult, complex, unprecedented decay of a company over many months," he said at a news conference. "That's a shame, because (a merger) could have worked."
Dynegy announced the rescue plan Nov. 9, knowing that Enron posted a $618 million loss in third-quarter earnings and had ousted its chief financial officer for running partnerships that allowed the company to keep half a billion dollars in debt off its books. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating.
But that wasn't all.
Nov. 19 Enron filed paperwork with the SEC that restated its earnings back to 1997, eliminating more than $580 million in reported income in that time span. The filing also disclosed that Enron would have to pay a $690 million debt within a week.
Enron got an extension for the debt, but its stock resumed a free-fall that had halted temporarily with the merger announcement. Dynegy started renegotiating Enron's sale price.
After falling 85% Wednesday, shares of Enron were off another 25 cents, or 41 percent, to finish at 36 cents in extremely heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Enron's 52-week high was reached last December, at $84.88.
Watson said surprises in the SEC filing caused irreparable damage, even as Dynegy continued to hammer away at an agreement.
When two agencies cut Enron's credit rating to junk status Wednesday - triggering an obligation to pay debts of $3.9 billion, or nearly twice the cash the company is believed to have - Watson said he had to stop trying to save another company and protect his own.
Watson said Dynegy invoked an escape clause in the merger agreement that allowed it to back out if Enron had serious financial problems, so Dynegy won't have to pay a $350 million breakup fee.
He also said Dynegy will acquire Enron's Northern Natural Gas pipeline - which has 16,500 miles of pipelines from Texas to the Great Lakes - in exchange for the $1.5 billion part-Dynegy owner ChevronTexaco pumped into the ailing trader. "Their pipeline operation is as good as any in the industry," Watson said. "The real question is the wholesale operation, and the viability of that and how fast they can come back into the market."
Enron may challenge that acquisition, but Watson said the tradeoff ensured ChevronTexaco wouldn't be out $1.5 billion.
"That pipeline will be Dynegy's Dec. 19," he said.
Rob Doty, Dynegy's chief financial officer, said Friday that because Dynegy is the pipeline's preferred stockholder, Northern Natural Gas cannot seek bankruptcy protection without Dynegy's approval.
He said the pipeline has been a separate subsidiary of Enron for more than 20 years. Dynegy will assume $950 million of Northern Natural Gas debt, Doty said.

My month to date P&L is incorrectly showing (300K) on the P&L report because they haven't transferred all of the deals out of the BC book into Lambie's book. I am told that this won't be done untill next week? because Brian Gillis is out of the office. Just so you know I back of the envelope calc. my P&L at about 225K MTD.

Listen to this shit. If I want to move my car back to Canada I (Enron) would have to pay $2000 USD to move it plus 6.1% of KBB value in import duty plus 7% GST plus $200 excise tax plus about $400 in permits. Looks like I am looking for a new car as well.

When I was 26 I was looking for an 18 year old girlfriend who looks exactly like Britney Spears. Keep your eyes open. 2 Weeks till I am back in Calgary. I can't wait. Sold my car yesterday to a buddy of mine down here. I'm going to buy an Grand Cherokee Limited like my mom's. Black I think. What's new? I can't wait to get this move over and get settled in Calgary. I am really excited to move into my new place. It is going to be sweet. I think I can accomodate your request for a synthetic pillow. Are we going to be able to get some golf in before the snow comes? Talk to you soon.

Chris

Traci,

I am really looking forward to my cooking class. My first one is this Saturday morning. I'm a little scared I am going to be the class screw up. Oh well, I won't know untill I try. I think I am going to Yoga on Wednesday but dinner on Friday would be great. Give me a shout or drop me an e-mail and let me know what time you want to eat and I'll make some reservations. Talk to you soon.

Good Morning!

I am having a crazy week!  At least it is keeping me out of trouble!
I really enjoyed seeing you again as well.  It is good to see that you are
doing so well!

I have two appointments this week in Calgary.  Wednesday I have two and
Friday afternoon another.  If you want to get together either Wednesday for
Coffee (after 7 sometime) or Friday for a later dinner (after 6 sometime)
let me know.

Good luck with your cooking classes! Hopefully all appendages remain
attached.

Talk with you soon!

What is the specific appeal of distressed debt? If you are going to trade debt or equities GS is the place to be.

Nicely done with the email.

What do you think of my next career move (still a few years away) --
distressed debt trader at Goldman Sachs.

I found a guy who will hire me and I think I want to do it (mostly 'cause
no chicks do), but will have to wait until I am willing to stop partying
until all hours during the week (i.e. a few years away).  You really do
have to come visit while I am here.  I can't see moving any time soon, but
that being said I am thinking about putting some time in in London and/or
Paris at some point, so we'll have to see.  Why don't you do your
Amsterdam/Paris/London trip in late Nov when I am thinking of doing
mine....those are the three cities I was thinking of hitting on mine
anyway.  We oculd meet up.  DIdn't know you were going to that wedding this
w/e.  Say HI to my parents for me.  And TOm and Vicky Liles.  And my little
bro.  Johnny Zuk is engaged too, hey?  Does Dan have a g.f.?  31 isn't too
old...Are you going to go visit her?  I should go save this company from
the depths o fbankrupt despair now.  LAter.

Jill,

Sorry about the brief first reply things have been a little busy. What is
with people (that article) ? Working long hours just for the sake of
working long hours. I am pushing for a 4 day work week.
Why Calgary? Why not? I love Calgary. Actually the guy that ran our trading
operation in Calgary is getting married to an American who works in Houston
so he is moving to accommodate her career. This has left a hole in our
Canadian operation and my boss felt that I was just the cork to fill that
hole. I think it is a promotion. Besides, Houston in the arm pit of the
world. This city has few redeeming features. What it lacks in culture and
sophistication it makes up for by its lack of clean air and any form of
natural beauty. Actually, it isn't that bad. Houston has good restaurants,
decent night life and the people are really friendly but given the choice I
would much rather live in Calgary. In this business odds are that I will
find myself back here sooner than later so might as well enjoy Canada while
I can.

Kerrie got engaged. Good for her. I have a cactus in my bathroom that is
dying from lack of attention. I am not engaged. I was seeing someone for a
while but she took a work assignment in Venezuela. No big loss. Too old for
me anyway (31).

Glad to hear that you are enjoying you time in NY. I am going to have to
visit some time. I know I say that every time we chat but I really would
like to try to get down there before you move on to your next destination.
Or is NY home for a while?

No Vacation plans other than that I am going to Matt and Jen's wedding this
weekend. Should be a good party and I hung out with those guys quite a bit
when I was living in Calgary. Also I am going to look for a place to live
in Calgary in Friday. My friend Mohammed from TO is moving to Rotterdam to
do his MBA so I might try to visit him in the spring. Do a little
Amsterdam, Paris, London whirlwind tour.

My family is doing great. My dad sold Titan to a Comglomerate from the US
and is retiring in January and my mom is up to the same stuff. Dancing and
buying shit for their house. Both of their health is great. My dad has been
playing lots of golf and feeling great.

How is Meg doing? Is she in Australia now? I should get in touch with her.
I saw Reagan Neiss in commercial for her TV show last night. Good for her.
I hope all goes well for her. Dan did go to D's wedding. Said it was really
nice. Still don't get that one?

I have to stop writing now my fingers hurt. Keep in touch.

Chris

(this e-mail is record length for me)

   That's it?  That's all I get after all this time?
   How are you?
   Good to hear you are excited to go back to Calgary, if that is where you
   are headed next.
   I am in Virginia at the moment working at client's office (a troubled
   telecom company; like they're not a dime a dozen).  Nice to stay in a
   hotel
   and live for free for a change.  For the past few weeks I have been
   living
   the life of a consultant, flying to VA for Tues through Thurs and in the
   office Mon and Fri.  I don't mind.  It's good for the pocketbook and for
   the frequent flyer points.  Plus it works out that I get all my weekends
   off that way.

   Why back to Calgary?

   Have you heard the big news?  It is only a few days old so I am sure you
   haven't, but Kerrie got engaged.

   Are you engaged?  Just asking because everyone but me is, it would
   appear.
   Any new news in that department for you?  I have started seeing someone
   new, but it is really casual and really new.  He is another lawyer and
   from
   St. Albert, Alberta of all places!  Met him at a cocktail part for
   Canadian
   lawyers working in New York.  Speaking of which, I am coming up on my
   one
   year anniversary of living here (and of having a real job) and am loving
   both living here and work.  No complaints.  Am off to my best friend
   from
   law school's wedding in Vancouver in Sept so I am taking a week off
   then,
   other than that no big vacay planned for the summer.  And you?  I do
   plan
   on going to visit a close friend who is moving to Paris in the fall so
   I'll
   likely go for American Thanksgiving, but that's about it.

   Meghan was here visiting when she was back in June.  Liles came to town
   the
   same w/e.  Shauna Snow (who is also engaged) and Jackie Boase came here
   for
   a visit as well in early May.  We had a blast, of course.  Liles came as
   well that w/e.  The parents made their first trip to the big city in
   March
   and had a fabulous time and have already planned their top ten things to
   do
   during their next visit.  It has been a good year for having people come
   visit (even though my dorm room at UofA was bigger than my apt, we all
   survived).

   How is your fam?  Dev said he was at Matt's stag party and Danny came
   home
   and surprised him.  That's cool.  I guess that wedding is this w/e.  Did
   he
   go to Dion and Suzanne's wedding?  My mom got a kick out of calling me
   to
   say she was going to my first ex-boyfriend's wedding that day.  What are
   Kent and Judy up to this summer?  How's their health?  (wasn't sure how
   to
   pluralize that).  How is Dan liking TO?

   There.  Now you have no choice but to write back a longer, more
   informative
   email.

   Later

   Hope you're well and not working too hard -- even early retirement isn't
   worth it!

   For me it isn't about fulfillment or finding my life's purpose in my
   work.
   It's all about the $$$. Work hard and retire early.

   Cheers

   Chris

   P.S. I am moving back to Calgary in about a month. Enron continues to
   feel
   free to move me around at will. I am actually really looking forward to
   it.

Vicki

I called the number you gave me and they said that my refund check had been mailed in May. I never received the check and am wondering what to do next? The IRS said they would put a trace on the check and get back to me but that was over a week ago. I was wondering if PWC could look into it for me as you might get further than I have. Please contact me if you need any further info. or with any questions. 

Thank you,

Strong decade foreseen for real estate 
'Demand for all types of housing is set to surge': Aging Baby Boomers, their children and immigrants to drive residential prices
Paul Vieira 
Financial Post 
The tail end of the Baby Boom generation, along with children of aging boomers and new immigrants to Canada, will keep the residential real estate market strong over the next 10 years, driving the average value of a house up 13%, a new study suggests.
"Demand for all types of housing is set to surge ahead over the coming decade, leading to robust activity, rising prices and a stable investment climate," says the study, jointly written by ReMax Ontario-Atlantic Canada, ReMax Western Canada and Clayton Research.
And Calgary will have the hottest real estate market, with housing prices set to climb 20% to 25% in the next decade, the study says.
Overall, the number of households will increase by 1.5 million over the next 10 years, leading to rising prices for existing homes and steady demand for newly built homes.
Peter Norman, vice-president of Clayton Research, a Toronto-based real estate consulting firm, said the increase will be fuelled by three factors: younger Baby Boomers, between the ages of 35 to 45, who are looking to buy their first home or upgrade from their current residence; the children of the older Boomers, generally 45 to 55, who will be entering the real estate market for the first time; and immigrants.
"Housing prices will remain quite firm over the next 10 years and move up in real terms" Mr. Norman said in an interview.
The combination of high rents and low rental vacancies, particularly in cities such as Toronto and Vancouver, will also help drive the housing market, as will the fact that there has been little or no construction of new rental units.
And mortgage rates are so low that buying is often as financially palatable as renting, Mr. Norman added.
The study concluded that the economy, although in a slump, is in much better shape than it was at the eve of the 1990s recession. Productivity and real income growth have recovered, unemployment is at lower levels than a decade ago, and the country's industrial structure has shifted away from a commodity and manufacturing base, the study said.
"A healthy, long-term economy will boost housing markets by keeping real incomes growing, real interest rates low, and providing confidence in the future performance of real estate assets."
Pamela Alexander, chief executive of ReMax Ontario-Atlantic Canada, said Calgary would be the hottest market in the country thanks to increasing oilpatch activity, migration from other parts of the country and its youthful population.
"Calgary is going through its renaissance period," Ms. Alexander said, adding that its average home price of $180,000 is still 30% to 35% cheaper than Vancouver or Toronto.
Toronto, with its average house price of $250,000, should see growth of 10% to 15%, Ms. Alexander said, because its population is heavily weighted toward 25 to 40 year olds -- who will buy their first home or upgrade -- and because of the scarcity of rental units.
Meanwhile, Ottawa, despite the high-tech downturn, remained one of the hottest housing markets with prices up 10% from a year ago. That market is expected to grow as the federal government increases spending and creates new departments, older civil servants retire and new people are brought in, and the high-tech sector rebounds.

John,

Cancelled my trip to Vancouver this weekend. Car I was going to look at sold already. How are things going? Married? I am soo glad to be back in Calgary. I didn't think much of Houston. Life has been pretty boring. Looks like things are going to get busy again. Going to be working for UBS Wharburg Energy. A new sub of UBS AG. Should be good. Seems like at great company. AA+ credit will be nice. They have a good risk tolerance and are more or less going to give us limits and let us do our own thing. Hopefully a little more stable than Enron. I think the largest financial instituion in the world should be. Anyway give me a call if you get to Calgary and we will grab some food.

Take care

Chris

As you have heard, Dynegy is terminating the merger agreement today.  Among other things, this means we are now free to pursue other alternatives - which we are actively doing.  As a consequence of uncertainty about the deal - and now Dynegy's announcement - Enron's debt was downgraded to below investment grade levels today by S&P, Moody's and Fitch.  

In response to this action, we have initiated a plan to protect value in our core trading and other energy businesses.  At the same time, we are nearing the completion of the business review process announced last week.  Once this process is complete, we will be conducting a comprehensive restructuring of our business.  Regrettably, but unavoidably, this will include the sale of non-core assets and the implementation of a comprehensive cost saving plan, including layoffs. 

We are taking these actions to focus our resources on preserving the value of our core businesses, retaining our employees who are key to our future success, and maintaining relationships with our trading counterparties.  This must be our priority to establish a more solid footing for the rest of Enron.

I know you have serious concerns about what this all means for you.  Although, there are no guarantees, you should know that we are still in this fight and remain absolutely committed to protecting the value of the ongoing businesses of Enron.  All I can ask is that we all be supportive of each other, stay focused on our work as best we can, and stick together while we work to overcome these latest challenges.

Even six or so weeks ago, none of us could have imagined that we would be where we are today.  We will not recover in six weeks what we have lost, but we will work to stabilize and then rebuild this great company.  As always, I appreciate the extraordinary contributions each of you make.  Thank you.

Ken

Enron Canada 'critical' to auction in U.S. 
Unit remains solvent: Part of package to sell trading business, Milnthorp says
Claudia Cattaneo, Calgary Bureau Chief 
Financial Post; with files from Bloomberg News 
CALGARY - Enron Canada Corp. cut half its staff and halted its trading operations while waiting for an auction in the United States that could yield a buyer today for Enron's trading business, the president and chief executive of the Canadian unit said yesterday.
Robson Milnthorp said the Canadian arm will be "critical" to a deal to sell Enron Corp.'s trading business because it has been the most profitable in the company.
The unit remains solvent, with more than $220-million in cash and more than $100-million owed by counterparties -- partners with whom it has contracts -- that are refusing to honour their obligations, he said in an interview.
If there's no bid for the Canadian operation, Enron Canada will look for a white knight of its own, he said.
"We have been very careful not to jeopardize the efforts made on Houston's part with respect to the [auction]. But if that was to fall through, Canada would attempt to find its own white knight, so to speak. We had numerous expressions of interest and none of those have been pursued at this time."
Houston-based Enron Corp. was negotiating yesterday with at least six potential buyers for its wholesale trading business in an auction that was part of efforts to reorganize itself under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The auction was expected to continue into the evening.
In Manhattan, U.S. bankruptcy judge Arthur J. Gonzalez scheduled a hearing for today to approve the sale.
Enron Canada was Canada's largest market maker of natural gas and power until it was swept up in the failure of its indirect parent, which unraveled after disclosures that Enron Corp. had shifted billions of dollars in debt off its books. It was left saddled with at least US$40-billion in debt.
Enron Corp.'s troubles deepened this week with revelations that the U.S. Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation. There was also an admission yesterday by the firm that audited Enron's books, Arthur Andersen LLP, that a "significant but undetermined" number of documents related to the company had been destroyed.
Mr. Milnthorp said the investigation "has nothing to do with Enron Canada."
The Canadian unit attempted last month to distance itself from the parent and re-emerge as an independent company but gave up after losing a bid in an Alberta court to keep counterparties from unwinding contracts, its major asset.
Mr. Milnthorp said the Canadian arm was packaged as part of a deal to sell Enron's overall trading business, which buys and sells oil, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity, metals, coal, forest products and steel, and a variety of contracts and derivatives. The company would get cash and a 49% stake in a new partnership called "Netco," short for New Energy Trading Company, under the proposed sale. The trading unit generated about 90% of Enron Corp.'s US$100.8- billion in revenue in 2000.
Mr. Milnthorp said 75 employees in Calgary and Toronto were laid off after last month's court proceedings and trading was suspended because of lack of confidence in the market.
"To be successful in this business, you need a very solid balance sheet that creates the confidence necessary to enter into long-term transactions. That's been one of the key criteria through the auction process," he said.
Enron Canada's remaining employees are "trying to manage the estate and trying to work hard to co-operate with our customers to get them paid," he said.
The unit is cash rich from the sale last month of its interest in the Sundance B power-generating plant outside of Edmonton.
Bidders for all or parts of the trading operation include Citigroup Inc., the largest financial services company, UBS AG, the largest Swiss bank, and BP PLC, one of the largest oil and gas companies.

Subject:	Follow up on our conversation

Rob,

I would just like to follow up on our conversation and clarify any confusion you may have about where I stand. I have loved working for Enron over the past two years and have gained invaluable experience. I look forward to harnessing the opportunities in Ontario under the UBS banner and working with the former Enron team. Recently there have been a considerable number of companies soliciting Enron people familiar with the electricity market in Ontario. I evaluated the opportunities on the table and had come to a decision about my future, I want to stay with the team at Netco.

I communicated to Paul that I did not feel that the retail opportunity was rewarding enough to leave. He said that he would follow up with you to get back to me with more specifics on my role within Netco and to see if I have the opportunity to get into trading. It came as quite a shock to me when you mentioned my place within Netco had been compromised. I never gave Paul any commitment to join him on a retail venture or empowered him to speak on my behalf!

Rob, I apologize for this confusion and truly appreciate your understanding. I realize that the experience I stand to gain, the caliber of people I will work with, the credibility or the organization I will work for and my future earning potential will be significantly higher if I stay with the team and join UBS. I am confident that I know this market as well as anyone in this office, and I will continue to work hard to add value to the new organization.

Again, thanks for your support and please accept my apologies for the any miscommunication.

Sincerely,

Dan Dorland

Stock market is exploding. Dow 11133 (up 260). Nasdaq 2150 (up 60). It has to be higher than where you bought now?

Hi Chris,

I don't honestly know how long they will be available as our first 2002
arrived on Monday, so that would suggest that we aren't receiving any more
2001 models.  There are still several available, but if we didn't have your
2001 in stock, I would locate it at another dealer and bring it in for the
same price.

The next step might also be to give me your top choices for colours so I can
keep an eye out for you.

By the way, my work number is 730-4000, or toll-free 1-866-881-1888.

Take care,
Dwayne

Maria,

That is pretty close but we don't even have real guns... just snowballs....

How are things going down there? I am pretty much settled now but still waiting for a bunch of furniture so my house is pretty empty. Hope all is well.

   am going to do with my ride. I think I am going to bring it with me and
   buy
   a set of winter wheels and some killer winter tires. Don't you have a
   tire
   guy?

>>like perfectly nice gentlemen. But racial stereotypes  
>>are powerful and fear immobilized her.  
>>  
>>She stood and stared at the two men. She felt anxious,  
>>flustered and ashamed. She hoped they didn't read her  
>>mind but Gosh; they had to know what she was thinking!!!  
>>Her hesitation about joining them in the elevator was  
>>all too obvious now. Her face was flushed. She couldn't  
>>just stand there, so with a mighty effort of will she  
>>picked up one foot and stepped forward and followed with  
>>the other foot and was on the elevator. Avoiding eye  
>>contact, she turned around stiffly and faced the  
>>elevator doors as they closed. A second passed, and then  
>>another second, and then another. Her fear increased!  
>>The elevator didn't move. Panic consumed her. My God,  
>>she thought, I'm trapped and about to be robbed!  
>>  
>>Her heart plummeted. Perspiration poured from every  
>>pore. Then one of the men said, "Hit the floor."  
>>Instinct told her to do what they told her. The bucket  
>>of quarters flew upwards as she threw out her arms and  
>>dove to the elevator floor. A shower of coins  
>>rained down on her. Take my money and spare me, she prayed.  
>>  
>>More seconds passed. She heard one of the men say  
>>politely, "Ma'am, if you'll just tell us what floor  
>>you're going to, we'll push the button." The one who  
>>said it had a little trouble getting the words out. He  
>>was trying mightily to hold in a belly laugh. The woman  
>>lifted her head and looked up at the two men. They  
>>reached down to help her up. Confused, she struggled to  
>>her feet. "When I told my friend here to hit the  
>>floor," said the average sized one, "I meant that he  
>>should hit the elevator button for our floor. I didn't  
>>mean for you to actually hit the floor, ma'am."  
>>  
>>He spoke genially. He bit his lip. It was obvious he was  
>>having a hard time not laughing. The woman thought: My  
>>God, what a spectacle I've made of myself. She was  
>>humiliated to speak. She wanted to blurt out an apology,  
>>but words failed her. How do you apologize to two  
>>perfectly respectable gentlemen for behaving as though  
>>they were going to rob you? She didn't know what to say.  
>>The three of them gathered up the strewn quarters and  
>>refilled her bucket.  
>>  
>>When the elevator arrived at her floor they then  
>>insisted on walking her to her room. She seemed a little  
>>unsteady on her feet, and they were afraid she might not  
>>make it down the corridor.  
>>  
>>At her door they bid her a good evening. As she slipped  
>>into her room she could hear them roaring with laughter  
>>as they walked back to the elevator. The woman brushed  
>>herself off. She pulled herself together and went  
>>downstairs for dinner with her husband.  
>>  
>>The next morning flowers were delivered to her room  
>>- a dozen roses.  
>>  
>>Attached to EACH rose was a crisp one hundred dollar

I'll probably have a little room but below 28K I'll probably just move it back to Calgary. Let me know if you want to see it. I car pool with Benson so I only have it here every other day.

Subject:	Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the 1600 Smith garage are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Sky Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Please respond via e-mail if you are interested in acquiring one of these spaces.

Done. I'm moving in! Can I borrow your lawn mower? I need to decide what I am going to do with my ride. I think I am going to bring it with me and buy a set of winter wheels and some killer winter tires. Don't you have a tire guy?

Subject:	Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the 1600 Smith garage are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Sky Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Please respond via e-mail if you are interested in acquiring one of these spaces.

Good Afternoon Everyone:

We have recently come upon an indoor parking opportunity in the Ernst & Young Tower as approximately 30 indoor stalls have become available.

Right now you are either parking in the Westin Hotel lot (paying $342.40/month) or in the Eau Claire Market lot (paying $300.00/month).  If you choose to take a stall in the Ernst & Young Tower, you will pay $353.10/month for an  unreserved stall or $401.25/month for a reserved stall.

Before making a decision as to whether you would like to switch over to one of these indoor stalls, please take a moment to consider the pros and cons:

Pro:							Con:

Indoor Parking						Outdoor Parking
							Price per month is Higher
							Month-to-Month Basis (Either Side Can Cancel with One-Month's Notice)*	
							Your Taxable Benfit Goes Up 	

Please let me know prior to Wednesday, September 19, 2001 whether you would like one of these stalls.

Thank you,

Megan

*Ernst & Young may cancel at any time at their discretion.

Sherry, 

This stuff looks perfect. I think I like the 385-B the best. I don't think I want the hutch though. So I guess I need 3 pieces (385-512,519,533). Can please order the pieces you don't have in stock. Also, this Thursday is just fine to deliver that stuff. Can you please remind the guys in the warehouse to pick up that loveseat at Carleton House. Be sure to let me know what it cost to fix that so I can bill the moving company. 

Thanx for all the help!

Chris

Once upon a time in the Kingdom of Heaven, God went missing for six
days.
Eventually, Michael the archangel found him, resting on the seventh
day.
He inquired of God, "Where have you been?"
God sighed a deep sigh of satisfaction and proudly pointed downwards
through the clouds, "Look Michael, look what I've made."
Archangel Michael looked puzzled and said, "What is it?"

"It's a planet," replied God, "and I've put LIFE on it. I'm going to
call it Earth and it's going to be a great place of balance."
"Balance?" inquired Michael, still confused.


God explained, pointing to different parts of Earth, "For example,
Northern Europe will be a place of great opportunity and wealth while
Southern
Europe is going to be poor; the Middle East over there will be a hot
spot.
Over there I've placed a continent of white people and over there is a
continent of black people,"
God continued, pointing to different countries. "This one will be
extremely
hot and arid while this one will be very cold and covered in ice."
The Archangel, impressed by Gods work, then pointed to a large landmass

in the top corner and asked, "What's that one?"
"Ah," said God. "That's Canada, the most glorious place on Earth.
There are beautiful mountains, lakes, rivers, streams and an exquisite
coastline.
The people from Canada are going to be modest, intelligent and humorous
and
they're going to be found traveling the world. They'll be extremely
sociable, hard working and high achieving, and they will be known
throughout the world as diplomats and carriers of peace. I'm also going
to give
them super-human, undefeatable ice hockey players who will be admired
and
feared by all who come across them."


Michael gasped in wonder and admiration but then proclaimed; "What
about balance, God? You said there will be BALANCE!"
God replied wisely. "Wait until you see the loud-mouthed obnoxious
idiots I'm putting next to them...."

1999 SURVIVAL GUIDE FOR TAKING A DUMP AT WORK. 
ESCAPEE 
Definition: 
  A fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal   or 
forcing poop in a stall. This is usually  accompanied by a sudden wave 
of panic/embarrassment.  This is similar to the hot flash you receive 
when  passing an unseen police car and speeding. If you release an 
escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen. If you  are 
standing next to the farter at the urinal, pretend  that you did not 
hearit. No one likes an escapee, it  is uncomfortable for all involved. 
Making a joke or  laughing makes both parties feel uneasy. 
JAILBREAK (Used in conjunction with escapee) 
Definition: When forcing poop, several farts slip out at a machine  guns 
pace. This is usually a side effect of diarrhea  or a hangover. If this 
should happen do not panic,  remain in the stall until everyone has left 
the  bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred.  
COURTESY FLUSH 
Definition: The act of  flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of 
the  poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an 
undisclosed location. This reduces the amount of air time the poop  has 
to stink up the bathroom. This can help you avoid  being caught doing the 
WALK OF SHAME. 
WALK OF SHAME 
Definition: Walking from  the stall, to the sink, to the door after you 
have  just stunk-up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment  
if someone walks in and busts you. As with all farts, it is  best to 
pretend that the smell does not exist. Can be  avoided with the use of a 
COURTESY FLUSH. 
OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER 
Definition: A  colleague who poops at work and is damn proud of it. You 
will often see an Out of the Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with   
newspaper or magazine under their arm. Always look  around the office for 
the Out of the Closet pooper  before entering the bathroom. 
THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (PFN) 
Definition: A group of coworkers who band together to ensure  emergency 
pooping goes off without incident. This  group can help you to monitor 
the whereabouts of OUT  OF THE CLOSET POOPERS and identify SAFE HAVENS. 
SAFE HAVEN 
Definition: A seldom used  bathroom somewhere in the building where you 
can least  expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the 
opposite sex. This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex  entering 
the bathroom. 
TURD BURGLAR 
Definition: A pooper who  does not realize that you are in the stall and 
tries  to force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and 
vulnerable moments that occur when taking a dump at work. If  this 
occurs, remain in the stall until the TURD  BURGLAR leaves. This way you 
will avoid all  uncomfortable eye contact. 
CAMO-COUGH 
Definition: A phony cough  which alerts all new entrants into the 
bathroom that  you are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a 
WATERMELON or to alert potential TURD BURGLARS. Very effective when  used 
 in 
conjunction with  an ASTAIRE. 
ASTAIRE 
Definition: A subtle toe-tap  that is used to alert potential TURD 
BURGLARS that you  are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that 
the stall is occupied. If you hear an ASTAIRE, leave the  bathroom 
immediately so the pooper can poop in  peace. 
WATERMELON 
Definition: A turd that  creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet 
water.  This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a WATERMELON  
coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH. 
HAVANA OMELET 
Definition: A load of  diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes 
in the  toilet water. Often accompanied by an escapee. Try using a 
CAMO-COUGH with an ASTAIRE. 
UNCLE TED 
Definition: A bathroom user  who seems to linger around forever. Could 
spend  extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the  
pot. An UNCLE TED makes it difficult to relax while on the  crapper, as 
 you 
should  always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty.This 
benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees. 
FLY BY 
Definition: The act of scouting  out a bathroom before pooping. Walk in, 
check for  other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and 
come back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER.   People may 
become suspicious if they catch you  constantly going into the bathroom. 
CRACK WHORE 
Definition: A crapper that  has seen more ass than a Greyhound Bus. 
Tell tale  signs of a CRACK WHORE include hairs, stains and streaks. 
Avoid CRACK WHORES at all cost. Try finding out when the janitor  cleans 
each particular bathroom. Don't forget with a  good cleaning,a CRACK 
 WHORE 
can become a SAFE HAVEN.

What's going on? Hope all you exams went well. Are you coming home for the
holidays? If so give me a shout in the office, at home or in Red Deer.
Things are a little nuts around here but everything with me is fine and I
have a few alternatives to consider. All the best to you and your family.

   What's up? Good to hear from you. I am very happily back in Calgary.
   Things
   at Enron are totally fucked up right now. Not really sure how it is
   going

      Are you back in Calgary or still in Houston?

      Let me know, are you coming to visit.  Do I have stories for you!!!

Canadian's Testicles Torn Off, Girlfriend Charged 
TORONTO (Reuters) - A man is recovering from an unwanted birthday surprise after a fight with his girlfriend in which she is alleged to have yanked his testicles so hard she tore them from his scrotum, the Globe and Mail reported on Tuesday. 
The 46-year-old man had just returned from birthday celebrations early Monday morning in Pickering, east of Toronto, when, according to police, he and his girlfriend got into a fight. 
"Last we heard, last night he was at Pickering Ajax Hospital waiting for surgery to have them put back on," police told the Globe. "That was quite the birthday present he got." 
The woman was arrested and charged with aggravated assault, the paper reported. Police are not releasing her name, to protect the identity of her partner. 
"It must have been one hell of a pull," Philip Kotz, a Toronto urologist, told the paper. "I've heard of the slicing off of a penis but the pulling out or off of the testicles by a spouse or a human is pretty uncommon. I've never seen one and I've been in practice for 50 years." 
There was no word on the man's condition or chances for full recovery, but doctors said it all depends on the amount of damage to the area. 
"If the testicles are pulled right off then it's goodbye Charlie, they're gone. He's not going to have any testicles," Dr. Kotz told the Globe." If, on the other hand, the scrotum was pulled off -- that's the bag that holds the testicles -- and the testicles are intact then it's not a big deal to sew the scrotum back on, depending on how badly it was wrenched off." 
Similar to this incident was the case of John Wayne Bobbit, whose wife sliced off his penis and threw it into a field in 1993. Bobbit's penis was surgically reattached and he went on to star in an adult film.

***********************************************************************

INDIA-PAKISTAN WAR? RISKS AND IMPLICATIONS

Prospects are growing that a short, sharp war could occur between India and
Pakistan over the next several weeks. It is not inevitable; diplomacy could
still pull the two parties back.

*  Such a war--if it does occur--need not prompt doomsday predictions or
excessive global concern so long as both countries see short-term political
advantages accruing from a tightly contained conflict.

*  It would have a complicating but manageable impact on the American-led
counterterrorism effort in south and central Asia.

*  A very limited-duration conflict could even lead to intensive multilateral
efforts to solve the Kashmir dispute, the central dispute between India and
Pakistan.

Laura,

I don't know if you have heard but I am moving back to Calgary to trade gas. I am coming back in mid-september. Would you do a USD/CND currency swap for me when I get back? I would like to avoid the Royal Bank's huge bid / offer spread. Let me know. 

Thanx

Chris

Thanx for the info. I have 17" wheels on it now so I guess I will have to
get wheels and tires. Do you know what the 16" wheels look like? Is there
somewhere on the net I can see an example. Also I will need to have my car
winterized (install a blockheater ect...) when I move back so I will give
you a call then.

   Chris,

   Please disregard my last e-mail. I guess I completely misunderstood your
   message. I just need to know if your tires are 16 or 17 inch. If the are
   17
   inch you will need wheels and tires, but if they are only 16 inch then
   tires
   are all you need. Reason being, it is recommended that the IS300 is
   driven
   with 16 inch tires in the winter time. For pricing you are looking at
   $1686.00+gst
   (17 inch) and $746.00+gst (16 inch). The brand of tires that are
   recommended
   are Michelin Pilot Alpine Roh extreme wheel.
   If you need any other information please e-mail or phone @ (403)291-2111

   Al,

   I am moving to Calgary from Houston and am wondering if Lexus has a
   winter wheel/tire package for the 2001 IS 300. If not could you
   recommend a wheel / tire dealer in Calgary who could help me find
   something that would work. Thanx for your time.

Jill, 

Sorry about the brief first reply things have been a little busy. What is with people (that article) ? Working long hours just for the sake of working long hours. I am pushing for a 4 day work week. 
Why Calgary? Why not? I love Calgary. Actually the guy that ran our trading operation in Calgary is getting married to an American who works in Houston so he is moving to accommodate her career. This has left a hole in our Canadian operation and my boss felt that I was just the cork to fill that hole. I think it is a promotion. Besides, Houston in the arm pit of the world. This city has few redeeming features. What it lacks in culture and sophistication it makes up for by its lack of clean air and any form of natural beauty. Actually, it isn't that bad. Houston has good restaurants, decent night life and the people are really friendly but given the choice I would much rather live in Calgary. In this business odds are that I will find myself back here sooner than later so might as well enjoy Canada while I can. 

Kerrie got engaged. Good for her. I have a cactus in my bathroom that is dying from lack of attention. I am not engaged. I was seeing someone for a while but she took a work assignment in Venezuela. No big loss. Too old for me anyway (31). 

Glad to hear that you are enjoying you time in NY. I am going to have to visit some time. I know I say that every time we chat but I really would like to try to get down there before you move on to your next destination. Or is NY home for a while? 

No Vacation plans other than that I am going to Matt and Jen's wedding this weekend. Should be a good party and I hung out with those guys quite a bit when I was living in Calgary. Also I am going to look for a place to live in Calgary in Friday. My friend Mohammed from TO is moving to Rotterdam to do his MBA so I might try to visit him in the spring. Do a little Amsterdam, Paris, London whirlwind tour.

My family is doing great. My dad sold Titan to a Comglomerate from the US and is retiring in January and my mom is up to the same stuff. Dancing and buying shit for their house. Both of their health is great. My dad has been playing lots of golf and feeling great.

How is Meg doing? Is she in Australia now? I should get in touch with her. I saw Reagan Neiss in commercial for her TV show last night. Good for her. I hope all goes well for her. Dan did go to D's wedding. Said it was really nice. Still don't get that one? 

I have to stop writing now my fingers hurt. Keep in touch. 

Chris

(this e-mail is record length for me)

That's it?  That's all I get after all this time?
How are you?
Good to hear you are excited to go back to Calgary, if that is where you
are headed next.
I am in Virginia at the moment working at client's office (a troubled
telecom company; like they're not a dime a dozen).  Nice to stay in a hotel
and live for free for a change.  For the past few weeks I have been living
the life of a consultant, flying to VA for Tues through Thurs and in the
office Mon and Fri.  I don't mind.  It's good for the pocketbook and for
the frequent flyer points.  Plus it works out that I get all my weekends
off that way.

Why back to Calgary?

Have you heard the big news?  It is only a few days old so I am sure you
haven't, but Kerrie got engaged.

Are you engaged?  Just asking because everyone but me is, it would appear.
Any new news in that department for you?  I have started seeing someone
new, but it is really casual and really new.  He is another lawyer and from
St. Albert, Alberta of all places!  Met him at a cocktail part for Canadian
lawyers working in New York.  Speaking of which, I am coming up on my one
year anniversary of living here (and of having a real job) and am loving
both living here and work.  No complaints.  Am off to my best friend from
law school's wedding in Vancouver in Sept so I am taking a week off then,
other than that no big vacay planned for the summer.  And you?  I do plan
on going to visit a close friend who is moving to Paris in the fall so I'll
likely go for American Thanksgiving, but that's about it.

Meghan was here visiting when she was back in June.  Liles came to town the
same w/e.  Shauna Snow (who is also engaged) and Jackie Boase came here for
a visit as well in early May.  We had a blast, of course.  Liles came as
well that w/e.  The parents made their first trip to the big city in March
and had a fabulous time and have already planned their top ten things to do
during their next visit.  It has been a good year for having people come
visit (even though my dorm room at UofA was bigger than my apt, we all
survived).

How is your fam?  Dev said he was at Matt's stag party and Danny came home
and surprised him.  That's cool.  I guess that wedding is this w/e.  Did he
go to Dion and Suzanne's wedding?  My mom got a kick out of calling me to
say she was going to my first ex-boyfriend's wedding that day.  What are
Kent and Judy up to this summer?  How's their health?  (wasn't sure how to
pluralize that).  How is Dan liking TO?

There.  Now you have no choice but to write back a longer, more informative
email.

Later

Hope you're well and not working too hard -- even early retirement isn't
worth it!

P.S. I am moving back to Calgary in about a month. Enron continues to feel
free to move me around at will. I am actually really looking forward to it.

Enron lived 'on edge - sex, money, all of it' 
The rise and fall of Houston decadence
Philip Delves Broughton 
The Daily Telegraph, with files from news services 
HOUSTON - Enron was a company in love with itself. Office affairs were rampant, divorce among senior executives an epidemic and stories of couples steaming up glass-walled offices after late-night meetings were the talk of Houston.
"It was insane," says a former energy trader, soothing her financial injuries with a margarita.
"There were no rules for people, even in our personal lives. Everything was about the company and everything was supposed to be on the edge -- sex, money, all of it."
The music has suddenly stopped. The startling demise of the energy giant has wiped out savings and pensions, destroyed careers and dragged the U.S. version of free-market capitalism into the interrogation room.
The reverberations of Enron's collapse will be felt for years in Washington and on Wall Street, but nowhere more than in Houston, the stage for Enron's gaudy act. From the mid-1980s, when Enron was created by the merger of two energy companies, Houston became its town. The company filled the void left by the oil companies, whose buccaneering days had ended with the collapse in oil prices.
In River Oaks, the most exclusive suburb of Houston, Enron executives began building huge mansions. Jeff Skilling, the executive who transformed Enron under the more genteel rule of Ken Lay, the former chief executive, decorated his house in black and white, Enron's corporate colours, from the marble to the sofas to the flowers, wallpaper and pictures.
The Enron wives became known around town for their Mercedes, fur-trimmed sweaters and leather pants.
But in the excitement, Enron lost touch with its mortality, not to mention morality. Mr. Skilling wanted it to become an alternative to the Wall Street banks.
He wanted to recruit the best, which meant persuading the leading business school graduates from places such as Harvard, his alma mater, and Stanford to choose Houston over New York or Silicon Valley.
He did so by creating the same culture of unselfconscious greed and reward that Wall Street was forced to suppress by the insider-trading scandals of the late 1980s. He built his own Bonfire of the Vanities in Houston and everyone wanted to feel its warmth.
Among the perks were the in-house health club and doctor's office, as well as laundry and car-washing services. Broadband traders were issued hand-held computers and wireless laptops, and frequently went on junkets to the Bahamas or hunting weekends in Mexico. Others accompanied Mr. Skilling to hike glaciers in Patagonia or race Land Cruisers in Australia.
One employee described how he got a 10% discount in a tony men's clothing store by mentioning he worked for Enron. Elsewhere in town, nightclubs waived cover charges for Enron employees.
But the work culture that employed these carrots was brutal.
Managers employed a system known as "rank or yank," with semi-annual reviews in which every employee's performance was ranked one to five. As the names flashed on a projector, the bosses graded them. The bottom 15% of workers were fired each year.
The pay was not particularly high -- trainees started at US$35,000, The Wall Street Journal reported. But they could double that when bonuses were added. Bonus day was known as Car Day, because of the line of expensive sports cars that arrived for the most successful employees -- US$100,000 Porsches were the vehicle of choice.
To the outside world, Enron described itself as a family for which employees were delighted to work punishing hours. Inside it became increasingly incestuous, sexually and financially.
Only those at the top and the traders who saw the kinds of wild bets Enron was placing, on everything from oil to the weather, saw how precarious the whole thing was. They began pulling out as much money as they could.
The best brains began demanding vast salaries to stay and, to save face, Mr. Skilling paid them. Then they asked for more. Senior executives began selling their shares in huge blocks. Everyone at the top was cashing out, while those further down believed the hype.
"We all thrived on the buzz," said Mark Lindquist, 39, a Web designer who lost his US$75,000-a-year job and is struggling to pay for his autistic son's treatment. "It seemed like we were part of something incredible."
He was one of the 4,500 let go after the company fell into bankruptcy on Dec. 2.
Now, not only the rank-and-file are hurting. Yesterday, Mrs. Lay said her family also lost its fortune.
In an interview with NBC's Today show taped over the weekend at her home in Houston, Linda Lay defended her husband as a decent, moral person who, like many thousands of others linked to Enron, was fighting personal bankruptcy.
"Other than the home we live in, everything else is for sale," she said. "We are fighting for liquidity."

Crystal,

How was your trip? I was in Lake Conroe last weekend for a work retreat. We had a great time but I think Austin would have been a better destination. Susposed to be 95-100 next week but feel like 110 with the humidity. Can't wait. Take it easy.

 I am stuck living in the Hyatt in Houston.

I just wanted to thank all of you for getting in touch over the past day
and a half and expressing your concern for my well-being and the well-being
of my friends here in New York.  At a time of crisis of such a magnitude it
helped to feel loved even though I am far away from most of you.  I am sure
I will talk to most of you over the next couple of days if I have not done
so already.

Thanks again,

Love Jill

Matt,

Looking forward to the wedding. Unfortunately, I don't think I will be able to make it August long weekend but say high to Johnny and think of me. Take care and be sure to say hi to Jen.

Chris buddy!  How's it going?  I was chatting with Dan this morning and
I was able to track down your mailing address, so I can send you a
wedding invitation.  You're still M.C. right?  Just kidding, but it'll
be good to see you.  I hear everything's going good down there, speaking
for the rest of your buddies up north though, I'll be looking forward to
when that career path steers you back a little closer to home.  The
wedding is on August 18th(saturday), Mike & Nate are planning some golf,
camping and a little drinking as well on the August long weekend too if
you were planning on being back then as well, although that sounds like
a lot of travel.  Anyways, I suppose II'll see you at Sue and Dionne's
wedding?  Should be a good time.  Take it easy, Chris.

Matt Engelhardt

I don't know dude.  Leslie just told me she wanted your number as she is going to TO.  Hopefully it's soon.  I would really like to here a story about how the two of you went out for a glass of wine in TO.  Then she had 1 too many, spilt on her top, then asked to go back to your place to wash it out.  She then put one of your old T shirts on while it was in the wash.  You guys proceeded to have a couple more drinks.  When the shirt was finished drying - you were both pretty drunk.  She went to give you the old shirt back  - and didn't put the new one on.  You started to neck.  One thing led to another and you ended up smokin' a Benson and Hedges at 2:30 eastern time with a lovely red head lying on your 'coyote' arm - you are lying there thinkin', "I can't wait to call Marsy and George and tell them I nailed that hot chick from the wedding - and I was fantastic!"
 
 
Sorry dude, she is hot and my mind started racing,
 
Do us proud,

I think I'm going to buy a Grand Cherokee Limited instead of the X5 and save myself 30K. Are we on with Johnny next week?

1999 SURVIVAL GUIDE FOR TAKING A DUMP AT WORK. 
ESCAPEE 
Definition: 
  A fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal   or 
forcing poop in a stall. This is usually  accompanied by a sudden wave 
of panic/embarrassment.  This is similar to the hot flash you receive 
when  passing an unseen police car and speeding. If you release an 
escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen. If you  are 
standing next to the farter at the urinal, pretend  that you did not 
hearit. No one likes an escapee, it  is uncomfortable for all involved. 
Making a joke or  laughing makes both parties feel uneasy. 
JAILBREAK (Used in conjunction with escapee) 
Definition: When forcing poop, several farts slip out at a machine  guns 
pace. This is usually a side effect of diarrhea  or a hangover. If this 
should happen do not panic,  remain in the stall until everyone has left 
the  bathroom so to spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred.  
COURTESY FLUSH 
Definition: The act of  flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone of 
the  poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an 
undisclosed location. This reduces the amount of air time the poop  has 
to stink up the bathroom. This can help you avoid  being caught doing the 
WALK OF SHAME. 
WALK OF SHAME 
Definition: Walking from  the stall, to the sink, to the door after you 
have  just stunk-up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment  
if someone walks in and busts you. As with all farts, it is  best to 
pretend that the smell does not exist. Can be  avoided with the use of a 
COURTESY FLUSH. 
OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER 
Definition: A  colleague who poops at work and is damn proud of it. You 
will often see an Out of the Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with   
newspaper or magazine under their arm. Always look  around the office for 
the Out of the Closet pooper  before entering the bathroom. 
THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (PFN) 
Definition: A group of coworkers who band together to ensure  emergency 
pooping goes off without incident. This  group can help you to monitor 
the whereabouts of OUT  OF THE CLOSET POOPERS and identify SAFE HAVENS. 
SAFE HAVEN 
Definition: A seldom used  bathroom somewhere in the building where you 
can least  expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the 
opposite sex. This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex  entering 
the bathroom. 
TURD BURGLAR 
Definition: A pooper who  does not realize that you are in the stall and 
tries  to force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and 
vulnerable moments that occur when taking a dump at work. If  this 
occurs, remain in the stall until the TURD  BURGLAR leaves. This way you 
will avoid all  uncomfortable eye contact. 
CAMO-COUGH 
Definition: A phony cough  which alerts all new entrants into the 
bathroom that  you are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a 
WATERMELON or to alert potential TURD BURGLARS. Very effective when  used 
 in 
conjunction with  an ASTAIRE. 
ASTAIRE 
Definition: A subtle toe-tap  that is used to alert potential TURD 
BURGLARS that you  are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that 
the stall is occupied. If you hear an ASTAIRE, leave the  bathroom 
immediately so the pooper can poop in  peace. 
WATERMELON 
Definition: A turd that  creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet 
water.  This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a WATERMELON  
coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH. 
HAVANA OMELET 
Definition: A load of  diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes 
in the  toilet water. Often accompanied by an escapee. Try using a 
CAMO-COUGH with an ASTAIRE. 
UNCLE TED 
Definition: A bathroom user  who seems to linger around forever. Could 
spend  extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the  
pot. An UNCLE TED makes it difficult to relax while on the  crapper, as 
 you 
should  always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty.This 
benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees. 
FLY BY 
Definition: The act of scouting  out a bathroom before pooping. Walk in, 
check for  other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and 
come back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER.   People may 
become suspicious if they catch you  constantly going into the bathroom. 
CRACK WHORE 
Definition: A crapper that  has seen more ass than a Greyhound Bus. 
Tell tale  signs of a CRACK WHORE include hairs, stains and streaks. 
Avoid CRACK WHORES at all cost. Try finding out when the janitor  cleans 
each particular bathroom. Don't forget with a  good cleaning,a CRACK 
 WHORE 
can become a SAFE HAVEN.

Hi Chris,

Just a note to let you know that a tax equalization calculation will not be
prepared for you,,,, in case you were unsure.  This means that the refund
owing to you on the US return is 100% yours - which is good news, right?

What's up? Dave is in Mexico but I will call Scott and see if he has plans. We might be having a trading group bonding session (dinner and intense drunkeness) on Friday at my boss's hoose but if not I'd love to check out the game. Can I let you know tommorow? Let me know...

Chris

Looks OK except that it doesn't include the reimbursement for my car.

Hi Chris.  I have some information for you about how to bring your car into Canada.  You'll have to do a little leg work, but you will get the  answers you're looking for.

First thing... call the Registrar of Imported Vehicles (RIV) here in Canada (1-888-848-8240 toll free U.S. & Canada).    You'll need the make, model, year, and original purchase price of your car.   This agency will tell you if your car is eligible for import and what if any modifications are required.    Costs associated with this can be reimbursed under your relocation package.

Generally you do not have to pay duty on the car if it originates from the U.S.    You'll have to pay 7% GST on the purchase value (less depreciation if you've had the car more than 30 days) converted into CAD$ using the f/x rate on the date of import.  There are some excise taxes for having an air conditioner ($100) or for a vehicle weighing more than 4,425 pounds.  Costs associated with this can be reimbursed under your relocation package.

Once you have an estimate of the costs for bringing your car here please let us know in case your relocation budget needs to be reviewed.


   This document explains the process in more detail and has an example of the cost calculation.

Talk to you later,

Tamara,

Thanx for the info. I have 17" wheels on it now so I guess I will have to
get wheels and tires. Do you know what the 16" wheels look like? Is there
somewhere on the net I can see an example. Also I will need to have my car
winterized (install a blockheater ect...) when I move back so I will give
you a call then.

   Chris,

   Please disregard my last e-mail. I guess I completely misunderstood your
   message. I just need to know if your tires are 16 or 17 inch. If the are
   17
   inch you will need wheels and tires, but if they are only 16 inch then
   tires
   are all you need. Reason being, it is recommended that the IS300 is
   driven
   with 16 inch tires in the winter time. For pricing you are looking at
   $1686.00+gst
   (17 inch) and $746.00+gst (16 inch). The brand of tires that are
   recommended
   are Michelin Pilot Alpine Roh extreme wheel.
   If you need any other information please e-mail or phone @ (403)291-2111

   Al,

   I am moving to Calgary from Houston and am wondering if Lexus has a
   winter wheel/tire package for the 2001 IS 300. If not could you
   recommend a wheel / tire dealer in Calgary who could help me find
   something that would work. Thanx for your time.
