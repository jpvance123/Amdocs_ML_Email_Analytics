Rick, I have slowed down a little on this, as the comments are not due until Dec.20 and who knows who/what will be by then.  I too think that ENA (notjust EPMI) should file separately from the pipes and PGE.  The LDC issue is important to the gas side, and we take the position that the new definition is good. I am not sure I share Lisa's view that the rules allow the retail function of the electrics to continue to operate outsidethe OATT, but I will scrub this.

I have jury duty today but I hope I get back to the office eventually.  I cancelled my reservations to Houston for your leadership meeting because I didn't want to pay for tickets if I didn't use them, but if it still looks like a go, I will be there. Just keep me posted.

Rick:  

Leslie Lawner is drafting our comments in the Standards of Conduct NOPR.  She estimates that she'll have a draft ready for distribution on November 13th.  

The key issue, of course, is the native load issue.  I'm assuming we'll hit this hard.  Even though FERC is not addressing this issue head on, it is the first time (that I know about) that FERC has expressed an interest in ending the residual - and not insignificant - discrimination that is permitted to exist.  My recommendation to the group is that we support FERC's proposal as a good and long-awaited first step, but it is just that - a first step.  FERC's proposal would eliminate preferential access to information, but what about preferential access to transmission services?   Discrimination will continue until FERC requires all users to be under the same tariff.

Just so you know, my recommendation is that Enron support the application of the standards of conduct to affiliated gas LDCs.  I have heard through the grapevine that certain pipes/LDCs will strongly oppose this proposal.  While I know this isn't our primary issue, I feel it's an important one.  

Lastly, my recommendation to Steve Kean was that EPMI and our pipes/wires file separate comments.  I think this is appropriate for appearance sake (it is an affiliate rulemaking after all), but more importantly because we don't want to dilute our message regarding native load.

I wanted to share my thoughts with you before I depart.  Thanks for listening!

Lisa

Here are my thoughts --

1.	Agree that offering Transmission Provider waiver given RTO status is premature.
2.	Maybe strengthen argument that both unbundled Provider of Last Resort type service and bundled Utility sales service should be included in the affiliate definition.  At a minimum, in places like PA, where the Utility sales service is a direct competitor, there should be no difference with any competitive player.  In a state like GA, where the Utility sales service is a "monopoly" by statue (i.e., bundled retail), I still think given the ability to cogenerate, it makes sense to have these providers take transmission service similar to our service at wholesale.  Maybe make this argument earlier and as the core focus.  I fully agree to include these providers in the definition.
3.	Leslie, call Christi N. to discuss examples of how Native Load Exemption has caused problems (we've put in earlier filings).
4.	The question of "Holding Company, etc." -- We should argue for an exemption.
5.	I am also troubled by the "administer" term.  FERC should prohibit any "helping" by the Transmission Provider of anyone in the marketplace.  Maybe focus FERC on clarifying its positions.
6.	Emergency sections -- Keep the language you have that never applied to natural gas industry (and could be a real problem given a CAISO type situation - ask Alan Comnes for thoughts).  Probably don't object but want to make sure that if Emergency develops there must a pre-set timeframe for going back to normal business.
7.	Everything filed at the FERC related to Standards of Conduct should be posted on the OASIS.

I didn't understand the final bullet point comments.  Is this policy or a statement of something to come?

Jim

Attached for your initial review are Enron Corp. comments on the Marketing Affiliate NOPR (RM01-10).   As you will see, this is an incomplete, bare bones version and we can enhance the arguments once it is clear we all agree with them.  Leslie has struggled mightily with this in light of the constant changes that have been going on and we are sure more changes will be necessary.

Comments must be filed at FERC by December 20.  In order to allow adequate time for a couple of redrafts and the concomitant reviews along with the other things that are going on, please advise me or Leslie of any suggestions, concerns or comments you have by COB MONDAY, NOVEMBER 26th.
