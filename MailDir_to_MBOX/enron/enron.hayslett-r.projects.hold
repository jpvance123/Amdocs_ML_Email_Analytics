Pipeline integrity and safety have risen to new levels of public concern.  In the aftermath of the incidents at Bellingham, Washington and Carlsbad, New Mexico new pipeline safety regulations and legislation will require increased focus on pipeline integrity programs.  As a proactive approach to address these concerns, ETS Operations is establishing a Pipeline Integrity Program Management Group.  This group will be responsible for pipeline integrity issues for EOTT and ETS and financial reporting of EOTT's environmental and remediation projects.  The group will include the following functions:  corrosion, pipeline safety and pipeline integrity.  
 
I am pleased to announce that Mike Nelson will relocate to Houston to lead this new initiative, as Vice President Pipeline Integrity Program Management.  Reporting directly to Mike are Max Brown and Dave Johnson.  
 
The establishment of this new function, along with Mike's move, has given us the opportunity to rotate key staff, allowing us to achieve a broader knowledge base for the future of ETS Operations.  I am pleased to announce the following additional changes:
 
                                                                                 Rick Craig - Vice President Southeast Operations 
                                                                                 Dan Pribble - Vice President Southwest Operations
                                                                                 Randy Rice - Senior Director North Operations 
 
Rick Craig and Dan Pribble will continue to office in Houston.  Randy will transfer to the Omaha office.  
 
Don Hawkins will assume new responsibility for controls & electrical, measurement and the Clifton Machine Shop as Vice President Technical Services.  He will also continue to handle facility audits, quality management, and business development initiatives.  John Shafer, Vice President Environmental, Health & Safety, will continue to be responsible for environmental compliance and remediation, and health and safety.  John Keller, Vice President Planning & Power Services, will assume responsibility for the Beaver Machine Shop in addition to his current responsibilities.  Jerry Martin, Vice President Engineering & Construction, will continue in his current role.
 
The Skill Based Pay Field Training Administration group will now report to Morris Brassfield, Senior Director, Operations Support Services.  
 
All changes will be effective October 1.  Please join me in congratulating these individuals on their new assignments.

Mark your calendar.  The Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, Nov. 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio, Texas.  

This has been an eventful and challenging year for Enron.  As I've said before, we are a company that continues to look to the future, and there are many exciting things on the horizon.  Please join me at this year's conference to plan our strategy and success for the new year and beyond.

Subject: WHAT TO DO IF YOU LOSE YOUR PURSE OR WALLET


Good info sent by a friend:

A corporate attorney sent this out to the employees in his company.
 I pass   it along, for your information.

  WHAT TO DO IF YOU LOSE YOUR PURSE OR WALLET

  We've all heard horror stories about fraud that's committed using your
 name,   address, SS#, credit, etc. Unfortunately I (the author of this
piece
 who   happens to be an attorney) have firsthand knowledge, because my
wallet
 was   stolen last month and within a week the thieve(s) ordered an
expensive
  monthly cell phone package, applied for a VISA credit card,
  had a credit line approved to buy a Gateway computer, received a PIN
 number   from DMV to change my driving record information online, and more.

  But here's some critical information to limit the damage in case this
  happens to you or someone you know. As everyone always advises, cancel
 your   credit cards immediately, but the key is having the toll free
numbers
 and   your card numbers handy so you know whom to call.
  Keep those where you can find them easily. File a police report
 immediately   in the jurisdiction where it was stolen, this proves to
credit
 providers you   were diligent, and is a first step toward an investigation
(if there
 ever is   one).

  But here's what is perhaps most important: (I never ever thought to do
  this). Call the three national credit reporting organizations
 immediately   to place a fraud alert on your name and SS#. I had never
heard of
 doing   that until advised by a bank that called to tell me an application
for
  credit was made over the Internet in my name. The alert means any
 company   that checks your credit knows your information was stolen and
they have
 to   contact you by phone to authorize new credit. By the time I was
 advised to   do this, almost 2 weeks after the theft, all the damage had
been done.

  There are records of all the credit checks initiated by the thieves'
  purchases, none of which I knew about before placing the alert. Since
 then,   no additional damage has been done, and the thieves threw my wallet
 away   this weekend (someone turned it in). It seems to have stopped them
in
 their  tracks.

  The numbers are:
  Equifax: 1-800-525-6285
  Experian (formerly TRW): 1-888-397-3742
  Trans Union: 1-800-680-7289
  Social Security Administration (fraud line): 1-800-269-0271

  We pass along jokes; we pass along just about everything. Do think
  about passing this information along. It could really help someone.

Rod and Kathy,

	Hello to all! How are you guys doing? Great I hope.

	It's been awhile since I last heard from you guys so I
	thought I would drop a short message to you. We are all
	doing pretty well. Lauren has completed her college search
	and has been accepted at Santa Clara University, UC San Diego,
	Univ. of San Diego, Pepperdine and Univ. of Puget Sound. I think
	she'll end up at Puget Sound, she felt most comfortable there.
	She has to decide by May 1st.
	Lauren is in a musical at school this next few weeks. It's called
	the "Wiz". She is singing and dancing, she has a few different
	extra rolls. She is having great fun with it.

	I do not remember any of this when we were thinking of college.
	Things have changed just alittle I think.

	Janet is feeling ok, still having alittle stomach trouble. The
	only thing the Dr's. can think that might be causing this is her
	braces on her teeth. I think that is pretty remote. We'll see
	soon next month when her braces come off. I am doing pretty well
	myself, work has been keeping me busy and I've spent a few extra
	hours out in the yard. I hope to complete the landscaping and
	sprinklers some time this year. (Ha ha!)

	How are KC and Cory doing? School still going ok for them both?

	Well your three (3) homes are probably keeping kathy pretty
	busy these days. It nice that they are all fairly close to
	Houston so you can get away to them as often as you would
	like.

	We went up to Seattle and Tacoma last week to vist Puget Sound,
	I really like the area alot. I never new that Seattle was such a
shopper's paradise! The girls shopped for about two days straight.
	Every store you can think of was in a very small section of
	town. A really fun place to visit.

	I just looked at the time and realized I need to get to work
	this morning. Say hello to all for us and write if you have a
	chance. Be good and happy.

	Love,

	Dave, Janet and Lauren..................

Rod,
how was the holiday. i hope not as exhausting as mine.
i assume that Cindy Olsen has yet to get you an answer.  Enron may get a
little bump in anticipation of a positive earnings release.  This may give
us an opportunity to create some sort of hedge/collar.  Let me know as soon
as you find out.
Erik

How has Enron managed to achieve such success while other energy firms have struggled to deal with the changing market landscape?

Global Change Associates is pleased to announce the publication of a new corporate profile entitled, "Enron 2001: An Inside View".  This objective study takes an insider's look at Enron, specifically, how the firm operates and the keys to its success. Much of the information provided comes from first hand accounts and covers areas such as:

?	The firm's structure and operations
?	The recruitment and training of new employees
?	How Enron empowers and compensates its employees
?	The keys to structuring Enron type "risk free" transactions
?	How to negotiate with Enron

We are launching a number of committees to perform key functions across Enron.  Enron's breadth of activities and nonhierarchal organization make it increasingly necessary to broaden the participation of Enron's next generation of leadership in the important decisions affecting the company.  Broadening participation will result in increased access to information as decisions are made and will allow committee members to extend their working relationships and influence throughout the company.

The committee charters and memberships are set forth below.  Not everyone listed has been contacted in advance.  We urge you to serve if at all possible, but, if you cannot, please contact the committee chair.

VP PRC

The VP PRC will continue to be responsible for evaluating the performance of Enron's Vice Presidents, determining promotions to Vice President, and recommending promotions to Managing Director.  Additionally, the VP PRC will review and propose changes to the PRC process, the performance evaluation criteria and the promotion criteria.

The VP PRC will be chaired by Dave Delainey and its membership is as follows:


Tim Belden	Ben Glisan	Danny McCarty	
Michael Brown	Joe Gold	Jeff McMahon	
Rick Buy	Mark Haedicke	Rob Milnthorp	
Wes Colwell	Jim Hughes	Matthew Scrimshaw	
David Cox	Louise Kitchen	Jeff Shankman	
Janet Dietrich	Michael Kopper	Richard Shapiro	
Dave Duran	John Lavorato	Marty Sunde	
Jim Fallon	Dan Leff		



Analyst/Associate PRC

The analyst/associate PRC will be divided into 3 groups.  Enron Europe will have the same committee evaluate analysts and associates.  This group will be chaired by John Sherriff and its membership is as follows:


Pierre Aury	Kevin Heffron	Andreas Radmacher	
Rob Bayley	Joe Hirl	Stuart Rexrode	
Paul Chivers	Chris Mahoney	Marcello Romano	
Markus Fiala	Christopher McKey	Bjarne Schieldrop	
David Gallagher	Roy Poyntz	Ron Slimp	
Bruce Garner	Paul Quilkey	Rob Stewart	

  


The associate PRC for the Americas will be chaired by Stan Horton and its membership is as follows:


Sally Beck 	Troy Henry	Kevin Presto 	
Jeremy Blachman	Sean Holmes 	Brad Richter 	
Don Black	Sean Long 	Stewart Seeligson	
Dan Castagnola 	Rodney Malcolm	Hunter Shively	
Joe Deffner	Scott Neal 	Jim Steffes 	
Kevin Garland	John Nowlan 	Andy Zipper 	
David Gorte	Ozzie Pagan 		



The analyst PRC for the Americas will be chaired by Steve Kean and its membership is as follows:


Federico Cerisoli 	Mark Jackson 	Everett Plante 	
Jennifer Fraser 	Ben Jacoby 	Paul Racicot 	
Derrick Davies	Steve Jernigan 	Angela Schwarz	
Scott Gahn 	Jay Lewis 	Ed Smida 	
Rod Hayslett	Cheryl Lipshutz 	Jon Thomsen 	
Rogers Herndon 	Michael Mann	Emilio Vicens 	
Brenda Herod 	Ed McMichael 	Frank Vickers 	
Kevin Howard 	Steve Meyers 		




Analyst/Associate Program

The most essential determinant of Enron's continued growth is our ability to attract and develop new talent.  The analyst/associate program has been the biggest contributor to our success in this area.  Charlene Jackson, currently leading our analyst/associate program, has taken a commercial position in EES' account management organization.  We thank Charlene for her hard work and many contributions to the program.  Going forward, this program will be administered by a committee chaired by John Sherriff, CEO of Enron Europe.  The members of this committee are listed below.  Billy Lemmons, currently Vice President of Enron Global Markets, will lead the day-to-day operations of the program. Billy joined Enron in 1992, and has served in a variety of commercial capacities across the company and has been an active participant in the Associate /Analyst program.  Please join us in congratulating Billy on his new responsibilities.


Phillip Allen	Andy Fastow	Eric Shaw	
Robina Barker-Bennett	Kevin Garland	Hunter Shively	
Rick Causey	Ken Rice	Stu Staley	
Joe Deffner			



Culture

We are combining the vision and values, diversity and corporate responsibility committees into a single corporate culture committee chaired by Ken Lay.  Cindy Olson, Beth Tilney and Kelly Kimberly will serve as executive directors of this committee.  This committee will focus on leadership and work-life issues (making it easier to attract and retain the best talent), in addition to continuing the work of the vision and values, diversity and corporate responsibility task forces.  The members of this committee are as follows:


Greg Adams	Louise Kitchen	Mark Palmer	
Shelley Corman	Michael Kopper	Paula Rieker	
Janet Dietrich	Richard Lewis	Jeff Shankman	
Jeff Donahue	Sean Long	Mitch Taylor	
Gene Humphrey	Dan McCarty	Mike Terraso	
Robert Jones	Jean Mrha		


The Corporate Policy Committee will conduct the MD PRC and review the recommendations of the other committees, giving substantial deference to the decisions of those other committees.  We will be forming other committees to deal with other significant functions, tasks and issues facing the company.

Subject:	Mkt Affiliate Implications: Reorganization of Houston and Omaha Facilities Management Responsibilities   



Enron Energy Services is presently a marketing affiliate of several of the Enron pipelines because EES: (1) buys/sells gas; and (2) holds transport contracts on our pipelines.  

Under the FERC's standards of conduct, the pipelines cannot: (1) share transportation information or shipper information with EES; (2) must function independently and keep separate books and records.  Generally, I don't see the FERC having any problem with mechanical, electrical, air-conditioning types of services.  However; there are 2 specific concerns that arise with respect to the described arrangement under the FERC's marketing affiliate standards of conduct:

1. Records -- FERC has ruled that giving a marketing affiliate "access" to transportation and shipper records (including something as simple as file room access) is deemed to be impermissibly sharing the information with a marketing affiliate in violation of the standards. Thus, it seems to me that EES will explicitly not be able to perform any records management function for NNG, TW or NBPL.

2. Billing -  FERC scrutinizes intercompany charges carefully.  In a recent Kinder-Morgan consent order, the FERC used payroll and intercompany charge records to make the case that the pipeline and marketing affiliate did not operate separately.  It would be helpful if any EES facility management charges/allocations come from Enron Facility Services (not EES) --  leaving us room to argue that the facility management subsidiary involves separate functions and staff than the EES subsidiary that is a marketing affiliate.

Subject:	Reorganization of Houston and Omaha Facilities Management Responsibilities


Responsibility  for daily operations of building support services in the Enron Building, Houston leased offices, and Two Pacific Place (Omaha) will be transitioning from Corporate to Enron Energy Services (EES) by year-end.  The areas affected include facility operations and maintenance of mechanical, electrical, and air-conditioning systems; mail delivery;  housekeeping;  food, copier, and records services.

This transition of services, as presently managed by Enron Property and Services Corp. (EPSC), is designed to optimize value to Enron's Business Units by leveraging facility management businesses now offered by EES to their commercial customers.  EPSC staff having administrative responsibility for these services will report to Enron Facility Services, a subsidiary of EES's Global Energy Services group led by Daniel Leff, President and CEO.

EPSC is responsible for Enron's internal real estate and office development needs, including leasing, space allocations and facility planning, project and construction management, furniture systems, and office relocation.  EPSC, in its development role, remains a part of Enron Corporate Administration Services (ECAS) along with Corporate Security and the Aviation Department, reporting to Bill Donovan, Vice President, Corporate Administrative Services.

This alignment of responsibilities offers the opportunity for EPSC to focus resources on effective utilization of our existing office space assets and managing the development of Houston's new Enron Center Campus project.

Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses.

This reorganization will allow EGS to focus our resources on opportunities that present the highest value to Enron.  It will also accomplish the following:  1) enhanced synergies among our assets and personnel, 2) more effective prioritization of business opportunities, and 3) better management of Enron's asset-based businesses throughout the world.

Enron Global Services' energy asset portfolio includes the North American pipeline businesses of Enron Transportation Services (ETS), including Northern Border; the international pipeline, power and distribution operations of Enron Global Assets & Services (EGAS); Portland General Electric; EOTT Energy Corp; Enron Wind; Azurix and Wessex Water.  

Reporting to me as the heads of their respective business units are:
?	Jim Hughes, President & COO - EGS/International
?	Danny McCarty, Managing Director & CCO - ETS
?	Bill Cordes, President - Northern Border Partners
?	Peggy Fowler, President & CEO - Portland General Electric
?	John Garrison, President & CEO - Azurix
?	Dana Gibbs, President & COO - EOTT Energy Corp
?	Colin Skellett, CEO - Wessex Water
?	Adam Umanoff, President & CEO - Enron Wind

With the creation of EGS, we hope to enhance the efficient utilization of our commercial support services.  To accomplish this, EGS' staff and operational functions will be headed by:
?	Rod Hayslett, Managing Director & CFO 
?	Rob Walls, Managing Director & General Counsel 
?	Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Pipeline Operations and Engineering & Construction
?	Brian Stanley, President & CEO - EEOS
?	Steve Hotte, Vice President & CIO
?	John Ambler, Vice President, Communications & PR	
?	Gary Smith, Vice President, Human Resources

In addition, Rob Walls will continue to perform his role as Deputy General Counsel for Enron reporting to Jim Derrick.

Phil Lowry will be responsible for domestic pipeline operations, technical services and engineering & construction, as well as, international pipeline technical services and engineering & construction.  Brian Stanley will be responsible for technical services and engineering & construction for international power and distribution facilities.  

Below is an organization chart for Enron Global Services, which displays the changes described here.  We are confident this new organization will focus our talent and capital appropriately.  Please join me in supporting this management team as it strives to maximize Enron's return on its assets.

Rod-Many thanks for helping me out with SABIC. It was nice to host them on my turf rather than look across the table at a bunch of guys in dish dashes. I've gotten great feedback and we're a step closer in landing them as a partner. Thanks again.

Hello Rod,

Thank you for your e-mail.  I understand that you receive an error in
moving a file when installing USB software.

Please do the following to test the USB ports:

Checking the Device Manager in normal mode

1.  On your screen, locate and click the Start button.  From the Start
menu, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

Note: In Windows Me on the left side of Control Panel, you may have
to click View all Control Panel Options to see all of the icons.

2.  In Control Panel, double-click the System icon.

3.  In the System Properties dialog box, click the Device Manager tab.

a.  Verify that everything is recognized and properly configured.

b.  Check the Other Devices category and verify that it is properly
configured.

Note: It is not uncommon for the Device Manager to display a phantom COM
port under Ports (COM and LPT) for certain motherboards and BIOS
versions.  This phantom COM port is necessary for the modem to be
recognized in this situation.  It is likely that the phantom port has a
yellow exclamation point on it.  This is not a device conflict and is
the normal configuration for the motherboard and BIOS.

If the USB ports are properly recognized, then this is a software issue.
Gateway does not support third party hardware or software.  Please
contact the manufacturer for further support in installing their
product.

Thank you for choosing Gateway.

Original message follows:
-------------------------

It does seem strange that my installs are failing on all of new hardware
that I have tried to add to the system with USB connections.   Not just
one of the pieces.   And all of them return the same error.    What are
the chances of that one?
