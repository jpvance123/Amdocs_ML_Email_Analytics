Grace,
Hello, were very excited that you have decided to except our invitation!!
Due to the large traffic of companies that week because of the business
career fair, we will be having two speakers at the meeting on September 26
(your company and Enterprise).  Since Enterprise accepted first we will have
them present first.

We were thinking that we would a lot you both up to 45 minutes.  It doesn't
have to be that long though.  Feel free to present whatever you would like.
Some examples of what you could talk about... your companies history,
positions recruiting for, what your looking for in a candidate, what a makes
a resume stand out, a questions and answer section, etc.

Feel free to bring treats, or little company toys like the ones handed out
at job fairs.  I think Enterprise was thinking about bringing pizza.

Feel free to contact me with any other questions.  I will get in touch with
you when the date gets closer to finalize everything.

Sincerely,
Colleen Gibson

Time:		8:00am - 5:00pm
Location:		2WTC Oregon Room
What to bring:	Pen (or pencil) and paper
Other items:	Course materials provided at start of class
			Breakfast and Lunch will be provided both days

Course Description
This course builds on our Applied Energy Derivatives program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective.  Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring / marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.  Applied Energy Derivatives, or its equivalent is a prerequisite for this program; no other advanced preparation is required.  CPE Credits: Accounting & Auditing 2; Consulting Services 1; Management 1; Specialized Knowledge & Applications 12.

At the conclusion of this course, participants will be able to:
Decipher the role of the price curve, volatility, and time in determining the intrinsic value and time value of an option premium
Understand how a dealer 'trades volatility' and dynamically hedges an option
Recognize the limitations of traditional option pricing models when applied to energy
Annualize a periodic (e.g. monthly) volatility and vice versa
Create synthetic puts and calls using put-call parity to exploit mispriced options
Incorporate volatility term structures, "smiles and skews", in analyzing deals
Establish a delta-neutral hedge of an option and calculate the cost of changing prices on that hedge position
Comprehend the relationship between gamma and actual price volatility and its consequent implications for a dealer's earnings
Anticipate the irregular changes in gamma by stress testing option portfolios, thereby allowing more informed position management
Interpret an aggregated risk management report for an option portfolio and the positive or negative values for delta, gamma, theta, vega and rho
Structure an option on a swap to create innovative hedges for customers
Create extendable and cancelable fixed price deals
Embed a swaption sale to create sub-index physical supply to a user
Compare the merits and earnings opportunities among various alternatives available to a customer seeking to reverse an existing swap position
Determine the cash value of a swap terminated before its end date
Apply swaps with off-market fixed prices to monetize value in existing contracts or to provide for the cash/borrowing needs of a customer
Combine off-market swaps in complex structures: e.g. "blend-and-extend"

Effective with the November 15 payday, electronic viewing and printing of
your direct deposit advice will be available on eHRonline.  This new
feature allows you to view your pay information at a time convenient for
you.  Later this year, you will be able to view this information from your
home on your ClickAtHome computer.

The following is information to help you view this document beginning on
November 15.  To access and print your pay advice from eHRonline:

     1.   Log-on to eHRonline with your "P" number and password.
     For more details on how to log-on to eHRonline, see
     step-by-step instructions at
     http://isc.enron.com/site/doclibrary/user/
     2.   Navigate to the pay advice using the following navigation
     menus:
?    Pay Information
?    Paycheck Inquiry
     3.   Select the appropriate payroll period.
     4.   Click on the Continue button.
     5.   Click on the payroll period link under the Period heading;
     a new window opens.
     6.   Select the Open this file from its current location option.
     7.   Click on the OK button; this starts Adobe Acrobat Reader.
     8.   View your pay advice.
     9.   Click on the Print icon from the main toolbar.
   10.    Verify/change the displayed printer.
   11.    Click on the OK button to print the pay advice at the
     designated printer.  For more details on how to view & print
     your pay advice from eHRonline, see step-by-step
     instructions at http://isc.enron.com/site/doclibrary/user/

The advice information will remain on this site throughout the year
allowing you to view or print the information at your convenience.  You can
view a sample of the online pay stub by following this link to
http://hrweb.enron.com/, click on Payroll Services and then on Payroll
Forms.

If you'd like more details, there will be an Information Booth on November
13 through 15 from 11 am to 2 pm in the lobby of Enron North.  Come by and
visit with Payroll Representatives who will demonstrate how the process
works.

Dear Grace,

I hope your summer is giving you some opportunities to enjoy nice weather.

We've had an interesting inquiry from a national business publication;
they're looking for stories about people who've been through our negotiation
courses who feel the course played a significant role in their professional
-- or personal lives.

Can you think of anyone from Enron/Portland who might be interested in being
interviewed?

Please give my regards to the 'gang'.  I look forward to working with you
again.

Cordially,
Steve

Bill: I've checked the information for the WSU Student Marketing meeting on 9/26, and it will take place at the WSU campus (so: no driving to Lacey, WA!). I have not yet heard back from the president of the organization, but will let you know the details when I find out what they are. The meeting begins at 7:00pm on the 26th--drive down that morning? I'll follow-up with you later.

Here is the G&A Expense worksheet to use as a guide for next year's budget.  I've tried to put as many notes into your assumptions as I could find.  For the 2002 plan, I already input salaries adjusted for merit increases (4.25%) and special pays.  Please update the rest of the 2002 plan column and enter all assumptions used to calculate the amounts.  Some examples of assumptions are if you know you are going to attend certain conferences, have a customer outing, plan travel expense per employee, or add additional headcount.  If you could please complete this and send back to me by the end of the week, it would be greatly appreciated.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

 




Thanks,
David Vandor

Importance:	High

			Open Enrollment for your 2002 Health Benefits begins Monday, October 29, 2001!  

Q. 	WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
A. 	If you plan to make changes to your existing benefit coverage, you will need to make changes during Open Enrollment which begins 	Monday, October 29, 2001 at 8:00 AM (Central) and ends on November 12, 2001 at 5:00 PM (Central)
	
	To facilitate these changes, you received an Open Enrollment Benefit Packet at your home address.  This packet contains a personalized 	worksheet and the Enron Instruction Guide to help you make your selections.  
	(If you have not received your Info Packet, please let us know ASAP! ) 


Q.	WHAT DO I NEED TO DO?
	1.  If you are satisfied with your current elections and do not need to make changes, do nothing.  Your current choices will automatically roll 	over to 2002. 

	2.  If you plan to make changes to your coverage, you will need to either access the Intranet website at work:  benefits.enron.com    
	or at home at  www.Enron.BenefitsNow.com   or call the Phone Enrollment Line at (800) 332-7979, Option 5.


Q. 	I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS.  I NEED MORE INFORMATION. 
A.	If you have more questions or need more information, you may attend our Open Enrollment "Brown Bag" Info Session being held on Friday, 	October 26 @ 11:30 PM in the Mt Hood Conference Room.  

See you then!

You have been selected to interview Real Time Candidate Darrin Presto (brother of VP Kevin Presto). Darrin has indicated that he would be available to interview early next week. 

With that in mind, I would like to set up the interviews to take place on Tuesday, July 10th, beginning around 10:00am. Each interview would last about 45 minutes (max), so the last interview would finish around 1:45pm. If you are aware of any conflict with this day/time, please let me know as soon as possible. I would like to finalize this schedule today.

If you have any questions, please let me know!

Thanks,
Grace

Grace -

Please schedule an interview for this candidate to meet with me, Bill and anyone else that Bill recommends.   We need to treat this one 'right' - he is the brother of a VP in Houston........

Thanks!

Attached is Darrin Presto's resume. I have met Darrin in the past and based upon my first impression he would be a good candidate for real time. Please set up an interview.

This information was sent by Tim Belden and Chris Calger earlier in the year. I am sending it again for the benefit of our new hires and as a reminder to be responsible while enjoying this evening's event.

============

Over the last couple of years we have had numerous social events including holiday parties, post-quarterly meeting outings, and going away parties. While I hope that people thoroughly enjoy themselves, I ask that you keep in mind that we all have to act professionally and responsibly during and after these events. I have been working with Chris Calger and Amy FitzPatrick to put together some guidelines for company-sponsored social events:

The company will provide soft drinks, beer and wine. You may choose to order other beverages at your expense.
Functions will run for a specified period of time. If there is an open bar, we will establish a time certain after which Enron will not pay for any additional drinks.
If you require assistance getting home, please contact a taxi and submit the fare for expense reimbursement with no questions asked. The last thing in the world we want is to have people break the law or put their safety and the safety of others in jeopardy.

============

PLEASE NOTE: We now have cab vouchers available for our company events. Please check with your admin assistant to obtain a voucher, or see me at the event--no questions asked.

Thanks,
Grace
