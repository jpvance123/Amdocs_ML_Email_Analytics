Cindy,
Will you please add my new Administrative Assistant to your future "cc" lists?  She is Sarita Garza.  Thanks so much.  John

P.S.  I have asked Sarita and Amelia to get with you and see when a favorable date would be that Phil Lowry and I could have about 30 minutes with Stan to go over the "Operations Alliances" with him (since his half day staff meeting was cancelled for May 16).  Anyway, this is just a heads-up that they will be in touch to get a date confirmed.  Thank you.  JHS

Thanks but I will pass for now.  I wouldn't mind looking at some muni's with shorter maturity dates though.  I am concerned about long-term yields increasing which would mean bond prices decreasing.  Doesn't it make since to go with shorter maturity dates ri8ght now?

The Muni desk called to say they are seeing a blip in the market and are
seeing  5 1/4% at par around 2021 to 2025. They think those rates won't
last.

They called about your portfolio because your ladder is is thin in those
years.

You have some cash. If you have an interest give me a call. I can fax your
maturity concentration schedule  to you if you need it. I didn't want to
send your portfolio info by fax  without your permission.

Subject:	Re: Business Review

I agree that makes a lot of sense, that is certainly where we are spending our
time, and good management of that so far, is what is contributing to earnings
higher than expected....that and the crazy California markets. We're always
glad to have you visit, and could provide a detailed discussion if that's what
you would prefer. We are spending a great deal of time on this in the sales
presentations and have a number of overheads, and some written information
that we use in our position meetings that we could send to you to start with.
The rate case is in a very dynamic state, but we believe moving in right
direction. The power position is in constant review based on projected loads,
demand side management opportunities, and blocks of energy available at
reasonable prices in the future for our customers. We are still operating
under an obligation to serve, as we don't see that changing anytime in the
near future and those utilities in the west that have gotten in trouble are
those who haven't provided for customers. Commissions seem to be giving rate
increases for increasing prices if prudent management was attempted, but not
just for stopping based on possible belief of dereg. We have a sharing
mechanism right now that shares risks and rewards between customers and
shareholders. During this sales process we had spent a lot of time working
through with Sierra on this, and now with the new possible buyers. Most like
it when they finally understand. It is not regulation 101, it is very complex
and leading edge, but get the risks and rewards aligned much better for
shareholdes and customers. Doesn't fit Enron's view of dereg, but Oregon will
not get to Enron's view anytime soon, especially with California situation,
and it's not just Oregon regulators, it's Oregon customers including the
industrials that are  reliability sensitive like high techs and health care. 
Sorry for the long note....how about if I start by sending you some
information from presentations, and then we can look at schedules for when a
meeting might work. You might even want to come to one of the banker
presentations. Mark M and Mitch were both in Seattle yesterday, and could
share with you some of the discussion related to these subjects. Mitch thought
we might have another in a week or so.....      

>>> Horton, Stanley 05/08/01 09:37AM >>>
After returning home and reviewing the material handed out at the PGE business
review, there are two areas that I think I need to understand better.  The
first is PGE's energy positions going forward and the financial exposures to
changing prices.  The second is the rate case.  I would be happy to return to
Portland to get a more in depth review with a much smaller cast of players.  I
am open to suggestions from you.

Given the status of the divestiture process, Jeff wants to make sure he (and
subsequently I) have a good handle on these two important issues.

Thanks!

May 7, 2001


Stan Horton
Chairman and Chief Exective Officer

Dear Mr. Horton:

Thank you for your letter of congratulation on my recent retirement.

I would like to make a suggestion, for the retirement plan for others.

        When the 27 page retirement letter is sent, that a time table of
when items will be in place or transferred         be included. (3-9
months or when)

        Medical Forms can't be put in now until after you leave.  I went
back to the office to HR and they put         the information in the
system.  Two weeks after I left I called to see when I would receive the
card (Dr.         offices like to see the card).  I was tolled I wasn't
even in the system.  So I called back to Omaha HR         and they worked
to get it in place.  When I went to get a RX  I was not in that system
either and had to         come home and call HR and start over with that
system.

        The only part of the funds that are transferred as of this date
is the Cash Balance Plan.  The Savings         Plan and ESOP are not
transferred to my Financial Plan.  They tell me they will be; this is why
I feel           a timeline would be helpful.  Until I received my
Medical Card I put off going to the Dr.  Also I haven't         wanted to
take a trip because, I am unsure of when funds will be transferred.

         Last week I received a letter from a transfer Company out of NY.
with (2) shares of  ENRON                 stock.  So I called NY to see
what Fund that was from,  they didn't know they were just to set up a
    account.  I called the Enron retirement line and they didn't know
what Fund that was from either.

        Many of the people who answers the phones about any of this just
don't have answers.

ENRON employees have been well taken care of while we are working, this
doesn't seem like that in retirement.  I share this because I know your
are always working to improve ENRON.

Sincerely,

Jean Mohring

We cannot afford a communications or performance breakdown.  I am looking to you to insure that one does not happen.

Stan, thanks for the comments.  With regard to EOTT, we plan to keep the same attention and focus on all of the EOTT initiaitives.  I'm a little bit surprised by your comment that they didn't know because I talked with Dana the day after I announced it at Phil's staff meeting.  Obviously something broke down somewhere and I need to keep that in mind in the future.  

Relative to your second concern, I'd be less than honest with you if I told you that I don't have the same concern.  Phil and I discussed this at some length but since his work on the international side was winding down and Hawkins really didn't have anything for him going forward we thought his measurement background and technical knowledge might be a fit here.  Don and I talked to Lohit at some length about the communications and relationship building required for him to be successful in the job and he felt he could handle it.  I plan to stay on top of it.  If I see the communications and/or relationships that are required for this job breaking down, I plan to deal with them quickly through the performance mangement process.  Hope this answers your questions.

Are you sure Lohitt is the right person to do this job.  What about EOTT?  No one at EOTT even knew that Steve was leaving before I told them last week.  Communication skills are crucial in this job and I never thought that was one of Lohitt's strong skills,

Subject:	Wessex Water


Stan,

I met with Colin Skellet, Wessex Water CEO, last week and we agreed that
Wessex Water and Enron Direct should help each other going forward.  Wessex
will provide ED with its I&C database and, should Wessex decide to enter
into the residential power and gas market, ED could provide site
registration and gas/power price risk management services to sit behind the
Wessex brand.

Given that Wessex is Enron's biggest retail platform in Europe, have you
given any thought as to how it could be closer integrated with Enron Direct
generally?  Given current market conditions, I expect Enron will have
little choice but to hold onto Wessex for the time being which isn't
necessarily a bad thing.

There could obviously be some regulatory issues in bringing our retail
water and energy businesses together, though I think it is worth looking
at.  ED has 150,000 I&C customers across the UK, making it a good fit for
Wessex.  Also, if the Water market opens up to competition in the future,
there would be benefits for Wessex.

I look forward to discussing ideas with you when you are over in June.

Matthew

I would appriciate if you would send to me each week the PGE Position Report.  Also, at your convenience I would like to spend some time via telephone to run through the report to make sure I understand just what is being reported.  I'll have my assistant call to set-up the phone call early next week.

Also, to whom in Risk Management do you send the position report?

Thanks.

Unfortunately I am not going to be able to accept your generous offer to attend the Indy 500.  My wife and I have 1 year-old twins and I was hoping to get our Nanny to pull some week-end duty to help my wife with them as I went to the races.  Unfortunately I was not successful in doing that.  Leaving her to look after two infants while I attend the races didn't seem right.  Thanks for the invitation!

Subject:	EOTT Hunt Pipeline Update

Stan & Phil - a quick update on the status of our activities on EOTT's Hunt Pipeline this week.

o	On Monday, Jordan and David Sztroin drove as much of the pipeline as possible in preparation for Tuesday's meeting.
o	On Tuesday, Jordan, David and Dan Cole met with representatives from Boots Smith Construction in Laurel, MS to discuss the project.  Discussion centered around the pipe size (10" being the most likely), and what was included in the lump sum construction price from Boots Smith.
o	His price did not include a number of items, such as concrete coating, stream crossings, wetlands installation (including mats), directional drills, silt fencing, and several other identified items.  He has provided, or will provide, unit prices for some of these items; we will estimate the balance.  In addition, his price is for construction now, and could change if construction is delayed too long - how long is not defined.
o	He stated he was not interested in a total "wrap" turnkey project.  He works closely with an engineering company, but did not feel comfortable doing the entire project, including surveying, ROW, engineering, permitting, procurement, etc.  His price is only for normal construction.
o	On Wednesday, Jordan, David, Dan and I held a conference call.  I assured Dan that we would, as always, be diligent in trying to minimize cost and schedule while maintaining appropriate safety, quality and environmental parameters.

I have assigned Jordan as the Project Director for the project.  He is working to more clearly define the scope, standards, specifications, execution approach, cost and schedule.  We will advise the target schedule and revised cost estimate as soon as possible.  Of course, there are many permitting and environmental issues to overcome, and Jordan is working through those now; the survey needs to start ASAP in order to file for the permits.

Dan, if you have comments on my notes, or on the meeting, please let us know.  We're looking forward to working with you.

Thanks,
Jerry

Q2 earnings report looks very good!  Congratulations.  I will keep it quiet until you are sure of the numbers. We should let Causey and Hayslett know for planning purposes ASAP. 

Given the recent events related to the proposed sale do you think it is even worth discussing the Benefits issue with Corporate?

Also, have we finalized all of the divestiture/retention deals?

Have a good week.  Thanks.

After returning home and reviewing the material handed out at the PGE business review, there are two areas that I think I need to understand better.  The first is PGE's energy positions going forward and the financial exposures to changing prices.  The second is the rate case.  I would be happy to return to Portland to get a more in depth review with a much smaller cast of players.  I am open to suggestions from you.

Given the status of the divestiture process, Jeff wants to make sure he (and subsequently I) have a good handle on these two important issues.

Thanks!

It was so nice to hear from you.  I am glad all is well.  I am glad the new home is being enjoyed and that you have a job that you like.  I am anxious to get the news of the birth of your new grandchild.  Please let us know as soon as possible after the Geraldine delivers.  Also let us know what hospital she is in where we can send an appropiate gift to mother and child.  My best to you and your family.

Dear Stanley:
  Before hand I'll let you know that we are doing great back home at Down
Under. We have bought our new home and are enjoying it completly. We
receives the photos that you sent us of the twins and we must congradulate
you that they are absolutly beautiful.
  Please let us know how you and the family are doing. I'll let you know
that I'm working doing a small delivery job for a Bakers Factory, nothing to
do with what I was doing but I like it just the same. It's a very early
start but I finish before lunch and that gives me time to look for a part
time job in the afternoon. After I spoke with Paul in the meeting, he said
that he was going to introduce me to other companies from the field, but I
haven't heard from him since then. I won't lose my hope to work for Enron
some day.
  Geraldine is doing fine and has two weeks left before the baby's due,
Chris is doing very good at school and keeping up very well with his soccer
training and Vicky is doing fine also and very happy with what's going on.
Do you still watch Stock Car racing? Let us know how things are going
because we haven't got cable tv yet so we are pretty left out on sport news.
  Hope to hear from you real soon, here's my new address so we can send
letters apart from mailing.
         8 BENNISON ROAD, HINCHINBROOK - N.S.W. - 2168
              PH:(02) 8783 9273
  Our kindest regards for you and to the rest of the family and a special
kiss to the twins.
                      Dario and family

Hello Stan,

Couple of people called me to inquire about Enron's interest in investing in a methane car kit and filling infrastructure.  They wanted to submit an unsolicited proposal to Enron.  I indicated to the that I would first check to see if Enron would be interested in a venture of this type.  According to these two gentlemen the return on investment is very good, ranging from 15% -  40%.  

Would Enron be interested in this type of business?

Regards,

Henry

You asked for a time line on securing this quote.  

I have already discussed the general concept with Marsh Mac and a bit of strategy on how we would approach this with AIG.  

Lou,  I need you to give me the data that we have available on these lines.  As I mentioned to you, I want to go to the carrier  with what I have to offer them instead of them dictating to me what they want.   Until I get this I am strictly talking in a vacuum and can get nothing moving forward.  

After that, I would think that I could have a quote from them within 30 days..I will shoot for better than that.  I feel however that this quote/due diligence will be much more intensive on their part  given their experience with EOTT,  I can definitely ask for an answer within a specified time frame.  Is 30 days acceptable? 

 Hope this answers your questions.  If not please let me know.

Dear Board Task Force,
Bill Boswell also noted the following conversation that occurred today:

"Rae -- and just to fill in the blanks, Betsy Moler called this morning to say
that Mike McGrath had called her seeking support for his position.  She told
him his position was wrong and that the EEI board members wanted to work on
the strawman first and to have something to look at in June on that - not
the retail quadrant - although the two efforts could proceed at the same
time.  Owens and I agreed to talk on Monday following the NERC meeting to
set up an EEI/GISB board level meeting ASAP.  Mike will not be a part of
that effort; Dave Owens will. -- Bill"


Thanks, Rae

It would be better if Scot contacted EBS directly about a meeting.  Kevin Hannon would be the right person.  Kevin is the President and COO.  I have no idea about whether they are in need of Spectrum's services or not.  Let me know when you plan to be in Dallas.  My daughter has a horse show (we own three Arabian Horses that she shows) in Fort Worth in mid June and I will try to get up there for at least some of it.

Stan;
I got your letter and company info, thanks. By the way, our President, Scott
Brown, is going to be in Dallas on the 16th and 17th of May making a
presentation to Worldcom. I thought I would check with you to see if any of
your people with Enron Broadband might be able to meet briefly with Scott on
the 15th (Tuesday) or 18th (Friday, which would be better) in Houston to
discuss our services. If they can meet just let me know dates and times and
I'll coordinate with Scott.

I still plan to be in Dallas to see Hugh King sometime in mid to late June,
and I will plan to stop down in Houston while I'm there and we can try to
get together. Thanks,

Terry

As you probably know, I have accepted a position as Regulatory Analyst reporting to Joe Hartsoe.  My last day in Houston is June 29 and I will start my new responsibilities on July 16.

By means of this message I want to thank you for making this possible.  This is a big challenge for me and opens a new spectrum of possibilities in a completely different arena.

I am looking forward to being a part of the ETS team.

Thanks again,

Karina

Subject:	Weekly Update May 7-11, 2001 

-Presentation to potential buyer went well. Questions mostly around power
supply trading, and risk/reward formula with customers and shareholders, that
is in agreement with OPUC.
-California's rolling black-outs have pushed up prices in the West, allowing
opportunities for PGE to continue to sell into the market.
-All IOUs, State Agencies (OR,ID,WA), Power Councils, BPA, and security
coordinator met to address emergency preparedness. There is beginning to be
heightened concern about Fall and Winter supply.
-Union negotiations continued, and progress was made understanding needs and
issues. Next meeting scheduled for May 21. Union seems to be in no hurry, and
needs for time to get interests aligned.
-De-reg Bill continues to be uncertain. It has become a political football,
where legislatures are convinced, who ever carries or doesn't carry forward,
depending on future power situation, will determine which party ends up in
majority, and as governor in the state. Politics....ugh
-Final contracts should be received tomorrow. Will work to turn them around as
quickly as possible, but I know people will need a few days with them, and a
few more issues may need to be addressed. There are some employment
agreements, and other contracts that were put in place by others, that have
created some benefits, that people feel they are giving up with new
agreements. Some is perception, some is real, some is lack of trust for
Enron's  intent, when things are not written precisely.

Subject:	Azurix

Stan, 
Today is Diane Bazelides' last day of work at Azurix. Over the last month, Diane and I have met several times to transition the Azurix Public Relations function into ETS. Shelley and I also met with John Garrison. As you know, Azurix has a lot of irons in the fire and many of them could turn into public relations challenges. 
Azurix has PR employees in Buenos Aires, Ontario, and California. These employees were notified by Diane that I was taking over the Azurix PR function and to coordinate their activity through me. I've spoken to a few of the PR employees.
To summarize what Azurix might face in the near future, here's what Diane and John provided me and Shelley: 
?	Offers to purchase Azurix North America are due May 24. John anticipates spending one month reveiwing the offers and making management presentations. As a deal is done and made public, information and responses to the media will be coordinated with Mark Hudson in Ontario. 
?	The Madera project in California continues. Cole Frates is on the ground in California and I will coordinate with Cole as issues surface. 
?	Gustavo Pedace is on the ground in Buenos Aires. If I had to guess, this is where Azurix has the most exposure. As July and August approach, we'll know more about the direction of Azurix Buenos Aires. 
?	As things transpire with the other assets, I'll coordinate PR activity with the contacts on the ground. Mark Palmer and his staff know that ETS is involved in Azurix. 
I have a phone call into John Shafer to discuss the use of the crisis center in case of an Azurix emergency. This is a precautionary measure that I hope we don't have to use.
Please let me know if you would like to discuss Azurix and the PR function further. 
Gina

I know of no changes we need to make to the Board or to the Committee assignments. I will check with Mr. Lay's office to make sure he wants to remain on the Board.  I will do that today and have an answer by tomorrow in all probability.

In advance of the May meeting of EOTT's Board of Directors, EOTT's sole shareholder signs a written consent providing for the annual election of EOTT's directors.  At the May meeting, the Board of Directors elects committee members and chairs for the next 12 months.  Are either of you aware of any upcoming changes in the composition of EOTT's Board of Directors?  In the past, we have had directors who have stepped down immediately prior to the "annual meeting."    Please advise me early next week as to whether there will be any changes to EOTT's Board of Directors in order that I may have the appropriate consent of sole shareholder signed.

Dan Whitty (Chairman), Ted Gaylord, and Dee Osborne are the current members of the Audit Committee.  John Duncan (Chairman), Dee Osborne, and Dan Whitty are the current members of the Compensation Committee.  Will there be any changes to these committees?

Thank you for your help.

I would appriciate if you would send to me each week the PGE Position Report.  Also, at your convenience I would like to spend some time via telephone to run through the report to make sure I understand just what is being reported.  I'll have my assistant call to set-up the phone call early next week.

Also, to whom in Risk Management do you send the position report?

Thanks.

Mr. Horton,

We appreciate your time a few weeks ago and sincerely hope we were able to
clearly convey our disciplined investment approach to you during our
meeting.    We also hope we were able to help you to re-define the term
"risk".   Using our disciplined approach, we have been able to provide our
clients with consistent returns
and avoid negative returns over the course of the past 10 years.  We credit
the success to developing and implementing a very focused and structured
investment plan.

At this point, we would like to have your permission to put together a
proposal for a portfolio which would be constructed upon the same philosophy
and guidelines utilized by Yale University's multi-billion dollar endowment
fund.    The purpose of the proposal would be to show you how we build our
client portfolios
in an attempt to minimize ( if not eliminate ) negative annual returns while
providing above market returns.

We know you would find the proposal interesting and would give you better
insight into how
high net worth individuals, endowments and wealthy family groups construct
their investment
portfolios.

We look forward to hearing back from you.  Have a great day.


Sincerely,


William L Swearingen II  /  Vice President		David J. Swearingen

Peggy:

Considering where we are in the divestiture process, I don't think it is the right time to have PGE contract for and administer the Health and Welfare Benefits noted in your memo dated 04/20/01.  In addition, it is likely that a potential buyer would want PGE to come under its own Health and Welfare Benefits.  Switching now could entail having PGE employees being under three Plans in a relatively short period of time.

Thanks for the report.  The level of detail was on target.  Let me know when you want to discuss comp issues.

Subject:	EWC - Weekly Update/Week Ending 27 April


1.  Aura.
     -  Received revised bid from UBS which Metts describes as "real."  UBS
will now commence detailed 6-8 week due diligence on EWC (at Enron's
expense if deal busts).  Confidence re: UBS' ability to execute remains
mixed.
     -  LJM (Fastow) interest continues, but unclear how parallel process
can be run.  Umanoff concerned about conflict when management assists
seller as part of UBS deal but assists buyer as part of LJM deal.
     -  Now that '01 numbers scrubbed, in process of revising '02 financial
projections based on detailed internal review (as of December, 2000, '02
EBITDA projected at approximately $115mm; up from 1CE '01 projection of
$78mm). This is unrealistic; I expect 2002 EBITDA in the $90-95mm range,
showing solid 15-20% EBITDA growth.

2.  M&A Activity.
     -  acquisition of assets of bankrupt Dutch blade manufacturer, Aerpac,
continues; we have closed on several assets and expect final closing in
May.
     -  sale of Greek operating projects to German buyer continues, but
execution uncertain.  Closing targeted for June 30.  Sale of Greek
development company also launched, with 2 parties expressing interest.

3.  2001 Commercial Activity.
     -  US backlog remains firm.  Projected demand continues to exceed our
projected turbine supply.  Key execution issue is confimation of
suitability of 1.5 MW turbine (primarily its gearbox) in more rigorous US
wind regimes.
     -  American Electric Power has provided indicative bid to purchase the
two Texas projects we have under development (Indian Mesa I and Clear Sky);
indicative bid price is attractive.  AEP has requested Enron Corp guaranty
of EWC's turbine warranty, like they have received on previous sales with
EWC.  Enron Corp guaranty is approved internally, but, in light of Aura,
we will continue to bargain for no Enron Corp credit support. Finally, debt
financing expected to close on IMI in May and debt circled on Clear Sky in
June.  Turbine suitability due diligence is key pacing item for debt
closing.
     -  European backlog remains firm, expect for Spanish sales of 750kw
turbine, which remains soft. EWC attended Hannover Fair last week, the
largest industrial trade show in Europe.  Our exhibit was very well
received.  CEO of German competitor, Enercon, approached Umanoff to discuss
IP issues (Enercon is currently barred from US market on patent
infringement grounds).

4.  HR Issues.
     -  US has lost O&M director and 2 key commercial employees have
expressed concerns.  Need to finalize retention program (Umanoff to discuss
with Horton early in week).
     -  Key recruiting initiatives are: GM Spain; head of global
procurement/blade MFG; European GC.  Umanoff would also like to re-visit
hiring US GM/MD, as day-to-day US operations require more detailed
oversight than Umanoff is currently providing; not clear if we can recruit
for this position in the midst of Aura.

Stan - for the future, please let me know whether this is the right level
of focus.  Talk with you soon. Adam

Corporate comp is relooking at your contract based on our converstion..ieyou would be entitled to severance payment eqyual to 2 year salary and bonus should you decide to leave the company provided that all or substantially all of the Azurix assts other than ?Wessex and Azurix Bu7enos Aires are sold.

I will meet with Jim Derrick today to discuss John Ale.

With regard to Beckett and Glasford; their agreements provide for retention bonuses provided they stay until September 16th.  If they voluntarily leave before that they get nothing.  There is no employment agreements in place that link anything to comparable positions titles or anything else.  Should we move them over to Enron in Director positions and they are subsequently offerred positions elsewhere in Enron ( once we dispose of non-Wessex and ABA assets) at Director positions, then they have a choice of  accepting those positions or voluntarily terminating.  Since there is no contractual agreements with these two I do not want to offer any kind of enhanced severance payments to them.  I have contacted Ben Glisan regarding Glasford and he is polling his people about their view on an appropiate placement for him.

I will talk with you when you return.

Thanks.

just over looked it.  Just in case however,  I reserved a 9:45 am on the New

I bought 5,000 units of Northern Border Partners at $39.56 with part of the proceeds.  The roughly $975K is correct.  Thanks.  Any ideas on the cash?  I was thinking about $800k in munis and $800k in S&P 500 index fund.  Your thoughts.

Subject:	Project Timber

I am preparing the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act filing for Enron Corp. in connection with the sale of the MTBE/Isomerization facility to EOTT Energy Partners, L.P.  I believe that the filing should be made by this Friday, May 25 in order to be sure that the 30 day waiting period will expire before the anticipated closing date of June 29.  Please read the attached memo which requests that each of you look through your files to determine whether or not you possess the types of documents described in the memo.  I would be happy to discuss any questions that you may have regarding whether or not particular documents in your files would be responsive to this request.  Since Enron needs to make this filing by Friday, it is important that you respond to the memo by Thursday, May 24.

The normal process is to have him interviewed by three members of the Execu=

 Enron VP.  I assume you are asking us to agree to deviate from this proces=

Subject:	Re: WEEKLY BUSINESS ACTIVITY UPDATES

For Portland General Electric, week of April 23, 2001
1)Announcement of termination of Enron and Sierra Pacific deal was uneventful,
and not surprising to employees and Portland Community.
2)Time was spent in addressing questions from data room in San Francisco.
3)FERC ordered the Cal ISO to file by 6/1/01, a RTO proposal with FERC. At the
same time FERC's approval of the effort by the 9 NW utilities (IOUs plus BPA)
to form RTO West was conditioned on making a 12/1/01 compliance filing that
addresses seams issues with California and Canada, and a timetable for
creating a West-wide RTO. Together, these orders should help prevent
California's efforts to balkanize their power system.
4)FERC's order on RTO West gave a boost to the inclusion within the RTO of the
independent-for-profit transmission company (TransConnect) proposed by 6 of
the 9 RTO utilities including PGE. Relying heavily on TransConnect's
independence, the Commission approved TransConnect's proposal to file for
innovative and incentive rates.
5)Wholesale sales continue strong in a robust market.
6)Thermal plants are in sequential annual  maintenance outages.
7)Hydro plants operations are reduced due to poor water condition in NW.
8)Contract negotiations continue with IBEW Local 125. Next meeting is
scheduled for May 7.
9)Customer Information System installation is approaching 75% completion,
being on schedule, and under budget.
10)Joint Meter Reading project is on target with 850,000 routes now merged
with NW Natural Gas.
11)SB 1149, Oregon's version of deregulation, is still uncertain in the
legislature. We are ready to implement on whatever timeframe is decided.
12)We plan to submit another fast track small microturbine generating plant
for RAROC next week.
13)Senator Gordon Smith reception held to keep contact on issues around price
caps, and there determental effect on energy markets and new generation.    

>>> Horton, Stanley 04/23/01 02:57PM >>>
I would appreciate if each of you could provide a brief (one-page or less)
bullet point summary of the week's activity by close of business each Friday. 
You can send either via e-mail or fax.

Jeff has his staff meetings on Monday mornings and it would help me keep him
abreast of key activities in your respective areas.

I don't need anything elaborate.

Thanks,
Stan

Subject:	MTBE legislation

Today, Senators Bob Smith (R-NH) and Harry Reid (D-NV) will introduce an MTBE bill. which is expected to be slightly different than we've seen in previous Congresses.  

We expect it to include:  

1) a 4-year date certain to eliminate MTBE, with EPA determining the phaseout schedule
2)  a lifting of the 2% oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by State governors within 90 days from date of enactment
3)  and environmental "anti-backsliding" provision focused only on air-toxics and using a 2000 baseline with a 27.5% percent standard (the way I understand it right now, RFG must perform 27.5% better than 2000 baseline for conventional gasoline)
4) provisions for MTBE producer "transition assistance"

Brief analysis:  

We'll have more details shortly, but the bill looks a little better than previous efforts.  A number of bills have been introduced this Congress, but this will probably be the leading effort.  

As you know, Enron has led efforts to include the "transition assistance" piece -- which is still largely undefined in the legislation -- but we are pleased with the inclusion of a "placeholder" while the Senate decides on the best approach.  We will continue to lead the development of such incentives (which will likely take the form of EPA/DOE funding for MTBE producers who convert plants to produce iso-octane or alkylate).

An MTBE ban is of course not good, but a "date certain" gives producers more flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under several steps of a phase out.   Allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy standard is probably a given in any legislation, but will face some opposition from the ethanol community -- who just want a simple MTBE ban.

The anti-backsliding provision is still being refined, but looks fairly lame.  We need more details to make an accurate assessment, but its likely that environmental groups will want a bit more.

One political factor -- with Sen. Jim Jeffords leaving the Republican party, Democrats will be given control of the Senate Environment Committee, which will consider this bill.  They will likely allow Jeffords to chair the committee.  The significance is that Sen. Bob Smith (R-NH) is the current chair, and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on MTBE -- in losing the chairmanship, his legislation may face a longer road through Committee.

I will keep you posted as the legislation evolves.

Thanks for forwarding Peter's resume.  By copy of this memo I am forwarding Peter's resume to Danny McCarty and Phil Lowry.  Danny and Phil: Please follow-up with Vince if you have an interest in meeting with Peter.  He seems to be a very qualified candidate.

Subject:	Follow-up on SIAM Workshop

I am forwarding for your attention the resume of Peter Percell
who has an extensive experience in modeling physical flows 
of natural gas in pipeline systems. Peter is looking currently for a job.

I met him last week at the meeting of the Science and Industry Advance with Mathematics
society at the University of Houston.

The application of recent developments in optimization theory
and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further 
efficiency of our pipeline system and reduce the consumption of compressor fuel.

Please, let me know if you interested in introducing Peter to executives
in your organization. I shall be glad to make arrangements for an interview.

I enjoyed your presentation, and meeting you briefly afterwards, at the
SIAM Workshop last Friday.

I have extensive experience as a technical leader in the design and
development of modeling and simulation software products, mostly
for the oil and gas pipeline industry.

I am looking for a position that can utilize my software development and
mathematical skills.  Getting out of the narrow confines of the pipeline
simulation industry would be a plus.

Please consider whether I might fit in your group.  Your answer to a
question indicated that I have several of the skills you look for.

Also, please let me know, by email, the names and contact information of
other managers within Enron who might benefit from having someone with
my qualifications in their group.

Attached are my resume and an addendum covering academic & consulting
experience.  Publications are available on request.

I will call you in a couple of days to follow up on this email.

Thank you for your time.

Stan. I am a glutton for punishment with now pursuing my MBA. But it is energizing (pardon, the pun) and very enjoyable. In light of this, I am to interview a leader about certain aspects of leadership, i.e. does leadership develop with experience, have there been one or two instrumental experiences that were signficant in developing your own leadeship style?

As my leader, would you have about 30 minutes or so, sometime this week, to discuss your ideas about leadership with me? To maximize your time, I would be glad to provide all questions in advance so I don't waste any time.

Please let me know and I hope you can visit with me.

Debbie has to be downtown for other reason on May 24th.  Could you meet with her about 4:15pm at my office.  I will schedule a conference room for your meeting with Debbie.  Perhaps yopu could come around 3:45pm and I could go over any and all changes that I have on tem prior to your meeting with Debbie.

Hello, Steve!   Thanks for the alert!    I did just call the Pro Shop one more time and spoke with a young lady by the name of Ashley, and she confirms that you guys are slated to tee off on Sunday at 8:15AM on the Old Course off #1.

Hit  'em straight!

Thank you Cindy!   I check with Raveneaux this morning as I was already
there.  The Pro Shop said there was no tee time for Horton.   I am sure they
just over looked it.  Just in case however,  I reserved a 9:45 am on the New
Course as a backup.  You may want to double check with the Pro Shop.  Thank
you again.  Please meeting you via e-mail.

Best regards.
Steve Westlund
