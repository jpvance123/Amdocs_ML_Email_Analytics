I skimmed the attached NOPR looking for the approach FERC was proposing to =
take to the key issue we fought over here in CA a couple of years ago.  Alt=
hough I did not see the word "congestion", the implication of what I read i=
s that the generator would pay for his extension cord plus any congestion i=
mpacts that it makes on the grid.  The implication of the last statement is=
 that the generator would put the grid back into the condition it was in "b=
ut for" the new generator.  That is great, assuming I did not skim from too=
 high an altitude.  Did I?

I also read the thing from the point of view of an issue that I had forgott=
en about until recently.  That is, if the generator pays for all of this up=
grade and "but for" stuff, and then "gives" it to the utility, are there ta=
xes due on the "gift"?  When we developed our project in Pittsburg, CA, PG&=
E's initial position was that we owed them for the upgrades AND for the tax=
es on the upgrades (about 35 - 40% additional charge), which they turned ov=
er to the state and fed.  (This is potentially A LOT of money to "waste" on=
 an interconnect, if it is an expensive one.)  Working with Enron's tax dep=
t (I do not remember specifically with whom), we convinced PG&E that taxes =
were probably not due for various reasons, and we mutually agreed to get a =
private letter ruling from the IRS confirming.  (We also agreed that IF the=
 taxes were ever due, that we would pay them.)  I understand that that IRS =
ruling was put in abeyance, pending some sort of law congress was consideri=
ng.  (I may be making this up here as I go along because Calpine bought the=
 project from us and I lost track of the various machinations.)  The point =
of all of this.  Is it reasonable in this NOPR process on interconnection t=
o address the tax issue?  Is it too late?  Is it irrelevant to the FERC pro=
cess?  Does anyone know the status of the law making process? =20

I am concerned about taxes for two reasons.  First, many of the opponents t=
o the proposed NOPR approach thought that all grid upgrades should be paid =
for by the utility and  included in rate base.  (In other words, "all gener=
ators are good and benefit the ratepayers.")  On fundamental grounds they w=
ill resist paying for upgrades.  If they believe that they will get the ins=
ult after injury treatment (pay for upgrades AND for taxes on the upgrades)=
, they will resist the NOPR more strenously.  (FYI to everyone, Calpine str=
ongly resisted paying for upgrades at Pittsburg and somehow got out of it. =
 And guess what?  Now with all of the new plants - ~1200MW added by Calpine=
 within a 5 mile area of 2500 MW of existing - there are congestion problem=
s around all of the projects, just as we forecasted.  ISO is now considerin=
g adding a new zone and/or charging PG&E and/or the projects for congestion=
.  Because PG&E did not, and probably never will in our lifetime, add the g=
rid upgrades so as to include in ratebase, the projects will be hurt.  Beca=
use all of this is not forecastable in the context of developing a project =
in a timely manner, this outcome, exactly as we had forecasted, is why we s=
upported the approach in the proposed NOPR.)  Second, perhaps naively, I am=
 assuming that the tax issue is no different for gas pipeline upgrades than=
 for electric transmission system upgrades.  On a project we are now develo=
ping in Roseville, CA, we are faced with significant gas pipeline system up=
grades in PG&E's system.  Significant grossups for tax impacts of the "gift=
" are are being discussed as I remember for Pittsburg's electric transmissi=
on system upgrades.  Since it sounds like the same issue, sure would be nic=
e if we could get some appropriate precedence going.  Any possibliity of de=
aling with the tax issues in this NOPR?

Jim --

The quick answer to your question on the Barton bill is that, yes, it does =
appear to address this tax issue involving interconnections, at least in pa=
rt.  There is language in Title VIII on various tax issues.  One of them ex=
ludes from gross income certain amounts received by electric utilities, spe=
cifically including connection fees.  In the example in the e-mail, the iss=
ue was not fees paid directly, but assets paid for by the generator that ar=
e then transferred to the utility.  Will check on that angle.

In any event, Title VIII (while in the Barton bill) is not in the jurisdict=
ion of Barton's subcommittee.  Instead, the tax title would have to go thro=
ugh the Ways and Means Committee.  There were some energy tax provisions in=
 the House-passed energy bill last August.  Chris and I will consult tomorr=
ow to see if this issue was included in that bill.

Aside from the tax issue, Barton bill would require the type of interconnec=
tion rulemaking that FERC is now conducting (both for connections to local =
distribution and to transmission).  In each case, the cost of interconnecti=
on would have to be comparable to what the utility charges others similarly=
 situated.  I will go back to double check, but off the top of my head I re=
call that the Bingaman draft specifically "socializes" the costs of interco=
nnection.

Thanks Dave,

The Nov. 1 meeting will be focused more on establishing the procedure that =
FERC will follow to tackle the interconnection issues other than costs (suc=
h as timelines, basic procedures).  ERCOT will present its agreement and pr=
ocedures and EPSA will present a list of problems that members have had.  E=
nron worked closely with other EPSA members over the past several years on =
problems that we have encountered in the interconnection procedures and IAs=
.  EEI will also make a presentation.  (Additionally, as you are probably a=
ware, over the past several years we have discussed problems with FERC hotl=
ine and have also had FERC staff call us to inquire about general interconn=
ection issues -- this ANOPR is meant to address many of those issues.)

At the end of the Nov. 1 meeting, other meeting participants will have a br=
ief amount of time to raise issues.  Donna Fulton will attend for Enron.  F=
ERC then plans to convene a series of meetings to establish generic interco=
nnection procedures and parts of an IA (results due to FERC Dec 14).  We wi=
ll then also submit Enron comments on the ERCOT IA and procedures by Dec. 2=
1. =20

FERC IS NOT addressing the cost issues during this stage of the proceedings=
; therefore, it will most likely not be dealing with the tax gross-up and c=
rediting issues yet.  It plans to deal with cost issues in a subsequent rul=
emaking.  (We certainly understand that cost issues are typically the most =
problematic part of interconnection negotiations, but this is the way FERC =
wants to proceed.  FERC will continue to deal with cost issues in orders wh=
en disputed IAs are filed at FERC unexecuted.)

By way of background on ERCOT, as I understand it, ERCOT basically rolls in=
 the interconnection costs (network-type upgrades) to the entire grid throu=
gh TCOS (an uplift).  However, TCOS are not allowed to be unlimited -- ERCO=
T has the ability to decide whether the generator interconnection is in the=
 best interest of the grid.  Some attribute all the new generation in ERCOT=
 to this method.  We will need to formulate Enron's view in the next phase =
of the interconnection proceeding.

For Thurs. meeting, I think Donna should raise these issues:
-- While certain basic aspects of the IA should be standardized to eliminat=
e the waste of time we usually face dealing with the same problems over and=
 over, the IA should be flexible enough to allow for individual business ci=
rcumstances (for example, the notice to proceed that we have been including=
.)

-- While having timelines and procedures are fine, the larger problem has b=
een getting utilities to actually follow their own filed procedures (for ex=
ample, Entergy was one of the first to file procedures, yet seems to have a=
 problem sticking to their timelines.)  This yet again means that RTOs are =
critical to stop the discriminatory practices and to provide incentives to =
treat us as customers.

--There needs to be more discussion on best practice No.2 below -- Energy r=
esource or capacity resource.  This should be reviewed in the context of FE=
RC's NOPR on icap (Enron just submitted comments that "capacity" as a separ=
ate payment is not necessary in functioning markets.  In addition, "capacit=
y" is not a separately required "payment" in most parts of the US outside o=
f current ISOs (ERCOT does not have icap)).

Attached is the ANOPR, ERCOT IA and procedures.  Susan Lindberg will be cir=
culating a draft of Enron comments on the agreement and procedures.  Includ=
ed on p. 11 of the ANOPR are "best practices" which include:

1. Comparable treatment for IPPs (allowed to be competing network resources=
 for load without having to be designated as a "network" resouce)
2. Multiple interconnection products:  Energy resource and capacity resourc=
e
3. Small generator exemption
4. Queueing with reasonable milestones (10 days to correct deficiencies)
5. Deposits (with deposits over actual cost refunded)
6. Siting: TPs would post optimal and non-optimal sites for locating genera=
tors (this is something that we had asked some new ITCs to provide.  Most T=
Ps have been reluctant to provide this service.)
7. Timelines (very similar to currently approved timelines)

Please provide any thoughts/comments to Susan Lindberg, Donna Fulton, Sarah=
 Novosel and me.  Thanks.  Christi 37007 =20

Last week's meetings in FERC's Generator Interconnection Procedures proceeding focused primarily on queuing issues.  A summary of the meetings is attached; the summary describes the meetings in some detail and lists interests articulated by the various parties.  

At the conclusion of the meetings:

 	- The generators and the transmission owners were still fairly far apart on several important issues pertaining to queuing:

		* what should be included in the base case study
		* milestones and their impacts
		* consequences of project cancellation
		* use of a preliminary feasibility ("fatal flaw") study
		* generator liability for upgrades

	- A committee of various participants issued a draft document on interconnection products and studies.  This document is attached.  The document recommends that three different types of interconnection service be available:  1) Energy Resource service, which allows use of existing capacity on an "as available" basis, 2) Network Resource service, which integrates the generator's facility as a qualified network resource in a manner comparable to native load customers, and 3) optional interconnection services, which would include but not be limited to Simple Interconnection Service, which allows physical interconnection but does not provide generator with the ability to synchronize its facility with the transmission owner's system.  Interested parties are to post comments on this document to the Commission's website by Nov. 23, and further issues pertaining to products will be discussed at the next meetings (Nov. 27 - 28).

If you have questions, or if you would like to discuss the attached, please contact me.

Last week FERC held a kickoff meeting on its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANOPR) for interconnection procedures. FERC staff proposes to have 6 weeks of meetings (up to 3 days per week) to discuss issues identified by the participants.   The purpose of the meetings is to try to develop consensus among industry participants on a standard interconnection agreement and procedures.  A list of issues is attached. This list was developed by EPSA and presented to FERC at last week's meeting.

At this week's meeting, the discussion will focus on the scope of interconnection rights and on interconnection study issues.  Donna Fulton will attend these meetings on behalf of Enron.  In preparation for the meetings, EPSA developed a position paper, which is attached.  Briefly, EPSA proposes:
 
    - Interconnecting Generator may elect, as part of its application for interconnection and study agreement, to be studied as an Energy Resource and/or as a Network/Capacity Resource; it may also request an "optional deliverability" study based on case-specific requirements.  The interconnecting generator may elect its level of interconnection following completion of the studies.
 
    - The rights of the interconnected generator will depend on the manner it is studied, the upgrades for which the generator has paid, and whether the transmission pricing system is based on physical rights or financial rights.
 
If you have any comments on the attached, please let me know as soon as possible.

Dickstein Shapiro Morin & Oshinsky has prepared the attached position
paper in connection with tomorrow's FERC conference on the scope of
interconnection studies and services.  It attempts to reflect what we
believe was the consensus position reached during today's and earlier
conference calls regarding the types of interconnection studies/products.

Also included are several additional points covered in the EPSA issues paper relating to both the scope of studies and the rights of
interconnecting parties.  Finally, included is a proposal for an additional interconnection service product sent to us late this afternoon by
Tenaska.  We look forward to your reactions either by email this evening, or
at the initial caucus meeting at 9 a.m tomorrow.  If there are concerns,
will we make adjustments at the caucus.  Thanks.

Subject: Position Paper on Generator Interconnection

Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=3D"=3D_7D27A2FC.D9B8D3BD"

Dickstein Shapiro Morin & Oshinsky has prepared the attached position
paper in connection with tomorrow's FERC conference on the scope of
interconnection studies and services.  It attempts to reflect what we
believe was the consensus position reached during today's and earlier
conference calls regarding the types of interconnection studies/products.

Also included are several additional points covered in the EPSA issues pape=
r relating to both the scope of studies and the rights of
interconnecting parties.  Finally, included is a proposal for an additional=
 interconnection service product sent to us late this afternoon by
Tenaska.  We look forward to your reactions either by email this evening, o=
r
at the initial caucus meeting at 9 a.m tomorrow.  If there are concerns,
will we make adjustments at the caucus.  Thanks.
