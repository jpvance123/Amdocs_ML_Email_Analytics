A preview of next season's MNF call:


--------------------
AL MICHAELS: Hello and welcome to another edition of ABC's Monday Night
Football, tonight broadcasting from beautiful Fed Ex Field in
Washington,
D.C. I'm Al Michaels, and joining me in the booth are two new members of
the ABC family, Dennis Miller and Dan Fouts.

DENNIS MILLER: Wow, Monday Night Football. I don't want to appear
nervous,
but I'm under more strain right now than Linda Tripp's capri pants. I
have
to tell you, I'm conflicted about this. I usually like to be the
outsider,
the rabble-rouser, the iconoclast, but I also like a nice seat at a
sporting
event.
And this seat is as nice as they get - except I think I took one of
Boomer's
old squeak toys up the *** when I sat down.
DAN FOUTS: I was a quarterback.
MILLER: Thanks for that insight, Mr. Peabody. Dan Fouts, everyone. I'm
looking over here, and he's giving me that same blank stare I see when I
put
my dog on the phone. Hey, this isn't the Senior Tour, Chi Chi. Try to
keep
up.
MICHAELS: Tonight the New England Patriots will try to get started on
the
right foot after a disappointing 8-8 showing last season. They take on
the
Washington Redskins, whose owner, Daniel Snyder, has paid out $65
million
in
free agent salaries and bonus payments in the offseason and is looking
for
results.
MILLER: Snyder is throwing around cash like a screech monkey playing
with
a
pop-up Kleenex dispenser. But he's a real hard-*** - it must be great to
coach this team. Norv Turner comes to work every day, hands his balls to
Gus, the 80-year-old equipment guy, who puts them in a footlocker behind
the
Stairmaster until the end of the game. Did you catch that one ***
-chewing
Turner received last season? Lee Harvey Oswald got off easier in that
little
room at the Dallas P.D. And when Turner finally got out of there you
could
tell he was looking around, desperately praying for Jack Ruby to show up
and
end his ****ing misery.
MICHAELS: The teams are on the field, and we're almost set for the
kickoff.
FOUTS: I was the quarterback. I didn't go on the field for the kickoff.
MILLER: Jesus, Shaggy, saunter on back to the Mystery Machine and take a
breather, OK? Why don't you pick up your brain off that pile of papers
it's
holding down and see what happens when you plug it in? The game's
starting,
and I feel like Corporal Agarn trying to explain supply and demand to
the
****ing Hakowis.
MICHAELS: As always, the Fuji Blimp makes its annual appearance at
Monday
Night Football. Glad to have you back, gentlemen.
MILLER: It is balloooooooooon! (high-pitched cackle).
MICHAELS: Starting at quarterback for the Redskins will be Jeff George,
whom
I guess one could call a journeyman at this point in his career.
MILLER: I have to admit, when I saw George on the roster I thought he
had
as
much chance of making the team as Linda Hunt on the set of Baywatch.
This
guy's been around - he's called a lot of plays under a lot of centers.
He's seen more giant asses than a guest chair on the Jerry Springer
Show.
MICHAELS: Snyder spent plenty in the offseason to sign star players such
as
Deion Sanders and Darrell Green on defense.
MILLER: Yeah, but look at that Fantasia broom army of social misfits the
Redskins call an offensive line. I have a feeling that George's
appearance
tonight is going to be shorter than Mini-Me stooping over to pick up one
of
Dr. Evil's monocles.
MICHAELS: George drops back to pass, moves out of the pocket and finds
the
veteran Michael Westbrook, who is tackled after an 11-yard gain.
MILLER: Look, I'm new, I don't know that much about defensive schemes.
But
it seems to me right there that the middle was as vacant as an interview
with Posh Spice.
FOUTS: I was in a Miller beer commercial, and your last name is Miller.
MILLER: Hey, Aristotle, save some of the probing insight for the rest of
us,
OK? How come I'm getting the funny feeling that this is an episode of
The
Munsters, and I'm Marian, the normal one? Now, I don't want to get off
on
a
rant here, but the useful comments coming from your side of the booth
could
be counted on the one hand of a bad wood shop teacher. I can still see
the
jelly on your forehead where the electroshock terminals were attached.
When
I took this job, they didn't tell me that I would be teamed with Pepe
the
Human Hamster on one side, and on the other a broken-down ex-quarterback
who
makes Jethro Bodine look like David Niven. I want to find the psychotic
network programmers who thought up this train wreck and point out that
this
**** has to be harder to watch than a sausage being made.
FOUTS: I like sausage.
MILLER: Ah **** it, where's my propeller hat?
MICHAELS: The handoff is to Stephen Davis, who is tackled at the 39-yard
line by defensive tackle Henry Thomas. But there's a flag on the play.
MILLER: I'd have to say that was the poorest result since O.J. took the
lie-detector test. And look at that ref, will ya? He's got more nervous
tics
than a Belfast valet.
MICHAELS: That play will be brought back, making it first and 20 from
the
49-yard line.
MILLER: Hey, who took my Raisinettes? Damn you, Roone Arledge! Damn you
to
hell!
MICHAELS: George back to pass ... and the throw to Westbrook falls
incomplete. Ty Law covering on the play.
MILLER: I don't want to be a downer here, but how about throwin' the
freakin' ball to the other side of the field, you know, cha-cha? You've
got
Westbrook drawing a bigger crowd than Anna Kournikova at the
maximum-security lockdown at Rikers, while meanwhile the kid on the
other
side is lonelier than a hooker at a Star Trek convention.
MICHAELS: To be fair, there have only been four plays so far.
MILLER: Come on Al, you missing link. That receiver is being shunned
like an Amish kid with a nipple ring. The left side of the field is to
George as a shower is to the French. You've got a better shot at hearing
Charlie
Sheen give the keynote address at a Promise Keepers rally than you do of
ever -
MICHAELS: Sorry to break in on you, Dennis, but Washington is guilty of
a
false start, and that will set them back another five yards.
MILLER: The ref is whipping out that flag like it's the only lighter at
a
crack house.
Later that evening:
MICHAELS: So your final score is Washington 17, New England 10. We're
headed
off to San Francisco for our next Monday night broadcast, hope to see
you
there.
MILLER: I may be late; I don't fly. It'll be me in my Chevy Nova playing
Mad
Max with the Madden Cruiser all the way down Route 66, and you'll know
I'm
winning when Pavorotti starts hurling six-legged turkeys out the
skylight
for ballast.
MICHAELS: What will you be doing with your remaining time in Washington,
D.C.?
FOUTS: Doing a little sightseeing.
MILLER: I'll be back at the hotel, masturbating like a red-assed monkey
watching the Banana Channel.
MICHAELS: So from all of us here at Monday Night Football, see you next
week...

Subject: Losers Wanted




Wow, what a response we have had so far...23  players are in (old news, more 
than that now).? WE NEED MORE  HOWEVER!!!!? Don't forget to spread the word 
if anyone you know would be  interested.? I surely expect atleast 10 more to 
join but would love alot  more.? Anyway, now to the important stuff...getting 
on the  site.
?
Unlike in years past, I feel that people are more  internet literate and can 
get signed up in a league without step by step  instructions.? So I am going 
to give you the basics and you can figure it  out from there.? I advise you 
do it sooner than later incase you have any  problems.
?
The site is www.commissioner.com.? On the home  page, you will see the?a 
place to sign into commissioner.? You must  have an account with 
commission.com to join the league.? It is the same  site we used last year 
and your name and password should still be active.?  If you don't remember 
it, you can create a new one or there is probably  somewhere that you can get 
them to email you your?username and  password.? Anyway, once you set up an 
account scroll down and select Office  Pool Manager. Our league name is 
Losers Wanted.? We also have a short name  of Loser (they might ask for that 
also, **notice no 's').? The password is  3333.
?
You should be taken to a page to pick who you  are.? Your name should not be 
in the list.? Select "new player" and  enter your name.? This should take you 
to the site.
?
Once you are in....BOOKMARK IT.? It will make  it alot easier to get to it in 
the future.? Take a look at the site.?  The three main links you will be 
using are...1)Make Picks...2)My  Picks...3)Standings.? Each week (I think 
Tuesday) commissioner.com will  enter the lines on the Make Picks page.? 
These lines will stay constant  untill they close the entries for the week (1 
hour before first kick?off,  includes Thursday games).? You can make your 
picks and change your picks on  this page.? To view your picks you can go to 
My Picks.? On Monday you  can check the Standings.? You can view it by a 
certain week or the yearly  totals.? Just click on the top on what column you 
will want to sort  by.? That is basically it.?There are other links if you 
want to check  them out...it is a great site.
?
As for the rules...the money will all be determined  as I get an exact number 
of players...ALL MONEY WILL BE PAID OUT!!!!! There will  be weekly winners 
and yearly winners (and LOSER).? The picks you make each  week will be each 
game that week, including Monday nights game.? In  addition to Monday's game, 
you will pick the Monday night total points  scored.? This tie breaker will 
determine weekly winners in case of any  ties.? The person closest to the 
total will win the tie breaker (absolute  value).? If the absolute value is 
equal, the under will beat the  over.? Example...total points is 30.? Player 
A picks 35...B picks  20...A wins.? Player A pick 35...B picks 25...B wins.? 
Don't worry, it  is real easy.? 
?
As for the tie breaker for the season totals.?  Anyone that is tied at the 
top will use the playoffs in the NFL as our  playoffs.? I will send out the 
lines (the site won't have them) to the  players involved.? You will pick all 
four games and the person who gets the  most correct will win.? If multiple 
people tie then we will weed out and go  on to the next weeks.? If it makes 
it all the way to the superbowl, then we  will pick the game and an 
over/under as the ultimate tiebreaker.
?
Don't worry if you don't make your picks one  week.? You won't take a zero?( 
I am a softie).? Too many people  have those weeks that they can't get around 
to making there picks.? If I  gave zeros, that would kill your chances for 
the yearly total.? Anyone that  doesn't get their picks in will take all the 
AWAY teams.? I will enter  those picks after the deadline to enter picks.? 
All these games will count  to the yearly total but can not win the weekly 
prize.? 
?
That is it for now...Oh ya, one more thing.?  You can send me a check ($50) 
to the following.? 
?
Michael Brookner
3001 Hillcroft #508
Houston, TX 77057
?
?
PLEASE DON'T FORWARD THIS TO NEW  PLAYERS.??I WANT TO KNOW EVERYONE THAT IS 
IN.? IF YOU KNOW  SOMEONE THAT IS INTERESTED, HAVE THEM EMAIL ME AT 
BROOK@PDQ.NET.? I WILL SEND ALL THIS INFO  TO THEM WHEN I GET THERE INTEREST.
?
?
THANKS....Brook

LSU Is Ranked Party School Champ
Distinction Disappoints University  Officials
BATON ROUGE, La., Updated 9:13 p.m. CDT August 16, 2000 --It's a  distinction
officials at Louisiana State University wanted to avoid, but now  the word is
out: LSU has been ranked the No. 1 party school in the Princeton  Review of
the nation's top colleges.
Despite seminars on alcohol abuse and  new policies for fraternities and
sororities regarding alcohol consumption,  LSU edged out the University of
Alabama for the top spot. The University of  Texas "won" third place.
Chancellor Mark Emmert said LSU is no more a party  school than any other
university.
The Princeton ranking was disheartening  news to university officials still
shaken after the Aug. 19, 1997, death of  an LSU student who drank
excessively during a celebration of his acceptance  into a fraternity.
Brigham Young University was dubbed the top "Stone Cold  Sober" school in the
review.

The top 20 "Party Schools," according to the Princeton Review:
1.  Louisiana State University
2. University of Alabama
3. University of  Texas
4. Florida State University
5. University of Colorado
6.  University of Tennessee
7. University of California at Santa Cruz
8.  Tulane University
9. University of Wisconsin
10. Ohio University,  Athens
11. University of New Hampshire
12. University of Michigan
13.  University of Vermont
14. Ohio State University
15. New York  University
16. Lehigh University
17. Southern Methodist University
18.  University of Florida
19. University of California at Santa Barbara
20.  Union College
The top 20 "Stone Cold Sober Schools," according to the Princeton  Review:
1. Brigham Young University
2. Wheaton College
3. California  Institute of Technology
4. U.S. Naval Academy
5. U.S. Coast Guard  Academy
6. Samford University
7. Cooper Union
8. Wellesley  College
9. Mount Holyoke College
10. Calvin College
11. Haverford  College
12. Golden Gate University
13. U.S. Air Force Academy
14.  College of the Ozarks
15. Grove City College
16. Wells College
17.  Simmons College
18. Illinois Institute of Technology
19. Colorado School  of Mines
20. Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology

ADVICE TO INTERNATIONAL PASSENGER ON LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
Passengers on a journey involving an ultimate destination or a stop in a
country other than the country of origin are advised that the provisions of
a treaty known as the Warsaw Convention may be applicable to the entire
journey, including any portion entirely within the country of origin or
destination.  For such passengers on a journey to, from, or with an agreed
stopping place in the United States of America, the Convention and special
contracts of carriage embodied in applicable tariffs provide that the
liability of certain carriers, parties to such special contracts, for death
of or personal injury to passengers is limited in most cases to proven
damages not to exceed U.S. $75,000 per passenger, and that this liability up
to such limit shall not depend on negligence on the part of the carrier.
The limit of liability of U.S. $75,000 above is inclusive of legal fees and
costs except that in case of a claim brought in a state where provision is
made for separate award of legal fees and costs, the limit shall be the sum
of U.S. $58,000 exclusive of legal fees and costs.  For such passengers
traveling by a carrier not a party to such special contracts or on a journey
not to, from, or having an agreed stopping place in the United States of
America, liability of the carrier for death or personal injury to passengers
is limited in most cases to approximately U.S. $10,000 or U.S. $20,000.
The names of carriers, parties to such special contracts, are available at
all ticket offices of such carriers and may be examined on request.
Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance from a
private company.  Such insurance is not affected by any limitation of the
carrier's liability under the Warsaw Convention or such special contracts of
carriage.  For further information please consult your airline or insurance
company representative.

NOTICE OF BAGGAGE LIABILITY
Liability for loss, delay, or damage to baggage is limited unless a higher
value is declared in advance and additional chares are paid.  For most
international travel (including domestic portions of international journeys)
the liability limit is approximately $9.07 per pound for checked baggage and
$400 per passenger for unchecked baggage.  For travel wholly between U.S.
points federal rules require any limit on an airline's baggage liability to
be at least $1250 per passenger.  Excess valuation may be declared on
certain types of articles.  Some carriers assume no liability for fragile,
valuable or perishable articles.  Further information may be obtained from
the carrier.

CARRIER RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REFUSE CARRIAGE TO ANY PERSON WHO HAS ACQUIRED
A TICKET IN VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE LAW OR CARRIER''S TARIFFS, RULES OR
REGULATIONS
SUBJECT TO TARIFF REGULATIONS

NOTICE OF INCORPORATED TERMS
Effective January 1, 1983, this notice forms part of the conditions of
contract between the airline and the passenger.  If there is any
inconsistency between the incorporated terms described below and the terms
and conditions in the passenger's ticket, these incorporated terms govern.
 Air transportation to be provided between points in the U.S.
(including its overseas territories and possessions) is subject to the
individual terms of the transporting air carriers, which are herein
incorporated by reference and made part of the contract of carriage.
Foreign air transportation is governed by applicable tariffs on file with
the U.S. and other governments. Incorporated terms may include, but are not
restricted to:
1. Limits on liability for personal injury or death.
2. Limits on liability for baggage, including fragile or perishable goods,
and availability of excess valuation coverage.
3. Claims restrictions, including time periods in which passengers must file
a claim or bring an action against the air carrier.
4. Rights of the air carrier to change terms of the contract.
5. Rules on reconfirmation of reservations, check-in times, and refusal to
carry.
6. Rights of the air carrier and limits on liability for delay or failure to
perform service, including schedule changes, substitution of alternate air
carriers or aircraft and rerouting.
You can obtain additional information on items 1 and 6 above at any U.S.
location where the transporting air carrier's tickets are sold.
 You have the right to inspect the full text of each transporting air
carrier's terms at its airport and city ticket offices.  You also have the
right, upon request, to receive free of charge the full text of the
applicable terms incorporated by reference from each of the transporting air
carriers.  Information on ordering the full text of each air carrier's terms
is available at any U.S. location where the air carrier's tickets are sold.

NOTICE-OVERBOOKING OF FLIGHTS
 Airline flights may be overbooked, and there is a slight chance that
a seat will not be available on a flight for which a person has a confirmed
reservation.  If the flight is overbooked, no one will be denied a seat
until airline personnel first ask for volunteers willing to give up their
reservation in exchange for a payment of the airline's choosing.  If there
are not enough volunteers the airline will deny boarding to other persons in
accordance with its particular boarding priority.  With few exceptions
persons denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation.  The
complete rules for the payment of compensation and each airline's boarding
priorities are available at all airport ticket counters and boarding
locations.  Some airlines do not apply these consumer protections to travel
from some foreign countries, although other consumer protections may be
available.  Check with the airline or your travel agent.

RECONFIRMATION NOTICE
Some international carriers require reconfirmation of your reservations.
Contact the transporting air carrier for the applicable requirements.

NOTICE
If the passenger's journey involves an ultimate destination or stop in a
country other than the country of departure the Warsaw Convention may be
applicable and the Convention governs and in most cases limits the liability
of carriers for death or personal injury and in respect of loss of or damage
to baggage.  Se also notices headed "Advice to International Passengers on
Limitation of Liability" and "Notice of Baggage Liability Limitations"

for the benefit of agents, servants and representatives of carrier and any
person whose aircraft is used by carrier for carriage and its agents,
servants and representatives.

Big Unit's fastball kills  dove
During the seventh inning of the Diamondbacks'  split-squad 10-6 victory 
against the Giants on Saturday, Randy Johnson hit  and killed a dove flying 
in front of home plate with a fastball. Johnson's  pitch to the Giants' 
Calvin Murray was about three-fourths of the way to home  plate when it 
struck the bird. Giants second baseman Jeff Kent picked  up the dead bird 
with his bare hands and jokingly pointed toward Johnson  before taking it to 
the dugout. Johnson was not amused by the incident. "I  didn't think it was 
all that funny," he said. On Aug. 4, 1983, Yankees  outfielder Dave Winfield 
killed a seagull in Toronto with a warmup throw. The  Ontario police charged 
him with animal cruelty, although the charge was later  dropped.

Sweet, I'm a millionaire! Ha. Not much in B.R.  I go to N.O. every weekend
because it is still boring until football cranks up.  I'm leaving for Europe
for six weeks and I have to get my addresses in order.  Thanks for replying,
hope all is well with you and keep in touch.

hey annie!   good to hear from you.  how is everything going?  do you have a 
valentine?  i have one.  it is a girl i have been seen for a few months.  you 
are so lucky you get to go skiing.  i wish i could hit the slopes.  i haven't 
skiied in over a year.  you do need a rich guy to support you in san fran.  
it is so expensive there.  you could just go anna nicole and get some guy who 
is almost dead and inherit all his cash.  you're not that type of girl though 
which is good.  who else lives up there.  i thought erin and her sister lived 
there also.  i can't remember.  keep in touch and stay warm there.

A blind guy on a bar stool shouts to the bartender, "Hey! Wanna hear a
blonde joke?" The bar immediately becomes absolutely quiet. In a hushed voice,
the guy next to him says, "Before you tell that joke, you should know
something."
"The bartender is blond, the bouncer is blond, and I'm a 6' tall, 200 pound
blond with a black belt in karate.  What's more, the guy sitting next to me
is 6'2," weighs 225 pounds, and he's a blond weight lifter." He continues,
"The fella to your right is blond, 6'5" and pushing 300 pounds, and he's a
wrestler. Think about it seriously, Mister. You still wanna tell that
joke?"  The blind guy says, "Nah! Not if I'm gonna have to explain it five
times.

Elizabeth-

Do you still send confirms to counterparties for physical deals done day to 
day?  AEP has a problem with one of the confirms on a deal done Jan. 31.  
They sold us two packages of 5000 at PGE Citygate for 12.30 and 12.40.  I 
entered this as one deal for 10000 at 12.35.  They need the confirm to match 
their records for each deal.  If you could send another confirm I would 
appreciate it.  Thanks for your help.

A preview of next season's MNF call:


--------------------
AL MICHAELS: Hello and welcome to another edition of ABC's Monday Night
Football, tonight broadcasting from beautiful Fed Ex Field in
Washington,
D.C. I'm Al Michaels, and joining me in the booth are two new members of
the ABC family, Dennis Miller and Dan Fouts.

DENNIS MILLER: Wow, Monday Night Football. I don't want to appear
nervous,
but I'm under more strain right now than Linda Tripp's capri pants. I
have
to tell you, I'm conflicted about this. I usually like to be the
outsider,
the rabble-rouser, the iconoclast, but I also like a nice seat at a
sporting
event.
And this seat is as nice as they get - except I think I took one of
Boomer's
old squeak toys up the *** when I sat down.
DAN FOUTS: I was a quarterback.
MILLER: Thanks for that insight, Mr. Peabody. Dan Fouts, everyone. I'm
looking over here, and he's giving me that same blank stare I see when I
put
my dog on the phone. Hey, this isn't the Senior Tour, Chi Chi. Try to
keep
up.
MICHAELS: Tonight the New England Patriots will try to get started on
the
right foot after a disappointing 8-8 showing last season. They take on
the
Washington Redskins, whose owner, Daniel Snyder, has paid out $65
million
in
free agent salaries and bonus payments in the offseason and is looking
for
results.
MILLER: Snyder is throwing around cash like a screech monkey playing
with
a
pop-up Kleenex dispenser. But he's a real hard-*** - it must be great to
coach this team. Norv Turner comes to work every day, hands his balls to
Gus, the 80-year-old equipment guy, who puts them in a footlocker behind
the
Stairmaster until the end of the game. Did you catch that one ***
-chewing
Turner received last season? Lee Harvey Oswald got off easier in that
little
room at the Dallas P.D. And when Turner finally got out of there you
could
tell he was looking around, desperately praying for Jack Ruby to show up
and
end his ****ing misery.
MICHAELS: The teams are on the field, and we're almost set for the
kickoff.
FOUTS: I was the quarterback. I didn't go on the field for the kickoff.
MILLER: Jesus, Shaggy, saunter on back to the Mystery Machine and take a
breather, OK? Why don't you pick up your brain off that pile of papers
it's
holding down and see what happens when you plug it in? The game's
starting,
and I feel like Corporal Agarn trying to explain supply and demand to
the
****ing Hakowis.
MICHAELS: As always, the Fuji Blimp makes its annual appearance at
Monday
Night Football. Glad to have you back, gentlemen.
MILLER: It is balloooooooooon! (high-pitched cackle).
MICHAELS: Starting at quarterback for the Redskins will be Jeff George,
whom
I guess one could call a journeyman at this point in his career.
MILLER: I have to admit, when I saw George on the roster I thought he
had
as
much chance of making the team as Linda Hunt on the set of Baywatch.
This
guy's been around - he's called a lot of plays under a lot of centers.
He's seen more giant asses than a guest chair on the Jerry Springer
Show.
MICHAELS: Snyder spent plenty in the offseason to sign star players such
as
Deion Sanders and Darrell Green on defense.
MILLER: Yeah, but look at that Fantasia broom army of social misfits the
Redskins call an offensive line. I have a feeling that George's
appearance
tonight is going to be shorter than Mini-Me stooping over to pick up one
of
Dr. Evil's monocles.
MICHAELS: George drops back to pass, moves out of the pocket and finds
the
veteran Michael Westbrook, who is tackled after an 11-yard gain.
MILLER: Look, I'm new, I don't know that much about defensive schemes.
But
it seems to me right there that the middle was as vacant as an interview
with Posh Spice.
FOUTS: I was in a Miller beer commercial, and your last name is Miller.
MILLER: Hey, Aristotle, save some of the probing insight for the rest of
us,
OK? How come I'm getting the funny feeling that this is an episode of
The
Munsters, and I'm Marian, the normal one? Now, I don't want to get off
on
a
rant here, but the useful comments coming from your side of the booth
could
be counted on the one hand of a bad wood shop teacher. I can still see
the
jelly on your forehead where the electroshock terminals were attached.
When
I took this job, they didn't tell me that I would be teamed with Pepe
the
Human Hamster on one side, and on the other a broken-down ex-quarterback
who
makes Jethro Bodine look like David Niven. I want to find the psychotic
network programmers who thought up this train wreck and point out that
this
**** has to be harder to watch than a sausage being made.
FOUTS: I like sausage.
MILLER: Ah **** it, where's my propeller hat?
MICHAELS: The handoff is to Stephen Davis, who is tackled at the 39-yard
line by defensive tackle Henry Thomas. But there's a flag on the play.
MILLER: I'd have to say that was the poorest result since O.J. took the
lie-detector test. And look at that ref, will ya? He's got more nervous
tics
than a Belfast valet.
MICHAELS: That play will be brought back, making it first and 20 from
the
49-yard line.
MILLER: Hey, who took my Raisinettes? Damn you, Roone Arledge! Damn you
to
hell!
MICHAELS: George back to pass ... and the throw to Westbrook falls
incomplete. Ty Law covering on the play.
MILLER: I don't want to be a downer here, but how about throwin' the
freakin' ball to the other side of the field, you know, cha-cha? You've
got
Westbrook drawing a bigger crowd than Anna Kournikova at the
maximum-security lockdown at Rikers, while meanwhile the kid on the
other
side is lonelier than a hooker at a Star Trek convention.
MICHAELS: To be fair, there have only been four plays so far.
MILLER: Come on Al, you missing link. That receiver is being shunned
like an Amish kid with a nipple ring. The left side of the field is to
George as a shower is to the French. You've got a better shot at hearing
Charlie
Sheen give the keynote address at a Promise Keepers rally than you do of
ever -
MICHAELS: Sorry to break in on you, Dennis, but Washington is guilty of
a
false start, and that will set them back another five yards.
MILLER: The ref is whipping out that flag like it's the only lighter at
a
crack house.
Later that evening:
MICHAELS: So your final score is Washington 17, New England 10. We're
headed
off to San Francisco for our next Monday night broadcast, hope to see
you
there.
MILLER: I may be late; I don't fly. It'll be me in my Chevy Nova playing
Mad
Max with the Madden Cruiser all the way down Route 66, and you'll know
I'm
winning when Pavorotti starts hurling six-legged turkeys out the
skylight
for ballast.
MICHAELS: What will you be doing with your remaining time in Washington,
D.C.?
FOUTS: Doing a little sightseeing.
MILLER: I'll be back at the hotel, masturbating like a red-assed monkey
watching the Banana Channel.
MICHAELS: So from all of us here at Monday Night Football, see you next
week...

Hey, man, I just forward the things.
I don't write 'em.

They pay me to wave the flag along the highway, not screw with email.
By the way, shouldn't you guys be passing gas or power or whatever it is you
guys pass?

I'm not sure I ever sent you this, but its from my honeymoon...

Matt,  

Please take a look at these spreadsheets and calc the gas usage by plant and 
by pipe in CA.  Chris Foster is telling us that most of these palnts will be 
shutting down in the next few weeks due to credit exposure.  Let's discuss 
the impact on sendouts.

Thanks,
Grigsby

Ice!


THE PRE-BOOTY CALL AGREEMENT
>>> > This pre-booty call agreement (hereinafter referred to as the
>>>"Agreement")
>>> > is
>>> > entered into on the _____ day of __________, 2000, by
>>> > _______________________, between ____________ and ______________.
>>>THIS AGREEMENT SHALL COVER THE FOLLOWING RULES AND PRINCIPLES:
>>>1. No sleeping over -- unless it is very good and we need to repeat
>>> it in the morning.
>>>
>>>2. No meeting in public except for dinner or drinks before the
>>> events of the evening.
>>>
>>>3. No calls before 9 PM -- we don't have shit to talk about.
>>>
>>>4. None of that "lovemaking" shit -- only mind-blowing sex allowed.
>>>
>>>5. No emotional discussions -- Ex.: Where are we heading with this?
>>> Do you love me? The answer is no, so don't ask.
>>>
>>>6. No plans made in advance -- that is why you are called the
>>> "backup," unless you are from out-of-town, then it's only a one-
>>>time advanced arrangement.
>>>
>>>7. All gifts excepted -- money is always good.
>>>
>>>8. No baby talk -- however, dirty talk is encouraged.
>>>
>>>9. No asking for comparisons with former lovers -- it's really none
>>> of your damn business.
>>>
>>>10. No calling each other "friends with privileges" -- we are not
>>> friends, just sex buddies.
>>>
>>>11. Calling out the wrong name during sex is OK -- don't be
>>> offended.
>>>
>>>12. No extra clothing -- I don't want your ass leaving anything
>>> behind when you leave.
>>>
>>>13. No falling asleep right after sex -- it's over, so get your ass
>>> up and go home.
>>>
>>>14. Don't be offended if I don't ask if you enjoyed it -- I don't
>>> care.
>>>
>>>15. You cannot borrow my car for any reason.
>>>
>>>16. If anyone asks who you are, the standard response will be: "My
>>> roommate's girlfriend/boyfriend."
>>>
>>>17. Doggie style preferred -- just hit it hard and right or get the
>>> hell out!
>>>
>>>18. Reason for doggie style: the less eye contact the better. I
>>> don't want to look at you, just fuck you.
>>>
>>>19. We hook up absolutely whenever the mood strikes ME -- so don't
>>> keep calling.
>>>
>>>20. The most important one -- no condoms, no fucking. Carry your ass
>>> home.
>>>
>>>21. Bring your own drink -- I am not your liquor store.
>>>
>>>22. No phone use, please -- don't want anyone calling back looking
>>> for your ass.
>>>
>>>
>>> *** EXTRA TIP FOR SUCCESSFUL BOOTY CALLS***
>>>
>>> The aforementioned rules may only be altered by the holder of
>>> the agreement. If the other party attempts to change or alter any
>>> terms of this Agreement, it will automatically become null
>>> and void and you will then be removed from the BOOTY CALL LIST and
>>> deleted from phone memory and email list. BLOCKED from all
>>> communications until your silly ass understands the rules.

Hey guys,

Just wanted to let you know that Kori Loibl has offered up her apartment as a 
Pre-party spot.  The financial desk will be there as well as Purvi & her 
boyfriend and  Mo "the bomb" Sanchez and her fianc,e John.  Don't know if you 
guys have any interest, but the offer's open.  Either way, we'll have to find 
someplace extend the festivities after the X-mas party shuts down...(the 
Black Swan, Eu-grope-a, etc).

Susan

Subject: Amen, brother


At their annual meeting before the beginning of the football season,
the top southern football programs decided to have Golden phones
installed in each of their respective offices. One day a recruit named
Marcus walked into Jackie Sherrill's Miss. State office and saw his
Golden phone sitting there. "Wow," Marcus exclaimed, "What's that?"
 Jackie responded, "Well son, that's my Golden Phone; it's a direct
line to Heaven. "Wow, that's pretty neat," Marcus responded. "Do
you think I could make a call on that phone?"  "Well yes, but it's
going to cost you about $100. You can make the check out to the
Mississippi State University Football Foundation," replied Jackie.
"That's a lot of money. I don't think I should spend that much.
Thanks anyway," Marcus replied as he left the office.

A few weeks later Marcus took a visit at the campus of Texas
A&M University and went into Coach R. C. Slocum 's office where
again he saw a Golden phone.  "What exactly is that phone for?"
asked Marcus.  Coach Slocum replied, "That's my direct line to
Heaven."   "Do you think I could make a call from that phone?"
asked Marcus.  "Well sure, but it's going to cost you about $200,
and you can make the check out to the Texas A&M University
Foundation." replied Slocum.   "Oh never mind, I don't have that
kind of money. Thanks though."  Marcus shook his head and left
Coach Slocum's office.

The next weekend, Marcus took his official visit to Louisiana State
University campus and made the office of Coach Saban his first stop.
Upon arriving, the first thing Marcus noticed was the Golden phone
on Coach Saban's desk.  Marcus asked if that was a direct line to
Heaven.  When Coach Saban replied that it was, Marcus again asked
if he could make a call using the phone.  "Well sure you can, but it
will cost you 35 cents," replied Saban.  Upon hearing this, Marcus'
eyes got real big and he said, "Really?  Then why did Coach
Sherrill and Coach Slocum tell me it would cost so much more?"
Coach Saban looked up from behind his desk and smiled, saying,
"Because, son, here at LSU, it's a local call."

L S U --- GO TIGERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Due to the high number of attacks on women in secluded parking lots the
city of Melbourne, Australia opened the world's first all female parking lot.
Even the attendants and security staff working the lot are all female in
a further effort to create a comfortable and safe atmosphere.
Attached is a picture of this one and only parking lot.

i cannot go to denver the last week of may b/c i have to be here for work.  
the last week is when we set gas prices for the next month.  i think the best 
thing for me to do is come to phoenix one weekend.  i have been golfing 
lately.  i got a lesson and the teacher gave me a new swing.  i am kind of 
struggling with it now.  i think it will take me to the next level.  i will 
try to call you and grandma this weekend.

If you yelled for 8 years, 7 months and 6 days, you would
have produced enough sound energy to heat one cup of coffee.
(Hardly seems worth it)

If you fart consistently for 6 years and 9 months, enough
gas is produced to create the energy of an atomic bomb.
(Now that's more like it)

A pig's orgasm lasts for 30 minutes. (In my next life I want
to be a pig) (How'd they figure this out, and why?)

Banging your head against a wall uses 150 calories an hour.
(Still can't get over that pig thing)
(Don't try this at home...maybe at work?)

Humans and dolphins are the only species that have sex for
pleasure.  (Is that why Flipper was always smiling?)
(And pigs get 30-minute orgasms? Doesn't seem fair)

The strongest muscle in the body is the tongue.
(Hmmmmmmmmm........)

Right-handed people live, on average, nine years longer than
left-handed people do.
(If you're ambidextrous do you split the difference?)

The ant can lift 50 times its own weight, can pull 30 times
its own weight and always falls over on its right side when
intoxicated.
(From drinking little bottles of...?)
(Did taxpayers pay for this research??)

Polar bears are left handed.
(Who knew....? Who cares? How'd they find out, did they
ask them?)

The catfish has over 27,000 taste buds.
(What can be so tasty on the bottom of the pond?)

The flea can jump 350 times its body length. It's like a
human jumping the length of a football field.
(30 minutes...can you imagine?? And why pigs?)

A cockroach will live nine days without it's head, before
it starves to death.
(Creepy)

The male praying mantis cannot copulate while its head is
attached to its body. The female initiates sex by ripping
the male's head off.
(Honey, I'm home. What the....)
(Well, at least pigs get a break there...)

Some lions mate over 50 times a day.
(In my next life I still want to be a pig ... quality over
quantity)

Butterflies taste with their feet.
(Oh, Geez)  (That's almost as bad as catfish)

An ostrich's eye is bigger than it's brain.
(I know some people like that.)

Starfish don't have brains.
(I know some people like that too.)

After reading all these, all I can say is.............
Lucky Pigs...

Dear Phillip Allen and Matthew Lenhart:

As you know, I am Matthew Lenhart's PRC representative. As such, I would
like to meet with each of you (separately or together) to discuss the year
end PRC process, and Matthew Lenhart's activities during the second half of
the year. It is extremely important that we meet prior to year end so that
I can make sure I can adequately represent  your interests in the PRC.
Therefore, at your convenience, please contact my assistant, Shelby
Malkemes (x3-9842) to set up a time for us to get together. My guess is
that 45 minutes is probably sufficient, and we can arrange a follow up if
needed.

If you need to contact me directly before our meeting, I can be reached at
x3-6173.

Regards,

Ben

Ice!


THE PRE-BOOTY CALL AGREEMENT
>>> > This pre-booty call agreement (hereinafter referred to as the
>>>"Agreement")
>>> > is
>>> > entered into on the _____ day of __________, 2000, by
>>> > _______________________, between ____________ and ______________.
>>>THIS AGREEMENT SHALL COVER THE FOLLOWING RULES AND PRINCIPLES:
>>>1. No sleeping over -- unless it is very good and we need to repeat
>>> it in the morning.
>>>
>>>2. No meeting in public except for dinner or drinks before the
>>> events of the evening.
>>>
>>>3. No calls before 9 PM -- we don't have shit to talk about.
>>>
>>>4. None of that "lovemaking" shit -- only mind-blowing sex allowed.
>>>
>>>5. No emotional discussions -- Ex.: Where are we heading with this?
>>> Do you love me? The answer is no, so don't ask.
>>>
>>>6. No plans made in advance -- that is why you are called the
>>> "backup," unless you are from out-of-town, then it's only a one-
>>>time advanced arrangement.
>>>
>>>7. All gifts excepted -- money is always good.
>>>
>>>8. No baby talk -- however, dirty talk is encouraged.
>>>
>>>9. No asking for comparisons with former lovers -- it's really none
>>> of your damn business.
>>>
>>>10. No calling each other "friends with privileges" -- we are not

>>>
>>>15. You cannot borrow my car for any reason.

>>>
>>>20. The most important one -- no condoms, no fucking. Carry your ass

this is pretty funny.  when you want to try sushi, give me a call.  i'll tell
you all the good stuff to get and we'll try some soy beans.  they are so good
for you and taste good too!  they're a great snack -- tons of protein, very
little fat and carbs.  you spelled it "discusting."

did you get martha and billie's car?  did you give them something extra for 
hooking you up?  go to the web site www.adcritic.com and look at the fox 
sport commercials for the basketball promo.  there is one for the jazz, 
spurs, lakers and knicks.  they are hillarious.

i lost your number in austin.  i tried to give you a call last night and 
clear up our argument  from saturday.  that got way out of hand and i 
apologize for that.  there is no reason for me to be such a hot head about 
that.  give me a call when you get a chance and we can clear up that mess.  
your parents got your stuff yesterday.  let me know what you want to do with 
that tv.  talk to you later.

Cooper-

The sheet that you sent me earlier doesn't refresh anymore.  It is  saying 
that a rollback transaction is missing.  Let me know if I need to do anything 
to fix it.  Thanks for your help.

I work on the West Gas Desk in Houston.  Cooper said that you might be able 
to help me with a link we have to one of your databases that is not working.  
This link pulls the scheduled California loads, generation, and imports.  
This link has not worked since this morning.  Please let me know if you could 
help.  

Thank you,

 We need your help. Please read the following:

   Unfortunately, it has become all to frequent that a man will father a
  child and then run off.  Often times without paying any child support.
  The girl in this picture will face many challenges because she has no
  father in her life.  If you know who her father might be, please contact
  the  police immediately.

>>>and
>>>sucked the cone" To which Little Johnny replied, "The correct answer is
>>>the

>>>Math Class

>>>Little Johnny returns from school and says he got an F in arithmetic.
>>>Why?"
>>>asks the father. The teacher asked 'How much is 2x3' I said "6" But
>>>that's

>>>asks the father. That's what I said!"

>>>Little Johnny, thinks for a bit, then says, "Yu're an eight, but if you

>>>One day, during lesson on proper grammar, the teacher asked for a show

I made a few changes from on the Socal forecast:

1.)  Put in the updated PV, NP, & SP power curves - now the generators are 
running at peak levels
2.) Increased Ehrenberg from 1.2 to 1.25
3.) Took off the weather adjustments when the new SP generation begins

The new forecast brings Socal storage to a max of 86 Bcf before Q3.  We can 
discuss this further on Monday.

Matt

Sara-

I am sending the resume of a friend of mine who I think is a good candidate 
for the associate program.  Please get back to me and let me know what else I 
need to do to get him in for an interview.  Thank you for your help.

So buddy...what is up? WI am just getting ready to leave work and head home to
Denver tomorrow morning for the week. My oldest bro had a baby last week and 
my
other bro got engaged and there is a huge party for them tomorrow. i am super
excited because it fall on the long weekend. I will be skiing in Steambost 
this
weekend . However Tahoe has been getting dumped on. I am too broke to even go
skiing out here....the gas bill is Killing me. (tee hee) Actually, we do not
even turn on our heat because our place is very hard to keep warm...the hard
wood floors and the tall ceilings. As for SF.. everything is great. i love it
but I need to get a better paying job because I am broke. Oh well, I need to 
do
it while I am young and fins some rich guy. (just kidding) Anyway, How are you
doing? Any ladies strikin your fancy this valentine's day?

so we are set to play golf at cypress lakes on sunday at 12:30.  we can meet 
up at 11:15 and get out there early to hit balls.  it is a pretty fun course 
to play and it has a lot of water on the front 9.  the back 9 is kind of 
dry.  should be fun.

I think we should dig up that slip that Matt Hersh gave to Max saying that
he might have been exposed to an STD and then get the photo of his cock in a
doughnut to complete the circle.  Has anyone fwded that mail to Coco?  I'm
sure she has a couple fond memories for the two of them to savor throughout
their marrige.

Here's an update on the Fall league. Once you have a list of people
(hotties) who want to play, sent it to me and I'll make sure our team is
stacked.

Pass this on the Brian Hull.

Subject: Fall Season begins Oct. 2nd!!


I hope everyone enjoyed themselves this past season!!
As for me, despite the mood I was in during our loss Tuesday, I did
actually have fun!  Sorry for being such a d---head!!

Anyway, on to more positive stuff.... I have decided to put myself through
this one more time (no Winter league for me!), but I need your help.
Please let me know the following...

     - if you are interested in playing full-time in the Tuesday night Fall
coed league that will begin Oct. 3rd
or
     - if you are only interested in being a sub

Remember, the cost of the team is fixed and each person's share is
determined by the number of people paying, so please only commit if you
will be coming out to play (and pay).

Please reply by next WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 27th.  I will not assume that you
want to play unless you send me a confirmation email.

Thanks,
Roy

		Broncos Topper
		 McGlockton defends himself
		
		
		brn0507csm
		McGlockton (J. Leyba)
		 Weighing in at 352 pounds, Chester McGlockton is the heaviest starting 
defensive lineman in Denver Broncos history. He also has become a mighty big 
target. 
		
		Last month, former San Diego Chargers director of player personnel Billy 
Devaney, working for ESPN as an NFL draft analyst, applauded each of the 
Broncos' offseason moves - except one. Devaney blasted the Broncos for 
signing McGlockton, whom he candidly accused of being a negative locker room 
influence. About which McGlockton shrugs.

		 The Denver Post's Broncos writer takes your questions each week and responds 
to the pick of the litter in "Adam Schefter's Broncos Mailbag," which is 
posted each Thursday. Check out this week's installment as Adam tackles 
questions ranging from the silly to the scintillating, including several 
about training camp.

		Jackson (AP)
		 He misses family members, friends, food and the fun. Yet these days, 
Barcelona Dragons quarterback Jarious Jackson - on loan from the Denver 
Broncos - misses out on nothing. 
		
		Jackson's Barcelona, Spain, hotel is positioned along a topless beach. He 
swims in Europe's history and traditions. He travels as if he were a college 
backpacker, visiting Berlin last month, Dusseldorf, Germany, last weekend, 
with plans that still include Amsterdam and Scotland.

Donnie -

Sounds good and you missed one hell of a weekend.  From what I hear,
everyone had an awesome time.  Celeste and I counted 12 weddings we got
invited to this year between the two of us and also sometime this summer,
Celeste and I are going to California to visit Alex and Kelly.  I'll let
everyone know about the invite, but it may be easier for you to let me know
next time you come in town.

Send me your phone numbers again when you get a chance -
Val

Florval,
How's married life?  I wanted to congratulate you and Celeste.  Again,
sorry
we were not able to make it down for the wedding.  I think it is safe to
assume that the wedding was a bit more fun than the First Communion we went
to that Saturday.  I hope there are some good stories.  I am guessing you
are back from the honeymoon at this point, and you guys had a great time.
Hopefully, you will hold off on populating the earth with any more
Florval's.  At least give everyone a few more years to begin preparations.
I hope we can somehow try to get together in the near future.  I may try to
get down there sometime late summer or fall.  Also, there is always an open
invitation at the Casa De Trahan here in DC (actually Northern VA - And to
think in my 1st 18 years, all I thought existed was the Westbank.  There is
so much more!  Thought you might get a kick out of that comment).  This
invitation is good if anyone is passing through or would like to visit our
nation's capitol (It's such a better place now that the 'White Trash' that
was living in the 'White House' has moved out).  I know it not as cool as
Melancon living 5 blocks from Wrigley, but you know?  The invite holds good
not only for Mr.& Mrs Louis Florval Generes (what the hell is that?), but
also any of the other bums down in Houston that I have not seen if a few
years.  Later Val.


Donnie

i have heard the rodeo opens at 6:45 for rodeo activities, but the concert 
won't start until about 8:30.  someone up here went to duran duran last night 
and it said the same thing on the schedule.  i will call tomorrow and double 
check, but i really don't think they would start a concert that late, def 
leppard isn't that old.

A blind guy on a bar stool shouts to the bartender, "Hey! Wanna hear a
blonde joke?" The bar immediately becomes absolutely quiet. In a hushed voice,
the guy next to him says, "Before you tell that joke, you should know
something."
"The bartender is blond, the bouncer is blond, and I'm a 6' tall, 200 pound
blond with a black belt in karate.  What's more, the guy sitting next to me
is 6'2," weighs 225 pounds, and he's a blond weight lifter." He continues,
"The fella to your right is blond, 6'5" and pushing 300 pounds, and he's a
wrestler. Think about it seriously, Mister. You still wanna tell that
joke?"  The blind guy says, "Nah! Not if I'm gonna have to explain it five
times.

 We need your help. Please read the following:

   Unfortunately, it has become all to frequent that a man will father a
  child and then run off.  Often times without paying any child support.
  The girl in this picture will face many challenges because she has no
  father in her life.  If you know who her father might be, please contact
  the  police immediately.

we need to pass on penalties to counterparties who cut us on gas day of may 
11.  many counterparties are swinging on eol deals, so  going foward we are 
going to rank those counterparties to take the cuts.  as far as this deal 
goes, the problems incurred were due to logistical issues.  we did rerank 
wild goose for cycle 4, but pg&e did not allow for renoms on this cycle.

 Matt

 I am passing on these penalties for non-performance Friday for the
firm volumes that did not flow.  The firm sales amount of which you did not
perform was  5000 mmbtu at $6.90.  Gas daily reported that the weekend
traded as low as $3.70.  Therefore, we are assessing liquidated damages in
the amount of US$16,000, the amount of which Lisa Feisst will invoice.  I
would like to ensure that this problem does not happen again. Wildgoose is
not the swing market, and all transactions completed on your screen are firm
as are all transactions, unless otherwise specified, with Wildgoose and
Alberta Energy Company.  We, at Alberta Energy Company consider this a
serious matter, not the dollar figure associated but the implications in the
California market place and are treating it as such.  Our companies have had
a longstanding relationship and we would like rectify this problem so we can
regain trading together in the future.  A letter outlining the above will be
sent to yourself  and John Lavorado for your records.

 Thanks

Coach Jim Haslett had put together the perfect
New Orleans Saints team.
The only thing he was missing was a good quarterback.

He had scouted all the colleges, and even the high schools,
but he couldn't find a ringer quarterback
who could ensure a Super Bowl win.

Then one night, while watching CNN,
he saw a war-zone scene in Bosnia.
In one corner of the screen,
he spotted a young Bosnian soldier with a truly
incredible arm.
He threw a hand grenade straight
into a 15th-story window 200 yards away
--ka-boom!

"I've got to get this guy!"  Haslett said to himself.
"He has the perfect arm!"
So, he brings the kid to the New Orleans
and teaches him the great game of football,
and the Saints go on to win the Super Bowl
for the first time in history.

The young Bosnian is "canonized"
as the Great Hero of football,
and when Haslett asks him what he wants,
all the young man wants to do
is to call his mother.
"Mom," he says into the phone,
"I just won the Super Bowl."
"I don't want to talk to you," the old woman says.
"You deserted us.  You are not my son."
"I don't think you understand, Mother!" the young man pleads.
"I just won the greatest sporting event in the world.
I'm here among thousands of my adoring fans."
"No, let me tell you," the mother retorts.
"At this very moment, there are gunshots all around us.
The neighborhood is a pile of rubble.
Your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives yesterday,
and today your sister was kidnapped in broad daylight."
The old lady pauses, and then tearfully says "
 ...I'll never forgive you for making us move to
New Orleans."

Allen-

I wanted to know if it was possible to get write access to the natural gas 
risk management site.  I would like to be able to link in excel reports under 
the west desk tab.  Please let me know if this is possible.  Jay Reitmeyer 
would also need access.  Thanks for your help.

Just a few side notes...1)? Applebaum, we are  going to have to work on that 
name you signed in with...2) Susan, I will send  you a seperate email in the 
next couple of days with some help on getting on  line.
?
Anyway, don't forget to get more players.? BUT  DON'T FORGET TO HAVE THEM 
REFERENCE YOU!!!? I am receiving emails from  people I can't reference and it 
just takes a little work to figure out who they  are.? We have got all of 
them cleared up except for one that I am still  working on.? It just makes it 
alot easier if they mention you from the  begining.
?
Well, that is it for now.? Will get back to  you towards the middle of next 
week with some more updates.
?
Brook

Matt, if you're strapped for cash I could maybe send you some, but I'm
really strapped right now.  Put a bathroom in my house and I'm trying to pay
that off along with other things that are hurting me financially.  Let me
know.  I figured you were a big shot down there, I thought $500 would be
pocket change to you?

Matt-

     We will be around Sunday & sunday night, so call then.. I won a night
at the Hotel Monaco downtown at a bridal show, so I didn't tell Max & I
upgraded it to a suite with hot tub & all, so we are staying there Sat. &
sat. nite, getting massages and I made reserv. at Panzano's for
dinner...that will be our Valentine's day, since we were both exhausted
last nite.  Hope he likes it...he bought "the ring"...so he has "get out of
jail card" for every holiday this year, i told him...:)
  What did you do to piss off your girlfriend at dinner? Nothing a few
flowers & back massage can't take care of,...
Take care-
jen

A very successful energy trader parked his brand-new Mercedes in
front of his
office, ready to show it off to his colleagues. As he
got out, a
truck passed too close and completely tore off the
door on the
driver's side. The trader immediately grabbed his cell
phone, dialed
911, and within minutes a policeman pulled up.

Before the officer had a chance to ask any questions,
the energy trading icon
started screaming hysterically. His Mercedes, which he
had just picked
up the day before, was now completely ruined and would
never be the
same, no matter what the body shop did to it.

When he finally wound down from his ranting
and raving, the
officer shook his head in disgust and disbelief. "I
can't believe how
materialistic you energy traders are," he said. "You are so
focused on your
possessions that you don't notice anything else."

"How can you say such a thing?" asked the trader.

The cop replied, "Don't you know that your left arm is
missing from
the elbow down? It must have been torn off when the
truck hit you."

"My God!" screamed the master trader. "Where's my Rolex?"

 Matt

 I am passing on these penalties for non-performance Friday for the
firm volumes that did not flow.  The firm sales amount of which you did not
perform was  5000 mmbtu at $6.90.  Gas daily reported that the weekend
traded as low as $3.70.  Therefore, we are assessing liquidated damages in
the amount of US$16,000, the amount of which Lisa Feisst will invoice.  I
would like to ensure that this problem does not happen again. Wildgoose is
not the swing market, and all transactions completed on your screen are firm
as are all transactions, unless otherwise specified, with Wildgoose and
Alberta Energy Company.  We, at Alberta Energy Company consider this a
serious matter, not the dollar figure associated but the implications in the
California market place and are treating it as such.  Our companies have had
a longstanding relationship and we would like rectify this problem so we can
regain trading together in the future.  A letter outlining the above will be
sent to yourself  and John Lavorado for your records.

 Thanks

 THE GOLFING NUN
A nun is sitting with her Mother Superior chatting.
"I used some horrible language this week and feel absolutely terrible
about it."
"When did you use this awful language?" asks the elder.
"Well, I was golfing and hit an incredible drive that looked like it was
going to go over 280 yards, but it struck a phone line that was hanging
over the fairway and fell straight down to the ground after going only
about 10 yards."

"Is that when you swore?"
"No, Mother," says the nun. "After that, a squirrel ran out of the
bushes and grabbed my ball in its mouth and began to run away."

"Is THAT when you swore?" asks the Mother Superior again.
"Well, no." says the nun. "You see, as the squirrel was running, an
eagle came down out of the sky, grabbed the squirrel in his talons and
began to fly away!"

"Is THAT when you swore?" asks the amazed elder nun.

"No, not yet. As the eagle carried the squirrel away in its claws, it
flew near the green and the squirrel dropped my ball."

"Did you swear THEN?" asked Mother Superior, becoming impatient.
"No, because the ball fell on a big rock, bounced over the sand trap,
rolled onto the green, and stopped about six inches from the hole."

The two nuns were silent for a moment. Then Mother Superior sighed ands
said, "You missed the fucking putt, didn't you?"

Matt,

Softball starts in 2 weeks on Oct. 3rd. I imagine they'll send out an email
with more info later in the week or possibly beginning of next week. It is a
co-ed non-competitive league, but there are some pretty good players out
there.

later,
Mitch

   "The Southeastern Conference is unequivocally the paragon of the college 
football conferences-"

CKL







SEC TRADITIONS
                                           A weekly column by Chris Warner

                                           Perspectives on SEC Football and 
Thoughts on
                                           the Impending Football Season



                                           I would like to kickoff this 
column with a few choice quotes from the
                                           annals of a most colorful, and 
telling, SEC gridiron history:

                                           "Southern football fans are 
knowledgeable, fair and loud. They are proud
                                           of their football heritage, their 
schools, and their teams. And they share a
                                           deep pride that goes with being 
from the south" --George Mooney, the
                                           irreplaceable "Voice of the 
Volunteers" in the 1950s

                                           "The true football fan pays no 
attention to time or mileage when there is a
                                           big game to see." --John Heisman, 
head coach, Auburn University

                                           "In Baton Rouge, the focal point 
of everything is Tiger football." --Jim
                                           Corbett

                                           "In Baton Rouge, it's not a law to 
love LSU, but the city fathers could
                                           probably get one passed if they 
needed to." --Charles McClendon, head
                                           coach, LSU

                                           "After so many years at a school, 
you become a member of the football
                                           family." --Bob Fulton

                                           "I don't care where a man comes 
from or how he spells his name. All I
                                           ask is that he be loyal to 
Georgia, proud of that jersey, and try like the
                                           devil to win." --Wally Butts, head 
coach, Georgia

                                           "Deep inside, we're still the boys 
of autumn, that magic time of the year
                                           that once swept us on to America's 
fields." --Archie Manning

                                           "Tradition is a rich asset for any 
team. Tradition and success are traveling
                                           companions." --Wallace Wade, head 
coach, University of Alabama

                                           The above quotes were excerpted 
from Criswell Freeman's "The
                                           Wisdom of Southern Football" 
(1995).


                                           As football season creeps ever 
closer, the avid enthusiast finds it difficult
                                           to contain the unbridled 
excitement and anticipation that bubbles like
                                           summertime sweat within their 
pigskin-thirsty souls. Football season is
                                           that special time of year that not 
only means the beginning of another
                                           healthy slate of competitive 
gridiron contests filled with spectacular plays
                                           and high drama--it's also the 
definitive rallying point for the onslaught of
                                           all the expected pomp, pageantry, 
and circumstance that goes
                                           hand-in-hand with the college 
game. In no conference in the country is
                                           this statement more true than the 
tradition-rich Southeastern Conference.
                                           The ongoing rivalries, the 
colorful histories and traditions, the premier
                                           tailgating, the coquettish 
southern bells in their gameday garb, the reunion
                                           of lasting friendships, and the 
competitive fire and spirit that accompany
                                           the game, all make the entire SEC 
football experience a very real, and
                                           visceral one--even to the most 
casual observer. 

                                           The Southeastern Conference is 
unequivocally the paragon of the college
                                           football conferences, and the 2000 
season figures not to disappoint the
                                           thousands of rabid fans that flock 
to the stadiums each week throughout
                                           the southeast; as well as the 
millions more who tune in from home on the
                                           tube to follow their respective 
teams. Quite frankly, SEC football has
                                           never been bigger, or better. The 
southern cultural phenomenon only
                                           continues to grow with each 
passing season. The number of fans, and the
                                           competition that they long for 
each and every weekend of the football
                                           season, has never been bigger or 
better. In 1999, the SEC again set
                                           attendance records for its games, 
and with the many recent expansions to
                                           existing stadiums in the 
conference, those records should again fall at the
                                           end of this season. 

                                           Five Reasons Tiger Fans Can Be 
Excited About the 2000 Football
                                           Season

                                           1. Lou Tepper is no longer in 
Tiger Town.

                                           Heralded by professional defensive 
coaches as a "guru" and a "defensive
                                           genius" prior to his arrival at 
LSU, the former Illinois head coach led the
                                           LSU defense to its worst two-year 
performance in the history of the
                                           school (1893). If you are 
interested in immortalizing the Tepper legacy at
                                           LSU for your scrapbook, copies of 
his book "Complete Linebacking"
                                           can still be obtained (at a 
discounted price no less) at most local book
                                           outlets. In Tepper's absence, 
maybe the Tigers will return to the days of
                                           coach Charlie Mac and the standout 
defensive units that were his
                                           trademark while at the Ole War 
Skule. Speaking of Coach Mac, I caught
                                           up with him last week at his home 
and he sounded as spry as a spring
                                           chicken. He told me that he is 
doing great and that he enjoys cycling in
                                           the mornings to stay in shape. 
Coach told me that he hopes that the LSU
                                           players have fun this year, 
because, he said, "...having fun is what it's all
                                           about. If you can't have any fun, 
you're in big trouble."

                                           2. Contrary to popular belief, the 
Tigers are deep at quarterback.

                                           Preseason prognosticators have 
cited the injury to Rohan Davey as a
                                           core reason why the Tigers will 
have trouble at the quarterback position.
                                           They all opined early that both 
Booty and Nall had difficulties leading the
                                           offense and that the injury to 
Davey was a major setback to the Tiger
                                           offense. However, reports from 
summer camp indicate that Rohan is now
                                           within 95-100 percent of his 
normal range of motion on his knee, and in
                                           light of this it would appear that 
the Tigers are again three-deep at the
                                           quarterback position. The 
resurgence of Rohan is a tremendous boost to
                                           the team. Known for his leadership 
ability both on and off the field,
                                           Rohan possesses the true grit that 
wins ball games. I caught up with
                                           former LSU All-American and coach 
Gaynell Tinsley at his Highland
                                           Road home a few weeks ago, and he 
told me that he thought that
                                           Rohan's performance against 
Arkansas was the best he had ever seen by
                                           an LSU quarterback. True frosh 
Marcus Randall impressed in the LA
                                           High School All-Star game last 
week, but he is a likely redshirt with the
                                           logjam of experienced competition 
ahead of him.

                                           3. Nick Saban.

                                           Derided unfairly early by most SEC 
media outlets as being "incompatible"
                                           with Louisianians' unique culture 
and high football expectations, Saban is
                                           easily the best thing to happen to 
LSU football since Kevin Faulk. A
                                           consummate professional, Saban 
exudes confidence and paints a clear
                                           vision for the future of the 
program. His presence in Red Stick has made
                                           an immediate impact on the 
program, evidenced by the recent glowing
                                           comments at media days by seniors 
Louis William and Fred Booker.
                                           Saban was also unfairly chastised 
heavily by the media for his inability to
                                           bring any assistants with him to 
LSU from his previous staff at Michigan
                                           State. However, Coach Saban 
recently aptly stated at the SEC media
                                           days that only a couple of his 
previous staff members had ever been
                                           "south of the Mason-Dixon line." 
That notwithstanding, you cannot argue
                                           with the fact that Saban has 
compiled a great staff of southern coaches.
                                           Tiger fans should find further 
solace in the fact that coach Saban has
                                           never had a losing record as a 
football coach.

                                           4. Trev Faulk & Bradie James at 
Linebacker.

                                           All good defenses have a common 
trait--great linebacking play, and you'll
                                           be hard-pressed to find two better 
young horses than these two. Outside
                                           linebacker and pass rushing 
specialist Jeremy Lawrence is another super
                                           sophomore to keep your eyes on. 
These guys all have good wheels, and
                                           will put the leather on you when 
they get the chance. James' number 11
                                           Faulk's recent acquisition of 
Mealey's lucky 7 will undoubtedly prompt
                                           many fans and commentators to make 
countless puns and jokes related
                                           to LSU's 7-11 linebacking duo.

                                           5. Predictions Don't Mean Diddly

                                           The other day I was scouring 
through the many rolls of microfilm in the
                                           basement of Middleton Library at 
LSU, and I stumbled upon this most
                                           interesting fact: 

                                           In August, 1958, LSU was picked to 
finish 8th out of 10 SEC teams.
                                           Auburn, which had won the national 
championship the year prior with
                                           Shug Jordan, was picked to repeat 
as conference champs, followed by
                                           Ole Miss and Mississippi State. 

                                           Of course, in spite of the dismal 
preseason ranking by the SEC
                                           sportswriters, the Bengal Tigers 
went on to record their only unblemished
                                           season and national college 
football championship to date. This story
                                           should only serve to encourage 
fans that are despondent over the
                                           outcome of the past two seasons in 
Tigertown. Anything can happen in
                                           the SEC, and remember, the old 
adage says that "history repeats itself."

                                           Keep the faith Tigerfans!

                                           Until next time...

what kind of books are you looking to read?  

the line was this: "those pants are making me hungry."  and unfortunately my 
witty come-back came the next morning when i remembered the dipshit telling 
me this. too little, too late! it would have been nice to embarrass him in 
front of his friends.  i hope i dont need to tell you not to use this.

Subject: Choices

Most of you know that I very rarely send fwds, but my Dad sent me the one 
below ;and although I've read it, I still think its worthwhile to read again.

Everyone have a good weekend.

CKL

READ THIS.  LET IT REALLY SINK IN.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > THEN CHOOSE HOW YOU START YOUR DAY TOMORROW.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > Michael is the kind of guy you love to hate. He is always in a good
>>  >> > mood and always has something positive to say:
>>  >> >
>>  >> > When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "if I
>>  >> > were any better, I would be twins!"
>>  >> >
>>  >> > He was a natural motivator.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > If an employee was having a bad day, Michael was there telling the
>>  >> > employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > Seeing this style really made me curious, so one day I went up to
>>  >> > Michael and asked him, "I don't get it! You can't be a positive
>>  >> > person all of the time. How do you do it?"
>>  >> >
>>  >> > Michael replied, "Each morning I wake up and say to myself, you
have
>>  >> > two choices today.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > You can choose to be in a good mood or you can choose to be in a
bad
>>  >> > mood.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > I choose to be in a good mood.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > Each time something bad happens, I can choose to be a victim or I

>>  >> >
>>  >> > I choose to learn from it.

>>  >> >
>>  >> > I choose the positive side of life.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > "Yeah, right, it's not that easy,"  I protested.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > "Yes, it is,"  Michael said.  "Life is all about choices. When you
>>  >> > cut away all the junk, every situation is a choice.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > You choose how you react to situations. You choose how people
affect
>>  >your
>>  >> > mood.  You choose to be in a good mood or bad mood.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > The bottom line:  It's your choice how you live life."
>>  >> >
>>  >> > I reflected on what Michael said. Soon thereafter, I left the
>>  >> > company to start my own business. We lost touch, but I often
>>  >> > thought about him when I made a choice about life instead of
>>  reacting to
>>  >> it.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > Several years later, I heard that Michael was involved in a serious
>>  >> > accident, falling some 60 feet from a communications tower.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > After 18 hours of surgery and weeks of intensive care, Michael was
>>  >> > released from the hospital with rods placed in his back.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > I saw Michael about six months after the accident.  When I asked
him
>>  >> > how he was, he replied. "If I were any better, I'd be twins. Wanna
>>  >> > see my scars?"
>>  >> >
>>  >> > I declined to see his wounds, but I did ask him what had gone
>>  >> > through his mind as the accident took place.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > "The first thing that went through my mind was the well-being of my
>>  >> > soon to be born daughter," Michael replied. "Then, as I lay on the
>>  >> > ground, I remembered that I had two choices: I could choose to live
>>  >> > or I could choose to die. I chose to live."
>>  >> >
>>  >> > "Weren't you scared? Did you lose consciousness?" I asked.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > Michael continued, "...the paramedics were great. They kept telling
>>  >> > me I  was going to be fine. But when they wheeled me into the ER
and
>>  I
>>  >> > saw the expressions on the faces of the doctors and nurses, I got

>>  >> >
>>  >> > "What did you do?" I asked.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > "Well there was a big burly nurse shouting questions at me," said
>>  >> > Michael.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > "She asked if I was allergic to anything. "Yes, I replied."
>>  >> >
>>  >> > The doctors and nurses stopped working as they waited for my reply.
>>  >> > I took a deep breath and yelled, "Gravity."
>>  >> >
>>  >> > Over their laughter, I told them, "I am choosing to live. Operate
on
>>  >> > me as if I am alive, not dead."
>>  >> >
>>  >> > Michael lived, thanks to the skill of his doctors, but also because
>>  >> > of his amazing attitude. I learned from him that every day we have
>>  >> > the choice to live fully.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > Attitude, after all, is everything.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > "Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry

>>  >> >
>>  >> > After all today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > You have two choices now:
>>  >> >
>>  >> > 1.  Delete this.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > 2.  Forward it to the people you care about.
>>  >> >
>>  >> > I hope you will choose #2.  I did.

Mr. Ponce-

I just wanted to get back with you on some of your customers.  Gas in 
California really came off and I just wanted to get the feeling of the 
industrials after the one day drop.  Give me a call when you get a chance @ 
(713)853-7176.

Due to the high number of attacks on women in secluded parking lots the
city of Melbourne, Australia opened the world's first all female parking lot.
Even the attendants and security staff working the lot are all female in
a further effort to create a comfortable and safe atmosphere.
Attached is a picture of this one and only parking lot.

i just came in early to catch up.  i was out half day friday and all day 
yesterday.  i am up for whatever, but i dont want to get totally trashed on 
thursday and not be able to go out friday or saturday.  

dc is such a great city.  i could definitely live there. my friend works for 
the Speaker of the House so saturday he took me to the capitol and i got to 
see the speakers office and his private balcony that overlooks the washington 
monument and a lot of other offices and rooms that are off-limits to the 
public.  the weather was unbelievable - during the day not a cloud in the 
sky, high of 70 and at night 50. it was awesome.  we went out in georgetown 
friday and saturday.  matt, you would totally love this place. there was 
about 4 bars outdoors right on the Potomac with Watergate in the background 
and this huge fountain.  we should all take a trip there for a weekend - or 
boston, thats the next place i want to go.  i need to move out of this city, 
but then i would miss all of y'all.  so.... anyway, what are we doing this 
weekend?

what are you doing at work so early?  i am already pumped to go out this 
weekend.  fri was bad for susan and eric.  they were the only one doing 
shots.  everyone else was fairly sober and just hanging out.  it was pretty 
discusting.  let's hit the town this weekend.  maybe even thurs.  how was 
dc?  i heard that place is a blast.

scheduled gen & load.  I want to pull the actual loads along with the 
scheduled.  Get back to me when you get a chance.

Cooper- 

I wanted to know if you could send down the foward curves for SP, NP & PV.  I 
also wanted to know if I can access these curves daily here in Houston.  Get 
back to me when you get a chance.  Thanks for your help.

We've never used the CEMS data, so I don't know anything about its level of 
accuracy. As far as use of the WSCC data goes, I noticed that you've got 
table entries and are showing '0' values for a  lot of plants that have never 
reported reliably, such as Hermiston, Gadsby, Priest Rapids, Wanapum, etc.-- 
I'd leave those out until we see some plausible data reported. Also, we don't 
use data from plants where better numbers are available from other sources, 
e.g. most Pacific Northwest federal hydro.

Also, are you doing anything to filter out bad hours? There are intermittent 
periods where series of zeros or series of identical readings are erroneously 
reported due to telemetry failures. If you're computing totals or averages 
from the WSCC data that are consistently smaller than known, accurate 
reports, then this might be the cause.

Enclosed is a copy of the generation reports we put together using your 
generation database.  Please look them over and make sure that they are in 
the correct order an make sense.  Some of the monthly averages in the report 
do not match the CEMS database number.  I wanted to know if I should fill in 
the historicals with the CEMS numbers or keep these.  If you could just look 
these over and let me know if they make sense I would appriciate it.

if anyone is up for getting some drinks at woody's tonight i am in.  i am 
going to test my new theory out tonight: hot school teachers don't have 
anything to do in the summer so they go out to try to meet guys with careers 
that can support them.  it is actually just a hypothesis at this point, but 
sierra on wednes. has added support.  let me know if you are in. and remember 
it is the in the name of science.

Hey guys and gals, just a reminder that we  are?less than a week away from 
kickoff and I see that you have not joined  in the office pool.? By now you 
should have received the directions on how  to join the pool.? There is still 
plenty of time but I still advise not to  wait to long just incase you have 
any problems.
?
We are at over 40 players as long as each of you  join up.? Let me know if 
you have changed your mind so I can take you off  my list (at least for this 
year).
?
Hope all is going well and I'll look for you on the  page.
?
Brook

Mr. Skilling-

Here are a few questions I would like to submit before your floor meeting on 
the 32nd floor  Wednesday.

1.)  Enron seems to be taking a new approach to their business by taking 
assets off the books and looking for new opportunities as a market maker in 
new markets.  Is Enron going to be just a trading company?

2.)  If Enron is just a trading company our earnings could be quite 
volatile.  How could this affect our stock price?  Will Wall Street be 
prepared to accept more volatile earnings?

3.)  Volume on EOL seems to be decreasing since the middle of the year and 
new platforms are being introduced into the market place.  Is this going to 
have a negative effect on Enron's stock price?

4.) What are some of the new markets Enron plans to explore in the near 
future?

5.)  Is Broadband coming along as quickly as Wall St. expects and how much of 
our stock price is based on broadband?

I hope these questions are in line with some of the issues you wish to 
discuss and I look foward to hearing you speak tomorrow.

Sincerely,

Matt Lenhart

Enclosed is a copy of the generation reports we put together using your 
generation database.  Please look them over and make sure that they are in 
the correct order an make sense.  Some of the monthly averages in the report 
do not match the CEMS database number.  I wanted to know if I should fill in 
the historicals with the CEMS numbers or keep these.  If you could just look 
these over and let me know if they make sense I would appriciate it.
