There has been a change in the PRC Representative for your group.  Andy 
Zipper is now your PRC Rep, his extension is:  3-6994.  Please see the 
spreadsheet below.  Thanks.

PRC Representatives
Thank you for your participation in the year-end 2000 PRC.  Listed below are 
the Associates/Analysts you will be representing:



As you may know, the final PRC will be conducted on December 12th (Analysts) 
and December 13th (Associates).  Your participation in these meetings is 
essential.  Prior to that date, each business unit has been asked to conduct 
a pre-rating meeting to determine each employee's pre-rating.  The 
pre-ratings will be loaded into the PEP system.  The PEP system is open and 
available for employees to select reviewers.  You have been listed as a 
secondary supervisor so that you may review each of your Associates/Analysts 
feedback.  You are responsible for contacting the Supervisor and/or 
Associates/Analysts to discuss and obtain valuable performance information.  
The Associate and Analyst Programs will also provide you with a copy of the 
completed feedback for each of the people you represent once the PEP system 
is closed.  The more information that you can secure regarding your 
Associates/Analysts will ensure that each person is cross-calibrated 
correctly at the final PRC.  If you are a new PRC Representative and are 
unsure of the process, please contact either Jana Giovannini at x3-9233 or 
Shelly Butler at x3-4584 with any questions.

Supervisors
You should approve/add/delete the reviewers selected by the 
Associates/Analysts that work in your group.  You should then consolidate 
this feedback including your over-all thoughts, which should be presented at 
your business unit pre-rating meeting.  If your business unit is not 
conducting a pre-rating meeting due to it's size, please make sure that the 
rating you provide is loaded into the PEP system prior to the final PRC.  
Please contact the PEP help desk at x3-4777 option 4 or Terry Bosien at 
x3-5230 if you are unable to load this data yourself.  You should wait to 
provide feedback to your Associates/Analysts until the final decisions have 
been made to avoid any confusion.  All pre-ratings are subject to the final 
cross-calibration and may change in the final PRC meeting.  You are 
responsible for contacting the PRC Representative listed above whom will be 
representing your Associates/Analysts prior to the final PRC.  Keep in mind 
that the more information you can provide, either verbal or written, will 
ensure that the final PRC is a success.

Associates/Analysts
You are responsible for selecting your reviewers.  You should have received 
your logon ID and password from the PEP team.  If you have not received this, 
please contact x3-4777 option 4 with questions.  Please go into the system 
and select your reviewers.  Your direct supervisor may let you know how many 
people to select and will be ultimately responsible for approving your 
reviewers.  Remember that it is important to select a broad range of 
reviewers that include internal/external customers at any level.  You will 
also be asked to complete feedback on yourself.  Be sure to take the 
opportunity to detail your accomplishments and specific ways in which you 
have added value to your unit.  This is your chance to be heard.  You may 
hear from your PRC Rep to discuss your roles and responsibilities.  If you do 
not, we suggest that you contact them either verbally or in writing.  

An Enfo-session regarding the PRC is being held at 3:30pm on November 1, 2000 
at the Doubletree Hotel, La Salle Ballroom A for all Associates and 
Analysts.  We encourage you to attend.  Final PRC results should be 
communicated to the Supervisor by 12/31/00.  The feedback should be 
communicated to the Associates/Analysts by 1/15/01.  If the 
Associates/Analysts have not received feedback by the deadline, they should 
contact their Career Development Manager (Jana Giovannini x3-9233 or Shelly 
Butler x3-4584).  Thank you for your cooperation and we look forward to a 
successful final PRC

Amy:
If I could take the class beginning on November 18th, that would be great.
I think it would really help me get some problems I've been having worked

Mike:
My Dad has the tickets and is going to keep them with him.  He doesn't want
them to get lost in the mail.  We are staying in Cincinatti and are driving
over Sat and Monday for the games.  The best thing to do is meet at a
certain gate # or the "will call window".  I will call your Dad next week
and set things up on a meeting place before the game.  Leave me your Dad's
home number so I can call him next week.  These guys are going to have a
great time that weekend.  Talk to you soon.

Michael:
How's your summer?  Are you in Delaware now?  I am going to set up a
weekend in DC in the Fall and I will probably do it around homecoming
weekend.  I want to try and set it up for most of the people will huge out
with, but will take other suggestions.  I will be sending out e-mails to
everyone informing them of the weekend.  Choby is going to set up a bar to
rent out for Saturday night.  In the past, you have sent me e-mails with a
bunch of different e-mail addresses attached to it.  If you could send me a
list of the e-mails you have for our friends that would be great.  Thanks
for the help and lets talk about this further.  Talk to you soon.

As many of you know already, I am back in the academic lifestyle at University
of MD's, Smith Business School.  I will still have my PwC email address and
voicemail.  I will check these about once a week.  An easier way to get a hold
of me will be by my new email address of cchoby2002@rhsmith.umd.edu or on my
cell phone at 202-321-4857.  And yes, I still have the digital camera so look
out for some stories and pictures from my new adventure.

Friends and colleagues,

Today, Friday March 10, is my final day at Enron.

It has been said, =01&Friends are the thermometer by which we may judge the=
=20
temperature of our fortunes.=018  And so it is, that on my last day at Enro=
n, I=20
count myself among the most fortunate.  My sincere thanks to you who have=
=20
given me so much over the past three years and touched my life in so many=
=20
ways.  I have found Enron to be a special place, full of remarkable=20
individuals, and will always have fond memories of my time here.

On Monday, I am going to Austin to join the George W. Bush campaign.  Durin=
g=20
this time of transition I can be reached at my new email address =01)=20
michaelpshannon@yahoo.com or on my cell phone (713-410-6941).  I hope to ha=
ve=20
new contact information to all of you by the first part of April.  God=01,s=
=20
blessings to you for your kindness to me.  Please keep in touch.

Best regards,

Mike

to everybody who showed up and made this weekend one of the most fun
memories ever.  And thanks to Miguel and Blake again for organizing
everything; I couldn't have done it without y'all.  Once I can put more full
sentences together, I'll write more.  Thanks again.

- Bryan

ps  If anybody has seen my Carolina shirt, my cell phone charger, my
American Express card and/or my voice, please bring them to my wedding, too.

Mike-
What a day! I didn't hear from Tara until 4:00 and she worked next door.
She's pretty upset. She said she saw things that she will never forget. I'm
going to pick her up in NJ today. Jean is getting married on Saturday and
most of Jamie's friends are flying in. Have you heard from everybody? Hope
everyone is ok. Talk to you soon.

Michelle

A few more details and a few less people.  It looks like we are going to have 
between 5 and 7 going.  It's kind of important that those of you I haven't 
heard from in the past week or so let me know so that I can get another room 
if necessary.

Porter - I am counting you in, but need to confirm
Rogers - I am counting you in, but need to confirm OB
Stabell - I didn't count you or Iaia, need to confirm

I have got a room reserved at the Flamingo for Thurs - Sun.  I rate it a 
B+hotel, but the other ones are $300-400 for Friday and Saturday.  It is 
older but is on the strip by Bellagio, Caesars, Venetian,etc.  I am still 
working on the Venetian, they will comp Thursday night but say they have no 
availability F&S because of a conference.  I think there is still hope, but I 
probably won't know until the week we go.

The rates at the Flamingo are  59, 169, 169 for 2 double beds.  If there are 
5 of us, maybe we squeeze depending on what everyone wants, if there is more, 
I say get another room.  At 169 a night, its only $100 or less per person for 
both nights, not bad.  If you want your own bed, its going to be an extra $50 
for the weekend.  I don't mind paying it, so if anyone is interested let me 
know ASAP.  Otherwise, there is a strong chance you will be sharing a bed or 
on a couch.

Arrivals
Thursday night  Hilgert, Neff
Friday AM  Gardener
Friday PM  Martin, Rogers, OB, Porter?

I think the first 3 will be playing golf on Friday, we can probably play 
again Saturday if you all want.  I'll set up times, but confirm that you are 
going to play and feel free to suggest a course.  Expect green fee to be $75 
at the cheapest, more likely $125 -150, but you do get what you pay for.


Adios
BN

B, 
Per our conversation I am sending my resume. 
As we talked about I would like to continue down the finance path. I have  
several years of internal financial experience (raising capital, preparing  
models and valuations for presentations), I believe I could learn a great  
deal from the companies you spoke of and gain specific industry knowledge. 
I greatly appreciate your input and look forward to speaking with you in the  
future. 
Best Regards, 
Cliff Carnes

it could be today, but with the nasty weather it is probably better to
postpone, as for tomorrow i have a meeting all morning and then we could
meet for a late afternoon lunch or even early evening happy hour to
celebrate bush's victory. so let me know if sometime late tomorrow works,
otherwise possibly friday. although i may be down in houston since i need to
go to a pool table place off of the southwest freeway near Gessner and then
in town to meet a buddy from el paso.

Ben -

I likewise was glad to see you.  Sorry we didn't have a chance to talk.

Good to hear you're doing well.  You're with a great group and, yes, the company will soon be doing a lot better.

Thanks,

Ken

Mr. Lay:
It was good to see you down on the trading floor today.  I have been in the power trading group for about a year now.  I came over from the corp. development group after we sold the peakers to Allegheny and to Cinergy.  I was the one who convinced my Dad to buy those two peakers.
The power trading group is a really solid group of individuals.  Sitting where I do I see and hear alot of what goes on in the heart on Enron and I feel that this part of the company is doing really well.  
I have been with Enron for over four years now and I continue to learn alot as well as contribute to Enron's bottom line.  Eventhough Enron's stock price has come off a little I still think this is a great company and that the overall fundamentals are very sound.  I hope all is going well! 

Regards,
Ben

Hey Ben,

How is life in Texas?  Have you met that guy Rob McDonald I know from DC?
He is good friends with my cousin Eddy Quinn.  Life has gotten rather boring
out here. We have a ton of work to do and work long hours with no days off.
This work style in the beginning made time fly but recently the monotony of
the routine has gotten mundane.  We all live for port calls and push the
envelope of ethical billing while in port.  I have been shot down by every
school I applied for.  How about you?  They can all blow me as I would
probably outperform all of those faggots with high GMATs.  That has been my
achilles heel.  Right now I am focused on the summer and getting off this
ship.

I hope I get in the marathon because I have been training for so long.
There is nothing else to do except that in my free time.  If I don't have a
goal to shoot for then I could never keep up this training on land.  The
summer will be the hardest because I am going to want to travel and visit
people when I get back.  Any plans to be in NY this summer?

I have been messing around with stocks too.  I have made only a little since
the tech crash.  I stay away from those Internet companies so I didn't get
killed.  See you in the summer.

CHOB

I would love to have lunch one day.  Call Cindy and get on my calendar.  It 
was nice to hear from you!  I am glad everything is going well.

Stan


P.S.   Hello, Ben!    This is Cindy.    I just wanted to let you know that 
Stan has recently decided to open up, print, and reply to all of his own 
e-mails.    He did receive your initial e-mail and had typed up this message 
but saved it as a 'draft' and never sent it to you.   I just so happened to 
look in his 'draft' folder yesterday and saw this message, asked him about 
it, and he said to forward it on to you.     So, he hasn't been ignoring you 
(ha)...he just forgot to send the draft message.   This is just between you 
and me, okay?    ha ha     Don't joke with him about this....he's trying to 
become more knowledgeable in the technical area.    I just hope he doesn't 
decide to get rid of me!  ha ha      Have a great day and call me to set up a 
lunch with Stan.

Who ever has Cliff and Deirdre should get the kind of VCR that marks the
commercials and when you play back the recorded TV show, it SKIPS the
commercials.  Yes, technology is a wonderful thing.  Everyone witnessed it
here when we watched a taped episode of the West Wing.  It's a little extra,
but well worth it.

As you know, technology is critical to Enron; it drives our success and wil=
l=20
continue to do so in the future. Technology has helped Enron create new=20
businesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is=20
responsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com.  You=
=01,ve=20
seen what technology can do at work.  Now we want you and your family to=20
realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=
he=20
ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20
technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=
=20
click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=
=20
Internet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=
=20
the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=
=20
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=
=20
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20
ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=
=20
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20
employed at the time of implementation. =20
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=
ry=20
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of=
=20
your initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=
=20
http://clickathome.enron.com.  We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne=
ar=20
future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can=20
submit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com.=20

We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your=20
family.  We believe this program takes communication at Enron to a new leve=
l=20
by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in=
=20
the broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe=
=20
Enron is a great place to work.

Michael:
Just wanted to let you know that I just talked to Don Miller, the lead guy
from our side, regarding a different matter, but he mentioned to me that
things seemed to be not going so well in the PSA discussions.  I didn't
have time to see what the issues were, but I will when he calls back.  As
you already know, these assets are yours to lose and I would hate to see
you guys lose these assets to legal issues.  I know we both can come to
some middle ground before people lose their patience.  My only advice, for
what its worth, is to keep talking with Delainey and to make sure the
lawyers don't run away with the issues and forget whats at stake on the
commercial side.  Hope this helps.
Ben

The recruiting season has officially begun.  The first Super Saturday weeke=
nd=20
is the weekend of October 27th and 28th.  We have undergone a rigorous=20
interview process on campus, which will allow us to focus on =01&selling=01=
8=20
candidates that are invited to Houston for Super Saturday.  Students will=
=20
arrive on Friday afternoon and will depart on Sunday morning.  We have=20
activities planned for the entire weekend.  The goal is to implement a Supe=
r=20
Saturday process that allows for consistent and meaningful hiring decisions=
=20
while also allowing the candidates exposure to a greater number of Enron=20
employees.  To that end, we have made the following changes:
Friday Evening Dinner.    The dinners will be held at the same restaurant. =
 =20
We will provide transportation for all candidates.  We will continue to hav=
e=20
small tables of six individuals that will include two (2) Enron employees a=
nd=20
four (4) students.  There will be a group cocktail hour at the restaurant=
=20
before the dinner.  This will enable the Enron employees to meet and evalua=
te=20
more students.  It will also give the students broader exposure to Enron=20
employees.
Saturday Interviews.   Interviewers will receive their interview packages=
=20
(schedules and resumes) at breakfast on Saturday morning. This will=20
facilitate last minute cancellations of interviewers and/or candidates.  We=
=20
have allowed time to review resumes before the interview process. To=20
facilitate the completion of the evaluation form on each student, the=20
interviewers will remain in an assigned interview room and the students wil=
l=20
rotate.=20
In prior years, the interviewers have interviewed eight (8) candidates. =20
Interviewers will now interview only five (5) candidates.  The remainder of=
=20
the time will be spent in the decision-making meeting. It is essential that=
=20
all interviewers attend the decision-making meeting and that all evaluation=
=20
forms are completed and input prior to the meeting.=20
Decision-Making Meeting.   Rather than asking the interviewers to return on=
=20
Monday afternoon, we will hold the decision-making meeting on Saturday=20
following the interviews and lunch.  The meetings are scheduled from 1:30 P=
M=20
to 3:30 PM and will be facilitated by members of Enron=01,s executive manag=
ement=20
team.  Dave Delainey will facilitate the October 28 meeting.  Kevin Hannon,=
=20
Jeff Shankman, John Lavorato, Rick Causey and Dan Leff will facilitate=20
subsequent meetings.=20
Need for interviewers.  There has been a tremendous response to the call fo=
r=20
dinner participants; however, we are still in need of interviewers for each=
=20
of the Super Saturdays.  Please respond with your willingness to interview=
=20
at:  http://axis.enron.com/notice/ssinvite.asp   =20
(When selecting dates please avoid selecting to interview candidates who=20
attend the schools for which you are a team member).
We thank you in advance for your participation and support of the program.

employer

assistance.

Also, if you come across anyone that could utilize my services, please
refer them to me. We do offer a $500 referral bonus for accounting and
tax professionals that are hired by our clients. Thank you in advance
for doing so.

Ben,

Blotter has a selection that needs to be checked in order to display EOL deals.
The system shows that you don't have that check box checked.
If that's the problem than all that you need to do is to check that box:

1. In Blotter use the "Clear" button to clear any deals that may already show.
2. Go to "Defaults" on the menu.
3. Select the only option there ("Startup/New Deals Defaults...")
4. Make sure you have "Show EOL Deals" checked.

 

If this is not the issue, please give me a call at 5-7265.

Thanks!
Nikolay

Jack:
I hope that you remember me.  We played golf together at The Breakers
course about three weeks ago.  I am currently working in Enron's power
trading group, but prior to this I was in Enron's corporate development
group.  I mentioned to you that my Dad is Jim Rogers, Chairman and CEO of
Cinergy Corp., which is a mid size ($5.4 Bil.)  utility located in
Cincinnati.  He has been CEO of this company for over 13 years and is
always looking for ways to grow his company through strategic acquisitions.
In the past he has talked to some of your bankers, but I would like to try
and get you two together, to see if there is something your companies can
work on together.  I really think the two of you could have a successful
meeting.  He is very  forward thinking and is quite open to new ideas and
creative structures.  His contact information is listed below.  I hope all
is going well and again, it was a pleasure to have met you and play golf
with you at your club.  Please let me know if you need any additional
information.

Hi everyone.  Hope you all had a great Thanksgiving.
We had a great time in Chicago and are waiting to see
if it will happen again next year :-)  Just kidding
Michaela!

Okay, we need everyone to put in their wish lists so
some of us can start our shopping.  Please try and
give a couple of suggestions for yourselves-not just
one-in case we can't get something!  Also, I don't
think all adults have put in suggestions for their
children.

Once again, is it $125.00 per couple and $30.00 for
children??????  Also, what about the gift for Mom and
Dad??  Hope to hear from you all soon!
Megan

By the way, some suggestions for Ben and I---
anything we registered for that we didn't get
(Ross-Simons)
Any Spode stuff (except glasses)
I'll think of some other stuff

If I were President George W. Bush's Speech Writer. By Mitchell R. Robb

Good evening my fellow Americans.
First, I want to pass on my condolences to the people of New York and all
Americans that are hurting in this tragic time. You can rest assured that
anything and everything that can be done to assure the safety of our country
will be done.
This is the greatest country in the world and we will get through this
trying
time.
Now is the time for all people to set aside our petty differences and
show the world that no one or nothing can destroy the fortitude of the
American people.
To the people responsible for today's tragedy, I say this: Are you fucking
kidding me? Are the turbans on your heads wrapped too tight?
Have you gone too long without a bath? Do you not know who you are fucking
with? Americans are so hungry to kill, that we shoot at each other every
day.
We will relish that opportunity for new targets for our aggression. Have you
forgotten history? What happened to the last people that started fucking
around with us? Remember the little yellow bastards over in Japan? We
slapped
them all over the Pacific and roasted about 2 million of them in their own
back yard. That's what we in America call a big ass barbecue. Ever seen
Texas
on a map? Ever wonder why it's so big? Because  we wanted it that way,
Mexico
started jacking around with the Alamo and now they cut our lawns. England?
We
sent them packing. Ask your buddy Saddam about fucking with the good 'ole
USA. The only reason he got away the first time is because it's too hard to
shoot someone when you're doubled over laughing at them. Our soldiers aren't
trained to laugh and shoot at the same time. Now he couldn't stop a pack of
cub scouts from taking over his shitty little country. Trust us, Afghanistan
will end up a giant kitty litter box. Go ahead and try to hide, Bin Laden.
There's not a hole deep enough or a mountain high enough that's going to
keep
your camel riding asses safe. We will bomb every inch of the country that
harbors him, his camps and any place that looks and even smells like he was
there. Hell, we might even drop a few bombs on people that have pissed us
off
in the past. This is America. We kick ass. This is what we do. Go ahead and
laugh now, but the Tomahawks are coming and we will smoke your sorry asses.
God bless America!

make it down to houston will call you. I had an old GE Capital friend over
for dinner this week with his family. Tom Kalb works at Enron now and lives

he just got transferred and is now in some finance group. take care. charlie

Ben, 
Hope you had fun in Martha's Vineyard.  Bet you are glad to have Megan back.   
I am sure CBCIII could not survive without me for more than a couple of  
days..... 
Can you send your dad and MA's and your mom and Dale's address.  They sent us  
a wonderful and very generous gift. 
Stay cool in that Houston August. 
Hope to see you soon.

Dear Ben,

Unfortunately, I have some bad news.  I just received a fax from Sidney who
reported that your application is going to be rejected notwithstanding the
fact that he wrote a letter in support.  Please give me a call and let's
discuss.

Dad

Ben!
Whats happening down in HOuston?  Got some big news on my end - I am moving
out to San Diego to start a job with Nicholas-Applegate Capital Management.
I've been on vaca, working on my golf game and tan since graduating Cornell
in May and move out this week.  Looking forward to the job and the
lifestyle - I'll be living a few blocks from the beach and never have to see
snow again!  I'll send along full contact info once I get fully settled in a
couple of weeks.  COme visit if you are ever out that way.  Hope all is
well.
Pete

Oh fine day!

You have sent my heart soaring with news that you have agreed to receive
some of this Fool's earnestly penned electronic missives!

I hope you will find my correspondence entrancing but I shall be honest:
what these notes occasionally lack in charm they make up for in
convenience and persistence. The word passed along to me is that you have
elected to receive the following note(s):

FoolWatch
Breakfast with the Fool
Investing Basics
Fresh Stuff
Special Offers From The Motley Fool

I shall do my best to make sure the letters are dispatched with both
substance and speed. Shall you ever change your mind and decide to select
more notes or (gasp!) fewer, simply click the link below and you shall be
transported to a page where you can change your choices.

http://www.fool.com/community/freemail/emailenter.htm

Looking forward to our pen pal relationship. :-)

Foolishly,
Will Somers
Chief Jester-in-Residence

P.S. 'Twill be one day before your first letter arrives.

P.P.S. If you believe that this email was sent to you in error (perhaps
by someone with careless fingers?) and you don't wish to receive these
free newsletters, please drop a note to unsubscribe@fool.com.

Ben,

DC is still treating me well.  10 years here and still going.  My wife and I
moved into our new home in June.  So I've been getting settled in the new
place all summer, real busy but it's been fun.  Just had the 1 year
anniversary, can't believe it's been that long.  Flather Hall, Kitty's, and
'box' seem like yesterday...

Marlon's wedding sounds like fun, too bad it's Homecoming weekend.  Would be
nice to see everybody.  We need to make some plans and all get together
soon.  The marathon sounds great, good luck, the only running I have time
for these days is from Home Depot and back to the house. But I manage to go
to the gym a few days a week to maintain my 250 lbs slim figure.

I still hang out with Penney and his new little girl, never thought he would
be the first to have a baby.  Saw Ken and Theo a few weeks ago in DC.  Dolan
and Sofie are now in San Fran and I talk to him from time to time.

Hard to make plans with a big bunch of people.  Sometimes you just gotta
make the plans with a few and throw it out there for the rest of the group.
Let me know if you have any ideas or possible locations.  Maybe just plan a
weekend somewhere, DC or otherwise and try to get as many people together.
Maybe a big party or something like that.  We'll hire Vince O'Neill to
organize it.  An un-official homecoming party.

See ya

 Luke:
 How are ya?  How is the DC area these days?  Houston is still
fucking hot
 and Enron is still doing well and the price is still screaming so
things
 are good.  In response to your inquiry regarding Homecoming.  Megan
and I
 are actually, if you can believe it, going to Marlon and Marissa's
wedding
 the first weekend in October in NJ.  Also, OB, Chobu, Mike, Corpina
and
 Danny, Patty D, Sammy, Amy, etc. are going as well - should be
interesting.
 I haven't seen some of those people for quite awhile.  I was trying
to set
 something up, but that came up as well as I'm running in this year's
NYC
 Marathon, which is the first Sunday in Novemebr, so trying to
arrange
 something became even harder.  I still want to get together with you
guys,
 but trying to figure out when and where.  Suggestions are welcomed.
Hope
 all is going well and talk to you soon.
 Ben

Attached is our first Turbine Position Report.  We intend to issue this

report by turbine as well as three summary reports:

Summary by Status
Summary by Controlling Region

Some of the financial data in this report is preliminary.  I will be working 
with the respective regional accounting groups to establish procedures for 
financial updates on a regular basis.  In the meantime, I welcome any 
corrections / suggestions you may have.

Ben, I've got a pulled muscle (groin) that I've been trying to nurse for a
few months.  Went for a run this weekend and strained it.  I wonder if we
could either postpone tennis for a week or so?  If you prefer - I could -
but will have to take it fairly easy.  Let me know.  Dave.

Elizabeth and I would like to thank everyone who came to our wedding and
shower.  It wouldn't have been the same without all of your participation.
We have returned from our honeymoon in Hawaii and are now moved into our new
apartment here in NYC.  We are now trying to move all of our wedding and
shower gifts into our little one bedroom apartment.  It's a good problem to
have, though.  If you are ever in town, please give us a call.  Thanks again
and we look forward to seeing you in the near future.

heard nothing.

I'll get back to you

Well,

Laurel told me you are interested in crewing in the upcoming Circuit race
(11th & 12th).  Sounds good.  How much experience to you have on the pointy
end of the boat??

I have a tentative crew but he would like to do middle and tactics.  He was
supposed to get back with me over the weekend but has not done so yet.

Laurel mentioned that you know someone else.  They have any experience??

How are you on tactics??

Greg

Hey Mike,
Thanks for the pics.  Where were the ones from which  looks to be a wedding?
Hey, how many tickets were you thinking about? Were you thinking two for you
and
your Dad?  That weekend is April 1 & 3, 2000.  I'm not sure whether that is
Easter weekend or not.  One other way to get tics is to go to
www.finalfourseats.com  Let me know your situation.  Where are you spending
the
New Year?  Talk to you later.
Ben

Ben,

I hope I passed the test........The retreat went very well.  I've been
thinking about your role at Cinergy and have concluded that involvement in
the DG area is the best place for you to grow and develop as an executive.
The assignment will be tough because you will be front running the market.
But, the opportunity to develop an expertise in marketing in this area will
be invaluable if the industry develops as I believe it will.  Let's talk.

Dad

Thank you for your message.  I had a good day yesterday eating at Brennan's, 
manicure, shopping, drinking with friends, etc.
Now the fun has ended and the rest of my life working begins.  I don't know 
how I feel about that.

Have a good day!  Talk to you soon.  Is the Marathon this weekend?  If so, 
good luck.  I wouldn't want to say "break a leg."

PRC Representatives
Thank you for your participation in the year-end 2000 PRC.  Listed below are 
the Associates/Analysts you will be representing:



As you may know, the final PRC will be conducted on December 12th (Analysts) 
and December 13th (Associates).  Your participation in these meetings is 
essential.  Prior to that date, each business unit has been asked to conduct 
a pre-rating meeting to determine each employee's pre-rating.  The 
pre-ratings will be loaded into the PEP system.  The PEP system is open and 
available for employees to select reviewers.  You have been listed as a 
secondary supervisor so that you may review each of your Associates/Analysts 
feedback.  You are responsible for contacting the Supervisor and/or 
Associates/Analysts to discuss and obtain valuable performance information.  
The Associate and Analyst Programs will also provide you with a copy of the 
completed feedback for each of the people you represent once the PEP system 
is closed.  The more information that you can secure regarding your 
Associates/Analysts will ensure that each person is cross-calibrated 
correctly at the final PRC.  If you are a new PRC Representative and are 
unsure of the process, please contact either Jana Giovannini at x3-9233 or 
Shelly Butler at x3-4584 with any questions.

Supervisors
You should approve/add/delete the reviewers selected by the 
Associates/Analysts that work in your group.  You should then consolidate 
this feedback including your over-all thoughts, which should be presented at 
your business unit pre-rating meeting.  If your business unit is not 
conducting a pre-rating meeting due to it's size, please make sure that the 
rating you provide is loaded into the PEP system prior to the final PRC.  
Please contact the PEP help desk at x3-4777 option 4 or Terry Bosien at 
x3-5230 if you are unable to load this data yourself.  You should wait to 
provide feedback to your Associates/Analysts until the final decisions have 
been made to avoid any confusion.  All pre-ratings are subject to the final 
cross-calibration and may change in the final PRC meeting.  You are 
responsible for contacting the PRC Representative listed above whom will be 
representing your Associates/Analysts prior to the final PRC.  Keep in mind 
that the more information you can provide, either verbal or written, will 
ensure that the final PRC is a success.

Associates/Analysts
You are responsible for selecting your reviewers.  You should have received 
your logon ID and password from the PEP team.  If you have not received this, 
please contact x3-4777 option 4 with questions.  Please go into the system 
and select your reviewers.  Your direct supervisor may let you know how many 
people to select and will be ultimately responsible for approving your 
reviewers.  Remember that it is important to select a broad range of 
reviewers that include internal/external customers at any level.  You will 
also be asked to complete feedback on yourself.  Be sure to take the 
opportunity to detail your accomplishments and specific ways in which you 
have added value to your unit.  This is your chance to be heard.  You may 
hear from your PRC Rep to discuss your roles and responsibilities.  If you do 
not, we suggest that you contact them either verbally or in writing.  

An Enfo-session regarding the PRC is being held at 3:30pm on November 1, 2000 
at the Doubletree Hotel, La Salle Ballroom A for all Associates and 
Analysts.  We encourage you to attend.  Final PRC results should be 
communicated to the Supervisor by 12/31/00.  The feedback should be 
communicated to the Associates/Analysts by 1/15/01.  If the 
Associates/Analysts have not received feedback by the deadline, they should 
contact their Career Development Manager (Jana Giovannini x3-9233 or Shelly 
Butler x3-4584).  Thank you for your cooperation and we look forward to a 
successful final PRC

Charlene,
Hope you do not mind a direct (email) solicitation, but I was referred to you 
by Ben Rogers who I have recently met in my new
position with Pulp & Paper on the 29th floor. I have a friend who is 
interested in a Finance-related
position with Enron.   I think you will find his resume to include a broad 
base of education and experience
that would fit in with this company.

If you have a need for someone of his background, please feel free to contact 
him directly.
I have attached his resume for your review.

Thanks very much,

Camille

DO YOU THINK HE WOULD??
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
 Al Gore and 
Constitution 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
, 2000 WorldNetDaily.com 

Ever since I saw Al Gore give that uncharacteristically statesman-like speech 
defending the integrity of the Electoral College system under the 
Constitution of the United States, I've been scratching my head trying to 
figure it out. 

Who was this guy? Was this the same Al Gore who has demonstrated -- time and 
time again -- so little respect for the Constitution during the last eight 
years? Why was he giving up on the idea of a challenge to the Electoral 
College, when it seemed many in his camp were banking on that as their last 
line of defense? 

Well, I think I have figured it out. Actually, there are two possibilities. 

The first thought that came to me was that this was Al Gore's 
"Don't-watch-the-man-behind-the-curtain speech." While he was extolling the 
virtues of the Constitution, his minions in Florida -- from Bill Daley to 
Jesse Jackson -- were busy subverting it by any means necessary. It was Al 
Gore's way of establishing public plausible deniability. He stood above the 
fray, while his cohorts did the dirty work. 

But, more recently, another thought has occurred to me -- a darker, more 
sinister thought. I hope I am wrong. I pray that, this time, I am 
overestimating the deviousness of Al Gore. But that, of course, is always a 
difficult task. 

Think, for a moment, why Al Gore would suddenly be reading and citing the 
Constitution. 

The answer is that, in this instance, it gives him all the power. What do I 
mean? 

Who is it, under the Constitution, that is specifically charged with 
certifying the Electoral College votes of each state? You guessed it. The 
president of the U.S. Senate, which also happens to be the vice president of 
the United States. That's right. The day those Electoral College votes go to 
the Senate to be counted and certified to choose the next president of these 
United States, Al Gore will be holding all the cards. 

"Oh, Farah," you say, "you don't think Al Gore would tamper with the results 
in any way with the whole world watching, do you?" 

Well, let's think about what has been happening in Florida for the last 
several days. Al Gore's campaign managers have been whipping up hysteria 
stating that the will of the people in that state is being subverted. 

They are filing lawsuits. They are organizing marches. They are all but 
accusing the Bush campaign of voter fraud. 

Listen to what Bill Daley has to say: "More than 100 million Americans voted 
on Tuesday and more voted for Al Gore than George Bush. Here in Florida it 
also seems very likely that more voters went to the polls believing that they 
were voting for Al Gore than for George Bush. If the will of the people is to 
prevail Al Gore should be awarded a victory in Florida, and be our next 
president of the United States." 

They've decided that no matter what the actual vote count shows, Gore wins. 

Now, all Gore has to do on that fateful day in the U.S. Senate is reject for 
certification the Electoral College votes of Florida, and he wins the 
majority and becomes president. Sorry, Bush fans. I don't think there's a 
thing you can do about it other than protest, complain and stomp your feet. 
Better start planning your legal strategy now. I'll bet Al Gore's transition 
team is already hard at work. Barbra Streisand is probably making plans to 
sing at the Inauguration. Alec Baldwin is unpacking his bags. This could be a 
fait accompli. I guarantee you a counter to this bold move is not in the Bush 
campaign's playbook. 

The Gore campaign, still working overtime, has laid the groundwork for the 
challenge. The Florida vote is tainted, they say. It's too close to call. Too 
many irregularities. The vote can simply be dismissed by the constitutional 
authority -- Vice President Al Gore. 

Would you put it past him? I sure wouldn't.

Ben,
Are you loking more for focused refresher work?
I can certainly try and get something set up. The main problem I may have is
staffing.
I will send out an email to my GMAT instructors and find out if my really
good teachers have any time outside of their jobs and teaching. Evenings are
best? How about your weekends? When are you planning on re-testing?
I will return your call as soon as I can. We are a little short staffed so I
am on the phone a bit more than normal.
Thanks!
Amy

Amy:
I called a while back to get into the Enron class which you helped me get
into and I just recently left you a message to take private sessions from
the Princeton Review.  I have realized that I need  one on one  sessions to
help me really prepare for the GMAT.  If you can point me in the right
direction, I would greatly appreciate it.  I was looking to start sessions
as soon as possible. Again, thanks for your help with this issue.

Excellent time! Look forward to keeping it going at the wedding, Elizabeth
will be so impressed. Speaking of keeping it going, our good friend, Mr.
Kimzey, called me last night drunk as rodeo goat at about 10 PM asking me to
go out and party a little bit more. Did I miss something or did we not get
our share this weekend?

Apparently the weekend only caused Bryan to reflect on his current state of
affairs. By chance it was just the welts on his forehead from crushing cans
that caused him to start boozing all by his lonesome yesterday. Or perhaps
he just wanted to enjoy the perks of first class. Let's hope it was the
latter and had nothing to do with the frightful prospect of being a married
man in just 6 weeks.

Oh, by the way, I can assure you all Kimzey has not read a single one of
these emails yet, and likely won't till about noon. Damn slackers over there
at CSFB!

Great weekend - thanks to Miquel for getting us all there and hopefully

Ben,

Went up to Philly for the holiday. Jeanne and I hung out at Gioffre's on
Sunday for the Eagles-Redskins game.  He is doing well. Spoke with JV, he is
still enjoying being single and grabbing everything he can.

We are going skiing in PA in January, and we hope to go out west sometime
this ski season.  Actually, McGrath and Dolan are living in San Fran and
they said they might get a house for the ski season somewhere.  Sounds like
a good time.

I think 'W' will pull it off.  This whole thing is a crazy mess and I can't
wait for it to be done.  Gore was actually scary last night on TV.  I can't
believe the D's nominated him as their candidate.

Let us know if you are coming to DC. Talk to you later.

Luke

Hey:
Sorry about not getting back sooner - I have been traveling and was away
for Thanksgiving.  Megan and I went up to Chicago to visit one of her 5
sisters.  M&M's wedding was fun, saw some people I haven't seen since
college - pretty scary.  If "W" wins this election Megan and I are coming
to DC to watch the Inaugeration and maybe go to a ball or two, so we should
diffinently get together.  I will work on that when the time comes.
Besides, this election is absolutely crazy - Gore he working himself into
complete retirement with all this contesting.  How is everything going?
What are you guys doing for the holiday?  Megan and I are going out west to
do some skiing in Beaver Creek - I'm praying for powder.  Again, I hope all
is going well and I'll be better next time about getting back to you.  Good
to hear from you!
Ben

Dear Ben:

I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to meet you during 
the Super Saturday.

I am waiting with anxiety for the final results and I am very confident that 
the skills that I have built in the past constitute a good basis for dealing 
with the demands of the firm in the present.

Thank you once again for your time and your contribution to the Event.

Sincerely,

How did you do on the test you took right after your class ended?
Because if you are interested in refreshing and are within the guarantee,
you can sit through again for free and get extra help from your instructor.
You have the right to re-take the course as long as you have taken all of
your practice tests, attended all classes or made up if you missed, done all
homework and took your actual exam within 30 days.
If you did all of that and are unhappy with your score for whatever
reason....you can repeat for free. I have classes starting Nov. 18 here at
the office that I can get you into and you could test either in late January
when they end or if you feel comfident before that then certainly
mid-January.
Let me know what you think.

Thanks for the reply.  I can understand your position.  I am looking more
for a refresher course.  I am planning on taking it around mid December or
as late as mid January.  I am beginning to start studying again on my own,
but I wanted to get a little more help.  Thanks for your call!

Hello Again,

Most of may have thought that I jumped ship in Malaysia to become a beach
bum but unfortunately I didn't.  We just spent a long 4 weeks at sea that
was not easy.  It is more the boredom of routine that slows the time down.
The team was getting a bit touchy with each other and everyone needed a
break.  We pulled into Bahrain in the Persian Gulf and it was a good time to
recharge.  We all survived the break and are now back out in the Persian
Gulf.  We will in the Persian Gulf until the end of May.  The ship's
aircraft fly everyday over Southern Iraq enforcing Operation Southern Watch,
the No-Fly zone.  The aircraft have been engaged by surface-to-air missiles
and anti-aircraft artillery.  The aircraft then bomb them into oblivion with
laser guided bombs.  I have seen the footage and it is pretty devastating.
Still the Iraq's light up their gun radars, though.  The Cruiser and
Destroyers of the Battle Group are on a different mission which is the
Maritime Intercept Operation of the UN.  This is the enforcement of oil
embargoes on Iran and Iraq for UN sanctions.  The ships stop the freighters
or tankers and then send in Navy Seals or Marines to search the ship.  I
have seen the footage of this and it is unbelievable the instant
coordination that goes on.

Below is my adventure in Bahrain and some pictures to go with them.  See you
all in the summer!

After 4 long weeks out to sea the Stennis finally weighed anchor at the port
of Bahrain.  The whole team was very relieved to have a day off after 29
days straight of working 10-14 hour days.

Day 1
They called the liberty call at 10 AM, which is earlier then they have ever
called it. I was caught in the shower so I had to rush to finish up.  My
bags had been packed for days so I was able to catch up with the rest of the
team in the Hanger Bay.  They have a new system called a Smart Card system
that logs everyone in and out of the ship. This always causes a 10-15 minute
delay.  After this though there are always plenty of boats to take us pier
side.  We hopped on one and rode the 4 miles into the dock area.  It was a
heavily industrious harbor and the water, though warm, looked a bit
polluted.  Tons of jellyfish were also seen throughout the water.  We then
walked about a half-mile down the pier and into the American Naval Base that
was there.  The gates and barricades to this place were heavier then the
White House and more heavily defended.  For most of the ship, they were not
granted overnight liberty and so the base would the focus of there
relaxation. There were bars setup and all sorts of activities planned.  We
caught a cab to our hotel, the Le Meridien that was the nicest in Bahrain
and had its own private beach.  The hotel was like an oasis in the desert
because it was outside the main city of Manama and surrounded by scrub
desert.  At the gate of the hotel an armed guard with a machine gun searched
the trunk of the cab.  Inside the hotel there were all Saudi's. It was the
end of the Hajj, their most religious time of the year, and they all come to
Bahrain to drink, smoke, and do other sins against Allah.  The whole ship
was told explicitly to stay out of their way by the XO of the ship.  Our
rooms weren't ready so we dumped our bags and went out to the pool caf, for
some lunch.  Lunch was a huge buffet spread that had shwarma's, Persian
rice, and all sorts of good Mid East food. We ate and drank for a couple of
hours.  I then got my room and changed to go to the beach.  The beach was
man-made and enclosed by a lagoon where I sat in the sun the rest of the
afternoon.  At 7PM some of us met to go get some drinks before dinner.  We
walked to the Trader Vic's next to the hotel and found it open but empty.
They apparently don't believe in happy hour.  We had some drinks and ate
there.  At 11 PM we left there to go meet up with some people from the ship
at an Irish Pub. They had Guinness on tap so I was happy.  We followed most
of the pilots from the Stennis to the Warbler that had a band that rocked
until 2 AM.  We then returned exhausted to the hotel and after making some
embarrassing late night calls (which of course is daytime in the States) to
friends, I went to sleep.
Day 2
The second day started much later as I was sleeping spread eagle on my king
sized bed and didn't want to leave it-ever.  I stumbled to the beach with a
headache and sat on the beach for the entire afternoon.  The 4weeks at sea
had apparently wiped out my tolerance.  I walked around the lagoon and took
it easy.  Since I realized that most restaurant did not start the food
service until 9 PM I decided to eat a late lunch at 4 PM which consisted of
the same incredible buffet as the day before.  We all met up in the club
level of the hotel around 8 PM for drinks before we decided to eat.  I was
not feeling to great but decided to join some of the people who were going
to the Italian restaurant that was located inside the hotel.  This was an
exceptional place where the food was very good.  The Veal Milanese rivaled
the best I have had in the States.  I felt much better after that and was
willing to join the rest of the group going out to a nightclub.  The
nightclub turned out to be pretty dead and at 2AM we called it a night.
Day 3
I woke up around 12PM and again had to fight to get out of bed.  I had set
my A/C to very cold and was buried under many soft blankets.  I met up with
a few people and ate lunch at the caf, on the beach. We then walked over to
the lagoon and sat on the beach over there for the rest of the afternoon.
The best thing about it was that there was a golfcart that drove around with
drinks and snacks for everyone.  I read my book and dozed most of the
afternoon.   The sun was never particular strong the whole time we were
there which I think was do to the amount of dust from the Saudi desert 30
miles across the Persian Gulf.  It reduces visibility across the entire Gulf
and into Iran.  3 of us decided to do the tourist thing in Bahrain later in
the afternoon.  The only thing we were told to go see was this new mall that
was built.  To me it was just like seeing any other mall except it was a
little smaller then US malls.  I didn't buy anything but it was interesting
to look at prices that were about double US standards.  You can haggle for
any price including a pair of socks but you couldn't get them to US prices.
Everything on Bahrain is imported because it is an island.  Upon returning
to the hotel around 8PM we met up with a group that was going to the
Lebanese restaurant inside the hotel.  This was also rated the best in
Bahrain.  It was quite a feast with 5 main courses spread from 10 PM until 2
AM with bellydancers and singers entertaining everyone.  It was in a huge
tent with beautiful Persian carpets everywhere.  I never ate so much and had
a great time. I literally rolled into bed.
Day 4
Our last day since we had to get back on the ship tonight.  Liberty expired
at 6 AM in the morning and it too much of a hassle to try and go in the AM.
I woke up and spent most of the day doing PwC paperwork by dialing in.
There were hundreds of junk emails to toss out and maybe 5 real messages
over 4 weeks of no connection.  I had the usual time and expense Nazis
screaming at me to sign timesheets.  After 3 months and multiple
explanations they still don't get that I have no connectivity.  I can't wait
to see that appear on my GCF.  I got most of what I needed done.  I then
needed to get my watch fixed and set out to find an Omega dealer in Bahrain.
After following at least 6 peoples directions to places they swore were
there, I gave up and would wait until Dubai.  Dubai is a larger city and has
multiple Omega dealers.  For our final meal we decided to again stay at the
hotel.  There was an excellent Indian restaurant in the hotel.  I couldn't
tell you the Indian name for the food I ordered but it was curry chicken and
a basmati rice/lamb combination.  Again I ate way too much and had to roll
out of there.  We packed up and headed to ship around 10 PM.

All in all it was great to get away from the ship for a couple of days after
the 4-week binge.  Bahrain doesn't have much to it and is basically
supported by all the Saudi's who drive across every weekend to party.  The
American base is tiny there.  I am glad the next 3 stops in the Persian Gulf
will be Dubai.  I was also told that Dubai has better values on gold and
rugs.  From now on all of our at-sea-periods will be around two weeks, Thank
God!

Ben,
Thanks for having us up to Beaver Creek this weekend.  We had a wonderful
time.  I told Raul that Colorado needs to be our vacation every summer bc
this was our best one by far!  Anyway, it was a fun spending time with you
guys and your parents in such a relaxing place.

We need to get together soon and share pictures.  Also, I don't know if I
can go that long without laughing with and at you!

Tell Megan thanks too!
Amy

It's now 4am on the 14th, and I saw Sheila Brown on NBC holding a missing person sign.  That is the only CUA person I've seen or heard of.  If anyone knows anything please let me know.  Sheila has been very special to me since the first day I met her.
My thoughts and prayers are with everyone!!

I am o.k. So is Kiernan, Dimino, Lytle, Romano. I am at work today at 
the Empire State Building. Security is tight. Only employees with 
picture ID allowed in. Must go through metal detectors and police have 
all streets around Empire State Building blocked off. F-16 fighter jets 
flying overhead to protect building and make me feel a little safer. 
Please let me know if all CUA people are O.K. I am not sure if you know 
her, but my wife's best friend Amy Callahan from CUA, I believe lost her 
boyfriend who worked at Cantor Fitzgerald on the 105th Floor of Tower 1. 
He was a really nice guy. Fitz's brother-in-law alo worked at Cantor 
Fitzgerald on the 104th floor. No Cantor Fitzgerald people have 
reported in and Dimino says no one above the plane crashes were able to 
make it out. Please say a prayer for them. 
Good luck, and let me know if you hear anything.

Dear Friends, 
I have been lucky enough to speak with a few of you today. I wish that 
it was possible to speak to all of you. I, fortunately, have not heard 
any grave news of my friends as of 2am 9/12/01. I would love to hear 
from everyone posted to this note, whom I've not spoken to as yet. I am 
thinking and praying for all of you, your families, and co-workers. 
Please know people everywhere are thinking of everyone in New York. I 
hope you all are well, and will be waiting to hear anything from anyone. 
Your Friend, 
Joe

The use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past fe=
w=20
years.  As a result the Accounts Payable department has seen a rapid increa=
se=20
in the number of invoices and vendors.  With the higher volume, we have=20
reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle.

Although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual=20
employees, they often mail invoices directly to Accounts Payable.  At times=
=20
they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone.  In thes=
e=20
cases we return the invoice to the vendor.  If the employee is designated, =
we=20
try to track him/her down and forward the invoice.  The high level of=20
employee movement among jobs and locations at Enron has made this=20
increasingly challenging.  Either way, we end up doing something less=20
productive than paying invoices.

To maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessa=
ry=20
for research, we request that employees who have pagers, cell phones, and=
=20
other individually billed items such as licenses, subscriptions, etc., pay=
=20
for them by personal check or charge card (if applicable=01*payment instruc=
tions=20
are usually indicated on the invoice) and request reimbursement through=20
employee expense reports.=20

By submitting these charges on your expense report, you can help us reduce=
=20
the amount of time spent researching and forwarding invoices, the number of=
=20
checks generated by Treasury, the number of vendors in our database, and th=
e=20
turnaround time for payment of invoices. =20

Incidentally, Accounts Payable is currently installing a corporate-wide=20
web-based expense reporting system similar to what Enron International has=
=20
used for the past year.  This will make it even easier to file your expense=
=20
report and receive quick reimbursement.

We=01,d like to make this effective immediately.  If you have any questions=
 or=20
suggestions, please contact the Accounts Payable department.

If I were President George W. Bush's Speech Writer. By Mitchell R. Robb

Good evening my fellow Americans.
First, I want to pass on my condolences to the people of New York and all
Americans that are hurting in this tragic time. You can rest assured that
anything and everything that can be done to assure the safety of our country
will be done.
This is the greatest country in the world and we will get through this
trying
time.
Now is the time for all people to set aside our petty differences and
show the world that no one or nothing can destroy the fortitude of the
American people.
To the people responsible for today's tragedy, I say this: Are you fucking
kidding me? Are the turbans on your heads wrapped too tight?
Have you gone too long without a bath? Do you not know who you are fucking
with? Americans are so hungry to kill, that we shoot at each other every
day.
We will relish that opportunity for new targets for our aggression. Have you
forgotten history? What happened to the last people that started fucking
around with us? Remember the little yellow bastards over in Japan? We
slapped
them all over the Pacific and roasted about 2 million of them in their own
back yard. That's what we in America call a big ass barbecue. Ever seen
Texas
on a map? Ever wonder why it's so big? Because  we wanted it that way,
Mexico
started jacking around with the Alamo and now they cut our lawns. England?
We
sent them packing. Ask your buddy Saddam about fucking with the good 'ole
USA. The only reason he got away the first time is because it's too hard to
shoot someone when you're doubled over laughing at them. Our soldiers aren't
trained to laugh and shoot at the same time. Now he couldn't stop a pack of
cub scouts from taking over his shitty little country. Trust us, Afghanistan
will end up a giant kitty litter box. Go ahead and try to hide, Bin Laden.
There's not a hole deep enough or a mountain high enough that's going to
keep
your camel riding asses safe. We will bomb every inch of the country that
harbors him, his camps and any place that looks and even smells like he was
there. Hell, we might even drop a few bombs on people that have pissed us
off
in the past. This is America. We kick ass. This is what we do. Go ahead and
laugh now, but the Tomahawks are coming and we will smoke your sorry asses.
God bless America!

What the hell happened this weekend?  All I can say right now is thank you
to everybody who showed up and made this weekend one of the most fun
memories ever.  And thanks to Miguel and Blake again for organizing
everything; I couldn't have done it without y'all.  Once I can put more full
sentences together, I'll write more.  Thanks again.

Hey Dover,

You are the only one who figured out what the hell I was saying.  So many
people sent back dumbass responses such as your not that fat.  I thought I
was being very creative but obviously not.  I was in Rio for new years and
it was a sick time.  I have some digital pictures I will send you next time
I download to a floppy disk.  The people in Rio were so cool and showing as
much skin as possible is the custom.  I am trying to finish up my
applications while out here and I think I will be submitted by the end of
January.  I hear OB actually has to go back to work!  I hope he can handle
it.  I visited him before Christmas and he was partying like senior year of
college.

I still have not forgotten your wedding gift and am getting it when I am in
the Far East.  Something you guys will always remember-how many slaves do
you think you need, they are real cheap.

Chobs

Good to hear from you.  Happy Anniversary.  Arianna is growing everyday.  I
have been working long hours,
so she looks different every time I come home to her and Kati.  Kati is
well, trying to adjust to motherhood and
constantly watching over the baby.  She is off until September 1.  No major
plans for the summer.  Going to
Boston the third week in July for 5 days.  My golf game is barely treading
above water.  Don't play enough.  Such
is life.  Say hello to Megan and your family for me.  I hope we can get
together when you are in town. Until then, go sox.

Jon

Hey Jon;
Just e-mailing to see how everyone is doing.  Megan and I are going over to
Austin to a resort to celebrate our 1st anniversary - I can't believe it.
I've been trying to work on the golf game, but I'm taking a couple of
graduate business courses at night so that keeps me pretty busy on the
weekends as well.  Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon.
Go Sox!
Ben

I'm having some issues sleeping.  I've been having the worst nightmares I've
had in years and I wake up about 5 times a night sweating.  I think it's
from those damn pig lips.

Subject: FINAL Reminder: Executive Impact & Influence Summary Report


Hello again.  We are now passed the published cutoff to complete feedback,
but have extended the deadline until this Friday, September 1.  This is one
last reminder for you to submit your Self assessment and/or for your
selected team of raters to return their survey score sheets.

The Summary Reports are shipping out late next week.  In order for any
additional data to be included in your report, FSD, our processing partner,
must receive those surveys by Friday.

A Summary Report requires feedback from at least 3 Direct Reports or 3
Peers, or 3 in a combination of the two perspectives.  It is equally
important to obtain your Manager's feedback, as well as for you to provide a
Self assessment.  If your Manager submits his/her feedback, but you do not
have a sufficient number of Direct Report and/or Peer responses, you will
only receive a report with your Manager's responses.

You may wish to send one final reminder to your raters that their data must
be received by September 1.

If you have any questions, please call me.

Ben,

How was the wedding? Homecoming was pretty lame.  I hung out with people
that live in DC, Stanton, etc.  I did see Dave Crocini and Melanie and Kerry
and her husband.  JV did make it down, we got pretty smashed and went to Old
Glory or course.

Ken and Theo were in town this past weekend.  We all went out for dinner
with the Penney's and their new baby. Scary to see JP holding a baby.

How is Texas? I'm sick of the election thing, what's the attitude down
there.

Junell,

Thanks for the pictures.  You are the man.  I'll be waiting for the rest of
them.  Make sure to add Ben Rogers to your email distribution.  I cc'ed him
on this so you'd have his address.  I look forward to seeing you at the
wedding shower and the wedding if you can make it.  Thanks again, buddy.

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

Dear Ben,
We had a meeting at your offices last December where I expressed my interest in pursuing a rotation in your division. As you may remember, you set me a meeting with Jeff Donahue that same evening. I understood back then that it was a bit early in the process.

In August I will be joining the firm as an Associate and now that the management at your division might have a more clear idea of your needs, I would like to reaffirm my interest in pursuing a rotation at your department. I am confident that the skills that I have built in the past constitute a good basis for dealing with the demands of the group in the present.

I would also very much appreciate if you could give me any suggestions in order to maximize my chances.
I would fly to Houston in order to meet with and whomever you think appropriate at your request.
I am attaching my updated resume. Please pass it around.

I will give you a call in a couple of days.

Best regards,

Teseo Bergoglio

Below is an unbelievably chilling account of one person's experience
yesterday.
I hope this finds you all safe and well.

Adrienne Greenheart, Writer
I was one who wanted a better look. I wanted to get closer. And the price I
paid was leaving my shoes in the middle of a pile of suffocating bodies.  At
the Wall St. train stop people were covered with papers.  A plane crash.
That's what everyone said.  Then a boom.  Everyone ran.  I ran to my office
on Wall and Pearl and called my brother in Illinois.
I wanted to be closer.  At the corner of Church and Broadway, I angled my
way
through a large, packed crowd to get the best view.  We talked about people
jumping.  The police stood behind the yellow tape.  Minutes later, there was
a boom.  I thought it was a bomb, so I crouched, but people ran, so I ran.
I
couldn't see anything.  I don't know how far I ran.  Couldn't see where I
was
running.  Didn't know if I was in a street or next to a building. Didn't
know
what street I was on.  No one could talk because the dust filled our
throats.
  After about ten steps I tripped over a pile of people and then people
tripped on me.
I laid there. The only sound was the falling of dust and debris.  No one
moved under me.  The weight of people on top of me got heavier.  I couldn't
breathe. I knew we were all going to die in that pile.  I pulled myself out
of the pile.  My slip-ons slipped off.  I stood up and saw nothing.  Not
even
and inch in front of me.  I put my hands out and felt for something.  I
bumped into the brick side of a building.  I bumped into milk crates.  I
stopped. I had no idea what to do, and I knew everyone around me was
suffocating.  I thought about my Mom and dad, they would be so sad to hear
that I died.  I thought about my husband. Just married and I will not get to
live my life with him.  I thought about my brothers.  They would cry.  I
told
myself to just keep trying to find away to air, but I didn't believe I would
live.
I bumped into something that I could feel the top of, so I lifted myself up.
I worried I was going into the back of a dump truck, and I was scared I'd be
trapped.  I didn't know if there was fire, or a bomb.  I didn't know how to
protect myself ??" find air.  Go up? ??" so I didn't know for sure that a
dump
truck would be bad.  I think it was scaffolding.  I think I jumped over
piles
of bodies by climbing scaffolding.
I pulled myself into a building. What building? I don't know.  And I took a
breath.  I took two breaths.  I was sure the building would be bombed.  I
looked for stairs.  I kept thinking I needed clean air.  I found a bathroom.
I didn't realize I wanted water until it was there.  Four men inside. Two
fighting   faucet.  I shared the toilet with another man.  We drank almost
the whole bowl.
Once the four of us were calmed by water and air, we ventured outside the
bathroom.  We walked up stairs. S lowly.  We checked doors behind us, left
them all open.  We got up only one floor.  We waited.  I cried.  They shared
one can of apple juice.
The intercom in the building announced stay where you are.  I was so
relieved
to know people knew we were there.  The intercom announced again and I
thought another bomb would go off and I'd die.  I cried.  The guy with the
apple juice put his arm around me.  I wondered why no one else cried.  The
intercom announced to go down the stairs.  I picked up a wastebasket: I
planned to fill it with water.  Planned to use it to shelter myself from the
next bomb.  (I still had no idea the building collapsed.)
In the lobby of the building someone gave me a Nantucket Nectar and told me
to vomit.  I walked outside the building with the drink in my wastebasket.
There was no one around. White everywhere.  The four of us had nowhere to
go.
  I couldn't remember where I was.  I walked toward the water.  Police
directed very one north.  I asked a woman next to me, "Where are we going?"
She said, "I don't know."  She had no dust.  She looked so steady.  I
followed her.  This was the beginning of her long protection.
She said, "You can walk home with me.  You need a shower."  I coughed.  She
asked why I was carrying a wastebasket.  I said, "In case there's another
bomb."  She held on to my arm as we made our way next to the river.  In
Chinatown, she bought me shoes.  At the Bowery we finally found a pay phone
that didn't have a line of people.  So she called her husband and I sat down
next to my wastebasket.  It was the first time I sat down, and I started
crying.
We resumed walking.  Sometimes we ran.  I made sure to keep up and I didn't
tell Teresa that I was worried that I would faint.  I drank Nantucket Nectar
every time I got dizzy.
At 59th St. a plane went overhead and I screamed.  In front of
Bloomingdales.
  There was no one there from Wall St. I knew I looked crazy.  I screamed
anyway.  I reminded everyone there were no planes allowed to fly.  Someone
said, "It's the army."  I came out from under my wastebasket and kept
walking.  Theresa's apartment was 71st on the Upper West Side. Where
everyone
looked fine.
In the shower, dripping debris down my body, I remembered one more moment
under the rubble.  When I couldn't breathe. When I couldn't see.  In the
middle of the dead quiet was a voice.  He said, "Is there anyone here? Can
someone hold my hand?" I reached out to the voice, and held his hand.  It
was
shaking and the skin was old.  I squeezed and then I let go.

Yes, those are the numbers I have gone by and I have
already done my shopping!!! :-)  Anyway, we really
have to get going on MOm and Dad's gift so I can feel
like I am getting somewhere.  Anyone interested in
taking responsibility for the shopping around????
Speak up now!  Also, did I hear besides shopping for
the kiddie KK, we can/should shop for our
godchildren???  Someone please let me know.

Where should adult KK gifts be sent??  To the couples
home or if they live in NY, to Mom and Dads???

Ben and I got our first tree this year--how exciting!!
 We got it and put it up today.  It looks beautiful if
I do say so myself.  Here is a new list for Ben and I
since Maeve doesn't think it is appropriate for me to
ask for china and things Ben probably doesn't want---
Ben-- a BROWN snap on Tiffany belt (for the silver
buckle)  they will know what you mean.  Dee-maybe your
friend can get this at a discount???  Any Beatles
CD's--  I think one is called Beatles One--  or a
Beatles box set (if there is one)---or camel color
cordeuroy's from POLO (don't know how much they are)
in a 38 X 32--
Now for ME--spode china 5 PPS,  anything from Tiffany
(if you are going there for Ben's gift) again,
Dee-maybe you can get at a discount???-- earrings
(silver balls) or bracelet (silver balls),  tiffany
heart necklace, etc., I also saw at POLO (if you go
there for Ben's gift) a tea pot to go with our
everyday Claire Pattern,  there are these miniature
stand up figures called "The Carolers" (I know Talbots
has some), that I am collecting (department stores may
have them also) about a foot tall--they all look like
they are singing.
Anyway, I hope this gives some more ideas for our
KK's.  Hope you all had a great weekend!  Oh, I have
our address for Colorado (but please send to arrive
after the 16th)
Rogers
114 Bermuda Drive
Edwards, CO  81632
Thanks so much!!  Meg and Ben

After an incredible holiday of travelling and partying, I needed some time
to rest and dry out.  I looked into those fancy resort spas and they were
way to expensive.  And then I thought, what better way to do it then be
stranded on a ship for six months.  I will lose some weight, get in shape,
grow my liver back, and come out a lean, mean fighting machine.  It is day 3
of the six month "cruise" and I don't seem to feel much different?  I hope
they didn't lie to me...

This is my new address as my old PwC address will only be read when I am in
a port.  I hope everyone had blast over the holidays and here is a picture
on New Years of me before I got really out of control.

Today is my last day with the company and with all sincerity, I want to thank 
everyone for making my last 2.5 years so much fun.  It really has been a 
blast and I hope we keep in touch.  As you know, I'll be at Northwestern next 
year so if you're in Chicago, please look me up.  Take care, I wish you guys 
all the best.  Here is my forwarding info, but first...

No Iaia email is complete without a cheesy, Italian quote:
And so I leave you with the immortal words of Francis Albert Sinatra:

"And now, the end is near;
and so I face the final curtin.
I ate it up and spit it out.  
I faced it all and I stood tall;
And did it my way."  

God bless that guy, anyway, here it is:

It's been fun. Y'all take care now, y'hear?

Hey Ben!? I just saw your message from 9/26. I  guess I'm one of those who is 
lazy about checking e-mails {or just not used to  it.}? It has been busy 
around here. The SNCARC dinner was a success, but  I'm glad it is over now.? 
Kara seems to be doing a bit better. I was there  today and we went out for a 
walk. It was good.? I think she has a ways to  go though.? I'm glad to hear 
that you are going to be staying in  Houston.? I'd like to hear more about 
how that all went. Well, I'd better  get dinner started.? Hope you had a good 
weekend.? Love ya!

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and are currently in an Enron contract garage you are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The  Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until fall 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until  Sky Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a an information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.

Happily situated in London trying to recover from the additional lack of sleep
post flight - all I have to say to y'all (no I don't use that turn of phrase 
in
regular conversation) is that I hope you get some more training in prior to 
the
wedding - after all, losing the second half of July to recovering is not
amenable.  Many thanks for the pics Mark - can't wait to see the rest.

If you have not yet had the opportunity to enroll for the 2002 CFA exam, AIMR is pleased to announce that you now can do so electronically through the AIMR Web site at http://www.aimr.org/cfaprogram/index.html.

The next enrollment deadline is 3 December 2001 and, as a reminder, this year AIMR must RECEIVE your enrollment form and payment by the deadline date.

Many CFA candidates have inquired about the status of the New York Society, which had its office in the World Trade Center. We are happy to report that all NYSSA staff escaped safely on 11 September, that the organization is relocating to midtown Manhattan, and that is up and running with a full slate of educational programs. Visit http://www.nyssa.org for information about NYSSA's Fall and Spring continuing education and CFA review courses, and seminars.

Benjamin,

Hopefully, you will get credit or at least some recognition for the
important role you played. But you shouldn't be terribly disappointed if you
don't.  I have found in business that you don't always get credit for the
things that you truly achieved and yet sometimes you get more credit for
things than you believe that you deserved.  The relationship between
contribution and credit is often difficult to predict and sometimes defies
logic.

I believe you stepped in and made a meaningful difference in this deal.

Dad

Thanks for talking to Cyrus for me.  I hope that will be enough to get Dave
and Don to promote me to manager, since I clearly deserve it with this
transaction. I don't think there as been a manager, much less an Associate
(my level)  has done a deal like this and that is exactly what I am going
to tell Don Miller and Dave Delainey.  Our PRC meetings our going on right
now and I trying to get this done right away.  Thanks again for taking the
time to talk to Michael.

Thanks for the message.  I am surprised to have run into you and brandon at
otto's - we never see each other there.  That was a joke.

Great luck with that marathon.  That will be awesome I am sure.  I am signed
up for austin in feb, so I am pretty excited about that one.

Let me know how it goes!  Talk to you later...

Hey Dan:
It was good to see you the other day.  It's funny because I had tried to
send you an e-mail, after talking to Andrew about the paper.  It's great
eveything is going well.  I'm running the NYC Marathon in two weeks so my
weekends are mostly about running, but after that I would like to get
together for some golf.  Talk to you soon.

Hey friends:

As most of you already know, I had left Enron recently to embark on my MBA
program this coming fall. Sorry I don't have the time to visit with all of
you individually to bid farewell, and I would like to take this opportunity
to thank each and everyone of you for all your help and support over the
past 3 years I had been at Enron.

I am currently visiting my family and friends in Singapore, before heading
back to Houston to drive up to Boston. You can reach me at this permanent
email address, or alternatively, the following after 8/23/00:

636 HBS Student Mail Center
Boston, MA 02163-7807
(617) 493-1816
klau@mba.hbs2002.edu

Hope everything is well with all of you. Please keep in touch and take great
care of yourselves!

Best regards.

-Clement


p.s. Look for me if you are going to be in Boston area!

 Well, after this weekend, we can scratch off watching the horns as a major 
activity for Vegas.  It looks like there is going to be around 6-8 of us 
going, myself and a most of the others going Thursday and a few showing up 
Friday. Make sure you get your air ticket soon, the prices are good but 
availability will be running low with a $200 ticket.  I have called on rooms, 
but I haven't gotten the right deal yet.  It will work itself out, it always 
does.  

 For those of you who I haven't heard from, drop me a line.

The time has finally arrived for me to leave the working world - tomorrow 
(7/28) is my last day at Bank United - and I will soon be leaving for 
Evanston, so I thought I'd pass along some info if you need to reach me.

I'll be in Houston until around August 23rd or so.  My home # is (713) 
665-5792.  I can also be reached at the parents' house at (281) 920-3113.  No 
more cell phone for now - drat!  My email address (until I get up to school) 
is: cbmcwherter@yahoo.com .

My contact info in Evanston is:

1600 Hinman, Apt. 1M
Evanston, Illinois 60201

(847) 869-7988


I'll forward my Kellogg e-mail address when I get it in September.  If you 
ever want to come up and check out Chicago, catch a game at Wrigley, or 
donate money to the McWherter Scholarship Fund, please let me know.  I'll be 
more than happy to take a break from the world of academia and do whatever.

I'm sure I'll see most of you before I leave, but if not, take care and I 
wish you the best.

Blake

What the hell happened this weekend?  All I can say right now is thank you
to everybody who showed up and made this weekend one of the most fun
memories ever.  And thanks to Miguel and Blake again for organizing
everything; I couldn't have done it without y'all.  Once I can put more full
sentences together, I'll write more.  Thanks again.

Take a look at this.  I did the numbers questions, the rest look like they 
are going to take a few minutes to do.  I'll check my email tonight, let me 
know where you get to.

Hey there,

How is it going in Texas?  Did you go skiing this year?  Did you get the
message that I called from Hong Kong?  This has been one incredible
adventure.  The workday is long but the time flies.  It is also great to
work with people who are so dedicated and willing to try new things.  We are
now in the Persian Gulf so keep an eye on the news, if anything happens here
we either caused it or are caught in the middle of it.

What does your apartment look like?  I am getting your wedding present from
the Mid East and no, it is not your own pet camel.  That is for me.  I need
to know the colors you like or better yet the colors Megan likes in a rug.
I also need the size you want.  Think of what and where you would put it
when buy a house.  These things last forever and appreciate in value (as
long as you don't have a dog!).

I talked with OB via email and we are both going to try and enter the NYC
marathon this fall.  Are you doing this?  Its Saturday morning on the ship
and it is just like any other work day.  I am going for a 75 minute run.
Talk to you later.

 Congratulations Benjamin C  Rogers !

 You are a 2000 New York City Marathon Lottery winner. Cheers!

 YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS, DON'T YOU??

 You have earned the right to run 26.2 brilliant miles through the streets of 
New York City on Sunday, November 5, 2000! (Only 115 days to go.)

 AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, DON'T YOU??

 It's time to start training!

 Start RIGHT NOW by outfitting yourself with the official "Training for 2000" 
t-shirt! Why train in silence?! Let the world know your goal and wear a 
t-shirt that keeps your training on track.

 AND . . . because today is your lucky day, we have a great deal for you: 
order your "Training For 2000" t-shirt before 11:59pm* on Sunday, July16th, 
and the shirt is your's for the special price of $15 (regularly $18), or the 
Training for 2000 tee shirt and cap for $29.95! (Just note code #332 in the 
shipping instructions, and we will adjust your price!). To check it out, 
please visit the NYC Marathon website at www.nyrrc.org/merchandise.*

 Sincerely,
 Your friends at the New York City Marathon.

 *Hey, wait a minute! 11:59pm! What are you doing AWAKE? Get in bed and get 
some rest! You're a Marathoner in Training!

 **Also, now that your geared up, why not register for an NYRRC race and get 
acclimatized to the racing experience. Run with others, consume water on the 
go (not necessarily as easy as it looks), and start dress rehearsing for the 
big day. For information on our June favorites, visit www.nyrrc.org.
