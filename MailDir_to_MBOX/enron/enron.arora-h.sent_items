All,

The below Analyst & Associate recruiting dates require ENA participation at Manager level at above.   In order to resource each of your departments it is important to have ENA's involvement and participation in the interviews and debrief sessions on Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday events.     These de-brief sessions will allow you the opportunity to select candidates you wish to join your groups.  The target  is to assign potential candidates to business units and departments from the outset.

As ENA has the highest percentage of A&A rotating in its business unit, the participation of ENA at interview should reflect this.     Therefore, please encourage your direct reports and managers to participate in the below events in order to secure candidates for your business area.


Associate Recruiting:		Saturday November 3						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview
Analyst Recruiting:		Friday, November 16						Total - 70 Candidates for Interivew
Associate Recruiting:		Saturday, December 1						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview

The above spreadsheet represents ENA's particpation today which I believe highlights the need for much additional support in these efforts.

Please confirm by return participation of your respective groups.

Regards,

Karen Buckley

FYI -
 
Jennifer Stevenson at Andersen may be calling you all to try and verify something to assist us with our dual trigger accounting arguments.  We have been trying to prove to Andersen that the value in the dual trigger option lies more in the price volatility than the physical plant outage.  AA was perplexed by the approximate 50% margin on these deals.  Larry Marcus pointed out to them that this isn't any different than an out of the money call option which would also typically generate a 50% margin.  They believe that it will greatly help our argument if they can verify with a trader that this is true.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Subject: RE: status of CCO book accounting treatment


if a call option is way out of the money, such as the ones we purchased last summer, the premium is a multiple of the "expected" payout.  a trader may not respond well to the term "margin" because they dont calculate it. as an example, if the midmarket value for a $100 power call is $2.50, and a $500 call is expected to pay 40% as much, a trader would offer this illiquid instrument for $2, which would be like a 50% margin.  one problem with this analogy is that expected value of payout is frequently much lower than the midmarket because there are very few arbitrageurs in this market who can really take advantage of that.  this example does support the statement, but a trader will not think about it the same way.  they will not call this extreme vol smile on illiquid products a high margin.  harry arora would be the trader to talk to.

Patty Grutzmacher and Jennifer Stevenson (both Andersen) were scheduled to review our pricing model with Tom Bauer (Andersen partner) this week.  Due to issues relating to the Enron shareholders' lawsuit,  Tom could not meet with them.   Patty and Jennifer did have further discussions with Amitava and Vasant.   They are all right with the model.
 
Larry - 
Patty / Jennifer want to confirm your statement that a 50% margin on an out-of-the-money call option is not unusual.  They have asked Stacey White (Director of Power Risk Mgmt) to recommend a power trader with whom they can talk.  If you know of a person you would like them to talk with, please let me know.
 
Mary Cilia (transaction support) has asked Jennifer and Patty not to push the issue with Tom Bauer until he is in a more receptive mood.  We are still anticipating a resolution this quarter.   I will continue to keep you informed.

VOM - I think we did $2, Brandon should be able to confirm, I know it was 7x24, with 8 hour min run
Re size - our interest is atmost 250 MW
 
Capacity in the ECAR market is important from a reliability aspect.  For example we could sell totally synthetic tolls and they would not be as valuable as the toll  off a plant in the region. Thats where the capacity comes into play. Moreover as RTOs come in, there might be an explicit ICAP market for ECAR.

Harry:
 
Received your voice mail from last night.  Just to make sure I've got it right: bid is $3.00/Kw-mo; Heat Rate is 7,000.
 
Re: size - do we want 250MW, or more?
Re: VOM - is $2.00/MWh what we have in mind?
Re:  Availability - is it 7x24 or 5x16.
 
Didn't understand the comment on capacity.  If we've got the call, don't we also have the capacity?
 
Thanks,
 
Greg

Tried calling you earlier today but looks like there is something wrong with your phone (x34049).  Unfortunately I will not be able to make it tomorrow , but my colleague Doug Smith (3-9310) who runs our Ercot trading group has agreed to take my spot. 

I told him this was for 2 hours. Can you give me a call and let him know the details. I did give Doug my folder.


Thanks

Brandon and Harry:

Brandon:  I assume the pricing is at the mids.  Also, since the spread between the 1.50VOM and the 3.00VOM is so small, I'll just quote the 1.50.

Harry:  Please look at the entire email thread (to get a sense of all the metrics we're employing for this quote).  ConEd has already announced a 3x7FA peaker configuration for Lakewood, NJ.  The site is already owned by ConEd, part of an existing 230MW combined cycle plant they already own.  It's on the same transmission line (running to the south) as the Oyster Creek nuclear facility, which has a license expiration in 2009.  The existing plant is a non-merchant EWG, selling 215MW to JCP&L pusuant to a twenty-year PPA expiring in 2014.  ConEd has put out an RFP to sell 200-250MW of the peaking capacity from this planned facility.  They planned to have the unit operational by June 2002.  If we provide this synthetic toll, the plant construction would be deferred.  Let me know if we can do 350 to 500MW and let's talk about appropriate spreads above the mids.  Also, please be mindful of their desire for 8 hour mins.

Thanks

Pricing as follows:
For the 3 year option:
$1.50 VOM - $1.77
$3.00 VOM - $1.69

For the 4 year option:
$1.50 VOM - $1.74
$3.00 VOM - $1.66

As always, these prices are indicative.  For a product of that size (350-500MW), I would probe the customer to find a break-even/cost of construction price, and approach Harry to get the risk premium.
Let me know how it works out,

FYI -
 
Jennifer Stevenson at Andersen may be calling you all to try and verify something to assist us with our dual trigger accounting arguments.  We have been trying to prove to Andersen that the value in the dual trigger option lies more in the price volatility than the physical plant outage.  AA was perplexed by the approximate 50% margin on these deals.  Larry Marcus pointed out to them that this isn't any different than an out of the money call option which would also typically generate a 50% margin.  They believe that it will greatly help our argument if they can verify with a trader that this is true.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Subject: RE: status of CCO book accounting treatment


if a call option is way out of the money, such as the ones we purchased last summer, the premium is a multiple of the "expected" payout.  a trader may not respond well to the term "margin" because they dont calculate it. as an example, if the midmarket value for a $100 power call is $2.50, and a $500 call is expected to pay 40% as much, a trader would offer this illiquid instrument for $2, which would be like a 50% margin.  one problem with this analogy is that expected value of payout is frequently much lower than the midmarket because there are very few arbitrageurs in this market who can really take advantage of that.  this example does support the statement, but a trader will not think about it the same way.  they will not call this extreme vol smile on illiquid products a high margin.  harry arora would be the trader to talk to.

Patty Grutzmacher and Jennifer Stevenson (both Andersen) were scheduled to review our pricing model with Tom Bauer (Andersen partner) this week.  Due to issues relating to the Enron shareholders' lawsuit,  Tom could not meet with them.   Patty and Jennifer did have further discussions with Amitava and Vasant.   They are all right with the model.
 
Larry - 
Patty / Jennifer want to confirm your statement that a 50% margin on an out-of-the-money call option is not unusual.  They have asked Stacey White (Director of Power Risk Mgmt) to recommend a power trader with whom they can talk.  If you know of a person you would like them to talk with, please let me know.
 
Mary Cilia (transaction support) has asked Jennifer and Patty not to push the issue with Tom Bauer until he is in a more receptive mood.  We are still anticipating a resolution this quarter.   I will continue to keep you informed.

--------------------------------------------------------------

DEFUNCT "STIMULUS" PACKAGE IS UNCLE SAM'S UNINTENDED GIFT

Uncle Sam sent taxpayers an unexpected gift last week: an economic 
"stimulus" package that never made it off Capitol Hill.

Many economists, critical of the proposed government spending 
increases, have pointed out that the economy had already started to 
show signs of recovery anyway. Other critics correctly point out that 
the "stimulus" had enough pork to keep special-interest groups 
hibernating high on the hog till next winter.

There is, however, another reason to have frowned at Washington's 
"stimulus" proposals and to rejoice at their demise. Government 
"stimulus" packages are not, as environmentalists might say, 
"sustainable." They merely crowd out or postpone increases in private 
investment -- the fuel of economic recovery. And when a government 
"stimulus" is financed by inflation, it tends to undermine the source 
of that fuel: capital formation.

This holiday season we can thank Congress for its inability to agree 
to "help" the economy. But, unfortunately, we're still haunted with 
visions of Christmas past, when bad legislation has gone back to 
conference committees only to be return as even worse legislation.

Too bad Washington, DC, doesn't have a "no returns" policy.

We Stand, United We Fall," by Richard Vedder, senior research fellow 
at The Independent Institute, at

ODE TO JOHN ASHCROFT AND CIVIL LIBERTIES

So long as Americans have freedom of speech, there is hope that the 
flame of liberty will remain lit. In that spirit, we offer the 
following ditty posted on the website of The Nonviolence Web.

    "Ode to John Ashcroft and Civil Liberties"
    (Sung to the tune of "Santa Claus is Coming to Town")

    You better watch out,
    You better not pout,
    You better not cry.
    I'm telling you why.
    John ashcroft's coming to town.

    He sees you with your lawyer.
    He listens to every phone;
    He reads everyone's email,
    and he locks you all alone.

    With little tin guns
    And tiny cellphones
    Rooty hoot, hoot, he's breaking in homes,
    Big Brother is coming to town.

    He knows when you are traveling.
    He knows who you're around;
    Tried in military courtrooms,
    Not a lawyer can be found.

A CHRISTMAS REFLECTION

Christmas, a holiday rooted in both Christianity and pre-Christian 
celebrations of the winter solstice, is also an appropriate time to 
reflect upon the secular values that have helped Western civilization 
over the course of two tumultuous millennia. Among these values: 
freedom of conscience, peace on Earth, and goodwill toward men.

These values transcend any particular religion; they are in fact 
articulated in varying degrees by most of the world's religions. Yet 
they have found their fullest expression in the West. Why?

Because in Western culture more than in any other, the individual counts.

"This empowerment of the individual is unique to Western 
civilization," writes Paul Craig Roberts.

And it is this individualist precept -- respect for the dignity and 
worth of each human life -- that holds the key to understanding the 
unique institutions of the West.

The West's individualism, writes Roberts, "permits an individual 
person to put his or her foot down, to take a stand on principle, to 
become a reformer and take on injustice.... It has made the 
individual a citizen equal in rights to all other citizens, protected 
from tyrannical government by the rule of law and free speech."

Just as freedom in the West has unleashed in the marketplace the 
progressive forces of what one economist termed "creative 
destruction," so freedom in the West has unleashed a similar 
phenomenon in the marketplace of ideas. This perhaps is the West's 
supreme paradox (and achievement) -- its tradition of questioning 
even tradition itself.

Concludes Roberts: "Be we religious or be we not, our celebration of 
Christ's birthday celebrates a religion that made us masters of our 
souls and of our political life on Earth. Such a religion as this is 
worth holding onto even by atheists."

MORE YEAR-END GIVING TIPS -- PLUS A BONUS!

Last week's LIGHTHOUSE item regarding making a year-end contribution 
inadvertently omitted the qualifier *federal* taxes in discussing the 
tax ramifications of gifting stock.  As state and local tax codes can 
have varying provisions, be sure to check these -- and, as always, 
with your own tax adviser -- prior to making a charitable gift 
decision involving stock.

innovative and path-breaking solutions to today's pressing 
challenges.  If you've already made a gift this year, your expanded 
support with an additional year-end bonus contribution will help fuel 
even greater efforts.

You may mail a check dated prior to the end of the year, or call, 
email, or fax us your credit card number and amount of donation you 
wish to make.  For further information on the benefits from various 
Independent Associate Membership levels, please visit the following:

electronic transfer.  Call, fax or e-mail us for easy instructions on 
doing so.

Again, contributions to The Independent Institute are tax-deductible 
to the extent allowable by law, and are used to further efforts to

with your membership of $100 or more, you will receive a FREE copy of

We have completed our evaluation of the two proposed structures (1) May

beginning in 2003.  Unfortunately, based on the prices quoted below, neither

evaluates well enough that we would want to pursue any further.  We

I left a message for Greg, that we'd be prepared to show a 3$ bid if that includes capacity.  I did underline the point that we are not too excited to buy but nevertheless will show an indicative bid.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hi Nik
 
 
This is the nasty side of American business.  There is nothing to be embarassed or discouraged about.  These are hard times and I think your graduation timing is no help either.  People graduating '98 through '00 had it goood.  But hang in there, opportunities are fewer, but they are out there.  You might want to broaden your search into energy and healthcare.
 
Enron is one heck of a story. What a ride !  The only conclusion I have is, next time I see some professor about efficient stock markets, I am going to smack him bad. As hard it is to manage businesses in trouble, it is not easy to manage businesses which are over-valued either. There is huge propensity for management to be complacent and attribute it to themselves, while it might be the investors folly and nothing more.  I have been on the ride up and down and all I can say is you live and you learn.
 
I will look out for opportunities out here. Enron is trying to stay close to core businesses but the energy industry in general is still hiring and complacent. You keep at it bud, and things are going to get better.  This market economy beast can be hard to handle at times but in the end it works out. Say hi to Cindy and Noah.

Harry:
 
I am kind of embarassed to write this mail to you but just wanted to let you know that I was laid off by my firm last week. Although I am really mad at the way I was treated, I am ready to move on. I am not too sure as to what I am going to do as jobs here in this country are pretty rare these days. But we have planned to stay in Boston for a month and failing which we will move with my sister in NJ and stay there for a couple of months and if nothing works out we will go back to Vancouver. Although I am not too sure what I am going to do in Vancouver.
 
But I thought I should share this with you and in case you have any opportunities for people with my skills in mind you can let me know. I know Enron itself has been going through some shaky times at the moment. It seems that suddenly bad news is raining from all directions or pouring is perhaps a right word to describe it.
 
Bye for now and keep in touch.
 
Harnek

We have completed our evaluation of the two proposed structures (1) May

through September and (2) June through August for a three year duration

beginning in 2003.  Unfortunately, based on the prices quoted below, neither

evaluates well enough that we would want to pursue any further.  We

appreciate your interest and remain interested in any future proposals you

Just got off the phone with the customer.  Seems we were sufficiently off the market that they didn't see any upside in stringing us along.  I told them that the indicative price came from our structuring group and that we would now try to tighten things up directly with the desk.  Ergo, we get another shot.  Let's make it a good one.

============================================================
Enron Names Jeff McMahon Chief Financial Officer 

October 24, 2001 16:15:00 (ET)

HOUSTON, Oct 24, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Enron Corp. (ENE </cgi-bin/gx.cgi/AppLogic+ResearchStock?cmenu=DetQ&prod=ENE:US:EQ>, Trade </cgi-bin/gx.cgi/AppLogic+OrderForm?Symbol=ENE>) announced today that it has named Jeff McMahon chief financial officer. McMahon had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron's Industrial Markets group. From 1998 to 2000, McMahon was Enron's treasurer. 
"Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron," said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and CEO. "He has the trust and confidence of our investors and financial institutions." 
Andrew Fastow, previously Enron's CFO, will be on a leave of absence from the company. "In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO," Lay said. 
McMahon, 40, joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations. Upon returning to the United States, McMahon was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp. In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works, where he had responsibility for Enron's e-commerce activities. 
McMahon has a bachelor's degree in business from the University of Richmond in Virginia. He is a Certified Public Accountant, SFA registered and is a member of the American Institute of Public Accountants and Association of Corporate Treasurers.

Hi Darren
 
 
You sure did.  
 
The whole thing going around here just convinces me how the basic economics and business ideas work as they should.  They all loved us for nearly four years - we could not do anything wrong and now they hate everything about us. The investors and the street is silly and stupid.  While one should spend time looking for the next Microsoft, one should spend time looking for the next Enron.
 
As for the future,  I am neutral - we have a fair chance of pulling it through, though there are significant risks. If our strength is the intellectual captial - the traders and marketeres (you never hear the term franchise) - why would they hang out here for too long, the only thing holding them here is availability of capital and the tolerance of that capital to take risk.  Once the capital is gone, its hard to see the traders and deal makers stay. 
 
In the end, its  hard to say we will survive to be the biggest and baddest commodity trading house but we sure did pioneer it.
 
 
Harry

thought that would catch your attention. Just seeing how you are doing and what your view is on Enron cash liquidity these days...5 and 10 yr paper trades worse than junk. Hope you & Nicole are doing alright.

Did this include any ICAP ? Do we have any idea of who is bidding that one ? I think we need to frame a reverse RFP on this one to see if we could get some-one to buy 4.50$ without the congestion.

Here is the feedback ....

they got 12 responses and shortlisted four
We were number 10 or 11 on the list  (our fixed was 3.75, with 1.50 floating and $500 per unit start charge for 5 yrs, 3 - GE LM 6000)
winning bid was over $5 - I am guessing around $5.50
they think their congestion premium should be around $1 

hope to get more information in the near future

thanks

Hi Roy
 
 
Good to hear from you.  I am glad to hear things are going well. This consolidation in the markets and the economy has been quite severe. I can tell you it has not been fun working with a 50 multiple company either as the p/e contracts to 7.  But nevertheless this had been interesting times.  
 
We ramped down DealBench in good time. It was a good decision and precipitated some good thinking. Practically, everyone moved out of ecommerce. Its just crazy when you think how things were 18 months ago. . Power trading has been immensely interesting. I am running the options desk and we have had a decent year.  Energy trading is fascinating and coupled with my macro background from bond trading,it becomes lot of fun.
 
Say hi to Loreli. Do let me have your Hong Kong phone number.
 
 
Harry

Hi Harry,
 
Just wanted to say hi.  I saw Miguel Vasquez lately and I heard from him that you moved back to trading.  Since I left Enron, I've done Telecom banking for a year in Asia with Lehman.   In that group, I've done a lot of valuation and financial analyses.   Deal flow suffered in the telecom industry with the downturn in market conditions.  On my second year at Lehman, I seized the opportunity to do coverage banking, i.e. winning clients in the Philippines and Taiwan.  With this step, I was fortunate to lead an M&A deal in the consumer goods sector.  It also gave me exposure in energy and financial institutions.   Thanks to my Enron background, I actually showed my value added to Lehman in energy.
 
It pays to be a generalist in times like this.  The layoffs in banking has been severe.   I have survived so far a big reduction among people of my level.  Good thing I still got a raise this year as many did not.  I don't know about the long term prospects of investment banking but I am thankful that I have a job.  Recently I caught up with my b-school friends in San Francisco and found out that it is equally bad there. Coincidentally, I caught up with a friend of mine who interviewed with Madhur Dayal who know works with Thomas Weisel in San Francisco.
 
My wife, Loreli, was able to find a job at the South China Morning Post last July.  So far, we are both enjoying Hong Kong.  Long term though, I believe the U.S. makes sense for both of us.  
 
Hope everything is going well with you.  Please let me know if you just happen to be in Hong Kong.
 
Best regards,
 
Roy

Hi Harry,

   The Chemist in Delhi (Kuber Chemist ) has requested for the phone number for New Jersey address. I presume that is required by the courier service in India. He also mentions that the medicines will take about a week to arrive from the date of departure.

There has been just too many rumors flying around here to quote real long term deals.  Give me a day or so to put numbers on long dated deals.

Any idea when you'll get a chance to respond to these questions?  I'd like to get back to my counterparties ASAP.  Understand you're probably very busy.  Just give me an estimate, if you can.

Harry, Iris and Brandon:

Just finished up another call with my counterparty at Dominion.  Here are the opportunities:

1.	GridSouth - (They really want to dump in "CP&L East" - anything we can do to facilitate 	this will better meet customer requirements.

		Capacity:	2003 - 100MW
				2004 - 250MW
				2005 - 570MW for five years

	Will accept day-ahead dispatch.  Really want 8 hour minimum runs w/ 5x16 availability.

		Heat Rate:	7200
		VOM		$2/MWh

2.	Entergy - 

		They want a straight 7x24, 365-day power purchase @ fixed price.

		Capacity:	65MW
		Start Date:	July 2002
		Term:		5 Years
		Price:		$x/MWh

3.	TVA - Peaker

		Really want intra-day call w/4hr notice for 4hr minimum run time.

		Capacity:	Tell me what, if any, we can do.
		Start Date:	June 2004
		Availability:	5x16 June-Aug; Dec-Mar
		Heat Rate:	10,900
		VOM:		$2/MWh

		Let's really try to see if we can do the intra-day.  If absolutely not available for 4hr 		min run time, see if we can do 8hr min.  If this is absolutely not possible, let's try 		to quote day-ahead 8hr min at the very least.

4.	TVA - Combined Cycle

		This one we already quoted at $3.97/KW-mo for 4-year, 5x16 call, beginning 		1/1/03 for 7,000 Heat Rate; $2 VOM.  This was for day-ahead, 16hr min run time.  		Tell me how much the price changes if we reduce min run time from 16hrs to 		8hrs.

Please call me in NY @ 212-715-5953 to discuss, if you have any questions.  Thanks for all your work.  I think we have a real opportunity here, if we can respond positively on a few fronts.

Regards, Greg

Since I will be interviewing on Thursday, I'd like to have Rob Stalford, in my group (he is the option trader) to interview for the Associate / Analyst program on Saturday. Does that work ? Rob is a manager. Could you check for me .

1. Bruce Sukaly did call me and I am having  lunch with him tomorrow.
2. Could you share more of the presentation you have? It is very informative about their thought processes and ideas. It would be nice to gloss through that whole thing (I dont need to keep a copy or anything)

The power prices are not financially settled, they are settled by physical delivery, the gas prices are settled against 'Gas Daily' index. What we will need to also look at is, the contractual provision, for 2003 onwards, when the RTO is expected to kick in.
 
Also, lets look at some other term sheets and make a more robust one. What might be a good idea is to call John Llodra and see if he has any old ones he could mail us.

As you know, following the downgrade, there is total inability for us to trade.  I dont think it makes any sense to put any numbers anywhere.  Give me a call and I would like to chat about various stuff should trade and where the current markets are.

Hi Harry,
 
Just wanted to say hi.  I saw Miguel Vasquez lately and I heard from him that you moved back to trading.  Since I left Enron, I've done Telecom banking for a year in Asia with Lehman.   In that group, I've done a lot of valuation and financial analyses.   Deal flow suffered in the telecom industry with the downturn in market conditions.  On my second year at Lehman, I seized the opportunity to do coverage banking, i.e. winning clients in the Philippines and Taiwan.  With this step, I was fortunate to lead an M&A deal in the consumer goods sector.  It also gave me exposure in energy and financial institutions.   Thanks to my Enron background, I actually showed my value added to Lehman in energy.
 
It pays to be a generalist in times like this.  The layoffs in banking has been severe.   I have survived so far a big reduction among people of my level.  Good thing I still got a raise this year as many did not.  I don't know about the long term prospects of investment banking but I am thankful that I have a job.  Recently I caught up with my b-school friends in San Francisco and found out that it is equally bad there. Coincidentally, I caught up with a friend of mine who interviewed with Madhur Dayal who know works with Thomas Weisel in San Francisco.
 
My wife, Loreli, was able to find a job at the South China Morning Post last July.  So far, we are both enjoying Hong Kong.  Long term though, I believe the U.S. makes sense for both of us.  
 
Hope everything is going well with you.  Please let me know if you just happen to be in Hong Kong.
 
Best regards,
 
Roy

Shaka man

Hope you are having a good time.  Things did indeed move out of control sooner than anyone could have imagined.  Its been one heck of an experience watching the situation and learning about how leadership works and how markets can make you and destroy you.

As to what next, my first idea is to just take time off and chill out for a few weeks and then see what to do next.

Talk to you soon


Harry

I am glad you liked the presentation.

I had a look at the tool-kit - I think it is a good brief description of various products.  I did forward your email to Iris Mack and she might be able to provide you further input on that. She is also available as a resource (as a derivatives specialist) to analyze clients risk and provide solutions.

I would be more than happy to discuss any specific client situations you have and what we could offer to them. Would be happy to sit down and discuss more stuff with you if you are interested.


Harry

Hi Harry,

I heard you speak yesterday at the originator's meeting.  It was rather interesting.  I took the Derivatives 2 course a few weeks ago and they went into the complexities of options trading.  It was cool stuff.  I'd like to know more about options trading and I hope that you can recommend some good sources or books.  I'd appreciate any info you could pass on.  

Also, I'm putting together an "Originator's Toolkit" which consists of the various financial products that the originators and mid marketers could offer to customers.  I'm attaching a list of option based products that I have put together so far.  I'd be grateful if you could take a minute, read through it, and let me know if there are any additional option products that I should include.  I want to make sure the toolkit has as many useful products as possible.

Thanks so much,
Max

What I heard was this was being handled by Exelon guys, so it makes sense.  These guys prefer dealing with old utiliity guys and so we will need to break-in to get access to some of these deals.

Update on Comed. It's unbelievable how unresponsive these guys are.

We spoke to our contact at Comed and he gave us the names of two other contacts at Exelon that would be handling those type of options.  Doug and Maria left messages when I was out of the office.  We have yet to hear back from them.

Hi Kristi

Hope things are going well. I got your email address from Andrea, who also told me you'd moved to Pittsburgh.  Enron implosion is in full progress and I think this week, we will be left with 30% of our original size.  On the gas power and trading, there are numerous groups who are trying to work out other opportunities, but we will have to wait and see.

Keep me posted on what you are upto.



Harry
