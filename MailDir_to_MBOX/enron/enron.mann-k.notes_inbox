I had spoken to Rod Clement, one of our opinions guys, about having a call 
with you, but we hadn't gotten around to scheduling it. What is your 
availability this afternoon? Both Rod and I are available.

>>> <Kay.Mann@enron.com> 06/05/01 06:25AM >>>
Wilson,

We are trying to finalize this transaction by next Tuesday, and I could
really use your help.  I believe you owe me a draft of an opinion letter?
Also, do you have any comments to the draft agreement I sent out last week?

I also need an opinion that the language in the agreement re the Cities
obligation to financially support MDEA is sufficient.

Thank you,

Kay

Will do.  For the moment, the only document that is outstanding is the joint
letter instruction to Citibank regarding the disbursement of the escrow
funds.  I have a template, but I'll go ahead and let them take the lead.

Kay-

Based on the fact that we're almost done with the project, I don't have any 
comments to the S&S breakout contract for our units at Austin.  If you want 
to remove the combined cycle language, I can live with that.  What I hope we 
can keep are the Austin site specific basis conditions and performance 
guarantees (which are currently listed in the contract you sent to me).  Let 
me know if they resist.

Thanks,
Eric

All:

FYI, tomorrow I should receive turbine contracts for the 3 GE 7FAs being sold 
by Site. Please see the e-mail below from Sithe's advisor regarding the 
transaction schedule. Kay and I plan to initially review the contract, and I 
have a technical team (Booth / Rose) ready to review the contracts as well.

>From an accounting / finance perspective, I am interested in how we should 
proceed given the circumstances. Kay and my initial plan is to review the 
contracts from a technical / legal / commercial perspective and submit a 
revised indicative number by Tuesday in consultation with Duran. Between now 
and then, it would be helpful to know from accounting / finance how we should 
proceed given that we are in a bidding situation (with I'm told three other 
bidders). Herman / Rose / Lisa - please let me know your thoughts on this.

Chip - I would like Chris Booth to work with you on putting a draft DASH 
together.

In the meantime, I will forward turbine contracts to everyone as soon as I 
receive them.

Regards,

Ben

Per our conversation today, the turbine contract and LTSA are being sent
via Fed Ex to your office in Houston.

Final bids are due next Tuesday, June 5th via fax to 781-270-0055.  Bids
should include best price and a closing schedule (date by which bidder will
have all internal approvals necessary to enter into a binding agreement
with Seller subject only to consent from GE).

Thanks again for you patience and please call me if you have any questions,

Question:  First of all, Ben is not on the Incumbency Certificate (we have 
Duran, Presto and Tricoli) so can Ben sign the Escrow Agreement?

Second:  If it is okay for Ben to sign this document, would you like me to

In order to expedite the formation of the escrow account, I am attaching the
signature page to the Escrow Agreement, and ask that you obtain three
executed originals.  Once you have obtained the required signature, please
forward the 3 signature pages to Tremaine Wright at Paul Hastings along with
the executed incumbency certificate, which Kathleen has.  Since we have not
seen the final draft of Escrow Agreement, be sure to tell Tremaine to hold
the signature pages in escrow pending further written instruction from you.
Tremaine will deliver the Escrow Agreement, incumbency certificates, fee
letter, and Form W-9 to Citibank as soon as all the documents are in order.
Tremaine's contact information is listed below:

Kay:

Attached are my changes to the Pompano Agreement. I reviewed the last version 
dated 4-19 which was approved internally (copy also attached), and made 
changes back to that draft where I felt appropriate.

The only section I did not add back in was the termination section. From a 
commercial perspective, I think we're better off leaving it out as we then 
have in effect a free option on the site (as a developers agreement is 
required to obtain building permits). 

Please let me know what you think.

 Duke Energy, Environmentalists Strike Deal over California Plant 
 Tom Knudson 

 May. 16, 2001 
 Knight Ridder Tribune Business News - KRTBN 
 Copyright (C) 2001 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World 
Reporter (TM) 

 Days after state regulators gave Duke Energy the go-ahead to expand its Moss 
Landing Power Plant near Monterey Bay last fall, documents show four 
environmental groups made their own deal with the utility giant. The four 
signed an agreement not to "participate in any lawsuit (or) regulatory 
challenge" that might slow or stop the project in exchange for a financial 
concession: $1 million from Duke for environmental "monitoring and research." 

 Balancing power generation and environmental protection always has been 
difficult. But today, as power-starved California scrambles to find and 
permit new energy sources, some fear the Moss Landing agreement shows that 
money can sway even environmentalists -- and tip the scales too far in favor 
of economic development.

 Environmentalists who signed the agreement, though, said that despite their 
concerns about the plant expansion, they had little chance of stopping it, 
especially after it was approved by the California Energy Commission and 
Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board.

 So they took the potentially controversial step: entering into an agreement 
with Duke for financial resources to pay for studies of the plant's impact on 
the marine environment.

 Other environmentalists, though, criticized that approach.

 Duke Energy's efforts to modernize the Moss Landing Power Plant resulted in 
mitigation payments to environmental and other groups, including:

 $7 million to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation to mitigate the plant's use of 
seawater.

 $425,000 to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation over three years to 
monitor heated seawater discharge in the ocean.

 $1 million to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation over five years to 
monitor water quality through a program sponsored by Save Our Shores, the 
Center for Marine Conservation, the Friends of the Sea Otter and the Otter 
Project.

 $100,000 to the Marine Mammal Center to relocate its triage center for 
injured animals onto power plant property.

 $3.4 million to the Moss Landing Chamber of Commerce over 20 years for 
infrastructure improvements in the Moss Landing community.

 $100,000 to design and construct a boardwalk for additional beach access in 
Moss Landing.

 $60,000 for an environmental assessment for a proposed Elkhorn Slough Circle 
Trail. If approved, Duke would provide an additional $250,000 endowment to 
maintain the trail.

 "It is very disheartening," said Carolyn Nielson, a retired teacher who 
along with some other local residents is waging a battle against what they 
consider an environmentally harmful power plant cooling system.

 "These environmental groups have the expertise, the biologists, the 
attorneys," said Nielson, who has taken her case to the State Water Resources 
Control Board. "We could have been much more successful with their help. But 
there wouldn't have been any financial reward in it for them."

 Such criticisms are off-base, according to Warner Chabot, regional director 
for the Center for Marine Conservation, a national environmental group that 
was among those to sign the deal. He said environmentalists got the best deal 
possible in the current energy climate.

 "Look at what's happening with power plant approvals in California right 
now," said Chabot, referring to the state's push to bring new energy sources 
on line.

 The Moss Landing project -- which is scheduled to add 1,060 megawatts in 
2002, enough to serve one million homes -- is a key part of that energy 
expansion plan.

 No money will go to the four environmental groups -- the Center for Marine 
Conservation, along with Save Our Shores, Friends of the Sea Otter and the 
Otter Project. It will be routed, in five yearly installments of $200,000 
each, to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation, a nonprofit organization that 
helps support sanctuary programs, including scientific research.

 Chabot helped found the sanctuary foundation and sits on its board. He said 
the money will be used to monitor the health of Elkhorn Slough, a 
biologically rich estuary that borders the plant and is linked to Monterey 
Bay.

 "Not a dime comes to the Center for Marine Conservation," he said. "Not a 
penny comes to me."

 Duke representatives said the controversy about the arrangement has been 
stirred by a handful of people.

 "It's a million dollars worth of water quality studies," said Duke spokesman 
Tom Williams. "Our whole effort wasn't to try to buy anybody off. It was 
designed to help increase people's comfort level where there wasn't a comfort 
level."

 The $1 million agreement signed in November is part of a package of more 
than $12 million in Duke payments to civil, government and environmental 
groups in connection with the plant modernization.

 The heftiest award -- $7 million to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation, a 
nonprofit environmental organization -- was negotiated by state agencies to 
"mitigate" environmental impacts of the plant.

 Formed in 1982, the slough foundation exists to promote "the wise use and 
conservation of Elkhorn Slough and surrounding wetlands," its Web site says. 
However, some environmentalists say the state-approved mitigation plan is 
inadequate.

 "If you want to say, 'Who did Duke roll with a big chunk of money?' I would 
say they rolled the California Energy Commission and the Regional Water Board 
for the price of mitigation," Chabot said. "The agencies got bought off 
cheap. And the environment got taken to the cleaners."

 Duke's Williams strongly disagreed. Environmental mitigation "must be based 
on science, not on buying anybody off," he said. "That is inappropriate, and 
we would not participate in that.

 "That suggestion is offensive to us. And it should be offensive to any 
environmentalist."

 Bob Haussler, head of the Energy Commission's environmental protection 
office, said the mitigation plan is biologically sound. "We are confident it 
will improve the slough ecosystem," he said.

 Madeline Clark, a local businesswoman and founder of Monterey Parkway -- a 
citizens group that scrutinizes local public works projects -- called the 
recipients of Duke's payments a "shopping list" of government agencies, 
environmental groups and civic organizations. She was particularly critical 
of the $1 million deal with environmental groups.

 "You know what bothers me?" Clark said. "Environmental groups get tons of 
donations. Their purpose is to protect and defend the environment. If a big 
corporation like Duke can come in and buy them off, I have a real problem 
with that."

 Construction began in November on Duke's project to add 1,060 megawatts of 
natural gas-fired electrical capacity to the Moss Landing plant, purchased 
from PG&E in 1998.

 If the expansion is finished next year, as scheduled, it would account for 
more than 30 percent of all new generation in California in 2002.

 "This is a big deal," said Williams, the Duke spokesman. "It will be the 
largest plant in California. If that plant is delayed a month or two, we lose 
the summer of 2002. And that affects not only Duke Energy, but the state of 
California."

 Opponents say it's not the power they oppose, but the plant's cooling 
system, which will pump about 1.2 billion gallons of seawater each day from 
Moss Landing Harbor. Such pumping, they say, will degrade Elkhorn Slough. 
They argue for an alternative cooling system, such as towers that 
re-circulate water.

 "Basically, what that plant will do is take 25 percent of the volume of the 
harbor and slough, run it through a pipe and dump it back into the ocean with 
much of the marine life cooked and dead," said Steve Shimek, executive 
director of the Otter Project.

 For Shimek and other environmentalists, scientific studies commissioned by 
Duke during the permitting process left key questions unanswered about the 
plant's impact on the environment.

 "There was no scientific evidence that would literally point to Duke causing 
harm to the environment," said Vicki Nichols, executive director of Save Our 
Shores. "We felt we didn't have strong standing to sue."

 Instead, the environmentalists began negotiating with Duke for financial 
payments for studies of environmental impacts of the modernization project.

 The process "gave me tremendous pause and great concern," Nichols said. "I 
knew there was going to be some perception that we were doing the wrong 
thing."

 She was right.

 "As far as I'm concerned, with the price-gouging going on by the energy 
wholesalers, they are just receiving stolen goods," said Clark, of the 
citizens group.

 Her skepticism was sharpened by the recent disclosure that Duke Energy 
approached Gov. Gray Davis with a secret deal offering financial concessions 
if the state dropped lawsuits and investigations into the power generator.

 Chabot, with the Center for Marine Conservation, discouraged any comparison 
between the two offers, calling it "grossly unfair and inaccurate."

 Regardless of what was intended with the payments, Nielson said they stain 
the process. "It is so destructive in terms of making everyone cynical," she 
said.

 Shimek took a different view. "We convinced Duke to spend $1 million toward 
monitoring that, frankly, five years from now could very well come back to 
haunt them," he said.

 "Did we do the right thing? I have no idea. Did we try our best? Yes, we 
did."

We have decided to use:  Voyager Development Company, L.L.C. for the new 
Homestead land option.  We had initially planned to use it for an option that 
we let go (Option Agreement never got assigned to Voyager either).  According 
to Greg Krause, the only thing associated with Voyager was an old 
interconnect study request that was paid for and never used.  I feel 
confident that Voyager is "clean" to use.

weekend in Homestead.  She said to put the options in the terminal company, 
not Lauderdale Land, LLC as you had suggested.  Pick one of the other LLCs 
for me and let me know the name.

Thanks.

I talked to Jason and he said we'll still have Lotus Notes and only docs 
30days and younger will be migrated.  You will be able to get to your other 
documents, but it would be good to go ahead and clean off your email as much 
as possible.  Your address book, etc. will be migrated.  I feel so much

On May 1st, iBuyit Payables was activated for all organizations supported b=
y=20
Houston Accounts Payable Processing Center.  Since this transition, over 30=
00=20
invoices have been successfully processed by this on-line tool.  This is an=
=20
exciting step towards transitioning all of Enron to the on-line processing =
of=20
invoices.

Despite this initial success, I want to take this opportunity to address so=
me=20
of the concerns that we have been hearing about this new tool and the=20
processing center.

I sent an invoice to Accounts Payable a while ago, but the vendor still has=
=20
not been paid.
The goal of the Accounts Payable Processing Center is to route the invoice=
=20
through iBuyit Payables for coding and approval within 4 business days of=
=20
receipt of the invoice by Accounts Payable.  As with the introduction of an=
y=20
new process, Accounts Payable is experiencing transition issues and this=20
process time is currently 8 to 10 business days.  Accounts Payable is worki=
ng=20
very hard to overcome these issues, and expects to achieve the normal=20
processing time of 4 business days within the next 9 business days.

When I call the Accounts Payable Call Center, they are unable to locate my=
=20
invoice.
This again is a result of the current backlog.  Between the time that the=
=20
Accounts Payable Processing Center receives an invoice, and the time that t=
he=20
invoice is scanned and entered into iBuyit Payable, it is very difficult to=
=20
locate that invoice.  Once normal processing time is achieved, this=20
=01&blackout=018 period will be no more than 4 business days.  In the meant=
ime, it=20
is critical that invoices are not resubmitted until you are certain that th=
ey=20
have not been received by Accounts Payable.

What can I do to help process my invoices in a more timely manner?
Vendors should submit invoices directly to the Accounts Payable Processing=
=20
Center (PO Box 4734, Houston, TX 77210-4734, ATTN:  Enron AP) and should=20
indicate the company number and name, contact name, and coder=01,s EID. =20
Currently:

*   90% of invoices are received outside of the Accounts Payable Processing=
=20
Center=20
*   On average, invoices received by Accounts Payable are already 37 days=
=20
past due
*   On average, 40% of invoices received by Accounts Payable do not have th=
e=20
correct company number

Submitting invoices directly to Accounts Payable with this information will=
=20
dramatically increase the speed and accuracy of processing.=20

Providing you with efficient, accurate, and friendly service is very=20
important to us.  We appreciate your patience as we work to achieve normal=
=20
processing levels of service.  More importantly, we look forward to working=
=20
with you on future enhancements that will enable iBuyit Payables to play a=
=20
valuable role in your invoice payment activities.
  =20
For invoice payment status please call the AP Call Center at (713) 853-7127=

Enron Golfers:

Hey guys, Sarah Edwards is a friend of a friend's daughter who desperately 
needs help to stay alive and all you duffers out there can help:

The 100 holes for golf for Sarah Edwards will be Monday June 4 at
Sweetwater CC. Sarah needs a lung transplant and
approximately $150,000 of the costs are not covered by insurance or
medicaid.  

For more info on Sarah, visit Sarahssoldiers.com 

Here is how the 100 holes for golf works:

*Free golf at Sweetwater
*You play as many holes as you can (100 is not mandatory)
* We provide your lunch, drinks and snacks
* You get pledges from your friends to play
*pledges may be flat amounts, per hole, per birdie or per eagle

Lets all keep Sarah alive! Can I get some other tentative commitments?

thanks!

Marcelo and John,

As we have discussed before, we need to document that the price we are using 
for the LM6000's for Electrobolt  is "fair market value".     There are 
several third party sales at Enron that may be applicable to help with this 
exercise.    Kay Mann has offered to help with this,  but  to compare 
Electrobolt's LM6000's to the other sales, we need the equipment list for the 
LM6000's---i.e. what attachments are included with these LM 6000's.    

Kay, what do you need to help with this.   Is it a full equipment list, or 
some other equipment summary.    Could you please describe.   I believe 
Marcelo or John Ayres are the most likely to be able to provide the 
information, but am not quite sure what to ask for.      Thanks.    

Mary

Prior to calling him, though, I wanted to e-mail the acknowledgement letter

Let me know when you think you can get to this, and I'll schedule the call

Ben,

I made a minor adjustment to the LOI re: exclusivity.    

 << File: Midway TECO LOI june 1.doc >> 

Policy states that any time we sign up to exclusivity we are supposed to get 
it approved by Mark Metts, Tim Detmering and the CEO of the affected business 
unit.  Seems a little silly in this case, but it can't hurt. (yes, I know we 
didn't do it with the turbine stuff)

The lenders have specifically asked for an original of the Letter Agreement.
If it is really problematic to get another 2 copies signed, I can ask them
again if they will accept a copy.  I appreciate that there are only 2
parties to the document, but the lenders' reasoning is that the Letter
Agreement is a key underlying document and as such, they would expect to
have an original.  Also, our original arrangement was that we would sign 6
originals of each relevant document so that all parties could have
originals.

I know what a pain it is to get documents re-executed and I apologize that
this request has come so late in the day.

Regards
Isabel

Isabel:

ENA signed two originals of the Letter Agreement (as the Letter Agreement
has only two parties).  I kept one for ENA and provided the other to Greg
Lang for PPL by letter dated May 2, 2001.  I still do not have an original
of PPL's signature, but Greg Lang did provide a fax copy.    Is it necessary
for the parties to sign additional copies for non-parties?   I am checking
with ENA on the GE documents.  Thanks.

First, Kay, you are appointed to set an amount we can spend each
week.  I CANNOT SAY NO, and probably Neil is not much better.  The past two
weeks, I have called back to the museum and had them send me two of the more
expensive things $20+ to save for his birthday.  Yesterday, he wanted to
know how much money we had.  I told him $10.00.  His solution:  "Let's put
your $10 with Mom's money and Dad's money, and then we can buy the..."  His
friends in the gift shop are no help as they point out how educational all
this stuff is.  Anyway, it's your money so you should set the limit.  For
his birthday, I bought him the big I Dig for Dinosaur kit and also a
paleontology outfit--vest, pants, shirt.  He had a fit over it.  I now have
to find one of the straw hats he loved, but that went with another outfit.

Also, I cannot describe his "change" except as an explosion.
Formerly, he would run from dinosaur skeleton to skeleton over and over and
not spend much time at each.  Now, he studies each fossil, and he can tell
you the name of every fossil, every everything.  You would be amazed.  He
knows the name of everything there, and if he doesn't know, he gets me to
read about it.  I could not remember all that stuff if my life depended on
it.  He studies the small things--not just the huge skeletons.

Anyway, let me know.  You are going to die when you see him in the
paleontology outfit.  He thought it was about the coolest thing he's ever
seen.

Photo Sessions for Next Pictorial Roster Set for June 19-20, August 14-15

The Houston Bar Association has contracted with a new publisher for
the 2002 edition of the HBA Pictorial Roster, and photography sessions have
been scheduled for members who would like to have a new picture taken for
the Roster -- free of charge.
Any member who would like to have his or her photo taken may come by
the Houston Bar Association office between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:00
p.m. on June 19 or June 20. Another session will be scheduled August 14 and
August 15. There is no charge for the photo, no appointment is necessary,
and the photo sessions will take only a few minutes. The Houston Bar
Association office is located downtown at 1001 Fannin, Suite 1300.
Members may also submit their own photo for the Roster, or use an
existing photo already on file with the HBA.
Legal Directories Publishing Company, Inc. will begin publishing
annual editions of the Pictorial Roster, rather than every two years. The
HBA hopes to have as many current photos as possible in the new Roster, so
please take advantage of this opportunity.

Otherwise, all of your changes were fine.? You can go ahead and have the

Doug, 

Here's the revised CA.? I highlighted the changed terms.? In addition, I 
deleted the prior paragraph 11 which said that the agreement supercedes a 
prior CA. 

I don't know if the InterGen indentity and signatory are the same,? but 
obviously I left that for you to determine.? I expect that the Enron entity 
which will bid will be EPMI, so I used that entity. 

(See attached file: InterGen North America CA may 18.doc) 

I beefed up the definition of confidential information due to the 
complexity of the issues, and I added 6 months to? the term since things 
won't get cranked up for a while. 

I look forward to talking to you at your convenience.? Have a good weekend. 

Kay

Kay - I have asked Dale to get with you and Lisa Bills to arrange a meeting 
in Houston to have a sit down and get this bugger done.  I propose Thursday 
or Friday of next week.  The same would go for ABB.  Let me know what Dale 
has arranged, and what you think of the idea.  The basic concept is to get in 
a room for 1-2 hours, and get this document done.  I'll let you guys decide

Dale - I had just sent Kay a message, and opened up my mail, saw your 
message, and the one from Jim that wants us in Las Vegas next Wed - 
Thursday.  If we can meet in Houston on Friday, I am planning to be there on

I will be in Houston tomorrow, and have a call in to Paul Pippitone (?) and 
Peter Thompson to pin down where we are and what needs to be done.  I will 
try to pull Rose into that meeting as well.

Assuming we don't get everything resolved at that meeting, Bill has suggested 
(appropriately, I think) that we should have a follow-on all-hands meeting 
next week in Houston with GE as well.  Thursday has been proposed.

 <<Blackline of Article XXI of the LV Cogen Agreement for Override
Letter.DOC>>
 Pursuant to our earlier conversation, I have made all of the
changes we discussed to the Lv Cogen Turbine Agreement and  override
letter.  You had asked that I revise Article XXI in the override letter
so that the confidentiality and proprietary provisions would apply to
ENA as agent.  To do so I have had to make revisions throughout the
Article and, as a result, intend to include it as an annex to the
override letter.  What I have done is to make any reference to "party"
or "parties" (other than references to "third party") be deemed to
include a reference to "Agent".  You will be able to see my other
changes to Article XXI in the attached blackline.  They are just
conforming changes.  Let me know what you think.

Kay, I called Cingular to see what was up with your bill.  The last payment 
was made the end of March.  Your credit card expired March, 2001.  So, you 
are not set up currently for your credit card to be charged.  I'm going to go 
ahead and expense this charge and then you'll need to pay it.  If you want it 
set up again on your credit card, you have to send Cingular a letter stating 
your wishes.

I also changed your address to this building while I had her on the phone.

Is all of this ok with you?>

John/Karen:

It does seem that in general we should have Keith Dodson or Brian Stanley 
sign to evidence approval "closer to home" prior to a signature at the 
Wholesale Group head level.  I don't think it is essential on this relatively 
clear decision, but in general it would make sense to have an EEOS signature .

Concerning the IRR's, John, the IRR on EPC 63 was 25.3%, on EPC 64 it was 
55.1% and combined the IRR was 35.2%.  These will vary with any minor 
adjustments prior to closing.  

Incidentally, the IRR on Demar will be 22.7% for EPC 4 and 25.5% with EPC 4 
and EPC 4350 combined.

Regards,

Chip

I have looked at this and talked to Randy. Besides wondering whether Keith

if I should sign this or if you intend to add Keith or Brian.

 Has anyone calculated the rate or return on the project if this pans out? I

Depending upon the route we take for approval (turbine purchase vs. project 
approval), the DASH process should take no more than 5 to 10 days.  How firm 
are we on the Midway project?

I think Ben's time frame is realistic. I assume we will enter into an 
assignment and assumption agreement with Sithe, to which GE will consent. In 
addition, we may need an override letter to the turbine contract to address 
the E-Next/accounting issues. GE is familiar with what we need in for E-Next, 
which should help expedite matters.

I've been told that we need to resubmit a non-binding expression of interest 
by Tuesday. Previously, we submitted a one page non-binding letter indicating 
that the FMV of the units is $44 MM each. You raise a good point in that we 
should be prepared to say (again, on a non-binding basis) how long we will 
need to close (in addition to increasing the bid on the units). I think if 
our number is good, 30 - 45 days for documentation and close would work, but 
I think we should also be willing to post some non-refundable $s within say, 
2 weeks on the basis of an exclusivity agreement with Sithe. 

The group's thoughts on this would be appreciated.

Thanks.

What is expected for the Tuesday bid? I would guess the most critical from a 
timing perspective will be a response centered on price and 
commercial/technical issues. Michael indicates below he would like a 
timetable for internal approvals to a closing. Do we have any indication how 
pressed he is to close and fund versus agreeing on economic terms quickly and 
allowing us to review the form of contract to ensure compliance with 
accounting and finance guidlelines along the lines of our discussion earlier 
this week? Thanks.

Per our conversation today, the turbine contract and LTSA are being sent
via Fed Ex to your office in Houston.

Final bids are due next Tuesday, June 5th via fax to 781-270-0055.  Bids
should include best price and a closing schedule (date by which bidder will
have all internal approvals necessary to enter into a binding agreement
with Seller subject only to consent from GE).

Meeting of Insurance Law Section
Four Seasons Hotel - Austin
Room: San Jacinto West
June 14, 2001

The Insurance Law Section would like to personally invite you to attend the 
Insurance Law Section meeting and the free CLE which will be presented next 
Thursday, June 14, 2001 at the State Bar convention in Austin.

On June 14, 2001, the Insurance Law Section will hold its annual meeting and 
sponsor its annual 3 hour CLE program at the Four Season's Hotel. As usual, 
Council members and Committee chairs will be elected  by the Section members  
at the annual meeting. The schedule for the meeting and the CLE program is 
set out below. We hope that you can attend the annual meeting and the CLE 
presentations.

1:30 PM to 2:00 PM - - annual section meeting and election of Council members

2:00 PM to 5:00 PM  FREE   CLE program


2 p.m. - 3 p.m.
Insurance Declaratory Judgment Actions
Topic: This panel will consider declaratory judgment actions regarding 
insurance coverage. When should they be filed? Who should file them? What 
discovery is necessary and appropriate? Can they usually be resolved by 
summary judgment? How should these cases be tried? What is the proper role of 
the expert? What is the proper role of the jury? What are the appellate 
twists?

Comment: The Supreme Court of Texas has repeatedly suggested that insurers 
and insureds alike put this procedural device to more use.

Panelists:
Mike Huddleston
Karen Keltz
Rusty McMains
Claudia Volaire
Beth Bradley
Stephen Walraven

3 p.m.- 4 p.m.

When Negligence Blindly Assists Deliberateness

Topic: Suppose Mr. Sleeze Ball sets out to kill his business partner, Cheese 
Square. Suppose further that Mrs. Ball helps Sleeze in various ways which 
turn out to be necessary. Suppose further that Mrs. Ball does not realize 
what Sleeze is up to and does not foresee the consequences of her actions. 
Finally, suppose Sleeze is convicted of murder and then a wrongful death 
action is brought by Cheesey's family (Swiss, Cheddar, and the rest) against 
both Mr. and Mrs. Ball, and their dog Astral. Naturally the Balls have 
homeowner's coverage and Mrs. Ball wants a defense. Question: Should she get 
it?

Comment: This is a burning issue in contemporary liability insurance law, and 
a great deal turns on it. Plaintiff's personal injuries lawyers take note.

Debaters:
Michael Sean Quinn - Affirmative
Christopher Martin - Negative

4 p.m. - 5:00 p.m.

Insurance Defense Guidelines

Topic: Many liability insurers have attempted to issue guidelines and rules 
to govern the ways in which defense lawyers may conduct defenses. Often, if 
the activities of defense counsel do not conform to these guidelines defense 
counsel do not get paid. Recently the Texas legislature outlawed these 
guidelines, or at least some of them. Is this law a good idea, or a bad one? 
Will it be effective? Will it be enforced? Is it really in the interest of 
insureds who are defendants in law suits or is it designed to help lawyers?

Panelists:
Charles Levy
Roland Leon
Clark Richards

Format: Audience participation on all of these topics is welcomed.
It is positively encouraged, not that it could be stopped anyway.

We hope to see you there next week.

Would you have a look in the contracts database to see what we have with 
Exxon/Mobil.  I am hopeful that we have a Master Agreement to do power deals

The lenders have specifically asked for an original of the Letter Agreement.
If it is really problematic to get another 2 copies signed, I can ask them
again if they will accept a copy.  I appreciate that there are only 2
parties to the document, but the lenders' reasoning is that the Letter
Agreement is a key underlying document and as such, they would expect to
have an original.  Also, our original arrangement was that we would sign 6
originals of each relevant document so that all parties could have
originals.

I know what a pain it is to get documents re-executed and I apologize that
this request has come so late in the day.

Regards
Isabel

Isabel:

ENA signed two originals of the Letter Agreement (as the Letter Agreement
has only two parties).  I kept one for ENA and provided the other to Greg
Lang for PPL by letter dated May 2, 2001.  I still do not have an original
of PPL's signature, but Greg Lang did provide a fax copy.    Is it necessary
for the parties to sign additional copies for non-parties?   I am checking
with ENA on the GE documents.  Thanks.

    Pursuant to your request, attached please find a clean copy of the
most recent draft of the LV Cogen Turbine Agreement (second document
below), as well as a blackline (first document below) showing changes to
the draft circulated on April 24.  This version contains Lisa and
Roseann's comments (but for changes to Purchase Amount, Maximum
Liability Amount, etc.) as well as your comment to allocate the payments
among the 4 Units equally. I have not received confirmation as to
whether the April 21 payment was ever made.  I have therefore left it in
bold.  If it has, we can amend the table and reduce the Purchase Amount
accordingly.  In addition, I have assumed that if there is a Change
Order applicable to less than all 4 Units, that the Change Order would
specify how future payments are to be allocated.  To complete the
agreement, we will need to insert the date of execution and Exhibit H-2.

 I have not distributed this to anyone else.  I would be happy to
do so if you desire.

A thought.  As it appears that SW is insistent that the generator has been a 
total loss from the beginning, and that the surveyor/adjuster are not 
convinced of that, would you want to hire and outside expert to give an 
opinion?  I'm sure with the help of Jim Sutherland we can come up with a 
panel of experts for you to pick from to make an independent exam on our

Lynn:

Thanks for the e-mail. If Chuck's CA has been executed and returned to you,
then I would assume you can go ahead and send him the drawings. I
understand that if Sharon wants the drawings, she will have to sign a
seperate CA. Sending the drawings to Chuck, covered by his executed CA,
will certainly speed up the process. Let me know if you have any
objections.

Thanks,

Read your notes re scheduling a call w/ or w/o GE.  From John's and my 
perspective, it seems that we should first have an internal call re the 
consolidation of our assignments from weeks past  into Peter's draft contract 
and then send to GE for their review and follow up call either later this 
week or next.  Steve Swift is OK with this approach.  

At the moment we seem to be knee deep w/GE and Owner on Arcos and suspect 
that 9:30 CST (3:30 London time) will be difficult for us to call in.  
Instead, 1:30 CST would work better for us.  

If this works for the Houston gang could you let us know soonest and we will 
let Mike and Steve know as well.

Would you all be in a posiotion to get together tomorrow morning at 9:30 am

of this process with GE.  We immediately need to start the drafting of the 
Longview turbine contract and I'd like to see if we are close enough to get 
that started.  Scott, today the extension to the Agreement in Principle 
expires and we need to extend.  Can you tee this up with Steve Swift?  Our

let them know we will call them later this week or we'll talk next Wednesday, 
but I would like to get through whatever we need to in order to get the

I've talked to John Schwartzenburg about this and he is available tomorrow 
morning.

Does the first option need to expire or can we terminate prior to expiration 
and concurrent with execution of a new option agreement?  I got a call from 
the owner of Certosa Holdings pleading for help on reimbursement of those 
legal fees.   If we are going to pay a flat fee and renegotiate this 
agreement, I think we need to do so quickly.   Regardless, I need to tell 
them something soon.  They are getting desparate.  I've a call in to Taffy 
Milligan. AEW's assistant to locate the Shutts & Bowen invoice.  

I understand we have engaged Shutts & Bowen in Tallahassee to review some 
property tax issue.  Cound this be an avenue to avoid this on balance sheet

Unless the first option expires (and the original premium is expensed), you 
add the original payment to the renewal premium to determine the percentage.  
If we can't beat the percentage game, we can have the land on the balance 
sheet and that won't put the entire project on it.  Don't ask me to splain 
that, because I can't.  If the land is going to be on the balance sheet, you 
would think that it would be better to have $1.3 on than $4.2.  However, one 
thing I don't know (haven't asked) is what the environmental restrictions are 
with our financing vehicle.  I don't know if the land has to be clean before 
it can go into the vehicle.  I can ask.  If it is required to be clean, then 
you may be back to the $4.2 anyway.

Subject: RE: AEW's backup

Yes we do want to renew the option through September of next year and we will 
need to persuade them to lower the option premium.  Her is a thought:  the 
land fill closure cost is approximately $2.9 million.  Could we create a new 
option agreement that states that the strike price is $4.2 million ($1.3 the 
original strike price plus the cost of land fill closure cost) so we could 
pay an option premium of up to $210,000 (5% of $4.2 million).  At closing, we 
reduce the purchase price by the costs yet to be incurred in the closing the 
land fill.  Since Certosa Holdings will not start the closure until they are 
assured that we will exercise the option if even then, the net cost to us 
would drop back to  the original strike price.  Could we get this past the 
accountants?

Only the memorandum of option was recorded.

I've skimmed it.  I see that the option expires August 9th.  Are we planning 
to renew it?  If so maybe we can renew early and fix what we can to preserve 
some optionality (no pun intended) and cover the fee issue.  Might take too 
long to address the immediate issue.

I don't see anyway we can get around the balance sheet issue unless we let 
the option expire and then reoption, but in that case the option payment 
would have to be smaller (acct says an option of 5% creates a problem as it 
would be considered a down payment).  Just fyi.

Kathleen, was the option recorded, or just a memo of option, or neither?  I'm 
just wondering what is public info.

Herman is out of the office today, but I can discuss the fee issue to get his 
vote.  

More to come...

I think the invoice was for between $20,000 and $30,000, but I can't 
remember.  AEW has the invoice.  This probably will not be the final as we 
will need to work with them in discussions with DERM on delaying the landfill 
closure and in moving jurisdiction of the project from CZAB to the County 
Commissioners.   I think Shutts & Bowen (who may get stiffed by their client 
if this deal blows up) and Certosa Holdings would be open to any suggestions 
and we need to renegotiate the option anyway.  Shall I call and suggest this 
this flat fee for retooling the option agreement to them or shall we do it 
together?  I,m not sure I could explain to them acequately the idiosyncrasies 
of our accounting requirements.

How much is it and should this be the final amount?  One thought I have is 
that maybe we can retool the option agreement so that we pay them a flat fee, 
which is enough to cover the expenditures.  Don't know if this works, but it 
is one thought.  What do you think?

One more thing on the SDEC project:  According to the option agreement we 
executed last October, we agreed to reimburse Certosa Holdings for actual 
third party costs that they incurred in support of our necessary 
applications, submittals and in seeking local approval.  Several weeks ago, 
we recieved an invoice from Shutts & Bowen, attorney for Certosa Holdings 
requesting reimbursement pursuant to the contract.  I forwarded this invoice 
on th Ann Elizabeth not necessarily to pay for but to review considering this 
whole soft cost hard cost discussion.  I recieved another call this morning

good English.  Monika's isn't bad.  Marlena may get flustered and hang up on 
you.

Best of luck at Deerfield and hope to see Pompano on track when I get back in 
the office on June 11th.  Kay is planning on going to Florida on June 12 for 
the moratorium hearing and the rezoning hearing.

Did y'all happen to see the article today about Montana in the Journal? I 
think we need to ask for more money for the D5A. Chris / Carlos - I'd like to 
talk to you before we talk to Montana tomorrow.

Kay,

I have attached the lien release letter that GE has submitted, please let me 
know if this is okay.  If it is okay, and once we receive the LC, we can then 
wire GE the $1,502,355 that was withheld from the last invoice.

Thanks,

Chris

I just received bank comments on the above.  Please call if you have any

Aaron,

Please make sure that the revisions properly reflect the business deal and 
contemplate the amendments that were just executed (so they will be the 3rd 
and 2nd amendments to the PDA and SPA, respectively).  I am officially out of 
the legal business on Monday of next week but will likely be asked by Kay for 
my sign off.

Stuart

Audrey,

Ben and I have reached an agreement which will be documented as follows:

1)  Extension of Dates -- May  11 becomes May 9 (Wed)

2)  Ben will edit the latest version of the Amendment #2 so that

a) on Aug 1, we pay the greater of the $1.5MM ($2.5 less $1 paid at
exercise) and the Additional Compensation (less the $1 MM)

b)  a separate agreement whereby Corp guarantees the payment on Aug 1.

The intention is to sign the Amendment #3 before 5/9.

Thanks everyone for making this happen.

Steve Hase

I tried to RSVP for Skidd.  When I looked to see if it worked, I had instead 
revised my RSVP.  David and I are still coming, but
Skidd is a "maybe."  I am not much of a computer geek, just a regular geek.

Are you doing anything this weekend?  I want to go back to my builder's show 
house and take pictures.  It is wonderful.

Any chance you might be available to get together with Eileen for lunch in 
the next week or two?

Kay,

I like the changes to the Option Agreement, but do not really like the form 
of Memorandum of Option as it is not consistent with the form of Memorandum 
we have used in the past and in my opinion is deficient for recording 
purposes.  Please check out the one attached, which is the form we have 
typically used for our prior Options (subject to minor changes according to 
each state's recording requirements):

I have revised the option form consistent (except where noted) with comments

dealt with your comment regarding the defn of Optionee by tinkering a little 
with the 1st paragraph.  I also construed your comment regarding Enron's 
right to terminate the option to NOT preclude termination if our counterparty 
is in default.  Please confirm that this is acceptable.

Lisa, I did not change the notice info since the first entity will the the 
project co, with ENA Legal receiving a copy.

It's certainly an alternative.  It might be prudent to hold off on the 
decision until we all meet with the adjuster and see if it is necessary based 
upon what she tell us about her position on the claim.  If we are still at an 
impasse and there is no open option against SWPC, then we can always have 
another expert of our choosing present when the next inspection takes place.

A thought.  As it appears that SW is insistent that the generator has been a 
total loss from the beginning, and that the surveyor/adjuster are not 
convinced of that, would you want to hire and outside expert to give an 
opinion?  I'm sure with the help of Jim Sutherland we can come up with a 
panel of experts for you to pick from to make an independent exam on our 
behalf.  Do you want me to pursue this?

Kay:

I talked with Steve today about the Blue Dog deal. I told him we needed the 
consent executed by the end of next week at the latest, and that Chris would 
send him Northwestern's annual report and 10-k.

Steve's only questions centered around the ENA payment guarantee and 
Northwestern's guarantee. He needs to understand from a legal perspective how 
these will be provided to GE (i.e. if both ENA and NW will issue stand alone 
guarantees). I told him that ENA will guarantee the remaining currently 
scheduled payment obligations under the contract. He is also awaiting receipt 
of the letter you're putting together.

Please let me know how we should proceed.

Regards,

Ben

My prior email was written before I read this and it seems like everyone is 
geared up for the call with GE tomorrow.  I'm OK with proceeding if everyone 
thinks we can resolve some stuff.

		 Subject: World Hunger Rev 4a- JR

  I took several assignments from the last World Hunger call.  Status as 
follows:

a.   Tax language-  I have sent a prior version of Rev 4 jr to Matt G asking 
him to call me to let me know when he can talk with GE tax rep.  Steve Swifit 
and I are in London and would like to sit in on that call.

b.   Insurance Language review.   I sent same version to David Marshall and 
Paul Parrish asking for their reviews and opinion as to whether 7FA's are new 
technology.

c.   I "volunteered" to look at the termination language in world hunger, GE 
had some problems, and I had the same problem with the ARCOs contract.   I 
drafted a fix last Friday, sent to Kay M for comment.  I have included my 
suggested changes in the attached redline.  I have forwarded same fix to GE 
at end Friday for Arcos.    I have asked Kay if she still has a concern with 
the Limit of Liability as it relates to termination.  I think it works.

d.  I "volunteered" to work over Article 10, Exhibit B-3 and Exhibit B-6 in 
relation to Guarantees and liquidated damages.  I have done that in the 
attached redline of the T&C and Exhibits.

e. Some time ago I volunteered to resurrect the language associated with the 
reduction in the LD refund in Section 10.9.8.   I had sent out a couple weeks 
ago but received no reaction.    I have entered that fix in the attached 
redline.

f.  I have made several minor changes to definitions associated with 
performance.

Attached is Rev4-JR version of GE T&C's and Exhibits for world hunger.  They 
start from the clean rev 4 version of the T&Cs that Peter forwarded to me at 
my request.  The attached are redlined to show my changes.

I have not sent any of this to GE except for the termination language fix.   
I suggest that the Enron team give these a quick read before the World hunger 
call.  I can print same here and share with GE during the call unless there 
is an objection.  

I hope this will help to advance the process.  My earlier emails to Paul and 
Matt were not intended confuse the situation with different drafts.  Please 
ignore those and for the above purposes use the attached files.


Kay- I suggest that you forward to others who you feel appropriate for the 
purposes of the world hunger call on Wednesday.

I spoke to Tom Loberg of Montana Power today regarding the status of our 
discussions on the D5A. He advised me that part of their merger deal with 
Northwestern Corp required that projects such as the one contemplated for the 
D5A required the approval of Northwestern's board. Montana presented the 
project to Northwestern's board today, but the board declined to grant such 
approval. Tom declined to provide me any further insight.

We will of course immediately begin to pursue other sales opportunities for 
this turbine. FYI, our exclusivity agreement with Northwestern expires 
tomorrow.

Regards,

Ben

Have just talked with adjuster again, and she has preliminary verbal report 
from surveyor who says that drawings merely confirm his prior contention that 
this generator was NOT a total loss at the time of the loss, but that further 
inspection of the unit would be necessary to prove otherwise.  

The comments from Andrew Edison about pressing SWPC on their responsibilities 
and ownership of the unit, this has previously been expressed by the adjuster 
to Jim Bouillion.  She definitely would like to have a sit down meeting with 
Enron people only, not SWPC at this time,  to discuss options and where we go 
from here.  She still hasn't signed the CA, but that is not necessary as she 
is not looking at the drawings and looking at them by her is not necessary 
for the purpose of a meeting with Enron.  

I did not check her availability for a meeting at this time because my 
schedule for Mon-Tues is still up in the air, and Jim Bouillion has a Mon-Wed 
meeting with our captive insurer in Vermont and would not be available before 
Thursday.  Do we collectively want to go forward with the sit down meeting 
with the adjuster, and if yes, who all needs to be involved and what are 
their availabilities?

Concerning the VALUE of the generator, the declared value of the entire 
shipment was $24,506,000.  There is no breakdown on the paperwork I have (or 
the broker) that puts a separate value on just the generator.  Thus I guess 
someone either has that or SWPC can provide that information.  The policy is 
not a "replacement cost value"  policy nor an "actual cash value" policy, but 
a "valued" policy.  What that means is we get paid what ever we declared the 
value to be CIF + 10%.  Hence the need to know what part of the $24,506,000 
is the "value" of the generator.

I await further instructions as to how you want to proceed.

Marchris,

I am getting ready to request a wire transfer in the amount of $7,500 to be 
paid to Albert Lorenzo with Quantum Results, Inc. in connection with the 
Consulting  Services Agreement we have with him.

Please advise if your department has already taken care of this payment 
and/or confirm that you want me to take care of this payment.

Thank you.

Kathleen

Subject: Consulting Agreements with lobbyists
Importance: High

As you know, in the last few months we have had discussions regarding the 
retention of lobbyists to perform services on our Florida Power Development 
Projects.  It was decided that we would have the lobbyists retained through 
the Government Affairs group.  Two recent agreements, one with Quantum 
Results and another with Tripp, Scott, provided for payments to be made at 
certain junctures of our development process.  It has come to our attention 
that these payments were not timely made.   In order to make sure that we 
don't inadvertently miss any future payments, I am proposing that:

1.  We continue to retain the consultants through execution of a consulting 
services agreement signed by Government Affairs.  The consulting agreements 
will be prepared in duplicate originals so that the lobbyist keeps one copy 
and Enron keeps one copy.

2.  Legal will retain Enron's executed original and provide it to Kay Young, 
who maintains a database of all consulting agreements and confidentiality 
agreements entered into by ENA entities.

3.  Legal will distribute a copy of the executed document to government 
affairs for their records.

4.  Legal will distribute a copy of the executed document to Kathleen 
Carnahan who will set up a payment schedule.  Unlike our real property option 
agreements that have a date certain for payment, these agreements often have 
payment schedules dependent upon some approval process.  Thus, it will be 
important for all of us to keep Kathleen in the loop as to dates of hearings 
or approvals so that she will know if it is time for a payment.

5.  Kathleen will provide notices to government affairs that a payment is 
due, and the amount of the payment and arrange for reimbursement of such 
payment out of the development group's RC.

6.  Government affairs will make the payments and be reimbursed out of the 
development group's RC.  

Please advise if this system will work for you so that we can undertake to 
have Kathleen begin setting up a payment schedule.

My strong preference is that we continue to keep things flowing through the 
government affairs group so that we consistently maintain the lobbyist 
relationship.  However, this will require government affairs have some way of 
monitoring the agreements.  I think we fix that problem with having Kathleen 
keep a consultant schedule just as she keeps an option schedule.

I'm going on vacation as of next Wednesday so your response by Tuesday will 
be greatly appreciated.

Please see additional comments in Section 2.4 of the Declaration of 
Covenants.  
I missed this until this morning but the number of votes per parcel does not 
account for the propety to be conveyed by deed to the POA.  This includes the 
road, the drainage ditches and the pond.  Parcel 1,should lose between 2 and 
3 acres, Parcel 2 would lose about 1 acre and Parcel 3 would lose about 10 
acres.  

The decision not give Parcel 3 voting rights or cause Parcel 3 to be assessed 
was negotiated and agreed to by Enron and Cooney Midway Groves.  However, 
since having this property dedicated as the open lands in perputity to meet 
the requirements of the entire 117 acre PNRD, perhaps the POA should be 
oblicated to pay any costs associated with this land: property taxes, 
insurance, maintenance etc.  The only thing we could do with this land is 
lease it out for grazing, which may allow us to keep an ag exemption.

it could be a celebratory drink.  I told Ric I may come by for a drink, but I

Theresa,

Here is a breakdown of the funds flow:



Citibank, as escrow agent, will be wiring funds on Wednesday into the 
following Enron account:

Citibank, NY
ABA 021000089

Account Number
40781075

GE is paid directly from escrow.  We will have to ensure E-Next receives

I've been told that we need to resubmit a non-binding expression of interest 
by Tuesday. Previously, we submitted a one page non-binding letter indicating 
that the FMV of the units is $44 MM each. You raise a good point in that we 
should be prepared to say (again, on a non-binding basis) how long we will 
need to close (in addition to increasing the bid on the units). I think if 
our number is good, 30 - 45 days for documentation and close would work, but 
I think we should also be willing to post some non-refundable $s within say, 
2 weeks on the basis of an exclusivity agreement with Sithe. 

The group's thoughts on this would be appreciated.

Thanks.

What is expected for the Tuesday bid? I would guess the most critical from a 
timing perspective will be a response centered on price and 
commercial/technical issues. Michael indicates below he would like a 
timetable for internal approvals to a closing. Do we have any indication how 
pressed he is to close and fund versus agreeing on economic terms quickly and 
allowing us to review the form of contract to ensure compliance with 
accounting and finance guidlelines along the lines of our discussion earlier 
this week? Thanks.

All:

FYI, tomorrow I should receive turbine contracts for the 3 GE 7FAs being sold 
by Site. Please see the e-mail below from Sithe's advisor regarding the 
transaction schedule. Kay and I plan to initially review the contract, and I 
have a technical team (Booth / Rose) ready to review the contracts as well.

>From an accounting / finance perspective, I am interested in how we should 
proceed given the circumstances. Kay and my initial plan is to review the 
contracts from a technical / legal / commercial perspective and submit a 
revised indicative number by Tuesday in consultation with Duran. Between now 
and then, it would be helpful to know from accounting / finance how we should 
proceed given that we are in a bidding situation (with I'm told three other 
bidders). Herman / Rose / Lisa - please let me know your thoughts on this.

Chip - I would like Chris Booth to work with you on putting a draft DASH 
together.

In the meantime, I will forward turbine contracts to everyone as soon as I 
receive them.

Regards,

Ben

Per our conversation today, the turbine contract and LTSA are being sent
via Fed Ex to your office in Houston.

Final bids are due next Tuesday, June 5th via fax to 781-270-0055.  Bids
should include best price and a closing schedule (date by which bidder will
have all internal approvals necessary to enter into a binding agreement
with Seller subject only to consent from GE).

Thanks again for you patience and please call me if you have any questions,

Michael

Thanks for the update.  If you e-mail me the signature page (eliminating the
page number), I can work to obtain ENA's signatures while you finalize the
document.  In addition, do you want me to forward ENA's incumbency
certificate to your attention for delivery to Citibank?  It might be easier
if all documents associated with the escrow account (incumbency
certificates, fee letter and Form W-9) are delivered to Citibank by one
party.  Let me know.

I heard from Citibank and in addition to making reference to the letter

As for the number of signature pages, three sounds good to me.

Regarding the Escrow Agreement, I reviewed the revised Agreement that was 
e-mailed to us on May 30 by Marisa and confirmed that she made the 
appropriate changes regarding Northwestern Generation I, LLC being the 
depositor of the escrowed funds and would pay the escrow fees, investment 
transaction fees and reimbursements for expenses made by Escrow Agent...

Kay:

The Escrow Agreement that is attached appears to be in final form and
contains all of the changes that we requested.  As a result, will you
overnight the sig pages and the incumbency certificate to Tremaine Wright?
If you prefer, you can courier the documents to my attention, and I can
coordinate getting them to Paul Hastings.  Tremaine needs 3 sig pages and 1
incumbency certificate.  Thanks.

Regards,

Marisa

What is expected for the Tuesday bid? I would guess the most critical from a 
timing perspective will be a response centered on price and 
commercial/technical issues. Michael indicates below he would like a 
timetable for internal approvals to a closing. Do we have any indication how 
pressed he is to close and fund versus agreeing on economic terms quickly and 
allowing us to review the form of contract to ensure compliance with 
accounting and finance guidlelines along the lines of our discussion earlier 
this week? Thanks.

All:

FYI, tomorrow I should receive turbine contracts for the 3 GE 7FAs being sold 
by Site. Please see the e-mail below from Sithe's advisor regarding the 
transaction schedule. Kay and I plan to initially review the contract, and I 
have a technical team (Booth / Rose) ready to review the contracts as well.

>From an accounting / finance perspective, I am interested in how we should 
proceed given the circumstances. Kay and my initial plan is to review the 
contracts from a technical / legal / commercial perspective and submit a 
revised indicative number by Tuesday in consultation with Duran. Between now 
and then, it would be helpful to know from accounting / finance how we should 
proceed given that we are in a bidding situation (with I'm told three other 
bidders). Herman / Rose / Lisa - please let me know your thoughts on this.

Chip - I would like Chris Booth to work with you on putting a draft DASH 
together.

In the meantime, I will forward turbine contracts to everyone as soon as I 
receive them.

Regards,

Ben

Per our conversation today, the turbine contract and LTSA are being sent
via Fed Ex to your office in Houston.

Final bids are due next Tuesday, June 5th via fax to 781-270-0055.  Bids
should include best price and a closing schedule (date by which bidder will
have all internal approvals necessary to enter into a binding agreement
with Seller subject only to consent from GE).

Thanks again for you patience and please call me if you have any questions,

To alert you to another item that may arise:  Some industrials have air 
permits that restrict them to running for self-supply backup generation 
only.  In such case, the air permit may have to be amended by the industrial 
before it can sell to the grid.  Feel free to call upon Gov't Affairs if you 
have a question about this.

Subject: Interconnection: Easier for EPMI/EES to purchase from industrials  

*****Please note that with the authorization below, interconnection issues 
with the attached utility still need to be addressed.  (This includes 
agreement, queue, facilities if needed, etc.)  Call us if you need 
assistance.  Thanks.


   



Attached is FERC authorization for EPMI and EES to purchase power from 
industrials NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire).  The 
industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC 
(subject to EPMI and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for 
the industrials). 

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used 
primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be "public utilities" 
subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell 
power at wholesale from such facilities to EPMI and EES without prior notice 
under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice 
filing).  
  -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; 
however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing 
requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while 
they are selling at wholesale.
 -- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the 
industrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of 
the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from 
each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.  
Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these 
purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be 
separate from our big quarterly reports.
 -- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any 
rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industrial 
to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless 
otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff.

West Desk:  This is similar to the authorization that FERC gave last week to 
purchases from industrials in WSCC.


____________________________________
On April 27, FERC issued an order granting EPMI and EES the authority to 
purchase power from IPPs at market-based rates.  As the attached order 
indicates, the effective date of the EPMI and EES rate schedules is March 6, 
2001.

Thanks.? I have changed the party to the parent of the two entities in

Otherwise, all of your changes were fine.? You can go ahead and have the

Doug, 

Here's the revised CA.? I highlighted the changed terms.? In addition, I 
deleted the prior paragraph 11 which said that the agreement supercedes a 
prior CA. 

I don't know if the InterGen indentity and signatory are the same,? but 
obviously I left that for you to determine.? I expect that the Enron entity 
which will bid will be EPMI, so I used that entity. 

(See attached file: InterGen North America CA may 18.doc) 

I beefed up the definition of confidential information due to the 
complexity of the issues, and I added 6 months to? the term since things 
won't get cranked up for a while. 

I look forward to talking to you at your convenience.? Have a good weekend. 

Kay

Plus, I suspect we run the risk this week of getting very bogged down.

No, John wants to bring all his people, so I think we will do another one of 
these next week.  One more seat at this one is not going to help him much.

Subject: Asset Financing - Structured Finance Presentation

We are planning a presentation on certain structure and contracting issues 
related to power plant asset financing on Thursday, May 10th.  The 
presentation will include lunch from Treebeard's and will begin at 11:30.  We 
have scheduled 2.5 hours for the presentation; it may be shorter, depending 
on the number of questions. 

We plan to include the Portland folks by video-conference.   If you know of 
others who would benefit from this presentation, please pass on this 
invitation; I have not intended to exclude anyone who may want to attend.  If 
there are others at remote locations, please let me or Dina Snow know so that 
we can arrange for video-conferencing.  John, I asked Shirley for the names 
of your contracts folks and have included them; I still have no information 
as to whom else you want to include.  Therefore, please forward this to your 
team members as you see fit.

Please RSVP to Dina Snow at X57099 or by e-mail to dina.snow@enron.com by 
Tuesday, May 8th.

We will e-mail the conference room location when it is confirmed.


Thanks,

Rose

Kay,

A&K did the title committment work and is now working on the Property 
Association Documents (as is Greenberg Traurig in West Palm Beach).  Ann 
Elizabeth's
last email message to me before she went on vacation was that A&K was the 
designated hitter for the Midway Project.    You have been copied on those 
docs which we desparately need to get to Cooney Midway Groves, the property 
owner.  As far as I know, they have not been involved in anything else 
related to Midway this year.

Christi left me a message saying that Lloyd Will or one of his guys needs to 
review the Interconnction Agreement. I do not know Lloyd.

Greg

PS we had a good meeting with DERM on the landfill closure issues in the 
Certosa Holdings deal.   I'll try to reach you this afternoon to discuss.

Kay:

Attached are my changes to the Pompano Agreement. I reviewed the last version 
dated 4-19 which was approved internally (copy also attached), and made 
changes back to that draft where I felt appropriate.

The only section I did not add back in was the termination section. From a 
commercial perspective, I think we're better off leaving it out as we then 
have in effect a free option on the site (as a developers agreement is 
required to obtain building permits). 

Please let me know what you think.

Regards,

Ben

Never stayed there.  My current favorite is the Omni, which is in one of may

can buy reasonably priced bagels, cokes, etc.  Last year I also stayed at the 
Marriott Marquis (BIG, right on Times Square) and the Mark (too snooty).  I 
stayed two other places I didn't like, but the names escape me.

I've seen some other smaller hotels which look nice, and if I check a map I

I don't know if you gain anything - the land can be on b/s without putting 
the entire project on b/s, per Herman and Mary Cilia.  My guess is that we'd 
consolidate the other LLC anyway - so the accounting treatment of the land 
would not change by changing the owner of the land, I don't think.

Question for the team:

If it appears that we may have land which may not be able to stay off balance 
sheet, is it preferable to have the land held by a different LLC than the 
project LLC, with a lease to the E-Next/OBS compliant project co?  

If that is the case, what about the possibility of burdening the land with 
some low dollar hard costs?  I don't have anything in particular in mind, it 
is more of a theoretical question.

Thanks,

Mathew,

Per our conversation yesterday, I would reiterate the importance of a team 
meeting on our potential project with the Seminoles given that there will be 
a lot of complex legal structuring required for the project in addition to 
all of the commercial structuring that you are still evaluating.  

As a general rule, you should know that under federal law, Indian tribes are 
legally treated as sovereign nations and so they are immune from regulation 
by a state government and immune from federal and state court jurisdiction 
unless they consent to it.  They are entitled to establish their own 
governing laws and regulations and are subject to very unique federal law 
requirements.  To illustrate, with respect to our potential project with them 
it means we will need to address such issues as: (1) getting BIA approval for 
our site acquisition on Indian land, non-Indians can only lease tribal land 
and for our type of transaction, our lease will require approval from the 
BIA; (2) tribal taxes may impact the facility; (3) tribal permits, licenses 
etc will apply, including tribal environmental laws -- the tribe may have its 
own tribal EPA for instance; (4) preserving the right to challenge any tribal 
taxes or regulations in courts, other than the tribal courts; (5) 
specifically getting waivers of sovereign immunity from the Tribe so that we 
can subject them to federal court jurisdiction; (6) specifically ensuring 
that the Tribe has complied with its own constitution and tribal rules in 
executing agreements so that such agreements are enforceable; and (7) 
specifically getting a waiver from the Tribe acknowledging and agreeing that 
Enron is not subject to the jurisdiction of the tribal courts.  Evaluating 
all of the above as well as the numerous other issues that will likely arise 
will require consultation with and the cooperation of the Tribe. 

As you know, I am still in the process of identifying outside counsel who is 
an expert in Indian law matters.  As an update on that, our other Florida law 
firm currently represents the Seminoles on other matters so they are 
conflicted out of representing us.  Presently, I am waiting to hear back from 
an Indian lawyer who was involved in the recent hotel/gaming development 
transaction between the Seminoles and the Hard Rock Cafe group.  Although he 
is based in Wisconsin, he is with a very large firm which has offices in 
Florida and Washington, DC, and which currently represents Enron on other 
matters.  After speaking with him, I will further debrief you and if we elect 
to engage him, I will then seek my internal approvals for doing so.  

In the interim, I have been receiving advice from a retired Vinson & Elkins 
lawyer who has worked with Enron on its other dealings when Indian tribes 
were involved (ie, right of way agreements involving our pipeline 
companies).  He has prepared a brief memo on his views on our letter of 
intent and general issues that arise when dealing with tribes.  I would be 
happy to share that document with you (note that I have tried to summarize 
most of it above.)  As a result of that memo, I do have some changes to 
incorporate into our letter of intent and I am still waiting to hear from you 
on how to modify the letter of intent based on your prior email.  (I also 
have a more comprehensive legal paper entitled "Energy Business in Indian 
Country: Opportunities and Obstacles" if you are having trouble sleeping at 
night.)  

Lastly, as for Bill Bryant's current activity below, based on what you've 
told me and the email traffic, he seems as if he is looking at the right 
regulatory issues, but with an area of law as so complex as this is, I would 
caution that you and Marchris should narrowly define and monitor his 
activities as it could otherwise quickly result in a very expensive research 
project.  

Thanks and please let me know when we discuss this project further.  At a 
minimum, I would suggest that we try to focus on finalizing the letter of 
intent with the Seminoles so that we can begin the process of exchanging 
confidential information and entering into more substantive discussions with 
them.

Mathew,

The law looks strong for our position although there is some contrary 
authority. I believe that the contrary Attorney General's opinion (not 
involving electric generation) can be distinguished. We are checking with the 
BIA in Washington and the Governor's office to see if there are any recent 
congressional acts or compacts with the tribe that would govern. (We are 
using as the basis for our inquiry a computer facility hypothetical that does 
not involve electric generation.)

We are also checking for Comprehensive Planning documents that may control 
land use on the reservation. It shouldn't be a problem unless the Plan is 
considered to be an environmental regulation.

We will keep you posted.

Bill,

As I mentioned on my phone message, if you are already in the process of
investigating how the Florida Siting Act applies to the Seminole Indian
Tribe of Florida ("SIT"), you may disregard this message.  If not, allow me
to explain.

We have been discussing potential generation opportunities on land owned by
SIT.  One project consists of coal-fired generation which would be located
on SIT's Brighton Reservation and the second project consists of a natural
gas-fired plant located on a site in Hollywood, FL.  Under either scenario,
we are curious as to how the Florida Power Plant Siting Act would apply.
SIT is of the opinion that the Siting Act may not apply to them.

Before we make any assumptions regarding this matter, could you review the
matter and let us know your opinion.  We are considering scheduling a
meeting with SIT at the end of next Friday, May 24.

Do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3526 cell (713) 594-0439 with any
comments or questions.

Thanks,
Mathew M Gimble

You definitely have to have patience to deal with all the "stuff" around 
here.  It's a good thing I've mellowed. Plus, it's my job.  

Michael is a doll!  I don't think it's supposed to rain on Saturday, but that 
could change at any moment.  The Women's Center needs all kinds of things.  I 
have a friend that works for the United Way and goes over there quite often.  
If you have clothes, they want you to take them to their Resale shop but they 
also need linens, just everything really.  I usually give my things to 
Kristine's church just because I always forget to put them in the truck and 
bring up here.  

I've got next Thursday and Friday on my calendar.  I hope you guys have a 
great time.  21, I remember that, wild child that I was!  Any of the camera 
places should be able to do that enlargement.  I know Wolfe Camera over at 
Allen Center does that type of thing.  I don't know how long it will take to 
get it back.  What exactly do you want to get done, and I'll call and 
inquire.  I'll need the size you want it mounted to also.

This place amazes me!  Thanks for  your help.  I have no patience for it.

We went to Michael's school conference today.  His teacher raved about how 
everyone just loves Michael. He is so sweet.  He is staying with my folks 
this week, and the 3 of us miss him so badly.  I can't wait for him to come 
home.  Neil is going to meet my folks and Michael in Palacios this Friday, 
and spend the weekend there, bringing him home on Sunday.  I've got to take 
Roscoe for his last mange shot, so I'm staying.  Plus, I spent last weekend 
with my folks, and too much exposure doesn't work for us.  I hope to  PURGE 
the house of all the junk I have.  I hope it is raining, because  that is 
great cleaning weather.  I want to see bare space in my closet.  I think I'll 
call the Women's Center and see what type of stuff they need.

I'm planning on taking next Thursday and Friday off.  Next Thursday is 
Paige's 21st birthday, so we have great plans.  Do you know anywhere that can 
enlarge a photo and mount it on a board?

I still get a bill for the card they used previously for my phone.  Go figure.

I need to send off my Tx tax and bar dues today.  I'll want to fed ex, just 
in case you are sending anyone else's today.

Thanks,

Kay

I still need your credit card information for the phone bill.

The value in the table is the beginning balance for each month.  So if they 
cancel in the middle of the month, they should pay the balance at the 
beginning of that month and no prorated minimum monthly fee.  If you prorate 
it on both ends, you end up getting the total balance shown at the beginning 
of the month.

Kay, see attached.  The monthly fee should be $13,003.  I took the $300k we 
have all been discussing and backed out the $12,500 they paid under the ILA

We need internal agreement on the cancellation fee schedule, to be included

What is the status of the Yazoo City master gas agreement?  Do we still want 
a master gas agreement for Clarksdale, also?  Do we want it now?

Subject: Open items for MDEA

Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of 
the agreement:


How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily 
average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?

Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?

We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?

We aren't making money on gas, right?

Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to 
the picture?

Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  

It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the 
following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) 
formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to 
work on.   Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost 
of power)?  How are we setting the bogey?  Formula?  Subject to audit? Two 
bogeys or one (gas and oil)?

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or 
two would be helpful as a reality check.  What costs are included on the buy 
and sell side?

Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split 
costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these 
questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay:

I spoke to Dave, and he's on board with us signing the agreement. We will 
need to have an i-DASH signed prior to the guarantee being issued. He wants 
us to make sure that the termination section is adequate such that if we want 
to terminate the agreement prior to the payment becoming due, that we will be 
relieved of our obligation to make the payment. I think the agreement does 
that (although it's not the best language), and Debbie is adding some 
language to make it a bit better without sticking their nose in it too deep 
(I asked her to take the language from the Pompano draft). In any case, Duran 
wants a voice-mail from you that from a legal perspective, the termination 
section is sufficient to relieve us from obligations under the agreement to 
the extent we terminate prior to the date upon which those obligations arise.

We can talk about this tomorrow. Debbie would like to have a conference call 
at 10 AM central if you're available.

Regards,

Ben

I do not have originals of these documents and in fact was able to obtain
copies of these documents only from Freshfields.  I recall that that
Freshfields coordinated directly with GE to obtain these documents.   Do you
happen to have the originals?  If not, how do you feel about asking GE for
the originals?

Also, per my earlier voice mail, we still need copies of the following
documents to complete our closing volume for ENA:

Confidentiality Agreement
Notice of Intent to Purchase Specified Option Property
Assignment and Assumption Agreement
Bill of Sale

If you prefer, we could prepare the closing volume omitting these documents
altogether, or alternatively, listing (but not including copies) of these
documents.  Please advise of your preference.

Finally, can you please furnish the Notice of Intent to Purchase, Assignment
and Assumption Agreement and Bill of Sale for the CA Energy Development
transactions in order that I can forward these to George Kutzschback per his
request.  Thanks.

Ann Elizabeth,

Lisa Bills has requested some additional changes to the "form" of Option 
Agreement I sent you yesterday.  If you will e-mail the form of Option 
Agreement for the new Florida Option to Kay Mann, she will make the necessary 
changes.  Also Ben Jacoby has indicated that  wants to see all new Option 
Agreements prior to them being sent out to anyone so he can be in the loop.

Sorry you missed our meeting.

Kathleen

Ann Elizabeth,

This may not be the absolute latest Form of Option, but it should be pretty 
darn close to being totally blessed (by Herman Manis).  I am also attaching a 
form of Memorandum of Option just in case you need it.

Kathleen

Kay -- Could you forward me e-versions of (1) the completed one month 
Clarksdale transaction, (2) the draft transaction document you feel is the 
best template from the point of view of the seller of the marketing services 
and (3) the finalized term sheet, if there was one, before the parties 
started to work on the definitive agreement relating to Clarksdale?  My 
'Virginia garbage burners' transaction has awakened, with negotiations 
occurring tomorrow.  Thanks, David

Hi there,

I believe Chris should be back today, so I wanted to follow up on this.

I don't have any recollection of where we left the escrow agreement with
NW.  Please get with MKahn or Jerry DeBerry to see if we can get consensus
on the current form of escrow agreement.  Once we have that, Enron (Chris)
will make contact with Citibank.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay,

I apologize for the previous email.  I have been working with Wilson on the 
consequential damages issues with respect to the Enron contract with 
Clarksdale.  The message I created was intended for Wilson and I accidentally 
sent it to you.

Wilson and I hope to have a product for you this afternoon regarding the 
consequential damages issue.  Feel free to contact me if you have any 
questions.  Again, I apologize for the interruption and inconvenience.

Thanks,
John Brunini

>>> <Kay.Mann@enron.com> 06/06/01 08:09AM >>>

Wilson,

We are running short on time.  We are planning to sign on  Tuesday, and I
hesitate to put a new document in front of them at this late date. Would it
be easier to work with reps/warranties?

I definitely need an answer from your firm confirming (1) enforceability
(2) obligation of the Cities to financially support agreement.

Also, could you provide me with the Mississippi law defn of consequential
damages and a couple of examples where Enron could be responsible for same
under this agreement?  Also, can MDEA and the Cities be liableto Enron for
consequentials (absent a waiver)?

Your comments to the previously forwarded draft would be greatly
appreciated.

Kay

Also, do you have any comments to the draft agreement I sent out last week?

I also need an opinion that the language in the agreement re the Cities

You'd mentioned that you wanted consequential damages info analyzed in terms 
of the MS UCC.  Our UCC provides for recovery of consequential damages to the 
buyer, but not to a seller.  In the Enron power marketing contract, is it 
correct to say that enron acts as the seller?  If that is the case, then the 
city could recover consequentials from enron , but Enron couldn't recover 
consequentials in the event of breach by the city.  In addition, the city 
probably could not agree to be responsible for consequentials b/c of the 
limitations on city's ability to enter into such agreements.  Let me know if 
you think that analysis is incorrect.

>>> <Kay.Mann@enron.com> 06/05/01 06:25AM >>>
Wilson,

We are trying to finalize this transaction by next Tuesday, and I could
really use your help.  I believe you owe me a draft of an opinion letter?
Also, do you have any comments to the draft agreement I sent out last week?

I also need an opinion that the language in the agreement re the Cities
obligation to financially support MDEA is sufficient.

Thank you,

Kay

No problem.  I just wanted to let eveyone know why it took so long to
turn the new draft and so that they could all be sure that their
comments are in this most recent draft.

Peter, I think I know the path that had revisions made past your
original.
Dale Rasmussen here in Portland (ENA Legal) had outside legal Tom
Constantine of LLGM) coordinate his work.  We were slow on the uptake to
recognize the original author.
We keep putting our comments in to Dale, and they of course went to
LLGM.
So, as we were putting this all together, we discovered the "rest of the
story" so to speak.  I apologize for the confusion, and will let Tom and
Dale know what has transpired.

Thanks for your  help in this effort.

Regards

Bill W.

Further to our conversation with Marguerite, attached please find a mark-up
of the Escrow Agreement.  Once  you have run the revised draft by Citibank

forward the document to Kay Mann for signature.

Thanks,

Was Michael's performance outstanding as usual?  It's been very quiet here 
this afternoon.  Your little man is so cute!  You need to take a good picture 
so I can put it on canvas and frame it for you.  It looks so professional and 
expensive.  Or, I could take a picture of your family and do it for you.  I 
wish someone would take a photograph of all of us!

Greg and Isabel:

I still need signed copies of the following closing documents for our
closing volumes:

1.  Legal Opinion of counsel to GE;
2.  GE Parent Guaranty;
3.  Promissory Note of the LLC payable to PPL;
4.  Security Agreement by the LLC in favor of PPL;
5.  Financing Statements by the LLC;
6.  Letter of Credit furnished by GE;
7.  GE Acknowledgement of Receipt; and
8.  Consent of Directors of the LLC electing officers (signed by Kenneth
Ross).

Also, we have signed copies, but would like original signatures of the
parties other than ENA if available, of the following documents:

1.  Letter Agreement;
2.  Escrow Agreement;
3.  GE Letter re Forms of Agreement;
4.  ENA Letter re Forms of Agreement;
5.  Entitlement Letter Agreement;
6.  ENA Consent and Agreement;
7.  GE Consent and Agreement; and
8.  Escrow Disbursement Instructions.

As to the second list, there is no need for re-execution of any documents,
but I recall that you were having a sufficient number of originals signed by
your clients to provide an original signature to ENA.  Please advise of the
timing for forwarding these documents.  Thank you.

Kay,

Does Merchant Energy Ventures LLC have any auditable financials?  If not can
Enron give some form of parent guarantee?

Let me know if either is possible.

We are planning a presentation on certain structure and contracting issues 
related to power plant asset financing on Thursday, May 10th.  The 
presentation will include lunch from Treebeard's and will begin at 11:30.  We 
have scheduled 2.5 hours for the presentation; it may be shorter, depending 
on the number of questions. 

We plan to include the Portland folks by video-conference.   If you know of 
others who would benefit from this presentation, please pass on this 
invitation; I have not intended to exclude anyone who may want to attend.  If 
there are others at remote locations, please let me or Dina Snow know so that 
we can arrange for video-conferencing.  John, I asked Shirley for the names 
of your contracts folks and have included them; I still have no information 
as to whom else you want to include.  Therefore, please forward this to your 
team members as you see fit.

Please RSVP to Dina Snow at X57099 or by e-mail to dina.snow@enron.com by 
Tuesday, May 8th.

We will e-mail the conference room location when it is confirmed.


Thanks,

Rose

Hey!  Since Jerry would like to assemble six original sets of the Letter
Agreement and Guaranty, I think it would be worthwhile to get 5 additional
signature pages for the Guaranty.  Let me know if you think otherwise.

Talk to you soon,

Marisa

Hello.

I have one original Enron signature which I can have delivered today.  If
we need more, then I'll have to get more signed (duh).

Thanks,

Ann Elizabeth,

Attached is a form of interconnect agreement that was sent to Christi Nicolay 
of government affairs for her review from a regulatory perspective.  She 
forwarded it to me for legal review, but am I forwarding it to you since it 
is connection with one of your projects.  In addition, Herman Manis of 
accounting and Lisa Bills and Rose Engeldorf of finance need to review these 
agreements from their acocunting and finance perpsectives.  I am currently in 
the process of reviewing other forms of interconnect agreements with them and 
will share with you what I learn from my meetings with them.  As of now, I 
can say generally that the issues that they tend to modify are: (1) making 
the interconnect agreement subject to a notice to proceed requirement which 
we control the issuance of; (2) not having a parent or letter of credit 
guaranty; (3) broad assignment language; and (4) limited indemnification 
obligations.

The agreement they sent was a generic and they are working on a specific 
agreement for Midway.  If you see significant issues in the generic, perhaps 
we should not wait until we get the specific agreement but start pushing to 
negotiate the known issues now.  We have a meeting with the FPL planning 
group on the 17th but on Monday I'll call and see who we will be negotiating 
the agreement with.

I'm not sure. We are trying to copress the 
engineering/procurement/construction schedule by getting them to start work 
while we negotiate this agreement.  
Perhaps if you could review and give us general comments this week.  By then 
we may be in a better position to tell you when we would need a draft turned.

Does this work for you?

I am helping Karl put together execution documents for the various parties.  
My question to you is who should the Assignment and Assumtion Agreement and 
the Bill of Sale go to at Salmon Energy LLC, GE Packaged Power and Wilmington 
Trust Company?  I will send you the originals for Enron and E-Next.  
In addition, the signature for E-Next by WTC was not notarized on the Bill of 
Sale.  I will send it back to them for notarization, but will need to know 
who to send it to.  Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.

With regard to Lisa's comments, consider the following:

What is the per UNIT turbine purchase amount? - the Unit Liability
Amount

in the 2nd para. of 5.4 Cancellation and in 6.1.3 Retention Letter(s) of
Credit for example,
each UNIT is discussed. - This is the way each breakout agreement was
set up.  Cancellation is to be on a Unit basis, which is why Exhibit I
refers to percentages of the Unit Liability Amount. Retention was also
to be 5% of the purchase amount of each Unit - $788,500.   This should
probably be $788,486.25, so that 4 Units multiplied by 788,486.25 =
$3,153,945 (the final payment amount) I had just rounded up.

Also, how does anyone know for 6.1.3 when the last $788,500
per Turbine is supposed to be paid so we can retain it? -Section 6.1.2
states that the final payment is subject to Section 6.1.3.  The final
payment is due January 21, 2002.

As to why we don't define "Purchase Amount" as the total actual amount
expended, I leave that for you to explain to Lisa.

As for the need to change the dates in 6.1.2 and Exhibit I, that is up
to the business folks.

Call me if you want to discuss.

Subject: LV Cogen Turbine Contract


Rose and I have reviewed the contract Peter sent to us yesterday - the
draft distributed on April 24.  Rose has already provided our comments
to Peter on the Override Letter which accompanies the contract.  I have
one big issue which the lawyers can't answer as it is a business
decision.  No one seems sure if Bill is the acting originator for this
contract or not.  I leave it up to the LV Cogen Origination team to
decide.  However, until I receive word back from the appropriate person
and see my changes reflected in the turbine contract, Finance has not
signed off on this agreement so it cannot be executed on E-Next's
behalf.

What is the per UNIT turbine purchase amount?  The Purchase Amount is a
remaining total balance outstanding.  In 6.1.2 Payment Schedule, the
payment amount is a lump sum.  However, in the 2nd para. of 5.4
Cancellation and in 6.1.3 Retention Letter(s) of Credit for example,
each UNIT is discussed.  There needs to be an allocation of the Purchase
Amount and Payment Amount on a per turbine basis so Finance can track
these costs as such in case a change order is made to only one turbine
or if a turbine is removed from E-Next prior to all turbines being
removed.  Also, how does anyone know for 6.1.3 when the last $788,500
per Turbine is supposed to be paid so we can retain it?

Also, I would appreciate receiving a clarification of why we don't
define the Purchase Amount as the total and not just the balance
remaining.  It could create discrepancies in the document and for
anybody reading the document trying to understand how much each turbine
costs.  E-Next has already made the approx $10mm payments made to-date.
However, if someone were to pick up the document to find out how much
they could buy the turbines for, it would appear to be $53.6mm not the
Maximum Liability Amount of $63.1mm.  2nd para of 5.4 refers to the
portion of the Purchase Amount to be adjusted upon cancellation.
However, Exhibit I Cancellation refers to the Unit Liability Amount as
the basis for calculation - this seems inconsistent to me.


Now for the general comments:

Section 1.69 and 1.70 need to change places to be alphabetically
correct.

6.1.2 calls for a payment to be made on April 21, 2001.  Exhibit I
Cancellation also has a line for cancellation between March 21 and April
20, 2001.  This will need to be amended as this payment wasn't made
given no contract execution yet.  As everyone knows also, E-Next must be
the party to make this payment to insure the correct accounting
treatment.

6.5 is another place where a per Unit price is discussed for increases
or decreases.  How is this possible with an aggregate Purchase Amount?

In all Notice sections please delete "c/o Las Vegas Cogeneration II,
L.L.C."  This project is not associated with the E-Next financing.

10.2.3.1 Please underline "Optional Delivery Point"

10.12.2  Please delete the " ' " in "it's" after the proviso.

10.15  The timing of 120 days for delivery of serial numbers herein is
inconsistent with the bracketed 5 months in 10.2.1 and Exhibit P.
Please conform all to the same time frame.

Has David Marshall reviewed all the insurance provisions of this
document.  While a standard turbine contract, there have been some
recent modifications/views from our insurance providers.

I look forward to hearing back from the deal team and reviewing the next
round of documents.

In speaking to Marvin, he indicated that Clarksdale's authority and the 
protocals for increasing rates (electric, water & sewer) were detailed in the 
statute.  He indicated that it may be in Section 21, but perhaps Miss legal 
would know better.  Under the statute, he indicated that rate approval is 
subject to Board Approval.  I just want to confirm this info as well as 
review the same information for Yazoo.  I don't need or want a copy of the 
entire statute, but only the 5-10 pages which might be applicible to the 
subject above.  The same is needed for Yazoo.  If this is not specific enough

Based on what Dave says below we should then structure our toll such that we 
can dispatch each unit at whatever the part-load MW rating is that GE still 
guarantees at 9PPM NOx on gas, and 42PPM NOx on oil.

No.....we can never exceed our NOx permit limits.  Some permits specifically 
identify a range of normal operations and don't allow you to operate outside 
of that range regardless of your emissions.  We don't have a similar 
prohibition in the Midway permit.  My statement about operating between 50% 
and 100% load was based on the belief that our NOx guarantee will be good 
within this range and that we can pass one-time emission tests for CO, VOC 
and PM10 at as low as 50% load factor.

Also, since this is a PSD permit, our hours are unaffected by the actual 
emissions, only by the permitted hours of operation and fuel consideration 
(i.e., the 2-for-1 trade above 250 hours of oil firing).

Thanks for the info. I just want to make sure I understand your message 
correctly. Notwithstanding wgat the emissions may be, you believe we can 
operate between 50% and 100% load when firing either gas or oil. So, if gas 
emissions are 50PPM NOx, and oil is 100PPM (obviously a hypothetical), our 
operating hours would not be reduced to a greater extent that if we were at 
100% load and 9PPM and 42PPM NOx. Is this correct?

FYI, there is nothing in the permit that provides an allowable lower limit on 
the turbine load factor.  In the permit application, we provided emission 
estimates for 50 to 100 percent load and termed this as the "expected range 
of operating conditions".  We can operate below 50 percent load, but would 
likely need to do initial stack compliance tests at the lowest load we would 
operate the plant.

Since the emission guarantees from GE will likely be for a range of 50 to 100 
percent load factors, I suggest that we adopt 50 percent load (approximately 
85 MW per turbine) as the mimimum turbine load.

transaction is described as follows:

 A potential power plant site development and asset management services 
related to the Island End Generation Project, a nominal  365 MW combined 
cycle power generation facility, proposed to be located in Everett, 
Massachusetts.

The current draft of the CA contains this language:

 From the time of the signing of this Agreement until October 1, 2001 neither 
Party shall pursue the Proposed Transaction without  the participation of the 
other Party, unless the other Party consents in writing or notifies the other 
Party that it does not intend to   pursue the Proposed Transaction.

In accordance with policy, this issue is being submitted to you for your 
review.  

John can be contacted at 978 449 9936.  My extension is 57566.

Thank you,

Kay

Here is the entire CA:

Herman/Billy,

This is still very early in the process, but some thought as to structure 
options for earning recognition might be worthwhile.

I've made some revisions the Bill's document to make sure we are on the same 
page before I prepare the LOI.  

 << File: NRG Term Sheet.doc >> 

Do we want to give any sort of description of how the benchmark will be set?
Do we want to mention the cancellation provisions?

Thanks,

Kay

Subject: GE Override Letter - New LM6000 

Peter - I understand that you will be working on the latest LM6000 contract.  
I have attached a copy of the override letter - one we executed in January.   
I am not sure how much is applicable to this particular contract; I have not 
proofed the letter against it.  Would you take a look at it and check it 
against the latest version of the LM6000 contract you are working on?  Maybe 
we can talk later this afternoon about any changes you think need to be 
made.  At the least, we will need to conform the letter for this contract's 
details.

Thanks again for your help.

I'm not trying to be difficult, just didn't understand. I'll call you between 
10 and 12:30 to give you an update and verify that I'm proceeding on the 
right track.

Yes,which is what prompted my email this am. I'm looking for a way to

Wilson,

We are running short on time.  We are planning to sign on  Tuesday, and I
hesitate to put a new document in front of them at this late date. Would it
be easier to work with reps/warranties?

I definitely need an answer from your firm confirming (1) enforceability
(2) obligation of the Cities to financially support agreement.

Also, could you provide me with the Mississippi law defn of consequential
damages and a couple of examples where Enron could be responsible for same
under this agreement?  Also, can MDEA and the Cities be liableto Enron for
consequentials (absent a waiver)?

Your comments to the previously forwarded draft would be greatly
appreciated.

Kay

availability this afternoon? Both Rod and I are available.

>>> <Kay.Mann@enron.com> 06/05/01 06:25AM >>>
Wilson,

We are trying to finalize this transaction by next Tuesday, and I could
really use your help.  I believe you owe me a draft of an opinion letter?
Also, do you have any comments to the draft agreement I sent out last week?

I also need an opinion that the language in the agreement re the Cities
obligation to financially support MDEA is sufficient.

Thank you,

Kay

Steve:

I have forwarded my comments on the Pompano agreement to Kay, and plan to 
follow up with her tomorrow. A commercial point that no one has raised with 
me is the escalation on the $650k payment. I am not in favor of this. Where 
did this come from? Please advise.

Thanks,

Ben

Michael had his transplant Monday, and is doing "as well as can be
expected."  He's still feeling the effects (nausea, etc.) of the chemo he
received last week and is anxious about possible side effects and whether
the transplant will, in fact, work.  He'll be in isolation until his white
blood cells are such that he'll be able to fight off germs, then perhaps in
the hospital in non-isolation for a while, then into an apartment near the
hospital for 3 months or so in order to be able to get back there ASAP
should problems develop.
Set out below is a copy of an article from a web site about bone marrow
transplants that I should have sent out a while ago.
I'll keep you posted on Michael's progress.
Bob

Bone marrow transplant
Description:
Bone marrow is a soft fatty tissue found
inside bones. It produces blood cells (red blood cells, platelets
</conditions/ency/article/003647.htm> , and white blood cells). When the
patient develops disease of the blood cells (anemias
</conditions/ency/article/000560.htm> , leukemias, or lymphomas) or when
cancer  </conditions/ency/article/001289.htm> treatment (chemotherapy
</conditions/ency/article/002324.htm> and radiation therapy
</conditions/ency/article/001918.htm> ) damages or destroys the bone marrow,
a transplant with healthy bone marrow can save the patient's life. Patients
need bone marrow transplants because they have dangerously low white blood
cells (which are needed to fight infection) as a result of cancer treatments
or have cancer of the blood cells.

Bone marrow transplant patients are usually
treated in specialized centers and the patient stays in a special nursing
unit (bone marrow transplant unit: BMT) to limit exposure to infections.

Donated bone marrow must match the patient's
tissue type. It can be taken from the patient, a living relative (usually a
brother or a sister: allogeneic), or from an unrelated donor (found through
the national marrow donor program which lists more than 700,000 potential
donors). Donors are matched through special blood tests called HLA tissue
typing (see HLA antigens  </conditions/ency/article/003550.htm> ).

Bone marrow is taken from the donor in the
operating room while the patient is deep asleep and pain-free (under general
anesthesia). Some of patient's bone marrow is removed from the top of the
hip bone (iliac crest). The bone marrow is filtered, treated, and
transplanted immediately or frozen and stored for later use. Bone marrow
transplant is transfused into the patient through a vein (IV line) and is
naturally transported back into the bone cavities where it grows quickly to
replace the old bone marrow.

What to Expect After:
Bone marrow transplant prolongs the life of
a patient who would otherwise die.  Relatively normal activities can be
resumed as soon as the patient feels well enough and after consulting with
the doctor.

The other significant problems with a bone
marrow transplant are those of all major organ transplants--finding a donor
and the cost of the surgery. The donor is usually a sibling with compatible
tissue. The more siblings the patient has the more chances to find the right
donor.

Convalescence:
The hospitalization period is from 4 to 6
weeks, during which time the patient is isolated and under strict monitoring
because of the increased risk of infection. The patient will require
attentive follow-up care for 2 to 3 months after discharge from the
hospital. It may take 6 months to a year for the immune system to fully
recover from this procedure.

Risks:
The major problem with bone marrow
transplants (allogeneic type) is graft-versus-host disease
</conditions/ency/article/001309.htm> ; the opposite of the graft rejection
</conditions/ency/article/000815.htm> problems seen in other transplants (
transplant rejection  </conditions/ency/article/000815.htm> ). The
transplanted healthy bone marrow cells tend to attack the patient's (host)
cells as though they were foreign organisms. In this case, drugs to suppress
the immune system ( immunosuppression  </conditions/ency/article/000818.htm>
medications) must be taken indefinitely, weakening the body's ability to
fight infections.

Waiting on response from your people about :  
Meeting with adjuster about going after SWPC.
Hiring engineering expert to hopefully refute underwriter's surveyor's 
opinion.

Have written letter to ship owner to extend time for filing suit (this 
protects the subrogation interests of the underwriter).

Seeking clarification as to policy requirement of filing "suit" against 
underwriter within one year of occurrence.  Broker feels that this is not 
necessary as the claim was filed and is currently pending, but will get 
written clarification from underwriter/adjuster.

Carlos Sole to contact New Orleans attorney who represents SWPC underwriter 
about joining in their suit against ship owner.

If any one above has anything else to add, or corrections to what I have 
listed above, please add at this time so we are all on the same wave length.

Yes Kay.  It shlould be the last version from Peter Thompson of AK sent April 
24th.  Tom Constantine and I just left Peter a voice mail to ask him to 
resend to Tom for a double check.  I wil ask Tom to forward it to you.  I 
have nothing to add to these contracts, and want to get out of the loop to 
eliminate confusion.

This does not mean I will not help or answer any questions, just that Dale 
has asked Tom to act in Dale's place on this, and I don't want to screw 
things up....

TOM - when received or confirmed from Peter, would you please send a copy to 
Kay Mann as well (as requested below).

Yes. Let's do 1:30 for an internal call.  I'll get Suzanne to send out the 
dial-in instructions.  Let's make sure that the GE guys know NOT to call in.  
Thanks!.  I know that John Schwartzenburg will be late since he is 
TurboParking until 2 pm but let's proceed at 1:30.

Read your notes re scheduling a call w/ or w/o GE.  From John's and my 
perspective, it seems that we should first have an internal call re the 
consolidation of our assignments from weeks past  into Peter's draft contract 
and then send to GE for their review and follow up call either later this 
week or next.  Steve Swift is OK with this approach.  

At the moment we seem to be knee deep w/GE and Owner on Arcos and suspect 
that 9:30 CST (3:30 London time) will be difficult for us to call in.  
Instead, 1:30 CST would work better for us.  

If this works for the Houston gang could you let us know soonest and we will 
let Mike and Steve know as well.

Would you all be in a posiotion to get together tomorrow morning at 9:30 am 
Houston time to review the issues list and  talk about how we get to the end 
of this process with GE.  We immediately need to start the drafting of the 
Longview turbine contract and I'd like to see if we are close enough to get 
that started.  Scott, today the extension to the Agreement in Principle 
expires and we need to extend.  Can you tee this up with Steve Swift?  Our 
meeting tomorrow will be in lieu of the regularly scheduled GE call.  I'll 
let them know we will call them later this week or we'll talk next Wednesday, 
but I would like to get through whatever we need to in order to get the 
Longview Turbine Contract going.  
I've talked to John Schwartzenburg about this and he is available tomorrow 
morning.

<<City of Austin Gas Turbine Agt - Blackline of  83017 v.5 to
v.7.DOC>>


Attached is a blackline of the City of Austin Turbine Agreement
showing changes made to the version that went to GE on February 12.
This
draft includes both Lee's and Eric's changes to Exhibit A, as well as
the addition of the contacts for notices in Sections 25.1 and 25.3.
It
also contains a few minor clean-up items identified by Lisa Bills
when
she reviewed LV Cogen (e.g., the definitions of Performance Test
Certificate and Performance Test Completion Certificate were out of
order).  To complete the agreement, we will need to include the date
of
execution and Exhibit H-2.  I particularly wanted Eric to review this
before it went to the other side.  If it looks acceptable, I would be
happy to send a copy to GE.

The answer is yes but there will need to be contracts between MDEA and each
of the Cities.

David,

Is it possible for MDEA to purchase power from EPMI as an agent for the
Cities?  This will obviate the need for any type of security.

Thanks,

Because it didn't matter...you are agreeing to pay a minimum amount
regardless of the actual tax valuation, to the extent that applying tax
creditable amounts like for use of pollution control devices gets you below

Why didn't we have the following language in the tax payment section:

.  "In no event shall Payments in Lieu of Taxes include, apply to, or be
required to be made for Real Property Assets and/or Tangible Personal
Property exempt under Florida Statutes in existence as of the Effective
Date or any date prior to commencement of operations of the proposed
Facility, as such statutes may be amended from time to time."

Somehow this was missed because we didn't follow the Pompano form
closely enough...

Kay -- No problem.  I'm with you totally on this.  Reagan did send the letter 
to Marvin.  David and Marvin are meeting at 4:30 to discuss it.  Marvin has 
not heard from Bob Priest yet, but he and Reagan are both trying to follow up 
with Bob this afternoon.  We should hear from Marvin first thing in the

I'm thinking my last email was unclear.  

I assume that someone from the commercial team will send (or has sent) the 
extension letter to MDEA, YC, and Clarksdale's commercial reps for their 
review.  I assume that the  commercial reps with YC, MDEA, and Clarksdale 
will get whatever legal input they want from their own lawyers if they think 
it is necessary (may not), but as a courtesy, I sent drafts to the two 
lawyers I know about.

GE wants a letter outlining the structure of the deal (at the 10000 ft

Could you draft a letter to that effect for my review?

I do not necessarily anticipate a problem, but because I believe that Enron 
is considering the possibility of entering into another transaction with 
Ameresco, I have asked Lance Schuler to make sure that there is no conflict 
or other unintended result.  Having said that, I have no substantative 
problem with the provision addressed by Kay's email.  But let's make sure we 
run this one trap first.

Thanks,
Mark

Gentlemen,

I'm with EWS Legal, and I'm working with John Llodra (East Power origination) 
concerning a confidentiality agreement with Ameresco.  The proposed 
transaction is described as follows:

 A potential power plant site development and asset management services 
related to the Island End Generation Project, a nominal  365 MW combined 
cycle power generation facility, proposed to be located in Everett, 
Massachusetts.

The current draft of the CA contains this language:

 From the time of the signing of this Agreement until October 1, 2001 neither 
Party shall pursue the Proposed Transaction without  the participation of the 
other Party, unless the other Party consents in writing or notifies the other 
Party that it does not intend to   pursue the Proposed Transaction.

In accordance with policy, this issue is being submitted to you for your 
review.  

John can be contacted at 978 449 9936.  My extension is 57566.

Thank you,

Kay

Here is the entire CA:

R An understanding of basic financial and accounting issues relevant to 
Enron's transactions.
R A basic understanding of how Enron structures deals - the "deal space" and 
how the financial principals discussed  relate to  Enron deals.

		 Subject: World Hunger Rev 4a- JR

  I took several assignments from the last World Hunger call.  Status as 
follows:

a.   Tax language-  I have sent a prior version of Rev 4 jr to Matt G asking 
him to call me to let me know when he can talk with GE tax rep.  Steve Swifit 
and I are in London and would like to sit in on that call.  Matt to revert.

b.   Insurance Language review.   I sent same version to David Marshall and 
Paul Parrish asking for their reviews and opinion as to whether 7FA's are new 
technology.  Paul has sent us his comments.

c.   I "volunteered" to look at the termination language in world hunger, GE 
had some problems, and I had the same problem with the ARCOs contract.   I 
drafted a fix last Friday, sent to Kay M for comment.  I have included my 
suggested changes in the attached redline.  I have forwarded same fix to GE 
at end Friday for Arcos.    I have asked Kay if she still has a concern with 
the Limit of Liability as it relates to termination.  I think it works.  Kay 
to revert.

d.  I "volunteered" to work over Article 10, Exhibit B-3 and Exhibit B-6 in 
relation to Guarantees and liquidated damages.  I have done that in the 
attached redline of the T&C and Exhibits.  Enron group to confirm revised 
language.

e. Some time ago I volunteered to resurrect the language associated with the 
reduction in the LD refund in Section 10.9.8.   I had sent out a couple weeks 
ago but received no reaction.    I have entered that fix in the attached 
redline.  Enron group to confirm revised language.

f.  I have made several minor changes to definitions associated with 
performance.  Enron group to confirm revised language.

Attached is Rev4-JR version of GE T&C's and Exhibits for world hunger.  They 
start from the clean rev 4 version of the T&Cs that Peter forwarded to me at 
my request.  The attached are redlined to show my changes.  Kay has done a 
comparison of the 2 drafts so that we can review the proposed changes. 

I have not sent any of this to GE except for the termination language fix.   
I suggest that the Enron team give these a quick read before the World hunger 
call.  I can print same here and share with GE during the call unless there 
is an objection.  

I hope this will help to advance the process.  My earlier emails to Paul and 
Matt were not intended confuse the situation with different drafts.  Please 
ignore those and for the above purposes use the attached files.


Kay- I suggest that you forward to others who you feel appropriate for the 
purposes of the world hunger call on Wednesday.

misunderstanding.

With respect to CO#2, we have incorporated your final changes. Please find

I will call you first thing in the morning.

I don't need Stokes & Bartholemew to serve as lobbyists - I need them to 
continue to serve as local counsel on a few projects we're continuing to work 
on. I've been using Johnny Hayes for lobbying matters.

Kay - do we need to do anything to keep Stokes on board as local counsel for 
our Haywood and Shelby projects?

Thanks for the e-mail. Who is our lobbyist? I still have a need for Stokes & 
Bartholemew (Gif Thornton and Bill Bruce). Other that that, I think I'm 
covered. Please let me know the name of the lobbyist before terminating.

Thanks.

3) Section 3.1(b): This section obligates EPMI to =01&Propose=018 a load pr=

Hello.

I gave the Matagorda County Fair & Livestock Association $2050, and filled 
out the form for the match.  Please advise if this has been paid, as they are 
sending me a bill for the $2050, plus a finance charge.

Thank you,

Hi Kay! Happy Thursday! Have yall managed to go see a movie yet?? I don't
even know what movies are out that would be good to see. I've heard mixed
reviews on Pearl Harbor.

Well, I think that Katie and I will stick around Austin this weekend. We
really appreciate the ticket offer and PLEASE if you ever need to pass them
off again, let us know. Since I wrote you last I found out that there is a
meeting Sunday morning for the parents and kids who are going to the church
camp that Katie is going to in a couple of weeks. It's one of those days
where Bobby needs to take Annie to her camp and I need to go to this meeting
with Katie. It's with a friend's youth group, so I feel like I should go.

I think Bobby will be okay on Sunday, his sister is okay and (thankfully)
his dad has gone out of town. I'm hoping the day will pass sort of
unnoticed.

Thanks again for the ticket offer. I'm really sorry we can't take you up on
it.

Tell your family hello.

Love you!

Lisa

The problem as I see it with respect to a material default argument is that 
Article 16 re TD&I doesn't set a standard as to how/when such services will 
be furnished by GE.  Does Ex. H-1 set forth such criteria or does it merely 
describe the types of services furnished?  

Maybe in Article 16 we could try to put similar timing and cover  provisions 
as found in Article 14 re GE's warranty obligations. 

As we all know presently TD&I is a touchy subject with all the GTG vendors as 
a result of record equipment orders and lack of qualified technical reps.

I agree that the LD's don't apply as presently drafted and that we should 
discuss internally with the team before we launch back our position to GE.  
Any suggestions from the rest of the group?

Lets discuss before replying.  Do  you think lack of TDI would be material 
breach.   At first I was thinking Take Over would work, but it is related to 
Equipment.

John my only comments are in article 12 - do not be so specific in naming 
policy number and date.  ENA changes its policy - we'd need to revise the 
agreement.

Also - in Article 16 - is there a way to say lack of TDI support would be a 
default condition and may be cause for penalty LDs?  We are hearing some 
stories where GE is so short on being able to supply TDI - that weeks have 
gone by where installation of the GTs are delayed.  Are there any provision 
ties to LDs associated with Article 16? If not - we need them.

forwarded this on to the JK Group which will pay the amount shortly.  The 
matching gifts are paid quarterly.

Hello.

I gave the Matagorda County Fair & Livestock Association $2050, and filled 
out the form for the match.  Please advise if this has been paid, as they are 
sending me a bill for the $2050, plus a finance charge.

Thank you,

With Outlook, we won't be able to file as much on the email.  If you get to 
your 100mg limit, you won't be able to send emails.  I think you should print 
out the emails and have hard copies to be on the safe side.  I also don't 
know what will migrate as far as address books, etc.  I won't be here for 
this, and have asked Janette to let me migrate on Tuesday.  Otherwise, I'm 
going to be in a world of hurt.

The weather in SF is supposed to be nice.  I haven't checked it today.

I have a phone number on a post it note on my cabinet, just to the right of 
where my computer would be if I was there.  It is a lawyers name (which of 
course I can't remember), male, with a 212 or 202 phone number.  It may be 
David something or other.  Could you email me that name and number?

Do you know if there is a way for me to save my emails that I have in folders?

Bet the weather is better than this in San Fran.

like for it to be ready to go tomorrow (Wednesday, May 30).  We need to give 
time for the newspapers to run it.  Best estimate is 7-10 days, if they

In conversations with GE, it is their understanding that their guaranty
will not be transmitted until there is a fed ref number tomorrow.  The
opinion letter will be faxed as soon as the GC is available, or Kent can
sign for Dan Rowley if that is acceptable.  DRowley can sign originals on
Thursday.

The LOC is in the works, and GE understands that 10% will be retained in
escrow until the LOC is delivered.

There will be three original opinions.  There is one original guaranty, and
I'm not certain of GE's willingness to give more than that.  Obviously,
there will be only one LOC.

Kay:

FYI, I was contacted by this guy who claims to have a client that is 
interested in selling three GE7FAs that were delivered into storage last 
month. I told him that we are interested, and asked about the process. He 
told me that "bids" are due this Friday. Based on input from Duran and 
Calger, we plan to provide a non-binding expression of interest at $44 
million per unit.

Do we have any boilerplate forms we can use for this? If not, I can draft a 
letter and send it to you.

I asked about how the client intends to deal with GE, and was told that after 
a winning bidder is selected, they intend to seek GE's consent. The only 
other tid bit I have is that I called Schroeder to ask if any units were 
coming available, and he swore up and down that he did not know of any.

By the way, on Blue Dog / Northwestern, we deducted about $500k from our 
recent invoices. Attached is the letter we sent to Darst. I'll let you know 
if I hear any complaints.

Regards,

Ben

Thank you for pushing this through the various groups that we need for

we run the "final" draft past Lisa Bills, Joe Deffner and Cris Sherman.  I 
think that will have completed the internal review process.  Do you agree?

Matt

As you may know Sheila Tweed has been championing the effort to reach a 
standardized purchase contract with GE for domestic applications.  Attached 
is the current draft of the document.   

GE suggested that we have you discuss Section 5.2. with GE's tax 
representative  (David  Spradlin).   Please review Section 5.2.   GE's 
commercial person will be in London with Scott Dieball and I on Wednesday, 
Thursday and Friday.   Please let me know by voicemail  (713-646-6138) which 
of your mornings if best to get on a conference call with the GE rep. (Scott 
and I can be reached today at (44-207-783-0517).   I think it makes sense for 
Steve Swift of GE, Scott Dieball and me to listen in.  At this point I do not 
think that the language is in debate, but GE and Enron want to make sure it 
is correct before making it our default standard.

I suggest we: (i) change the choice of law from Maryland to New York; (ii) 
add an arbitration clause; and (iii) shorten the time from two years to one 
year.  I am attaching a redline of these changes and one with these changes

Kay and Ben,

I would like to send the following to Jeff Darst at GE via e-mail.

Dear Jeff,

Pursuant to you letter dated May 9, 2001 we are prepared to pay the deduct 
for liquidated damages ($536,000) and retention deduct ($965,885) withheld 
from the April 25, 2001 invoice.  Payment of the deduct for the liquidated 
damages claim does not constitute a withdrawal of the claim, hence, we are 
not waiving our rights afforded under the contract.  As stated in our letter 
dated May 3, 2001, we are prepared to pay the final 5% payment for Unit 1 
upon receipt of the Letter of Credit for $965,855 (5% of the price for Unit 
1) and a lien release. 

Regards,

Chris

Marisa,

It probably would have been helpful to you if I had sent you copies of the 
Corporate formation documents and consents that have already been executed in 
connection with Merchant Energy Ventures, LLC.  I am attaching copies for 
your reference.


 Consent appointing Ben Jacoby as POA was dated May 4, 2001. We will need to 
revoke this POA when we sell to Northwestern.

Action by sole Member removing James V. Derrick, Jr. as a Manager was dated 
April 26, 2001

The LLC Agreement was dated March 22, 2001.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kathleen

Certificate of Amendment to this effect.  A copy of the Certificate of

Read the text before looking at the picture.

A class of elementary students started a class project to
make a planter to take home and wanted to have a plant in
it that was easy to take care of, so it was decided to use
cactus plants. The students were given greenware pottery
of a clown planter, and they painted them with glaze and
had them professionally fired at a class outing so they
could see the process. It was  great fun.

They planted the cactus seeds in the finished planters, and
they grew nicely but unfortunately the children were not
allowed to take them home.

The cactus plants were removed and a small ivy replaced
them, and the children were then allowed to take the
planters home.

The teacher said cactus seemed like a good idea at the time....

he objected.

John, we need to talk about the sale of the LLC, and the generation
of a draft doc re same.  Please let me know if you are available
today to discuss this transaction with Sr. Jacoby and me.
Additionally, it would be helpful to discuss the tolling
arrangement with Ken.

Please find attached a draft letter agreement from FPL.  I've taken the 
liberty of making changes that I beleive may meet with the accounting 
requirements de jour.  Basically we need to throw this letter away and start 
over.  The balance of funds left over from the feasibility studies and 
facility study for the Midway project is $122,000.  According to Dan Meyers 
of FPL, this is about 2 months worth of work.  

We can start negotiations on the interconnection agreement any time.  I'd 
suggest we start now unless our prospective partner would want to be involved.

Attached is a CA that Ameresco is prepared to sign.? Once Enron has reviewed, 
then I will send 2 signed CA's with one original returned to Ameresco.? The 
meeting is confirmed with Joe Murphy at Cabot.? I believe he will have one or 
more people attend the meeting and he has asked the names of persons that 
will be attending.? Please let me know who from Houston besides yourself will 
be at the meeting.? I also want to have a conference call with Gil or Dave 
plus yourself to discuss strategy prior to us getting together next week.

ENA signed two originals of the Letter Agreement (as the Letter Agreement
has only two parties).  I kept one for ENA and provided the other to Greg
Lang for PPL by letter dated May 2, 2001.  I still do not have an original
of PPL's signature, but Greg Lang did provide a fax copy.    Is it necessary
for the parties to sign additional copies for non-parties?   I am checking
with ENA on the GE documents.  Thanks.

No.....we can never exceed our NOx permit limits.  Some permits specifically 
identify a range of normal operations and don't allow you to operate outside 
of that range regardless of your emissions.  We don't have a similar 
prohibition in the Midway permit.  My statement about operating between 50% 
and 100% load was based on the belief that our NOx guarantee will be good 
within this range and that we can pass one-time emission tests for CO, VOC 
and PM10 at as low as 50% load factor.

Also, since this is a PSD permit, our hours are unaffected by the actual 
emissions, only by the permitted hours of operation and fuel consideration 
(i.e., the 2-for-1 trade above 250 hours of oil firing).

Thanks for the info. I just want to make sure I understand your message 
correctly. Notwithstanding wgat the emissions may be, you believe we can 
operate between 50% and 100% load when firing either gas or oil. So, if gas 
emissions are 50PPM NOx, and oil is 100PPM (obviously a hypothetical), our 
operating hours would not be reduced to a greater extent that if we were at 
100% load and 9PPM and 42PPM NOx. Is this correct?

FYI, there is nothing in the permit that provides an allowable lower limit on 
the turbine load factor.  In the permit application, we provided emission 
estimates for 50 to 100 percent load and termed this as the "expected range 
of operating conditions".  We can operate below 50 percent load, but would 
likely need to do initial stack compliance tests at the lowest load we would 
operate the plant.

Since the emission guarantees from GE will likely be for a range of 50 to 100 
percent load factors, I suggest that we adopt 50 percent load (approximately 
85 MW per turbine) as the mimimum turbine load.

Duke Energy, Environmentalists Strike Deal over California Plant 
Tom Knudson 

May. 16, 2001 
Knight Ridder Tribune Business News - KRTBN 
Copyright (C) 2001 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World 
Reporter (TM) 

Days after state regulators gave Duke Energy the go-ahead to expand its Moss 
Landing Power Plant near Monterey Bay last fall, documents show four 
environmental groups made their own deal with the utility giant. The four 
signed an agreement not to "participate in any lawsuit (or) regulatory 
challenge" that might slow or stop the project in exchange for a financial 
concession: $1 million from Duke for environmental "monitoring and research." 

Balancing power generation and environmental protection always has been 
difficult. But today, as power-starved California scrambles to find and 
permit new energy sources, some fear the Moss Landing agreement shows that 
money can sway even environmentalists -- and tip the scales too far in favor 
of economic development.

Environmentalists who signed the agreement, though, said that despite their 
concerns about the plant expansion, they had little chance of stopping it, 
especially after it was approved by the California Energy Commission and 
Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board.

So they took the potentially controversial step: entering into an agreement 
with Duke for financial resources to pay for studies of the plant's impact on 
the marine environment.

Other environmentalists, though, criticized that approach.

Duke Energy's efforts to modernize the Moss Landing Power Plant resulted in 
mitigation payments to environmental and other groups, including:

$7 million to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation to mitigate the plant's use of 
seawater.

$425,000 to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation over three years to monitor 
heated seawater discharge in the ocean.

$1 million to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation over five years to 
monitor water quality through a program sponsored by Save Our Shores, the 
Center for Marine Conservation, the Friends of the Sea Otter and the Otter 
Project.

$100,000 to the Marine Mammal Center to relocate its triage center for 
injured animals onto power plant property.

$3.4 million to the Moss Landing Chamber of Commerce over 20 years for 
infrastructure improvements in the Moss Landing community.

$100,000 to design and construct a boardwalk for additional beach access in 
Moss Landing.

$60,000 for an environmental assessment for a proposed Elkhorn Slough Circle 
Trail. If approved, Duke would provide an additional $250,000 endowment to 
maintain the trail.

"It is very disheartening," said Carolyn Nielson, a retired teacher who along 
with some other local residents is waging a battle against what they consider 
an environmentally harmful power plant cooling system.

"These environmental groups have the expertise, the biologists, the 
attorneys," said Nielson, who has taken her case to the State Water Resources 
Control Board. "We could have been much more successful with their help. But 
there wouldn't have been any financial reward in it for them."

Such criticisms are off-base, according to Warner Chabot, regional director 
for the Center for Marine Conservation, a national environmental group that 
was among those to sign the deal. He said environmentalists got the best deal 
possible in the current energy climate.

"Look at what's happening with power plant approvals in California right 
now," said Chabot, referring to the state's push to bring new energy sources 
on line.

The Moss Landing project -- which is scheduled to add 1,060 megawatts in 
2002, enough to serve one million homes -- is a key part of that energy 
expansion plan.

No money will go to the four environmental groups -- the Center for Marine 
Conservation, along with Save Our Shores, Friends of the Sea Otter and the 
Otter Project. It will be routed, in five yearly installments of $200,000 
each, to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation, a nonprofit organization that 
helps support sanctuary programs, including scientific research.

Chabot helped found the sanctuary foundation and sits on its board. He said 
the money will be used to monitor the health of Elkhorn Slough, a 
biologically rich estuary that borders the plant and is linked to Monterey 
Bay.

"Not a dime comes to the Center for Marine Conservation," he said. "Not a 
penny comes to me."

Duke representatives said the controversy about the arrangement has been 
stirred by a handful of people.

"It's a million dollars worth of water quality studies," said Duke spokesman 
Tom Williams. "Our whole effort wasn't to try to buy anybody off. It was 
designed to help increase people's comfort level where there wasn't a comfort 
level."

The $1 million agreement signed in November is part of a package of more than 
$12 million in Duke payments to civil, government and environmental groups in 
connection with the plant modernization.

The heftiest award -- $7 million to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation, a 
nonprofit environmental organization -- was negotiated by state agencies to 
"mitigate" environmental impacts of the plant.

Formed in 1982, the slough foundation exists to promote "the wise use and 
conservation of Elkhorn Slough and surrounding wetlands," its Web site says. 
However, some environmentalists say the state-approved mitigation plan is 
inadequate.

"If you want to say, 'Who did Duke roll with a big chunk of money?' I would 
say they rolled the California Energy Commission and the Regional Water Board 
for the price of mitigation," Chabot said. "The agencies got bought off 
cheap. And the environment got taken to the cleaners."

Duke's Williams strongly disagreed. Environmental mitigation "must be based 
on science, not on buying anybody off," he said. "That is inappropriate, and 
we would not participate in that.

"That suggestion is offensive to us. And it should be offensive to any 
environmentalist."

Bob Haussler, head of the Energy Commission's environmental protection 
office, said the mitigation plan is biologically sound. "We are confident it 
will improve the slough ecosystem," he said.

Madeline Clark, a local businesswoman and founder of Monterey Parkway -- a 
citizens group that scrutinizes local public works projects -- called the 
recipients of Duke's payments a "shopping list" of government agencies, 
environmental groups and civic organizations. She was particularly critical 
of the $1 million deal with environmental groups.

"You know what bothers me?" Clark said. "Environmental groups get tons of 
donations. Their purpose is to protect and defend the environment. If a big 
corporation like Duke can come in and buy them off, I have a real problem 
with that."

Construction began in November on Duke's project to add 1,060 megawatts of 
natural gas-fired electrical capacity to the Moss Landing plant, purchased 
from PG&E in 1998.

If the expansion is finished next year, as scheduled, it would account for 
more than 30 percent of all new generation in California in 2002.

"This is a big deal," said Williams, the Duke spokesman. "It will be the 
largest plant in California. If that plant is delayed a month or two, we lose 
the summer of 2002. And that affects not only Duke Energy, but the state of 
California."

Opponents say it's not the power they oppose, but the plant's cooling system, 
which will pump about 1.2 billion gallons of seawater each day from Moss 
Landing Harbor. Such pumping, they say, will degrade Elkhorn Slough. They 
argue for an alternative cooling system, such as towers that re-circulate 
water.

"Basically, what that plant will do is take 25 percent of the volume of the 
harbor and slough, run it through a pipe and dump it back into the ocean with 
much of the marine life cooked and dead," said Steve Shimek, executive 
director of the Otter Project.

For Shimek and other environmentalists, scientific studies commissioned by 
Duke during the permitting process left key questions unanswered about the 
plant's impact on the environment.

"There was no scientific evidence that would literally point to Duke causing 
harm to the environment," said Vicki Nichols, executive director of Save Our 
Shores. "We felt we didn't have strong standing to sue."

Instead, the environmentalists began negotiating with Duke for financial 
payments for studies of environmental impacts of the modernization project.

The process "gave me tremendous pause and great concern," Nichols said. "I 
knew there was going to be some perception that we were doing the wrong 
thing."

She was right.

"As far as I'm concerned, with the price-gouging going on by the energy 
wholesalers, they are just receiving stolen goods," said Clark, of the 
citizens group.

Her skepticism was sharpened by the recent disclosure that Duke Energy 
approached Gov. Gray Davis with a secret deal offering financial concessions 
if the state dropped lawsuits and investigations into the power generator.

Chabot, with the Center for Marine Conservation, discouraged any comparison 
between the two offers, calling it "grossly unfair and inaccurate."

Regardless of what was intended with the payments, Nielson said they stain 
the process. "It is so destructive in terms of making everyone cynical," she 
said.

Shimek took a different view. "We convinced Duke to spend $1 million toward 
monitoring that, frankly, five years from now could very well come back to 
haunt them," he said.

"Did we do the right thing? I have no idea. Did we try our best? Yes, we 
did."

Kay,

Ann Elizabeth did not provide a designated hitter for the South Dade Energy 
Center (Dade Development Company LLC is Optionee, Certosa Holdings is 
Optionor) nor did she provide one for tne Medley Dunn project.  I have been 
told that the Dunns are considering backing off their ultimatums that they 
gave Ann Elizabeth and I regarding taxes to the town and assumption of 
enviromental liability.  Who do I talk to about the Dunn contract while Ann 
Elizabeth is out?

Kay Mann is the designated hitter for the Pompano and Deerfied projects while 
I'm on vacation.  I've given her a down load of the status of Greg and 
Steve's projects.  Chris Boehler at A&K will be the designated hitter for 
Midway.  I'm not going to check my voice mail while I'm gone but, if 
necessary, here are the contact numbers while I'm gone.

Walter and Marlena Schilling  011-49-8218-89351 schilling.jun@freenet.de

Monika and Bernhard Steinacher 011-49-8232-8932 m.steinacher@schwabmuenchen.de

If you call, Walter and Bernhard and Bernhard's daughter, Susanne, speak very 
good English.  Monika's isn't bad.  Marlena may get flustered and hang up on 
you.

Best of luck at Deerfield and hope to see Pompano on track when I get back in 
the office on June 11th.  Kay is planning on going to Florida on June 12 for 
the moratorium hearing and the rezoning hearing.

would like to meet with you at 9:30 to discuss the MOU. I don't believe their

Hello Kay---

I need some free legal advice and you are my favorite attorney.  I'll buy
you a drink as payment in kind.

Try and remember El Paso work in Arizona.  Arizona has statue that says you
must make a twenty day preliminary notice to file a lien.  If you don't file
such notice you waive your right to ever file a lien.  I remember this from
our previous work out there.

We have a vendor who is supplying services to one of our subcontractors.  He
has sent us a twenty day notice to file a lien.  There is no dispute but he
is sending the notice anyway.  I understand all of that.

My question is this----it asks for us (BE&K) to sign and acknowledge receipt
of the notice.  It doesn't exactly read like I am required to acknowledge
receipt.  What do you think or remember?  Am I required to sign the notice
or not.  Minor point I know, but I'd rather not raise the flag in
Birmingham.

Thanks.  I really just want to hear from you and this is all I could come up
with for an excuse to write.

Gerry Turner

I was out of the office yesterday and apologize for the delay in responding.
I'm not sure about class/type. Michael does see Sharon Seals and Associates
Speech-Language Pathologists once a week for 1 hour. The only testing has
been from Danny Williamson, Developmental Pediatrician who is an associate
of Nancy LaFever. This was an eval for ADHD. He was also tested by SBISD for
the same issue. Williamson and LaFever have all this information in his
file.
Thanks for you help with this. Neil

Hi Neil!  Michael looked so happy to see you for chapel today.  Thanks for
being there.

I have a few questions in order to complete this form.  It asks a couple of
questions about the help he is receiving outside of school.  If you could
answer them for me, I can have this turned in tomorrow.

Classification?
Type?
Hours per Week?
Has Michael received any testing from the outside help (speech/language
specialist)?

Today Michael told me that I would "have to come over soon, because (he)
would be going far away from St. Francis for summer camp".  If he is adamant
about us getting together outside of school, I would be happy to meet you
and Michael or Michael and Kay (or his sister) for a lunch date
somewhere/sometime this summer.  Let me know.

Once again, I have really enjoyed getting to know your family.  See you at
the party Wednesday at 2:15.
Kara

SUPREME COURT SAYS CAPS ON COMPENSATORY DAMAGES IN FEDERAL
JOB BIAS SUITS DON'T APPLY TO FRONT PAY AWARDS

Front pay awards in federal employment discrimination suits
are not subject to the 1991 Civil Rights Act's caps on
compensatory damages, the U.S. Supreme Court rules. The
unanimous decision resolves a circuit split in favor of the
majority view on the issue.

Front pay is money awarded either for lost compensation
between the date of judgment and the date of reinstatement
or in lieu of reinstatement. The front pay remedy has long
been available under Section 706(g) of the 1964 Civil Rights
Act. Because the 1991 Act authorized compensatory and
punitive damages "in addition to" remedies already available
under Section 706(g), the court concludes that the caps do
not apply to front pay awards. . . . Page 1727

INNOVATIVE MAINE LAW MAKING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AVAILABLE AT
DISCOUNT TO UNINSURED SURVIVES CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES

Maine's novel prescription drug price control statute is not
preempted by the Medicaid statute and does not violate the
commerce clause, the First Circuit rules. The Maine program
makes prescription drugs available at a discount to
uninsured state residents who do not qualify for Medicaid,
and requires prior state authorization of the prescriptions
of drug manufacturers who decline to negotiate rebates with
the state.

Rejecting a conflict preemption claim, the court says the
rebate negotiation and prior authorization features are
"consonant" with the Medicaid program by making prescription
drugs more accessible to low-income people. Finding no merit
to the commerce clause challenge, the court says that the
Maine statute does not apply extraterritorially or
discriminate against out-of-state manufacturers, and that
its local benefits outweigh any burden on interstate
commerce. . . . Page 1729

JUSTICES ADOPT SINGLE-ENTITY APPROACH FOR CALCULATING
PRODUCT LIABILITY LOSS OF AFFILIATES FILING CONSOLIDATED
RETURN

The product liability loss for an affiliated group of
corporations filing a consolidated return should be
determined using the single-entity approach urged by the
taxpayer, not the separate-member methodology urged by the
government, the U.S. Supreme Court decides. The ruling
resolves a circuit split on the availability of the product
liability loss carryback under Section 172 of the Internal
Revenue Code.

In the government's view, affiliates that generate positive
separate taxable income should not contribute to product
liability loss eligible for the carryback. But the court
finds the taxpayer's single-entity approach a preferable
reading of the tax code and applicable regulations,
rejecting the government's claim that it will lead to tax
avoidance abuses. . . . Page 1733

CIVIL PROCEDURE: Exacerbating a circuit split, the Sixth

EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION: Front pay is not an element of
"compensatory damages" within the meaning of the 1991 Civil
Rights Act and thus is not subject to the statutory caps on
compensatory damages in 42 U.S.C. Section  1981a(b)(3), the
U.S. Supreme Court determines. . . . Page 1727

decides. . . . Page 1730

that nonmembers must pay under a union security clause in a
collective bargaining agreement. . . . Page 1731

http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/law2.nsf/id/a0a4f3c4t2_

LOCAL GOVERNMENT: The Chicago school board's extension of
spousal health benefits to the same-sex domestic partners of
school district employees does not violate the equal
protection rights of employees who have uncovered domestic
partners of the opposite sex, the Seventh Circuit finds. . .

I'm thinking my last email was unclear.  

I assume that someone from the commercial team will send (or has sent) the 
extension letter to MDEA, YC, and Clarksdale's commercial reps for their 
review.  I assume that the  commercial reps with YC, MDEA, and Clarksdale 
will get whatever legal input they want from their own lawyers if they think 
it is necessary (may not), but as a courtesy, I sent drafts to the two 
lawyers I know about.

Ben,

I am reviewing your draft amendment with Audrey.  We have serious concerns
about the security note.  The form of the AES Corp guarantee providing
security relating to the original agreements should be all that's
required.  We have a few other comments too.

Would like to have a conference call for all interested parties as soon as
possible to resolve this.

I suggest 11:00AM  E.  Call-in # 1-800-747-5150, Access code 5584873.
Next alternative time would be 3:00PM ET.

Thanks for the e-mail. If Chuck's CA has been executed and returned to you, 
then I would assume you can go ahead and send him the drawings. I understand 
that if Sharon wants the drawings, she will have to sign a seperate CA. 
Sending the drawings to Chuck, covered by his executed CA, will certainly 
speed up the process. Let me know if you have any objections.

Thanks,

I will be available at 1:30 pm CST today.  With regard to turning the
document, I will be traveling on Thursday.  Therefore, I believe the
earliest I could have a draft of the agreement (w/o exhibits, w/o
override letter) is Friday evening.  If we could wait until Monday
delivery, I could have drafts of both the agreement and exhibits.

in.  Thanks!.  I know that John Schwartzenburg will be late since he is

Read your notes re scheduling a call w/ or w/o GE.  From John's and my
perspective, it seems that we should first have an internal call re the
consolidation of our assignments from weeks past  into Peter's draft
contract and then send to GE for their review and follow up call either
later this week or next.  Steve Swift is OK with this approach.

At the moment we seem to be knee deep w/GE and Owner on Arcos and
suspect
that 9:30 CST (3:30 London time) will be difficult for us to call in.
Instead, 1:30 CST would work better for us.

If this works for the Houston gang could you let us know soonest and we
will let Mike and Steve know as well.

Would you all be in a posiotion to get together tomorrow morning at 9:30
am
Houston time to review the issues list and  talk about how we get to the
end of this process with GE.  We immediately need to start the drafting
of
the Longview turbine contract and I'd like to see if we are close enough
to
get that started.  Scott, today the extension to the Agreement in
Principle
expires and we need to extend.  Can you tee this up with Steve Swift?
Our
meeting tomorrow will be in lieu of the regularly scheduled GE call.
I'll
let them know we will call them later this week or we'll talk next
Wednesday, but I would like to get through whatever we need to in order
to
get the Longview Turbine Contract going.
I've talked to John Schwartzenburg about this and he is available
tomorrow
morning.

Kay -- We should check each on a case by case basis.  We probably would be 
better off using any definition from the ILA since it was already found to be 
acceptable by MDEA unless there is simply a better definition in the ESMA or 
some inherent conflict or gap relative to the scope of the overall 
agreement.  For any that are not obvious to you, please do not hesitate to 
continue shooting questions at us for clarification.  Should we look at 
Ancillary Services?   Thanks -- David

Jim,

I would suggest that we arrange for another inspection of the generator at 
the Westinghouse facility here in Houston.  I would suggest that Westinghouse 
bring additional experts and would also suggest that the insurance company 
send an additional surveyor.  I firmly believe that Mr Newell does not 
appreciate complexity and of the generator and all the electrical properties 
of the insulation system and he is not going to change his mind.

I will defer to Ben for final direction.

Subject: SWPC 501D5A Generator Damager onboard M/V:  INDUSTRIAL BRIDGE

Have just talked with adjuster again, and she has preliminary verbal report 
from surveyor who says that drawings merely confirm his prior contention that 
this generator was NOT a total loss at the time of the loss, but that further 
inspection of the unit would be necessary to prove otherwise.  

The comments from Andrew Edison about pressing SWPC on their responsibilities 
and ownership of the unit, this has previously been expressed by the adjuster 
to Jim Bouillion.  She definitely would like to have a sit down meeting with 
Enron people only, not SWPC at this time,  to discuss options and where we go 
from here.  She still hasn't signed the CA, but that is not necessary as she 
is not looking at the drawings and looking at them by her is not necessary 
for the purpose of a meeting with Enron.  

I did not check her availability for a meeting at this time because my 
schedule for Mon-Tues is still up in the air, and Jim Bouillion has a Mon-Wed 
meeting with our captive insurer in Vermont and would not be available before 
Thursday.  Do we collectively want to go forward with the sit down meeting 
with the adjuster, and if yes, who all needs to be involved and what are 
their availabilities?

Concerning the VALUE of the generator, the declared value of the entire 
shipment was $24,506,000.  There is no breakdown on the paperwork I have (or 
the broker) that puts a separate value on just the generator.  Thus I guess 
someone either has that or SWPC can provide that information.  The policy is 
not a "replacement cost value"  policy nor an "actual cash value" policy, but 
a "valued" policy.  What that means is we get paid what ever we declared the 
value to be CIF + 10%.  Hence the need to know what part of the $24,506,000 
is the "value" of the generator.

I await further instructions as to how you want to proceed.

Kay:

This past Friday, I received six original signature pages to the Letter
Agreement, but did not receive original signature pages to the Guaranty.
Could you forward the signature pages to the Guaranty at your earliest
convenience?

Thanks,

Marisa

Hi there,

I believe Chris should be back today, so I wanted to follow up on this.

I don't have any recollection of where we left the escrow agreement with
NW.  Please get with MKahn or Jerry DeBerry to see if we can get consensus
on the current form of escrow agreement.  Once we have that, Enron (Chris)
will make contact with Citibank.

Thanks,

Kay

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate 
the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.

Enron is ok with signing the consents.  After the assignment of the contracts 
out of LLCs, we would like to exercise our put.  Please share this info with 
George.  

I believe Ben will be in town tomorrow (right Ben?) so we can get it signed 
up this week.

Thanks,

Kay:

I'd like to talk to you about this. Essentially what we need to do is to sign 
an agreement with FPL that does not constitute "hard costs", which allows 
them to conduct preliminary design work for our Midway project, using the 
$150k left over from the money we paid them for feasibility and facility 
studies. I'll call you Monday to discuss.

Thanks and have a good weekend.

Regards,

Ben

Please find attached a draft letter agreement from FPL.  I've taken the 
liberty of making changes that I beleive may meet with the accounting 
requirements de jour.  Basically we need to throw this letter away and start 
over.  The balance of funds left over from the feasibility studies and 
facility study for the Midway project is $122,000.  According to Dan Meyers 
of FPL, this is about 2 months worth of work.  

We can start negotiations on the interconnection agreement any time.  I'd 
suggest we start now unless our prospective partner would want to be involved.

Were we going to try and send off to GE today a revised draft of the contract 
which would include the language resulting from the tasks assigned in Peter's 
list?  

Re the list and those sections to which my name appears:

1.  Takeover - John have you revised the  text of Section 10.3.2 or should I 
take a shot at rewrite based on our discussions with GE on    Arcos.

4 and 11 Robust Scope/Change Orders - This issue has not been resolved and we 
are awaiting GE's proposal with respect to Arcos.

9   Warranty - Suggested wording has been provided to Peter.

11  Insurance - Section 19 dealing with insurance needs to be reviewed in 
light of recent discussions with insurance advisors to ensure    contract 
conforms with current insurance market conditions.

I'm on the phone with GE.  Their initial response to the assignment stuff is 
positive.  They want a letter which sets out the ownership of the LLC and 
what we are doing on payment.

I've been working on TECO term sheet, but I'm not sure I'll be done by 300, 
depending on this call.

Hi Kay. Can you please forward the faxed invoice you received to Sheila 
Tweed. I believe she may have some insight on this invoice, the due date was 
6/18/2000. Per Brian Barto it is ok to pay this invoice but we need someone 
in Legal to review and give the ok to pay.   


Thanks-

I talked to Vanessa Bob at x36781 regarding this matter.  She said she's 
forwarded this on to the JK Group which will pay the amount shortly.  The 
matching gifts are paid quarterly.

Hello.

I gave the Matagorda County Fair & Livestock Association $2050, and filled 
out the form for the match.  Please advise if this has been paid, as they are 
sending me a bill for the $2050, plus a finance charge.

Thank you,

Paul Hastings would like ENA to resign the Incumbency Certificate, since the
original Certificate did not affix the corporate seal.  Could you coordinate
this and make sure the seal is affixed to the new Certificate?  Thanks.

Call me if you have any questions.

Doug and I will provide you background.  I am not sure if you are the

This is a starting point and is fairly general (to facilitate discussions

Yes, you have initialed and Carl Tricoli has signed.  I'll walk them over to 
Marisa this morning (with the original Certificate of Incumbency) if you want 
me to.  Or, on the other hand, I can Federal Express to Tremaine Wright if 
you would rather.

Additionally, Marisa gave me a copy of the closing list highlighting things 
we are responsible for (I'll take care of the Corporate stuff).  Also, 
yesterday I sent her executed copies of the LLC Agreement and Consents that 
are (or should be in) in the Minute Book for Merchant Energy Ventures.  I 
think she will probably have to change some of the drafts of the corporate 
docs she sent to us yesterday once she reads the LLC Agreement.

The Escrow Agreement that is attached appears to be in final form and
contains all of the changes that we requested.  As a result, will you
overnight the sig pages and the incumbency certificate to Tremaine Wright?
If you prefer, you can courier the documents to my attention, and I can

incumbency certificate.  Thanks.

In order to expedite the formation of the escrow account, I am attaching the
signature page to the Escrow Agreement, and ask that you obtain three
executed originals.  Once you have obtained the required signature, please
forward the 3 signature pages to Tremaine Wright at Paul Hastings along with
the executed incumbency certificate, which Kathleen has.  Since we have not
seen the final draft of Escrow Agreement, be sure to tell Tremaine to hold
the signature pages in escrow pending further written instruction from you.
Tremaine will deliver the Escrow Agreement, incumbency certificates, fee
letter, and Form W-9 to Citibank as soon as all the documents are in order.
Tremaine's contact information is listed below:

Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker LLP
399 Park Avenue
New York, NY 10022-4697

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

The original membership certificate needs to be in the lender's hands
(i.e.,
Isabel Parker's office) on Wednesday in order to release escrow.  If you
have the original to me by Tuesday, I can forward it to Isabel by overnight
delivery for Wednesday.  It must be an original, in that the lender's lien
on the membership interest is not perfected without possession of the
original certificate.  With respect to the remaining documents, fax copies
of signature pages on the closing date should be sufficient.

Can we at least get the membership certificates signed by Tuesday?  This
seems to be the only document required in advance of closing.  If we can't
get the 80% membership interest certificate in the lender's possession on
the closing date, then there is a lien perfection issue for them to deal
with, and I thought we could accommodate their request and avoid the
problem
altogether.  Please advise, as Greg and Isabel will be calling within an
hour or so to finalize the mechanics on this.  Thanks.

Can you get executed documents back to me on Tuesday?  Greg has requested
that we send the original membership certificate representing the 80%
interest to the collateral agent Tuesday night by overnight delivery to
hold
in escrow until closing, in order that the collateral agent is in
possession
of the certificate (for purposes of legal opinions) upon closing on
Wednesday.  Greg is planning to fax signature pages of all of their closing
documents later today.  (I will be out of the office at a meeting with
another client most of the afternoon today).

There is one last question with GE dealing with the letter of credit for
the
retention amount, as this affects our disbursement instruction letter.  I
advised Greg that GE's normal practice was to send the retention L/C after
receipt of payment.  He is considering this, but may want to talk to GE
about the ability to present the L/C at closing.  Do you have any thoughts
on this?

Ben, 

I'll take a look at it today, you night owl.  Hope the kids cut you some 
slack after your late night.  

You're missing our last week of nice weather for the season.  It was 65 
degress this am.  I'm taking Herman to the game tonight, which will be 
wonderful in this weather.  Next comes 90 degrees.

Michael had his first soccer practice yesterday - actually a skills 
assessment to put them on teams.  He loved it. His big sister and her 
boyfriend took  him to buy soccer clothes afterwards.  He is wearing his shin 
guards and soccer shorts to school today.  Too cute.

Hope you are enjoying your little ones.

Kay

Ben,

Unit 1 Guaranteed Delivery Dates:     (Exhibit B-2 Schedule I)
 Turbine and Generator   11 March 2001
 Remaining Major Components  31 March 2001  

Delivery Liquidated Damages      (Section 10.3)
 Major Component   $14,500/day  (Exhibit B-6)

Calculation of Delivery Liquidated Damages:

As of May 1, 2001, the air filter housing (defined as a Major Component) for 
Unit 1 has not yet been delivered, hence the Delivery Liquidated Damage clock 
has been running for 31 days.

(31 days) x ($14,500/day) = $449,500.00 towards a cap of 10% of the Purchase 
Amount (10% of $39,103,201 = $3,910,320)

In answer to your question as to when the GE opinion should be dated, it
should be dated the execution date of the Turbine Contract, which I believe
will be tomorrow, May 2.  Please could Carolyn, Kay or Greg let Kent and

SENATE BILL WOULD EXCLUDE FROM INCOME TAX AMOUNTS RECEIVED
IN PAYMENT OF DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) introduces legislation to
exclude from taxable income awards received in judgment or
settlement for claims of discrimination or violation of
civil rights. The Civil Rights Tax Relief Act of 2001 also
would eliminate the double taxation of attorneys' fees under
contingency fee agreements and allow income averaging for
back pay and front pay awarded for discrimination claims. A
companion bill is pending in the House.

The legislation would correct an unintended consequence of
the 1996 Small Business Job Protection Act, which made
damage awards that are not based on physical injury or
physical sickness taxable to the plaintiff. "Because most
acts of employment discrimination and civil rights
violations do not cause physical injuries, this provision
has had a direct and negative impact on plaintiffs who
successfully prove that they have been subjected to
intentional employment discrimination or other intentional
violations of their civil rights," Collins explains. . . .

NLRB ADOPTS BRIGHT-LINE RULE FOR DECERTIFICATION ELECTIONS,
PROHIBITS INCUMBENT UNIONS FROM USING NONEMPLOYEES AS
OBSERVERS

The National Labor Relations Board adopts a "bright-line
rule" prohibiting incumbent labor organizations from using
their nonemployee agents as election observers for
decertification elections. The board overturns a
decertification election despite the lack of any evidence of
misconduct by the union agent, citing neutrality of the
election process as the reason for its bright-line rule.

The board distinguishes decertification elections from
initial representation elections, in which nonemployee union
observers are allowed providing the agency does not engage
in misconduct and the agent's presence does not interfere
with any party's rights. "In our view, it is more likely
that an employee would be influenced by the presence of a
person who is an agent of a union that "is" his bargaining
representative than by a person who is an agent of a union
that wishes to "become" the bargaining representative." . .

FTC CLEARS AMAZON'S REVISED PRIVACY POLICY,  APPROVES
TRUSTE'S COPPA SAFE HARBOR PROGRAM

The Federal Trade Commission concludes that a change in
Amazon.com's online privacy policy concerning the
circumstances in which the company might disclose personal
information about its customers does not violate the FTC
Act. The FTC's conclusions are in response to a petition
alleging that the electronic retailer deceived consumers in
its representations about privacy of personal information. .

The Federal Trade Commission approves the safe harbor
program for children's online data proposed by TRUSTe, an
organization that grants privacy seals to Web sites. Firms
adhering to guidelines established by TRUSTe will be
presumed to be in compliance with regulations implementing
the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which require
that Web sites directed at children post comprehensive
privacy policies on their sites and obtain parental consent
before collecting personal information from children under
the age of 13.  . . . Page 2744

Of course not.  We really are only going to put the: (i) development 
documents (except the lease) and (ii) other publically available documents on 
deal bench (i.e. Interconnect Agreements, Feasibility Studies, etc.).

I only wanted you to have a heads up on what we had already provided TECO.  
Better to know was what I was thinking (even if it is after the fact).

Instinctively it seems that the agent for concept would be stronger.  I'll 
check into it for the  longer term deal.  Obviously, it is a Mississippi law

The following are my comments:

  - I assume that Settlements is fine with invoicing no later than the 7 th 
of each mth.
  - Section M:  Should we go this route (covenant of financial support) or 
would we be accomplishing the same if we structure this as MDEA, agent for 
..., similar to that in the Interconnection Agmt.  We should probably look 
into it further for the longer term deal.  I don't know which has the 
stronger fall back to the municipalities.

Hi Rebecca,

I'm trying to locate the sig pages for the NW guaranty.  These were the docs 
that I approved after I had approved the letter agreement.  These signed 
pages weren't with the letter agreements and change orders you brought me.  
To you remember if you brought them to me before?  I haven't really searched

GE and Enron tax folks (Dave and Matt) earlier today.

Steve - Please forward this Email to Dave (if necessary) as I do not have his 
Email address.

Matt - If you have any further comments to the revised text, please give John 
or myself a call so that we can include your thoughts in our conference call 
with GE tomorrow at 1:30 CST.

Ben,

I made a minor adjustment to the LOI re: exclusivity.    

 << File: Midway TECO LOI june 1.doc >> 

Policy states that any time we sign up to exclusivity we are supposed to get 
it approved by Mark Metts, Tim Detmering and the CEO of the affected business 
unit.  Seems a little silly in this case, but it can't hurt. (yes, I know we 
didn't do it with the turbine stuff)

Subject: Extension of ILA


I've taken the liberty of drafting a form of extension letter to extend the
ILA until June 15.

I suspect Reagan will be distributing to the commercial folks, but I
thought I would give you a heads up.

David, I'm at work on revising the longer term doc.  If you have your
preamble stuff ready, I'm happy to put it in now.

Thanks,

Kay

(See attached file: MDEA ILA extension May 29.doc)

PS  The salutation is to "Gentlemen".  Are the members of the commission
and MDEA all men?  I don't want to commit a blunder.

Folks,

Please include Kayne Coulter and Jeff Miller and Gerald Gilbert in all 
communications and discussions regarding MDEA. Kayne is the Account Manager 
and Jeff is his back-up.  Both have been intimitly involved in MDEA 
operations and will have invaluable input.  I am counting on Kayne to manage 
this deal for Services. Gerald is taking over for Jim Homko in managing our 
gas activities associated with all services deals and will have input on gas 
issues. 

Thanks,

Tom.

We need internal agreement on the cancellation fee schedule, to be included

What is the status of the Yazoo City master gas agreement?  Do we still want 
a master gas agreement for Clarksdale, also?  Do we want it now?

Thanks,

Subject: Open items for MDEA

Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of 
the agreement:


How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily 
average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?

Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?

We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?

We aren't making money on gas, right?

Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to 
the picture?

Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  

It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the 
following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) 
formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to 
work on.   Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost 
of power)?  How are we setting the bogey?  Formula?  Subject to audit? Two 
bogeys or one (gas and oil)?

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or 
two would be helpful as a reality check.  What costs are included on the buy 
and sell side?

Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split 
costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these 
questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

Thanks,

Kay

Here is a copy of the agreement, made all the more ugly by my redaction 
"surgery."

I have put some terms that you will want to think through carefully in 
italics.  I totally removed some other provisions that were particularly 
deal-specific (e.g. an obligation to offer to sell them the project if we 
decided to abandon it--I know, it's damn weird, but they were hung up on some 
strange things).

Let me know if I can answer any questions.

Did you get my email yesterday asking for a time to have a call with Rod and 
me?

>>> <Kay.Mann@enron.com> 06/06/01 08:09AM >>>

Wilson,

We are running short on time.  We are planning to sign on  Tuesday, and I
hesitate to put a new document in front of them at this late date. Would it
be easier to work with reps/warranties?

I definitely need an answer from your firm confirming (1) enforceability
(2) obligation of the Cities to financially support agreement.

Also, could you provide me with the Mississippi law defn of consequential
damages and a couple of examples where Enron could be responsible for same
under this agreement?  Also, can MDEA and the Cities be liableto Enron for
consequentials (absent a waiver)?

Your comments to the previously forwarded draft would be greatly
appreciated.

Kay

Wilson,

We are trying to finalize this transaction by next Tuesday, and I could
really use your help.  I believe you owe me a draft of an opinion letter?
Also, do you have any comments to the draft agreement I sent out last week?

I also need an opinion that the language in the agreement re the Cities
obligation to financially support MDEA is sufficient.

Thank you,

Avoid confusion?? What in the world does that mean? 

And along those lines, as I was archiving files last night in preparation for 
the move to the Enron building, I can across the resumes that you two sent to 
me when you applied for a job here.  After giving the matter due 
consideration, I have decided not to hire either of you.

Hi there.

I am attaching for the group's consideration a red line that I ran comparing 
the current working draft (v4) with the draft John R. recently circulated to 
Tax and Insurance. 

I suggest that Pete Thompson keep the typewriter on this.  We are getting so 
close to the end, I would really like to try to avoid confusion.  

I am also attaching a clean copy of the current active version, and the 
current list of issues under consideration.  I suggest we work through this 
list and turn another draft before soliciting Cris/Herman and Lisa's 
comments.  We should also give the ENA commercial reps the opportunity to 
review it at that time.


Kay

Kay,

I don't know the answer to your 1st question since I don't recall ever
having to have insurance certificates on any of the other Facility
Agreements.  Maybe we did, but I just forgot that detail.  Jaap/Kent? do you
know?

The Retention LC was faxed this am to Greg Lang and Isabell Parker.  Jaap's
Admin Asst can fax you a copy (Carla Corly) if you wish.

Also, need to talk about Austin Tech reps being added to Facility Agreement
asap (Mike Storm says they've worked out 1700 hours with Eric Booth).  But
we need something in the interim that confirms this will be added into the
Austin Facility Agreement (e-mail to me OK).

Regards,

Lee

I haven't seen the insurance certificate she references.  Anyone know where
it is?

Is the retention letter of credit available yet? I know it has been
requested, but I don't recall seeing that it has been delivered.

Thanks for everything,

Kay

Kay,


I Hope you had a good weekend. I do again have email (I'm back in Miami).

Regarding the Plat for the Midway project property, I'd rather use Ben that 
Dave to sign the Plat which will be filed during the construction period.  
Would his title be "Attorney-in-Fact"?

Regarding Certosa Holdings,  I would like to discuss the benefits and issues 
of throwing Certosa Holdings into bankruptcy.  Are you available to discuss 
later today?

Greg

Hi Greg,

I just wanted to mention that if we are going to bust the percentage rule on 
the option payment, there is no incremental damage in having the option 
payment credited to the purchase price of the land.

As for officers of the development company, I would use Dave Duran.  Ben 
holds a power of attorney, but isn't an officer.

Hope you get email!

The bank will issue the LOC by the end of next week, perhaps as early as
Wednesday.  We are using E-Next Generation LLC as the beneficiary.  The LOC
will be mailed to you.  Do you still require a Lien Waiver?

Also, do you want new invoices?  If so, will one for $1,502,355 be
sufficient?

   I will get you re-established on PNet, with the correct e-mail address..
   For the B&V folks, I need names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers,
   (nice,
   but not required).

   Just a reminder, the site change process can not start until the new
   site
   conditions are identified to GE.  The cost and cycle estimate then takes
   about 4 weeks.

Subject: Interface with Accounting and Global Finance

Guys:

As you all know, our group is in the middle of a very significant amount of 
development and equipment book management activity, This hard work by all of 
you has allowed us to achieve very impressive income results thus far this 
year, and has set the stage for continued success. It has also placed 
significant demands on internal resources that are integral to our success, 
in particular those resources in Global Finance, Accounting, and Legal. 

In order to ensure a proper prioritization of work flow, and that project 
specific objectives and time lines are communicated, I need each of you to 
come to me with all new agreements prior to seeking input from Accounting and 
Global Finance. I will interface with these two groups and establish 
priorities for their review.

We will continue to refine how we interface with these groups, and as such, 
I'd appreciate any suggestions you would have. I plan to have a staff meeting 
next week, and we can discuss it at that time.

Thanks,

Ben

So, based on the forgoing, assuming we can not and do not buy the property 
until the LLC is owned by ENext then the terms of the POA docs should have no 
balance sheet impact.  Do you agree?

Correct.  If all we were doing was buying the property, you wouldn't have the 
timing restriction.  You lose one layer of optionality.

So if we buy the property before the LLC is owned by ENext the entire project 
goes on the balance sheet since we will be committed to building a road and 
stormwater system.  There we all must be aware that we can not close on the 
property until the LLC is owned by ENext.  Do you agree?

Put the land on the balance sheet is a forgiveable sin.  Incurring any other 
type of  hard costs puts the entire project (whatever that may be) on the 
balance sheet.

If we buy the property before the LLC is owned by ENext, wouldn't the big 
concern be that we've put $1.8 million of land plus an additional $900,000 or 
so of obligations to build road and stormwater system on the balance rather 
than the rather small ongoing costs related to maintainance of the road and 
system?

As I understand it, if the option is exercised (and the property bought) 
prior to the time the LLC is owned by ENext, there is a balance sheet 
impact.

Probable time for them to bless the agreements; however, since these 
documents will not be executed until after closing, the obligations created 
under the Property Owners Association should not have a balance sheet impact.

Kay,

A&K did the title committment work and is now working on the Property 
Association Documents (as is Greenberg Traurig in West Palm Beach).  Ann 
Elizabeth's
last email message to me before she went on vacation was that A&K was the 
designated hitter for the Midway Project.    You have been copied on those 
docs which we desparately need to get to Cooney Midway Groves, the property 
owner.  As far as I know, they have not been involved in anything else 
related to Midway this year.

Christi left me a message saying that Lloyd Will or one of his guys needs to 
review the Interconnction Agreement. I do not know Lloyd.

Greg

PS we had a good meeting with DERM on the landfill closure issues in the 
Certosa Holdings deal.   I'll try to reach you this afternoon to discuss.

and he will be sending us those comments today in a marked document. Have we 
engaged outside counsel to review this agreement? I'd like to have a 
commercial / legal review fully completed, and then get accounting / finance 
to comment. I this something you were planning to have Carlos to work on 
given his recent work on ComEd and Ameren?

Please let me know. Thanks.

You'll also be even more proud to know the outcome of the following text that 
I sent to one of my Mexico clients -- "Matthew, with all due respect, clients 
will be doing business with Enron as it is indentified in the introductory 
paragraph and the signature block.  Indeed, as a side note, most of  the 
documents that I have drafted or reviewed always use some form of acronym for 
subsequent references to Enron.  I am indifferent, but I know that the reason 
our accounting brethen made that comment, as well as the other comments they 
often make that seem counter-intuitive, is that it facilitates their efforts 
in ensuring that documents reflect off-balance sheet, soft costs related 
rather than on-balance sheet, hard costs.  As such, I would defer to them on 
this issue"  which was in response to "Carlos, with all due respect to our 
Accounting brethren, from a commercial point of view, potential clients don't 
want to do business with EDM, they want to do business with Enron.  So, 
please switch the EDM thing back to Enron and everything will be fine."  
Anyway, I think Herman must have forwarded  copy of those emails to Lisa who 
shared it with Joe Deffner and I happened to run into them outside just now 
and they were both congratulating me for my "toughness".  

By separate email, I'll forward you a redlined form of interconnect agreement 
that we can subsequently discuss.

Fred / Kay:

I spoke to Duran this morning, and he and I would like to meet together with 
us to discuss the Midway project and whether or not we will be able to 
utilize TurboPark Phase 2. I previously told him that because of timing 
considerations and because there may be certain agreements that will be 
difficult to make TurboPark compliant (such as the attached interconnect 
agreement from FPL), that Phase 2 may not be practical for purposes of this 
project.

I think this would be a good discussion to have on Friday, because we should 
have more information on the GE7FAs and should have already spoken with TECO 
on their proposed MOU (and maybe even the tolling agreement). What are your 
schedules on Friday?

I also would like to schedule a call for tomorrow with TECO to go over the 
MOU. Fred - Please coordinate with Kay and schedule something with Becky 
Alex. I would prefer the afternoon if that's OK with you guys, and would like 
45 min. before the call for us to meet seperately. Also Fred, please advise 
on the status of the tolling agreement.

Kay - attached is FPL's standard form interconnect agreement. I was thinking 
that Carlos would be a good choice to review it as he is currently working 
with accounting / finance on an Ameren interconnect, so he will already be 
familiar with the likely issues. Please let me know what you think. It will 
be important to give Duran a summary of likely accounting / finance issues 
related to this agreement on Friday. 

Hope you both had good weekends.

Ben

Ben

The way we actually paid the invoices changed slightly after Chris had sent 
the letter to GE.  We deducted the LD's and the retention amount from the 
April 25th invoice (since the May invoice was not due until May 25th).

On May 8th, a wire totalling $1,671,039 was sent to GE -- this represented 
$469,000 for the c/o #2 invoice and $1,202,039 for the April 25th invoice 
less the LD's and retention.

To respond to Jeff Darst's letter, we can say that we are planning on paying 
the May 25th invoice in full (assuming we're not planning on deducting 
additional LD's for May 8-May 25).  

We just need to clarify with Jeff that both the LD and the retention were 
deducted from the April invoice, and then we can deal with resolving the 
issues he discusses in his letter.

Regards,
Rebecca

Kay:

Can you get executed documents back to me on Tuesday?  Greg has requested
that we send the original membership certificate representing the 80%
interest to the collateral agent Tuesday night by overnight delivery to hold
in escrow until closing, in order that the collateral agent is in possession
of the certificate (for purposes of legal opinions) upon closing on
Wednesday.  Greg is planning to fax signature pages of all of their closing
documents later today.  (I will be out of the office at a meeting with
another client most of the afternoon today).

There is one last question with GE dealing with the letter of credit for the
retention amount, as this affects our disbursement instruction letter.  I
advised Greg that GE's normal practice was to send the retention L/C after
receipt of payment.  He is considering this, but may want to talk to GE
about the ability to present the L/C at closing.  Do you have any thoughts
on this?

I have gone through the Version 3 of the ABB agreement that you forwarded. I 
have compared it to the other versions and changes I was aware of (the 
technical areas only). I have attached a red-lined version with edits. Also, 
here are my notes on each of the changes:

Section 5.1 of the Agreement - earlier versions of the Agreement contained 
the purchase amount here. As I commented by phone, by my calculation the 
total purchase amount for these two units would be $1,713,000.00, or 
$856,500.00 each. By my records, the original purchase amount for these units 
was $782,000.00. A change was made in November 2000 that increased each unit 
by $49,500.00. Another change in December 2000 increased each unit by 
$25,000.00. These increase amounts were confirmed by ABB on 11/28/00 and 
12/18/00. The Version 3 document eliminates this purchase amount.. However, 
sections 6.1.2 and 6.1.3 contain amounts of $78,200.00, 10% on the original 
purchase amount of one unit. Should these values be changed?

Exhibit B1:
Section 5.1.2 b) and c) - these are revisions requested by the contractor. 
They are reasonable requests if they can be accommodated by ABB. I don not 
know if these changes were coordinated directly between the contractor and 
ABB.

Section 9.1 - minimum ambient temperature
Minimum ambient temperature should be minus 5 degrees C. This corresponds to 
23 degrees F, the design basis temperature. The minus 13.3 degrees C 
requested by the contractor is incorrect.

Section 9.5.5 - Surge Arrestor rating
This is a new request from the contractor. It appears acceptable.

Section 10 - Voltage Rating
This is a correction to indicate a voltage of 138,000

Section 10 - Type of Cooling
This is added information on type of cooling (FOA) as provided by ABB in 
thier revised data sheets.

The other changes in Sections 9 and 10 correspond to information previously 
provided to ABB in conference calls and communications from the contractor.

It's been a while since the last e-mail, so thought I'd bring you up to
date.

Michael was back in the hospital for a week, starting Good Friday, with an
infection/flu.  He's pretty much recovered from that, but the net result was
that the bone marrow transplant has been delayed  because of his condition.
His white cells (the infection fighters) are down, so he needs a boost in
their count.  Once they're up to an acceptable level, and everything else is
OK, the transplant process will start.

The marrow was taken from the donor last Thursday, the 3rd.  The report is
that it's healthy marrow.  It's now in a freezer, waiting for Michael to be
able to receive it.

Sheila/Kay-

Would either of you please give me a call at your earliest convenience.  I 
urgently need to write a change order for the LM6000 contract with S&S/GE for 
some additional TDofI hours so that they don't pull the plug on me in the 
field (or at least that's what they're threatening to do).  

Please call me at x54683.  If you don't get in touch with me today, I will be 
in Austin tomorrow and can be reached at (713) 412-6873 (c).

Carolyn confirmed that she did not use the Citibank form of Incumbency
Certificate and that her certificate did not include language requiring a
seal.  Should we go ahead and modify the language on the Citibank form?  If
so, I propose using the following language: "IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have
hereunto set my hand as Managing Director of the Company this ____ day of
June, 2001."

With respect to CO#2, we have incorporated your final changes. Please find
attached a marked and clean (i.e. executable) copy. At your earliest

e-mail me the signed copy.

I will call you first thing in the morning.

Marchris,

I am getting ready to request a wire transfer in the amount of $7,500 to be 
paid to Albert Lorenzo with Quantum Results, Inc. in connection with the 
Consulting  Services Agreement we have with him.

Please advise if your department has already taken care of this payment 
and/or confirm that you want me to take care of this payment.

Thank you.

Subject: Consulting Agreements with lobbyists
Importance: High

As you know, in the last few months we have had discussions regarding the 
retention of lobbyists to perform services on our Florida Power Development 
Projects.  It was decided that we would have the lobbyists retained through 
the Government Affairs group.  Two recent agreements, one with Quantum 
Results and another with Tripp, Scott, provided for payments to be made at 
certain junctures of our development process.  It has come to our attention 
that these payments were not timely made.   In order to make sure that we 
don't inadvertently miss any future payments, I am proposing that:

1.  We continue to retain the consultants through execution of a consulting 
services agreement signed by Government Affairs.  The consulting agreements 
will be prepared in duplicate originals so that the lobbyist keeps one copy 
and Enron keeps one copy.

2.  Legal will retain Enron's executed original and provide it to Kay Young, 
who maintains a database of all consulting agreements and confidentiality 
agreements entered into by ENA entities.

3.  Legal will distribute a copy of the executed document to government 
affairs for their records.

4.  Legal will distribute a copy of the executed document to Kathleen 
Carnahan who will set up a payment schedule.  Unlike our real property option 
agreements that have a date certain for payment, these agreements often have 
payment schedules dependent upon some approval process.  Thus, it will be 
important for all of us to keep Kathleen in the loop as to dates of hearings 
or approvals so that she will know if it is time for a payment.

5.  Kathleen will provide notices to government affairs that a payment is 
due, and the amount of the payment and arrange for reimbursement of such 
payment out of the development group's RC.

6.  Government affairs will make the payments and be reimbursed out of the 
development group's RC.  

Please advise if this system will work for you so that we can undertake to 
have Kathleen begin setting up a payment schedule.

My strong preference is that we continue to keep things flowing through the 
government affairs group so that we consistently maintain the lobbyist 
relationship.  However, this will require government affairs have some way of 
monitoring the agreements.  I think we fix that problem with having Kathleen 
keep a consultant schedule just as she keeps an option schedule.

I'm going on vacation as of next Wednesday so your response by Tuesday will 
be greatly appreciated.

Ad valorems do not necessarily decrease as a result of depreciation, because 
millage rates and a current years reassessment also are part of the 
calculation. 

Have they asked for this?

We wanted to maintain a recurring 1.5mm and since ad advalorems will
decrease as a function of depreciation we thought the way to maintain the
constant we to increase the 650k at the same rate as the depreciation.

Thanks for your support.  We checked into the matching, but unfortunately 
since the group raising this money was not formed as a Charitable 
Organization under the tax reg's, the ability to get Enron to match is not 
availible.  The goal of each golfer is to raise at least $1000 towards the 
$150K goal, and your donation puts me over the $1K bar.

Thanks again.

Fred

Enron Golfers:

Hey guys, Sarah Edwards is a friend of a friend's daughter who desperately 
needs help to stay alive and all you duffers out there can help:

The 100 holes for golf for Sarah Edwards will be Monday June 4 at
Sweetwater CC. Sarah needs a lung transplant and
approximately $150,000 of the costs are not covered by insurance or
medicaid.  

For more info on Sarah, visit Sarahssoldiers.com 

Here is how the 100 holes for golf works:

*Free golf at Sweetwater
*You play as many holes as you can (100 is not mandatory)
* We provide your lunch, drinks and snacks
* You get pledges from your friends to play
*pledges may be flat amounts, per hole, per birdie or per eagle

Lets all keep Sarah alive! Can I get some other tentative commitments?

thanks!

Steve

Rose,

JOhn is in Brazil, but he promised he would do a reality check calculation 
for the LM6000 price if we could send him the equipment list for the third 
party sale.  

John will need the equipment list, and a copy of the section which describes 
the sales price.     Any possibility of getting that before you guys head out 
to San Antonio for the legal conference?    Thanks.

25 years ago for me (Shayne is 25 today).  Time files.  She was babysitting 
yesterday and had to take the little girl (3 years old) to the emergency room 
because she stepped on some glass.  Apparently is was not a real big deal, 
but I think it was her first ordeal of the kind.

Re: sleeping on backs, I still don't understand that one.  I always thought 
they were to sleep on their stomachs to avoid choaking if they threw up.

Did you do anything fun this weekend?  We just puttered around the house and 
I worked on PRC's yesterday. Next weekend the kayaks are coming out come hell 
or high water!

This stuff is so much better than it was 20 years ago.  It is amazing how 
things have changed.  

Did you know that they now tell you to have  babies sleep on their backs?  
That is totally different from when Paige was a baby.  It was hard to get 
used to.

I will be in Houston tomorrow, and have a call in to Paul Pippitone (?) and 
Peter Thompson to pin down where we are and what needs to be done.  I will 
try to pull Rose into that meeting as well.

Assuming we don't get everything resolved at that meeting, Bill has suggested 
(appropriately, I think) that we should have a follow-on all-hands meeting 
next week in Houston with GE as well.  Thursday has been proposed.

I'm on the phone with GE.  Their initial response to the assignment stuff is

what we are doing on payment.

I've been working on TECO term sheet, but I'm not sure I'll be done by 300,

Attached is a revised draft of the lease agreement both as a clean copy and 
red line comparison to the draft that you sent.  I would be glad to explain 
the reasons behind the changes included.  The changes in the insurance 
section are taken from the input of our insurance department.
To answer your other question Andrew Balog at Greenberg is not a relative but 
we are both Hungarian.  I don't run across many with that name especially 
outside of the northeast and midwest.

Michael today?  Sorry for the short notice, but the two people who were
going to do it today "bailed" for various reasons.

If you're able to donate today, please call my wife, Bev, at 713 972-6840.

Subject: Greene Option - Pontiac Site

Kathleen,

I have spoken with Mr. Greene's attorney - Ed Legner - and let him know that 
his minor suggested changes for the one year extension of the Pontiac site 
option were acceptable.  I indicated that we would send out originals for 
review and execution this week.

The procedure we agreed to was as follows:

We will send originals to Ed Legner in Pontiac for his review and initials.
He will forward to Dick Greene in Florida for execution.
Dick will sign and send to us
We execute and return their original along with the the two checks in the 
amount of $5000 each - one for exercise of the six month extension, and the 
other for making our requested changes for turbopark compliance and for 
granting an additional 12 month extension option at the end of this year.

I would like to get this inked as soon as possible in order to ensure the 
viability of the Pontiac site for a 2003 COD.

I agree as to the original deliverables.  However, for the GE Turbine
Contract, an officer of the LLC who is named on the Secretary's certificate
(i.e., Duran, Calger or Thomas) should sign.  Just to be safe, we may also
want the M/D of the LLC who is named on the Secretary's certificate (i.e.,
Duran) to sign the LLC membership certificates.

Will you be sending the originals to me to forward to Freshfields and Paul
Hastings?

Here's what I have on my list as original deliverables

GE turbine contract - any officer of LLC
Amended LLC- any officer of ENA
Membership certificates - signed by MD of LLC, which isn't Jake

The only things I have which MUST be signed by Jake are the written
consents of the LLC, which aren't on the original deliverable list.  These
will be ready first thing Wednesday am.

I'm sorry,  I don't recall you telling me that the original membership
certificates had to be in New York on Wednesday. However, we will be able
to handle this.

This pre-closing drill is why I asked for a definitive, signed off  closing
list by mid-day Friday.

It won't be a big deal if we can get these documents into Federal Express
Tuesday night for delivery Wednesday as indicated below.  If there is a
chance that Jake will be late so as to miss the Fed Ex deadline, then we
need to make alternative arrangements for signature.  Otherwise Paul
Hastings will be forced to renegotiate its legal opinion with Freshfields,
and we owe them the courtesy of letting them know this first thing Tuesday
morning, as I indicated to them as early as Thursday of last week that we
had no objection to getting at least the original membership certificate to
them by overnight delivery prior to closing to hold in escrow until the
closing, in order to satisfy opinion issues associated with perfection of
the lien on the membership interest.  Please let me know.  Thanks.

As soon as I get back to the office, I will re-check the Salmon resolutions
electing officers to confirm Chris Calger's title with Salmon and will let
you know.

I think we will be able to get the documents you listed signed tomorrow,
but Jake won't be here before 7pm, so anything he is signing won't be ready
until Wednesday am.  It seems to me that this isn't a big deal, but I would
appreciate it if you could confirm.

The original membership certificate for the 80% interest should be

for delivery on Wednesday, May 2, to the following address:

Ms. Isabel Parker
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP
520 Madison Avenue, 34th Floor
New York, NY  10022

(Greg has asked that the membership certificate be faxed to him (fax

with the overnight courier).

If you will also be sending the original signature pages to the Turbine

be forwarded for delivery on Wednesday, May 2, to:

Mr. Gregory F. Lang
Paul Hastings Janofsky & Walker LLP
1055 Washington Blvd.

Please confirm absolutely that fax signatures will be sufficient.

I need the address of where to send the membership certificate.  There is
not enough time for the document to pass back through Houston if the

delivery for Wednesday.  It must be an original, in that the lender's lien
on the membership interest is not perfected without possession of the
original certificate.  With respect to the remaining documents, fax copies
of signature pages on the closing date should be sufficient.

The problem is in getting the original in their hands (where?) by tomorrow.
Does it have to be an original?

Kay:

Can we at least get the membership certificates signed by Tuesday?  This
seems to be the only document required in advance of closing.  If we can't
get the 80% membership interest certificate in the lender's possession on
the closing date, then there is a lien perfection issue for them to deal
with, and I thought we could accommodate their request and avoid the
problem
altogether.  Please advise, as Greg and Isabel will be calling within an
hour or so to finalize the mechanics on this.  Thanks.

I've asked GE for the LOC by Wednesday, but I haven't gotten a response.

I'll have difficulty getting executed docs by Tuesday, since sigs are
coming from Portland.  I'll have to check to see what can be done.

Can you get executed documents back to me on Tuesday?  Greg has requested
that we send the original membership certificate representing the 80%
interest to the collateral agent Tuesday night by overnight delivery to
hold
in escrow until closing, in order that the collateral agent is in
possession
of the certificate (for purposes of legal opinions) upon closing on
Wednesday.  Greg is planning to fax signature pages of all of their closing
documents later today.  (I will be out of the office at a meeting with
another client most of the afternoon today).

There is one last question with GE dealing with the letter of credit for
the
retention amount, as this affects our disbursement instruction letter.  I
advised Greg that GE's normal practice was to send the retention L/C after
receipt of payment.  He is considering this, but may want to talk to GE
about the ability to present the L/C at closing.  Do you have any thoughts
on this?

The message below is related to Fort Pierce.  I have only reviewed the 
Participation Agreement for a Confidentiality provision (Section 18.1).  I 
think Bart also told me that there is a confidentiality provision in either 
the Option Agreement or the Lease.  I will look around.

Attached below are the latest docs. on Fort Pierce.  Please note that we are 
still awaiting some final comments from FPUA's attorney and Turbopark, but 
these should be very close to final form.  We should have all comments back 
and be in final form in a week to ten days if you want to wait to put the 
docs. into Deal bench.

Bart sent this e-mail out in response to Lisa Bill's request for a 
comprehensive list of all documents.  I think the only document missing is 
the FMPA steam agreement where we can use their units on an interruptible 
basis when they are not using them.  Please note that some of the documents 
are not for parties outside of Enron are confidential legal opinions.

As requested today, attached are the latest drafts of the FPUA/FPRP 
Development Agreements to be executed by FPUA and FPRP and the Tax and 
Aesthetics Agreements to be executed by the City of Fort Pierce and FPRP  ( 
to be delivered to FPRP at the execution of the other Development Agreements 
by FPUA). It may be helpful to open the Execution Date Deliveries document 
first to give you a checklist of the documents, and a rundown on permits. If 
you need an update on permitting, I will have to ask Scott and Jeffrey to 
help with that discussion. Note that the Equipment Lease for the chillers, 
the Equipment Lease for the cooling towers, and the Option to Lease for the 
cooling tower site ( and the Ground Lease, which will be appended to the 
Option to Lease) are in the process of being drafted now, and I will 
distribute them as soon as they are ready. DO NOT DISTRIBUTE THIS MEMO OR THE 
ATTACHED MEMO FROM A & k TO FPUA OR ANYONE OUTSIDE ENRON, AS THE CERTIFICATES 
TO BE DELIVERED IN CONNECTION WITH THE OPINIONS ARE STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL TO 
FPRP/ENRON.

In connection with our meeting Friday, a couple of other points worth noting 
are (1) Section 9.2 (c) of the Participation Agreement, added as a 
placeholder when the thought was to have a dump condenser and when its 
location was unknown,will be deleted, (2) references in Exhibits D and E to 
the dump condenser/system will be removed, references in Exhibit  D 
describing the FPRP Improvements will add references to the cooling tower and 
chillers, and references in Exhibit E to the demin system will remain. 

There are additional comments received from FPUA and its insurance 
consultants after preparation of the attached draft of the Participation 
Agreement , all of which have been blessed by David Marshall, that will be 
addressed in the next draft. 

We also know that the legal description and plot plan of the leased parcel in 
the Ground Lease will change to reflect the extension of the parcel 30' to 
the east, certain easements in favor of FPUA and FPRP described in the Ground 
Lease and the Easement Agreement will be affected by the extension,and we 
should have those descriptions and plans for the lease parcel description and 
affected easements tomorrow. 

We also have internal input from David Fairley ( Interconnection & 
Transmission), Mike Coleman ( Section 3.12, O & M, Annual Heat Rate Test ), 
Jeffrey Keenan ( Tolling and Interconnection & Transmission Agreement), and 
Rusty/Ron Tapscott ( Section 9.3, Participation Agreement, Transmission 
Upgrades Responsibilities) that needs to be reflected. 

Finally, note that the proposed FPRP and ENA legal opinion, and related FPRP 
Certificate, is being discussed by Rose with E-Next counsel, and we 
understand those documents will change based on those discussions.

As noted today, FPUA will give us its comments on the documents delivered to 
them on 5/9 this Friday, but we don't expect those comments to be material. 
We also don't expect there to be much discussion about the items noted above 
to be added to the last drafts seen by FPUA, except possible with respect to 
the Equipment Leases and Option to Lease, which will be new documents they 
have to review.

Hi Gerry,

I don't remember anyone signing a notice of lien in Arizona.  I remember
seeing a bunch of lien notices, since they have to send a notice even if
payment isn't due yet.  I always thought that was strange, and sure created
clutter.  I can't remember if there was any requirement that we sign.  Does
Dewey remember?  If you didn't sign and Dewey didn't sign, that doesn't
leave many folks who would have done so.  I guess they could have changed
the laws, though.   Sorry I'm not more help.  I've forgotten more than I've
remembered.

If you are near town this evening, we are celebrating Paige's 21st birthday
at Keneally's, staring around 7.  I'll buy.  I can't  believe she is 21.
Very disruptive of my self-perception.

Ciao,

Kay

Hello Kay---

I need some free legal advice and you are my favorite attorney.  I'll buy
you a drink as payment in kind.

Try and remember El Paso work in Arizona.  Arizona has statue that says you
must make a twenty day preliminary notice to file a lien.  If you don't
file
such notice you waive your right to ever file a lien.  I remember this from
our previous work out there.

We have a vendor who is supplying services to one of our subcontractors.
He
has sent us a twenty day notice to file a lien.  There is no dispute but he
is sending the notice anyway.  I understand all of that.

My question is this----it asks for us (BE&K) to sign and acknowledge
receipt
of the notice.  It doesn't exactly read like I am required to acknowledge
receipt.  What do you think or remember?  Am I required to sign the notice
or not.  Minor point I know, but I'd rather not raise the flag in
Birmingham.

Thanks.  I really just want to hear from you and this is all I could come
up
with for an excuse to write.

Gerry Turner

Of course not.  We really are only going to put the: (i) development

I only wanted you to have a heads up on what we had already provided TECO.

This is just too funny not to pass along!  Have a great weekend!


Subject: Three Kick Rule 

A big city lawyer went duck hunting in South Louisiana. He shot and 
dropped a bird, but it fell into a farmer's field on the other 
side of a fence. 

As the lawyer climbed over the fence, an elderly farmer drove up on? his 
tractor and asked him what he was doing. The litigator responded, "I shot a 
duck and it fell in this field, and now I'm going in to retrieve it." 

The old farmer replied. "This is my property, and you are not 
coming over here." 

The indignant lawyer said, "I am one of the best trial attorneys in the U.S. 
and, if you don't let me get that duck, I'll sue you and 
take everything you own." 

The old farmer smiled and said, "Apparently, you don't know how we do things 
in Louisiana. We settle small disagreements like this with the Louisiana 
Three Kick Rule." 

The lawyer asked, "What is the Louisiana Three Kick Rule?" 

The Farmer replied. "Well, first I kick you three times and then you kick me 
three times, and so on, back and forth, until someone gives up." 

The attorney quickly thought about the proposed contest and decided that he 
could easily take the old codger. He agreed to abide by the local custom. The 
old farmer slowly climbed down from the tractor and 
walked up to the city feller. His first kick planted the toe of his heavy 
work boot into the lawyer's groin and dropped him to his knees. His second 
kick nearly ripped the man's nose off his face. The barrister was flat on his 
belly when the farmer's third kick to a kidney nearly caused him to give up. 

The lawyer summoned every bit of his will and managed to get 
to his feet and said, "Okay, you old coot now it's my turn." 

(I love this part......) 

The old farmer smiled and said, "Naw, I give up. You can have 
the duck."

Kay -- Before the agreement and your risk letter are finished, I want to ask 
again that we focus on those particular items remaing in the agreement that 
may create incremental risk, and would lead to a worse risk rating in your 
risk letter.  If you would pinpoint those items, then we can discuss them to 
be sure that we get language in the agreement to mitigate those risks.  With 
your knowledge of the law and ability to craft language into the agreement, 
and my knowledge of the utility business and power trading, I think that we 
can improve most or all of these risk issues.  In addition, the MDEA deal is 
becoming a template for all similar deals, so anything that we can take care 
of in this agreement will flow through to other deals.  Thanks -- David

Kay,

We are starting to run into some scheduling constraints for next week, at 
least with Bob Priest.  I'd like to get together with Bob and Marvin early 
next week to discuss the agreement--moving toward finalizing before June 12.  
Bob is only available Monday.  Bob and Marvin think it is a good ideal to 
then meet with RW Beck.

I'd like to email Marvin and Bob the next version sometime today?

Never stayed there.  My current favorite is the Omni, which is in one of may 
favorite locations. It has a little deli like shop across the street, where I 
can buy reasonably priced bagels, cokes, etc.  Last year I also stayed at the 
Marriott Marquis (BIG, right on Times Square) and the Mark (too snooty).  I 
stayed two other places I didn't like, but the names escape me.

I've seen some other smaller hotels which look nice, and if I check a map I 
might remember the names.

I have involved Andy Edison, one of ENA's litigation managers, in reviewing 
our potential claims against Westinghouse with respect to the "wet" turbine 
and the general issue of whether we have any type of "duty to mitigate" the 
expense of the cost of the replacement generator (ie, whether we have a duty 
to purchase the replacement generator at $3 mm since its cost might go up.)  
Andy has some interesting thoughts and questions, including why we aren't 
pressing Westinghouse harder with our claim and aren't pressing them harder 
to hold their price on the replacement generator for a longer time period 
given their potential exposure to us (arguably we might have a duty to 
mitigate the expense associated with the replacement generator if we have a 
reasonable basis for believing that the cost might go up).  Since there are 
no black and white answers, it probably would be useful to have a meeting to 
discuss our thoughts and address questions that we and you all may have.  
Please let me know your availability to meet either this week or early next.  
Lastly, Andy has noted that under our insurance policy we need to bring a 
lawsuit against the insurance carrier if they to fail resolve our claim 
before July 2001.  The practical impact of this is that we need to prepare a 
letter agreement whereby we and the insurance company agree to extend that 
time period.  Andy has recently prepared such a letter with respect to 
another claim and has agreed to prepare one for this claim as well.  Thanks.

Ben,

I made a minor adjustment to the LOI re: exclusivity.    

 << File: Midway TECO LOI june 1.doc >> 

Policy states that any time we sign up to exclusivity we are supposed to get 
it approved by Mark Metts, Tim Detmering and the CEO of the affected business 
unit.  Seems a little silly in this case, but it can't hurt. (yes, I know we 
didn't do it with the turbine stuff)

and also that you would be leaving to go celebrate your daughter's birthday a

Kay, I called Cingular to see what was up with your bill.  The last payment 
was made the end of March.  Your credit card expired March, 2001.  So, you 
are not set up currently for your credit card to be charged.  I'm going to go 
ahead and expense this charge and then you'll need to pay it.  If you want it 
set up again on your credit card, you have to send Cingular a letter stating 
your wishes.

I also changed your address to this building while I had her on the phone.

Is all of this ok with you?>

Subject: SWPC 501D5A Generator Damager onboard M/V:  INDUSTRIAL BRIDGE

Have just talked with adjuster again, and she has preliminary verbal report 
from surveyor who says that drawings merely confirm his prior contention that 
this generator was NOT a total loss at the time of the loss, but that further 
inspection of the unit would be necessary to prove otherwise.  

The comments from Andrew Edison about pressing SWPC on their responsibilities 
and ownership of the unit, this has previously been expressed by the adjuster 
to Jim Bouillion.  She definitely would like to have a sit down meeting with 
Enron people only, not SWPC at this time,  to discuss options and where we go 
from here.  She still hasn't signed the CA, but that is not necessary as she 
is not looking at the drawings and looking at them by her is not necessary 
for the purpose of a meeting with Enron.  

I did not check her availability for a meeting at this time because my 
schedule for Mon-Tues is still up in the air, and Jim Bouillion has a Mon-Wed 
meeting with our captive insurer in Vermont and would not be available before 
Thursday.  Do we collectively want to go forward with the sit down meeting 
with the adjuster, and if yes, who all needs to be involved and what are 
their availabilities?

Concerning the VALUE of the generator, the declared value of the entire 
shipment was $24,506,000.  There is no breakdown on the paperwork I have (or 
the broker) that puts a separate value on just the generator.  Thus I guess 
someone either has that or SWPC can provide that information.  The policy is 
not a "replacement cost value"  policy nor an "actual cash value" policy, but 
a "valued" policy.  What that means is we get paid what ever we declared the 
value to be CIF + 10%.  Hence the need to know what part of the $24,506,000 
is the "value" of the generator.

I await further instructions as to how you want to proceed.

It won't be a big deal if we can get these documents into Federal Express
Tuesday night for delivery Wednesday as indicated below.  If there is a
chance that Jake will be late so as to miss the Fed Ex deadline, then we
need to make alternative arrangements for signature.  Otherwise Paul
Hastings will be forced to renegotiate its legal opinion with Freshfields,
and we owe them the courtesy of letting them know this first thing Tuesday
morning, as I indicated to them as early as Thursday of last week that we
had no objection to getting at least the original membership certificate to
them by overnight delivery prior to closing to hold in escrow until the
closing, in order to satisfy opinion issues associated with perfection of
the lien on the membership interest.  Please let me know.  Thanks.

As soon as I get back to the office, I will re-check the Salmon resolutions
electing officers to confirm Chris Calger's title with Salmon and will let

I think we will be able to get the documents you listed signed tomorrow,
but Jake won't be here before 7pm, so anything he is signing won't be ready
until Wednesday am.  It seems to me that this isn't a big deal, but I would

Ms. Isabel Parker
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP
520 Madison Avenue, 34th Floor

with the overnight courier).

If you will also be sending the original signature pages to the Turbine

not enough time for the document to pass back through Houston if the

The original membership certificate needs to be in the lender's hands
(i.e.,
Isabel Parker's office) on Wednesday in order to release escrow.  If you
have the original to me by Tuesday, I can forward it to Isabel by overnight
delivery for Wednesday.  It must be an original, in that the lender's lien
on the membership interest is not perfected without possession of the
original certificate.  With respect to the remaining documents, fax copies
of signature pages on the closing date should be sufficient.

Can we at least get the membership certificates signed by Tuesday?  This
seems to be the only document required in advance of closing.  If we can't
get the 80% membership interest certificate in the lender's possession on
the closing date, then there is a lien perfection issue for them to deal
with, and I thought we could accommodate their request and avoid the
problem
altogether.  Please advise, as Greg and Isabel will be calling within an

Can you get executed documents back to me on Tuesday?  Greg has requested
that we send the original membership certificate representing the 80%
interest to the collateral agent Tuesday night by overnight delivery to
hold
in escrow until closing, in order that the collateral agent is in
possession
of the certificate (for purposes of legal opinions) upon closing on
Wednesday.  Greg is planning to fax signature pages of all of their closing
documents later today.  (I will be out of the office at a meeting with
another client most of the afternoon today).

There is one last question with GE dealing with the letter of credit for
the
retention amount, as this affects our disbursement instruction letter.  I
advised Greg that GE's normal practice was to send the retention L/C after
receipt of payment.  He is considering this, but may want to talk to GE
about the ability to present the L/C at closing.  Do you have any thoughts
on this?

I don't have any recollection of where we left the escrow agreement with
NW.  Please get with MKahn or Jerry DeBerry to see if we can get consensus
on the current form of escrow agreement.  Once we have that, Enron (Chris)
will make contact with Citibank.

Of course not.  We really are only going to put the: (i) development 
documents (except the lease) and (ii) other publically available documents on 
deal bench (i.e. Interconnect Agreements, Feasibility Studies, etc.).

I only wanted you to have a heads up on what we had already provided TECO.  
Better to know was what I was thinking (even if it is after the fact).

Most of the gifts will be coming from that little department (even the 
fishing reel has the Enron logo on it).  The only thing that is logo-less is 
the saddle, and our developers would like to find someone to tool the Logo on 
it.

That reminds me.  There used to be a "gift department" that blessed such 
things.  I don't remember where it is - PR?  I wonder who would know?

I can't wait to use the "baby Carnahan" things!  It makes me excited just to 
think about it.  And funny you would mention the last name thing because I 
was just thinking about that last night.  The father's name is Dustin Elkins, 
but I doubt they will get married (at least Shayne has not indicated that 
they were).  Kayne reminds me of my niece and nephew's names (Kade and Konner 
Carnahan).  

I just talked to Carlos.  He is already in Colorado and in the process of 
renting a car.  I told him about the gift thing and he does not think it 
would be a problem.  The deal is, that the Indian Chief that Matt Gimble has 
been dealing with was ousted and so Matt, et al. want to give the "new" Chief 
a saddle and maybe a fishing real.  They also want to give the 4 tribal 
counsel and their attorney pen & pencil sets and shirts.

Anyway, Carlos did not think it would be a problem but asked me to double 
check with Andy Edison just in case.

How embarrassing to be stripped of chiefhood!  I'll bet ole' Chief Sitting 
Bull is turning over in his grave!

I've got the crib, a playpen, red and blue check bumpers for the crib, a 
never used airplane baby swing you hang on a trees (our trees were too tall), 
perhaps a jogging stroller (don't think we gave it away), and I don't know 
what else.  All have "baby Carnahan" on it.  Will she give the baby her last 
name?  That would be cool.

I met someone (a guy)  named Kayne.  Yes, I know it looks like Kay, but I 
thought it sounded cool.  Kayne Carnahan.  Opps, sounds like a bull rider!

Kay:

George Kutzschbach of Fulbright called this afternoon to request copies of
the executed Assignment and Assumption Agreements and Bills of Sale for the
turbine/transformer transaction between ENA and Sweetgum Energy LP.  George
has unsigned copies of these documents.  Our closing volumes also contain
only unsigned copies of these documents.

George is asking for the documents with respect to both the turbines and
the
transformer, but is needing them specifically for the transformer.
Apparently, CA-II is planning to sell the transformer, and he is gathering
up the documents that would show title to the transformer in CA-II.

I have reviewed the documents, and do not see any reason why we should not
deliver them.  Can you provide signed copies of these documents?   Thanks.

Gentlemen,

Could we schedule some time for a conference call next week?  I would
appreciate the opportunity to work through some of the legal issues.  I
have the lofty goal of not working Memorial Day weekend this year, so I'm
trying to get as much done on this deal as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Kay

PS.  I'm open Tues am and most of Wednesday.  I can probably work my
schedule so that I'm available quite a bit of next week.

I do not necessarily anticipate a problem, but because I believe that Enron 
is considering the possibility of entering into another transaction with 
Ameresco, I have asked Lance Schuler to make sure that there is no conflict

Gentlemen,

I'm with EWS Legal, and I'm working with John Llodra (East Power origination) 
concerning a confidentiality agreement with Ameresco.  The proposed 
transaction is described as follows:

 A potential power plant site development and asset management services 
related to the Island End Generation Project, a nominal  365 MW combined 
cycle power generation facility, proposed to be located in Everett, 
Massachusetts.

The current draft of the CA contains this language:

 From the time of the signing of this Agreement until October 1, 2001 neither 
Party shall pursue the Proposed Transaction without  the participation of the 
other Party, unless the other Party consents in writing or notifies the other 
Party that it does not intend to   pursue the Proposed Transaction.

In accordance with policy, this issue is being submitted to you for your 
review.  

John can be contacted at 978 449 9936.  My extension is 57566.

Thank you,

Kay

Here is the entire CA:

Jim,

I would suggest that we arrange for another inspection of the generator at 
the Westinghouse facility here in Houston.  I would suggest that Westinghouse 
bring additional experts and would also suggest that the insurance company 
send an additional surveyor.  I firmly believe that Mr Newell does not 
appreciate complexity and of the generator and all the electrical properties 
of the insulation system and he is not going to change his mind.

I will defer to Ben for final direction.

Chris

Subject: SWPC 501D5A Generator Damager onboard M/V:  INDUSTRIAL BRIDGE

Have just talked with adjuster again, and she has preliminary verbal report 
from surveyor who says that drawings merely confirm his prior contention that 
this generator was NOT a total loss at the time of the loss, but that further 
inspection of the unit would be necessary to prove otherwise.  

The comments from Andrew Edison about pressing SWPC on their responsibilities 
and ownership of the unit, this has previously been expressed by the adjuster 
to Jim Bouillion.  She definitely would like to have a sit down meeting with 
Enron people only, not SWPC at this time,  to discuss options and where we go 
from here.  She still hasn't signed the CA, but that is not necessary as she 
is not looking at the drawings and looking at them by her is not necessary 
for the purpose of a meeting with Enron.  

I did not check her availability for a meeting at this time because my 
schedule for Mon-Tues is still up in the air, and Jim Bouillion has a Mon-Wed 
meeting with our captive insurer in Vermont and would not be available before 
Thursday.  Do we collectively want to go forward with the sit down meeting 
with the adjuster, and if yes, who all needs to be involved and what are 
their availabilities?

Concerning the VALUE of the generator, the declared value of the entire 
shipment was $24,506,000.  There is no breakdown on the paperwork I have (or 
the broker) that puts a separate value on just the generator.  Thus I guess 
someone either has that or SWPC can provide that information.  The policy is 
not a "replacement cost value"  policy nor an "actual cash value" policy, but 
a "valued" policy.  What that means is we get paid what ever we declared the 
value to be CIF + 10%.  Hence the need to know what part of the $24,506,000 
is the "value" of the generator.

I await further instructions as to how you want to proceed.

 Attached is a blackline of the City of Austin Turbine Agreement
showing changes made to the version that went to GE on February 12. This
draft includes both Lee's and Eric's changes to Exhibit A, as well as
the addition of the contacts for notices in Sections 25.1 and 25.3.  It
also contains a few minor clean-up items identified by Lisa Bills when
she reviewed LV Cogen (e.g., the definitions of Performance Test
Certificate and Performance Test Completion Certificate were out of
order).  To complete the agreement, we will need to include the date of
execution and Exhibit H-2.  I particularly wanted Eric to review this
before it went to the other side.  If it looks acceptable, I would be
happy to send a copy to GE.

Kay, note the discrepencies and we will deal with on a case-by-case basis.  I

Subject: Re: GE- Standard Domestic Contract- Need your help  

Would you all be in a posiotion to get together tomorrow morning at 9:30 am 
Houston time to review the issues list and  talk about how we get to the end 
of this process with GE.  We immediately need to start the drafting of the 
Longview turbine contract and I'd like to see if we are close enough to get 
that started.  Scott, today the extension to the Agreement in Principle 
expires and we need to extend.  Can you tee this up with Steve Swift?  Our 
meeting tomorrow will be in lieu of the regularly scheduled GE call.  I'll 
let them know we will call them later this week or we'll talk next Wednesday, 
but I would like to get through whatever we need to in order to get the 
Longview Turbine Contract going.  
I've talked to John Schwartzenburg about this and he is available tomorrow 
morning.

Kent,

Please review and note that this needs to be completed by week's end.
Closing date is 5/1 and I'm out rest of week 5/2-6.  We may need some of
Kay's help if we don't like what we see.  But let's try to work it out with
Dale Rasmussen first (Enron Portland office).

Hello Lee.  (I know your thinking - What now!)

As I'm sure you know, we are fast approaching a full notice to proceed on
the LVCII project.  One item that we have as part of our EPC contract with
Modern Continental South, is an Assignment and Assumption Agreement whereby
MCS will assume certain responsibilities for (owner), and abide by the
conditions set forth in that agreement.  We will ask GE to participate in
that Agreement.  I have attached that agreement to this e mail for your
review.  Current plans are for a full NTP (Notice To Proceed) to begin
construction on May 1, and we are working hard to be ready for that key
milestone to occur. Your review and concurrence on the draft document
attached below is appreciated.

Please review and contact me should you have any questions.

Sincerely

W. J.  (Bill) Williams Jr

Attached is FERC authorization for EPMI and EES to purchase power from 
industrials NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire).  The 
industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC 
(subject to EPMI and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for 
the industrials). 

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used 
primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be "public utilities" 
subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell 
power at wholesale from such facilities to EPMI and EES without prior notice 
under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice 
filing).  
  -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; 
however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing 
requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while 
they are selling at wholesale.
 -- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the 
industrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of 
the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from 
each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.  
Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these 
purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be 
separate from our big quarterly reports.
 -- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any 
rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industrial 
to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless 
otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff.

West Desk:  This is similar to the authorization that FERC gave last week to 
purchases from industrials in WSCC.


____________________________________
On April 27, FERC issued an order granting EPMI and EES the authority to 
purchase power from IPPs at market-based rates.  As the attached order 
indicates, the effective date of the EPMI and EES rate schedules is March 6, 
2001.

Please find attached a draft letter agreement from FPL.  I've taken the 
liberty of making changes that I beleive may meet with the accounting 
requirements de jour.  Basically we need to throw this letter away and start 
over.  The balance of funds left over from the feasibility studies and 
facility study for the Midway project is $122,000.  According to Dan Meyers 
of FPL, this is about 2 months worth of work.  

We can start negotiations on the interconnection agreement any time.  I'd 
suggest we start now unless our prospective partner would want to be involved.

We have several other Florida opportunities that are at about a 50% 
probability (Corbett, Deerfield, Pompano, and South Dade). We also have 
projects in Goergia (Hartwell and Athens) that are probably 70%, and 
Louisiana (Calcasieu and St Charles) that are 50%. I would put Midway at 90%. 
The non-Florida opportunities would be used to package with the turbines and 
flip a la Pastoria. We have strong interest in Georgia in particular, and 
have received a written offer from FPL to purchase the development assets of 
Hartwell and Athens for $4.4 million (no equip. included).

I would presume we would put the turbines back on the market in Q1 of '02 if 
we do not proceed with any Florida opportunities. I think the downside is 
approximately $2 million per unit (given that that is our effective premium 
being offered today), but that we have a natural hedge on this downside as we 
have a high chance of recouping any downside by combining the turbines with 
any of the development assets listed above (they have all been permitted for 
7FAs, although not all permits have been received).

Depending upon the route we take for approval (turbine purchase vs. project 
approval), the DASH process should take no more than 5 to 10 days.  How firm 
are we on the Midway project?

I think Ben's time frame is realistic. I assume we will enter into an 
assignment and assumption agreement with Sithe, to which GE will consent. In 
addition, we may need an override letter to the turbine contract to address 
the E-Next/accounting issues. GE is familiar with what we need in for E-Next, 
which should help expedite matters.

Subject: RE: GE Turbines

I've been told that we need to resubmit a non-binding expression of interest 
by Tuesday. Previously, we submitted a one page non-binding letter indicating 
that the FMV of the units is $44 MM each. You raise a good point in that we 
should be prepared to say (again, on a non-binding basis) how long we will 
need to close (in addition to increasing the bid on the units). I think if 
our number is good, 30 - 45 days for documentation and close would work, but 
I think we should also be willing to post some non-refundable $s within say, 
2 weeks on the basis of an exclusivity agreement with Sithe. 

The group's thoughts on this would be appreciated.

Thanks.

What is expected for the Tuesday bid? I would guess the most critical from a 
timing perspective will be a response centered on price and 
commercial/technical issues. Michael indicates below he would like a 
timetable for internal approvals to a closing. Do we have any indication how 
pressed he is to close and fund versus agreeing on economic terms quickly and 
allowing us to review the form of contract to ensure compliance with 
accounting and finance guidlelines along the lines of our discussion earlier 
this week? Thanks.

All:

FYI, tomorrow I should receive turbine contracts for the 3 GE 7FAs being sold 
by Site. Please see the e-mail below from Sithe's advisor regarding the 
transaction schedule. Kay and I plan to initially review the contract, and I 
have a technical team (Booth / Rose) ready to review the contracts as well.

>From an accounting / finance perspective, I am interested in how we should 
proceed given the circumstances. Kay and my initial plan is to review the 
contracts from a technical / legal / commercial perspective and submit a 
revised indicative number by Tuesday in consultation with Duran. Between now 
and then, it would be helpful to know from accounting / finance how we should 
proceed given that we are in a bidding situation (with I'm told three other 
bidders). Herman / Rose / Lisa - please let me know your thoughts on this.

Chip - I would like Chris Booth to work with you on putting a draft DASH 
together.

In the meantime, I will forward turbine contracts to everyone as soon as I 
receive them.

Regards,

Ben

Per our conversation today, the turbine contract and LTSA are being sent
via Fed Ex to your office in Houston.

Final bids are due next Tuesday, June 5th via fax to 781-270-0055.  Bids
should include best price and a closing schedule (date by which bidder will
have all internal approvals necessary to enter into a binding agreement
with Seller subject only to consent from GE).

Thanks again for you patience and please call me if you have any questions,

Audrey,

Ben and I have reached an agreement which will be documented as follows:

1)  Extension of Dates -- May  11 becomes May 9 (Wed)

2)  Ben will edit the latest version of the Amendment #2 so that

a) on Aug 1, we pay the greater of the $1.5MM ($2.5 less $1 paid at
exercise) and the Additional Compensation (less the $1 MM)

b)  a separate agreement whereby Corp guarantees the payment on Aug 1.

The intention is to sign the Amendment #3 before 5/9.

Thanks everyone for making this happen.

Steve Hase

Subject: Confidentiality agreement

Gentlemen,

I'm with EWS Legal, and I'm working with John Llodra (East Power origination) 
concerning a confidentiality agreement with Ameresco.  The proposed 
transaction is described as follows:

 A potential power plant site development and asset management services 
related to the Island End Generation Project, a nominal  365 MW combined 
cycle power generation facility, proposed to be located in Everett, 
Massachusetts.

The current draft of the CA contains this language:

 From the time of the signing of this Agreement until October 1, 2001 neither 
Party shall pursue the Proposed Transaction without  the participation of the 
other Party, unless the other Party consents in writing or notifies the other 
Party that it does not intend to   pursue the Proposed Transaction.

In accordance with policy, this issue is being submitted to you for your 
review.  

John can be contacted at 978 449 9936.  My extension is 57566.

Thank you,

Kay

Here is the entire CA:

I can't wait to use the "baby Carnahan" things!  It makes me excited just to 
think about it.  And funny you would mention the last name thing because I 
was just thinking about that last night.  The father's name is Dustin Elkins, 
but I doubt they will get married (at least Shayne has not indicated that 
they were).  Kayne reminds me of my niece and nephew's names (Kade and Konner 
Carnahan).  

I just talked to Carlos.  He is already in Colorado and in the process of 
renting a car.  I told him about the gift thing and he does not think it 
would be a problem.  The deal is, that the Indian Chief that Matt Gimble has 
been dealing with was ousted and so Matt, et al. want to give the "new" Chief 
a saddle and maybe a fishing real.  They also want to give the 4 tribal 
counsel and their attorney pen & pencil sets and shirts.

Anyway, Carlos did not think it would be a problem but asked me to double 
check with Andy Edison just in case.

How embarrassing to be stripped of chiefhood!  I'll bet ole' Chief Sitting 
Bull is turning over in his grave!

I've got the crib, a playpen, red and blue check bumpers for the crib, a 
never used airplane baby swing you hang on a trees (our trees were too tall), 
perhaps a jogging stroller (don't think we gave it away), and I don't know 
what else.  All have "baby Carnahan" on it.  Will she give the baby her last 
name?  That would be cool.

I met someone (a guy)  named Kayne.  Yes, I know it looks like Kay, but I 
thought it sounded cool.  Kayne Carnahan.  Opps, sounds like a bull rider!

We need to know how probable the other projects are; at what point do we 
propose to put the turbines back on the market for re-sale; and what is our 
best estimate of the potential downside upon re-sale.

I think we decided to take the turbine purchase approval route, and describe

you still OK with that?

Depending upon the route we take for approval (turbine purchase vs. project 
approval), the DASH process should take no more than 5 to 10 days.  How firm 
are we on the Midway project?

I think Ben's time frame is realistic. I assume we will enter into an 
assignment and assumption agreement with Sithe, to which GE will consent. In 
addition, we may need an override letter to the turbine contract to address 
the E-Next/accounting issues. GE is familiar with what we need in for E-Next, 
which should help expedite matters.

I've been told that we need to resubmit a non-binding expression of interest 
by Tuesday. Previously, we submitted a one page non-binding letter indicating 
that the FMV of the units is $44 MM each. You raise a good point in that we 
should be prepared to say (again, on a non-binding basis) how long we will 
need to close (in addition to increasing the bid on the units). I think if 
our number is good, 30 - 45 days for documentation and close would work, but 
I think we should also be willing to post some non-refundable $s within say, 
2 weeks on the basis of an exclusivity agreement with Sithe. 

The group's thoughts on this would be appreciated.

Thanks.

What is expected for the Tuesday bid? I would guess the most critical from a 
timing perspective will be a response centered on price and 
commercial/technical issues. Michael indicates below he would like a 
timetable for internal approvals to a closing. Do we have any indication how 
pressed he is to close and fund versus agreeing on economic terms quickly and 
allowing us to review the form of contract to ensure compliance with 
accounting and finance guidlelines along the lines of our discussion earlier 
this week? Thanks.

FYI, tomorrow I should receive turbine contracts for the 3 GE 7FAs being sold 
by Site. Please see the e-mail below from Sithe's advisor regarding the 
transaction schedule. Kay and I plan to initially review the contract, and I 
have a technical team (Booth / Rose) ready to review the contracts as well.

>From an accounting / finance perspective, I am interested in how we should

contracts from a technical / legal / commercial perspective and submit a

proceed given that we are in a bidding situation (with I'm told three other 
bidders). Herman / Rose / Lisa - please let me know your thoughts on this.

Chip - I would like Chris Booth to work with you on putting a draft DASH

In the meantime, I will forward turbine contracts to everyone as soon as I 
receive them.

Per our conversation today, the turbine contract and LTSA are being sent
via Fed Ex to your office in Houston.

Final bids are due next Tuesday, June 5th via fax to 781-270-0055.  Bids
should include best price and a closing schedule (date by which bidder will
have all internal approvals necessary to enter into a binding agreement
with Seller subject only to consent from GE).

So if we buy the property before the LLC is owned by ENext the entire project 
goes on the balance sheet since we will be committed to building a road and 
stormwater system.  There we all must be aware that we can not close on the 
property until the LLC is owned by ENext.  Do you agree?

Put the land on the balance sheet is a forgiveable sin.  Incurring any other

If we buy the property before the LLC is owned by ENext, wouldn't the big

than the rather small ongoing costs related to maintainance of the road and

Subject: Open items for MDEA

[Fairley, David]  


Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of 
the agreement:


1. How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily 
average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?
[Fairley, David]  
Each utility is obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the 
appropriate Exhibit and the Stack Model.  As conditions change the utilities 
must update this info.  We are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel 
usage.  Services and Orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a 
quarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used 
are satisfactiry -- it can never be exact, but it should be accurate within a 
band of acceptability.  No GADS.  Heat rates will be adjusted in the model as 
often as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient 
temps..

2. Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?
[Fairley, David]  
Yes, their units are too small.  We have discussed this with the customer, 
and with our internal air permit guys.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  They have Title V permits, and they are faxing them to 
us today.  They have no run hour limitations on gas, however, they are 
limited on oil.  Will need to get that summary to Kay as soon as possible.


3. We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?
[Fairley, David]  
We won't buy and sell fuel oil.  We may dispatch on oil at start-up, or we 
may switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable, which constitutes a Product 
transaction with the resulting profit split.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  We need to state that MDEA and Cities are responsible 
for maintaining fuel oil supplies.

4. We aren't making money on gas, right?
[Fairley, David]  
We make money on gas two ways.  The first is outside the contract, and is 
basicly any internal profit on re-sale of gas to the Cities.  The second way 
we can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a Product 
trade, and those procedures apply.

5. Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in 
to the picture?
[Fairley, David]  
Yes, will send separately.

6. Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  
[Fairley, David]  
The Marketing Strategy, the Trading and Risk Policy, and the Description of 
Asset Management have been upated.  The other Exhibits have not been 
modified.  The Marketing Strategy and Trading & Risk Policy have been 
discussed at length with MDEA (MDEA commercial, not legal), and their 
comments/questions incorporated.
  
 

7. It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the 
following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) 
formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to 
work on.  
[Fairley, David]  
Thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the 
parties.  Will look at it again.  Conceptually, MDEA, Services Group, and 
Orig are in full agreement, so we need to make sure that the contract 
language is clear enough.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example.

 Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of 
power)? 
[Fairley, David]  
There are three considerations on this: (1) who wears imbalance exposure?, 
(2) who manages imbalances (hourly type activity), and (3) who pays for 
imbalances?  Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their 
Network Services Agreement.  EPMI's hourly desk manages the load/resource 
items hourly, but MDEA has the exposure (physical and price) to imbalances.  
Weather/load changes, and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances 
(they happen, they are uncontrollable, and we fix them) which EPMI's hourly 
desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions 
and obligations of the parties.  A different section in the contract states 
that MDEA wears the exposure.

 How are we setting the bogey?    Formula?   [Fairley, David]  The bogey is 
set when the load projection and stack models are run each day.  Both parties 
participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and 
planning the day's activities.  
[Rorschach, Reagan]  Records of bogey decisions will be archieved

Subject to audit?  [Fairley, David]    Yes, but they would be auditing 
something that is jointly derived each day.  Frankly, they would like to have 
less involvement; ie, they trust us to do it all, but we are requiring them 
to participate and buy in every day.  

Two bogeys or one (gas and oil)?
[Fairley, David]  
One bogey for power.  Gas is an input for determining the bogey.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  Bogey set day-ahead.

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or 
two would be helpful as a reality check.  
[Fairley, David]  
This is in the pricing calc's.  Should we have a definition?

What costs are included on the buy and sell side [Fairley, David]  see cost 
definition being provided separately.
 



Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used. 
[Fairley, David]    See definition in my mark-up's to the main agreement. 

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits. 
[Fairley, David]   Services and Orig are reviewing these, but other than what 
was mentioned above, probably no changes unless you see a specific area that 
is a problem. 

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split 
costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?
[Rorschach, Reagan]  I will be getting exhibits of the reporting both daily 
and monthly.  We need to make sure to limit our info providing 
responsibilities to those reports.

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these 
questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

Thanks,

Kay

Legal folks -- please let me know of any other legal people who should be 
added to interconnection issue emails.


On May 16, FERC clarified its policy regarding credits for network upgrades 
associated with the interconnection of a generating facility -- all network 
upgrade costs (the cost of all facilities from the point where the generator 
connects to the grid), including those necessary to remedy short-circuit and 
stability problems, should be credited back to the customer that funded the 
upgrades once the delivery service begins.

Once a customer signs up for transmission, then the transmission provider is 
limited to charging the higher of the expansion cost or an embedded cost rate.

Generally, Enron has not procured transmission at the time of interconnection 
and therefore, may be required to pay the network upgrades at the time of 
interconnection; however, the order clarifies that a credit should be 
available to the interconnecting customer or a third party that contracts for 
transmission away from the generator.

I think Ben's time frame is realistic. I assume we will enter into an 
assignment and assumption agreement with Sithe, to which GE will consent. In 
addition, we may need an override letter to the turbine contract to address 
the E-Next/accounting issues. GE is familiar with what we need in for E-Next, 
which should help expedite matters.

I've been told that we need to resubmit a non-binding expression of interest 
by Tuesday. Previously, we submitted a one page non-binding letter indicating 
that the FMV of the units is $44 MM each. You raise a good point in that we 
should be prepared to say (again, on a non-binding basis) how long we will 
need to close (in addition to increasing the bid on the units). I think if 
our number is good, 30 - 45 days for documentation and close would work, but 
I think we should also be willing to post some non-refundable $s within say, 
2 weeks on the basis of an exclusivity agreement with Sithe. 

The group's thoughts on this would be appreciated.

Thanks.

What is expected for the Tuesday bid? I would guess the most critical from a 
timing perspective will be a response centered on price and 
commercial/technical issues. Michael indicates below he would like a 
timetable for internal approvals to a closing. Do we have any indication how 
pressed he is to close and fund versus agreeing on economic terms quickly and 
allowing us to review the form of contract to ensure compliance with 
accounting and finance guidlelines along the lines of our discussion earlier 
this week? Thanks.

FYI, tomorrow I should receive turbine contracts for the 3 GE 7FAs being sold 
by Site. Please see the e-mail below from Sithe's advisor regarding the 
transaction schedule. Kay and I plan to initially review the contract, and I 
have a technical team (Booth / Rose) ready to review the contracts as well.

>From an accounting / finance perspective, I am interested in how we should 
proceed given the circumstances. Kay and my initial plan is to review the 
contracts from a technical / legal / commercial perspective and submit a 
revised indicative number by Tuesday in consultation with Duran. Between now 
and then, it would be helpful to know from accounting / finance how we should 
proceed given that we are in a bidding situation (with I'm told three other 
bidders). Herman / Rose / Lisa - please let me know your thoughts on this.

Chip - I would like Chris Booth to work with you on putting a draft DASH 
together.

In the meantime, I will forward turbine contracts to everyone as soon as I 
receive them.

Ben:

Per our conversation today, the turbine contract and LTSA are being sent
via Fed Ex to your office in Houston.

Final bids are due next Tuesday, June 5th via fax to 781-270-0055.  Bids
should include best price and a closing schedule (date by which bidder will
have all internal approvals necessary to enter into a binding agreement
with Seller subject only to consent from GE).

Thanks again for you patience and please call me if you have any questions,

Just ran into Nick Cocovasis in the elevator.  Today is his last day at 
Enron, he accepted a position with AEP just yesterday (or very recently).  Of 
course I had to ask if Ann Elizabeth was also going.  He said, "She will 
probably go too", although I do not know what he was basing that comment on.  
We will see.

Kay

When are you available today to get together and call Ben about the Blue Dog 
invoices?  As far as I know, Ben's only conflict today is a meeting from 2-3 
(Houston time), and I can come up to your office any time.

Also, an attorney from King & Spalding (I believe she said her name was 
Marisa Rudder?) left a message for me last night asking about the status of 
the original closing documents for the Blue Dog/Northwestern transaction.  Do 
you know where these are?

Thanks,
Rebecca

Before we send anything other than the "thank you" e-mail I sent to Jeff, and 
before we have any conversations with GE on this point, we need to seek Kay's 
guidance based on her read of the contract and the issues Jeff raised in his 
letter.

Kay - will you have some time to talk about this Friday?

Ben

The way we actually paid the invoices changed slightly after Chris had sent 
the letter to GE.  We deducted the LD's and the retention amount from the 
April 25th invoice (since the May invoice was not due until May 25th).

On May 8th, a wire totalling $1,671,039 was sent to GE -- this represented 
$469,000 for the c/o #2 invoice and $1,202,039 for the April 25th invoice 
less the LD's and retention.

To respond to Jeff Darst's letter, we can say that we are planning on paying 
the May 25th invoice in full (assuming we're not planning on deducting 
additional LD's for May 8-May 25).  

We just need to clarify with Jeff that both the LD and the retention were 
deducted from the April invoice, and then we can deal with resolving the 
issues he discusses in his letter.

Regards,
Rebecca

I think we decided to take the turbine purchase approval route, and describe 
the several projects (Midway et al) that we can match the turbines with. Are 
you still OK with that?

Depending upon the route we take for approval (turbine purchase vs. project

are we on the Midway project?

I think Ben's time frame is realistic. I assume we will enter into an 
assignment and assumption agreement with Sithe, to which GE will consent. In 
addition, we may need an override letter to the turbine contract to address 
the E-Next/accounting issues. GE is familiar with what we need in for E-Next, 
which should help expedite matters.

I've been told that we need to resubmit a non-binding expression of interest 
by Tuesday. Previously, we submitted a one page non-binding letter indicating 
that the FMV of the units is $44 MM each. You raise a good point in that we 
should be prepared to say (again, on a non-binding basis) how long we will 
need to close (in addition to increasing the bid on the units). I think if 
our number is good, 30 - 45 days for documentation and close would work, but 
I think we should also be willing to post some non-refundable $s within say, 
2 weeks on the basis of an exclusivity agreement with Sithe. 

The group's thoughts on this would be appreciated.

Thanks.

What is expected for the Tuesday bid? I would guess the most critical from a 
timing perspective will be a response centered on price and 
commercial/technical issues. Michael indicates below he would like a 
timetable for internal approvals to a closing. Do we have any indication how 
pressed he is to close and fund versus agreeing on economic terms quickly and 
allowing us to review the form of contract to ensure compliance with 
accounting and finance guidlelines along the lines of our discussion earlier 
this week? Thanks.

FYI, tomorrow I should receive turbine contracts for the 3 GE 7FAs being sold 
by Site. Please see the e-mail below from Sithe's advisor regarding the 
transaction schedule. Kay and I plan to initially review the contract, and I 
have a technical team (Booth / Rose) ready to review the contracts as well.

>From an accounting / finance perspective, I am interested in how we should

contracts from a technical / legal / commercial perspective and submit a

proceed given that we are in a bidding situation (with I'm told three other 
bidders). Herman / Rose / Lisa - please let me know your thoughts on this.

Chip - I would like Chris Booth to work with you on putting a draft DASH 
together.

In the meantime, I will forward turbine contracts to everyone as soon as I 
receive them.

Final bids are due next Tuesday, June 5th via fax to 781-270-0055.  Bids
should include best price and a closing schedule (date by which bidder will
have all internal approvals necessary to enter into a binding agreement
with Seller subject only to consent from GE).

Kay-I spoke to George, and although he will check with InterGen, he believes
that InterGen will be amenable to allowing Enron to exercise its put.  I
don't think they'd go to GE for an acknowledgment from GE that the exercise
was okay, but frankly, based on what GE has already agreed to, I don't think
anyone needs it.

Kay,

A few weeks ago I spoke with John Keffer regarding Sweetgum Energy LLC's
request that Ben Jacoby sign unanimous resolutions of CAED I & II approving
the sale by CAED I and II of their respective GE turbines to Sweetgum.  As
of today, Sweetgum has not received back the resolutions signed by Ben. As I
explained to John, Sweetgum and InterGen would appreciate Ben's prompt
execution and return of the resolutions.  If Enron does not wish for Ben to
sign the resolutions, then Sweetgum and InterGen would appreciate your
advising us of that as soon as possible.

As I explained to John, Sweetgum would like to have unanimous resolutions as
this is more customary and cleaner, however, since Ben received the required
3 business days prior notice of the proposed resolutions, the resolutions
only need the majority approval of the board members.

I would appreciate hearing back from you at your earliest convenience.

George

Subject: Yazoo City

Hi there,

We need the exact name of the YC entity which will be buying the gas.  Is it 
Yazoo City or the YCPC, or what?  Same info is required for Clarksdale, 
although not as urgently.

If you will email me the addresses of all who need to review this, the YC 
contract will be ready tomorrow.

Thanks,

Kay

If you prorate the min. monthly fee for a partial month, and you prorate the 
termination for the balance of that partial month, you--in aggregate--get the 
beginning balance shown on the schedule.

The value in the table is the beginning balance for each month.  So if they 
cancel in the middle of the month, they should pay the balance at the 
beginning of that month and no prorated minimum monthly fee.  If you prorate 
it on both ends, you end up getting the total balance shown at the beginning 
of the month.

Kay, see attached.  The monthly fee should be $13,003.  I took the $300k we 
have all been discussing and backed out the $12,500 they paid under the ILA 
terms.

More:

We need internal agreement on the cancellation fee schedule, to be included 
as an exhibit.

What is the status of the Yazoo City master gas agreement?  Do we still want 
a master gas agreement for Clarksdale, also?  Do we want it now?

Thanks,

Kay

Subject: Open items for MDEA

Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of 
the agreement:


How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily 
average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?

Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?

We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?

We aren't making money on gas, right?

Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to 
the picture?

Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  

It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the 
following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) 
formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to 
work on.   Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost 
of power)?  How are we setting the bogey?  Formula?  Subject to audit? Two 
bogeys or one (gas and oil)?

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or 
two would be helpful as a reality check.  What costs are included on the buy 
and sell side?

Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split 
costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these 
questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

Thanks,

Kay

Your right.  We're very close there.  Lee just sent a message to you and when 
done with his adds - we'll be ready to finalize on the GE contract.
The ABB is a bit of a FUBAR because of versions that are not current.  Peter 
is tackling this and working with Don Hammond.  Should be ready soon.

Kay,

Here is the Cover Sheet and Attachments for the above C/P.  I wasn't sure 
about the due diligence on the "agency relationship" so was unsure as to 
whether to put those riders in.  I have attached those riders so you can 
advise me.  The Agreement is housed in your directory minus the General Terms 
and Conditions.  When you are ready to send the Agreement then I can attach 
the GTC.

Thanks,

Hi John,

Enron is ok with signing the consents.  After the assignment of the
contracts out of LLCs, we would like to exercise our put.  Please share

I believe Ben will be in town tomorrow (right Ben?) so we can get it signed

Yes, we have a TECO CA.

The counterparty to the Participation Agreement is with Fort Pierce Utilities 
Authority.  The reason you thought we were just sending out the public 
documents is because that is want Ben wants you to think.  He had Fred Mitro 
send out alot of the "unexecuted proposed agreements" to TECO prior to our 
meeting the other day (which is why Bart and I have been concerned).

I don't believe we need Keffer's input to process the LOI.  I can have their 
power guy look at the term sheet if we think we are done with it.

I will review your comments on the LOI.  I wanted to check with make sure 
that someone at King & Spalding is reviewing the Midway term sheet along with 
the LOI, so that we can send the term sheet to TECO on Monday/Tuesday.

Let me know.

Ben,

I made a minor adjustment to the LOI re: exclusivity.    

 << File: Midway TECO LOI june 1.doc >> 

Policy states that any time we sign up to exclusivity we are supposed to get 
it approved by Mark Metts, Tim Detmering and the CEO of the affected business 
unit.  Seems a little silly in this case, but it can't hurt. (yes, I know we 
didn't do it with the turbine stuff)

Kay

Our department will be migrated to Outlook in two groups.  The first group 
will be migrated on Monday, June 11,  and the second group will be migrated 
on Tuesday, June 12.   You will receive four e-mails from the Outlook 
migration team.  Please do not delete them.  You will need to open the four 
e-mails and follow the instructions to migrate to Outlook.

Assistants, you will be responsible for scheduling training for yourself and 
your assignments.  It is recommended everyone attend a one hour training 
class.  Training can be scheduled by contacting Maggie Cruz at extension 
3-1816.  (Assistants, please coordinate training with your backup so both of 
you are not in training at the same time.)  Outlook migration specialists 
will be on the 38th floor to answer questions Tuesday and Wednesday, June 12 
and 13.

Listed below is useful information provided to us by the Outlook Migration 
team.  

E-mail Policies

Users will be restricted to a Mailbox size of 100 MB.  

Further mailbox size restrictions are detailed as follows:

Issue Warning at 75 MB - users are automatically sent a warning from the 
System Administrator explaining they are near their Mailbox limit.

Prohibit Send at 100 MB - users are prevented from sending e-mail, yet they 
can still receive internal and external messages.  Users must reduce the size 
of their mailbox by deleting old mail, saving attachments to a local drive, 
etc. before they can send e-mail again.   

Inbound/Outbound Mail Size Limits - inbound and outbound e-mail messages will 
be limited to a size of 10MB.

Deleted Item Retention - users will be able to recover deleted items from 
their mailbox as old as 8 days.  Deleted items include e-mail messages, 
folders, contacts, calendar entries, tasks, notes, journal entries and 
meeting notices.

Archiving - archiving will not be a supported feature of Outlook 2000. 

Migration Preparation

Clean Your Mailbox - due to new space limitations on your mailbox, you are 
advised to clean your Notes mailbox of old, unneeded messages BEFORE 
migration.  If you are at the 100MB limit on the day of migration, you will 
not be able to send messages once you are in Outlook.

Limits on Items Migrated  - from the day of your migration, only 30 days of 
old mail will be migrated from your mailbox.  This includes mail in your 
inbox and other folders.  Calendar items dating back one year from the day of 
migration will be migrated (with the exception of repeating appointments).

Hi Kay Kay. Just wanted to say hello and wishing you a great week. Thanks
for letting Michael come see us. We really enjoyed his visit. We enjoyed
Neil being here. Just sorry he had to meet up with a hardhead. I bet he has
a sore foot? Norm is catching crabs for us today. I forgot to tell Neil
about the crabs.We love you. Mother

Debbie Skinner is sending you a new password.  You will use this for HRonline 
and also IBuyIt.  Let me know if you don't get it or it doesn't work.

Ok, you are going to have to go to HROnline and change the password to the 
one she is sending.  Wait about 10 minutes or so and then go into payables 
and try the new password.  I have Debbie's number if there are any problems.

OK. I'll forward you the agreement with her comments. My only concern is that 
I want to make sure we don't miss any points that could affect the 
financeability / market value. We previously had some folks at A&K look at 
IA's when we were doing the peakers. It might be worth asking Stuart if any 
major points came up as a result of this...

Ben,

If Christi has reviewed an interconnect agreement, I ususally don't have 
outside counsel review it unless there is a specific reason. She's the queen 
of interconnects.

I suppose that after I review it, next stop is Finance/Accounting.

Carlos has given me a couple of comments.

Carlos & Matt -

Thanks for the input.  These are good points, and they have me cautiously 
optimistic.

Let's have an S.I.T.  legal kick-off discussion early next week (Tuesday).  I 
would also like to include Marchris in the discussion.  I'll have my 
assistant set up the meeting and include a call-in number for Marchris.

Subject: Re: Seminole Indian Tribe Project  

Mathew,

Per our conversation yesterday, I would reiterate the importance of a team 
meeting on our potential project with the Seminoles given that there will be 
a lot of complex legal structuring required for the project in addition to 
all of the commercial structuring that you are still evaluating.  

As a general rule, you should know that under federal law, Indian tribes are 
legally treated as sovereign nations and so they are immune from regulation 
by a state government and immune from federal and state court jurisdiction 
unless they consent to it.  They are entitled to establish their own 
governing laws and regulations and are subject to very unique federal law 
requirements.  To illustrate, with respect to our potential project with them 
it means we will need to address such issues as: (1) getting BIA approval for 
our site acquisition on Indian land, non-Indians can only lease tribal land 
and for our type of transaction, our lease will require approval from the 
BIA; (2) tribal taxes may impact the facility; (3) tribal permits, licenses 
etc will apply, including tribal environmental laws -- the tribe may have its 
own tribal EPA for instance; (4) preserving the right to challenge any tribal 
taxes or regulations in courts, other than the tribal courts; (5) 
specifically getting waivers of sovereign immunity from the Tribe so that we 
can subject them to federal court jurisdiction; (6) specifically ensuring 
that the Tribe has complied with its own constitution and tribal rules in 
executing agreements so that such agreements are enforceable; and (7) 
specifically getting a waiver from the Tribe acknowledging and agreeing that 
Enron is not subject to the jurisdiction of the tribal courts.  Evaluating 
all of the above as well as the numerous other issues that will likely arise 
will require consultation with and the cooperation of the Tribe. 

As you know, I am still in the process of identifying outside counsel who is 
an expert in Indian law matters.  As an update on that, our other Florida law 
firm currently represents the Seminoles on other matters so they are 
conflicted out of representing us.  Presently, I am waiting to hear back from 
an Indian lawyer who was involved in the recent hotel/gaming development 
transaction between the Seminoles and the Hard Rock Cafe group.  Although he 
is based in Wisconsin, he is with a very large firm which has offices in 
Florida and Washington, DC, and which currently represents Enron on other 
matters.  After speaking with him, I will further debrief you and if we elect 
to engage him, I will then seek my internal approvals for doing so.  

In the interim, I have been receiving advice from a retired Vinson & Elkins 
lawyer who has worked with Enron on its other dealings when Indian tribes 
were involved (ie, right of way agreements involving our pipeline 
companies).  He has prepared a brief memo on his views on our letter of 
intent and general issues that arise when dealing with tribes.  I would be 
happy to share that document with you (note that I have tried to summarize 
most of it above.)  As a result of that memo, I do have some changes to 
incorporate into our letter of intent and I am still waiting to hear from you 
on how to modify the letter of intent based on your prior email.  (I also 
have a more comprehensive legal paper entitled "Energy Business in Indian 
Country: Opportunities and Obstacles" if you are having trouble sleeping at 
night.)  

Lastly, as for Bill Bryant's current activity below, based on what you've 
told me and the email traffic, he seems as if he is looking at the right 
regulatory issues, but with an area of law as so complex as this is, I would 
caution that you and Marchris should narrowly define and monitor his 
activities as it could otherwise quickly result in a very expensive research 
project.  

Thanks and please let me know when we discuss this project further.  At a 
minimum, I would suggest that we try to focus on finalizing the letter of 
intent with the Seminoles so that we can begin the process of exchanging 
confidential information and entering into more substantive discussions with 
them.

Mathew,

The law looks strong for our position although there is some contrary 
authority. I believe that the contrary Attorney General's opinion (not 
involving electric generation) can be distinguished. We are checking with the 
BIA in Washington and the Governor's office to see if there are any recent 
congressional acts or compacts with the tribe that would govern. (We are 
using as the basis for our inquiry a computer facility hypothetical that does 
not involve electric generation.)

We are also checking for Comprehensive Planning documents that may control 
land use on the reservation. It shouldn't be a problem unless the Plan is 
considered to be an environmental regulation.

We will keep you posted.

Bill,

As I mentioned on my phone message, if you are already in the process of
investigating how the Florida Siting Act applies to the Seminole Indian
Tribe of Florida ("SIT"), you may disregard this message.  If not, allow me
to explain.

We have been discussing potential generation opportunities on land owned by
SIT.  One project consists of coal-fired generation which would be located
on SIT's Brighton Reservation and the second project consists of a natural
gas-fired plant located on a site in Hollywood, FL.  Under either scenario,
we are curious as to how the Florida Power Plant Siting Act would apply.
SIT is of the opinion that the Siting Act may not apply to them.

Before we make any assumptions regarding this matter, could you review the
matter and let us know your opinion.  We are considering scheduling a
meeting with SIT at the end of next Friday, May 24.

Do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3526 cell (713) 594-0439 with any
comments or questions.

Thanks,
Mathew M Gimble

I was out of the office yesterday and apologize for the delay in
responding.
I'm not sure about class/type. Michael does see Sharon Seals and Associates
Speech-Language Pathologists once a week for 1 hour. The only testing has
been from Danny Williamson, Developmental Pediatrician who is an associate
of Nancy LaFever. This was an eval for ADHD. He was also tested by SBISD
for
the same issue. Williamson and LaFever have all this information in his
file.
Thanks for you help with this. Neil

Hi Neil!  Michael looked so happy to see you for chapel today.  Thanks for
being there.

I have a few questions in order to complete this form.  It asks a couple of
questions about the help he is receiving outside of school.  If you could
answer them for me, I can have this turned in tomorrow.

Classification?
Type?
Hours per Week?
Has Michael received any testing from the outside help (speech/language
specialist)?

Today Michael told me that I would "have to come over soon, because (he)
would be going far away from St. Francis for summer camp".  If he is
adamant
about us getting together outside of school, I would be happy to meet you
and Michael or Michael and Kay (or his sister) for a lunch date
somewhere/sometime this summer.  Let me know.

Once again, I have really enjoyed getting to know your family.  See you at
the party Wednesday at 2:15.

Lisa:

I have been the lead originator for LVC since we purchased the asset in 
August of 1999.  Given all that we are trying to accomplish to achieve a 
successful exit strategy with this asset, I have relied  on people like Bill 
Williams and his technical team to move this document and other similar 
efforts forward.  Having Bill's support on this document has allowed me to 
focus my efforts on closing the negotiations on our tolling agreement 
required to support the LVCII expansion.  

After my review of this agreement, along with in put from Bill Williams and 
Dale Rasmussen,  I will confirm back to you that your comments are 
appropriately reflected in the turbine contract to obtain signed off from ENA 
Finance.

I'm currently in Denver, please contact me on my cell phone should you have 
any questions.

Thank you,
Jim

Subject: LV Cogen Turbine Contract

Rose and I have reviewed the contract Peter sent to us yesterday - the draft 
distributed on April 24.  Rose has already provided our comments to Peter on 
the Override Letter which accompanies the contract.  I have one big issue 
which the lawyers can't answer as it is a business decision.  No one seems 
sure if Bill is the acting originator for this contract or not.  I leave it 
up to the LV Cogen Origination team to decide.  However, until I receive word 
back from the appropriate person and see my changes reflected in the turbine 
contract, Finance has not signed off on this agreement so it cannot be 
executed on E-Next's behalf.

What is the per UNIT turbine purchase amount?  The Purchase Amount is a 
remaining total balance outstanding.  In 6.1.2 Payment Schedule, the payment 
amount is a lump sum.  However, in the 2nd para. of 5.4 Cancellation and in 
6.1.3 Retention Letter(s) of Credit for example, each UNIT is discussed.  
There needs to be an allocation of the Purchase Amount and Payment Amount on 
a per turbine basis so Finance can track these costs as such in case a change 
order is made to only one turbine or if a turbine is removed from E-Next 
prior to all turbines being removed.  Also, how does anyone know for 6.1.3 
when the last $788,500 per Turbine is supposed to be paid so we can retain 
it?  

Also, I would appreciate receiving a clarification of why we don't define the 
Purchase Amount as the total and not just the balance remaining.  It could 
create discrepancies in the document and for anybody reading the document 
trying to understand how much each turbine costs.  E-Next has already made 
the approx $10mm payments made to-date.  However, if someone were to pick up 
the document to find out how much they could buy the turbines for, it would 
appear to be $53.6mm not the Maximum Liability Amount of $63.1mm.  2nd para 
of 5.4 refers to the portion of the Purchase Amount to be adjusted upon 
cancellation.  However, Exhibit I Cancellation refers to the Unit Liability 
Amount as the basis for calculation - this seems inconsistent to me.

 
Now for the general comments:

Section 1.69 and 1.70 need to change places to be alphabetically correct.

6.1.2 calls for a payment to be made on April 21, 2001.  Exhibit I 
Cancellation also has a line for cancellation between March 21 and April 20, 
2001.  This will need to be amended as this payment wasn't made given no 
contract execution yet.  As everyone knows also, E-Next must be the party to 
make this payment to insure the correct accounting treatment.

6.5 is another place where a per Unit price is discussed for increases or 
decreases.  How is this possible with an aggregate Purchase Amount?

In all Notice sections please delete "c/o Las Vegas Cogeneration II, L.L.C."  
This project is not associated with the E-Next financing.

10.2.3.1 Please underline "Optional Delivery Point"

10.12.2  Please delete the " ' " in "it's" after the proviso.

10.15  The timing of 120 days for delivery of serial numbers herein is 
inconsistent with the bracketed 5 months in 10.2.1 and Exhibit P.  Please 
conform all to the same time frame.

Has David Marshall reviewed all the insurance provisions of this document.  
While a standard turbine contract, there have been some recent 
modifications/views from our insurance providers.

I look forward to hearing back from the deal team and reviewing the next 
round of documents.

Okay.  I will set up a new LLC (Homestead Development Company, LLC, if 
available).  Would it be preferable for its sole member to be Lauderdale Land 
Development Company, LLC or ENA?

I wouldn't use  an LLC with an prior history.  We might have to get the old 
stuff approved in order to put the equity into TurboPark.  If the LLC paid 
for an interconnect study, it could be a hard cost and we are dead.

I know this seems silly, but hey, it is!

We have decided to use:  Voyager Development Company, L.L.C. for the new 
Homestead land option.  We had initially planned to use it for an option that 
we let go (Option Agreement never got assigned to Voyager either).  According 
to Greg Krause, the only thing associated with Voyager was an old 
interconnect study request that was paid for and never used.  I feel 
confident that Voyager is "clean" to use.

I talked to Kay about the new land option Greg will be negotiating this 
weekend in Homestead.  She said to put the options in the terminal company, 
not Lauderdale Land, LLC as you had suggested.  Pick one of the other LLCs 
for me and let me know the name.

Thanks.

Per the conference call of Wednesday, I revised Section 9.6 (with Scott

section.

I think this can be included in the version that goes to GE.  I
discussed
the concept with Jim Sutherland- he agreed with relaxing the unilateral
requirement in the case of GE.  We would not want to do this in the case
of
other vendors.

Subject: Consulting Agreements with lobbyists

As you know, in the last few months we have had discussions regarding the 
retention of lobbyists to perform services on our Florida Power Development 
Projects.  It was decided that we would have the lobbyists retained through 
the Government Affairs group.  Two recent agreements, one with Quantum 
Results and another with Tripp, Scott, provided for payments to be made at 
certain junctures of our development process.  It has come to our attention 
that these payments were not timely made.   In order to make sure that we 
don't inadvertently miss any future payments, I am proposing that:

1.  We continue to retain the consultants through execution of a consulting 
services agreement signed by Government Affairs.  The consulting agreements 
will be prepared in duplicate originals so that the lobbyist keeps one copy 
and Enron keeps one copy.

2.  Legal will retain Enron's executed original and provide it to Kay Young, 
who maintains a database of all consulting agreements and confidentiality 
agreements entered into by ENA entities.

3.  Legal will distribute a copy of the executed document to government 
affairs for their records.

4.  Legal will distribute a copy of the executed document to Kathleen 
Carnahan who will set up a payment schedule.  Unlike our real property option 
agreements that have a date certain for payment, these agreements often have 
payment schedules dependent upon some approval process.  Thus, it will be 
important for all of us to keep Kathleen in the loop as to dates of hearings 
or approvals so that she will know if it is time for a payment.

5.  Kathleen will provide notices to government affairs that a payment is 
due, and the amount of the payment and arrange for reimbursement of such 
payment out of the development group's RC.

6.  Government affairs will make the payments and be reimbursed out of the 
development group's RC.  

Please advise if this system will work for you so that we can undertake to 
have Kathleen begin setting up a payment schedule.

My strong preference is that we continue to keep things flowing through the 
government affairs group so that we consistently maintain the lobbyist 
relationship.  However, this will require government affairs have some way of 
monitoring the agreements.  I think we fix that problem with having Kathleen 
keep a consultant schedule just as she keeps an option schedule.

I'm going on vacation as of next Wednesday so your response by Tuesday will 
be greatly appreciated.

Greg and Isabel:

I still need signed copies of the following closing documents for our
closing volumes:

1.  Legal Opinion of counsel to GE;
2.  GE Parent Guaranty;
3.  Promissory Note of the LLC payable to PPL;
4.  Security Agreement by the LLC in favor of PPL;
5.  Financing Statements by the LLC;
6.  Letter of Credit furnished by GE;
7.  GE Acknowledgement of Receipt; and
8.  Consent of Directors of the LLC electing officers (signed by Kenneth
Ross).

Also, we have signed copies, but would like original signatures of the
parties other than ENA if available, of the following documents:

1.  Letter Agreement;
2.  Escrow Agreement;
3.  GE Letter re Forms of Agreement;
4.  ENA Letter re Forms of Agreement;
5.  Entitlement Letter Agreement;
6.  ENA Consent and Agreement;
7.  GE Consent and Agreement; and
8.  Escrow Disbursement Instructions.

As to the second list, there is no need for re-execution of any documents,
but I recall that you were having a sufficient number of originals signed by
your clients to provide an original signature to ENA.  Please advise of the
timing for forwarding these documents.  Thank you.

Subject: Westinghouse "Wet" Turbine

I have involved Andy Edison, one of ENA's litigation managers, in reviewing 
our potential claims against Westinghouse with respect to the "wet" turbine 
and the general issue of whether we have any type of "duty to mitigate" the 
expense of the cost of the replacement generator (ie, whether we have a duty 
to purchase the replacement generator at $3 mm since its cost might go up.)  
Andy has some interesting thoughts and questions, including why we aren't 
pressing Westinghouse harder with our claim and aren't pressing them harder 
to hold their price on the replacement generator for a longer time period 
given their potential exposure to us (arguably we might have a duty to 
mitigate the expense associated with the replacement generator if we have a 
reasonable basis for believing that the cost might go up).  Since there are 
no black and white answers, it probably would be useful to have a meeting to 
discuss our thoughts and address questions that we and you all may have.  
Please let me know your availability to meet either this week or early next.  
Lastly, Andy has noted that under our insurance policy we need to bring a 
lawsuit against the insurance carrier if they to fail resolve our claim 
before July 2001.  The practical impact of this is that we need to prepare a 
letter agreement whereby we and the insurance company agree to extend that 
time period.  Andy has recently prepared such a letter with respect to 
another claim and has agreed to prepare one for this claim as well.  Thanks.

I got your email about the 1 month contract, and I hope you got a memo last 
Friday from John Brunini giving you our research to date. I may be in Houston 
next week (probably the 8th or 9th) and possibly again early the following

Never stayed there.  My current favorite is the Omni, which is in one of may 
favorite locations. It has a little deli like shop across the street, where I 
can buy reasonably priced bagels, cokes, etc.  Last year I also stayed at the 
Marriott Marquis (BIG, right on Times Square) and the Mark (too snooty).  I 
stayed two other places I didn't like, but the names escape me.

I've seen some other smaller hotels which look nice, and if I check a map I 
might remember the names.

regarding a proposed set of affiliate transaction rules for gas utilities.
Enron Energy Services, peoples and others filed comments. Based on the
comments, Staff circulated a proposed rule but there was no immediate
follow-up. The Commission issued a notice indicating that it would further
review the matter after its January, 2000 gas policy meeting. Thereafter,
in August, 2000, the ICC Staff submiited a Report recommending that a rule
be adopted. On Sept. 22, 2000, the rule was published for "first notice" in
the Illinois Register. The ICC also initiated Docket 00-0586 to review the
rules. In Docket 00-0586, the assigned Hearing Examiner determined that no
hearings would be held to review the rules. As a result, only written
comments were considered. Several parties (including Peoples/North Shore)
filed comments (although Enron did not). The Examiner issued a Proposed
Order on April 23, which-if adopted-would direct publication of the rules
for "second notice" (45 days for the Joint Comm. on Admin. Rules to comment
before final effectiveness). The issues raised by the comment s are
summarized in the Proposed Order. Exceptions to the Proposed Order (i.e.,
comments regarding the proposed decision) are due May 11 and replies to
Excpetions are due May 18. The Examiner did not attach the modified rule,
but notes that the few changes made to Staff's initial draft are discussed
in the order. I will fax to you the Proposed Order and Staff initial draft
rule. The next step in the process is ICC review of the Proposed Order,
followed presumably by Illinois Register Publicaion of the adopted rule.

Kay-I have reviewed the GE acknowledgment, and I believe it does everything
InterGen would want in that GE permits the multiple transfers all the way to
the project company (Larkspur) and GE acknowledges that the transfers will
not result in a breach of the Facility Agreements.  I have also reviewed the
unanimous consents and find them to be OK.

I propose going back to George with the proposal that simultaneously with
the execution of the unanimous consent that ENA be permitted to exercise its
puts under the two LLC, which can be done with InterGen's consent and
InterGen's receipt of an acknowledgment from GE that the exercise of the put
will not in any manner prejudice the rights under the Facility Agreements
(which in view of the transfer of the turbines and the Facility Agreements
being permitted by GE, such a request may be superfluous, but I'd like to
have it anyway).

I considered also recommending a release from ENA's obligations under the
Letter Agreements, but I think that may be pushing too far.

Let me know your thoughts.

Regards

John

Both of these are capitalized terms in rev 23.  Is there a difference?  Load

the first part of Sec.77-5-725(u) supports your statement ("to purchase...on 
behalf of its members"). To me, that might support buying as agent in a way 
that the action of MDEA would be a binding commitment of CPU. However,  the 
second clause ("and to sell the same to its members") would seem to go the 
other way.

Also note subsections o, p and q.

Under municipal law in Miss. there is the concept that a public body may not 
"delegate" its statutory functions to others. I know you can't do it when 
it's a discretionary public function being delegated to a non-public entity. 
I'm not so sure about one public body delegating to another. I'd like to hear 
from David Hunt on this.

>>> <Kay.Mann@enron.com> 06/06/01 03:42PM >>>

Would you read that to mean the authority to buy power "as agent for" the
Cities?  Seems not entirely clear but not entirely out of the question.

Kay

There are two critical issues to address in interconnect agreements - one
is the inclusion of  a "notice to proceed" concept before obligations are
triggered under the Interconnection Agreement (this effectively renders the
agreement an option) and the inclusion of text that relates to Turbopark,
ie, broad assignment language and providing an alternative form of security
(Turbopark cannot provide such guaranties).

A couple weeks ago I received a call from Karla Hesketh of ABB- she was 
checking on the status of ABB Invoice #  TS 00365 in the amount of $105,104.

The invoice was for heavy hauling of 2 Transformers for the City of Austin 
Tranformerss.

The invoice was sent to   Enron, city of Austin,  14000 Smith Street   #2957E.

I had left a voice mail for you on this- but less descriptive.  

I have a fax copy of the invoice that Karla sent to me today.


Who is the action person on this?

Would you all be in a posiotion to get together tomorrow morning at 9:30 am 
Houston time to review the issues list and  talk about how we get to the end 
of this process with GE.  We immediately need to start the drafting of the 
Longview turbine contract and I'd like to see if we are close enough to get 
that started.  Scott, today the extension to the Agreement in Principle 
expires and we need to extend.  Can you tee this up with Steve Swift?  Our 
meeting tomorrow will be in lieu of the regularly scheduled GE call.  I'll 
let them know we will call them later this week or we'll talk next Wednesday, 
but I would like to get through whatever we need to in order to get the 
Longview Turbine Contract going.  
I've talked to John Schwartzenburg about this and he is available tomorrow 
morning.

I hear you are working on the Midway deal.  Me, too.   I want to go back to

it Burns, something like that?).

I look forward to working with you on this one.

Ben,

I made a minor adjustment to the LOI re: exclusivity.    

 << File: Midway TECO LOI june 1.doc >> 

Policy states that any time we sign up to exclusivity we are supposed to get 
it approved by Mark Metts, Tim Detmering and the CEO of the affected business 
unit.  Seems a little silly in this case, but it can't hurt. (yes, I know we 
didn't do it with the turbine stuff)

GE thinks that once we finalize the terms of this contract that this contract 
will form the basis for future purchases by Enron and not just ENA.  Do we 
need to involve other Enron biz units in the sign off process?

Hi there.

I am attaching for the group's consideration a red line that I ran comparing 
the current working draft (v4) with the draft John R. recently circulated to 
Tax and Insurance. 

I suggest that Pete Thompson keep the typewriter on this.  We are getting so 
close to the end, I would really like to try to avoid confusion.  

I am also attaching a clean copy of the current active version, and the 
current list of issues under consideration.  I suggest we work through this 
list and turn another draft before soliciting Cris/Herman and Lisa's 
comments.  We should also give the ENA commercial reps the opportunity to 
review it at that time.


Kay

Ann Elizabeth,

Lisa Bills has requested some additional changes to the "form" of Option 
Agreement I sent you yesterday.  If you will e-mail the form of Option 
Agreement for the new Florida Option to Kay Mann, she will make the necessary 
changes.  Also Ben Jacoby has indicated that  wants to see all new Option 
Agreements prior to them being sent out to anyone so he can be in the loop.

Sorry you missed our meeting.

Ann Elizabeth,

This may not be the absolute latest Form of Option, but it should be pretty 
darn close to being totally blessed (by Herman Manis).  I am also attaching a 
form of Memorandum of Option just in case you need it.

Ed, thanks for the comment.  Dale is in the process of either closing or 
getting near to closing the ABB E Next Breakout contract with ENA-Houston.  I 
am forwarding your note for consideration.  Exhibits P & Q are "Not Used" 
pages. I see no problem in pulling them out unless it means renumbering which 
mean legal time.  If just a place holder, I'd rather get the breakout 
agreements done than make any changes at all.

Cheery bye

Bill W.

Hi there,

I believe Chris should be back today, so I wanted to follow up on this.

I don't have any recollection of where we left the escrow agreement with
NW.  Please get with MKahn or Jerry DeBerry to see if we can get consensus
on the current form of escrow agreement.  Once we have that, Enron (Chris)
will make contact with Citibank.

Thanks,

Kay

I see that.  She's not real fast on approving things either.  I've submitted 
your expense report and Carol's to her.  She hasn't gotten to Carol's yet, 
and I did it a few days ago.  Haedicke isn't that fast either.  I don't think 
they like all this automation, but it really makes it so much quicker.  I'm 
going to be the queen at invoices and expense reports because I do so many of 
them.  I like both systems, but then I'm very adaptable.  

Did you give me an ok review?

Kay, I called Cingular to see what was up with your bill.  The last payment 
was made the end of March.  Your credit card expired March, 2001.  So, you 
are not set up currently for your credit card to be charged.  I'm going to go 
ahead and expense this charge and then you'll need to pay it.  If you want it 
set up again on your credit card, you have to send Cingular a letter stating 
your wishes.

I also changed your address to this building while I had her on the phone.

Is all of this ok with you?>

I can't do it that week. I'm on travel black out because my wife is going 
away for the week and I have the home duty (first time she's ever done this 
in 6 years so I probably need to let her go - as if I had any say!).

How about something the following week?

Kay:

George Kutzschbach of Fulbright called this afternoon to request copies of
the executed Assignment and Assumption Agreements and Bills of Sale for the
turbine/transformer transaction between ENA and Sweetgum Energy LP.  George
has unsigned copies of these documents.  Our closing volumes also contain
only unsigned copies of these documents.

George is asking for the documents with respect to both the turbines and the
transformer, but is needing them specifically for the transformer.
Apparently, CA-II is planning to sell the transformer, and he is gathering
up the documents that would show title to the transformer in CA-II.

I have reviewed the documents, and do not see any reason why we should not
deliver them.  Can you provide signed copies of these documents?   Thanks.

As a matter of convenience, John simply sent to Matt his working version of 
the contract.  This particular draft included some  of his suggested changes 
to those sections dealing with default as well as some of the cleanup that we 
discussed re performance guarantees, LD's, ect. but should not impact the tax 
analysis.  By the way, John has run his comments re the default sections by 
me and has also sent them to you for comment before we launch to GE.  Do you 
have any additional comments re his rewrite on the default provisions?    

Agree that there should only be one draft (controlled by Peter) and in fact, 
John is in the process of sending Peter an Email today, if time permits, re 
his suggested changes so that they can be incorporated into the PT contract 
draft.  

Also, was there any consensus on the time for the weekly call tomorrow?

John,

I noticed a different file name on this draft than the version Pete Thompson 
sent out.  How is this version different from Pete's?  I sure hate to have 
more than one version of this monster being vetted at the same time.

Ok, sending it in now.  Have you officially been changed to Elizabeth's cost 
center?  You aren't in Jeff's time site any more.  I want to make sure I send 
it to the correct person.

Subject: Cingular Bill

Kay, I called Cingular to see what was up with your bill.  The last payment 
was made the end of March.  Your credit card expired March, 2001.  So, you 
are not set up currently for your credit card to be charged.  I'm going to go 
ahead and expense this charge and then you'll need to pay it.  If you want it 
set up again on your credit card, you have to send Cingular a letter stating 
your wishes.

I also changed your address to this building while I had her on the phone.

Is all of this ok with you?>

Enron may have a land lease with Project Co.  In NO event may the land be 
burdened with low dollar hard costs/improvements - no materiality limits and 
no hard costs allowed.

Question for the team:

If it appears that we may have land which may not be able to stay off balance 
sheet, is it preferable to have the land held by a different LLC than the 
project LLC, with a lease to the E-Next/OBS compliant project co?  

If that is the case, what about the possibility of burdening the land with 
some low dollar hard costs?  I don't have anything in particular in mind, it 
is more of a theoretical question.

Thanks,

Kay

11 should be fine.  Jake called.  He wants to go to dinner tomorrow.  
Actually, he wants Ben to take us to dinner (I am going to invite Ben).

The list includes:

You
Me
Caroline
Carlos
Jake
Ben
Fred

Can you make it and ask Caroline if she can make it?  Can you think of anyone 
else?

Does Pappas Steakhouse sound OK?

Good morning.

In order to finish up Delta/Salmon tomorrow, please note we need the 
following today:

GE parent guaranty
LOC (so that full payment can be made to GE tomorrow)
Opinion of counsel

And once funds are received by GE, we need the receipt of funds letter.

Lee, I haven't heard back from the Portland gang to find out if the LV Co Gen 
contract is ready.  Maybe Jake can help shake that loose.

Thanks,

Kay

GE thinks that once we finalize the terms of this contract that this contract 
will form the basis for future purchases by Enron and not just ENA.  Do we 
need to involve other Enron biz units in the sign off process?

Hi there.

I am attaching for the group's consideration a red line that I ran comparing 
the current working draft (v4) with the draft John R. recently circulated to 
Tax and Insurance. 

I suggest that Pete Thompson keep the typewriter on this.  We are getting so 
close to the end, I would really like to try to avoid confusion.  

I am also attaching a clean copy of the current active version, and the 
current list of issues under consideration.  I suggest we work through this 
list and turn another draft before soliciting Cris/Herman and Lisa's 
comments.  We should also give the ENA commercial reps the opportunity to 
review it at that time.


Kay

Never stayed there.  My current favorite is the Omni, which is in one of may

can buy reasonably priced bagels, cokes, etc.  Last year I also stayed at the 
Marriott Marquis (BIG, right on Times Square) and the Mark (too snooty).  I 
stayed two other places I didn't like, but the names escape me.

I've seen some other smaller hotels which look nice, and if I check a map I 
might remember the names.

ENA's offices with Peter Thompson, Lisa Bills et al to get the B/O contracts

Peter is in favor, and I certainly think its time to stop e mailing back and

I do not necessarily anticipate a problem, but because I believe that Enron 
is considering the possibility of entering into another transaction with 
Ameresco, I have asked Lance Schuler to make sure that there is no conflict 
or other unintended result.  Having said that, I have no substantative 
problem with the provision addressed by Kay's email.  But let's make sure we 
run this one trap first.

Subject: Confidentiality agreement

Gentlemen,

I'm with EWS Legal, and I'm working with John Llodra (East Power origination) 
concerning a confidentiality agreement with Ameresco.  The proposed 
transaction is described as follows:

 A potential power plant site development and asset management services 
related to the Island End Generation Project, a nominal  365 MW combined 
cycle power generation facility, proposed to be located in Everett, 
Massachusetts.

The current draft of the CA contains this language:

Thanks. I put in a call to those guys and am waiting to hear back. In the 
meantime, maybe you could call their in house counsel to get reaquainted 
since you've already worked together...

One other item - the Pompano developers agreement - I need to talk to you 
about this tomorrow (early if possible) as local counsel is waiting for our 
comments. I heard rumor that AEW was still working on this despite her 
vacation. In any case, we need to get some comments back to Debbie Orshefsky 
on Thursday if possible.

Thanks much for the comments. Here's my preliminary response:

1. Done, and will add a definition of Effective Date
2. Will propose change to city.
3. OK - done.
4. Power plants are normally deemed to be factories for this purpose.
5. They promise to send us each a card and fruit cake each Christmas (just 
kidding). Your point is understood, but this is a small commercial point 
relative to the overall deal.
6. Will propose change to city.
7. Ties to definition of Effective Date, which we will propose as requiring 
the passage of a resolution.
8. Sections will be added.

I'll send you the redraft as soon as we get it. Thanks again.

Ben

Subject: RE: Deerfield development agreement

I have since met with Ben on this agreement but wanted to let you see my 
comments as you are incorporating Deerfield's changes.  I was in meetings all 
day and just realized that I never sent this out.

Finance comments.  I have left a message with Rose asking what her comments 
to you were so we could coordinate.  Since I haven't heard from her yet I 
will provide these and follow-up if there are any others which need 
mentioning after I speak with her.

1.  The Effective Date needs to change to "2001"

2.  In Section 2 Landscaping: To avoid any accounting issues raised by 
Accounting, it would be very helpful and along the intent as you indicated to 
Billy, if you would add at the beginning: "After commencement of construction 
of the Facility but prior to the issuance of a CofO......."

3.  Section 4 needs to have a global search done to change all the "PBEC"s to 
"DBEC"s.

4.  Section 6:  Is the Facility truly deemed a "Factory" for permitting fees 
or are we changing the normal classification for a power plant in this 
agreement?

5.  Section 7(b):  Will we be charging the City for the easement for their 
cellular tower?  What is the consideration otherwise for doing so since we 
are paying them all sorts of money for the other items for which we are using 
the City?

 Extra period at the end of this Section.

6.  In the Termination Section can we put in the language from Pompano Beach 
which said that if the Agreement is terminated, all parties relieved of their 
obligations and an instrument would be recorded with County (offset to 
initial recordation of Agreement) indicating that Ag terminated and all 
obligations of the parties have been released?

7.  Does the City need to obtain any approvals prior to execution or at any 
other time to execute and have this be a valid agreement on their part?

8.  I noted that there is no Notices section nor Counterparts section.  Are 
they truly not needed here?  Execution occurring in same place on same doc?

Billy, 

It is expected that by the time the hard costs referenced in #2 are incurred, 
the project will be in E Next (or its successor/take out vehicle) since 
construction will be nearly complete.  Costs incurred in #3 should be Phase 2 
E Next costs, since this should be in the construction period, although it 
could be immediately prior to that time.  

Lisa, I skipped Rose on this email since she is out of town, and reviewed 
this agreement before she left.

The bank will issue the LOC by the end of next week, perhaps as early as

Also, do you want new invoices?  If so, will one for $1,502,355 be

   For the B&V folks, I need names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers,
   (nice,
   but not required).

   Just a reminder, the site change process can not start until the new
   site
   conditions are identified to GE.  The cost and cycle estimate then takes
   about 4 weeks.

1.0  John A and Armando.

My question and John's response has led me down the following merry chase:

The LM6000 contract has GE keeping risk of loss and damage until delivery to 
the Delivery Point.   The Delivery Point is Jacinto Port.   Without any other 
documents, GE has delivered the equipment and Risk of Loss and Damage is 
Brazilian Trust's.   I understand that some deal was cut in a letter that Ben 
Jacoby sent to GE where GE keeps the ROL while in storage, but there are some 
storage costs.

(Note:) We have a very painful experience on a turbine from another vendor 
where the point and time of transfer of risk of loss is a central issue to a 
dispute at hand.) 

I think we need clear documentation making it clear that GE has ROL for the 
equipment until we take it out of storage.

As it relates to NEPCO if I understand it correctly the risk of loss chain is 
as follows: GE delivers to the Jacinto port where Risk of loss transfers to 
Brazilian Trust,  Brazilian Trust delivers to the port  and keeps risk of 
loss until Ex Terra, at which point risk of loss under the Turbine Purchase 
Agreement transfers to NEPCO, but under the EPC contract SFE assumes risk of 
loss at ExTerra.  Thus NEPCO does not have a risk of loss exposure.  

I can see how NEPCO transports from Exterra to the Site under the EPC 
contract and is protected by clause 8.1 of the EPC Contract. 

 Under what authority is NEPCO transporting the equipment from the GE 
delivery point to Exterra, has Brazilian Trust engaged NEPCO to do so?  The 
Turbine Purchase Agreement does not contemplate this.

2.0  David Gohlke-  I think we have a small hole that needs and can be easily 
filled.  In the Turbine Purchase Agreement, can we have NEPCO perform 
transport service from the GE delivery point to Exterra but BT keeps ROL.

3.0 I think from a GE perspective,  the Enron family takes ROL from GE at 
Jacinto port and gets the turbines delivered to  the Site.  

4.0  Kay Mann - I really need a copy of the Ben letter- we start moving 
equipment shortly- I need to make sure that the ROL issue with GE is 
adequately covered.

John, call Pam Blande for the exact details.  It is a custom broker by the 
name of Fritz, but she will gladly give you the details.  NEPCO via a 
sub-contract moves the material out of the GE storage, to the ship, load on 
the ship, ocean shipment, unloading at Sepitiba, transport to the site, 
custom clearance, and then NEPCO unloads from the heavy hauller onto the pads.
Pam has all of the details.

Kay, I called Cingular to see what was up with your bill.  The last payment 
was made the end of March.  Your credit card expired March, 2001.  So, you 
are not set up currently for your credit card to be charged.  I'm going to go 
ahead and expense this charge and then you'll need to pay it.  If you want it 
set up again on your credit card, you have to send Cingular a letter stating 
your wishes.

I also changed your address to this building while I had her on the phone.

Is all of this ok with you?>

		 Subject: RE: Rev5 of the GE World Hunger T&Cs

The problem as I see it with respect to a material default argument is that 
Article 16 re TD&I doesn't set a standard as to how/when such services will 
be furnished by GE.  Does Ex. H-1 set forth such criteria or does it merely 
describe the types of services furnished?  

Maybe in Article 16 we could try to put similar timing and cover  provisions 
as found in Article 14 re GE's warranty obligations. 

As we all know presently TD&I is a touchy subject with all the GTG vendors as 
a result of record equipment orders and lack of qualified technical reps.

I agree that the LD's don't apply as presently drafted and that we should 
discuss internally with the team before we launch back our position to GE.  
Any suggestions from the rest of the group?

John my only comments are in article 12 - do not be so specific in naming 
policy number and date.  ENA changes its policy - we'd need to revise the 
agreement.

Also - in Article 16 - is there a way to say lack of TDI support would be a 
default condition and may be cause for penalty LDs?  We are hearing some 
stories where GE is so short on being able to supply TDI - that weeks have 
gone by where installation of the GTs are delayed.  Are there any provision 
ties to LDs associated with Article 16? If not - we need them.

I will check on the status of this. The ICC Staff's work on affiliate rules
had been side-tracked when I last looked at this. They may have started
moving again.

Kay-

Go ahead and issue the breakout contract as is for the LM6000's at Austin.  I 
will give you some wording for a change order to increase the number of TD of 
I hours and days of per diem.  The way the contract is written, it will save 
us money to issue a change order as opposed to changing the base number of 
hours in the contract.

Sections 2.0 and 8.0 of Exhibit H-1 states that over time hours within the 
original 240 hour total are deduducted at time and a half.  Total TD of I 
hours worked in excess of the 240 hour total are only marked up by 22%.  
(Straight time = $135/hr, overtime = $165/hr)  

I will give you some wording as soon as I get an estimate from the field on 
how many days of per diem will be used.

Thanks,
Eric Booth

My prior email was written before I read this and it seems like everyone is 
geared up for the call with GE tomorrow.  I'm OK with proceeding if everyone 
thinks we can resolve some stuff.

		 Subject: World Hunger Rev 4a- JR

  I took several assignments from the last World Hunger call.  Status as 
follows:

a.   Tax language-  I have sent a prior version of Rev 4 jr to Matt G asking 
him to call me to let me know when he can talk with GE tax rep.  Steve Swifit 
and I are in London and would like to sit in on that call.

b.   Insurance Language review.   I sent same version to David Marshall and 
Paul Parrish asking for their reviews and opinion as to whether 7FA's are new 
technology.

c.   I "volunteered" to look at the termination language in world hunger, GE 
had some problems, and I had the same problem with the ARCOs contract.   I 
drafted a fix last Friday, sent to Kay M for comment.  I have included my 
suggested changes in the attached redline.  I have forwarded same fix to GE 
at end Friday for Arcos.    I have asked Kay if she still has a concern with 
the Limit of Liability as it relates to termination.  I think it works.

d.  I "volunteered" to work over Article 10, Exhibit B-3 and Exhibit B-6 in 
relation to Guarantees and liquidated damages.  I have done that in the 
attached redline of the T&C and Exhibits.

e. Some time ago I volunteered to resurrect the language associated with the 
reduction in the LD refund in Section 10.9.8.   I had sent out a couple weeks 
ago but received no reaction.    I have entered that fix in the attached 
redline.

f.  I have made several minor changes to definitions associated with 
performance.

Attached is Rev4-JR version of GE T&C's and Exhibits for world hunger.  They 
start from the clean rev 4 version of the T&Cs that Peter forwarded to me at 
my request.  The attached are redlined to show my changes.

I have not sent any of this to GE except for the termination language fix.   
I suggest that the Enron team give these a quick read before the World hunger 
call.  I can print same here and share with GE during the call unless there 
is an objection.  

I hope this will help to advance the process.  My earlier emails to Paul and 
Matt were not intended confuse the situation with different drafts.  Please 
ignore those and for the above purposes use the attached files.


Kay- I suggest that you forward to others who you feel appropriate for the 
purposes of the world hunger call on Wednesday.

Yes we do want to renew the option through September of next year and we will 
need to persuade them to lower the option premium.  Her is a thought:  the 
land fill closure cost is approximately $2.9 million.  Could we create a new 
option agreement that states that the strike price is $4.2 million ($1.3 the 
original strike price plus the cost of land fill closure cost) so we could 
pay an option premium of up to $210,000 (5% of $4.2 million).  At closing, we 
reduce the purchase price by the costs yet to be incurred in the closing the 
land fill.  Since Certosa Holdings will not start the closure until they are 
assured that we will exercise the option if even then, the net cost to us 
would drop back to  the original strike price.  Could we get this past the 
accountants?

Only the memorandum of option was recorded.

I've skimmed it.  I see that the option expires August 9th.  Are we planning 
to renew it?  If so maybe we can renew early and fix what we can to preserve 
some optionality (no pun intended) and cover the fee issue.  Might take too 
long to address the immediate issue.

I don't see anyway we can get around the balance sheet issue unless we let 
the option expire and then reoption, but in that case the option payment 
would have to be smaller (acct says an option of 5% creates a problem as it 
would be considered a down payment).  Just fyi.

Kathleen, was the option recorded, or just a memo of option, or neither?  I'm 
just wondering what is public info.

Herman is out of the office today, but I can discuss the fee issue to get his 
vote.  

More to come...

I think the invoice was for between $20,000 and $30,000, but I can't 
remember.  AEW has the invoice.  This probably will not be the final as we 
will need to work with them in discussions with DERM on delaying the landfill 
closure and in moving jurisdiction of the project from CZAB to the County 
Commissioners.   I think Shutts & Bowen (who may get stiffed by their client 
if this deal blows up) and Certosa Holdings would be open to any suggestions 
and we need to renegotiate the option anyway.  Shall I call and suggest this 
this flat fee for retooling the option agreement to them or shall we do it 
together?  I,m not sure I could explain to them acequately the idiosyncrasies 
of our accounting requirements.

How much is it and should this be the final amount?  One thought I have is 
that maybe we can retool the option agreement so that we pay them a flat fee, 
which is enough to cover the expenditures.  Don't know if this works, but it 
is one thought.  What do you think?

One more thing on the SDEC project:  According to the option agreement we 
executed last October, we agreed to reimburse Certosa Holdings for actual 
third party costs that they incurred in support of our necessary 
applications, submittals and in seeking local approval.  Several weeks ago, 
we recieved an invoice from Shutts & Bowen, attorney for Certosa Holdings 
requesting reimbursement pursuant to the contract.  I forwarded this invoice 
on th Ann Elizabeth not necessarily to pay for but to review considering this 
whole soft cost hard cost discussion.  I recieved another call this morning 
from Shutts & Bowen asking about the invoice.  What should I do?

Ann Elizabeth did not provide a designated hitter for the South Dade Energy 
Center (Dade Development Company LLC is Optionee, Certosa Holdings is 
Optionor) nor did she provide one for tne Medley Dunn project.  I have been 
told that the Dunns are considering backing off their ultimatums that they 
gave Ann Elizabeth and I regarding taxes to the town and assumption of 
enviromental liability.  Who do I talk to about the Dunn contract while Ann

Kay Mann is the designated hitter for the Pompano and Deerfied projects while 
I'm on vacation.  I've given her a down load of the status of Greg and 
Steve's projects.  Chris Boehler at A&K will be the designated hitter for 
Midway.  I'm not going to check my voice mail while I'm gone but, if 
necessary, here are the contact numbers while I'm gone.

Walter and Marlena Schilling  011-49-8218-89351 schilling.jun@freenet.de

Monika and Bernhard Steinacher 011-49-8232-8932 m.steinacher@schwabmuenchen.de

If you call, Walter and Bernhard and Bernhard's daughter, Susanne, speak very 
good English.  Monika's isn't bad.  Marlena may get flustered and hang up on 
you.

Best of luck at Deerfield and hope to see Pompano on track when I get back in 
the office on June 11th.  Kay is planning on going to Florida on June 12 for 
the moratorium hearing and the rezoning hearing.

I don't know if I'll be able to go.  Girl, I'm so tired now and have so much 
to do for the trip (haven't done anything).  If I don't make it, please wish 
Paige a very happy birthday for me.  I also hope Roscoe is ok and Neil too.  
I don't guess you've heard anything as to your test results.

Kay,

A few weeks ago I spoke with John Keffer regarding Sweetgum Energy LLC's
request that Ben Jacoby sign unanimous resolutions of CAED I & II approving
the sale by CAED I and II of their respective GE turbines to Sweetgum.  As
of today, Sweetgum has not received back the resolutions signed by Ben. As I
explained to John, Sweetgum and InterGen would appreciate Ben's prompt
execution and return of the resolutions.  If Enron does not wish for Ben to
sign the resolutions, then Sweetgum and InterGen would appreciate your
advising us of that as soon as possible.

As I explained to John, Sweetgum would like to have unanimous resolutions as
this is more customary and cleaner, however, since Ben received the required
3 business days prior notice of the proposed resolutions, the resolutions
only need the majority approval of the board members.

I would appreciate hearing back from you at your earliest convenience.

George

Ben

The Turbopark funds request for all payments to be made next month needs to 
be submitted by Tuesday, June 12th.  This request covers the period from June 
15th to July 15th.  Are we planning to pay the $1.5 MM invoice from GE during 
this time period?  If so, I will have accounting request the funds.  If we're 
not sure if the payment will be made or not, it is better not to request the 
funds.  In this case, the payment can be treated as an "actual" for that 
month and backed out of the advance for next month.  Please let me know which 
course of action you would like to take.  

Thanks,
Rebecca

Thanks Peter for new revision 6 to the form agreement.

A minor detail: Pursuant to somewhat recent changes to New York law, we 
should add in Section 28.2 "pursuant to New York General Obligations Law 
Section 5-1401," after "with this Agreement," in the 2nd line (unless anyone 
objects).  I believe such change will benefit both parties and simply 
reinforces that New York is the controlling law.

Never stayed there.  My current favorite is the Omni, which is in one of may 
favorite locations. It has a little deli like shop across the street, where I 
can buy reasonably priced bagels, cokes, etc.  Last year I also stayed at the 
Marriott Marquis (BIG, right on Times Square) and the Mark (too snooty).  I 
stayed two other places I didn't like, but the names escape me.

I've seen some other smaller hotels which look nice, and if I check a map I 
might remember the names.

The lenders have specifically asked for an original of the Letter Agreement.
If it is really problematic to get another 2 copies signed, I can ask them
again if they will accept a copy.  I appreciate that there are only 2
parties to the document, but the lenders' reasoning is that the Letter
Agreement is a key underlying document and as such, they would expect to
have an original.  Also, our original arrangement was that we would sign 6
originals of each relevant document so that all parties could have
originals.

I know what a pain it is to get documents re-executed and I apologize that
this request has come so late in the day.

Regards
Isabel

ENA signed two originals of the Letter Agreement (as the Letter Agreement
has only two parties).  I kept one for ENA and provided the other to Greg
Lang for PPL by letter dated May 2, 2001.  I still do not have an original
of PPL's signature, but Greg Lang did provide a fax copy.    Is it necessary
for the parties to sign additional copies for non-parties?   I am checking
with ENA on the GE documents.  Thanks.

Ben,

Your voice-mail requesting a new corporate guarantee is making this
transaction increasingly burdensome for us, unsettling the balance I
thought we had reached.  Call me tonight when you are out of your
hearings.  603-493-3314.

In the meantime, I'll review the doc's.

Chris:

My comments are as follows, and I'd like you to send a letter rather than an 
e-mail:

Dear Jeff,

As a follow up  to your letter dated May 9, 2001, upon the posting of an LC 
in the amount of $965,855 representing 5% of the price of unit 1, we are 
prepared to pay GE the $1,501,885 deducted from our last payment. With 
respect to liquidated damages on delivery of the air filter, we reserve our 
rights under the contract to exercise our offset rights at a later date.

Please let me know when you will be able to have the LC in place, and we will 
make appropriate payment arrangements.

Regards,

Chris Booth
Manager

Kay and Ben,

I would like to send the following to Jeff Darst at GE via e-mail.

Dear Jeff,

Pursuant to you letter dated May 9, 2001 we are prepared to pay the deduct 
for liquidated damages ($536,000) and retention deduct ($965,885) withheld 
from the April 25, 2001 invoice.  Payment of the deduct for the liquidated 
damages claim does not constitute a withdrawal of the claim, hence, we are 
not waiving our rights afforded under the contract.  As stated in our letter 
dated May 3, 2001, we are prepared to pay the final 5% payment for Unit 1 
upon receipt of the Letter of Credit for $965,855 (5% of the price for Unit 
1) and a lien release. 

Regards,

Chris

Greg and Kay:

Enclosed are clean and blacklined copies of the escrow disbursement
instruction letter, marked to reflect revisions from the draft previously
circulated this morning.  The revisions address Citibank's comments, as
Citibank questioned why the bulk of the funds would be distributed to
someone that had not been mentioned in the escrow agreement.  We resolved
Citibank's concern with a short reference to the April 4 letter agreement.
The signature page of the instruction letter is not affected by this change.
If you have any questions or comments, please call.  Thank you.

I was a finally able to talk to Mike Young and e advised that they are 
looking at several financing options and are still on track to close on or 
before 15 July 2001.  He said that there were no issues that needed to be 
addressed between ENA and NorthWestern at this time.

If we buy the property before the LLC is owned by ENext, wouldn't the big 
concern be that we've put $1.8 million of land plus an additional $900,000 or 
so of obligations to build road and stormwater system on the balance rather 
than the rather small ongoing costs related to maintainance of the road and 
system?

As I understand it, if the option is exercised (and the property bought) 
prior to the time the LLC is owned by ENext, there is a balance sheet 
impact.

Probable time for them to bless the agreements; however, since these 
documents will not be executed until after closing, the obligations created 
under the Property Owners Association should not have a balance sheet impact.

Kay,

A&K did the title committment work and is now working on the Property 
Association Documents (as is Greenberg Traurig in West Palm Beach).  Ann 
Elizabeth's
last email message to me before she went on vacation was that A&K was the 
designated hitter for the Midway Project.    You have been copied on those 
docs which we desparately need to get to Cooney Midway Groves, the property 
owner.  As far as I know, they have not been involved in anything else 
related to Midway this year.

Christi left me a message saying that Lloyd Will or one of his guys needs to 
review the Interconnction Agreement. I do not know Lloyd.

Greg

PS we had a good meeting with DERM on the landfill closure issues in the 
Certosa Holdings deal.   I'll try to reach you this afternoon to discuss.

Oh yeah, I was outside all weekend.  Yesterday I painted one of my birdbaths 
(it was pretty ugly - just grey concrete), now the bath part is blue with a 
yellow center (its a flower bath) and I will have to paint the base next 
weekend.  No kayaking though.  Ole Norm partied just a little too hard on 
Saturday night and had to fly out to Midland yesterday afternoon.

I think my eggplant died.  I must have planted it on the new, worthless dirt 
side.

I thought of you yesterday.  I planted an eggplant plant and a pepper plant.  
What a great weekend - I lived outside.  What about you?

Subject: Confidentiality agreement

Gentlemen,

I'm with EWS Legal, and I'm working with John Llodra (East Power origination) 
concerning a confidentiality agreement with Ameresco.  The proposed 
transaction is described as follows:

 A potential power plant site development and asset management services 
related to the Island End Generation Project, a nominal  365 MW combined 
cycle power generation facility, proposed to be located in Everett, 
Massachusetts.

The current draft of the CA contains this language:

 From the time of the signing of this Agreement until October 1, 2001 neither 
Party shall pursue the Proposed Transaction without  the participation of the 
other Party, unless the other Party consents in writing or notifies the other 
Party that it does not intend to   pursue the Proposed Transaction.

In accordance with policy, this issue is being submitted to you for your 
review.  

John can be contacted at 978 449 9936.  My extension is 57566.

Thank you,

Kay

Here is the entire CA:

regularly scheduled call on Wednesday.  If you all would push this along in 
my absence, I will ask Suzanne Adams to send out the reminder memo to the

applied to the Longview turbine purchase.  Thanks!

Ben,

I made a minor adjustment to the LOI re: exclusivity.    

 << File: Midway TECO LOI june 1.doc >> 

Policy states that any time we sign up to exclusivity we are supposed to get 
it approved by Mark Metts, Tim Detmering and the CEO of the affected business 
unit.  Seems a little silly in this case, but it can't hurt. (yes, I know we 
didn't do it with the turbine stuff)

Probable time for them to bless the agreements; however, since these 
documents will not be executed until after closing, the obligations created 
under the Property Owners Association should not have a balance sheet impact.

Kay,

A&K did the title committment work and is now working on the Property 
Association Documents (as is Greenberg Traurig in West Palm Beach).  Ann 
Elizabeth's
last email message to me before she went on vacation was that A&K was the 
designated hitter for the Midway Project.    You have been copied on those 
docs which we desparately need to get to Cooney Midway Groves, the property 
owner.  As far as I know, they have not been involved in anything else 
related to Midway this year.

Christi left me a message saying that Lloyd Will or one of his guys needs to 
review the Interconnction Agreement. I do not know Lloyd.

PS we had a good meeting with DERM on the landfill closure issues in the 
Certosa Holdings deal.   I'll try to reach you this afternoon to discuss.

Does the first option need to expire or can we terminate prior to expiration 
and concurrent with execution of a new option agreement?  I got a call from 
the owner of Certosa Holdings pleading for help on reimbursement of those 
legal fees.   If we are going to pay a flat fee and renegotiate this 
agreement, I think we need to do so quickly.   Regardless, I need to tell 
them something soon.  They are getting desparate.  I've a call in to Taffy 
Milligan. AEW's assistant to locate the Shutts & Bowen invoice.  

I understand we have engaged Shutts & Bowen in Tallahassee to review some 
property tax issue.  Cound this be an avenue to avoid this on balance sheet 
hard cost thang?

Unless the first option expires (and the original premium is expensed), you 
add the original payment to the renewal premium to determine the percentage.  
If we can't beat the percentage game, we can have the land on the balance 
sheet and that won't put the entire project on it.  Don't ask me to splain 
that, because I can't.  If the land is going to be on the balance sheet, you 
would think that it would be better to have $1.3 on than $4.2.  However, one 
thing I don't know (haven't asked) is what the environmental restrictions are 
with our financing vehicle.  I don't know if the land has to be clean before 
it can go into the vehicle.  I can ask.  If it is required to be clean, then 
you may be back to the $4.2 anyway.

Subject: RE: AEW's backup

Yes we do want to renew the option through September of next year and we will 
need to persuade them to lower the option premium.  Her is a thought:  the 
land fill closure cost is approximately $2.9 million.  Could we create a new 
option agreement that states that the strike price is $4.2 million ($1.3 the 
original strike price plus the cost of land fill closure cost) so we could 
pay an option premium of up to $210,000 (5% of $4.2 million).  At closing, we 
reduce the purchase price by the costs yet to be incurred in the closing the 
land fill.  Since Certosa Holdings will not start the closure until they are 
assured that we will exercise the option if even then, the net cost to us 
would drop back to  the original strike price.  Could we get this past the 
accountants?

Only the memorandum of option was recorded.

I've skimmed it.  I see that the option expires August 9th.  Are we planning 
to renew it?  If so maybe we can renew early and fix what we can to preserve 
some optionality (no pun intended) and cover the fee issue.  Might take too 
long to address the immediate issue.

I don't see anyway we can get around the balance sheet issue unless we let 
the option expire and then reoption, but in that case the option payment 
would have to be smaller (acct says an option of 5% creates a problem as it 
would be considered a down payment).  Just fyi.

Kathleen, was the option recorded, or just a memo of option, or neither?  I'm 
just wondering what is public info.

Herman is out of the office today, but I can discuss the fee issue to get his 
vote.  

More to come...

I think the invoice was for between $20,000 and $30,000, but I can't 
remember.  AEW has the invoice.  This probably will not be the final as we 
will need to work with them in discussions with DERM on delaying the landfill 
closure and in moving jurisdiction of the project from CZAB to the County 
Commissioners.   I think Shutts & Bowen (who may get stiffed by their client 
if this deal blows up) and Certosa Holdings would be open to any suggestions 
and we need to renegotiate the option anyway.  Shall I call and suggest this 
this flat fee for retooling the option agreement to them or shall we do it 
together?  I,m not sure I could explain to them acequately the idiosyncrasies 
of our accounting requirements.

How much is it and should this be the final amount?  One thought I have is 
that maybe we can retool the option agreement so that we pay them a flat fee, 
which is enough to cover the expenditures.  Don't know if this works, but it 
is one thought.  What do you think?

One more thing on the SDEC project:  According to the option agreement we 
executed last October, we agreed to reimburse Certosa Holdings for actual 
third party costs that they incurred in support of our necessary 
applications, submittals and in seeking local approval.  Several weeks ago, 
we recieved an invoice from Shutts & Bowen, attorney for Certosa Holdings 
requesting reimbursement pursuant to the contract.  I forwarded this invoice 
on th Ann Elizabeth not necessarily to pay for but to review considering this 
whole soft cost hard cost discussion.  I recieved another call this morning

I have since met with Ben on this agreement but wanted to let you see my 
comments as you are incorporating Deerfield's changes.  I was in meetings all 
day and just realized that I never sent this out.

Finance comments.  I have left a message with Rose asking what her comments 
to you were so we could coordinate.  Since I haven't heard from her yet I 
will provide these and follow-up if there are any others which need 
mentioning after I speak with her.

1.  The Effective Date needs to change to "2001"

2.  In Section 2 Landscaping: To avoid any accounting issues raised by 
Accounting, it would be very helpful and along the intent as you indicated to 
Billy, if you would add at the beginning: "After commencement of construction 
of the Facility but prior to the issuance of a CofO......."

3.  Section 4 needs to have a global search done to change all the "PBEC"s to 
"DBEC"s.

4.  Section 6:  Is the Facility truly deemed a "Factory" for permitting fees 
or are we changing the normal classification for a power plant in this 
agreement?

5.  Section 7(b):  Will we be charging the City for the easement for their 
cellular tower?  What is the consideration otherwise for doing so since we 
are paying them all sorts of money for the other items for which we are using 
the City?

 Extra period at the end of this Section.

6.  In the Termination Section can we put in the language from Pompano Beach 
which said that if the Agreement is terminated, all parties relieved of their 
obligations and an instrument would be recorded with County (offset to 
initial recordation of Agreement) indicating that Ag terminated and all 
obligations of the parties have been released?

7.  Does the City need to obtain any approvals prior to execution or at any 
other time to execute and have this be a valid agreement on their part?

8.  I noted that there is no Notices section nor Counterparts section.  Are 
they truly not needed here?  Execution occurring in same place on same doc?

Billy, 

It is expected that by the time the hard costs referenced in #2 are incurred, 
the project will be in E Next (or its successor/take out vehicle) since 
construction will be nearly complete.  Costs incurred in #3 should be Phase 2 
E Next costs, since this should be in the construction period, although it 
could be immediately prior to that time.  

Lisa, I skipped Rose on this email since she is out of town, and reviewed 
this agreement before she left.

Yes. Let's do 1:30 for an internal call.  I'll get Suzanne to send out the

Read your notes re scheduling a call w/ or w/o GE.  From John's and my 
perspective, it seems that we should first have an internal call re the 
consolidation of our assignments from weeks past  into Peter's draft contract 
and then send to GE for their review and follow up call either later this 
week or next.  Steve Swift is OK with this approach.  

At the moment we seem to be knee deep w/GE and Owner on Arcos and suspect 
that 9:30 CST (3:30 London time) will be difficult for us to call in.  
Instead, 1:30 CST would work better for us.  

If this works for the Houston gang could you let us know soonest and we will 
let Mike and Steve know as well.

Would you all be in a posiotion to get together tomorrow morning at 9:30 am 
Houston time to review the issues list and  talk about how we get to the end 
of this process with GE.  We immediately need to start the drafting of the 
Longview turbine contract and I'd like to see if we are close enough to get 
that started.  Scott, today the extension to the Agreement in Principle 
expires and we need to extend.  Can you tee this up with Steve Swift?  Our 
meeting tomorrow will be in lieu of the regularly scheduled GE call.  I'll 
let them know we will call them later this week or we'll talk next Wednesday, 
but I would like to get through whatever we need to in order to get the 
Longview Turbine Contract going.  
I've talked to John Schwartzenburg about this and he is available tomorrow 
morning.

i guess he'll be a better reliever, if the pressure doesn't make him go

I have begun drafting of the override letter to accompany the GE
Form Agreement.  It is sufficiently different from the LM 6000 deals
that it is taking more time than I had anticipated.  Have you all done
any override letters for other deals such as Coyote? If so, it would
make things move faster since the Coyote agreement was the basis for the
form.

I talked with Bob Cook, thinking that as he's the organizer of the blood
drives, he might have a name or two of platelet donors.  The two people who
were going to donate Platelets for Michael today "bailed" for various
reasons, and my wife has tapped out her resources for platelet donors and
I've tapped out mine.  Bob suggested you might contact the people on the
prayer list.  What's needed is people with type O blood (either + or -).  If
anyone is able to do so today, that'd be GREAT.  And if tomorrow or some
other day, that would be great also.

If anyone can donate,  please have him/her call my wife, Bev, at 713
972-6840.  That's the number for both Michael's room and the visitor's room
adjacent to  Michael's room.  They should not call there before noon.  If
they want to call before that or late in the evening (we usually leave the
hospital around 9:30 and get home around 10:30), they can call 281 360-5665
and leave a message.

Thanks.

Tricia, thank you for Kay Mann's  refund in the amount of $500 for the 
above-referenced seminar.  The cost of the seminar, however,  was $595.  I 
cancelled this seminar two days before the cancellation deadline of March13, 
2001 (cancellation number X197033661), but Kay was still charged the $95 
cancellation administrative fee.  Please advise when she can expect this $95 
to be credited to her American Express card.  

Thanks, Suzanne Adams

Kay:

We told Paul Hastings that we would release our Guaranty and the Opinion at
closing on Wednesday.  They were okay with that.  If that's a problem, I can
fax the guaranty and opinion (once I have it signed), with a letter from me
saying you can't release it until funding...

Good morning.

In order to finish up Delta/Salmon tomorrow, please note we need the
following today:

GE parent guaranty
LOC (so that full payment can be made to GE tomorrow)
Opinion of counsel

And once funds are received by GE, we need the receipt of funds letter.

Lee, I haven't heard back from the Portland gang to find out if the LV Co
Gen contract is ready.  Maybe Jake can help shake that loose.

Thanks,

Kay

Isabel and Greg,

I'm having a logistical problem.  The only managing director of Salmon is
not in the office today.  I can have the membership certificates signed by
(1) a vice president or (1)  the managing member or (3) elect a new
managing director.  What's your preference?

We need the Master Gas Agreement between Yazoo and ENA executed ASAP !!
In the last meeting, it was stated that for Clarksdale we would have the 
third party supplier invoice
the Cities directly, however once the Yazoo rehab work was completed, ENA 
would be supplying and
invoicing Yazoo.  Yazoo is near completion on the work, and has already 
burned gas in their testing over
the past weekend. I currently have an imbalance with the pipe which  I need 
to repay ASAP.  Also once the 
Yazoo unit is completed, I have NO MECHANISM to deliver the gas until we 
execute the Master Gas as
was discussed two weeks ago.

The current form does not have the subcontract assignability language
and I agree that I am not sure we need 22.3.   Question to the team,
should I just put in the first part? Do we need language regarding an
Enron Corp. guarantee?

Peter:

Below is assignment language that we used in our going master before we
entered into the era of the off balance sheet structures.  I do not
recall
whether we have the subcontract assignability language.  I question
whether
we need 22.3.


This  Agreement or any right or obligation contained herein may be
assigned
by Purchaser without Seller's consent to:

(i)  an Affiliate;

(ii)  a  Joint  Venture, Partnership, or other similar entity in
which
Purchaser  or  Purchaser's  Affiliate  is  a venturer, partner
or
participant;

(iii)     Owner;

(iv) Lender; or

(v)   to  any  entity  for  the  purposes  of financing or sale of
the
Facility.

Except  for  (i)  through  (v)  above,  this  Agreement  may be assigned
by
Purchaser  to  other  parties only upon the prior written consent of
Seller
which shall not be unreasonably withheld.  When duly assigned in
accordance
with the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure
to
the  benefit  of  the  assignee; any other assignment by Purchaser shall
be
void and without force or effect.

22.3     Agreement  with  Lender.   Seller  agrees  that  if  requested
by
Purchaser,  Seller  shall  enter  into a direct agreement with Lender
under
which Lender is permitted to "step into" this Agreement.

22.4    Assignment  of  Vendor  Agreements.  All Seller's subcontracts
with
Vendor  which  have  prices equal to or greater than $500,000 shall
include
provisions  giving  Seller  an  unrestricted  right  to assign the
relevant
subcontract  and  call  benefits,  interests,  rights  and  cause of
action
arising under it to Purchaser without Vendor's prior permission.

Michael is to receive the bone marrow transplant sometime today.  Some or
you have thought it's a surgical procedure.  It's not.  Rather, it's done
through an IV.

He will be in need of quite a few platelet transfusions over the next while.
One can donate platelets more frequently than one can donate blood, but I
don't know much more than that about the frequency.  If you or your
friends/co-workers can donate platelets, please first contact my wife
(Beverly) to find out the exact schedule for Michael's need for them. As
they do not have a shelf life of more than 24-26 hours, they must be donated
one day for transfusion the next.  Bev is more or less staying with Michael
in the hospital.  You can reach her at (713) 792-6840 (that's the number for
Michael's room, but she has a 2nd line in the little visitor room to the
side of it).

Thanks so much for your help.  "Thanks" is a poor substitute for the
gratitude we have for your support, but . . .

Bob

Jeff,

Thanks for the update.  For purposes of keeping the contract straight, I also 
need the lien waiver.  A single invoice for the outstanding $1,502,355 will 
suffice.

As a heads up, we will probably need a substitute LC post assignment.

Regards,

Chris

Chris,

The bank will issue the LOC by the end of next week, perhaps as early as
Wednesday.  We are using E-Next Generation LLC as the beneficiary.  The LOC
will be mailed to you.  Do you still require a Lien Waiver?

Also, do you want new invoices?  If so, will one for $1,502,355 be
sufficient?

Regards,

Jeff

   Chris,

   I will get you re-established on PNet, with the correct e-mail address..
   For the B&V folks, I need names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers,
   (nice,
   but not required).

   Just a reminder, the site change process can not start until the new
   site
   conditions are identified to GE.  The cost and cycle estimate then takes
   about 4 weeks.

Kay:

I thought I would check in to determine the status of the escrow account
since it needs to be set up 30 days following the execution of the Letter
Agreement.  Let me know if I should follow up with Chris regarding the
details.

Regards,

Marisa

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center and Metropolitan garage are 
being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Sky Ring access is 
available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be 
used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have 
to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Please respond via e-mail if you are interested in acquiring one of these 
spaces.

Another Fort Pierce memo.

Subject: Ft. Pierce Attached Files

I sent you and Kathleen the memo I sent to Rusty about confidentiality 
provisions in the FPUA/FPRP project documents.

In regard to disclosure on Deal Bench, I think you  need to consider 
carefully the confidentiality restrictions in place under binding agreements 
that restrict ENA's ability to disclose contracts and other information and 
the need to keep certain of the attachments to the E-Mail that Rusty sent you 
confidential. 

There are binding confidentiality provisions in place with almost every 
counterparty to the executed and proposed to be executed Fort Pierce project 
documents, some with exceptions that would permit disclosure to potential 
assignees/transferees, some without such exceptions. A systematic review of 
the confidentiality provisions in force to ascertain the scope of the 
confidentiality restrictions needs to be completed before Deal Bench 
disclosure, and to my knowledge that has not taken place. Also be advised 
that the Fort Pierce Development Agreements are not negotiated to finality or 
signed, and I am concerned that such disclosure at this time - if FPUA 
learned of it - could result in the deal never being signed and/or a 
potential purchaser being misled about the terms of the FPUA/FPRP 
transaction. 

Apart from the foregoing considerations, I have asked that the opinions and 
certificates attached to the E-Mail Rusty forwarded to you be kept strictly 
confidential. They will change, and there are matters in the certificates 
that we don't want advertised to FPUA, on Deal Bench, or otherwise.

Finally, I am not aware of the scope of ENA's confidentiality obligations in 
cases when it is negotiating documents in its capacity as agent for E-Next 
Generation LLC. By copy hereof, I'm requesting Lisa Bills and Rose Engeldorf 
advise us if there are such restrictions that would limit disclosure to 
potential purchasers independent of the other confidentiality restrictions 
referred to above.

In short, before any documents are disclosed to third parties via Deal Bench, 
these matters need to be resolved, and I frankly am too busy right now trying 
to get the deal with FPUA signed to make the review my priority. Perhaps we 
should start by having Kathleen take a look at the provisions in the various 
executed FPRP documents to catalog the various restrictions applicable to the 
proposed Deal Bench disclosure?

Attached below are the latest docs. on Fort Pierce.  Please note that we are 
still awaiting some final comments from FPUA's attorney and Turbopark, but 
these should be very close to final form.  We should have all comments back 
and be in final form in a week to ten days if you want to wait to put the 
docs. into Deal bench.

Bart sent this e-mail out in response to Lisa Bill's request for a 
comprehensive list of all documents.  I think the only document missing is 
the FMPA steam agreement where we can use their units on an interruptible 
basis when they are not using them.  Please note that some of the documents 
are not for parties outside of Enron are confidential legal opinions.

Subject: Ft. Pierce Attached Files

As requested today, attached are the latest drafts of the FPUA/FPRP 
Development Agreements to be executed by FPUA and FPRP and the Tax and 
Aesthetics Agreements to be executed by the City of Fort Pierce and FPRP  ( 
to be delivered to FPRP at the execution of the other Development Agreements 
by FPUA). It may be helpful to open the Execution Date Deliveries document 
first to give you a checklist of the documents, and a rundown on permits. If 
you need an update on permitting, I will have to ask Scott and Jeffrey to 
help with that discussion. Note that the Equipment Lease for the chillers, 
the Equipment Lease for the cooling towers, and the Option to Lease for the 
cooling tower site ( and the Ground Lease, which will be appended to the 
Option to Lease) are in the process of being drafted now, and I will 
distribute them as soon as they are ready. DO NOT DISTRIBUTE THIS MEMO OR THE 
ATTACHED MEMO FROM A & k TO FPUA OR ANYONE OUTSIDE ENRON, AS THE CERTIFICATES 
TO BE DELIVERED IN CONNECTION WITH THE OPINIONS ARE STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL TO 
FPRP/ENRON.

In connection with our meeting Friday, a couple of other points worth noting 
are (1) Section 9.2 (c) of the Participation Agreement, added as a 
placeholder when the thought was to have a dump condenser and when its 
location was unknown,will be deleted, (2) references in Exhibits D and E to 
the dump condenser/system will be removed, references in Exhibit  D 
describing the FPRP Improvements will add references to the cooling tower and 
chillers, and references in Exhibit E to the demin system will remain. 

There are additional comments received from FPUA and its insurance 
consultants after preparation of the attached draft of the Participation 
Agreement , all of which have been blessed by David Marshall, that will be 
addressed in the next draft. 

We also know that the legal description and plot plan of the leased parcel in 
the Ground Lease will change to reflect the extension of the parcel 30' to 
the east, certain easements in favor of FPUA and FPRP described in the Ground 
Lease and the Easement Agreement will be affected by the extension,and we 
should have those descriptions and plans for the lease parcel description and 
affected easements tomorrow. 

We also have internal input from David Fairley ( Interconnection & 
Transmission), Mike Coleman ( Section 3.12, O & M, Annual Heat Rate Test ), 
Jeffrey Keenan ( Tolling and Interconnection & Transmission Agreement), and 
Rusty/Ron Tapscott ( Section 9.3, Participation Agreement, Transmission 
Upgrades Responsibilities) that needs to be reflected. 

Finally, note that the proposed FPRP and ENA legal opinion, and related FPRP 
Certificate, is being discussed by Rose with E-Next counsel, and we 
understand those documents will change based on those discussions.

As noted today, FPUA will give us its comments on the documents delivered to 
them on 5/9 this Friday, but we don't expect those comments to be material. 
We also don't expect there to be much discussion about the items noted above 
to be added to the last drafts seen by FPUA, except possible with respect to 
the Equipment Leases and Option to Lease, which will be new documents they 
have to review.

Herman:

Running all development documents past you prior to execution won't be a 
problem.  I think we all understand the involved risks, as well as the need 
for absolutely correct documentation.  For thoroughness, I'll run every doc 
past Lisa, too.  It just occured to me that a cover sheet showing a 
document's approval status could help eliminate some confusion.  As for 
review order, I will follow this sequence:  Development attorney, Rose, 
Herman and Lisa.   

Thanks,
Ed


To all:

Please have your assistants put me on your out-of-office notification list.  
I know this request is an intrusion, but it will help me manage various 
expectations imposed by the development teams.   On the topic of developer 
expectations, please take every opportunity to reinforce our document 
approval process.  

Thanks, again,
Ed

Thanks for the note.  From an accounting perspective, I may not underwrite 
the accounting risk in any document that I have not reviewed.  We have 
certain rules of engagement in transaction support that preclude me from 
doing so.  I will be glad to review any and all documents that come your 
way.  If they are in good shape, it should not take that long from a timing 
perspective.

Lisa:

Your request regarding review of the Hessler Agreement is timely.

In response to the attached string, I need to drop this post to you to fill 
you in on the process we've followed since our discovery of certain possible 
issues in consulting services agreements.   I have pending deadlines, so 
please excuse my tendency to hack and ramble when I'm in a hurry.

I'm sure you recall that you, Rose, Sheila and Herman recently signed off on 
a consulting services agreement for TurboPark compliance, I think the 
company's name was Universal Project Management ("UPM").  Rose asked me to 
scrub down the UPM agreement as a starting place or form for our future 
consulting services agreement requests, nothing set in stone just a good 
starting place (Hessler is the first consulting agreement under this 
experiment).  

 Per Rose and Bart, Rose and a project development attorney will review all 
future consulting services agreements prior to execution.   Due to the 
pending volume of work, Rose does not want to bother either you or Herman 
needlessly, so, if the revisions are insignificant Rose will not ask me to 
send the agreement to accounting and finance for review; however, significant 
deviations from the form will have to pass back through the full finance, 
accounting and legal approval process on a case by case basis.   

This process really fell out of four or five of our collective conversations 
over the last two or three days, so any comments, suggestions or objections 
are more than welcome.   At this point, we're hoping to decrease the time 
required to generate a consulting agreement for our developers.   Hopefully, 
we will enjoy a subsequent decrease in the interruptions, email and telephone 
traffic required for each consulting agreement.  

I may be reached at extension 31592.

Thanks,
Ed

John:  Hessler Associates has no problems with the attached draft agreement.
For clarification, paragraph 3.3 calls for bi-monthly invoices, whereas
Exhibit B indicates monthly invoices are acceptable.  Our practice is to
submit monthly invoices on lengthly projects, and at job completion for
short term duties.

I took a quick stab at John's redraft of Section 10.3.2 but think we should

 << File: GE-Take Over LD's - 10.3.2.doc >>

Williams/PDX/ECT@ECT, pthompson@akllp.com  cc:   Subject: Rigby's Proposal 
for Take Over LD's Section 10.3.2


Attached is a redline against the present Take Over LD section of Rev 5 of GE 
world hunger.   I made the changes based on what we have done in ARCOS. They 
are not the same because in ARCOS GE has the full testing program within 
their Commisssioning Period since they have the power island which is 1200 MW 
with the Purchaser having 24 MW for aux loads.

I do not think that my new subparagraph (K) works.  I have left it there to 
see if anyone else can tweak it and make it work.  I am trying to get GE on 
the hook for acceleration costs that we incur and still beat the Time for 
Completion.  We did not do that in Arcos since GE's time in theory is the 
same as the contractors.


Probably merits an internal discussion before sharing with GE.

last week? We would like to send a representative (or two) and would be happy 
to set a meeting up. Please let me know.

Regards,

Ben

Drawings were sent to Chuck Newell today.  As you stated, we need Sharon's
CA before Chuck can share technical detail with her.

Lynn:

Thanks for the e-mail. If Chuck's CA has been executed and returned to you,
then I would assume you can go ahead and send him the drawings. I
understand that if Sharon wants the drawings, she will have to sign a
seperate CA. Sending the drawings to Chuck, covered by his executed CA,
will certainly speed up the process. Let me know if you have any
objections.

Thanks,

Ben

Hello.

The commercial team  has asked that I forward this document to you for 
review.  It is a development agreement for a project in Florida.  We have 
attempted to address the accounting/E-Next issues, but please advise of any 
desired changes.

Thank you,

Kay

Kay,

I spoke to Raul Salas of Shutts & Bowen re: amending the arrangment we have 
for the Certosa Holdings property.  He called me back to say that his client 
will be in Miami Wednesday but wanted us to pay the Shutts & Bowen invoice 
before we meet.  I think Certosa Holdings is not paying its bills.  But they 
did remove the last lien on the property.  We will need to develop a 
structure where we pay something to Certosa Holdings so it can recoup some 
costs but we will also need to cover future legal and consulting costs 
incurred by Certosa Holdings. Can you help??  Would you be available for at 
least a call Wednesday or Thursday?  

I'll be back in Miami Tuesday but I can be reached over the weekend on my 
cell 713 857 0367 or my pager 877 461 4413.  I'll also try to check my email 
daily

On Friday, I will be at home.  One of my sons graduates on Saturday, so we 
have a house full of relatives starting Friday.  I'm not sure if I'm going to 
be in the office on Monday all day or partial day. In any case, if anybody 
needs anything, don't hesitate to call me at home or on the cell phone or via 
home e-mail.

In the meantime, I will e-mail the info requested and other updates to you.

Thanks and have a good weekend -- David

Read your notes re scheduling a call w/ or w/o GE.  From John's and my 
perspective, it seems that we should first have an internal call re the 
consolidation of our assignments from weeks past  into Peter's draft contract 
and then send to GE for their review and follow up call either later this 
week or next.  Steve Swift is OK with this approach.  

At the moment we seem to be knee deep w/GE and Owner on Arcos and suspect 
that 9:30 CST (3:30 London time) will be difficult for us to call in.  
Instead, 1:30 CST would work better for us.  

If this works for the Houston gang could you let us know soonest and we will 
let Mike and Steve know as well.

Would you all be in a posiotion to get together tomorrow morning at 9:30 am 
Houston time to review the issues list and  talk about how we get to the end 
of this process with GE.  We immediately need to start the drafting of the 
Longview turbine contract and I'd like to see if we are close enough to get 
that started.  Scott, today the extension to the Agreement in Principle 
expires and we need to extend.  Can you tee this up with Steve Swift?  Our 
meeting tomorrow will be in lieu of the regularly scheduled GE call.  I'll 
let them know we will call them later this week or we'll talk next Wednesday, 
but I would like to get through whatever we need to in order to get the 
Longview Turbine Contract going.  
I've talked to John Schwartzenburg about this and he is available tomorrow 
morning.

Steve knows I am pissed about this and in our Arcos meeting I brought up the 
same point raised by Kay below.  Steve claims that the no cap on gov. 
violations was rejected some time ago by GE mana. when Barnas presented to 
them an update of the "end world hunger".  Steve also thinks that they had 
told us previously about this change.  ( Is this true???)  I told him it was 
news to me and that I would have thought that if true, then GE would have (a) 
highlighted the changes on the draft contract and/or (b) added it to the list 
of outstanding issues.

When asked to explain the rationale for changing their position on this 
issue, Steve was unable to give an answer other than to say GE mana. had said 
that they needed to cap their liability at the contract price for gov. 
violations although they thought GE could live with no cap on FCPA violations.

Did Steve S ask that it be added to the list?  I would let them bring it up 
if he didn't.  We spent quite a bit of time and effort on the LOL clause, and 
it was subject to lots of give and take.

GE has informed us during the Arcos discussion that GE senior management has 
directed that the GE deal team cannot agree to allowing GE indemnity 
obligations related with government fines for failure to comply with law to 
be exclude from the limit of liability.  


This needs to be added to Pete T's World Hunger Punchlist of issues.

Enron Arcos deal team has not agreed to GE's position.
